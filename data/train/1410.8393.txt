    "core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) originate from the gravitational collapse of the iron cores formed by massive stars ( @xmath7 ) that can not be supported by further exothermal thermonuclear reactions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . an important sub - class of cc - sne is represented by type ii - plateau events ( sne ii - p ) characterized by the presence of hydrogen in their spectra @xcite and a luminosity `` plateau '' that lasts for @xmath8 days , after the blue band maximum of the light curve @xcite .",
    "the plateau is powered by the recombination of hydrogen in the sn ejecta .",
    "when the recombination ends , the lightcurve drops sharply by several magnitudes in @xmath9 days ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this transition phase is followed by a linear `` radioactive tail '' , where the light curve is powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath10co to @xmath10fe . in this phase",
    "the sn luminosity depends on the amount of @xmath10ni synthesized in the explosion ( e.g. @xcite ) . +",
    "both theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and empirical ( e.g. @xcite ) investigations show that type ii - p sne are generally associated with red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "a minor fraction of them ( less than @xmath11 , e.g. @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) results from the explosion of a blue supergiant , similar to sn 1987a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical models predict that type ii - p sne are the final fate of progenitors between @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most progenitors identified in high - resolution archival images were found to be rsgs of initial masses between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the apparent lack of high - mass progenitors has been dubbed as the `` rsg problem '' ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the existence of this discrepancy has been further confirmed by studies of the massive star population in local group galaxies , for which rsgs have been found to have masses up to @xmath17 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ the reason for this lack of detection of massive rsg progenitors is still debated .",
    "a possible solution of the rsg problem was presented by @xcite .",
    "they speculate that an underestimation of the luminosity of the rsg sn progenitors ( and therefore of their masses ) might occur if we neglect the presence of an additional extinction due to dust production in the rsg winds .",
    "they estimated a new upper limit for the mass range of @xmath18 , which is , within the errors , marginally consistent with the range derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the use of standard interstellar extinction laws may overestimate the effects of the reddening .",
    "+ a different approach to estimate the mass of type ii - p sn progenitors is based on the use of hydrodynamic modelling of the sn evolution .",
    "this allows us to determine the ejecta mass , explosion energy , pre - sn radius and ni mass by performing a simultaneous comparison between the observed and simulated light curves , the evolution of line velocities and the continuum temperature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pre - explosion mass is calculated from the ejecta mass assuming the mass of a neutron star remnant ( @xmath19 ) and mass loss through stellar winds .",
    "the hydrodynamic modelling of several well - observed type ii - p sne ( sne 1997d , @xcite ; 1999em , @xcite ; 2003z , @xcite and @xcite ; 2004et , @xcite ; 2005cs , @xcite ; 2009kf , @xcite ) determined higher masses for the progenitors than those derived from the analysis of pre - explosion images .",
    "this discrepancy either points to systematic errors in the analysis of pre - explosion images or in the assumptions in the physiscs of the hydrodinamical modelling ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ another method to estimate the mass of the progenitor is the modeling of nebular phase spectroscopic observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which provide good agreement with estimates obtained by the analysis of pre - explosion images .",
    "+ the astrophysical interest in type ii - p sne is twofold : 1 ) observations show that type ii - p sne are the most common explosions in the nearby universe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and 2 ) starting from the pioneering suggestion by @xcite , type ii - p sne have been proposed as robust distance indicators .",
    "two different approaches are used to derive distance measurements of sne ii - p .",
    "the theoretical approach is based on spectral modelling like the expanding photosphere method ( e.g. @xcite ) or the spectral expanding atmosphere method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "empirical approaches exploit the observed correlation between the luminosity of a type ii - p sn and its expansion velocity ( e.g. , the standardized candle method , @xcite ) or the steepness of the light curve after the plateau phase @xcite .",
    "the @xcite method , refined for example by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , has an intrinsic accuracy of @xmath20 @xcite ; slightly larger than the accuracy obtained for type ia sne ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "type ii - p sne can , importantly , be observed out to cosmological distances ( e.g. @xcite ) ; with the advantage of being that they arise from a homogenous progenitor population .",
    "the @xcite method can , therefore , be used as an independent health check of the sn ia - based distance scale .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of sn 2012ec , which exploded in ngc 1084 .",
    "the early data were collected via the large program `` supernova variety and nuclesosynthesis yelds''(pi s. benetti ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the data has been collected via the eso public survey pessto ( `` public eso spectroscopic survey of transient objects '' , pi s.j .",
    "the observations of sn 2012ec were analysed in conjunction with the hydrodynamical codes described in @xcite and @xcite , and information on the progenitor obtained from high - resolution pre - explosion images .",
    "the same analysis has already performed for two other type ii - p sne : sn 2012a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and sn 2012aw ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to carry out an homogeneous comparative study of these three sne , and to identify possible systematic discrepancies in the estimates of the masses of the progenitors derived from different techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the discovery and the detection of the progenitor of sn 2012ec ; in section 3 we discuss the properties of the host galaxy , the distance and the extinction ; in section 4 we present the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometric evolution of sn 2012ec , and compare its colour evolution and bolometric light curve with those of other type ii - p sne . in section 5",
    "we present the optical and nir spectroscopic observations . in section 6",
    "we discuss the results of the modeling of the data and in section 7 we present a detailed comparison of sn 2012ec with the type ii - p sne 2012a and 2012aw . in section 8",
    "we consider these three sne in the context of the scm and in section 9 we discuss our results .",
    "sn 2012ec was discovered by @xcite in the almost face - on ( @xmath21 , @xcite ) spiral galaxy ngc 1084 on 2012 august 11.039 ut ( mjd=56150.04 ) .",
    "@xcite classified sn 2012ec as a very young type ii - p sn , probably a few days post - explosion . in fig .",
    "[ comp ] we show this early spectrum of sn 2012ec ( collected on 2012 , august 13 with wifes , mjd @xmath22 ) , compared with sn 2006bp @xcite at five different epochs .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2012ec is very similar to those of sn 2006bp @xcite obtained at @xmath12 and @xmath23 days after the explosion , implying that the sn was observed at @xmath24 days post - explosion and giving an explosion epoch of @xmath25 days before the discovery .",
    "we explicitly note that our estimate is slightly different from the one given by @xcite , who estimated the explosion date at @xmath26 days before the discovery by comparison with spectra of sn  1999em .",
    "the explosion epoch of sn 2006bp is much more tightly constrained than that of sn 1999em , because it is based on the detection of shock breakout ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates obtained by using either sn 2006bp or sn 1999em , as reference , are in agreement within the errors .",
    "we adopt , therefore , a conservative constraint on the explosion date of @xmath27 days prior to discovery and define the zero phase as our estimated explosion epoch of mjd @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite identified a progenitor candidate in pre - explosion hubble space telescope ( hst ) images .",
    "photometry of the progenitor candidate was compared with synthetic photometry of marcs spectral energy distributions ( sed ) @xcite , which suggested that the progenitor of sn 2012ec was a rsg with an initial mass in the range @xmath29 .",
    "spectra of sn 2006bp , from day @xmath30 to @xmath31 . ]",
    "the sn is located @xmath32e and @xmath33n of the nucleus of the host galaxy ngc 1084 ( see fig [ fc ] ) . details of ngc  1084 are presented in table [ galprop ] .",
    "ngc 1084 previously hosted @xmath34 known sne : the type ii - p sn 2009h @xcite , the type ii sne 1998dl @xcite and 1996an @xcite , and the type ia sn 1963p @xcite .",
    "the distances available in the literature for ngc 1084 are principally based on the tully - fisher relation , and we adopt the value @xmath35 mag , available in the extragalactic distance database / edd.ifa.hawaii.edu/ ] @xcite .",
    "the galactic reddening towards sn  2012ec was estimated from the @xcite dust maps to be @xmath36 mag .",
    "the internal reddening in ngc  1084 was derived using the measured equivalent widths ( ew ) of nai d ( @xmath37 , @xmath38  ) , observed in a low - resolution spectrum at @xmath39 days .",
    "the measured value was @xmath40  from which we obtained @xmath41 mag using the @xcite calibration and @xmath42 mag using the @xcite calibration .",
    "these two values are in good agreement and we adopt @xmath43 mag for the host galaxy reddening .    assuming a @xcite reddening law ( @xmath44 ) , we estimate the total galactic and host @xmath45band extinction towards sn  2012ec to be @xmath46 mag .",
    ".properties of ngc 1084.[galprop ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + quoted errors for the scm distances are the standard deviations of the individual calibrations . the value of the distance from the primary indicators of sn 2012aw is the average from the cepheids @xcite and the trgb @xcite estimates . finally , the `` mean residual '' column shows the average of the scm @xmath47 secondary values , where the error is the standard deviation .",
    "table [ distances ] may suggest that the @xcite calibration gives more homogenous results with respect to other calibrations .",
    "however , it must be noted that our test is based on only three sne and that all the calibrations are consistent within the errors .",
    "we note that the @xcite calibration was derived assuming a value of @xmath48 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 , significantly lower than the estimate of @xmath50 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 of @xcite , but in agreement with @xmath51 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 given by @xcite .",
    "the large scatter in the @xcite calibration could be due to the difficulty in estimating the reference phase , when a well sampled light curve covering the end of the plateau , is not available .",
    "all these calibrations rely on moderately distant sne , embedded in the hubble flow or for which sbf distances are available .",
    "however , these distances could still be affected by systematics not completely understood . for these reasons a new calibration of the scm , based on nearby type ii - p sne for which primary ( cepheids and trgb ) and homogenous secondary indicators ( trgb ) distances are available , would be of great interest .",
    "moreover , for these sne the metallicity effects suggested by @xcite could also be investigated .",
    "the average of the five individual estimates of the distances for sn 2012ec gives a distance modulus of @xmath52 mag , which we adopt as our final scm - based distance .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the tully - fisher distance of @xmath53 , adopted for our analysis .",
    "we have presented the results of the large program `` supernova variety and nuclesosynthesis yelds '' and pessto photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of sn 2012ec .",
    "this is one of the most intensively observed and well investigated type ii - p sne to date .",
    "the optical and spectrocopic monitoring during the photospheric phase lasted for @xmath54 days and allowed us to determine the evolution of the pseudo - bolometric luminosity , the expansion velocity and the photospheric temperature and @xmath55 mass .",
    "these parameters , analysed in conjunctions with hydrodynamical models , allowed us to estimate the explosion parameters such as the explosion energy , the envelope mass and the pre - sn radius . correcting the data for reddening ( @xmath56 mag ) and distance modulus ( @xmath57 ) we estimated the luminosity to be @xmath58 , at the plateau and evaluated the @xmath55 mass to be @xmath59 .",
    "the spectra of sn 2012ec were dominated by balmer lines in the early epochs and after 20 days the iron - group elements started to appear and become more prominent with time .",
    "the nir spectra were dominated by paschen lines and , starting from 68 days , it is possible to identify he i , ca i and @xmath60 .",
    "a black body fit to the continuum gives temperatures of @xmath61 k in the early epoches decreasing to @xmath62 k at 50 days and @xmath63 k in the last epochs . from the spectroscopic dataset we estimate an initial velocity of @xmath64 for the @xmath65 line and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath65 velocity decreases to @xmath68 by 50 days . at @xmath69 days",
    "the iron - group elements appear , for which we measure a velocity of @xmath70 ( for fe ii ) .",
    "the behaviour of sn 2012ec is similar to that seen in other ii - p sne , such as sn 1999em @xcite and sn 2004et @xcite .",
    "+ we estimate the physical parameters of sn 2012ec through the hydrodynamical modeling described in sect .",
    "[ modelling ] .",
    "the fit suggests an ejected mass of @xmath71 , a pre - sn radius of @xmath72 , an explosion energy of @xmath73 and an ejected @xmath74 .",
    "the progenitor mass is in agreement with independent estimate of @xcite @xmath75 obtained by analyzing pre - explosion images and of @xcite , submitted , @xmath76 obtained from modeling of the spectra in the nebular phase .",
    "previously reported ejecta masses estimated from hydrodynamical modelling are generally too large compared to the initial mass estimated from direct detections of the progenitor on pre - explosion images @xcite . in order to investigate this discrepancy",
    ", we performed an homogeneous comparison between three type ii - p sne , estimating the mass of the progenitor with two different approaches .",
    "the methods and the codes used for the three objects in both cases are the same , to facilitate a reliable comparison .",
    "we analyze the bright sn 2012aw @xcite , the low - luminosity sn 2012a @xcite and sn 2012ec .",
    "several observational and derived parameters have been compared for these three objects .",
    "sn 2012aw ( @xmath77 mag , at plateau ) is brighter then sn 2012ec ( @xmath78 mag ) , while sn 2012a is fainter ( @xmath79 mag ) .",
    "a comparison between the bolometric light curves shows that sn 2012ec has an intermediate luminosity between the high luminosity sn 2012aw and the fainter sn 2012a .",
    "the nickel mass synthetized by these sne is @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "a spectroscopic comparison shows a similar time evolution at all epochs .",
    "the velocities of @xmath65 , @xmath67 and fe ii of sn 2012ec , place it in the middle of the higher velocities from sn 2012aw and the slowest sn 2012a at all times .",
    "the temperatures estimated are comparable for the three objects within the first 20 days , rather sn 2012ec tend to be similar to sn 2012a and they both are hotter than sn 2012aw .",
    "sn 2012aw has a more energetic explosion ( @xmath83 foe ) than sn 2012ec and sn 2012a ( @xmath84 foe ) , but sn 2012ec is also more energetic than sn 2012a .",
    "we finally compared the results of the direct detection of the progenitors of these three sne with the masses estimated from the hydrodynamical modelling .",
    "the progenitor mass estimated for sn 2012aw from the pre - explosion images ( @xmath85 ) and from the hydrodynamical modeling ( @xmath86 ) show that the two methods are not in good agreement and that sn 2012aw has a more massive progenitor then sn 2012ec , the last one having comparable ejecta mass with sn 2012a ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) .",
    "the estimated initial radius of sn 2012aw ( @xmath89 cm ) indicate a larger progenitor then for sn 2012ec and sn 2012a ( @xmath90 cm ) .",
    "the estimates of the initial radius from the hydrodynamical modelling for the three objects is lower than those from the pre - explosion images and seem to be too low for a rsg progenitor .",
    "this homogeneous analysis finds a substantial match , within the errors , of the mass of the progenitor obtained with the two methods , mitigating the discrepancy which was pointed out in previous works @xcite .",
    "sn 2012ec , sn 2012aw and sn 2012a also follow the relation obtained by @xcite .",
