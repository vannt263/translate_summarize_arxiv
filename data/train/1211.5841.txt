    "measurements of single ( * sd * ) , double(*dd * ) and central(*cd * ) diffraction dissociation is among the priorities of the lhc research program .    in the past , intensive studies of high - energy diffraction dissociation were performed at the fermilab , on fixed deuteron target , and at the isr , see @xcite for an overview and relevant references .",
    "[ fig:2sd.fermilab ] shows representative curves of low - mass sd as measured at the fermilab .",
    "one can see the rich resonance structure there , typical for low missing masses , often ignored by extrapolating whole region by a simple @xmath2 dependence . when extrapolating ( in energy ) , one should however bear in mind that , in the isr region , secondary reggeon contributions are still important ( their relative contribution depends on momenta transfer considered ) , amounting to nearly @xmath3 in the forward direction . at the lhc , however ,",
    "their contribution in the nearly forward direction in negligible , i.e. less than the relevant error bars in the measured total cross section @xcite .    in most of the papers on the subject sd",
    "is calculated from the triple regge limit of an inclusive reaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplereggelimit ] .    in that limit",
    ", the double diffraction cross section can be written as @xcite @xmath4    this approach has two shortcomings .",
    "the first one is that it leaves outside the small-@xmath5 resonance region .",
    "the second one is connected with the fact that whatever the pomeron , the ( partial ) sd cross section overshoots the total one , thus obviously conflicting with unitarity .",
    "various ways of resolving this deficiency are known from the literature , including the vanishing ( decoupling ) of the triple pomeron coupling , but none of them can be considered completely satisfactory .",
    "we instead follow the idea put forward in paper @xcite and developed further in ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which the reggeon ( here , the pomeron ) is similar to the photon and that the reggeon - nucleon interaction is similar to deep - inelastic photon - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , with the replacement @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "there is an obvious difference between the two : while the @xmath8 parity of the photon is negative , it is positive for the pomeron .",
    "we believe that while the dynamics is essentially invariant under the change of @xmath8 , the difference between the two being accounted for by the proper choice of the parameters . furthermore , while jaroszewicz and landshoff @xcite , in their pomeron - nucleon dis structure function ( sf ) ( or @xmath9 total cross section ) use the regge asymptotic limit , we include also the low missing mass , resonance behavior . as is known , gauge invariance requires the dis sf to vanish as @xmath10 ( here , @xmath11 .",
    "this property is built in the sf , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and it has important consequences for the behavior of the resulting cross sections at low @xmath12 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : appendix ] . appendix ) , not shared by the models based on the triple regge limit , see @xcite .",
    "it is evident that regge factorization is essential in both approaches ( triple regge and the present one ) .",
    "it is feasible when regge singularities are isolated poles .",
    "while the pre - lhc data require the inclusion of secondary reggeons , at the lhc we are in the fortunate situation of a single pomeron exchange ( pomeron dominance ) in the @xmath12 channel in single and double diffraction ( not necessarily so in central diffraction , to be treated elsewhere ) .",
    "secondary regge pole exchanges will appear however , in our dual - regge treatment of @xmath9 scattering ( see below ) , not to be confused with the the @xmath12 channel of @xmath13 .",
    "this new situation makes diffraction at the lhc unique in the sense that for the first time regge - factorization is directly applicable .",
    "we make full use of it .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : prelhc ] contains a short overview on the pre - lhc measurements of ( mainly ) single and double diffraction dissociation and their theoretical interpretation .",
    "[ sec : factor ] presents simple factorization relations that connecting dd with elastic and sd cross sections .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the dual - regge model @xcite , the ( non - linear ) @xmath1 regge trajectory , the roper resonance and summarize the main formulae used in our calculations .",
    "fits to the data ( figures an tables ) , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , are preceded by a brief introduction to our fitting strategy . in the appendix ( sec .",
    "[ sec : appendix ] ) we present some results of the main text but with the kinematical factor causing a dramatic turn down of the cross sections as @xmath12 approaches @xmath14 .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "diffraction dissociation was predicted by theory ( for a historical review and relevant references see @xcite ) and was intensively studied prior to the lhc on fixed targets ( deuteron jets ) at the fermilab by a very successful soviet - us collaboration @xcite and subsequently at the isr , sps and rhic colliders , see @xcite for more details .",
    "below we briefly summarize the results and conclusions of those studies , mainly of single sd .",
    "first measurements concerned low missing masses near the threshold region .",
    "resonance peaks e.g. in the reaction @xmath15 , depending on the relevant value of the momentum transfer @xmath12 , were observed beyond the threshold . the origin and properties of theses peaks , still subject of debates , were revealed .",
    "the main deficiency of the missing mass method is the lack of any information on the decay properties of the produced particles .",
    "the missing information was obtained in bubble chamber experiments and in spark chambers , used also in exclusive channels at the isr collider .",
    "apart from low missing masses , sd was found to persist also to high missing masses .",
    "diffraction ( coherence ) imposes , however , an upper limit on the highest missing masses @xmath16 , roughly as @xmath17 .    beyond the resonance region ,",
    "the smooth @xmath16 dependence of the cross section is approximated by @xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is related to the intercept of the trajectories exchanged in the proton - reggeon scattering , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ subsec : duality ]    \\2 .",
    "as expected , sd and dd are peaked in the forward direction , and the slope of the exponential peak of sd was found to be around @xmath21  gev@xmath22 , varying with @xmath23 and @xmath5 . near the threshold , the slope is much ( about twice ) larger than that in elastic scattering , however near @xmath24  gev it is already half of that of elastic @xmath13 .",
    "the correlation between the slope parameter and the mass of the excited state is a common feature of sd .",
    "a diffraction minimum around @xmath25  gev@xmath26 , similar to that in elastic hadron scattering , is expected also in sd ( and dd ) .",
    "there are indications @xcite of such a structure in @xmath27 at rather small @xmath28 , around @xmath29  gev@xmath26 at @xmath30  gev , however its origin , fate and affinity to the dip - bump structure in elastic scattering is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "diffraction is limited both in the missing mass ( coherence ) , @xmath31 and in @xmath12 ( `` soft '' collisions ) .",
    "there is a transition region in @xmath12 from `` soft '' to `` hard '' collisions , with a possible dip - bump structure between the two . to be sure , in our analysis",
    "we leave outside these interesting but controversial points , concentrating on the `` first '' cone with clear exponential behavior .    before the advent of the lhc",
    ", single diffraction dissociation was intensively studied in many different experiments : low energy isr and sps cern experiments , low energy fermilab ( fixed deuteron target ) experiments and high energy ua4 , ua5 , e710 and cdf experiments .",
    "all they cover the range @xmath32  gev , @xmath33  gev@xmath26 , and missing masses range from the threshold up to @xmath34 . here",
    "the diffraction region is limited up to @xmath34 . at @xmath36 non - diffraction contribution",
    "become sizable to diffractive one , and differential cross section become growing with @xmath37 .",
    "the main results of these measurements and of their theoretical interpretation can be summarized as follows , for details see , e.g. @xcite :    \\1 .",
    "* energy dependence . * at energies below 30  gev the integrated sd cross section rises with @xmath38 according to the standard prescription of the the regge - pole theory , however it slows down beyond .",
    "this effect was expected due to the familiar problem related to the violation of unitarity , namely that at high energies , implying the triple pomeron limit , the dd cross section overshoot the total cross section , @xmath39 various means were suggested @xcite to remedy this deficiency , including decoupling ( vanishing ) of the triple pomeron vertex .",
    "k. goulianos instead renormalizes the standard pomeron flux to meet the data , see @xcite .",
    "such a `` renormalization '' produces a break near @xmath40 slowing down the rise of @xmath41 in accord with the cdf data from the tevatron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : break ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .        .",

    ". * @xmath42 dependence .",
    "* sd cross section and the slope @xmath43 were measured in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the diffraction cone in sd essentially is exponential in @xmath12 ; a dip , similar to that in elastic scattering , is likely to appear ( somewhere near @xmath45  gev@xmath26 ) . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the cone of sd differential cross section shows a turn - down towards small-@xmath28 due to the kinematical factor .",
    "experimentally this turn - down was not yet confirmed .",
    "we ignore this effect in the main part of this work but will show it in the appendix .",
    "this tiny effect is located in the kinematical region where coulomb interaction is sizable , so it may hide the fine structure of the cone . however , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in sd ( and dd ) , coulomb interaction , at small squared momenta transfers , is suppressed compared to that in elastic diffraction @xmath13 scattering , allowing for a better determination of the strongly interacting part of the amplitude ( in @xmath46 at small @xmath28 this is possible only indirectly , by means of the bethe - heitler interference formula ) .",
    "* @xmath5 dependence .",
    "* probably , this is the most delicate issue in the present studies ( and diffraction in general ) . at the isr , fermilab and tevatron",
    ", sd was measured in a wide span of the missing mass , starting from the inelastic threshold @xmath47 up to @xmath48 ( or even to @xmath34 and higher ) , fig .",
    "[ fig:2sd.fermilab](b ) .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2sd.fermilab ] , there is a rich resonance structure in the small @xmath5 region . in most of the papers on the subject",
    ", this resonance structure is ignored and replaced by a smooth function @xmath49 . moreover ,",
    "this simple power - like behavior is extended to the largest available missing masses . in secs .",
    "[ sec : model ] and [ sec : results ] we question this point on the following reasons : a ) the low-@xmath5 , resonances introduce strong irregularities in the behavior of the resulting cross sections .",
    "lhc measurements , are able to probe low-@xmath5 region , and will be sensitive to these structures .",
    "b ) the large-@xmath50 behavior of the amplitude ( cross sections ) is another delicate point .",
    "essentially , it is determined by the proton - pomeron ( @xmath51 ) total cross section , proportional to the @xmath51 structure function , discussed in details in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . by duality ,",
    "the averaged contribution from resonances sums up to produce high missing mass regge behavior @xmath52 where @xmath20 is related to the intercept of the exchanged reggeon and may be close ( but not necessarily equal ) to the above - mentioned empirical value @xmath53 .    in our calculations of the large-@xmath50 behavior ( secs .",
    "[ sec : model ] and [ sec : results ] ) we shall refer also to the isr - tevatron - cdf data , remembering that for low energies ( @xmath54  gev ) , non - leading regge exchanges are also important @xcite .",
    "with the advent of the lhc , diffraction , elastic and inelastic scattering entered a new area , where it can be seen uncontaminated by non - diffraction events . in terms of the regge - pole theory",
    "this means , that the scattering amplitude is completely determined by a pomeron exchange , and in a simple - pole approximation , regge factorization holds and it is of practical use !",
    "remind that the pomeron is not necessarily a simple pole : perturbative qcd suggests that the pomeron is made of an infinite number of poles ( useless in practice ) , and the unitarity condition requires corrections to the simple pole , whose calculation is far from unique .",
    "instead a simple pomeron pole approximation @xcite is efficient in describing a variety of diffraction phenomena .",
    "the d - l elastic scattering amplitude is simply @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the signature factor , and @xmath57 is the ( linear ) pomeron trajectory .",
    "the signature factor can be written as @xmath58 , however it is irrelevant here , since below we shall use only cross sections ( squared modules of the amplitude ) , where it reduces to unity .",
    "the residue is chosen to be a simple exponential , @xmath59 .",
    "`` minus one '' in the propagator term @xmath60 of ( [ dl ] ) correspond for normalization @xmath61 .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath62 is not fixed by the regge - pole theory : it can be fitted do the data or fixed to a `` plausible '' value of a hadronic mass , or to the inverse `` string tension '' ( inverse of the pomeron slope ) , @xmath63 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) , corresponding to sub - leading reggeons , has the same functional form as the first one ( that of the pomeron ) , just the values of the parameters differ .",
    "we ignore this term for reason mentioned above .",
    "[ fig : feynmandiagrams ] shows the simplest configurations of regge - pole diagrams for elastic , single- and double diffraction dissociation , as well as central diffraction dissociation ( cd ) . in this paper",
    "we consider only sd and dd .",
    "factorization of the regge residue @xmath64 and the `` propagator '' @xmath60 is a basic property of the theory . as mentioned , at the lhc for the first time , we have the opportunity to test directly regge - factorization in diffraction , since the scattering amplitude here is dominated by a simple pomeron - pole exchange , identical in elastic and inelastic diffraction .",
    "simple factorization relations between elastic ( @xmath65 ) , single ( @xmath66 and double ( @xmath67 dd are known from the literature @xcite . really , by writing the scattering amplitude as product of the vertices , elastic @xmath68 and inelastic @xmath69 , multiplied by the ( universal ) propagator ( pomeron exchange ) , @xmath70 for elastic scattering , sd and dd , respectively , one gets @xmath71    assuming @xmath72 as a @xmath42dependence for both sd and elastic scattering , integration over @xmath12 yields : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .    for @xmath13 interactions at the isr , @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 .",
    "taking the value @xmath75 , consistent with the experimental results at fermilab and isr , one obtains @xmath77 .",
    "notice that for @xmath78 thus @xmath79 is very sensitive to the ratio @xmath80 , which shows that direct measurements of the slopes at the lhc are important .",
    "interestingly , relation ( [ factor2 ] ) can be used in different ways , e.g. to cross check any among the four inputs .    to summarize this discussion",
    ", we emphasize the important role of the ratio between the inelastic and elastic slope , which at the lhc is close to its critical value @xmath81 ( it can not go below ! ) , which means a very sensitive correlation between these two quantities .",
    "the right balance may require a correlated study of the two by keeping the ratio above @xmath82 .",
    "this constrain may guide future experiments on elastic and inelastic diffraction . for detailed details",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the model relies on the following premises :    \\1 . *",
    "regge factorization * is feasible since , as stressed repeatedly , at the lhc energies in the region of @xmath83  gev@xmath26 , which is typical for diffraction , the contribution from secondary reggeons is negligible , and , for a single pomeron term , factorization ( [ factor1 ] ) is exact . due to factorization , the relevant expressions for the cross sections ( elastic , sd , dd ) have simple forms ( [ elastic ] ) , ( [ sd ] ) , ( [ dd ] ) .",
    "such relations are known from the literature , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the inelastic @xmath84 vertex * receives special care .",
    "having justified and accepted the factorized form of the scattering amplitude , the main object of our study is now the inelastic proton - pomeron vertex or transition amplitude . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , it can be treated as the proton structure function ( sf ) , probed by the pomeron , and proportional to the pomeron - proton total cross section , @xmath85 with the norm @xmath86 in analogy with the proton sf probed by a photon ( in @xmath87 scattering e.g. at hera or jlab ) .",
    "@xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fine structure constant , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the bjorken variable .",
    "the only difference is that the pomeron s ( positive ) @xmath8 parity is opposite to that of the photon .",
    "this difference is evident in the values of the parameters but is unlikely to affect the functional form of the sf itself , for which we choose its high-@xmath92 ( low bjorken @xmath93 ) behavior .",
    "notice that the the total energy in this subprocess , the analogy of @xmath94 in dis , here is @xmath95 and @xmath12 here replaces @xmath96 of dis .",
    "notice that gauge invariance requires that the sf vanishes towards @xmath97 ( here , @xmath12 ) , resulting in the dramatic vanishing of the sd and dd differential cross section towards @xmath98 how fast does the sf ( and relevant cross sections ) recover from @xmath99 a priori is not known .     transition . ]    furthermore , according to the ideas of two - component duality , see e.g. @xcite , the cross sections of any process , including that of @xmath100 is a sum of a non - diffraction component , in which resonances sum up in high - energy ( here : mass @xmath5 plays the role of energy @xmath38 ) regge exchanges and the smooth background ( below the resonances ) , dual to the pomeron exchange .",
    "the dual properties of diffraction dissociation can be quantified also by finite mass sum rules , see @xcite . in short : the high - mass behavior of the @xmath101 cross section is a sum of a decreasing term going like @xmath102,@xmath103 and a `` pomeron exchange '' increasing slowly with mass .",
    "all this has little affect on the low - mass behavior at the lhc , however normalization implies calculation of cross sections integrated over all physical values of @xmath5 , i.e. until @xmath104 .",
    "the background * is a delicate issue . in the reactions ( sd , dd ) under consideration",
    "there are two sources of the background .",
    "the first is that related to the @xmath12 channel exchange in fig [ fig:2sd.fermilab](b ) and it can be accounted for by rescaling the parameter @xmath62 in the denominator of the pomeron propagator . in any case , at high energies , those of the lhc , this background is included automatically in the pomeron .",
    "the second component of background comes from the subprocesses @xmath101 .",
    "its high - mass behavior is not known experimentally and it can be only conjecture on the bases of the known energy dependence of the typical meson - baryon processes appended by the ideas of duality .",
    "the conclusion is that the @xmath9 total cross section at high energies ( here : missing masses @xmath50 ) has two components : a decreasing one , dual to direct - channel resonances and going as @xmath105 where @xmath106 are non - leading reggeons , and a slowly rising pomeron term producing @xmath107 @xcite .      any meson - baryon total cross section ( or scattering amplitude ) is a sum of two contributions : diffractive and non - diffractive . by the concept of two - component duality @xcite , the diffractive component ,",
    "the smooth background at low energies ( here : missing masses ) is dual to a pomeron @xmath12-channel exchange at high energies , while the non - diffractive component contains direct channel resonances , dual to high - energy @xmath42 channel ( sub - leading ) reggeon exchanges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regge - dual ] .        according to our present knowledge about two - body hadronic reactions , two distinct classes of reaction mechanisms exist .",
    "the first one includes the formation of resonances in the @xmath108channel and the exchange of particles , resonances , or regge trajectories in the @xmath42channel .",
    "the low - energy resonance behavior and the high - energy regge asymptotics are related by duality , which at born level , or , alternatively , for tree diagrams , mathematically can be formalized in the veneziano model , which is a combination of euler beta - functions @xcite .",
    "the second class of mechanisms does not exhibit resonances at low energies and its high - energy behavior is governed by the exchange of a vacuum regge trajectory , the pomeron , with an intercept equal to or slightly greater than one .",
    "harari and rosner @xcite hypothesized that the low - energy non - resonating background is dual to the high - energy pomeron exchange , or diffraction .",
    "in other words , the low energy background should extrapolate to high - energy diffraction in the same way as the sum of narrow resonances sum up to produce regge behaviour .",
    "however , contrary to the case of narrow resonances , the veneziano amplitude , by construction , can not be applied to ( infinitely ) broad resonances .",
    "this becomes possible in a generalization of narrow resonance dual models called dual amplitudes with mandelstam analyticity ( dama ) , allowing for ( infinitely ) broad resonances , see @xcite and references therein , or the background .    in the resonance region ,",

    "below is a brief summary of our results :    * at the lhc , in the diffraction cone region ( @xmath165  gev@xmath26 ) proton - proton scattering is dominated ( over @xmath166 ) by pomeron exchange ( quantified in ref .",
    "this enables full use of factorized regge - pole models .",
    "contributions from non - leading ( secondary ) trajectories can ( and should be ) included in the extension of the model to low energies , e.g. below those of the sps .",
    "* unlike to the most of the approaches which use the triple regge limit for construction of inclusive diffraction , our approaches based on the assumed similarity between the pomeron - proton and virtual photon - proton scattering . the proton structure function ( sf ) probed by the pomeron is the central object of our studies .",
    "this sf , similar to the dis sf , is exhibits direct - channel ( i.e. missing mass , @xmath50 ) resonances transformed in resonances in single- double- and central diffraction dissociation .",
    "the high-@xmath50 behaviour of the sf ( or pomeron - proton cross section ) is regge - behaved and contains two components : one decreasing roughly like @xmath167 due to the exchange of a secondary reggeon ( not to be confused with the pomeron exchange in the @xmath12 channel ! ) .",
    "the latter dominates the large-@xmath50 part of the cross sections .",
    "its possible manifestation may be seen in the data see fig .",
    "[ add.sd](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the large-@xmath50 region is the border of diffraction , @xmath136 .",
    "* an important and intriguing prediction of the present model is the possible turn - down of the cross sections towards @xmath99 , see appendix .",
    "the forward direction can not be reached kinematically in sd or dd , moreover even the non - zero but small @xmath28 events are difficult to be reached , especially that they are masked by electromagnetic interactions ( although weaker than in elastic scattering , see ref .",
    "further studies , both theoretical and experimental , of this intriguing phenomena are of great importance . *",
    "the results of our calculations , that are mainly predictions for the lhc energies @xmath168 and @xmath169  tev , are collected in table [ tab : cs.predict ] sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . predicted values for integrated , within various limits of @xmath12 and/or @xmath5 , cross sections can be also found in that section .",
    "the quality of the fit is quantified by the relevant @xmath170 values . *",
    "the model has an important and interesting prediction , following from the gauge invariance of the structure functions ( @xmath9 production amplitudes ) , namely that the cross sections turn down at very small values of @xmath28 , probably accessible in the nearly forward direction of future measurements .",
    "this result was anticipated in ref .",
    "our approach in this paper is inclusive , ignoring e.g. the angular distribution of the produced particles from decaying resonances .",
    "all resonances , except roper , lie on the @xmath1 trajectory .",
    "any complete study of the final states should included also spin degrees of freedom , ignored in the present model . * for simplicity we used linear regge trajectories and exponential residue functions , thus limiting the applicability of our model to low and intermediate values of @xmath28 .",
    "its extension to larger @xmath28 is straightforward and promising .",
    "it may reveal new phenomena , such as the the possible dip - bump structure is sd and dd as well as the transition to hard scattering at large momenta transfers , although it should be remembered that diffraction ( coherence ) is limited ( independently ) both by @xmath12 and @xmath37 .",
