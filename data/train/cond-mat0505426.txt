    "the renormalization of the interaction in the cooper channel ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) can be obtained in a completely analogous way .",

    "the advantage of such a procedure is clear since it is not necessary to solve integral equations .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the coupling matrix evolves under the rg flow in different regimes since it provides an insight on how to solve the problem analytically in some asymptotic limits .",
    "the simplest case occurs when there are no phonons present ( as discussed in ref . ) where a full analytical solution is possible . for the case of @xmath92 , eq .",

    "we can clearly see from fig.[fig : weak ] that , as the rg develops , the matrix @xmath109 , which at the beginning of the rg has its largest elements along the diagonal , acquires a cross - like shape , at which point its largest matrix elements occur near the origin where the frequencies are very small .",
    "the region with largest matrix elements occurs within the dark circle of size @xmath119 around the origin .",
    "moreover , within this circle the matrix elements are essentially constant showing that there is very little frequency dependence if the frequencies are smaller than @xmath119 . hence , @xmath119 is the scale that separates high from low energy physics in the weak coupling regime .",
    "thus , the full frequency dependence of the phonon propagator is irrelevant and we can safely approximate : @xmath120 hence , from eq .",
    "( [ big_z ] ) we have @xmath121 which is independent of @xmath103 .    even tough the most divergent elements of the matrix @xmath109 are the ones at small frequencies , it is important to include all the matrix elements since the rg equation couples low and high frequency processes .",

    "the solution of ( [ eq_weak ] ) is given by the determinant equation : @xmath130 or equivalently , @xmath131 which is a transcendental equation for @xmath132 .",
    "the last equation can be rewritten in a more interesting form by defining @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the variable of the problem ( notice that @xmath135 where @xmath136 ) in order to get : @xmath137 h(1/x_c ) +   \\frac{1+\\lambda}{\\lambda } \\left[1/\\mu^ * + \\ln(1/x_c)\\right ] = 0 \\ , , \\label{trans_weak}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the renormalized electron - electron interaction at the scale of phonon energy @xmath119 .",
    "this is the anderson - morel potential@xcite , which emerges naturally from the solution to the rg flow .",
    "note that the renormalized interaction is really weakly dependent on the bare electron - electron interaction since as @xmath139 increases it saturates very fast at @xmath140 which is interaction independent .",
    "in fact , in ordinary superconductors @xmath141 varies little from material to material ( @xmath142 ) and this can be understood by the logarithmic dependence with the cut - off @xmath143 and the phonon frequency @xmath119 ( if we estimate @xmath144k while @xmath145k we get @xmath146 ) .    when @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) we can approximate @xmath149 and eq .",

    "fig . [ fig : strong ] shows the numerical results for the full solution of the rg flow for parameters in strong coupling .",
    "the form of the matrix @xmath102 is very different from the weak - coupling limit and the important scale separating the high and low energy physics is @xmath157 .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath158 the characteristic energy scale that separates high from low energy physics is @xmath119 . when @xmath156 we expect @xmath159 in which case @xmath119 is not the characteristic energy scale of the instability",
    ". instead we expect @xmath90 to act as the characteristic energy scale in separating the low and high energy physics .",
    "thus , it is natural to make the following _ ansatz _ : @xmath160 where @xmath123 is an unknown .",
    "since , as discussed previously , @xmath141 is bounded from above , the electron - electron interaction will play a minimal role in the problem and can be disregarded .    in this regime ( [ appr_1 ] ) becomes ( @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 but from ( [ big_z ] ) we have @xmath163 , which substituted in ( [ eq_strong_1 ] ) gives @xmath164 the strong coupling result of eliashberg equation found by allen and dynes @xcite .",
    "we have numerically solved the rg equations for the flow of the bcs coupling matrix for interacting electrons coupled to phonons , for the case of circular fermi surface and einstein phonons .",
    "[ fig : lamc ] shows the result for the energy scale of divergence in the cooper channel , for a range of @xmath165 , and the expected analytical result at weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "one can clearly see that the approximate analytical solutions , based on the evolution of the coupling matrix under the rg , give a very good description of the superconducting gap in the asymptotic limits .",
