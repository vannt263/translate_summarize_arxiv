    "one of the main challenges for redshift confirmation in _ z _ @xmath9 6 galaxy candidates is the increasing attenuation of ly@xmath10 emission due to a rising intergalactic medium ( igm ) neutral fraction in the end of the reionization epoch @xcite . as a result ,",

    "our photometric results suggest that the ciii ] emission may be moderate in a relatively high luminosity lae sample at @xmath12 = 5.7 , with galaxy magnitudes ranging from @xmath11 -20.48 to -22.17 .",
    "targeting on galaxies with fainter intrinsic luminosities is needed in future for understanding the rest - frame uv / optical emission lines in galaxies in or at the end of the re - ionization epoch .",
