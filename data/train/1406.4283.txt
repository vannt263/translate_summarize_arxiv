    "in qcd in addition to the ultra - violet ( uv ) singularities also mass singularities appear .",
    "mass singularities can be further divided into infra - red ( ir ) and collinear ones . by analogy with the uv divergences , which rule the evolution of the strong coupling constant @xmath1",
    ", the collinear divergences rule the evolution of parton distribution functions , @xmath2 .",
    "this evolution is governed by the dglap equations @xcite which read : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the factorization scale , @xmath5 goes over all types of partons , and @xmath6 are the dglap splitting functions ( evolution kernels ) .    as opposed to parton distributions ,",
    "the evolution kernels can be calculated perturbatively and we can write their expansion in powers of @xmath1 as @xmath7 the lowest @xmath8 splitting functions @xmath9 are known for about forty years , e.g.  see @xcite .",
    "later , the @xmath10 splitting functions were calculated with the help of two independent methods : 1 ) the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite and 2 ) the method of curci , furmanski , and petronzio ( cfp ) @xcite which is based on factorization properties of mass singularities in the light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "the latest , state - of - the - art results for the @xmath11 space - like splitting functions were obtained with ope approach in @xcite , and approximate results for the @xmath11 time - like splitting functions are available in @xcite .",
    "such impressive results obtained with the ope method are caused by its technical simplicity compared to the cfp approach .",
    "the latter method operates in the physical momentum space and uses light - cone gauge which introduces additional complications due to the axial - type denominator @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a light - cone reference vector . despite of this complication",
    ", the cfp method provides a more clear physical picture of the collinear limit , i.e. generalized ladder expansion @xcite .",
    "this fact is used to build the first fully next - to - leading - order ( i.e. @xmath10 ) parton shower monte carlo generator @xcite ( with nlo corrections included in both the hard matrix element and the shower itself ) .",
    "construction of such a nlo shower , however , requires the knowledge about the @xmath10 splitting functions at the exclusive , unintegrated , level .",
    "it means that , in addition to the known dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath14 , the dependence on the transverse momentum variable should be also known .",
    "because of this , the use of the ope method becomes more complicated in comparison to the cfp approach .",
    "moreover , the @xmath10 splitting functions calculated in the standard cfp approach , that are available in the literature  @xcite , are also not well suited for the purpose of monte carlo simulations of parton cascades .",
    "first , the literature provides mostly the inclusive splitting functions ( after integration over the final state momenta ) .",
    "second , in the classic cfp approach there are cancellations between real and virtual contributions that are realized through cancellation of dimensional @xmath15 poles .",
    "this is incompatible with the monte carlo parton shower algorithms , and motivates modification of the cfp prescription  @xcite and recalculation of the @xmath10 evolution kernels .",
    "we already started to calculate the nlo dglap kernels in the modified scheme .",
    "for the first time the new approach was used to calculate the real contributions to the non - singlet splitting function @xcite .",
    "after that , we proceed with one - loop virtual contributions @xcite and would like to report on these results in this paper .",
    "contributions to the nlo splitting functions for @xmath0 come from two types of topologies , further referred to as _",
    "real _  with two final - state momenta ; and _ virtual _  with one virtual and one final - state momentum . at the inclusive level",
    "these two cases can be added together since all , real and virtual , momenta are integrated out and only @xmath14-dependence is left . with more detailed analysis of the standard calculation procedure @xcite one can find that @xmath16 terms cancel between these two contributions , while , as expected , terms @xmath17 and lower survive",
    ". existence of @xmath16 poles is a serious problem for monte - carlo application of splitting functions , since at the exclusive level the real and virtual contributions are defined in different phase spaces , two- and one - particle ones respectively .",
    "therefore , the contributions can not be easily added in order to cancel higher - order poles in @xmath18 and to make splitting functions finite in @xmath19 limit at the exclusive level . fortunately",
    ", this issue can be resolved with a modification to the standard pv regularization prescription for the light - cone singularities , which we proposed in @xcite .    in the standard approach",
    "the pv regularization is applied only to the axial denominator in the gluon propagator at the level of the feynman rules : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an infinitesimal regulator and @xmath22 is an external reference momentum .",
    "however , there are also singularities in the @xmath23 variable originating from the phase space parametrization or the feynman part of gluon propagator and in the standard approach these are regularized in a dimensional manner . in the _ new principal value _ ( npv ) prescription  @xcite the pv regularization",
    "is used to regularize _ all _ the singularities in the @xmath24 variable , regardless of their origin .",
    "for instance , we do the following replacement : @xmath25 in the entire integrand .",
    "when the new prescription is used , there is one technical point we would like to underline . as opposed to the standard techniques of calculating loop integrals , where we introduce e.g.  the feynman parameters and integrate over them at the very end of the calculation , in the npv prescription we perform the integration over the  plus \" component ( @xmath26 ) as the last one .    in the npv prescription singularities appearing as double @xmath15 poles ( before integration over scale , or in the case of virtual graphs before integration over final state momentum )",
    "are changed to double logarithms in the regulator @xmath21 or combination of single logarithms and single poles . ] ] for example , if we consider a three - point feynman integral ( kinematical set - up : @xmath27 ) in the standard cfp approach , we have : @xmath28 and in the npv prescription it is given by : @xmath29 in this example we can explicitly see how the @xmath15 pole is replaced by the geometrical regulator which can be actually implemented in a monte carlo program .",
    "it is also important that in most cases the singularities regularized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 cancel separately between the real and virtual contributions .",
    "in this section , we present a few selected results obtained in the npv scheme .",
    "namely , we show all contributions to the inclusive splitting function @xmath32 and selected contributions to the @xmath33 one .",
    "this is enough to demonstrate explicitly that the npv prescription leads to the same inclusive splitting functions as the standard pv scheme , but at the same time can be used at the exclusive level for monte carlo simulations in four dimensions .",
    "all the contributing graphs are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .    _",
    "inclusive splitting functions _ are presented in tables  [ tb:1][tb:2 ] , where in the ` virt ' column we provide contributions with one cut line , in the ` real ' column  with two cut lines , and in ` sum ' column  their sum .",
    "this allows for comparison of the results in npv prescription with already known results in the pv prescription @xcite and demonstrates the correctness of the proposed approach .",
    "the results in the ` virt ' columns can be calculated with the help of the axiloop package @xcite and are available in @xcite , the real contributions were calculated in @xcite . the column ` sum ' equals to the sum of the corresponding ` virt ' and ` real ' columns and is in full agreement with the known results , e.g. @xcite .     &",
