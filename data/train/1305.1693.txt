    "a variation of a classical external parameter of a quantum system offers a way to manipulate quantum states . almost since the dawn of the quantum theory , it has been recognized that the slow variation of the parameter ensures the adiabatic time evolution , where the quantum state can be pinned to an eigenspace of system s hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "later , the concept of quantum holonomy has been developed for adiabatic cycles on quantum systems . among them , the phase holonomy , where an adiabatic cycle induces a nontrivial change in the phase of a quantum state  @xcite , is a textbook result nowadays  @xcite .",
    "recently , the quantum holonomy of exotic kind has been recognized in that an adiabatic cycle can induce changes both in the eigenvalue and the eigenspace of a stationary state  @xcite .",
    "such changes are also referred to as eigenenergy and eigenspace anholonomies  @xcite .",
    "spectral degeneracies are crucial for the quantum holonomy . the phase holonomy is associated with a spectral degeneracy point , where a structure mathematically identical to the magnetic monopole resides , in the parameter space  @xcite . as for the exotic quantum holonomy",
    ", it is shown , for a quantum kicked spin-@xmath0 , that degenerate points in the complexified parameter space play the central role  @xcite .",
    "such a non - hermitian degeneracy point is known as an exceptional point  @xcite .",
    "there have been considerable number of recent works on exceptional points in non - hermitian quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that the exceptional points govern the exotic quantum holonomy in general , once we accept the view that the anholonomies in eigenenergy and eigenspace are a manifestation of multiple - valuedness of the solution of the eigenvalue problem in the parameter space .",
    "we remind the readers that an eigenvalue equation of a hamiltonian can be cast into an algebraic equation .",
    "hence its multiple - valued solutions form a family , and the family coalesces at a branch point in the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the encirclement of the branch point induces the permutation of the eigenvalues and eigenspaces in the family , which is to be identified as the complex - analytic origin of the exotic quantum holonomy .",
    "this , however , is rather unexpected scenario , because the exceptional points emerge only when the hamiltonian is far from hermitian , in spite of the fact that the exotic quantum holonomy is induced by an adiabatic hermitian cycle .",
    "hence the question is whether a family of hermitian hamiltonians that define an adiabatic cycle really `` encloses '' exceptional points .    the aim of this manuscript is to offer another example of successful `` exceptional point picture '' for the exotic quantum holonomy , in quantum many - body systems .",
    "we examine the lieb - liniger model , which describes bose particles confined in a one - dimensional space subject to the periodic boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "ushveridze showed that a non - hermitian extension of this model has an infinite number of exceptional points  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is shown that the lieb - liniger model exhibits the eigenenergy and eigenspace anholonomies  @xcite .",
    "hence , our purpose is to explain how the non - hermitian degeneracies of this model and the exotic quantum holonomy that occurs in hermitian hamiltonian is interrelated .",

    "first , we compare the present result with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correspondence between the exotic quantum holonomy and exceptional points is examined in families of quantum kicked spin-@xmath0 .",

    "second , it is certain that we should see whether the present observations apply to lieb - liniger model with an arbitrary number of particles , as we focus on the two - body case .",
    "we may expect that a similar scenario on the interplay of the exotic quantum holonomy and the exceptional points can be applicable .",
    "for example , according to the strong coupling expansion explained in section  [ sec : wavenumber ] , the degree of exceptional points is @xmath142 and each exceptional point connects the ground state and an excited state , regardless of the number of particles  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , however , there remain subtle points .",
    "for example , as for two - body case , the repetitions of the adiabatic cycle @xmath39 and its inverse connect all eigenstates once we specify the total momentum .",

    ", a family corresponds to a riemann surface of eigenenergy .",
    "the analytic continuation of the interaction strength @xmath2 can connect any pair of eigenstates in a family .",
    "however , as discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is an infinite number of families in three - body lieb - liniger model . for now , whether or not a family corresponds to a riemann surface of eigenenergy is unknown , because several families might be connected in a region far from the real axis of a riemann surface . in other words ,",
    "the question is open as to whether there is any exceptional point that is `` inaccessible '' by the real cycles .",
    "suppose that there is no such inaccessible exceptional point .",
    "this implies one - to - one correspondence between a family and a riemann surface .",
    "although this might suggest that the exceptional point picture obtained for the two body case is applicable to an arbitrary number of particles , another question is raised .",
    "there is only a single riemann surface for a given total momentum when the number of particles is two .",
    "the number of riemann surfaces , however , is infinite for the number of particle is three .",
    "we do not know how such a proliferation of riemann surfaces against the increment of the number of particles is possible .",
    "we have shown the direct link between the exotic quantum holonomy in eigenenergies and eigenspaces , and the exceptional points , which are degeneracy points in the complexified parameter space in two - body lieb - liniger model . with the help of bethe ansatz",
    ", we examine the riemann surface of quasi - momentum .",
    "all exceptional points in the lower half plane participate the eigenenergy anholonomy .",
    "also the non - abelian gauge connection introduced for the eigenspace anholonomy exhibits divergent behavior around the exceptional point as well as tiny multiple - valuedness correction .",
    "the exceptional points offer building blocks of the eigenspace anholonomy .",
    "it remains to be seen how the current result is to be extended to systems with an arbitrary number of particles .",
