    "for the planar case , we indeed prove a much stronger theorem : we show that if 4 firefighters are available at the first step , and 3 firefighters at each subsequent step , then the surviving rate of every planar graph is bounded by a positive constant .",
    "the main idea of the two proofs is to partition the vertices of a graph @xmath0 into two carefully chosen sets @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",

    "the proofs in sections  [ sec : pla ] and  [ sec : bip ] are more involved and use the well - known discharging method for planar graphs .",

    "it follows that a vertex  @xmath7 of degree  2 satisfies @xmath193 .",

    "since @xmath7 gives at most @xmath209 according to ( s5 ) , we have @xmath218 .    for a vertex @xmath79",
    ", we have by claim  [ cl:6 ] that it gives at most five times a charge according to  ( s2 ) .",

    "we can estimate , using claim  [ cl:7 ] and the observations above : @xmath225    we now estimate how often a face @xmath149 can give a charge  @xmath87 according to  ( s5 ) .",
    "this is at most the number of paths of length at most  6 , starting at a vertex @xmath10 of degree 4 incident with  @xmath149 , and whose internal vertices ( and faces incident with them ) all have degree exactly  4 .",

    "[ obs:3 ] , a face @xmath149 has at most @xmath228 vertices of @xmath45 on its boundary .",

    "this gives @xmath234 .",
    "so the surviving rate of a graph on @xmath124 vertices with this strategy is at least @xmath235 so if @xmath236 , the surviving rate is at least 1/723636 . on the other hand , if @xmath237 , then we still can save at least @xmath238 vertices , hence the surviving rate in that case is still at least @xmath239 .",
    "again , we have made no attempts to optimise the constants , in order to concentrate on making the exposition as clear as possible .",

    "theorem  [ th : bip ] together with the graph @xmath130 imply theorem  [ th : total](2 ) .",
    "regarding the firefighter number of planar graphs , we conjecture the following .      we believe that the proof of theorem  [ th : pla ] can be modified to prove that for some @xmath4 , every planar graph @xmath0 satisfies @xmath241 , which would give @xmath242 .",
    "the only difference with our setting is that only three firefighters are available at the first round ( instead of four ) .",
    "the main consequence is that not only @xmath43 is not empty , but also the structure of  @xmath88 is more complicated .",
    "however , the argument concerning @xmath78 will run smoothly using a strategy of fogarty  @xcite in hexagonal grids .",
    "nevertheless , we feel the proof technique is too local to lead to a proof of @xmath240 .",
    "for instance , the fact that only a constant number of steps are considered does not allow to design a good strategy ( saving a linear number of vertices in average ) with two firefighters in a very large hexagonal grid .",

    "@xcite proved that @xmath243 .",
    "the ideas of the proof of theorem  [ th : bip ] can be adapted to prove that @xmath244 , since it is not hard to show that a worst case scenario in this case is if locally , every face close to the firestart has size 8 , and around the boundary of these faces the vertices alternatingly have degree  2 and  4 .",
    "( in other words , locally the graph looks like a subdivided rectangular grid . ) in this case , a strategy similar to the strategy of fogarty described in section  [ sec : bip ] will save at least @xmath245 vertices .",
    "we omit details here , since we believe that such a result would still be far from optimal .",
    "indeed , we conjecture the following .",
    "we finish with a remark on the connection between separators and firefighters . for some constant @xmath4 , an _ @xmath247-separator _",
    "@xmath248 in a connected graph @xmath0 is a set of vertices whose removal yields at least two components of size at least @xmath249 .",
    "if for @xmath249 vertices @xmath7 of  @xmath0 , there is an @xmath247-separator @xmath250 whose cardinality is at most the distance between @xmath7 and  @xmath250 , then @xmath251 : by the time a fire starting at @xmath7 reaches @xmath250 , the single firefighter can protect all the vertices of @xmath250 , so a ( linear - sized ) component of @xmath252 not containing @xmath7 will be saved .",
