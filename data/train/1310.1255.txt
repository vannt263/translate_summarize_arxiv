    "a contact line occurs where solid , a liquid and gas ( or another immiscible liquid ) meet .",
    "when the solid is in motion and the liquid - gas interface is static , such as in coating processes , or when the solid is static and the liquid - gas interface moves , such as when droplets spread under capillary forces , the contact line is in motion , and differing merely through the choice of reference frame .",
    "moving contact lines are an important feature of a vast range of both natural and technological processes , and as such modelling and understanding of their behaviour is crucial to describe phenomena as disparate as insects walking on water to oil recovery and inkjet printing .",
    "moving contact lines are also of considerable interest from the fundamental point of view .",
    "the _ moving contact line problem _ remains a persistent long - standing problem in the field of fluid dynamics , despite its apparent conceptual simplicity ( see _ e.g. _  review articles by dussan v.,@xcite de gennes,@xcite blake,@xcite and bonn _",
    "the problem occurs as the static interface , modelled classically as a sharp transition between liquid and gas , and the moving solid surface , modelled with no - slip , cause an obvious multi - valued behaviour in the velocity.@xcite this was highlighted in the celebrated analysis of huh and scriven@xcite a number of decades ago , encapsulating the moving contact line problem as the problem of a _ non - integrable stress singularity _ through analysing a planar liquid- fluid interface meeting a solid , and showing the nonphysical prediction that an infinite force would be required , if the classical model held , to submerge a solid object .    in their concluding remarks ,",
    "huh and scriven eloquently describe the failures and omissions of the classical continuum mechanical model , many of which have been fruitful areas of research in the subsequent years .",
    "the obvious culprit for the unphysical singularities was first suggested to be the no - slip condition at the wall . to resolve the problem some form of slip in the contact line vicinity",
    "may be allowed , with navier - slip , written down in the early 19th century by navier,@xcite being proposed by huh and scriven.@xcite the introduction of slip was not , however , proposed by the authors as a physical effect , but rather that it would alleviate the mathematical singularities with the boundary condition serving to parametrize a number of microscale ingredients missing in the classical model in a concise and amenable fashion .",
    "the range of microscale ingredients suggested include the possibility of cavitation at the contact line , gradients in viscosity and density  and appreciable compressibility effects , non - newtonian effects , the role of surfactants or heat accumulation , and long - range intermolecular forces , which are often associated with the existence of a precursor film model ahead of the macroscopic liquid - fluid front ( a comparison between slip and precursor film models was undertaken in ref .  ) .",
    "the focus of this work is to consider a moving solid - liquid - gas contact line but with the interface between liquid and gas to be diffuse .",
    "diffuse - interface models , reviewed _",
    "e.g. _  by anderson , mcfadden , and wheeler,@xcite have been around for a number of years , but have been growing in popularity to consider the contact line since the crucial works of seppecher@xcite for liquid - gas systems , and jacqmin@xcite for binary fluids .",
    "the seminal study of seppecher , in particular , will provide the foundation for the governing equations considered here , however there are a number of important deficiencies ( further discussion of which are in sec .",
    "[ sec : seppecher ] ) and areas to extend .",
    "primarily , seppecher s work is often referred to when suggesting that diffuse - interface models resolve the moving contact line problem .",
    "whilst the work by seppecher certainly contains some discussion of the asymptotics , the analysis was somewhat incomplete , with asymptotic regions being probed without careful justification and the crucial behaviour close to the contact line only investigated numerically .",
    "a number of ( unnecessary ) constraints were also imposed _",
    "e.g. _  imposing a 90@xmath0 contact angle and considering the two fluids , _",
    "i.e. _  the liquid and gas , to have equal viscosity .",
    "full numerical computations for the liquid - gas problem have been undertaken , such as by briant@xcite and briant , wagner and yeomans,@xcite using lattice - boltzmann methods .",
    "computations for diffuse - interface models for binary fluids ( _ i.e. _  for solid - liquid - liquid contact line problems ) have also been reported by a number of authors ; this is a different situation , however , often modelled as two incompressible fluids , and including a coupled cahn ",
    "hilliard equation ( with an extra nondimensional number , the mobility ) to account for the diffusion between the two fluid components and evolve this effective order parameter.@xcite    here , we examine analytically a diffuse - interface model without slip , a precursor film , or any other ingredients .",
    "the classical model considers the fluid - fluid interface to be a sharp surface of zero thickness where quantities such as the fluid density are , in general , discontinuous .",
    "the diffuse - interface approach relaxes this , in line with the physics of the problem and in agreement with developments and applications in the field of statistical mechanics of liquids and in molecular simulations , with quantities varying smoothly but rapidly ( _ e.g. _  see refs .  ) , and considers the interface to have a non - zero thickness , say @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _  a mesoscopic or effective lengthscale ( `` mean field '' ) which is not known a priori .",
    "in reality , this is of the order of the molecular scale , @xmath2 , as also predicted by statistical mechanics and molecular simulations , but diffuse - interface models do not involve any molecular description . nevertheless , @xmath3 giving the required separation of scales and justifying the use of continuum equations for these models . to recover the usual hydrodynamic equations and boundary conditions ,",
    "one then takes the sharp - interface limit , @xmath4 . in the context of moving contact line problems ,",
    "the sharp - interface limit has been considered carefully in analytical works with simple phase - field models , and in numerical studies of phase - field , liquid - gas , and binary fluid diffuse - interface models _",
    "_  refs .  .",
    "despite their success in describing several fluid flow problems , diffuse - interface models are not free of controversy .",
    "recent debate in a special issue of the european physical journal - special topics,@xcite has prompted questions , principally from the founder of one of the more complex continuum mechanical models applied to contact line motion ",
    "the interface formation model of shikhmurzaev,@xcite in discussion articles , refs .  .",
    "his views were countered by a number of authors , in refs .  .",
    "the special issue was concluded by blake,@xcite who proposed a more collaborative stance towards modelling the moving contact line , including understanding of it from the viewpoint of diffuse - interface models .",
    "it is clear that diffuse - interface models are of current interest and are increasingly being successfully applied by many authors in a wide variety of settings , thus analysis to further their theoretical understanding is much needed .",
    "the fluid density @xmath5 acts as an order parameter in this liquid - gas diffuse - interface setting , such that in the sharp - interface limit ( _ i.e. _  as the thickness of the interface , @xmath6 , tends to zero ) the two bulk fluids satisfy @xmath7 and @xmath8 , being liquid and vapour respectively , where we consider the behaviour of the system with vapour phase of negligible density ( as _ e.g. _  in ref .  ) .",
    "the liquid - gas interface may then be defined as the location where @xmath9 , although other choices such as defining it as the location of the gibbs dividing interface would be possible . in this study , we also allow for general terms in the free energy and for the density dependence of the viscosities , so that equal and disparate bulk viscosities are encompassed . a simpler setting",
    "was considered in ref .  , where both viscosity and free energy forms were specified , to elucidate the alleviation of the singularities associated with the classical modelling of contact line motion by the diffuse - interface model , and to provide a basis upon which to compare this approach to the aforementioned interface formation model of shikhmurzaev.@xcite these simpler forms will be referred to where appropriate , throughout this article .",
