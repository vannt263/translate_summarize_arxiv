    "semiflexible polymers such as filamentous proteins resemble elastic rods on a molecular scale , while exhibiting significant thermal fluctuations on the scale of micrometers or even less .",
    "this has made them useful as model systems allowing for direct visualization via optical microscopy .",
    "but , semiflexible polymers are not just large versions of their more well - studied flexible cousins such as polystyrene .",
    "filamentous proteins , in particular , have been shown to exhibit _ qualitatively _ different behavior in their networks and solutions .",
    "a fundamental reason for this is the fact that the thermal _ persistence length _ , a measure of filament stiffness as the length at which thermal bending fluctuations become apparent , can become large compared with other important length scales such as the spacing between polymers in solutions , or the distance between chemical crosslinks in a network .",
    "one of the most studied semiflexible polymers in recent years has been f - actin , a filamentous protein that plays a key structural role in cells @xcite .",
    "these occur in combination with a wide range of specific proteins for crosslinking , bundling and force generation in cells .",
    "these composites , together with other filamentous proteins such as microtubules , constitute the so - called _ cytoskeleton _ that gives cells both mechanical integrity and structure . this biopolymer gel is but one example of a large class of polymeric materials that can store elastic energy in a combination of bending and extensional deformations of the constituent elements .",
    "such systems can be called semiflexible gels or networks .",
    "one of the important lessons from recent experimental and theoretical studies is that the shear modulus of cross - linked semiflexible networks bears a much more complex relationship to the mechanical properties of the constituent filaments and to the microstructure of the gel than is the case for flexible polymer gels @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that semiflexible gels exhibit a striking cross - over @xcite between a response to external shear stress that is characterized by a spatially heterogeneous strain ( a _ non - affine _ regime @xcite ) and a uniform strain response ( an _ affine _ regime @xcite ) .",
    "this crossover is governed primarily by cross - link density and molecular weight ( filament length ) .",
    "the bulk shear modulus of the network simultaneously increases by about six orders of magnitude at this nonaffine - to - affine cross - over .",
    "the underlying mechanism responsible for this abrupt cross - over appears to be the introduction of a new , mesoscopic length scale in the problem that is related to both the bending stiffness of the constituent polymers and the mean spacing between consecutive cross - links along the chain @xcite .",
    "one can associate this mesoscopic length with the length below which the deformation of the network departs from the standard affinity .",
    "the nonaffinity length @xmath0 , introduced in refs.@xcite , can be qualitatively understood as the typical length over which one finds nonaffine deformation in the network . in this previous work we presented a scaling analysis that relates this mesoscopic length scale to the network density and the stretching and bending moduli of the constituent filaments .",
    "the macroscopic shear response of the network is then controlled by a competition between @xmath0 ( the nonaffinity length ) and the filament length , @xmath1 . on the one hand , when the filament length is long , nonaffine corrections to the deformation field , which are localized to regions within @xmath0 of the filament ends ,",
    "do not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the network ; the shear modulus of the macroscopic system is well - described by calculations based on affine deformation reflecting the fact that nonaffine deformations of the filament ends are subdominant corrections in this limit . moreover ,",
    "the elastic energy is stored primarily in the ( homogeneous ) extension and compression of filaments . on the other hand , when the filaments are of a length comparable to , or shorter than the nonaffinity length , _ i.e. _ @xmath2 then the nonaffine deformations of the ends play a large , even dominant role in determining the mechanical properties of the network .",
    "the network is found to be generally more compliant , and the elastic energy under applied shear stress is stored in a spatially heterogeneous manner in the bending of filaments .",
    "the existence of these distinct regimes as a function of filament length reflects a fundamental difference of these semiflexible polymer networks with respect to their flexible counterparts : polymers can maintain their mechanical integrity and state of stress / strain across network nodes or crosslinks .",
    "these results naturally lead one to pose a number of basic questions regarding the elastic properties of semiflexible networks . while these random networks must on basic theoretical grounds appear as continuum , isotropic materials at the longest length scales , these considerations do not predict the length at which the continuum approximation applies . the previous identification of the nonaffinity length , @xmath0 as the only mesoscopic length associated with the nonaffine - to - affine cross - over in uniformly sheared semiflexible networks suggests that this length should more generally control the cross - over to continuum behavior @xcite .",
    "after all the affine deformation of the network under uniform stress at scales large compared to @xmath0 shows that in one case at least the nonaffinity length controls the cross - over to continuum behavior .",
    "one of the principal results of the present work is the demonstration that @xmath0 more generally controls this cross - over to continuum mechanics in semiflexible gel systems .",
    "prior work has focussed exclusively on simple shear and uniaxial extension . in order to better examine the universality of the previous results ,",
    "we study the opposite limit of a highly localized external force in the form of a point force monopole or dipole . if one can show that the elastic ( displacement ) green s function of the system similarly depends on only one additional parameter @xmath0 then it would appear that this quantity completes the coarse - grained elastic description of the system on all length scales down to the mean distance between cross - links .",
    "it may be , however , that the deformation field of these semiflexible networks is much more complex and the simplification introduced by @xmath0 in the description of the network s response to uniform shear strain can not be generalized to deformations resulting from more general forcing conditions .    while our results below , indeed , show that @xmath0 does largely control the crossover to ( the _ far field _ ) continuum elasticity , the observed elastic green s function is sensitive to the local structure of the network on length scales below @xmath0 .",
    "below we discuss how we quantify the structure of the green s function and its approach to the form required by continuum elasticity .",
    "the observed elastic green s function , however , depends not only on the @xmath0dependent lam coefficients of the material , but also on local properties of the displacement field immediately surrounding the the point force . in effect",
    "one may imagine that , upon the application of the point force , the network acts as a type of composite material : within a distance @xmath0 of the point force it deforms in a way not well described by continuum theories , while outside of that zone it does appear to act like an elastic continuum .",
    "the complete green s function depends , of course , on the material properties of both media .",
    "unfortunately , only one of those media ( the outer zone ) is well characterized by the simple continuum theory of an isotropic elastic solid , so the complete green s function remains complex and depends on the detailed network structure within the inner zone surrounding the applied force .",
    "there is another set of questions that may be addressed via the study of the network s response to point forces and force dipoles .",
    "such forces not only probe the material properties of the network in a manner complimentary to the uniform strains explored earlier , they also have direct physical implications for microrheology in f - actin networks and for the dynamics of the cytoskeleton in response to the activity of nanoscale molecular motors , _ e.g. _ myosin .",
    "fluctuation - based microrheology , an application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the study of rheology via the statistical analysis of the thermally fluctuating position of sub - micron tracer particles embedded in the medium , requires one to understand the elastic green s function of the medium .",
    "thus understanding the response of semiflexible networks to localized forces has direct experimental implications and consequences for force production in the cytoskeleton .    in the biological context , the semiflexible network making up the cytoskeleton is generally found in association with molecular motors that , to a good approximation , generate transient localized force dipoles in the material . to both",
    "understand force generation in the cell as well as the material properties of these cytoskeletal networks driven into nonequilibrium steady states by these molecular motors , one must determine the displacement field associated with such motor - induced forces .",
    "notwithstanding our biological motivation for this work , our findings also bear on the broader problem of elastic modes in amorphous materials .",
    "it has been shown that the vibrational modes of deep  quenched lennard ",
    "jones systems approach a continuum description only on scales exceeding some mesoscopic length  @xmath3  @xcite ; for the protocols considered , a value @xmath4 particle dimensions was robustly found .",
    "this was physically identified with a length scale for non  affinity , suggesting a direct correspondence with our  @xmath0 ( although our @xmath0 can be controlled by varying the mechanical properties of the constituents ) .",
    "a comparable length was also found to control the self  averaging of the green s function to the form expected by continuum elasticity  @xcite .",
    "these findings for radially interacting particles are broadly in keeping with our own investigations for semiflexible polymer networks .",
    "we also mention here that the relationship between continuum elasticity and the green s function has also been discussed for mildly disordered spring networks  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : model ] we develop our model of semiflexible , permanently cross - linked gels , summarize the numerical simulations used to study it , and discuss the expected structure of the displacement field when averaged over numerous realizations of the network . in section [ s : results ] we report our results for both point forces in [ ss : point - force ] and force dipoles in [ ss : dipole ] .",
    "we then discuss our studies of the bulk elastic properties of these networks in [ ss : bulk ] before concluding in section [ s : discussion ] .",
    "a highly successful continuum continuum model of individual semiflexible polymers is the _ worm  like chain_. this treats the linear filaments as elastic rods of fixed contour length and negligible thickness , so that the dominant contribution to the elastic energy comes from bending modes and the hamiltonian linearized to small deviations from a straight configuration that is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transverse displacement of the filament relative to an arbitrary straight axis , @xmath7 is its arc length , and the elastic modulus @xmath8 gives the bending energy per unit length @xmath9 .",
    "the longitudinal response of the wormlike chain model is calculated from the increase in free energy due to an extensional stress applied along the mean filament axis @xcite . however , the numerical algorithm used in our simulations is based on the minimization of the hamiltonian of the system , and hence is fundamentally athermal . the reason for this choice is essentially one of efficiency : assuming there are no subtle convergence issues , minimization is expected to be faster than stochastic modelling and , it is anticipated , give better statistics for a given cpu time .",
    "this does , however , mean that the entropic mechanism governing the longitudinal response is absent , and an explicit energetic term is required .",
    "an unconstrained filament at @xmath10 forms a straight configuration , and thus elongation of its end  to ",
    "end distance must be accompanied by a change in the absolute contour length .",
    "it is therefore natural to incorporate longitudinal modes by adding a second elastic term to the hamiltonian for the extension or shortening of the filament backbone , @xmath11 where @xmath12 gives the strain or relative change in local contour length , and @xmath13 is the young s modulus of the filament ( essentially a spring constant normalized to 1/[length ] ) .",
    "of course , such modes also exist in thermal systems , but may be dominated by the entropic spring terms @xcite , except possibly for very short filament segments or very densely cross - linked gels .",
    "the connection between thermal / entropic and athermal longitudinal compliance is discussed in greater detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two elastic coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath13 together define a length scale @xmath14 , which will shall refer to as the intrinsic _ bending length _ by observing that an isolated filament constrained to have different tangents at its end points will deform with this characteristic length . to avoid potential confusion , however , we note that this is _ not _ the typical length scale for bending deformations of a semiflexible filament . rather , the bending energy of filaments tends to make the longest unconstrained wavelength bending mode the dominant one .",
    "thus , for instance , in a crosslinked gel , filaments are expected to be bent primarily on a length comparable to the distance between crosslinks .",
    "nonetheless @xmath15 is a useful measure of filament rigidity , in that large @xmath15 corresponds to rigid filaments , and small @xmath15 to flexible ones .",
    "although @xmath8 and @xmath13 have been introduced as fundamental coefficients , if the filament is regarded as a continuous elastic body with uniform cross section at zero temperature , then they can both be expressed in terms of the characteristic filament radius @xmath16 and intrinsic bulk modulus @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 , and thinner filaments are more flexible than thick ones ( as measured by @xmath15 ) , as intuitively expected .",
    "given the possibility of entropic effects in @xmath13 , however , we shall treat these as independent parameters of the theory @xcite    the gel is constructed by depositing filaments of monodisperse length @xmath1 and zero thickness onto a two  dimensional substrate . the center  of  mass position vector and orientation of the filaments",
    "are uniformly distributed over the maximum allowed range , so the system is macroscopically isotropic and homogeneous . whenever two filaments overlap they are cross - linked at that point .",
    "deposition continues until the required mass density , as measured by the mean distance between crosslinks @xmath21 , has been reached .",
    "the network thus constructed can be described by three lengths : @xmath22 , and @xmath21 and one modulus scale : @xmath13 . in two - dimensions",
    "@xmath21 characterizes both the mass density and cross - link density in spatially random , isotropic networks .",
    "the length @xmath15 characterizes the mechanical properties of the constituent filaments via the ratio of their bending to stretching compliance .",
    "the overall modulus scale @xmath13 will be absorbed into the point forces applied to the network .",
    "previously @xcite , we identified an additional length @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . this _",
    "non  affinity length _ characterized the crossover from non  affine to affine network response .",
    "specifically , for filament lengths @xmath1 much larger than @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ , high molecular weight ) , the bulk network properties could be understood quantitatively in terms of affine strains , while significant non  affine effects were observed for @xmath25 .",
    "although this length arose naturally from considerations of bulk network properties @xcite , its dependence on @xmath21 and @xmath15 can be understood in terms of a balance of stretching / compression and bending energies of a single filament , treated in a self  consistent way within a network @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this ( material ) length is intermediate , between the ( geometric ) network length @xmath21 and the macroscopic scale .",
    "in fact , in dilute networks , for which @xmath26 , we shall argue below that the network can be thought of on scales @xmath27 as a quasi  continuum : continuous , as opposed to discrete , but not necessarily described by macroscopic continuum elasticity .",
    "we shall find that this non  affinity length will play a key role in our analysis of the displacement field on this intermediate / quasi  continuum scale .    in order to apply the point forces ,",
    "a crosslink is chosen at random and identified as the origin of the system ; it is this crosslink that will later be perturbed .",
    "a fixed circular boundary at radius @xmath28 from the origin is imposed , and any filaments or filament segments that extend beyond the boundary are simply removed or truncated , respectively .",
    "filaments ending on the rigid boundary are fixed there by another freely rotating bond as are found at all cross - links in the system .",
    "the allowed free rotation at the boundary means that the boundary supplies arbitrary constraint forces on the network but can not support any localized torques .",
    "details of the simulation method have been presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the procedure , with particular attention on those aspects that are central to the problems studied in this paper .",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath29 is constructed from discrete versions of ( [ e : h_wlc ] ) and ( [ e : h_hooke ] ) applied to the geometry generated by the random deposition procedure described above .",
    "the degrees of freedom @xmath30 , or ` nodes , ' are the position vectors of both crosslinks and midpoints between crosslinks , the latter so as to incorporate the first bending mode along the filament segments .",
    "additional nodes could be included at the cost of additional run time , but are expected to have a small effect , since the longest unconstrained wavelengths tend to dominate bending deformations .",
    "crosslinks are treated as constraints on the relative position of each connected filament segment , but not on their relative rotation .",
    "physically this corresponds to an inextensible but freely rotating linkage .",
    "as previously noted , constrained bending at crosslinks has a small effect except at high network concentrations ( specifically , when @xmath21 becomes comparable to @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "nodes on the boundary are immobile .",
    "note that , as in our earlier work  @xcite , the network is assumed to be initially unstressed on both macroscopic and microscopic length scales .",
    "there are two ways in which the system may be perturbed .",
    "the first , which we call _ monopole _ forcing , is to apply an arbitrarily small external force @xmath31 to the crosslink at the origin .",
    "the network is then allowed to relax to a new configuration consistent with mechanical force balance at every node .",
    "the second , which we call _ dipole _ forcing , is to introduce a geometrical defect into the system by moving the central crosslink along the contour length of one of the filaments to which it belongs , but not the other .",
    "physically , this corresponds , _",
    "e.g. _ , to a motor introducing relative motion of one filament with respect to another filament . in the simulations ,",
    "this effect is incorporated by infinitesimally ` shifting ' the image of the central node with respect to other nodes on one filament .",
    "once the perturbation has been specified , the displacements of the nodes in the new mechanical equilibrium are calculated by minimizing the system hamiltonian @xmath29 using the conjugate gradient method  @xcite .",
    "this generates a displacement field for the particular geometry under consideration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : eg_indiv_run ] .",
