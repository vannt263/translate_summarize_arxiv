    "such models have been considered in many other application areas as well , some examples include , chemical and biological systems ( e.g. biological aggregation , chemotactic response dynamics@xcite ) , mathematical finance ( e.g. mean field games@xcite , default clustering in large portfolios@xcite ) , social sciences ( e.g. opinion dynamics models @xcite ) , communication systems ( @xcite ) etc .",
    "starting from the work of sznitman@xcite there has been an extensive body of work that studies law of large number behavior ( propagation of chaos ) , central limit theory ( normal fluctuations from the mean ) and large deviation principles for such models .",
    "all of these results concern the behavior of the system over a finite time horizon .",
    "in many applications the time asymptotic behavior of the system is of central concern .",
    "for example , stability of a communication system , steady state aggregation and self organization in biological and chemical systems , long term consensus formation mechanisms in opinion dynamics modeling , particle based approximation methods for invariant measures all rely on a careful analysis of the time asymptotic behavior of such systems .",
    "such behavior for special families of weakly interacting particle systems has been considered by several authors . in @xcite",
    "the authors give general sufficient conditions for a family of discrete time systems for uniform in time exponential probability concentration estimates to hold .",
    "these conditions formulated in terms of dobrushin s coefficient are not very restrictive when the state space of the particles is compact , however they are hard to verify for settings with an unbounded state space . in @xcite a discrete time model with a compact state space for chemotactic cell response dynamics",
    "was studied .",
    "several time asymptotic results , including uniform in time law of large numbers , exponential stability of the associated nonlinear markov process and uniform in time convergence of a particle based simulation scheme , were established . for the setting of an unbounded state space and in continuous time , there have been several recent interesting works on granular media equations @xcite which establish uniform in time propagation of chaos , time uniform convergence of simulation schemes and uniform in time exponential concentration estimates .    in the current work we consider a discrete time weakly interacting particle system and the corresponding nonlinear markov process in @xmath0 , described in terms of a general stochastic evolution equation . denoting by @xmath9 the state of the @xmath10-th particle @xmath11 at time instant @xmath3 ,",
    "the evolution is given as @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the empirical measure of the particle values at time instant @xmath3 , @xmath14 is a @xmath15 matrix , @xmath16 is a small parameter , @xmath17 is an i.i.d array of @xmath18 valued random variables with common probability law @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a measurable function .",

    "our starting point is the evolution equation for the law of the nonlinear markov chain given in .",

    "we next argue in theorem [ th3 ] that under an additional integrability condition ( assumption [ assumd ] ) , as @xmath6 , the empirical measure @xmath2 of the @xmath1-particles at time @xmath3 converges to the law @xmath4 of the nonlinear markov process at time @xmath3 , in the w1 distance , in @xmath5 , _ uniformly _ in @xmath3 .",

    "this propagation of chaos property all the way to @xmath8 crucially relies on the uniform in time convergence of @xmath2 to @xmath32 .",
    "the next three results study the rate of this uniform convergence by developing suitable probability concentration estimates .",
    "the first result ( theorem [ th5 ] ) , under an assumption of polynomial moments on the initial data and noise sequence ( assumption [ assumd ] ) establishes a corresponding uniform in time polynomial concentration bound .",
    "the proof relies on an idea of restricting measures to a compact set and estimates on metric entropy introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is to first obtain a concentration bound for the @xmath38 distance between the truncated law and its corresponding empirical law in a compact ball of radius @xmath39 along with an estimate on the contribution from the region outside the ball and finally optimize suitably over @xmath39 .",
    "the last two results are concerned with exponential concentration .",
