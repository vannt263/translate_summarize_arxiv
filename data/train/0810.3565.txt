    "nonlinear effects induced by unabsorbed photons are known to be of high technological interest due to the timescale on which ultrashort laser pulses allow them to operate .",
    "a quite usual way to describe these optical effects is through non - linear susceptibilities [ 1 - 17 ] . since photons",
    "do not interact directly , these nonlinearities can only come from interactions between the matter excitations to which these unabsorbed photons are coupled . in the case of semiconductors ,",
    "these matter excitations can be conveniently seen as virtual excitons .",
    "interactions between excitons have two quite different origins : coulomb interaction between the carriers of these excitons , but also and mainly pauli exclusion between these carriers .",
    "this pauli exclusion remained for decades quite difficult to handle properly .",
    "this is why excitons have been commonly treated as elementary bosons with effective scatterings dressed by a certain amount of carrier exchanges [ 18,19 ] .    over the last few years",
    ", we have developed a many - body theory for composite bosons made of two fermions , like the excitons , which , as a main goal , has the exact treatment of fermion exchanges between composite bosons [ 20,21 ] .",
    "this theory , in a natural way , generates `` pauli scatterings '' which describe carrier exchanges between two excitons in the absence of carrier interactions . by combining these 2@xmath02 scatterings",
    ", it is actually possible to describe all carrier exchanges which can exist between @xmath1 excitons , these multiple exchanges being nicely visualized through the so - called `` shiva diagrams '' [ 21,22 ] .",
    "since these pauli scatterings are dimensionless by construction , they in fact control all optical nonlinearities when the detuning increases , due to a bare dimensional argument : coulomb scatterings associated to coulomb interaction between carriers are energylike quantities , so that when they appear , they must have energylike denominators which can only be photon detunings .",
    "this makes coulomb processes negligible in front of pure fermion exchanges when the detuning increases . and",
    "indeed , in essentially all nonlinear effects we have up to now studied [ 23 - 29 ] , coulomb interaction between excitons plays a minor role .",
    "we will see that this is also true in the present work , the dominant term in the final expression of the photoinduced current density , eqs.(5.1,2 ) , again being the pauli scattering term .",
    "textbooks usually give the third order response to a photon field as a third order integral over time of a triple commutator [ 1,8,13 ] .",
    "this algebraic expression , although nicely compact , immediately raises a major problem since , when developed , this triple commutator makes appear the hamiltonian acting on two - electron - hole - pair states . as the exact eigenstates of two electrons and two holes",
    "are not known except for highly simplified hamiltonians [ 5,11 ] , the exact calculation of these terms is not possible .",
    "it is however necessary to somehow control them since they contain volume linear contributions which have to be extracted in order to show that they cancel exactly , for nonlinear susceptibilities are intensive quantities .",
    "this `` cancellation problem '' , which remained open for decades [ 2 - 4 ] , has been successfully tackled recently [ 25,26 ] using the tools we have developed for interactions between composite excitons . in this framework ,",
    "the calculation of the third order susceptibility turns out to be rather simple because , in it , only enter two interacting excitons , not @xmath1 as in many other problems we can now address .",
    "the formal elimination of these volume linear terms relies on the possibility to , in an _ exact way _ , pass @xmath2 over an exciton creation operator .",
    "this `` trick '' , which is given in eq.(3.5 ) , turns out to be useful not only for calculating nonlinear susceptibilities but also for any problem involving time evolution of exciton states .",
    "once these volume linear terms are eleminated , we are left with an expression of the nonlinear response to a photon field which reads in terms of pauli scatterings for carrier exchanges between two excitons and coulomb scatterings for carrier interactions , as physically reasonable since nonlinear optical effects in semiconductors are expected to come from interactions between the virtual excitons to which photons are coupled .",
    "this result was reported in ref.[26 ] .",
    "a somewhat more detailed version can be found in ref.[25 ] .",
    "however , the procedure we first used to obtain it was rather heavy : we calculated explicitly the eight terms of the triple commutator and carefully combined all the volume linear terms to show that they exactly cancel . in writing the extended version of this work , we have realized that , by calculating the first of these commutators explicitly , we are trivially left with pauli and coulomb terms only , so that , by doing so , we immediately get rid of all the nasty volume linear terms .",
    "it is this far simpler derivation that we here report in details . in view of its formal simplicity",
    ", it becomes easy to consider a photon field with multifrequency , as necessary to possibly describe four - wave - mixing experiments in which different laser beams would be used . in this work",
    ", we however restrict to photons all having the same circular polarization .",
    "this allows us to drop the spin indices and makes all notations far lighter .",
    "extension to photons with different elliptical polarizations , in order to cover all possible configurations , will be given in a forthcoming paper , the goal of the present work being to concentrate on the fundamental aspects of the new procedure we propose .",
    "due to a bare dimensional argument , the dimensionless pauli scatterings can not appear in boson - exciton effective hamiltonians [ 18,19 ] whatever the bosonization procedure to generate them is .",
    "as these pauli scatterings control all optical nonlinear effects at large detunings , it is clear that it is not possible , through these effective hamiltonians , to properly describe optical nonlinearities in semiconductors , nor to derive the correct expression of nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "various groups [ 7,9,10,12 ] , through rather different procedures , have managed to tackle the third order susceptibility while keeping the exciton composite nature exactly . since in the third order susceptibility , only enters the interaction of two excitons , it is not necessary to have at hand a quite general @xmath1-body formalism to possibly solve this two - body problem exactly . in these works , the third order response to a photon field is usually approached not through the standard textbook expression for nonlinear susceptibilities , but through its time derivative .",
    "this turns out to be quite wise as the so - called cancellation problem , which immediately appears when writing this susceptibility through a triple commutator , is then totally avoided .",
    "comparison between the present approach and these various procedures , within the same set of notations in order to make an easy link between all of them , is clearly of interest as the obtained results can appear as rather different at first , even to a careful reader .",
    "however , this comparison , which implies to go into each of these different procedures rather in details , is definitely too long to be included here .",
    "this is why we will present it in an independent paper .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we settle the problem .    in section 3",
    ", we outline the difficulty the `` brute force '' calculation of the triple commutator raises and give the trick which allowed us to overcome it .    in section 4 ,",
    "we show how we can , within a few lines , get rid of all volume linear terms and immediately reach the physically relevant pauli and coulomb terms .",
    "we then show how to get a compact form for these two terms .    in section 5",
    ", we discuss the final result and give its representation in shiva diagrams .    in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude .",
    "this paper also contains two appendices . in the first one",
    ", we come back to the appropriate way to describe optical nonlinearities in solid state physics , to once more stress that , although seen in many semiconductor textbooks and publications , it is not the photoinduced dipole density but the photoinduced current density which has to be used in this description .",
    "the second appendix contains a compact rederivation from scratch of the formal expression of operator mean value at third order in coupling , for completeness .",
    "the standard way to approach optical nonlinearities is to calculate the time dependence of physically relevant operator mean values due to the wave function change induced by the coupling of the system at hand to a photon field , this field being introduced adiabatically from @xmath3 .",
    "as explained in appendix a , the relevant operator in solid state physics is not the dipole density @xmath4 as used in atomic physics , but the current density @xmath5 , because wave functions for solid state systems are not spatially localized as in the case of atoms but extended over the whole sample , due to crystal periodicity .",
    "since the relevant excitation operators for problems dealing with semiconductors are the exciton creation operators @xmath6 , i.e. , operators such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the semiconductor hamiltonian and @xmath9 the electron - hole vacuum , the interband contribution to the current density , which is a one - electron operator , can be conveniently written in second quantization , in terms of these exciton operators , @xmath10 as rederived in appendix a , the prefactor @xmath11 is related to the kane vector @xmath12 [ 30 ] for valence - conduction transitions , given by eq.(a.8 ) , through @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the center - of - mass momentum of exciton @xmath15 , @xmath16 its relative motion index , @xmath17 the sample size and @xmath18 the space dimension .",
    "the interaction @xmath19 between a semiconductor and a photon field can also be written in terms of exciton operators .",
    "this actually is far more convenient than using free electron - hole - pair operators as commonly done , since excitons are the physically relevant excitations in semiconductors . for a multifrequency photon field with vector potential @xmath20",
    "introduced adiabatically from @xmath3 over a timescale @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the frequency and momentum of the photons at hand , this interaction reduces , if we only keep resonant terms ( which corresponds to the so - called `` rotating wave approximation '' [ 31 ] ) , to @xmath24 where @xmath25 destroys an exciton according to @xmath26 with a time - dependent weight given by @xmath27 the prefactor @xmath28 in @xmath29 is related to the same kane vector for valence - conduction transitions appearing in the current density , through @xmath30 due to the @xmath31 factor , photons are only coupled to excitons with s symmetry , for their wave function to differ from zero at @xmath32 , the largest coupling being with the ground state because its wave function at the origin is the largest .",
    "the interaction expansion of the current density mean value @xmath33 for a system wave function @xmath34 which obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath35 , only has odd order terms in the semiconductor - photon interaction , since both @xmath5 and @xmath19 create or destroy one exciton . for initial state",
    "@xmath36 taken as the electron - hole pair vacuum @xmath9 , the third order term in @xmath19 is known [ 1,8,13 ] to be given by the integral of a triple commutator ( see appendix b ) . due to eqs.(2.1 ) and ( b.5 ) , @xmath37 ends by reading as @xmath38\\ , \\ ] ] where the prefactor @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 @xmath41 has a nicely compact form , @xmath42,\\t w(t_2)\\right],\\t w(t_3)\\right]|v\\rangle\\ , \\ ] ] which , however , is not nice at all for analytical calculation , as shown below . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the heisenberg representations of operators @xmath6 and @xmath19 , namely , @xmath45 .",
    "( note that the prefactors of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq.(2.8 ) must be complex conjugate since @xmath37 is a real quantity ) .",
    "the problem is to get a compact expression for @xmath48 . in the next section",
    ", we are going to show why the `` brute force '' calculation of the triple commutator appearing in @xmath41 raises a major technical problem which let it open for decades .",
    "thanks to the many - body theory for composite - bosons we constructed [ 20,21 ] , we were able to overcome this difficulty [ 25,26 ] and to derive a compact expression of @xmath37 in terms of the pauli and coulomb scatterings of this theory .",
    "while the expression of @xmath37 we then obtained is fully correct , it turns out that , in preparing the present manuscript , we have found a way to greatly simplify our first calculation .",
    "this more elegant derivation is given in section 4 .",
    "it however is of interest to put this new calculation in its `` historical '' context by briefly presenting the `` brute force '' calculation of the triple commutator , in order to grasp the fundamental difficulty raised by a nave approach to third order susceptibility .",
    "the brute force calculation of @xmath48 corresponds to expand the triple commutator of eq.(2.10 ) and to calculate its eight terms separately .",
    "this is actually what we first did and reported in refs .",
    "[ 25,26 ] .",
    "this expansion makes appear `` easy terms '' and `` tricky terms '' .",
    "easy terms are trivial to calculate because their intermediate state is the vacuum .",
    "equation ( 2.1 ) leads to @xmath49 in contrast , in tricky terms , the intermediate state is a two - electron - hole - pair state , @xmath50 so that these tricky terms are impossible to calculate exactly as the semiconductor eigenstates for two pairs are unknown .",
    "the trouble is that the easy terms generate volume linear contributions which can not exist in the final expression of the linear susceptibility , as this quantity is intensive .",
    "the volume linear contributions of the easy terms thus have to cancel out exactly with similar ones coming from the tricky terms . in order to prove it and extract these volume linear terms from the tricky terms ,",
    "it is necessary to find a way to manipulate these tricky terms .",
    "up to our many - body theory for composite bosons and the tools it provides , this was not possible ; this is why the calculation of this triple commutator remained an open problem [ 2 - 4 ] , except for very simple hamiltonians for which the two - pair eigenstates could be analytically determined [ 5,11 ] .",
    "let us now outline how the volume linear part of the tricky terms can be extracted .    in the rhs of eq.(3.2 ) , we can commute @xmath51 and @xmath52 by using the integral representation of the exponential , namely , @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and the key equation for correlations with excitons [ 20,21 ] , namely , @xmath55 @xmath56 being the creation potential for coulomb interaction with the exciton @xmath57 , defined as @xmath58=e_nb_n^\\dag+v_n^\\dag$ ] .",
    "this leads to ( cf .",
    "[ 21 ] section 6.2 ) @xmath59 @xmath60 when used in eq.(3.2 ) , eq.(3.5 ) generates two terms . the first one , which now has @xmath8 acting on one exciton , readily gives , due to eq.(2.1 ) , @xmath61 the above scalar product can then be expressed in terms of pauli scatterings for carrier exchanges between excitons as [ 20,21 ] @xmath62 if we then collect all the @xmath63 parts of the various tricky terms produced by this procedure , it is possible to show that they cancel out all the easy terms . we thus are left with contributions from the tricky terms coming from the @xmath64 part of eq.(3.8 ) and from the @xmath65 term of eq.(3.5 ) .",
    "this makes the physical origin of these remaining terms quite clear : @xmath48 has one part coming from pauli exclusion and one part coming from coulomb interaction .    it is possible to calculate the pauli contribution to @xmath48 analytically in terms of exciton energies and pauli scatterings @xmath66 with exciton @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the fact that two - pair states play a role in this problem somehow remains , since the coulomb part of @xmath48 contains scalar products like @xmath67 . by using one of the key equations of the composite - boson many - body theory [ 20,21 ] , namely , @xmath68=\\sum_{p , q}\\xi\\left(^{q\\ \\,n}_{p\\ m}\\right)b_p^\\dag b_q^\\dag\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the direct coulomb scattering of this theory",
    ", we can rewrite this scalar product as @xmath70 the exact calculation of the above matrix element is not possible because it imposes the knowledge of the whole two - pair eigenstate spectrum analytically .",
    "we can however estimate such a term in two limits ,    \\(i ) close to a biexciton resonance : if @xmath71 is the biexciton ground state with energy @xmath72 , eq.(3.10 ) then reduces to @xmath73    \\(ii ) at large detuning : equations ( 3.4 ) , ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) allow to expand eq.(3.10 ) in ratios of coulomb scattering divided by detuning which are small in the large detuning limit .",
    "even if the above procedure is rather straightforward once eq.(3.5 ) is given , to indeed show that all the volume linear terms cancel out exactly relies on an analytical calculation which turns out to be extremely heavy .",
    "it is then reasonable to think that if such a cancellation has to exist , there must be a clever way to show it , which avoids going through the calculation of these eight terms explicitly .",
    "this is what we present in the next section .",
    "due to the formal simplicity of this calculation , it becomes easy to include a multifrequency photon field , the result we first reported being obtained for one photon frequency only .",
    "we come back to eq.(2.10 ) and first calculate the commutator @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "this is easy to do thanks again to eq.(3.5 ) .",
    "we find that this commutator contains a coulomb term in which enters the creation potential @xmath75 , a pauli term in which enters the deviation - from - boson operator @xmath76 and a scalar . since the scalar disappears when included in the triple commutator of eq.(2.10 ) , this readily shows that @xmath48 , as well as all higher order susceptibilities which read in terms of higher order commutators , only have pauli and coulomb contributions .",
    "this result , obtained within a few lines , is already quite nice for the understanding of the physics which controls optical nonlinearities .",

    "other coulomb interactions between the two excitons can be included along the same line to get the detuning expansion of the third order response function .",
    "we see that the above discussion based on shiva diagrams for exciton interactions [ 21,22 ] makes the various terms of @xmath48 rather obvious .      from eqs.(2.8 ) and",
    "( 5.1 ) , we see that @xmath37 contains a summation over excitons @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath189 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , with @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the relative motion index and @xmath193 the center - of - mass momentum of exciton @xmath57 .",
    "\\(i ) since through the exciton - photon couplings @xmath28 , relevant excitons @xmath194 have a momentum equal to the one of the photon to which they are coupled , while both pauli and coulomb scatterings conserve momentum , all exciton momenta in eq.(5.1 ) are of the order of photon momenta , i.e. , small on the characteristic scale of excitons .",
    "consequently , we can take @xmath14 and all @xmath193 s equal to zero .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath5 _ a priori _ contains contributions from all excitonic levels . for practical use , it is however possible to restrict the summation to the ground state exciton : the photons at hand usually have a detuning with respect to this ground state exciton which is rather large to avoid absorption on the sides of the exciton line , but not that large to possibly mix the various exciton levels in the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "moreover , due to the @xmath195 factor appearing in @xmath11 and in @xmath28 , these couplings are the largest when @xmath196 corresponds to the relative motion ground state @xmath197 . for these reasons ,",
    "it is possible to replace @xmath16 and all @xmath192 s by @xmath198 , with one exception in the pauli term as we now show .",
    "\\(iii ) as a matter of fact , by looking at this pauli term , eq.(4.16 ) , we see that the sum over @xmath199 can be readily done , which is more valuable than replacing @xmath199 by @xmath198 .",
    "the only factors which depend on @xmath199 are the coupling @xmath177 proportional to @xmath200 and the pauli scattering @xmath166 which , when all exciton momenta are equal to zero , reduces to [ 20,21 ] @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the relative motion wave function of state @xmath57 in momentum space . the closure relation @xmath203 then allows us to readily calculate the sum over @xmath199 : after replacing @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath15 by @xmath204 , we get @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is given by @xmath207    on the other hand , in the large detuning limit of the coulomb term given by eqs.(5.1 ) and ( 5.4 ) , we can replace @xmath15 and the @xmath57 s by @xmath208 .",
    "since @xmath209 [ 21 ] , we are left with the coulomb exchange term in which appears @xmath210 given by [ 21 ] @xmath211}\\hspace{3cm}\\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\ \\frac{(\\v g.a_{j_1})^\\ast\\,(\\v g.a_{j_2})^\\ast\\,(\\v g.a_{j_3})}{(\\omega_{j_1o}+\\omega_{j_2o } -\\omega_{j_3o}+3i\\epsilon)(\\omega_{j_2o}+i\\epsilon)(\\omega_{j_3o}-i\\epsilon)}\\ + \\ \\mathrm{c.c.}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prefactor @xmath212 reads as @xmath213 by replacing the ground state wave function in momentum space @xmath214 and the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath215 by their values in 3d or in 2d , in eqs.(5.8 ) and ( 5.9 ) , we can easily show that @xmath216 and @xmath217 , where @xmath218 and @xmath219 are the 3d exciton rydberg and bohr radius , the prefactors @xmath220 and @xmath221 being equal to @xmath222 and @xmath223 in 3d , while they are equal to @xmath224 and @xmath225 in 2d . note that , due to the @xmath226 factor appearing in these scatterings , @xmath212 is indeed volume free .",
    "this paper shows rather in details how to calculate the current density induced by a multifrequency photon field , starting from its standard textbook expression as a third order time integral of a triple commutator .",
    "it ends by a rather simple approximate expression of this current density when the ground state exciton plays a dominant role .",
    "the procedure which is here reported heavily relies on the tools we have developed in the many - body theory for composite excitons [ 20,21 ] .",
    "these tools mainly allow us to extract the volume linear terms appearing in the standard expression of this nonlinear susceptibility and to show their exact cancellation .",
    "this exact cancellation , which is a necessary requirement since susceptibilities are intensive quantities , stayed an open problem for decades .",
    "the current density ends by reading in terms of pauli scatterings for carrier exchange between two excitons in the absence of carrier interaction , and expands in terms of direct and exchange coulomb scatterings describing coulomb interaction between the carriers of two excitons .",
    "once again , shiva diagrams greatly help to understand the various contributions to the third order response .",
    "although the calculation of this third order susceptibility is conceptually rather trivial because two excitons only are involved , so that it is not at all a @xmath1-body problem , the precise algebra necessary to combine all the terms to get the volume - free final result in a compact form is not that straightforward .",
    "this is why we have found useful to report this calculation rather in details for the reader to possibly reproduce it without difficulty .",

    "since we could not find a textbook in which the following derivation is performed from scratch in a simple way , it appeared to us as useful to have it printed somewhere since the photoinduced current density is the key for any clean description of optical nonlinear effects in semiconductors .",
    "the current density of a set of classical particles located at @xmath229 with charge @xmath230 and velocities @xmath231 , is given by @xmath232 its fourier transform thus reads @xmath233 for quantum particles , the associated operator in first quantization is obtained , as usual , by symmetrizing the classical expression with respect to @xmath234 ; since @xmath235 , this operator thus reads @xmath236 to write it in second quantization , we use the valence and conduction bloch states creation operators @xmath237 where @xmath238 or @xmath239 , with @xmath240 quantized in @xmath241 for a periodic solid of size @xmath17 .",
