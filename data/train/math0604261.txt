    "the laws governing the behavior of the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) on points in the unit disk and ball have been thoroughly researched .",
    "see @xcite for a survey on the worst case . for the average case ( or points taken randomly ) , extremely fine results are known .",
    "see @xcite for the central limit theorem for the total length , @xcite for the dimension of a typical path , @xcite for an `` objective '' approach and @xcite for intriguing simulation results .",
    "see also the book @xcite for the strongly related continuum percolation .",
    "the same questions on other metric spaces , in particular on fractals , have seen much less research . in @xcite",
    "we studied the worst case problem for the total weighted length . here",
    "we switch to the average case and are interested in the length of the longest edge , which , by the greedy algorithm , is the same as the connectivity threshold i.e.  the minimal number @xmath5 such that the graph in which two points are connected if and only if their metric distance is @xmath6 , is connected . in the setting of a ball in @xmath7",
    "this is known to be , with high probability @xmath8 where @xmath9 means that the ratio of the two quantities is bounded between two absolute constants .",
    "we wish to extend this result to fractal sets .",
    "clearly , to get any kind of estimate one has to assume the fractal is connected .",
    "further , it is clear that some kind of regularity is needed . to see why",
    ", it might be instructive to consider the following example : in @xmath10 take the set @xmath11 , consisting of a set of `` thick '' vertical slabs @xmath12\\times[0,1]$ ] connected by `` thin '' horizontal bridges @xmath13\\times\\left[0,2^{-i}\\right]$ ] ; see figure  [ set ] .",
    "take the normalized lebesgue measure on this set .",
    "now take @xmath3 random points and connect them by their mst . since the bridges become thin very fast , there will be no points in the very thin bridges that connect the slabs starting from @xmath14\\times[0,1]$ ] .",
    "thus , the mst will contain edges that are @xmath15 long .",
    "this is despite the fact that this set has hausdorff dimension @xmath16 and in fact is a monofractal ( a degenerate multifractal spectrum ) which indicates strong regularity in some sense .",
    "the metric probability space @xmath17 is _ semi uniform of dimension @xmath1 _ if there exists some numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that for every point @xmath20 and for every @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ball of radius @xmath5 centered at @xmath24 in the metric @xmath25 .",
    "we call @xmath18 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the _ parameters _ of the metric probability space .",
    "examples for such a semi uniform space are the cantor dust or the sierpinski carpet , endowed with the metric of their embedding in @xmath28 and the natural probability measures  @xcite . we show that for such probability spaces the classical asymptotic laws of maximal mst edge still hold with fractional powers , if the space is connected .",
    "for example , in the case of sierpinski s carpet , with dimension @xmath29 , the longest edge of the mst is @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . formally ,",
    "the statement is    let @xmath33 be a compact connected subset of @xmath34 and let @xmath0 be a semi - uniform measure of dimension @xmath1 on @xmath33 .",
    "then there exist two constants @xmath35 such that for all @xmath32 and for any @xmath36 sufficiently large ( depending on @xmath37 ) , if @xmath38 are independent samples from @xmath0 then    1 .   if @xmath39 then the set @xmath40 is connected with probability @xmath31 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath41 then the set @xmath42 is connected with probability @xmath37 .    here and below we shall use the convention that @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote constants whose value might change from formula to formula and even inside the same formula .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 might depend on @xmath1 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath43 will usually denote constants which are `` small enough '' and @xmath44 constants which are `` large enough '' .",
    "to prove the first part of the theorem choose @xmath45 and let @xmath46 be a maximal set of disjoint balls with centers @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath52 occurs with probability @xmath31 .",
    "had all the measures of all the balls been equal , we could have immediatly used coupon collector . however , the measures of the balls are only equal up to a constant factor . still , for all @xmath54 , @xmath55\\enspace .\\",

    ", the maximality of the family @xmath60 implies that the family @xmath61 is a cover of @xmath33 .",
    "since we are given that the event @xmath52 happens it follows that the set @xmath62 contains the set @xmath63 and therefore it also contains @xmath33 .",
    "now the lemma follows directly from the definition of connectivity .",

    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "using @xmath65 it follows that @xmath33 is also separated , and therefore a contradiction .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    with the first part of the theorem demonstrated , let us proceed to the second .",
    "this time choose @xmath68 and have @xmath46 be a maximal set of disjoint balls with centers @xmath47 . then for each @xmath48 , @xmath69\\leq \\frac{\\log m}{2m}\\enspace .\\ ] ]",

    "denote by @xmath73 the indicator to the event that the ball @xmath53 contains exactly one point @xmath48 and have @xmath74 be the random variable that counts the number of such balls in @xmath72 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath75 so for @xmath36 sufficiently large , @xmath76    [ lem : ugly ] for @xmath36 sufficiently large , @xmath77    for any @xmath78 examine the variables @xmath79 and @xmath73 . denote @xmath80 .",
    "then , because @xmath81 we have @xmath82 a similar calculation gives @xmath83 combining both we get , for @xmath36 sufficiently large , @xmath84 this ends the lemma by virtue of ( [ eybig ] ) .    for large enough @xmath36 , event",

    "given that @xmath53 is a ball containing just a single point @xmath48 , it follows that there is a constant probability that this point will be in @xmath88 which would mean that @xmath89 is disconnected . since we have @xmath71 ( bernoulli ) trials the probability for at least one to succeed is @xmath31 .",
    "this proves the lemma and the theorem .",
    "we believe it would be interesting to characterize the fractal sets that naturally induce a semi uniform probability space .",
