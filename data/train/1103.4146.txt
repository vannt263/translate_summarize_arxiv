    "studying star formation in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the galaxy ( within a few hundred pc of the galactic center ) can help provide insight into the structure and evolution of our milky way galaxy , as well as provide a template for studying star formation in the nuclei of other galaxies .",
    "the cmz , which contains @xmath3  5  @xmath4  10@xmath5  m@xmath6 of molecular gas @xcite , is home to several of the prominent star - forming regions toward the galactic center , such as the sgr  a , sgr  b , and sgr  c complexes .",
    "these regions are evolved enough to contain uv - emitting stars , but the cmz also shows evidence of earlier stages of star formation @xcite . among the best tracers of the early stages of star formation are ch@xmath1oh masers and regions of extended , enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "a new method of identifying star formation activity in its early stages is by selecting sources with enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "such sources , commonly called green fuzzies @xcite or extended green objects ( egos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are named for how they appear in _",
    "spitzer_/irac @xcite 3-color images ( 8.0  @xmath0 m in red , 4.5  @xmath0 m in green , and 3.6  @xmath0 m in blue ) .",
    "the enhancement at 4.5  @xmath0 m likely arises from a shock - excited h@xmath7 or co spectral feature in the 4.5  @xmath0 m band ( marston et al .",
    "2004 , noriega - crespo et al .",
    "more recent work by @xcite and @xcite has shown that the 4.5  @xmath0 m emission from some green sources is caused by shock - excited h@xmath7 emission , while others show no prominent spectral features . despite its uncertain origin , enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission , frequently referred to as ` green ' emission in this paper , is a reliable tracer of early protostellar activity @xcite .",
    "another tracer of star formation activity is one of the brightest known maser lines , the ch@xmath1oh transition at 6.7  ghz . this class  ii ch@xmath1oh maser transition , which is thought to be radiatively excited by a central high - mass protostellar object @xcite , exclusively traces high - mass ( @xmath8  8  m@xmath6 ) star formation @xcite .",
    "class  ii masers are often found very close to protostars , supporting this idea @xcite .",
    "collisionally excited class  i ch@xmath1oh masers are also thought to be reliable tracers of star formation . unlike class",
    "ii masers , however , they are not restricted to high - mass star - forming regions , as evidenced by the detection of class  i ch@xmath1oh masers toward low- and intermediate - mass star forming regions @xcite .",
    "class i masers tend to be found at larger angular distances from protostars than class  ii masers @xcite , and are well - correlated with the outflows associated with star formation @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that class  i ch@xmath1oh masers are also associated with regions of shocked gas where expanding regions collide with neighboring molecular clouds @xcite . thus , class  i masers are associated with two evolutionary phases of star formation . because green sources are known to be in early evolutionary phases , class  i masers associated with them are likely to be associated with protostellar outflows rather than regions .",
    "the first to propose a correlation between sources with enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission and ch@xmath1oh masers was @xcite , who found that at least 1/3 of the green sources in the galactic center are associated with ch@xmath1oh maser emission .",
    "subsequent studies @xcite have shown that ch@xmath1oh masers are strongly associated with 4.5  @xmath0 m excess sources in the galactic disk",
    ". moreover , these green sources are also highly associated with : ( 1 ) 24  @xmath0 m emission , indicative of heated dust around a protostar , and ( 2 ) infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , which are known to harbor the early stages of high - mass star formation ( see section  [ irdcs ] ) . because both class  i and class  ii ch@xmath1oh maser emission are generated during high - mass star formation",
    ", their association with 4.5  @xmath0 m excess sources helps to confirm that the green sources are indeed tracing the early stages of high - mass star formation .    in a detailed examination of the star formation in the galactic center ,",
    "@xcite ( y - z09 hereafter ) identified and examined 34 green sources toward the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; see fig .",
    "[ galcen_sources ] ) using _ spitzer_/irac data .",
    "y - z09 identified these sources , by eye , using the empirical ` green ' ratio @xmath11^{0.5}$ ] , which helps select sources that are enhanced at 4.5  @xmath0 m relative to 3.6  @xmath0 m and 5.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "using available published ch@xmath1oh maser data , primarily from targeted observations of known star - forming regions and maser sites , y - z09 found that @xmath3  40% of these green sources are associated with class  i and/or class  ii ch@xmath1oh maser emission . due to the relatively high detection limit ( @xmath3  0.35  jy ) of these observations , however , it is possible that some masers have gone undetected . here , we present our more sensitive ( @xmath12  0.1  jy ) , targeted , 6.7 and 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser observations toward these green sources using the national radio astronomy observatory s expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "in addition to ch@xmath1oh masers , we also search for other star formation indicators that correlate with our sample of 4.5  @xmath0 m emission sources , such as 24  @xmath0 m emission and irdcs .",
    "we investigate whether star formation in the cmz differs from that in the galactic disk .",
    "we used the new 4.0  -  8.0  ghz ( c - band ) capability of the evla to obtain spectral line observations of the 6.6669  ghz 5(1,5)-6(0,6 )  a@xmath13 ch@xmath1oh maser transition @xcite toward a sample of 34 green sources in the central few degrees of the galaxy ( fig .",

    ", we made 31 snapshot observations ( one field contains 3 green sources , and another contains 2 green sources ) of @xmath3  80 seconds each in 2007 december as part of program ay184 . in total , 12 evla antennas were used in the b configuration .",
    "the spectra have 140  km  s@xmath14 ( 3.125  mhz ) bandwidth , 256 channels , and a channel width of 0.54  km  s@xmath14 ( 12.2  khz ) .",
    "the primary beam of the evla at this frequency is @xmath3  7 , the synthesized beams in the processed images are @xmath3  4  x  1 , and the position angles of the synthesized beams range from @xmath1514@xmath16 to 2@xmath16 , with a mean of @xmath157@xmath16 .    to calibrate the 6.7  ghz data , we use standard procedures in aips along with a few modifications to the standard recipe .",
    "the calibrators are 1331 + 305 for flux calibration and 1730 - 130 for phase calibration .",
    "doppler tracking was used for these observations .",
    "after the data were obtained , however , it was determined that the path lengths of the fibers connecting the lo reference signals to the antennas were not taken into account .",
    "after the standard flux and phase calibration , an additional phase modification is applied ( using clcor in aips ) to each antenna to correct for this error . because the sources are within a few degrees on the sky , only one constant offset is necessary , rather than a more time / source specific offset .",
    "this offset modifies the phase only , and thus should not affect the positional or velocity accuracy of the data . for those sources with bright emission , self - calibration is performed on the channel of peak emission ( as identified in the aips task possm ) , and subsequently applied to all other channels .",
    "pbcor is used to correct the flux for primary beam attenuation .",
    "the final sensitivity of these 6.7  ghz data is @xmath3  50  mjy  beam@xmath14 in each spectral channel .    in order to identify ch@xmath1oh masers at wide range of velocities , we made two observations of each field , centered at what were intended to be @xmath2  50  km  s@xmath14 . because doppler tracking was used , however , an error in the online system caused the observed frequencies to be calculated using the submission date of the observe file rather than the actual date of observation . using the online dopset tool and the date of the observations , we calculated what the observing frequency should have been , and found that an offset of 16.3 - 16.8  km  s@xmath14 was introduced by this error , depending on the source .",
    "thus , the central velocities of the two observations for each field are @xmath3  @xmath1533  km  s@xmath14 and @xmath3  @xmath1767  km  s@xmath14 , and our observations cover the entire velocity range from @xmath15103  km  s@xmath14 to @xmath17136  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "to supplement our observations , we also use a portion of the methanol multibeam ( mmb ) survey catalog of 6.7  ghz masers ( * ? ? ?",

    "were carried out using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",

    "c10 found that only one of the 29 class  ii masers in the region containing our green sources is in this velocity range . as a result , it seems unlikely that a significant number of masers have gone undetected in our search . because the the possibility remains , however ,",

    "all of our maser detections , except for one , are present in the c10 catalog . comparing the positions of the masers",

    "the maser positions from our data are identified by the position of the peak pixel rather than an elliptical gaussian fit , possibly resulting in an offset of one or two pixels ( our data have a pixel size of 0.3 ) .",
    "c10 cite a positional uncertainty of 0.4 for their catalog .",
    "together , the positional uncertainties can account for the mean offset of 0.9 , and we consider the masers that we detect to be positional matches to the c10 masers .",
    "moreover , we find an average offset in peak velocity of only 0.2  km  s@xmath14 ( compared to our channel width of 0.54  km  s@xmath14 ) between the two sets of masers . as a result , we are confident that we are detecting the same maser sources as c10 .",

    "this maser has a peak flux of @xmath3  1.4  jy , not much greater than the 1  jy value at which the c10 survey is close to 100% complete @xcite . because 6.7  ghz masers can be variable by factors of a few over timescales of months @xcite , it is not surprising that this maser escaped detection by c10 .",
    "there are four ch@xmath1oh masers , detected by c10 , that are in our fields of view but went undetected in our observations ( 0.167@xmath150.446 , 0.376 + 0.040 , 358.980 + 0.084 , and 359.970@xmath150.457 in the naming scheme of c10 ) .",

    "the collisionally excited masers formed in outflows are typically found at larger angular separations ( up to tens of arcseconds ; * ? ? ? * ) from central protostellar objects than radiatively excited masers .",
    "indeed , @xcite find some 44  ghz masers beyond the extent of the 4.5  @xmath0 m emission used to identify their green sources .",
    "we select a radius of 30 as the maximum separation to associate a 44  ghz maser with a green source .",
    "we find that 8 of 31 green sources are positionally coincident with at least one 44  ghz maser ( fig .",
    "[ galcen_sources ] ) .",
    "it is possible that these sources are not physically associated , especially if they are located at the galactic center distance of @xmath3  8.5  kpc ( where a separation of 30 corresponds to a linear size scale of @xmath3  1.2  pc ) . because the chance of a random alignment of these two signs of star formation activity is low",

    "bright 24  @xmath0 m emission is often associated with star formation .",

    "we find that 24 of the 31 green sources are coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "thus , we can be reasonably sure that these sources are indeed protostellar in nature .",
    "of the seven green sources that do not display 24  @xmath0 m emission , two green sources are close to regions that are very bright at 24  @xmath0 m : sgr  c and sh2 - 20 @xcite .",
    "the bright emission from these sources may be overwhelming any 24  @xmath0 m emission toward the green sources .",
    "thus , the 24  @xmath0 m detection rate toward green sources of 77% ( 24 of 31 ) should be considered a lower limit .",
    "the green sources in our sample are divided into two categories  one consisting of sources likely to be in the galactic center region at a distance of @xmath3  8.5  kpc , and the other likely to be foreground to the galactic center .",
    "as described in y - z09 , the green sources were divided into these two categories based on their galactic latitude .",
    "sources with @xmath24 are assumed to be in the foreground , and sources with @xmath25 are assumed to be at the galactic center distance .",
    "based on this separation method , we find that 16 and 15 green sources in our sample are foreground sources and galactic center sources , respectively .",
    "while this distance estimate may not be exact , it is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "based on the scale height of 24  @xmath0 m sources and young stellar objects in the galactic center ( @xmath3  8 ; y - z09 ) , it is plausible that the green sources at low galactic latitudes are at the distance of the galactic center . with kinematic velocities , one could attempt to derive kinematic distances to these sources . because the sources are close in projection to the galactic center , however , the derived kinematic distances would have very large errors . as a result",
    ", we have not made distance estimates based on kinematics .",
    "the masses of the green sources were determined by y - z09 , who performed sed fits of the sources using yso models @xcite and a linear regression fitter @xcite .",
    "the fits to individual sources range from well - constrained to poorly constrained , and have typical errors of @xmath3  25% .",
    "the current masses derived from these fits range from 2.1 to 29.9  m@xmath6 , with a median mass of 10.3  m@xmath6 .",
    "because these green sources are likely still accreting , their final masses may be larger than their current mass , and the masses we list are a lower limit to the final masses of individual stars .",
    "moreover , the green sources may consist of multiple sources at higher resolution , so the derived masses may represent the mass of a cluster of protostars rather than individual protostars .",
    "nevertheless , the derived masses of the green sources , along with their positional coincidence with class  ii ch@xmath1oh maser emission , make it likely that the green sources harbor high - mass protostars .",

    "green fuzzies and egos have different selection criteria from one another , and from our sample of 31 green sources , but comparisons of the ch@xmath1oh maser detection rates may provide some insight into how these sources are related . for simplicity , we refer to the three types of enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m sources as green sources .",
    "@xcite find that 17% of 47 green sources in galactic disk irdcs are associated with class  i ch@xmath1oh maser emission .",

    "@xcite find that @xmath3  67% of a sample of 61 sources are associated with class  i ch@xmath1oh masers . in our sample of 31 green sources , 12 ( 39  @xmath2  11% )",
    "are associated with 6.7  ghz masers , 8 ( 26  @xmath2  9% ) are associated with 44  ghz masers , and 5 ( 16  @xmath2  7% ) are associated with both maser transitions .",
    "our class  i maser detection rate ( 26  @xmath2  9% ) is in rough agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the maser detection rates , along with the association of both sets of sources with irdcs and 24  @xmath0 m emission , indicates that our green sources are similar in nature to the green sources studied by @xcite .",
    "the difference in the 6.7  ghz maser detection rate between our green sources ( 39  @xmath2  11% ) and the @xcite sample of green sources ( 65% ) is fairly large .",
    "moreover , we find that only 5 of the 12 sources with 6.7  ghz masers ( 42  @xmath2  19% ) also harbor 44  ghz maser emission , while @xcite and @xcite both find higher class  i detection rates .",
    "a possible reason for these discrepancies is that the @xcite and @xcite green sources are larger in angular extent than our green sources .",
    "the green sources in our sample are roughly 5 - 10 in size . the typical green source size in the @xcite and @xcite samples , however , is @xmath3  10 - 20 , with some as large as 30 or more .",
    "if we assume that these larger green sources are located at roughly similar distances to the sources in our sample , then their larger angular sizes would correspond to larger physical sizes . because the extended 4.5  @xmath0 m emission is associated with outflows",
    ", it stands to reason that the @xcite and @xcite green sources are associated with larger outflows , and are therefore more evolved .",
    "the larger , more evolved outflows have a greater surface area of interaction with the surrounding medium , thereby possibly explaining the increased 44  ghz detection rate toward the @xcite and @xcite samples .",
    "alternatively , the difference in the maser detection rates could be due to the the variable nature of ch@xmath1oh maser emission @xcite , combined with the different sensitivities of the surveys . indeed , the 6@xmath20 sensitivity for the @xcite 6.7  ghz observations is @xmath3  0.16  jy , and the 3@xmath20 sensitivity of our 6.7  ghz observations is 0.15  jy .",
    "both enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission ( used to identify green sources ) and 24  @xmath0 m emission are star formation indicators , and when they are coincident with one another , they are a powerful identifier of active star formation @xcite .",
    "we find that 77% ( 24 of 31 ) of the green sources in our sample are coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the detection rate of 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers for green sources coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission is 46@xmath214% , and is 29@xmath220% for those without 24  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the detection rate of 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers for green sources coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission is 29@xmath211% .",
    "we detect only one 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser toward a green source without 24  @xmath0 m emission ( detection rate of 14@xmath214% ) .",
    "again , we are limited by the small number of statistics and the large errors , and conclusions drawn from this sample should be taken with caution .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that green sources with 24  @xmath0 m emission are more likely to harbor both 6.7 and 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers than the green sources that are not coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission ( see tables  [ maser - summary ] and [ fg - gc - summary ] ) .",
    "if true , these results once again show that the combination of enhanced 4.5  @xmath0 m emission , 24  @xmath0 m emission , and ch@xmath1oh maser emission are reliable protostellar locators .    even though the green sources that are coincident with 24  @xmath0 m emission seem more likely to harbor ch@xmath1oh masers , we do detect masers toward green sources that display no 24  @xmath0 m emission . these sources may contain 24  @xmath0 m emission too faint to detect using our mips data . alternatively , they may be at a different , perhaps earlier , evolutionary state , before the dust around the central protostar has heated sufficiently to emit brightly at 24  @xmath0 m . finally , it is also possible that some ( or all ) of these green sources are not related to star formation .",
    "for example , planetary nebulae may also appear as 4.5  @xmath0 m enhancement sources  recall that three green sources in our original sample have been excluded from this analysis because their positions coincide with those of known planetary nebulae .",
    "we find that higher - mass sources are more likely to harbor 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers than lower - mass sources .",
    "the median mass of green sources associated with 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers is 12.7  m@xmath6 , while the median mass for those not associated with 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers is 9.5  m@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ mass_histos ] ) . using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , we calculate a 76% chance that the mass distributions of green sources with and without 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission are drawn from a different parent distribution .",

    "we find only a 5% chance that the mass distributions of sources with and without 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh masers are drawn from a different parent distribution ( according to a k - s test ) . because the mass distributions of green sources with and without 6.7  ghz masers are likely to be different , and because the population associated with 6.7 ch@xmath1oh masers has a larger median mass than those without , we conclude that higher - mass sources are more likely to display 6.7  ghz maser emission than lower - mass sources .",
    "the case is less clear for the 44  ghz masers , the detections of which show no clear correlation with mass .",
    "the lowest mass that a 6.7  ghz maser is associated with is 4.9@xmath21.8  m@xmath6(g22 ) . because the masses determined by y - z09 are the current masses of the sources ( not the final masses ) , it is possible that this source will evolve into a high - mass ( @xmath8  8  m@xmath6 ) star through accretion , consistent with the idea that 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission exclusively traces high - mass star formation .",
    "moreover , g22 is assumed to be foreground to the galactic center ; if it is instead at the distance of the galactic center , its derived mass would increase .",
    "the lowest mass source associated with a 44  ghz maser is 2.1@xmath21.2  m@xmath6 ( g12 ) . because of its lower mass",
    ", the likelihood of this source evolving into a high - mass star is smaller .",
    "the association of g12 with a 44  ghz maser supports with the hypothesis that this maser transition traces low - mass star formation in addition to high - mass star formation .",
    "to study how star formation in the galactic center s cmz may differ from that of the galactic disk , we studied ch@xmath1oh maser emission toward a sample of 34 green sources .",
    "of the 15 galactic center green sources , we find that 5 are associated with radiatively excited class  ii 6.7  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission , and 4 are associated with collisionally excited class  i 44  ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission .",
