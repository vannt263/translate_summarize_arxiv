    "over the years black hole solutions have played a key role in recent developments in theoretical physics due to its unique window into quantum gravity . in particular , the lower - dimensional black holes , like btz black hole bana:92 , has been crucial in understanding the holographic description of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimesahar:00 , other than as just a simpler analog of its higher dimensional counterpart .    in asymptotically de sitter ( ds ) spacetimes , however , the lower - dimensional analog of black holes is not known , even though there are solutions with the cosmological horizon dese:84,park:98 . it would be desirable to have available a lower - dimensional analog which could exhibit the key features of its higher - dimensional counterparts .",
    "this would be important in the holographic description of ds spacetimes also park:98,stro:01,bala:02 , as btz black hole did in ads .",
    "on the other hand , the conventional black holes are perturbative solution in that their horizon sizes scale with ( some positive powers of ) the newton s constant @xmath0 .",
    "there have been numerous works on the emergence of a new ( inner ) horizon in the black hole spacetimes when the gaussian but _ an_isotropic , i.e. , @xmath1 , smearing of point - matter distributions with energy - momentum @xmath2 , in a `` self - consistent '' way anso:08 .",
    "however , the gaussianity needs not be required always , though beyond the gaussianity has not been studied much so far : as a deformation of @xmath3-function source , it is enough that the distribution has a sharp peak at the origin as the characteristic size shrinks to zero , maintaining the integration of the distribution function to be finite so that it can be normalized to unity always .",
    "actually , the necessity of this kind of non - gaussian _ regularization _ of the @xmath3-function has been noted earlier , in a study of quantum gravity by dewitt dewi:67 , though its physical origin was not understood .",
    "more recently , myung and yoon have constructed a deformed @xmath4 black hole , based on rayleigh distribution which is one of the non - gaussian distributions myun:08 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to report that the three - dimensional analog of ds black holes does exist when _",
    "non_-gaussian smearings of point matter _ hairs _ are considered , generally black holes in higher dimensions , see dymn:98 . ] .    in this paper ,",
    "i consider the general form of matter distributions , which include the gaussian , rayleigh , and maxwell - boltzmann distributions with moments @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "it is shown that there are black hole solutions for all the higher - moment matter distributions , except the conventional gaussian one .",
    "this provides a new way of constructing black hole solutions _ from _ hairs .",
    "it is found that the strong energy condition is satisfied near the black holes so that the usual area ( increasing ) theorem is guaranteed , like the conventional black holes in _",
    "vacuum_. by demanding the area law , following the bekenstein s argument , and the first law of thermodynamics , the black hole mass is identified .",
    "however , i find that the obtained black hole solutions are quite different from those of the conventional ( large ) black holes in thermodynamical properties in that there are large to small black hole transitions which may be considered as inverse hawking - page transitions .",
    "the black holes show also soliton - like ( i.e. , non - perturbative ) behaviors . for the gaussian distribution",
    ", there is no black hole but a gravastar solution exists , instead .",
    "the three - dimensional einstein gravity with a positive cosmological constant @xmath6 is described by the action on a manifold @xmath7 ( omitting some boundary terms )    [ eh ]",
    "i_g= _ m d^3 x ( r -2  ) + i_matter ,    where @xmath8 is a matter action whose ( microscopic ) details are not important in this paper .",
    "the equations of motion for the metric are given by    [ eom ] r^-12 g^ r + 1l^2 g^ = 8 g  t^_matter    with the matter s energy - momentum tensor    [ t : matter ] t^_matter = -2 i_matterg_.    in order to solve the equation ( [ eom ] ) , i take the static metric ansatz @xmath9 here note that @xmath10 like the usual vacuum solution dese:84,park:98 but this may not be true for arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "so , i am considering the specific matter configurations which do not deform ( [ btz ] ) . by considering matter s energy - momentum    [ t : an - iso ] t^_=diag ( - , p_r , p _ ) ,    the einstein equation ( [ eom ] ) reads    ( n^2)2r&=&--8 g , + ( n^2)2r&=&-+8 g p_r , + ( n^2)2r&=&-+8 g p _ ,    where prime @xmath12 denotes the derivative with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "the solutions of @xmath14 are given by    n^2&=&-r^2 -16 g ^r_0 r dr , [ n^2 ] + p_r&=&- , [ p : r ] + p_&=&-(r )  , [ p : phi ]    where i have set @xmath15 in order to be agreed with the vacuum de sitter solution for @xmath16 .",
    "( [ p : r ] ) and ( [ p : phi ] ) show that a non - vanishing radial pressure @xmath17 and an - isotropic tangential pressure @xmath18 for an arbitrary matter distribution with @xmath19 are needed , respectively .",
    "hence , the ansatz ( [ btz ] ) , together with ( [ t : an - iso ] ) , determines the metric and matter s pressures completely , in terms of the matter density @xmath20 .",
    "now , let me introduce the matter density as    [ density ] = a r^nl^n+2 e^-r^2/l^2 ,    where @xmath21 is a characteristic length scale of the matter distribution and @xmath22 is a normalization constant .",
    "one can obtain the gaussian distribution for @xmath23 , and non - gaussian ( i.e. , ring - type ) distributions for higher moments , i.e. , rayleigh for @xmath24 , maxwell - boltzman for @xmath25 , etc .",
    "then , by plugging ( [ density ] ) into ( [ n^2 ] ) , one can easily find    n^2&=&-r^2 -8 g a  ( n2 + 1 , r^2l^2 ) + & = & -r^2 -8 g a  , [ dsbh ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the incomplete lower and upper gamma functions , respectively .",
    "what we know is that the einstein equation is _ uniquely _ solved by the @xmath28 solution dese:84,park:98    [ ds_3 ] n^2_ds_3=-r^2l^2 + 8 g m    in the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath29 , limit and there is a cosmological horizon at @xmath30 with the de sitter mass @xmath31 . from this boundary condition , which distinguishes the matter distribution for the smearing of point sources with the _ classical _ matter distributions , one obtains    [ a ] a =- m ( n2 + 1 )    and then ( [ dsbh ] ) reads    [ n^2:final ] n^2=-r^2l^2 + 8 g m    with @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that this reduces to the @xmath28 metric with ( [ ds_3 ] ) from the fact that the last term in @xmath33 $ ] vanishes in the @xmath29 limit . in the presence of the smeared matters the cosmological horizon of the ( vacuum ) @xmath28 solution ( [ ds_3 ] ) would be shifted also .",
    "now , in order to see whether there exists a black hole horizon , i need to know whether @xmath34 has interior roots , other than the cosmological horizons .",
    "the ( black hole and cosmological ) horizons , if exist , satisfy , one rather solves @xmath35=0 $ ] with a particle s mass @xmath36 .",
    "but it is easy to see that the horizon does not occur since @xmath37 always for @xmath38 . ]",
    "[ horizon ] _",
    "^2 = 8 g m l^2    but it is hard to solve this analytically .    an easier way to find the existence of the ( interior ) black hole horizons is to consider the , so - called , _ nariai _ limit , where the black hole horizon @xmath39 and the cosmological horizon @xmath40 meet , i.e. , @xmath41 , at which @xmath42 as well as @xmath34 .",
    "if there exists a _",
    "solution for the _ nariai radius _ @xmath43 , the black hole horizon @xmath39 also exist , as well as the cosmological horizon @xmath40 , since @xmath44 . from @xmath42 ,",
    "one has    r=8 gm l^2 ( rl ) ^n+1",
    "( n2 + 1 ) l e^-r^2l^2 .    by plugging this into the left hand side of ( [ horizon ] ) , with an identification of @xmath45 ,",
    "one has an algebraic equation    f(_nar;l ) ( _ narl ) ^n+2",
    "e^-_nar^2l^2-(n2 + 1 , _",
    "nar^2l^2 ) = 0 ,    which does not depend on the dimensionful parameters of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , but depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath48 , for each @xmath49 .",
    "so , the existence problem of the @xmath28 black holes reduces to a purely mathematical problem of finding the number @xmath50 and let me call this _ nariai number _ , for convenience .",
    "the explicit formula for the nariai numbers is not known but one can find them numerically by plotting @xmath51 as in fig.1 , which reads @xmath52 , etc .     vs. @xmath53 for various @xmath49 .",
    "the nariai numbers @xmath54 are the intersection points of @xmath55 , other than the trivial one at @xmath56 .",
    "nariai number increases indefinitely as @xmath49 is increased .",
    "numerically , it reads @xmath57 , etc .",
    "( left to right).,width=453 ]    this result shows that there exist ( three - dimensional ) de sitter black holes only for the non - gaussian distributions , i.e. , @xmath58 . on the other hand , for the gaussian distributions the solution correspond to a `` gravastar '' , a compact self - gravitating object without horizons mazu:01 .",
    "in order to study the physical properties of de sitter black holes , i need to know the detailed form of the horizon @xmath39 .",
    "however , since ( [ horizon ] ) can not be solved analytically , i consider the _ perturbative _ solution near the origin , by demanding @xmath39 is very small ; this is a reasonable assumption for small @xmath21 since @xmath39 should be disappeared as @xmath21 goes to zero .    by expanding ( [ n^2:final ] ) near @xmath59 , neglecting higher- order terms    n^2 = -r^2l^2 ,    one finds the black hole horizon as    _ - ( ( n+2 ) ( n2 + 1)16 g m l^2 ) ^1n l^1 + 2n .",
    "the black hole horizon is proportional to ( positive powers of ) @xmath21 and so becomes very small as @xmath29 , which provides a validity criteria of the approximation .",
    "in contrast to the ( outer ) cosmological horizon , the size of black hole is `` inversely '' proportional to the _ initial _",
    "@xmath28 mass @xmath31 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the black holes are _ soliton - like _",
    "( i.e. , non - perturbative ) objects since their ( horizon ) sizes dominate in weaker couplings of the newton s constant @xmath0 .",
    "the hawking temperature is obtained as    [ t : h ] t_h= .",

    "note that the temperature ( [ t : h ] ) is an exact form in @xmath63 , though we do not know the exact algebraic form of @xmath63 in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath49 .",
    "some of the plots for @xmath64 are shown in fig.2 ( solid lines ) .",
    "for the gaussian case ( @xmath23 ) , there is _ no _ zero - temperature cusp : this is due to the absence of a black hole horizon @xmath39 and ( [ t : h ] ) is the hawking temperature for the cosmological horizon @xmath40 only . for the non - gaussian cases ( @xmath65 ) , there are two branches of temperature curves with a zero - temperature cusp at the intersections : the left - hand side curves represent the black hole temperatures for the horizon @xmath39 and the right - hand side curves represent those of cosmological horizons @xmath40 .",
    "the systems are in thermal equilibrium with zero temperature at the nariai limit , like the usual higher - dimensional _ ds _ black hole systems gibb:77.in ads or flat cases , this corresponds to the extremal black holes myun:08,myun:07 .",
    "but it is remarkable that there exists an upper bound of the black hole temperature , which will be discussed further below . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of the cosmological horizon becomes lower , due to the existence of zero temperature at the nariai limit .     for @xmath64 ( bottom to top in the small ( left ) branches and top",
    "to bottom in the large ( right ) branches ) .",
    "the solid lines denote the exact formula ( [ t : h ] ) and the cross lines denote the small black hole approximations in ( [ t : approx ] ) .",

    "note that the temperature vanishes for the gaussian ( @xmath23 ) case , as expected , and those for non - gaussian ( @xmath65 ) cases are plotted in fig.2 ( cross lines ) , in comparison with the exact curves ( solid lines ) .",
    "this shows that there are good agreements for the first several non - gaussianities . from this approximate temperature formula ( [ t : approx ] ) , one can find the approximate formula for `` small '' nariai numbers @xmath68 where @xmath69 vanishes :    [ nariai : approx ] x_nar ( n ) .",
    "the comparisons with the numerical results are shown in table 1 .",

    "the values in the brackets denote the discrepancies with the numerical values . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the black hole entropy , there is no canonical derivation , like the euclidean action approach .",
    "but it does not seem that these black holes violate the bekenstein s area _ law _ , i.e. , entropy being `` linearly '' proportional to the horizon area beke:73 , since the hawking s area ( increasing ) _ theorem _ is guaranteed due to the strong energy conditions , as will be discussed in detail below .",
    "in other words , i _ demand _ that the black hole entropy as    s 2 _ -4 g.    but here , the ( positive ) coefficient @xmath70 is not fixed to @xmath71 as in the bekenstein - hawking entropy for the conventional _ large _ black holes hawk:71 , similarly to the so - called `` small black holes '' in higher curvature supergravities cai:08 ; this would be determined from other independent analysis .",

    "the analytic integration of ( [ m ] ) is not available .",
    "but for the small black hole approximation , ( [ m ] ) reads    m(_- ) = 16 g l^2 _ -^2 .    in this approximate formula ,",
    "the mass has maxima at the nariai radius where the temperature vanishes by definition , from @xmath75 . since @xmath39 is less than or equal to the nariai radius , the black hole mass is always monotonically increasing in the allowed regions , consistently with the assumption for ( [ m ] ) .    the heat capacity @xmath76 is given by    c&= & l2 g t_h ( d t_hd x ) ^-1 , + d t_hd x&= & l2 l^2 1(n2 + 1 , x^2 ) ^2    with @xmath77 .",
    "there is an infinite discontinuity in the heat capacity @xmath78 [ @xmath79 ] at the location of the maximum temperature @xmath80 and the critical horizon radius @xmath81 since @xmath82 .",
    "the critical location is obtained approximately as    x_c _ c / l=    from    d t_hd x = n l4 l^2    for the small black holes . as for the black holes radiate , @xmath69 decreases @xmath83 for the smaller black holes with @xmath84 ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) but @xmath69 increases ( @xmath86 ) for the larger black holes with @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",
    "so , there are transitions between the _ locally _ thermodynamically stable ( @xmath89 ) and unstable ( @xmath86 ) phases but it is peculiar that the smaller ones are more stable , in contrast to the three - dimensional _ kerr - de sitter _ park:98 or higher - dimensional @xmath90 black holes in _ vacuum _ hawk:83 .",
    "generally , the `` local '' thermodynamic instability does not necessarily imply the `` global '' instability , i.e. , unstable to decay into _ globally _ favored states via quantum tunneling pres:00 . in the canonical ensemble with a fixed temperature , the global ( in)stability is governed by the ( helmholtz ) free energy @xmath91 in such a way that the free energy is minimized , globally .",
    "the numerical plots of the free energy vs. hawking temperature are shown in fig .",
    "it is important to note that there are two , upper and lower , branches for the large and small black holes , respectively , with @xmath92 at the _ same _ temperature and they meet exactly at the point where @xmath69 is maximum and @xmath93 are continuous but only @xmath94 is discontinuous at the critical point . ] .",
    "this means that the region of local ( in)stability coincides `` exactly '' with that of global ( in)stability and the global transitions via tunnelings from large to small black holes corresponds to `` inverse '' hawking - page transitions hawk:83 cham:99 .",
    "( see the branches 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "recently , this has been argued in the higher - dimensional regular black holes myun:07,myun:07b , where the lower bounds of the horizons exist at the extremal black holes , but the status of the adm mass or the first law of thermodynamics for the regular black holes remains unclear . ] , with tunneling amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( @xmath22 is some determinant and @xmath97 is the _ on - shell _ euclidean action ) .",
    "there is no lower bound in the size of small black holes but rather an upper bound at the nariai limit .",
    "as one increases the size of the small black hole , i.e. , increasing the characteristic scale @xmath21 , there are more smearings of the matter hairs _ outside _ the ( inner , black - hole ) horizon until the critical size @xmath81 when the maximum temperature @xmath80 is reached .",
    "further increase of the size beyond the critical size produces tunneling decays into the smaller ones with the same temperature , by _",
    "re_-absorbing the excess matter hairs on the one hand and more rapid hawking radiations due to @xmath86 on the other hand .",
    "i note also that the transitions from small black holes with higher moments ( @xmath98 ) into large or other small black holes with lower moments ( @xmath49 ) are also possible , i.e. , @xmath99 , when the temperatures have overlapping regions .     vs. hawking temperature for @xmath100 ( left to right ) ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "for each curve with a given @xmath49 , there are two ( upper and lower ) branches which meet at the maximum temperature @xmath80 .",
    "the upper ( lower ) branch represents the large ( small ) black hole , giving @xmath102 .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "from the normalization of ( [ a ] ) , one finds the energy density of smeared ( point ) matters as with the non - gaussian smearing of @xmath103-function , @xmath104 , which satisfies @xmath105 .",
    "sometimes , it has been said that the black holes `` degenerate '' to a conical singularity at the origin , by bousso , et .",
    "al . bous:02 .",
    "their idea is `` materialized '' in my construction . ]",
    "[ density : normalized ] = -m ( n2 + 1 ) r^nl^n+2 e^-r^2/l^2 .    for the _ initially _",
    "@xmath28 space , one has a positive mass @xmath106 , the matter s energy density @xmath20 is negative , and so the weak and dominant energy conditions are violated in the _ whole _ space . however ,",
    "less restrictive but more important conditions in the black hole dynamics , like the strong or null energy condition can be satisfied .    to see this , let me consider @xmath107 which are obtained as    [ rho : normalized ] + p_&=&-r =m ( n2 + 1 ) l^n+2(n -2 r^2l^2 ) r^n e^-r^2/l^2 , + + _ i p_i & = & p_=m ( n2 + 1 ) l^n+2(n+1 -2 r^2l^2 ) r^n e^-r^2/l^2 ,    where i have used @xmath108 from ( [ p : r ] ) , ( [ p : phi ] ) , and ( [ density : normalized ] ) .",
    "then one finds that @xmath109 for @xmath110 , whereas @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "hence , it is found that the strong energy condition ( sec ) , which includes the null energy condition ( nec ) pois:04 is satisfied when @xmath113 . in order that the black hole has the required behaviors like the increasing horizon area for the accretion of the surrounding matters , i need to require @xmath114 .",
    "this yields    [ sec ] 8 g m l^2l^2 > n2 ( n2 + 1 ) ( n2 + 1 , n2 )    from @xmath115 . for a good approximation , up to @xmath116 , the right hand side of ( [ sec ] )",
    "converges as ` @xmath117 ' and so ( [ sec ] ) can be written approximately as    m l^28 gl^2 ( 2.345 + 1.08",

    "so , in this case , the cosmological horizon would not satisfy the hawking s area ( increasing ) theorem .",
    "however , the black hole would satisfy the area theorem well . for the gravastar case ( @xmath23 )",

    "i have studied the @xmath28 black holes for the non - gaussian and gravastars for gaussian smearings of point - matter sources or hairs .",
    "i have studied the particular class of metrices satisfying @xmath10 for simplicity .",
    "it would be a challenging problem to generalize this construction to include the `` rotating '' black holes and its associated _ horizon smearings _ which have been perturbatively studied in non - commutative btz black hole showing the interior black hole _ inside _ the inner btz black hole horizon , as well kim:08 .",
