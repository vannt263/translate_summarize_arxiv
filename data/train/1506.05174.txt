    "<S> this generalized approach has lead to designing more robust experimental tests of contextuality @xcite ; these recent results are very promising given that previously requirements for testing contextuality in experiments has been a topic of much controversy ( for a more discussion see the ref . @xcite and relevant references therein ) .    </S>",

    "<S> further the authors showed that the success rate of the pom game played with only classical resources is restricted by the same inequality . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spekkens and coauthors concluded that any operational theory is preparation contextual if it can beat the classical bound in a pom task .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , in performing a pom task , certain quantum resources can do better than any classical resource , thus proving that qm is a preparation contextual theory . </S>",

    "<S> , it has been shown that the only classical encodings of @xmath12 that reveal no information about any parity ( while encoding some information about @xmath12 ) are those that encode only a single bit @xmath129 for some @xmath130 . for simplicity , without loss of generality , consider that the shared variable takes discrete values @xmath131 with @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> if the variable takes value @xmath133 then alice encodes her @xmath134 bit and sends it to bob . </S>",
    "<S> bob , if asked , can correctly reveals this @xmath134 bit while for him other bits ( @xmath135 ) are completely random . thus using local correlation ( shared randomness ) alice and bob can design a strategy for determining only one bit with certainty . </S>",
    "<S> but , whichever bit bob guesses correctly , the ( average ) success probability of bob s guess is bounded by the noncontextual bound @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , due to convexity of distribution @xmath128 , it follows that any local correlation can not beat the noncontextual bound .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88    _ remark _ : here it is important to note that in a pom game to obtain greater success than the classical bound , the theory need not contain nonlocal correlations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider a theory in which individual state space is identical as quantum state space but the composite state space is severely restricted than quantum state space . </S>",
    "<S> the state space of the composite system is _ minimal tensor product _ @xcite of individual hilbert space and hence contains only separable states and hence no nonlocal correlation . </S>",
    "<S> in such a theory one can obtain the success probability of pom game as much as quantum theory by following the optimal encoding - decoding scheme of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> what the proposition-2 proves is that if one wants to play the pom game by using correlation of such local theory she / he will not get any advantage .    * </S>",
    "<S> proposition-@xmath137 * : _ any no - signaling correlation @xmath138 violating bell - chsh inequality can exceed the classical bound for performing the 2-bit parity - oblivious multiplexing task . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if using a correlation average success in 2-bit pom game exceeds the quantum limit , then nonlocality of such correlation must exceed the cirelson bound . </S>",
    "<S> _    _ outline of proof _ : a proof follows from : ( i ) using the protocol for 2-bit random access code scenario discussed by pawlowaski _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the context of information causality , and ( ii ) showing that this protocol respect the parity obliviousness condition . </S>",
    "<S> then this implies that , any nonlocal correlation can achieve more than the classical limit for 2-bit pom task . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the quantum limit for 2-bit pom game nonlocality of correlation is restricted by the cirelson bound . </S>",
    "<S> we give a complete proof of the proposition in the supplementary @xcite-(c ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88    in quantum world using correlations of entangled particles alice and bob can win the pom game with more than classical ( noncontextual ) success probability . using the steerability @xcite of the entangled state and </S>",
    "<S> the classical communication alice tries to prepare bob s state in different preparations depending on the input string given to her . for achieving the best result alice attempts to prepare bob s particle into states which achieve optimal success probability in the encoding - decoding scheme . </S>",
    "<S> sharing two - qubit maximally entangled state alice can prepare the optimal states by echoing an identical procedure as in the remote state preparation protocol @xcite ( see @xcite-(b ) for the protocol ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however , presence of steering , alone , in a theory is not sufficient for achieving more than classical success probability ; the theory must also be preparation contextual . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , there exists hypothetical _ toy bit _ </S>",
    "<S> theory @xcite which allows steering , but the success probability of pom in this theory is restricted to the classical bound as the theory is preparation noncontextual ( see @xcite-(d ) ) . on the other hand , though steerability in quantum theory is maximal , the optimal success probability of pom task is restricted due to its limited preparation contextuality .    to conclude , in this work we have considered an operational way to quantify the preparation contextuality of a general theory . </S>",
    "<S> we , then , show that quantum theory turns out to be less preparation contextual than another operational theory , namely box world . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have shown that , in the quantum world , the restricted bell - chsh violation follows from limited preparation contextuality of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> many researchers have tried to explain the limits of nonlocal feature in qm starting from a number of physically motivated ideas or principles . in particular , by considering various approaches , it has been successfully explained why bell - chsh quantity in quantum theory is restricted to cirelson bound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> having established a link between the concept of nonlocality and preparation contextuality it would be interesting to suggest physical principal(s ) leading to quantum bound on preparation contextuality .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the authors of @xcite have shown that even - parity - oblivious encodings are equivalent to the index game , which implies @xmath139 pom game is equivalent to the well known bell - chsh nonlocal game . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a quantum encoding of @xmath139 pom with average success probability @xmath140 exists only if a quantum strategy for playing the bell - chsh game with the same average success probability exists . </S>",
    "<S> we take a different approach , by maximizing over all possible encoding - decoding schemes allowed in qm , we find the optimal success probability of @xmath22-bit pom game ; it turns out to be restricted compared to a more general operational theory . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that restricted preparation contextuality , therefore , bounds the winning probability of bell - chsh game ( nonlocality ) in quantum theory .    </S>",
