    "low- and intermediate - mass stars ( 18  m@xmath3 ) , the progenitors of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , produce roughly half of the isotopes of neutron(_n_)-capture elements ( atomic number @xmath4 ) in the universe . during the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase ,",

    "neutrons are released in the intershell region primarily through @xmath5c(@xmath6,_n_)@xmath7o , and to a lesser extent @xmath2ne(@xmath6,_n_)@xmath8 mg .",
    "iron - peak seed nuclei capture the neutrons during the interpulse phase , and are transformed into heavier nuclei by a series of @xmath9-decays and _ n_-captures .",
    "the intershell material , enriched in _ n_-capture elements and c , is conveyed to the stellar envelope by the third dredge - up ( tdu ) in stars with initial masses above 1.5  m@xmath3 , and is dispersed into the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) by stellar winds and pn ejection ( busso et al .",
    "1999 ; busso 2006 , these proceedings ) .",
    "abundance determinations in pne can be used to investigate tdu and agb nucleosynthesis in their progenitors . however , the difficulty of accurately determining c abundances in ionized nebulae ( e.g.  kaler 1983 ) and the weakness of _ n_-capture element emission lines ( due to their low cosmic abundances ) have inhibited such studies in the past . it was not until 1994 that _",
    "n_-capture elements were identified in the spectrum of a pn ( pquignot & baluteau 1994 ) . this led dinerstein ( 2001 ) to the realization that two anonymous features seen in the @xmath10 band spectra of pne are in fact fine - structure transitions of the _",
    "n_-capture elements kr ( @xmath11=36 ) and se ( @xmath11=34 ) .",
    "we have conducted a large - scale survey of [ kr  iii ]  2.199 and [ se  iv ]  2.287  @xmath0 m in galactic disk pne . because kr and se are not depleted into dust ( kr is a noble gas , and se is not depleted in the ism ; cardelli et al .",
    "1993 ) , they are useful tracers of _ s_-process enrichments and tdu in pn progenitors . in spite of their small cosmic abundances ( @xmath12 relative to h ) , we have found that se and kr are detectable in a large fraction of pne , and our survey has increased the number of pne with known _ n_-capture element abundances by more than a factor of ten .",
    "using the coolspec spectrometer ( lester et al .  2000 ) on the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory , we have observed @xmath1100 pne from 2.142.30  @xmath0 m .",
    "we observed all objects with a 2.7  slit at a resolution @xmath13 , which is sufficient to resolve the kr and se lines from other nearby features , except in pne exhibiting vibrationally - excited h@xmath14 emission .",
    "we re - observed these objects with a high - resolution ( 1.0  slit , @xmath15 ) setting from 2.1552.205  @xmath0 m , allowing us to resolve [ kr  iii ] from h@xmath14  32@xmath16(3 )  2.201  @xmath0 m .",
    "we estimated the contribution of h@xmath14  32@xmath16(2 ) to the flux of the 2.287  @xmath0 m feature from the strength of h@xmath14  32@xmath16(3 ) or other detected h@xmath14 lines in the spectra .",
    "we expanded our sample with @xmath10 band spectra from the literature for @xmath120 additional pne ( geballe et al .",
    "1991 ; hora et al .  1999 ; lumsden et al .",
    "we therefore have near - infrared spectra of 120 pne , in which we have detected se and/or kr in 79 .",
    "we have derived kr@xmath17/h@xmath18 and se@xmath19/h@xmath18 ionic abundances or upper limits for all objects in our sample .",
    "a five - level model atom was used for kr@xmath17 and a two - level system for se@xmath19 , with transition probabilities from bimont & hansen ( 1986 ; 1987 ) and the collision strengths of schning ( 1997 ) and butler ( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "determining the elemental abundances requires correcting for the abundances of unseen ionization stages .",
    "we have determined ionization corrections for se and kr using the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) , which we modified by adding se and kr to the atomic database . however , this method is complicated by the lack of atomic data governing the ionization balance of se and kr . to reduce the uncertainty in the kr ionization correction ,",
    "we have modeled in detail 10 pne with deep optical spectra exhibiting [ kr  iv ] emission .",
    "we empirically adjusted the approximate kr atomic data so that the models reproduce the observed [ kr  iii ] and [ kr  iv ] emission lines in these 10 objects .",
    "however , no optical se lines have been identified , and therefore our derived se abundances are less accurate than those of kr .",
    "we then constructed a grid of cloudy models in order to derive ionization corrections .",
    "these results are more robust than our previous abundance determinations ( e.g.  sterling & dinerstein 2005 ) , where we assumed that the kr@xmath17 and se@xmath19 ionic fractions are the same as ions of other elements with similar ionization potential ranges .",
    "the details of our photoionization modeling will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( sterling et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .    using these results , we have determined se and kr abundances in each observed pn .",
    "se and kr are enriched in 73% of the pne in which they were detected , and display a range of abundances from slightly subsolar to enhanced by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "these enrichments indicate that the _ s_-process and tdu occurred in the progenitor stars .",
    "in the 20 pne displaying emission from both [ kr  iii ] and [ se  iv ] , we find [ kr / se ]  =  0.33 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with theoretical _",
    "s_-process models ( busso et al .",
    "2001 ; gallino 2005 , priv .  comm . ) for the metallicity range of the observed pne ( @xmath10.31.0  @xmath20 ) .",
    "these models predict [ kr / se ]  =  0.00.5 , depending on the mass of the layer experiencing _",
    "s_-process nucleosynthesis and the initial progenitor mass .",
    "we have searched for correlations between the se and kr abundances and other nebular properties . in particular , se and kr are strongly enriched in type  i pne , which are believed to descend from more massive progenitors ( m@xmath214.0  m@xmath3 ; peimbert 1978 ) , relative to other pne ( table  1 ) .",
    "while the short interpulse times and small intershell masses diminish the role of the @xmath5c neutron source in such intermediate - mass stars ( goriely & siess 2005 ; busso 2006 , priv .  comm . )",
    ", their high intershell temperatures activate the @xmath2ne neutron source .",
    "this produces _",
    "s_-process enrichments significantly different from the @xmath5c source , with light _",
    "n_-capture elements ( such as se and kr ) much more enriched than heavier species .",
    "this correlation provides some of the first evidence ( see also garca - lario et al . , these proceedings ) that the @xmath2ne neutron source is active in intermediate - mass agb stars , which may be important sources of light _",
    "n_-capture elements in the universe .",
    ".se and kr abundances vs.  nebular properties [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath22 from asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 )    we also find that pne with h - deficient wolf - rayet - like ( [ wc ] ) central stars tend to be more enriched in kr than objects with h - rich nuclei ( table  1 ) .",
    "however , such a correlation is not seen in se .",
    "the reason for this is not clear ; possibilities include the larger uncertainties in our se abundance determinations and the potential difficulty of discerning correlations with se , which is less enriched than kr .",
    "regardless , [ wc ] pne deserve further investigation to determine whether they are indeed highly _ s_-process enriched .",
    "the se and kr abundances are expected to correlate with the c / o ratio , since tdu conveys carbon along with _ s_-processed material to the surface of agb stars .",
    "we plot [ kr / h ] and [ se / h ] vs.  c / o in figure  1 . despite the considerable scatter , there appears to be a positive correlation between the _",
    "n_-capture element abundances and c / o .",
    "the relation between se and kr enrichments with c / o is strengthened by correlations with the dust composition ( table  1 ) .",
    "in particular , se is more enriched in pne with c - rich dust than those with o - rich or mixed ( c- and o - rich ) dust types .",
    "similarly , kr is more enriched in pne with c - rich dust than those with mixed dust chemistries .",
    "we have presented preliminary results from the first large - scale survey of _",
    "n_-capture elements in pne .",
    "we have detected near - ir emission lines from se and/or kr in nearly two - thirds of our sample of 120 pne .",
    "se and kr are enriched in 73% of the objects in which they were detected , which we attribute to the occurrence of _",
    "s_-process nucleosynthesis and tdu in their progenitor stars .",
    "se and kr tend to be more enriched in type  i pne than in other objects , which may be evidence for the increasing role of the @xmath2ne neutron source in intermediate - mass pn progenitors .",
    "we also find that se and kr are positively correlated with c / o , as expected from the relation of the _",
