    "in an era of high precision experiments such as the b factories and the lhc , accurate measurements of b - flavored particles can benefit from a better knowledge of charm decays and their branching fractions .",
    "the inclusive decay @xmath12 has not been measured .",
    "this branching fraction can serve as an independent check of the existence of additional exclusive decays of d mesons that contain a @xmath2 meson@xcite , and for @xmath13 physics studies that use the @xmath14 pair to tag the @xmath15 meson@xcite .",
    "in addition , this branching fraction would be helpful in understanding the charm meson decay mechanisms .    in this paper",
    ", we report a first measurement of the inclusive @xmath2 decay branching fractions of charged and neutral @xmath16 mesons and a new search for the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath17 .",
    "this measurement is based on 22.3 @xmath3 of data collected in @xmath4 annihilations at @xmath18 gev at the bepc during the 1992 - 1994 .",
    "the bes detector has been described in detail elsewhere@xcite .    at @xmath19=4.03 gev charm mesons d@xmath6 and d@xmath7",
    "are produced via    @xmath20 + @xmath21 + @xmath22 + followed by cascade decays of the d@xmath23 mesons .",
    "however , the d@xmath24 can decay either to @xmath25 or @xmath26 , so that reconstructing a d meson does not necessarily determine whether the recoiling d meson is charged or neutral . in order to measure specifically @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the numbers of neutral and charged d mesons recoiling against a reconstructed d meson , and the type of the d meson from which the @xmath2 mesons come , must be determined . to this end",
    "two methods have been developed and are used to measure the inclusive branching fractions of the d mesons .      to measure inclusive @xmath2 branching fractions of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons ,",
    "the @xmath2 is searched in the recoil side against a fully reconstructed d meson , and the numbers of @xmath2 events against the @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays , n@xmath33 , n@xmath34 , are determined , which can be related via    @xmath35    @xmath36    to the branching fractions of their decays , b(@xmath37 ) and b(@xmath38 ) , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are respectively the numbers of @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays on the recoil against @xmath45 and @xmath31 tags , and @xmath46 is the detection efficiency of the @xmath2 .",
    "the values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are determined from a measurement of the total production cross - sections of ractions @xmath47 at 4.03 gev by bes@xcite .      at @xmath484.03 gev , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "pairs are produced with no additional charged tracks .",
    "charged pions arising from direct d@xmath51 decays are very slow , and are mostly undetected in the bes detector . as a result ,",
    "only decay products of the @xmath32 and @xmath31 are visible for most events .",
    "let q@xmath52 be the charm flavor of the reconstructed d meson , and q@xmath53 be the total charge of tracks recoiling against this d meson .",
    "the q@xmath53 distribution for d@xmath6 ( d@xmath7 ) centers at 0 ( 1 ) , and has a spread of @xmath541 .",
    "the recoil charge method selects neutral and charged d mesons according to    @xmath55    and @xmath56 for inclusive d decays , the efficiency and the misidentification rate are 0.74@xmath540.02 and 0.25@xmath540.02 , respectively , as obtained from monte carlo simulations , and are approximately the same for both charged and neutral d mesons .",
    "these numbers are confirmed using kinematically selected data events @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for events in which a d tag and a recoil @xmath2 has been fully reconstructed , the efficiency of the recoil charge method is improved over that of the inclusive d events .",
    "a monte carlo study of various d decay modes into final states containing a @xmath2 has been performed , and the variations among their efficiencies are included in the systematic errors . for these events ,",
    "the recoil charge method selects d meson type correctly 0.91@xmath540.01@xmath540.02 of the time , and misidentifies a d for 0.09@xmath540.01@xmath540.02 of the events , where the first error is due to monte carlo statistics , and the second is systematic .",
    "charged tracks are required to have good helix fits which have a normalized chi - square of less than 9 per degree of freedom .",
    "these tracks must satisfy @xmath59 0.8 , where @xmath60 is the polar angle , and be consistent with coming from the primary event vertex . for charged particles ,",
    "a particle identification procedure is applied . a combined particle confidence level calculated using the and tof measurements",
    "is required to be greater than @xmath61 for the @xmath62 hypothesis . for the kaon hypothesis , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the likelihood for a particle type , is required .",
    "charged and neutral d mesons are reconstructed via decays @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . to reduce combinatorial backgrounds , only d mesons from @xmath68 reactions are selected with cuts on the momenta of kn@xmath62 combinations .",
    "figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) and 1(c ) show the invariant mass distributions for events that pass the selections .",
    "the signals are fitted , and after having accounted for double counting , the number of d events is determined to be @xmath69 , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "these d events are used as tagged @xmath68 events in which the recoil side contain an unbiased @xmath70 decay .",
    "5.0 truein    -.2 cm    table 1 summarizes the numbers of neutral and charged d mesons in the recoil against the reconstructed d tags .",
    "the averages from the cdtm method and the recoil charge method , calculated assuming a full correlation between their statistical errors , are 6803@xmath54303@xmath54322 and 2251@xmath5477@xmath54112 for d@xmath6 and d@xmath7 , respectively .",

    "subtracting backgrounds estimated using the @xmath2 and d side bands , the two methods determine 3.7@xmath544.7 ( cdtm ) and 9.7@xmath544.2 ( recoil charge ) @xmath81 events , and 6.5@xmath545.5 ( cdtm ) , and 0.5@xmath541.7 ( recoil charge ) @xmath82 events , respectively . averaging over the two methods and assuming a complete correlation in their statistical errors , the number of @xmath81 and @xmath82 events are set to be 6.7@xmath544.5 , and 3.5@xmath543.6 , respectively , and are used to determine their branching fractions .",
    "5.0 truein    -.2 cm      among the 15 @xmath2 candidates observed in the recoil side of the events , 4 are accompanied by at least one charged track which are within @xmath84 . each of these tracks is checked for consistency with being an electron using the information .",
    "this electron identification requires that electron confidence level to be greater than @xmath61 , and @xmath85 .",
    "none of the accompanying tracks is identified as an electron .",
    "assuming 10.2@xmath544.0 signal @xmath86 events , and correcting for @xmath2 meson detection efficiency of 0.084@xmath540.006 obtained from a monte carlo simulation , the average branching fraction for the bes mixture of d@xmath6 and d@xmath7 mesons is measured to be    @xmath87    where the first errors are statistical and second systematic .    based on 6.7@xmath544.5 @xmath81 and 3.5@xmath543.6 @xmath82 events , as determined in the previous section , 90% c. l. upper limits are set on specific d@xmath6",

    "@xmath89    the results include systematic errors arising from uncertainties ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) in the numbers of singly tagged d mesons due to the choice of a background function and fit interval for the single tag samples and uncertainties ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) in the inclusive @xmath2 efficiency .",
    "the combined effect of these sources is obtained by adding the uncertainties in quadrature , which yields total systematic errors of @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 for the d@xmath6 , d@xmath7 , and their sum , respectively .",
    "based on zero candidate @xmath98 events , and a detection efficiency of 0.0652 , a 90% c. l. limit is set for the decays at    @xmath99",
    "in summary , the inclusive branching fractions of the charged and neutral d mesons into a @xmath2 have been directly measured . comparing with the sums of the existing measurements on the exclusive @xmath100 and @xmath45 decays containing a @xmath2 in the final states ,",
