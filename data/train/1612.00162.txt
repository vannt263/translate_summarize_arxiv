    "wave interaction problems are of great interest from a theoretical point of view as well as for possible applications in applied sciences . in this framework ,",
    "a prominent role has been played by model evolution equations whose canonical structure allows for exact solutions describing relevant wave profiles as it happens for @xmath0 hyperbolic systems involving two dependent and two independent variables .",
    "as well known , these mathematical models can be recast into a form expressing the evolution of a privileged set of field variables ( riemann invariants ) along the related characteristic curves . moreover , in the homogeneous case , the quasilinear system can be reduced to linear form through the classical hodograph transformation which , in principle , can be solved by using the riemann method @xcite . therefore @xmath1 homogeneous models represent a prototype for determining classes of systems whose canonical structure allows for exact solutions that facilitate a full understanding of the interaction process of hyperbolic waves . furthermore , for such a kind of models , the wave dynamics is only ruled by the behaviour of the solutions along the associated families of characteristic curves and , by making use of the special class of simple wave solutions @xcite , it is possible to understand in detail the role played by different families of characteristic curves inside the interaction region .",
    "within such a theoretical framework , the riemann method was extended to the nonhomogeneous case in @xcite and a large new classes of solutions to quasilinear systems of pdes have been obtained in @xcite . furthermore a combined use of the hodograph method and of the differential constraints technique was considered in @xcite and quite recently was used in order to study nonlinear wave interactions @xcite as well as discontinuous initial value problems @xcite for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous @xmath1 systems .    in a different way from @xmath1 models of first order pdes , for strictly hyperbolic systems involving @xmath2 dependent variables and two independent variables , the riemann invariants in general",
    "do not exist so that a detailed description of wave interactions in terms of exact and closed form solutions to initial value problems is a hard task . in such a context",
    "the construction of solutions describing regular interactions of simple waves , the conditions for the superposition of riemann waves in terms of initial data as well as the identification of the regions of interactions have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , within the latter context a remarkable role is played by homogeneous systems of hydrodynamic type with semi - hamiltonian structure which can be diagonalized in terms of suitable field variables which are , in fact , riemann invariants . actually , via the generalized hodograph method",
    "a general solution of these systems can be obtained @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the approach worked out in @xcite for @xmath1 hyperbolic systems , has been enlarged to these class of diagonalizable semi - hamiltonian homogeneous hyperbolic systems in order to perform an accurate description of the associated hyperbolic wave interaction processes .",
    "within such a theoretical framework , here our main aim is to extend to the three dimensional case the procedure proposed in @xcite for hydrodynamic models involving two independent variables .",
    "in particular we will consider the two commuting systems @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 which admit",
    "the conservation laws @xmath6 hydrodynamic type systems ( [ chrom1 ] ) and ( [ chrom2 ] ) are nothing but the chromatography system written in the lagrangian and the euler coordinates respectively .",
    "in passing we notice that the three dimensional two component quasilinear system ( [ hydro ] ) can be written in a form of a single quasilinear equation of second order in two alternative forms @xmath7 where @xmath8 or @xmath9 where @xmath10    in this paper we describe nonlinear wave interactions for a special class of solutions of the quasilinear system ( [ hydro ] ) and , in fact , we extend the study of nonlinear hyperbolic wave interactions to three dimensional case .",
    "furthermore we determine the control parameters for the simple wave deformation in the interaction region in terms of the initial / boundary conditions .",
    "the explicit evaluation of such parameters has proved to be a useful tool for describing special ( soliton - like ) simple wave interactions @xcite as well as to perform quantitative measures or predictions of interest to engineering applications @xcite .    in particular , we will focus our attention on the two commuting hydrodynamic type systems ( [ chrom1 ] ) and ( [ chrom2 ] ) , whose general solution is determined in @xcite by the generalized hodograph method @xmath11 which characterizes , through ( [ a - b ] ) , a special class of exact solutions to ( [ hydro ] ) useful for describing nonlinear @xmath12 wave interactions . in ( [ sol ] ) @xmath13 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ inivalue ] the general solution ( [ sol ] ) is rewritten in terms of the characteristic parameters associated to the characteristic curves of the systems ( [ chrom1 ] ) , ( [ chrom2 ] ) and the explicit expression of the functions @xmath14 there involved , in terms of the initial / boundary data , is obtained . in section [ nwave ] a detailed analytical description of two different @xmath12 wave",
    "interaction problems is presented .",
    "then , in order to validate the analytical results there obtained , in section [ numerical ] , corresponding numerical integrations of ( [ hydro ] ) are shown .",
    "some final comments are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "here our aim is to calculate the functions @xmath15 involved in the general solution ( [ sol ] ) once initial / boundary conditions are given . such a result will be useful in the next section in order to study nonlinear @xmath16 wave interactions described by ( [ chrom1 ] ) , ( [ chrom2 ] ) and in turn , through ( [ a - b ] ) , admitted by ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "first we consider an arbitrary initial / boundary value problem .",
    "let @xmath17 be a smooth curve in the euclidean space of the independent variables @xmath18 @xmath19 and we assume the following boundary data for @xmath20 @xmath21 following a procedure outilined in @xcite , from ( [ sol ] ) evaluated on @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath23 therefore it is straightforward to ascertain that multiplying by @xmath24 the corresponding equation of the set ( [ ini2 ] ) , by taking the sum over @xmath25 , a further integration allows us to express @xmath26 in terms of @xmath27 as follows @xmath28 along with @xmath29    by inserting the expressions ( [ iint ] ) into relations ( [ ini2 ] ) for @xmath30 , multiplying each equation by @xmath31 , taking the sum over @xmath32 and integrating the resulting relation we are able to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "whereupon a further iterative procedure gives rise to @xmath34 where @xmath35 are obtained from @xmath36 with @xmath37 finally , from ( [ a - h ] ) , after some algebra , the function @xmath38 are determined in terms of the boundary data ( [ inicurve ] ) , ( [ ini1 ] )    @xmath39    @xmath40 in ( [ wavelets11 ] ) , ( [ wavelets22 ] ) and in what follows the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the indicated argument .",
    "next , we make use of the general expressions ( [ wavelets11 ] ) , ( [ wavelets22 ] ) in order to describe nonlinear wave interactions prescribed by the quasilinear system ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "first of all , being solution ( [ sol ] ) implicitily expressed in terms of the functions @xmath41 which remain constant along the appropriate characteristic curves @xmath42 of the system ( [ chrom1 ] ) , ( [ chrom2 ] ) , we introduce the characteristic parameters @xmath43 which are ruled by the following equations @xmath44 so that @xmath45 const on its own characteristic .",
    "therefore , bearing in mind the properties of @xmath46 quasilinear hyperbolic systems @xcite , let us assume @xmath47 which allows to obtain classes of solutions representing superposition of simple waves @xcite .",
    "such solutions are of particular interest from a physical point of view because they cover a wide range of wave phenomena arising in gas dynamics , electrodynamics , chemical engineering , etc . @xcite . therefore ,",
    "owing to ( [ omegak ] ) , the general solution ( [ sol ] ) can be expressed in terms of the characteristic parameters @xmath48 as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 and , given a function @xmath51 , we denote @xmath52 now , in view of investigating initial / boundary value problems associated to ( [ chrom1 ] ) and ( [ chrom2 ] ) ( i. e. to ( [ charact ] ) ) , although the qualitative features apply to the general case , for simplicity we normalize @xmath48 as follows @xmath53 so that , taking ( [ omegak ] ) into account , the initial / boundary data ( [ inicurve ] ) , ( [ ini1 ] ) for @xmath54 take the form @xmath55 and , from ( [ wavelets11 ] ) , ( [ wavelets22 ] ) , the arbitrary functions @xmath56 as well as @xmath57 specialize as follows    @xmath58    @xmath59    therefore , once the initial / boundary data ( [ inidata ] ) are specified , insertion of ( [ wavelets1 ] ) and ( [ wavelets2 ] ) into ( [ wavelets ] ) allows us to investigate in detail the evolution of the resulting wave pulses . finally we remark that , although smooth initial data are prescribed , the solution of quasilinear hyperbolic systems are subject to nonlinear breakdown @xcite so that our analysis will be valid until the blow up of the solution along the characteristic curves @xmath60 does not occur . more precisely , if the initial / boundary data are choosen small enough on a region of the @xmath61plane , then there exists a space interval @xmath62 $ ] in which the gradient catastrophe for solutions of the hydrodynamic type system ( [ chrom1])-([chrom2 ] ) does not occur @xcite .    under this assumption",
    "it is possible to select the initial / boundary data ( [ inidata ] ) in such a way that every characteristic @xmath63 has a tangent plane with inclination ( measured with respect to the positive direction of the @xmath64axis ) smaller than any characteristic of the family @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "in such a case , owing to the invariance of @xmath41 along the associated characteristic curve @xmath60 , it is straightforward to ascertain that if we consider initial / boundary data ( [ inidata ] ) with compact support then the @xmath66space of indipendent variables will be divided into disjoint regions of constant states , simple waves and collision regions @xcite . within this analytical framework , in the next section , two different interaction processes will be described and the resulting regions highlighted .",
    "the aim of this section is to give an exact quantitative description of nonlinear @xmath12 wave interactions prescribed by ( [ wavelets ] ) along with ( [ wavelets1 ] ) and ( [ wavelets2 ] ) .",
    "therefore let us consider the initial / boundary data @xmath67 where @xmath68 are real numbers , @xmath69 are smooth functions and @xmath70 @xmath71 are arbitrary constants . in passing we notice that the initial / boundary value problem ( [ rho_k ] ) describes @xmath12 waves localized at @xmath72 in the interval @xmath73 $ ] which , according to ( [ charact ] ) , propagate through regions which are adjacent to constant states so that the pulses in point after a finite space @xmath74 separate themselves and become in fact simple waves .",
    "it results that in the @xmath75space there are @xmath16 distinct simple wave regions @xmath76 ( see figure [ dinteract1 ] and figure [ dinteract3 ] where , for the sake of simplicity , the cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 are shown , respectively , in the plane @xmath79constant and in @xmath80space ) where each characteristic parameter @xmath81 can be explicitly calculated so that , once the initial / boundary data ( [ rho_k ] ) are specified , by using ( [ wavelets ] ) the behaviour of the emerging simple waves can be fully investigated .    in particular , for a fixed value @xmath32 , the simple wave travelling along the characteristic curve @xmath82 corresponds to the region @xmath83 and from ( [ wavelets ] ) , ( [ wavelets1 ] ) , ( [ wavelets2 ] ) and ( [ rho_k ] ) , after some algebra , we obtain the characteristic wave parameters in each simple wave region @xmath76 @xmath84 t \\rbrace   = \\alpha _ { k}+\\lambda _ { k}\\left ( \\alpha _ { k}\\right ) \\label{i}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 are given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 the interaction terms @xmath85 represent a quantitative  measure  of the distortion of the simple wave travelling along @xmath88 which depends on the initial / boundary data ( [ rho_k ] ) and vanish if there is only the localized pulse travelling along @xmath89 , that is @xmath90 next we are interested in studying the interaction between @xmath91 waves and a single pulse initially localized in disjoint intervals .",
    "therefore we consider the following initial / boundary data @xmath92 where @xmath93 denote real constants , @xmath94 are smooth functions and @xmath95 are arbitrary constants . in such a case the pulse travelling along",
    "the characteristic curve @xmath96 traverses region @xmath97 where it is a simple wave , interacts with the pulses travelling along the @xmath89 ( @xmath98 ) characteristic curves and emerges in region @xmath99 as simple wave ( see figure [ dinteract2 ] for @xmath100 ) .    in the @xmath101space",
    "there are @xmath102 distinct simple wave regions where each characteristic parameter @xmath103 can be explicitly calculated ( see figure [ dinteract4 ] for @xmath78 ) .",

    "such a theoretical problem was usually considered for two - dimensional hyperbolic models @xcite , while , in the case of more space variables , for special evolution processes ruled by an auxiliary @xmath172 hyperbolic subsystem @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of the procedure at hand is the existence of @xmath12 riemann invariants for each particular hydrodynamic reduction ( see details in @xcite ) of three dimensional quasilinear system ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "therefore the method can be applied to the class of semi - hamiltonian homogeneous systems of hydrodynamic type which admit a diagonalized form @xcite . in this case",
    "a general solution can be obtained by means of the generalized hodograph method @xcite .",
    "although the study developed herein can be performed for any diagonalizable semi - hamiltonian homogeneous model which can be solved by the generalized hodograph method , the procedure was illustrated for two commuting systems ( [ chrom1 ] ) and ( [ chrom2 ] ) associated to the three dimensional system ( [ hydro ] ) .",
    "two different situations were illustrated .",
    "first we described the evolution of @xmath12 waves initially localized in a closed interval , next we studied the interaction between @xmath91 pulses and a further single wave . in both cases",
    "the resulting waves behave like simple waves and after the interaction region they are distorted . the amount of the produced distortion is analytically computed through the @xmath173 and @xmath174 terms which depend on the initial data given , respectively , by ( [ rho_k ] ) and ( [ data_3 ] ) . as it was pointed out in section [ inivalue ] ,",
    "although in section [ nwave ] we studied nonlinear wave interactions concerning the examples characterized by the initial / boundary conditions ( [ rho_k ] ) and ( [ data_3 ] ) , we remark that our procedure can be in principle applied to describe hyperbolic nonlinear wave interactions corresponding to any set of initial / boundary data .    finally ,",
    "in order to validate the analytical results herein obtained , the numerical integration of the governing system ( [ hydro ] ) was performed .",
    "the resulting three dimensional figures confirm the behaviours which have been analytically described by means of the proposed procedure .",
