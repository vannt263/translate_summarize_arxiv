    "a legendrian knot in the standard contact space @xmath0 defines an integer , called thurston - bennequin number , via its framing .",
    "the maximal thurston - bennequin number of a knot is obtained by maximizing this integer over all legendrian representatives of that knot .",
    "precise values of the maximal thurston - bennequin number are known for some special classes of knots , such as positive knots or two - bridge knots ( @xcite , @xcite ) . given a link @xmath1 with two components ,",
    "we may ask which pairs of integers can be realised as framings of a legendrian representative .",
    "the convex hull of these pairs of integers defines a polytope in @xmath2 , which we call the thurston - bennequin polytope @xmath3 of the link @xmath4 . as an example , the thurston - bennequin polytope of the negative torus link of type @xmath5 is shown in figure  1 ( this is a special case of theorem  1 below ) .    in this note",
    "we will determine the thurston - bennequin polytope for oriented two - bridge links .",
    "our description makes use of the maximal thurston - bennequin number for oriented links , denoted by @xmath6 , and the linking number @xmath7 .",
    "however , the polytope itself does not depend on orientation .",
    "let @xmath4 be a two - bridge link with two components @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the thurston - bennequin polytope of @xmath4 is @xmath10 moreover , every integer point of @xmath3 is realised by a legendrian framing .",
    "theorem  1 has an interesting application concerning quasipositive surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "quasipositive surfaces can be defined as the minimal family of embedded surfaces in @xmath0 containing the positive hopf band ( i.e. the fibre of the positive hopf link ) , which is closed under the plumbing operation and under taking incompressible sub - surfaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "a sub - surface is called incompressible if its embedding into the ambient surface induces an injective map on the level of fundamental groups . by definition ,",
    "every incompressible sub - surface of a quasipositive surface is quasipositive .",
    "in particular , this is true for all incompressible sub - annuli .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture the converse : a surface embedded in @xmath0 is quasipositive if all its incompressible sub - annuli are . in the case of pretzel surfaces , this is true @xcite . in general , it is false",
    ".    there exist non - quasipositive connected surfaces in @xmath0 all whose incompressible sub - annuli are quasipositive",
    ".    we will construct a surface with the above properties in the third section .",
    "the next section is devoted to the proof of theorem  1 , which is based on ng s work @xcite .",
    "the standard contact structure on @xmath0 is induced by the 1-form @xmath11 .",
    "as mentioned above , a legendrian knot has a natural framing induced by the contact planes .",
    "the thurston - bennequin number is defined as the linking number of the link induced by that framing . in order to define the thurston - bennequin number for oriented links , it is convenient to introduce the front projection of links , i.e. the orthogonal projection to the @xmath12-@xmath13-plane .",
    "front projections of legendrian links contain cusps , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "the thurston - bennequin number @xmath14 of an oriented legendrian link @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the writhe ( i.e. the algebraic crossing number ) and the number of cusps of the front diagram @xmath19 of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "for example , the thurston - bennequin number of the legendrian link of figure  2 is @xmath21 or @xmath22 , depending on the choice of orientation .",
    "let @xmath23 be a legendrian representative of a link @xmath4 with two components @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the following equality is an immediate consequence of the above definition : @xmath24 therefore , if a pair of integers @xmath25 is induced by a legendrian framing of @xmath4 , then the following three inequalities hold : @xmath26    let @xmath4 be a two - bridge link with components @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "since these components are unknotted , we have @xmath27 theorem  1 is settled once we have shown that every integer point on the diagonal line segment with endpoints @xmath28 , @xmath29 is realised by a legendrian framing . indeed ,",
    "if a pair of integers @xmath25 is realised , then so are the pairs @xmath30 and @xmath31 , by simple stabilisations .",
    "two - bridge links admit a description by finite continued fractions . in  @xcite ,",
    "ng proves that every two - bridge link has a diagram corresponding to an alternating continued fraction @xmath32=a_1+\\frac{1}{-a_2+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{(-1)^{n-1}a_n}}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 , for all @xmath34 . these diagrams in turn define a canonical front projection @xmath35 , called legendrian rational front , as illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a rational front projection for a legendrian representative @xmath20 of the link @xmath4 . according to ng",
    ", @xmath19 realises the maximal thurston - bennequin number of @xmath4 .",
    "we observe that the upper component of @xmath19 , say @xmath37 , has thurston - bennequin number @xmath38 , so the corresponding point of the thurston - bennequin polytope has coordinates @xmath39 .",
    "we will gradually move from this point along the diagonal line towards the point @xmath29 , via a suitable family of legendrian front diagrams .",
    "first we will arrange all the numbers @xmath40 corresponding to self - crossings of the lower component @xmath41 to be even .",
    "for this purpose we use the fact that the value of a continued fraction is preserved if we replace a segment of the form @xmath42 by the segment @xmath43 and change the signs of all subsequent coefficients , provided @xmath44 .",
    "this replacement can be done independently at all self - crossings ( note that if @xmath40 corresponds to self - crossings of @xmath41 , then @xmath45 does not ) . however , this produces a non - alternating continued fraction : the crossings corresponding to coefficients @xmath46 carry the wrong sign .",
    "we may still associate a front diagram to this fraction by introducing a so - called zig - zag to the component @xmath41 at all single crossings with the wrong sign .",
    "figure  3 shows the two possible ways of introducing a zig - zag at a crossing .",
    "in this manner we obtain a front diagram @xmath47 which still maximises the thurston - bennequin number of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact all three numbers @xmath14 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the same for both diagrams @xmath19 , @xmath47 .",
    "this follows from  ( [ tb_def ] ) and the fact that all self - crossings of @xmath41 are negative ( the increase in the writhe from @xmath19 to @xmath47 equals the number of cancelled self - crossing of @xmath41 and is therefore neutralised by the additional pairs of cusps ) .    next we wish to modify @xmath47 so that the number of self - crossings of @xmath41 between the lower two strands is at least as high as the number of self - crossings of @xmath41 between the middle two strands .",
    "if this is not yet the case , we may simply turn the diagram @xmath47 upside down and drag the lower strand to the top , see figure  4 . again , this operation does not affect the numbers @xmath14 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    at last , we will describe two kinds of operations on the diagram @xmath47 that do change the numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    1 .",
    "replace a zig - zag on the component @xmath41 by a zig - zag on the component @xmath37 , ( compare figure  3 ) .",
    "this operation changes the thurston - bennequin numbers of @xmath37 and @xmath41 by @xmath38 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "replace two consecutive self - crossings of @xmath41 at the lower level by two consecutive self - crossings of @xmath37 at the upper level , as shown in figure  5 .",
    "this operation corresponds to a double flype , but not to a legendrian isotopy of front diagrams .",
    "in fact the thurston - bennequin numbers of @xmath37 and @xmath41 change by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "+    @xmath50    these two operations allow us to remove at least half the number of self - crossings of the component @xmath41 .",
    "hence we can realise all integer points up to the midpoint on the diagonal line segment between the points @xmath28 , @xmath29 of the thurston - bennequin polytope of the link @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude by remarking that every two - bridge link admits a symmetry that interchanges the two link components .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the thurston - bennequin polytope of a two - component link can always be described by three linear inequalities , and whether all its integer points are realised by legendrian framings .",
    "we do not know the answer to these questions .",
    "however , there do exist links whose thurston - bennequin polytope has an even simpler shape : positive braid links . according to bennequin  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) , every positive braid link has a natural legendrian representative whose thurston - bennequin number is maximal and equals the number of crossings minus the number of strands of the braid .",
    "moreover , the thurston - bennequin number of every single component of that representative is maximal .",
    "thus the thurston - bennequin polytope of a two - component positive braid link is described by two inequalities , only : @xmath54 the same is evidently true for all two - component split links .",
    "originally , a surface embedded in @xmath0 was called quasipositive , if it was isotopic to a certain positively braided surface .",
    "rudolph s characterisation results say that quasipositivity of surfaces is inherited by incompressible sub - surfaces and is preserved under the plumbing operation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , every quasipositive surface can be embedded incompressibly on the fibre surface of a torus link .",
    "the latter are plumbings of finitely many positive hopf bands .",
    "the following definition is therefore justified .      an alternative definition for quasipositivity was recently formulated in the setting of contact geometry @xcite",
    ": quasipositive surfaces are precisely the legendrian ribbons in the standard contact @xmath0 . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to know that every legendrian link defines a legendrian ribbon , by replacing its components by disjoint annuli with the obvious framings .",
    "we will construct an embedded surface , starting from the legendrian ribbon associated to the front projection shown in figure  6 .",
    "this front realises the maximal thurston - bennequin number of the corresponding link ( the negative torus link of type @xmath55 ) , by ng @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if we remove the full twist encircled in figure  6 , we obtain a surface , say @xmath56 , which is not a legendrian ribbon , hence a non - quasipositive surface .",
    "nevertheless , both incompressible sub - annuli of @xmath56 are obviously quasipositive .",
    "connecting these two sub - annuli by a small band , as shown at the top of figure  7 , we obtain a connected surface @xmath57 , which is again non - quasipositive , since it contains @xmath56 as an incompressible sub - surface .",
    "we claim that all incompressible sub - annuli of @xmath57 are quasipositive .",
    "every incompressible sub - annulus of @xmath57 is parallel to the boundary of @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the topological type of the surface @xmath57 is a pair of pants , thus the core curve of an incompressible sub - annulus divides @xmath57 into a pair of pants and an annulus .",
    "we already checked the quasipositivity for two sub - annuli of @xmath57 .",
    "the third sub - annulus is shown at the bottom of figure  7 .",
    "it is manifestly a legendrian ribbon , hence quasipositive ."
