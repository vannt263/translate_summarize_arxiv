    "measurements of hadron production in e@xmath5e@xmath6 annihilation are important to understand the fragmentation process of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "perturbation theory can not be applied to describe this process and the theoretical description is based on phenomenological models as implemented , for example , in the jetset  @xcite , herwig  @xcite or ariadne  @xcite monte carlo generators .",
    "recently , two analytical models have been proposed to describe the hadron production rates in e@xmath5e@xmath6 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the model of reference  @xcite , referred to from here on as the `` string - based model , '' is derived partially from string fragmentation and describes the production of light mesons and baryons using the simple formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of primary hadrons of spin @xmath9 , containing @xmath10 strange quarks , produced directly by string fragmentation .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is the hadron binding energy : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are constituent quark masses , and @xmath14 is the effective temperature of hadronization in this model .",
    "the overall normalization of the rate is controlled by @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath15 with center - of - mass energy is predicted by perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is a universal suppression factor for strange quark production , while @xmath17 is a suppression factor of baryon production relative to meson production .",
    "this model has five free parameters : @xmath15 at some fixed energy scale , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 , the mass difference between strange and up quarks .",
    "the model of reference  @xcite , referred to from here on as the `` hadron gas model , '' is based on thermodynamical considerations and has three adjustable parameters : the total volume @xmath19 of the hadron gas , a strangeness suppression factor similar to @xmath16 in reference  @xcite , and the hadronization temperature @xmath14 . in the hadron gas model , no additional parameters are needed to reproduce the relative production rate of baryons versus mesons .",
    "both of these models give a good description of the full spectrum of light hadron production in addition to predicting the rates for strange baryons .",
    "the string - based model also describes well the relative production rate of hadrons containing b and c quarks . in order to compare the experimental data to these two analytical models which predict primary hadron production , the observed rate",
    "must first be corrected for two effects : ( i ) hadrons containing quarks produced in the primary electroweak interaction , ( ii ) ` feed - down ' due to the decays of unstable hadrons produced in string fragmentation  @xcite or , correspondingly , the phase change that produces the hadron gas  @xcite .",
    "the feed - down correction is made using known hadron branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 strange baryons produced in hadronic z decays at center - of - mass energies in the range @xmath20  , from 71.1  pb@xmath21 of data collected by the l3 detector during the lep running periods of 1994 and 1995 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryons provide a good test of the hadron rate models because of their relatively low feed - down correction as compared to the lighter p and @xmath22 baryons .",
    "the use of the decay modes which have photons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , enable the measurements to be made down to low baryon momenta due to the low - energy photon detection capability of the l3 detector .",
    "a detailed description of the l3 detector and its performance is given in reference  @xcite .",
    "this analysis makes use of the electromagnetic calorimeter made of bismuth germanate  ( bgo ) crystals , which accurately identifies and measures photons from an energy of 50   to 200  . in order to benefit from the low - energy photon detection of the calorimeter ,",
    "its performance was studied and parameterized  @xcite .",
    "the resulting resolution functions are shown in figure  [ fig : bgores ] .",
    "in addition , corrections due to electronic noise and calibration accuracy are taken into account .",
    "the electronic noise terms are @xmath23 with @xmath24   and @xmath25 with @xmath26   where @xmath27 is the mean intrinsic noise per channel and @xmath28 is the mean correlated noise per channel , and @xmath29 is the number of crystals used to compute the shower energy .",
    "the calibration accuracy term for 1994 and 1995 is @xmath30 with @xmath31 as estimated from bhabha events .",
    "these terms are added in quadrature to the resolution functions of figure  [ fig : bgores ] .",
    "the inclusive production rate measurements are based on a selection of hadronic z decays which have a measured primary vertex .",
    "a precise measurement of the primary vertex in all three dimensions is achieved in more than 99% of all hadronic events .",
    "the hadronic selection requires a well - balanced , high particle - multiplicity event with the full collision energy measured by the detector and relies on the following criteria :    * the total energy observed in the detector , including the momenta of muons measured in the muon spectrometer , @xmath32 , is restricted to the range @xmath33 . * the energy imbalance along the beam direction , @xmath34 ,",
    "must satisfy @xmath35 . * the transverse energy imbalance , @xmath36 , with respect to the beam direction ,",
    "must satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "* the number of energy clusters reconstructed in the calorimeters is required to be larger than 12 .",
    "a data set of 1.6 million hadronic z decays was selected for this analysis .",
    "the events passing the hadronic event selection are analyzed for the inclusive production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the decay modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the p@xmath40 and @xmath41 mass distributions are computed , and a fitting procedure is applied to count the number of selected candidates in the mass peak .",
    "the anti - particles of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are included in the corresponding distributions to increase the statistical significance of the data samples .",
    "central to the selections of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 candidates are the kinematical constraints describing their decay .",
    "a probability is assigned to each candidate based on the minimum @xmath42 which satisfies the decay constraints .",
    "the @xmath42 has the form : @xmath43 where the number of charged - particle tracks and electromagnetic clusters used to reconstruct the decay are respectively @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; @xmath46 is the vector of measured parameters for the @xmath47 track and @xmath48 the corresponding covariance matrix ; @xmath49 are the fit parameters assuming the track originated from the secondary vertex @xmath50 with momentum @xmath51 ; @xmath52 is the event - vertex with covariance matrix @xmath19 ; @xmath53 is the fit to the production vertex ; @xmath54 is the vector of measured parameters for the @xmath47 electromagnetic cluster with covariance matrix @xmath55 ; and @xmath56 are the fit parameters assuming that a photon originated from the secondary vertex @xmath50 with momentum @xmath51 .",
    "the details of the constrained fitting technique are found in reference  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the constraint probability cuts , other selection criteria are also applied to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "the fitting procedure of the invariant mass distributions consists of several steps .",
    "the jetset monte carlo simulation is used to predict the shape of the p@xmath40 and @xmath41 mass distributions separately for the background and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals .",
    "the monte carlo signal and background distributions are binned into histograms which are then smoothed with a spline fit .",
    "the spline fit reduces background fluctuations in the signal region by interpolating between the sidebands of the signal .",
    "the use of binned histograms with bin widths comparable to the expected mass resolution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals is found to be optimal for exploiting the histogram shape differences between signal and background .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit is performed for both the signal and the background normalizations , simultaneously .",
    "the likelihood is constructed by computing the poisson probability for each bin and then making the product over all bins in the histogram , as follows , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the total number of signal and background events , @xmath60 is the number of observed data events in a given bin and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the number of expected events in a given bin for signal and background , respectively .",
    "the production rates of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are determined by a kinematic extrapolation which assumes the jetset monte carlo production distributions .",
    "the signature of a @xmath63 decay is a single charged track and two photons measured in the calorimeter as shown in figure  [ fig : kinem]a .",

    "the @xmath42 is obtained from equation  ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) .",
    "the computation of the constraint probability requires the accurate description of the photon resolution in energy and angle in the calorimeter .",
    "the selection of @xmath0 candidates consists of the following cuts :    * the constraint probability , @xmath73 , must be larger than 0.2 .",
    "* the energies of the two photons must be greater than @xmath74   and their polar angle must be in the bgo barrel acceptance ( @xmath75 ) . *",
    "the @xmath40 boost , @xmath76 , is required to be larger than 2.0 . *",
    "the transverse momentum of the proton must exceed 800  . * the transverse decay radius , @xmath77 , of the @xmath0 is required to be in the range @xmath78  mm ensuring the decay to be inside the inner radius of the silicon microvertex detector ( smd ) .",
    "* charged tracks which are identified as coming from @xmath22 or k@xmath79 decay are rejected as proton candidates from @xmath0 decay .",
    "figure  [ fig : newsp ] shows the mass distribution of the selected @xmath80 candidates .",
    "the number of selected @xmath2 decays determined by the fit is found to be 342 @xmath81 33 .",
    "the @xmath1 is measured in the decay mode @xmath3 .",
    "this mode accounts for nearly 100% of the @xmath1 branching fractions .",
    "identification of the @xmath22 is done using the @xmath82 decay mode .",
    "the proton is assumed to be the track with the highest momentum of the two tracks forming the @xmath22 candidate .",
