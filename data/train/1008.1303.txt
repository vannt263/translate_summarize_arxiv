    "for these set of parameters which approximate the experimental data @xcite we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_shift ] the phase shift of field b due to cross phase modulation with field a. the results demonstrate clearly that it is possible to achieve all the requirements of : low losses , large confinement , large kerr nonlinear coefficient and cross phase shift of order @xmath3 .",
    "finally we note that with the nonlinear @xmath3 phase shift , the llsp pulses can be easily separated at the output from each other in real experiment if the input two llsp pulses are characterized by different polarizations ( i.e. , for tm and te llsp pulses ) . whereas the analysis presented here",
    "pertains to the solid system pr : ysio , the low loss sp and their high confinement together with double eit scheme is also applicable to gaseous system like @xmath169 with appropriate choice of parameters @xcite .",
    "we have studied electric and magnetic surface polaritons in half space metamaterial in contact with a dielectric . we have demonstrated the possibility of slow low loss sp fields with small longitudinal spatial size of the sp pulse and highly reduced group velocity .",
    "thus the proposed scheme has a large potential for the quantum control of the sp - fields , and applications in compact quantum memory devices  @xcite localized near the surface of mate - materials .",
    "we have discussed only few possibilities of the sp field control that indicate the rich physical parameters that can be used in order to realize the most convenient conditions that suit particular applications of this scheme . in particular it would be interesting to analyze promising possibilities determined by the other types of geometry of the interface , as well as by using another spectral properties of the atomic systems and interaction with varied intensive control laser fields .",
    "also we anticipate to find interesting possibilities for the sp field control for the atomic systems characterized by another spatial densities , in particular with periodic density modulation along the sp field propagation .    as we have found above , combining sp fields at nimm interface with the deit mechanism yields the trifecta for large cross - phase modulation .",
    "these three sought - after properties are low loss , high field confinement , and large kerr coefficients .",
    "the goal is to reach mutual phase shifts of  @xmath3 at the single - photon level , which would have profound implications for quantum information technology .",
