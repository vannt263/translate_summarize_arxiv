    "there is a great deal of work being done to reduce artifacts in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "this is important , if one aims to extract precise continuum physics on the emerging teraflop - range computers .",
    "we will focus here on the improvement of the pure gauge sector @xcite .",
    "the general form of the action that we try is @xmath3 for @xmath4 one recovers the wilson action .",
    "the additional wilson loops are six - link loops in two and three dimensions ( excluding the bent rectangle which is redundant to order @xmath5 ) .",
    "a `` good '' improved action should reduce lattice artifacts and should be practical for computations .",
    "therefore , one would like to have as little as possible additional terms in the action .",
    "classically , at order @xmath5 , a convenient choice is @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "corrections of these values at leading order in bare coupling amount to a small nonvanishing @xmath8 .",
    "recently , it was observed that an expansion in a renormalized coupling @xcite produces an impressive improvement of the classical values .",
    "a different strategy to select couplings is to compute them by performing renormalization group ( rg ) transformations .",
    "ideally , one could construct fixed point ( fp ) or `` perfect '' actions @xcite . for computational convenience ,",
    "we prefer rg improved actions which are less complex @xcite .",
    "one earlier approach has blocked continuum gauge fields by expanding in the bare coupling @xcite .",
    "more recently , by blocking lattice gauge fields during a monte carlo simulation ( mcrg ) , one has constructed improved gauge actions @xcite .",
    "since a thorough study of scaling with the mcrg improved gauge actions is missing , we decided to investigate this problem .",
    "( the corresponding study with the iwasaki action can be found in @xcite . ) as we will see rg improved actions lead to a better restoration of rotational symmetry than mean field improved actions .",
    "therefore we decided to study also the scaling properties with the mcrg improved action .",
    "in the table below we give the simulation parameters with improved gauge actions on small lattices .        provided the fermion action is improved at the same order , this result shows that one could compute the spectrum in quenched qcd already on a @xmath11 space volume amounting to a lattice size @xmath12 fm .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results of hadron spectroscopy on @xmath13 blocked configurations used to determine the mcrg improved action @xcite .",
    "note that the same accuracy with the wilson gauge and fermion action has been achieved on @xmath14 lattices .",
    "_ therefore , these results together with those in @xcite strongly suggest that one could perform phenomenological lattice calculation runs in the quenched approximation with sufficient accuracy ( @xmath15 level ) on lattices with @xmath16 points in each dimension .",
    "_        we have tested asymptotic scaling too . in figure 3",
    "we show @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "it can be seen that a saturation seems to start already at @xmath19 . in figure 4",
    "we plot the discrete beta - function based on the string tension results .",
    "the results obtained up to now are not yet conclusive for the onset of asymptotic scaling . at present",
    "we are running simulations at higher @xmath18s on @xmath20 lattices and at the same time we are increasing the statistics .",
    "the results will reveal the behavior of the discrete @xmath18-function deep in the perturbative region @xcite ."
