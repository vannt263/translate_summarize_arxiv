    "the study of soliton and black hole solutions of the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) equations has been an active subject for some twenty - five years , triggered by the discovery of regular , static , spherically symmetric , solitons @xcite and `` coloured '' black holes @xcite in @xmath2 eym in four - dimensional asymptotically flat space - time . in these configurations ,",
    "the nonabelian gauge field is purely magnetic @xcite and described by a single function @xmath4 of the radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "numerical investigations @xcite show that @xmath4 must have at least one zero , and this is has also been proven analytically @xcite .",
    "both the particle - like and black hole solutions arise at discrete points in the phase space of parameters , and can be indexed by @xmath6 , the number of zeros of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath2 solitons and black holes have no magnetic charge at infinity .",
    "the black holes , in particular , are indistinguishable from a schwarzschild black hole at infinity , and therefore present counter - examples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture @xcite . however , both the black hole and soliton solutions are unstable under linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations of the gauge field and metric @xcite . as a consequence of this ,",
    "bizon postulated a modified `` no - hair '' conjecture @xcite , heuristically stated as `` a stable black hole is uniquely characterized by global charges '' .",
    "the `` coloured '' black holes do not contradict this conjecture due to their instability .",
    "notwithstanding the instability of the @xmath2 eym solitons and black holes in asymptotically flat space - time , their discovery sparked extensive research into soliton and black hole solutions of more general matter models involving nonabelian gauge fields ( see @xcite for a review ) . in four - dimensional asymptotically flat space - time , enlarging the gauge group to @xmath0 , a richer phase space arises @xcite , but solutions still occur at discrete points in the phase space .",
    "furthermore , there is a very general result that all purely magnetic , asymptotically flat , soliton or black hole solutions of the @xmath0 eym equations in four - dimensional space - time are unstable @xcite .",
    "the situation is very different if one considers eym with a negative cosmological constant @xmath7 , so that the space - time is asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) rather than asymptotically flat .",
    "four - dimensional , purely magnetic , black hole @xcite and soliton @xcite solutions of the @xmath2 eym equations in ads are found in continuous regions of parameter space rather than at discrete points as in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath8 is sufficiently large , there are solutions for which the single magnetic gauge field function @xmath4 has no zeros .",
    "these nodeless solutions have no analogue in asymptotically flat space - time and at least some of them are stable under linear , spherically symmetric perturbations @xcite . the proof of stability",
    "can be extended to general linear perturbations of the metric and gauge field providing @xmath9 is sufficiently large @xcite .    for the larger @xmath0 gauge group ,",

    "exist both soliton and black hole solutions for which all the @xmath10 have no zeros provided @xmath9 is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "these solutions are of particular interest because it can be proven that at least some of them are stable under linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations of the metric and gauge field @xcite .",
    "although these stable black holes are coupled to potentially unlimited amounts of gauge field hair , they can nonetheless be characterized by global charges defined far from the black hole @xcite , in accordance with the modified `` no - hair '' conjecture @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "returning to @xmath2 eym in ads , the space of solutions revealed another surprise @xcite . in asymptotically flat space - time , all nontrivial ( that is , not corresponding to embedded schwarzschild or abelian reissner - nordstrm configurations ) @xmath2 solitons and black holes must have gauge fields with vanishing electric parts @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in asymptotically ads space - time , with dyonic solitons and black holes existing , for which the gauge field has nontrivial electric and magnetic components @xcite . for @xmath2 gauge group ,",

    "the electric gauge field function @xmath12 is monotonic and has no zeros ; there exist solitons and black holes for which the magnetic gauge field function @xmath4 also has no zeros @xcite .",

    "we explore the phase space of dyonic eym solitons and black holes in ads when the gauge group is enlarged to @xmath0 . in the purely magnetic case , with the larger gauge group",
    "the phase space has a very rich structure @xcite and we anticipate that the same will be true for dyonic solutions .",
    "dyonic solutions of @xmath0 eym will be described by @xmath1 electric gauge field functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 magnetic gauge field functions @xmath10 , @xmath14 .",

    "black holes with a flat event horizon in particular have attracted a great deal of attention in the literature as models of holographic superconductors ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "planar black holes with a @xmath2 gauge field have been used to model @xmath345-wave superconductors ( see , for example , @xcite for a selection of papers ) , and enlarging the gauge group in these models would also be of interest .",
    "we plan to return to this topic in a future publication .",
    "finally , we anticipate that the thermodynamics of the dyonic black holes presented here would be very interesting .",
    "the thermodynamics of purely magnetic @xmath2 black holes in ads has recently been studied @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a complex picture emerges : it is found that purely magnetic , spherically symmetric @xmath2 black holes with unit magnetic charge at infinity are globally thermodynamically unstable ; those with zero magnetic charge at infinity have two branches of solutions , both of which are globally thermodynamically unstable to decay to an embedded schwarzschild - ads black hole ; while those with general magnetic charge at infinity also have two branches of solutions , one of which is thermodynamically stable .",
    "we expect that the additional complexity of both enlarging the gauge group and including an electric as well as a magnetic part of the gauge field will render the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 dyonic black holes studied in this paper to be even more complicated than that presented in @xcite for the purely magnetic @xmath2 case .",
