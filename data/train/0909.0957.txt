    "the first multiple exoplanet system was discovered in 1992 , when @xcite detected two very low - mass objects orbiting the pulsar psr b1257 + 12 using pulse timing methods .",
    "seven years later , @xcite announced the first multi - exoplanet system around a normal star from radial velocities , @xmath4 andromedae .",
    "since then , the ever - improving precision and ever - growing temporal baseline of radial velocity searches has rapidly increased the number of known multiple planet systems , and today at least 30 such systems are known .",
    "thus , this conference comes at a special time in the field of multiple planet systems : there are just few enough systems now that this is likely the last conference where each system can still plausibly be discussed individually , but there are enough such that this is the first conference where we can construct something like a statistically significant sample of planets in multiple systems to divide into subsamples or to compare with apparently single - planet systems .",
    "multiple planet systems provide an increasingly powerful way to probe the dynamical origins of planets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "single - planet systems , because their orbits are strictly periodic , provide most of their information on the typical migration and interaction histories of exoplanets statistically as an ensemble . but",
    "each individual multiple planet system has the potential to serve as a case study of planetary system evolution .",
    "i have divided the known multi - planet systems heuristically into five broad , nonexclusive categories : 1 ) systems with 3 or more giant ( @xmath0 ) planets , 2 ) systems with two giant planets in mean motion resonance , 3 ) systems with two giant planets not in mmr , but whose dynamical evolution is affected by weaker planet - planet interactions , 4 ) highly hierarchical systems , having two giant planets with very large period ratios ( @xmath5 ) , and 5 ) systems of `` super - earths '' , containing only planets with ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the summaries below represent a brief and necessarily incomplete description of each system .",
    "five systems are known to comprise three or more giant planets .",
    "@xcite announced the first multi - exoplanet system around a normal star , @xmath4 andromedae , detected using precise radial velocity measurements from lick observatory .",
    "the pattern of the discovery is typical of many multiplanet systems : after a strong , short - period signal from a 4.6 d , @xmath7 planet was discovered ( @xcite ) , continued monitoring revealed significant structure in residuals that far exceeded the expected measurement uncertainties .",
    "after 2.5 y , two additional , superimposed keplerians consistent with planets of @xmath8 and @xmath9 became apparent with periods of @xmath10 d and @xmath11 d.    interacting systems such as @xmath4 andromedae are our most powerful probes of the dynamical histories of exoplanets .",
    "to select just one example , @xcite showed how @xmath4 andromedae shows good evidence that a single , strong , planet - planet scattering event is the origin of the modest eccentricities of the outer two planets .",
    "@xcite , using velocities obtained with hires at keck observatory , detected an apparently jupiter - mass planet with @xmath12 d orbiting hd 37124 , a metal - poor g4 dwarf .",
    "further data showed significant deviations from the predicted velocities , and allowed @xcite to attempt a double - planet fit including an outer planet with @xmath13 y. @xcite showed that this fit was unstable , and further keck data revealed the reason : @xcite reported the detection of a third planet in the system , though with an ambiguity in its period .",
    "today , keck data has resolved this ambiguity .",
    "this system has been particularly difficult to unravel because the radial velocity amplitudes of the three planets are similar and their periods are long : they have @xmath14 , 840 , and 2300 d , and @xmath15 0.64 , 0.62 , and @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite find that the outermost planet s orbit is still not very well constrained , and note that in this system , planet - planet interactions are sufficiently strong that kinematic ( sum - of - keplerian ) models of the radial velocities are not sufficient to describe the system .",
    "@xcite announced a double system with planets of @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19  in 52 d and 5.5 y orbits respectively around hd 74156 from data taken with elodie at observatoire de haute provence .",
    "combining published data from elodie , coralie at la silla observatory , and new data acquired by hrs on het , @xcite announced a third , intermediate planet with @xmath20 and a period near 1 year .",
    "@xcite studied the system dynamically and found two , stable , qualitatively different solutions to the published rv data .",
    "they described the detection of the third planet as vindication of a prediction by @xcite of a planet of that mass and orbital distance based on their `` packed planetary system '' hypothesis .",
    "@xcite announced a @xmath22 d planet with 2 @xmath19  orbiting @xmath23 ara based on radial velocities from ucles on the anglo - australian telescope , and soon thereafter @xcite announced that further observations revealed a linear trend in the residuals , indicative of a long - period , outer companion .",
    "further aat observations allowed @xcite to update the fit , note that the linear trend then showed clear signs of curvature , and suggest a family of possible orbits including one with @xmath24 8.2 y and @xmath25 .    nearly simultaneously to the latter work , @xcite , using harps at la silla observatory to perform high - cadence , high - precision radial velocity work , detected a @xmath26 companion in an inner 9.6 d orbit , and confirmed the outer planet .",
    "finally , @xcite used a combination of old and new harps data and the published ucles data to detect a fourth planet with p=310 d , @xmath27 and determine good orbital parameters for the outer planet for the first time in a full , dynamical , 4-planet fit . for the outer planet they found @xmath28 and @xmath24 11.5 y , and they revised the orbit of the @xmath29 component , finding @xmath30 and @xmath24 643 d.    note that there is ambiguity in the literature regarding the nomenclature for these planets , with some authors referring to the outer planet as the @xmath31 component ( since it was the last to be characterized ) , and others referring to it as the @xmath32 component ( since it was the second to be detected ) .",
    "along with @xmath4 and @xmath29 , @xcite also announced 55 cnc @xmath29 , a `` 51 pegasi - type '' planet with @xmath34 and @xmath24 14.6 d. further lick data allowed @xcite to announce a second planet at 5 au with @xmath35 , the first extrasolar jupiter analog ( in terms of orbital distance ) .",
    "they also announced a signal from what appeared to be a third planet with @xmath36 d ( roughly three times the period of the inner planet ) and @xmath37 , but at the time stellar rotation could not be ruled out as the cause .    using a combination of new and old lick , elodie , and het velocities and hubble space telescope fine guidance sensor astrometry",
    ", @xcite confirmed the 42-d planet and announced a very low amplitude 2.8-d planet with @xmath38 , one of the first of a new class of `` hot neptunes '' .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the published radial velocity data , challenged the reality of the 2.8 d planet , and noted a weak 260-d signal possibly due to a planet with @xmath39 .    using a combination of new and old lick and keck data",
    ", @xcite found a good orbital solution for all four published planets and announced the fifth , @xmath40 , 260-d planet , making 55 cnc the first ( and , to date , only ) known quintuple planet system .",
    "they also found that despite the near - commensurability of their orbital periods , the @xmath29 and @xmath32 components are not likely in a 3:1 mean - motion resonance because a dynamical integration shows that their resonant arguments do not librate .",
    "they note that , as with hd 37124 , keplerian models are inadequate descriptions of the existing rv data , and differ from the best newtonian ( dynamical ) fits by @xmath41 25 m / s .",
    "these six systems contain two giant planets in or suggested to be in mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) . while it is difficult to understand how such planets could have formed _ in situ _",
    ", differential migration could explain how planets formed outside of resonance could become trapped in such an mmr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency and character of such mmr systems could thus be a probe of the nature of planetary migration in systems with multiple giant planets .",
    "@xcite , using data from keck observatory , and @xcite , using elodie and coralie data , nearly simultaneously announced the presence of a 61-d , @xmath42 planet orbiting gj 876 , the first known m - dwarf planet host .",
    "after 2.5 y of further observations at keck , @xcite showed that the signal was actually the superposition of signals from two planets in a 2:1 mean - motion resonance , with the inner planet having p= 30 d and @xmath43 , making gj 876 @xmath29 and @xmath32 the first system clearly shown to be in a mean motion resonance .",
    "further keck data allowed @xcite to detect a very low - amplitude , low - mass planet in a 2.6-d orbit .",
    "this mmr is so strong that the orbital elements of the planets change on timescales shorter than the span of the extant observations of the system .",
    "the arguments of periastron of the two components precess in @xmath44 y , an effect clearly seen in the radial velocities and which complicates multi - component keplerian fits . a dynamical fit of the keck velocities based on numerical integrations allowed @xcite to weakly constrain the inclination of the system and estimate the true mass of the inner planet to be @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite described their discovery of the second known pair of planets in a 2:1 mmr orbiting hd 82943 ( which had been publicly announced in 2000 and 2001 ) based on data from coralie .",
    "@xcite combined the published coralie data with new keck data to derive a dynamical solution to the system , showing that the only stable solutions consistent with the data are those describing a 2:1 mmr .",
    "the planets have @xmath24 219 and 441 d and @xmath46 2.0 and 1.8 @xmath19 , respectively .      from an analysis of keck data",
    ", @xcite announced a @xmath24 422 d , @xmath47 planet around the chromospherically active k dwarf hd 128311 , for which high precision ( @xmath48 m / s ) can be difficult due to stellar `` jitter '' .",
    "@xcite used additional keck data to detect an outer companion of similar amplitude with @xmath49 d and @xmath50 , and used dynamical simulations to show that the system is almost certainly locked in a 2:1 mmr .",
    "@xcite suggested that since the system appears not to show apsidal corotation , it may owe its present state to a strong scattering event in its past .",
    "@xcite used data from ucles to report the detection of a @xmath51 d planet orbiting hd 73526 .",
    "another three years of data allowed @xcite to report a second planet in a 378 d orbit and show that these planets ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) are in 2:1 resonance .",
    "@xcite showed that the published solution was chaotic found alternative , non - chaotic ( regular ) orbital solutions for the system , and argued that , like hd 128311 , the system s dynamical state showed evidence of a perturbative event such as a strong scattering event .",
    "@xcite used keck data to report a @xmath54 d jovian planet orbiting hd 108874 , and noted that a good fit required a linear trend be used in the model , suggesting a more distant companion was present in the system . by mid-2005",
    ", these residuals had turned over , revealing a @xmath55 d outer companion .",
    "they noted that while these orbital periods are consistent with a 4:1 mmr , that resonance is narrow and non - resonant stable configurations consistent with the data exist .",
    "@xcite used coralie data to detect a large `` superplanet '' or brown dwarf with @xmath56 orbiting hd 202206 in a 255-d orbit , one of only a few detections in the `` brown dwarf desert '' .",
    "further coralie data allowed @xcite to announce a second , outer companion with @xmath57 y and @xmath58 .",
    "they report that while the system experiences strong planet - planet interactions , stability is protected by a 5:1 resonance .",
    "this system is especially interesting because it resembles a circumbinary planet . @xcite",
    "confirmed the 5:1 mmr and showed that the system is dynamically quite interesting , having different qualitative behavior depending on the inclinations of the companions .",
    "these eight systems contain two giant planets probably not in a _ true _ mean motion resonance , but for which other planet - planet interactions can be important in the dynamical modeling of the system .",
    "for instance , the planets orbiting hd 12661 are in apsidal libration .",
    "@xcite reported a planet orbiting the g6 dwarf hd 12661 based on observations at lick and keck observatories .",
    "subsequent observations allowed @xcite to report that the system is actually a double . today",
    "s best parameters ( @xcite ) show the @xmath29 and @xmath32 components having @xmath59 and 1822 d , and @xmath60 and 1.8 @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "@xcite found the system to be near the 6:1 mmr , and referred to its `` janus head '' of librating , anti - aligned apsidal lines .",
    "@xcite used het data to announce the lowest - metallicty planet host , the g subgiant hd 155385 .",
    "the system is a double , with no mmr but significant planet - planet interactions leading to eccentricity exchange with a period of @xmath62 y. the @xmath29 and @xmath32 components have @xmath63 and 530 d , and @xmath64 and 0.5 @xmath61 , respectively .",

    "further data allowed @xcite to identify a second , @xmath67 y , @xmath35 planet in the system .",
    "@xcite showed that there are large exchanges of eccentricity between the components in coplanar configurations and that the system is stable for a large range of inclinations .",
    "@xcite used keck data to report an @xmath68 planet in a 634 d , eccentric orbit around hd 183263 , and note a strong residual linear trend .",
    "@xcite showed that by 2007 the residuals had significant curvature , and @xcite showed that the orbit , though still incomplete , was sufficient , in combination with stability analysis , to constrain the mass and period of the outer companion to @xmath69 y and @xmath70 under the assumption that no additional companions are contributing to the radial velocities .",
    "the third star known to host exoplanets was 47 uma , announced by @xcite as hosting a @xmath71 y planet on a circular orbit as determined from data taken at lick observatory .",
    "this was the first planet strongly reminiscent of the gas giants in our solar system .",
    "@xcite studied another 5 years of lick data and reported a second planet in the system , having @xmath72 d and @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , using elodie and het data , respectively , have noted that a second planet with the reported parameters is not apparent in their data .",
    "future observations should clarify the situation .",
    "@xcite included hip 14810 @xmath29 in the _ catalog of nearby exoplanets _ based on preliminary data from keck observatory taken as part of the n2k survey ( @xcite ) , and further observations allowed @xcite to provide an orbital solution for two planets , having @xmath74 and 95 d and @xmath75 and 0.76 @xmath61 .",
    "because the outer planet s orbit is currently poorly sampled , further observations will help clarify the nature of this system and allow for it to be better studied dynamically .",
    "@xcite announced the remarkable detection of a double - planet system around the distant ( @xmath76kpc ) star ogle-2006-blg-109l during a microlensing event .",
    "due to the great distance to this system and the non - repeating nature of microlensing detections , the study of the dynamics of this system with specificity is difficult ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "this detection demonstrates the promise of microlensing as a method to build up statistics of multi - planet systems , including those composed of rocky planets at a few au .",
    "the most likely masses and orbital distances of these planets are @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 and 4.6 au , making this system around a k star a `` scaled - down juipter - saturn analog ''      @xcite used het to announce two companions orbiting the giant star hd 102272 .",
