    "this paper is concerned with a chiral version of the celebrated sine - gordon ( sg ) field theory in one dimension , in which the standard kinetic term is replaced by the kinetic term for a _ chiral _ bose field .",

    "indeed , a previous analysis of this problem by renn @xcite is in error precisely because of his neglect of the chiral constraint .",
    "we will comment further on the difference between the two theories at several points in the main text .",
    "the chief interest of the chiral sine - gordon ( @xmath7sg ) theory is that it arises naturally , as we detail below , in the edge theory of double - layer quantum hall systems when it is necessary to take account of weak interlayer - tunneling within wen s chiral bosonic description of the edge dynamics . as such it is the simplest of a family of interacting chiral theories in one dimension that describe the dynamics of multicomponent systems .",
    "( such systems yield non - chiral problems as well , in cases where there are counter - propagating modes , and they have attracted considerable attention . )",
    "these theories are much more constrained than generic non - chiral theories , but they are by no means trivial and they exhibit unusual connections between renormalization group flows and spectral rearrangements . in a sense",
    ", they are intermediate in complexity between quantum impurity problems , which can be mapped to chiral problems with interactions localized at a point , and generic one dimensional field theories , and seem worth studying on this account as well .",
    "dijkgraaf has explored some general properties of chiral theories from a conformal field theory viewpoint@xcite , and several authors have considered particular examples such as the chiral potts model @xcite and the chiral schwinger model . finally , the study of chiral field theories is not without interest in another condensed matter context : ho and coleman have recently motivated the study of interacting chiral majorana theories by appealing to the phenomenology of the cuprates and have presented solutions of several models by an interesting `` fermionic bootstrap '' .    we begin with a review of the bosonic formulation of the edge theory of double - layer quantum hall systems with interlayer tunneling ( section [ sec : edgetheory ] ) . for systems with one mode per layer we show that for clean , symmetric realizations , the edge theory separates into the sum of a free boson hamiltonian and the hamiltonian with @xmath8 ( the `` bosonic '' sequence ) .",
    "we argue that the theory is manifestly sensible only for integer values of @xmath9 .",
    "layer asymmetry and disorder , which lead to a more complicated dynamics , will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "next we consider the renormalization group flow of the theory , perturbatively in @xmath10 , and argue that it differs from the usual sg theory ( section [ sec : rg ] ) .",
    "we argue that @xmath0 is not renormalized and for @xmath1 there is a line of fixed points parameterized by @xmath10 . in section [ sec : exactsolns ]",
    "we obtain exact solutions for the spectrum and correlation functions of the theory for @xmath11 and @xmath1 which are the two members of the bosonic sequence at which the interaction is not irrelevant . at @xmath11",
    "we show by `` re - bosonization '' , that the spectrum of the interacting theory is , in the thermodynamic limit , still that of a free chiral boson .",
    "perhaps of greatest interest is our solution by fermionization at @xmath1 , relevant to the experimentally observed 331 state , where the theory is shown to be equivalent to a theory with two chiral majorana fermions with dynamically generated distinct velocities .",
    "next we present a method for fermionizing the theory at @xmath3 by the introduction of auxiliary bosons ( section [ sec : fermionizations ] ) .",
    "we show that for @xmath11 and @xmath1 the fermionized theory with auxiliary degrees of freedom can be solved exactly , and after projection onto the hilbert space we recover the results of section [ sec : exactsolns ] . in section [ sec : fermiseq ]",
    "we briefly consider the theory at the points @xmath12 ( the `` fermionic '' sequence ) , which do not correspond to any double - layer system .",
    "we comment briefly on the difficulties in understanding our results from the kinds of semiclassical considerations that are so useful in the standard sine - gordon problem in section [ sec : semiclass ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion ( section [ sec : disc ] ) and several appendices giving detailed calculations in support of statements made in the text .",
    "we are interested in a system consisting of two parallel layers of 2degs ( two - dimensional electron gases ) in a strong perpendicular magnetic field , with a confining potential that restricts the electrons in each layer to a region with the topology of a disc .",
