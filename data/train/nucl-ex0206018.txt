    "the heaviest elements are a laboratory to study nuclear structure and nuclear dynamics under the influence of large coulomb forces .",
    "the results of heavy element research deal with fundamental issues in both chemistry and physics . during the past six years",
    ", there have been spectacular advances in this field , _ i.e. _ , the discovery of elements 110 - 112 , the synthesis of elements 114 @xcite and element 116 @xcite by `` hot fusion '' reactions , the first chemical studies of elements 104 - 108 and the spectroscopy of the transfermium nuclei .    as an aside , we note the two different traditional paths to the heavy elements : ( a ) `` cold fusion '' , involving the reaction of massive projectiles with pb and bi target nuclei , leading to low excitation energies in the completely fused species ( with resulting high survival probabilities ) and reduced fusion cross sections and ( b ) `` hot fusion '' , the reaction of lighter projectiles with actinide target nuclei , leading to larger fusion cross sections but reduced survival probabilities ( due to the higher excitation energies of the completely fused species . ) at present , it appears that hot fusion reactions are the preferred path to synthesize new heavy elements ( figure [ fig1 ] ) although the large cross sections associated with the production of elements 112 - 116 are poorly understood @xcite . in any case , it is imperative to confirm these reported hot fusion cross sections in laboratories not connected to the original work .    ]    in 1999 , a dubna - gsi - riken collaboration @xcite reported the successful synthesis of @xmath2112 using the reaction 231 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath1u @xmath3112 @xmath4112 + 3n with the observation of two events .",
    "the nuclide @xmath2112 ( t@xmath5 = 81@xmath6 s ) was reported to decay by spontaneous fission ( sf ) and was produced with a cross section of 5.0@xmath7 pb . the decay mode of @xmath2112 is somewhat unexpected as all the other isotopes of element 112 ( a=277,284 and 285 ) decay by alpha emission .",
    "the dubna - gsi - riken collaboration searched for alpha decay in @xmath2112 but did not see any events .",
    "subsequently , in the reaction of @xmath0ca with @xmath8pu , two events were found in which an evaporation residue ( evr ) emitted an alpha - particle , producing a daughter nucleus that decayed by sf .",
    "these latter sf decays were attributed to the decay of @xmath2112 and if taken with the previous work , imply a half - life of@xmath93 m for @xmath2112 .    in figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "we show the predicted @xcite and observed q@xmath10 values for the well - characterized alpha - decay of @xmath11112 and its daughters ( @xmath12110,@xmath13hs , @xmath14sg , @xmath15rf and @xmath16no ) .",
    "the semi - empirical predictions of liran _",
    "et al._@xcite apparently do not include the nuclear structure effects near the n=162 subshell .",
    "the theoretical predictions of smolaczuk @xcite seem to do the best job of predicting the observed values of q@xmath10 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we show a similar plot of the predicted and observed values of q@xmath10 for the @xmath21-decay of various isotopes of element 112 .",
    "values for the decay of @xmath11112.[fig2 ] ]     values for the decay of various isotopes of element 112.[fig3 ] ]    the predictions of liran et al . deviate significantly from the observed values with the predictions of royer and mller et al .",
    "being similar .",
    "the theoretical predictions of mller _ et al . _ and smolaczuk are approximately equal in their ability to predict q@xmath10 with a slight preference being given to the predictions of mller _ et al . _",
    "( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) using these comparisons of predicted and observed values of q@xmath10 as a guide , we favor the predictions of smolaczuk as being the most reliable guide to the expected decay properties of element 112 . however some caution must be exercised as none of the predictions provide a statistically significant fit to the data . in the only calculation @xcite to address the spontaneous fission and alpha decay of the isotopes of 112 , alpha decay is predicted to be the dominant mode of decay for all isotopes although the differences in predicted half - lives are only an order of magnitude for the nuclei of interest .",
    "we show in figure [ fig4 ] , the expected alpha decay sequence for @xmath2112 based upon the predictions of smolaczuk for the masses of the heaviest elements and the hatsukawa - nakahara - hoffman rules for the alpha decay lifetimes of the heavy nuclei . @xcite .",
    "as indicated earlier , in searching for these predicted alpha decay sequences , one must be sensitive over a wide range of nuclear lifetimes .",
    "112.[fig4 ] ]    the nucleus @xmath2112 and its synthesis play an important role in our understanding of the recent syntheses of elements 114 and 116 by hot fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "@xmath2112 is directly populated in the de - excitation of @xmath26114 synthesized using the @xmath0ca + @xmath8pu reaction@xcite .",
    "the long half - life is typical of elements 112 and 114 nuclei produced in the synthesis of elements 114 and 116 @xcite .",
    "the relatively large reported production cross section , 5 pb , is typical of the higher cross sections associated with hot fusion reactions compared to cold fusion reactions ( figure [ fig1 ] ) for the synthesis of z @xmath27 112 .",
    "it is these same cross sections , which challenge our understanding because current theoretical predictions of the survival probabilities in these reactions @xcite would not give cross sections of this magnitude .",
    "for example , armbruster @xcite using the best available data on the capture cross sections , the probability of evolving from the contact configuration to the completely fused system and the survival probabilities , estimated a evaporation residue production section for the reaction of 231 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath1u @xmath28112 @xmath4112 + 3n of 50 fb .",
    "the reaction @xmath1u(@xmath0ca,3n)was studied at the 88-inch cyclotron of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , using the berkeley gas - filled separator @xcite .",
    "the experimental apparatus was a modified , improved version of the apparatus used in @xcite , including improved detectors and data acquisition system , continuous monitoring of the separator gas purity , and better monitoring of the @xmath0ca beam intensity and energy .",
    "a @xmath0ca@xmath29beam was accelerated to 243.5 mev with an average current of @xmath93 x 10@xmath30ions / s ( 480 particle - na ) .",
    "the beam went through the 45 @xmath31g/@xmath32carbon entrance window of the separator before passing through the @xmath1u target placed 0.5 cm downstream from the window .",
    "the targets were uf@xmath33 deposits ( u thickness = 463 @xmath31g/@xmath32 ) with an 0.54 mg/@xmath32al backing on the upstream side .",
    "nine of the arc - shaped targets were mounted on a 35-cm wheel that was rotated at 300 rpm .",
    "the beam energy in the target was 228 - 234 mev @xcite , encompassing the projectile energy range used in @xcite .",
    "the beam intensity was monitored by two silicon p - i - n detectors ( mounted at @xmath3427 degrees with respect to the incident beam ) that detected elastically scattered beam particles from the target .",
    "attenuating screens were installed in front of these detectors to reduce the number of particles reaching them ( and any subsequent radiation damage to the detector ) .",
    "the run lasted approximately 5.5 days .",
    "the evrs ( e@xmath939 mev ) were separated spatially in flight from beam particles and transfer reaction products by their differing magnetic rigidities in the gas - filled separator .",
    "the separator was filled with helium gas at a pressure of 96 pa .",
    "the expected magnetic rigidities of 39-mev @xmath2112 evrs were estimated using the data of ghiorso et al.@xcite these estimates were 2.25 tm from extrapolation of the data in their figure [ fig4 ] and 2.63 tm for their semi - empirical equation ( equation 4 ) for evr charge .",
    "after comparison of the optimum b@xmath35 values determined experimentally with the bgs for the evrs from the reaction of 202 mev @xmath0ca with @xmath36yb , 215 mev @xmath0ca with @xmath37pb and 309 mev @xmath38ni with @xmath37pb which all corresponded to the  graphical value \" of b@xmath35 , we chose a b@xmath35 of 2.25 tm for the separator magnetic field .",
    "to determine the transport efficiency of the bgs , we used a combination of measurements and monte carlo simulations .",
    "we measured the transport efficiency of the separator , the efficiency of transporting an evr produced in the target and implanting it in the focal plane detector , to be 57% for the reaction of 202 mev @xmath0ca with @xmath36yb , assuming a cross section for this reaction of @xmath9790 @xmath31b .",
    "( this latter value was extrapolated from the measured data of sahm , et al.@xcite )  a monte carlo simulation of the separator efficiency for this reaction @xcite predicted an efficiency of 53% .",
    "we measured a transport efficiency of 45% for the reaction of 215 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath37pb @xmath39no + 2n .",
    "( this efficiency is based on a cross section for the @xmath37pb(@xmath0ca , 2n ) reaction of 3.0 @xmath31b .",
    "@xcite )  the monte carlo simulation program predicted 51% .",
    "having thus  validated \" the monte carlo simulation code , we used it to estimate a transport efficiency for the @xmath2112 evrs of 49% for the reaction of 231 mev @xmath0ca with @xmath1u under the conditions described above .",
    "this value is similar to efficiencies reported for similar reactions using the dubna gas - filled separator .",
    "@xcite    as a further demonstration of our ability to measure events similar to those being sought in the @xmath0ca + @xmath1u experiment , we measured the cross section for the 215.5 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath40pb @xmath41no + 2n reaction by detecting the sf decay ( sf branching ratio 0.269 ) of @xmath42no .",
    "we measured a cross section of 585 @xmath3490 @xmath31b for this reaction in agreement with the known value of 500 @xmath31b .",
    "@xcite    in the focal plane region of the separator , the evrs passed through a 10 cm x 10 cm parallel plate avalanche counter ( ppac ) @xcite that registered the time , @xmath43e , and x , y position of the particles .",
    "this ppac has an approximate thickness equivalent to 0.6 mg/@xmath32 of carbon .",
    "the ppac was @xmath929 cm from the focal plane detector .",
    "the time - of - flight of the evrs between the ppac and the focal plane detector was measured .",
    "the ppac was used to distinguish between beam - related particles hitting the focal plane detector and events due to the decay of previously implanted atoms . during these experiments ,",
    "the ppac efficiency for detecting beam - related particles depositing between 8 and 14 mev in the focal plane detector was 97.5 - 99.5% .",
    "after passing through the ppac , the recoils were implanted in a 32 strip , 300 @xmath31 m thick passivated ion implanted silicon detector at the focal plane that had an active area of 116 mm x 58 mm .",
    "the strips were position sensitive in the vertical ( 58 mm ) direction .",
    "the energy resolution of the focal plane detector was measured to be @xmath970 kev ( fwhm ) .",
    "the differences in measured positions for the @xmath42no - @xmath44fm full energy @xmath45 correlations in a study of the 215.5 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath40pb reaction had a gaussian distribution with a fwhm of 0.52 mm ( @xmath46 mm ) .",
    "the measured position resolution for full energy alpha particles correlated to `` escape '' alpha particles ( which deposited only 0.5 - 3.0 mev in the detector ) was @xmath91.2 mm ( fwhm ) .",
    "a second silicon strip `` punch - through '' detector was installed behind this detector to reject particles passing through the primary detector .",
    "a `` top '' and a `` bottom '' detector were installed in front of the focal plane detector to detect escaping alpha particles and fission fragments . the focal plane detector combined with these `` top '' and `` bottom '' detectors had an estimated efficiency of 75% for the detection of full energy 10 mev @xmath21-particles following implantation of a @xmath2112 nucleus .",
    "any event with e @xmath27 0.5 mev in the focal plane si - strip detector triggered the data acquisition .",
    "data were recorded in list mode , and included the time of the trigger , the position and energy signals from the ppac and the si - strip detectors , and energy signals from the  top \" ,  bottom \" and  punch - through \" detectors . with the use of buffering adcs and scalers ,",
    "the minimum time between successive events was 15 @xmath31s .    in a study of the 215 mev @xmath0ca + @xmath40pb reaction ,",
    "the pulse height defect for the @xmath917 mev @xmath42no recoils was determined to be @xmath910 mev .",
    "this correction was used to determine the expected range of energies associated with the @xmath915 mev @xmath2112 recoils as they struck the focal plane detector .    with a beam current of 3 x 10@xmath30 @xmath0ca ions striking the target ,",
    "the average total counting rates ( e @xmath27 0.5 mev ) in the focal plane detector were @xmath90.84/s .",
    "the average rate of  alpha particles \" ( 7 - 14 mev with no ppac signal ) was @xmath47 0.028/s .",
    "two search strategies were used to look for events corresponding to the implantation and decay of @xmath2112 nuclei .",
    "the first strategy assumed the decay of @xmath2112 would occur as outlined in figure [ fig4 ] , in accord with the predictions of smolaczuk .",
    "we searched for evr-@xmath21 , @xmath21-@xmath21 , and evr - fission events occurring within 6 s , restricting the range of @xmath21-particle energies to be from 8 to 11 mev and the single fragment fission energies to be @xmath48 90 mev .",
    "no events were observed with a total dose of 1.1x10@xmath49 ions .",
    "this corresponds to a one - event upper limit cross section of 1.8 pb for @xmath2112 nuclei decaying by alpha - particle emission and 1.6 pb for spontaneously fissioning @xmath2112 nuclei when one takes into account the differing efficiencies of detecting fission fragments and alpha - particle decay chains .    a second strategy involved searching for events similar to those reported by the dubna - gsi - riken group .",
    "we searched for evr-@xmath21 , @xmath21-@xmath21 , and evr - fission events occuring within 1000 s , using the same energy restrictions as in the first search .",
    "no evr - fission events were found , leading to a one event upper limit cross section of 1.6 pb for the type of event reported by the dubna - gsi - riken group or any chain terminating in an sf decay . due to a significant number of accidental evr-@xmath21 and @xmath21-@xmath21 events , no meaningful upper limit could be set for evr-@xmath21 events with these longer correlation times .",
    "the one event upper limit cross section for the production of spontaneously fissioning @xmath2112 nuclei of 1.6 pb is just below that reported by the dubna - gsi - riken group of 5.0@xmath7 pb .",
    "another relevant observation is that of yakushev , _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite who reported the failure to observe any spontaneously fissioning @xmath2112 nuclei in the reaction of 234 mev @xmath0ca with @xmath1u using the assumption that element 112 behaves like hg , a volatile liquid , in its chemistry .",
    "if element 112 behaves chemically like hg , then this observation would suggest an upper limit cross section of @xmath91.5 pb for this reaction .",
    "an alternative explanation @xcite is that element 112 behaves chemically like a noble gas ( rn ) .",
    "recent theoretical predictions @xcite using the dinuclear system approach , have suggested a cross section for the @xmath1u(@xmath0ca,3n)@xmath2112 reaction of 1.7 pb .",
    "further work is needed to establish the cross section for the production of @xmath2112 in the @xmath1u(@xmath0ca,3n ) reaction .",
    "because the reported spontaneous fission decay is not definitive to determine the z and a of this nucleus , it seems especially important to detect the @xmath21-decay branch for this nuclide . the apparently small cross sections and/or weaker @xmath21-decay branching ratios make this worthwhile effort difficult . if , as indicated in this work , the production cross section for @xmath2112 in the @xmath1u(@xmath0ca,3n ) reaction is @xmath92 pb or less , then it becomes more difficult to understand the reported cross sections of @xmath91 pb for the production of elements 114 and 116 in similar reactions .",
