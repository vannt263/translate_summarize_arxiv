    "meson - nuclear systems are very important and useful objects to extract the meson properties at finite density , which may have close connections to the chiral symmetry breaking and its partial restoration in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the effective nuclear densities probed by pionic atoms are known to be around @xmath0 for almost every pionic state  @xcite and the change of the chiral order parameter @xmath1 in nuclei is only determined at this specific density  @xcite .",
    "thus , we are very interested in the density probed by various meson - nucleus systems to find out the proper mesonic systems to explore the meson properties at various nuclear densities , which will be important to investigate the aspects of qcd symmetries at various nuclear densities beyond the linear density approximation  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the effective density of bound states for anti - kaon ( kaonic atoms ) , and scattering states of anti - kaon and kaon with nucleus . as for the kaonic atoms , we already do the similar analysis as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we define the overlapping probability ( @xmath2 ) of the kaonic atom density ( @xmath3 ) with the nucleon density distribution ( @xmath4 ) to obtain the effective density , as @xmath5 since the integration of the @xmath2 function gives the shift of anti - kaon binding energy as @xmath6 in the first order perturbation theory for the change of the potential term depending on the density linearly , we define the nucleon density at the peak position of @xmath2 as the effective nuclear density for bound states , which is expected to be most sensitive part of @xmath7 to the meson binding energy .    for scattering states ,",
    "we newly determine the different overlapping probability ( @xmath8 ) as , @xmath9 in this case , we define the @xmath8 function so as to have the peak at the density which is most sensitive to a differential cross section , namely the change of the differential cross section is related to the @xmath8 as , @xmath10 instead of the binding energy for the bound states . here",
    ", we consider the scattering with @xmath11c at @xmath12 .    the meson wavefunction @xmath13 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are obatined by solving the klein - gordon equation with meson - nucleus optical potential . in this article , we use two kinds of the optical potentials for anti - kaon , which are the chiral unitary potential  @xcite and the phenomenological potential  @xcite . for @xmath14 scattering",
    ", we use the potential given in ref .",
    "the all potentials used in this article are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "c obtained by ( a ) chiral unitary approach  @xcite and ( b ) phenomenological fit @xcite are shown as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath15 . the kaon-@xmath11c potential ( c ) obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is also shown .",
    "the upper and lower panels show the real and imaginary part of the potential , respectively .",
    "the kaon - nucleus potential in ref .",
    "@xcite does nt have imaginary part .",
    "some of the potential have the energy dependence as shown in the figures . ]",
    "as for the kaonic atoms , we show the calculated anti - kaon densities ( @xmath3 ) and the nucelon density distributions ( @xmath4 ) , and the overlapping probabilities ( @xmath2 ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] @xcite",
    ". the nuclear density at the peak position of @xmath2 shown in the lower panels corresponds to the effective nuclear density .",
    "we can see that the effective densities probed by atomic kaons depend on the atomic orbits significantly . comparing the results of two potentials , we find the differences of the structure of the overlapping probabilities @xmath2 .",
    "these differences are related to the properties of the deeply bound kaonic nuclear state for both potential cases , since the kaonic nuclear states exist for both potentials . in the phenomenological potential ,",
    "the kaonic nuclear states are deeper than those in the chiral unitary potential .",
    "the wave functions of the atomic and nuclear states should be orthogonal .",
    "owing to the orthogonality the wave functions of atomic states have nodes in the region of the nuclear size  @xcite .",
    "the effective densities obtained from the overlapping probabilities will have information on the difference of the potentials , which might be extracted from experimental data .",
    "c calculated with the ( left ) chiral unitary and ( right ) phenomenological optical potentials . ]    for scattering states , we show the calculated results of the energy dependence of the effective density in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( anti - kaon ) and [ fig4 ] ( kaon ) . from these results ,",
    "we find the effective density for anti - kaon dicreases for higher anti - kaon energy .",
    "it would be natural that the effective density for higher energy could become smaller than that for lower energy since the important partial waves become larger for higher energy in general , and the wave function with larger angular momentum will observe more outer part of the nucleus due to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this is the case for the anti - kaon scattering . for the anti - kaon , the increase of the effective density for each partial wave is moderate , because the anti - kaon exists inside the nucleus with small probability due to the large absorption .",
    "in contrast , the effective density for kaon increases for higher kaon energy . this is because the potential of kaon in ref .",
    "@xcite is weak repulsive and does not have imaginary part .",
    "it means that the kaon with higher energy can penetrate into the nucleus without any absorption .",
    "this makes the effective density of each partial wave increase rapidly .",
    "this is the reason that the kaon system has different effective densities from those of the anti - kaon system .",
    "c with chiral unitary approach ( left ) and phenomenological fit ( right ) as plotted as the functions of the anti - kaon kinetic energy [ mev ] .",
    "the contributions from a first few partial waves in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are also shown in the figure . ]     except for the kaon scattering case . ]",
    "we have calculated the effective nuclear density probed by anti - kaon and kaon . the effective nuclear density is defined from the overlapping probability of the meson density and the nucleon density distribution . as for the bound states , we consider the kaonic atoms .",
    "we find the effective density probed by anti - kaon in atomic orbit depends on the quantum numbers of the atomic states .",
    "for the scattering states , we have investigated the energy dependence of the effective density . from this study",
    ", we find the effective density of anti - kaon decreases for higher anti - kaon energy due to the centrifugal barrier and the strong absorption inside the nucleus .",
    "we also find the kaon for higher energy could probe higher nuclear density , which is the opposite tendency to the anti - kaon system .",
