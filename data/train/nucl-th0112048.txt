    "in the past few years much effort has been devoted to the study of the @xmath4 scattering amplitude in nuclei and its possible experimental signals , like the enhancement of the @xmath4 invariant mass distributions close to the two pion threshold , seen in the experiments of pion induced two pion production in nuclei @xcite and the large strength shift found in the @xmath5 channel @xcite .",
    "the idea of strong threshold effects due to the @xmath6 interaction in a dense nuclear medium was first suggested in ref .",
    "these effects would show up in the scalar isoscalar channel and could be interpreted as a drop of the sigma mass in nuclear matter .",
    "later works , paying attention to the chiral constraints of the @xmath4 amplitude and trying to use realistic potentials , found indeed an appreciable enhancement of the @xmath7 scattering amplitude close to threshold @xcite .    these theoretical @xmath4 scattering amplitudes in the nuclear medium have been used in the analysis of the @xmath8 reactions in nuclei @xcite .",
    "although the modifications of the @xmath6 invariant mass distributions produced by the @xmath4 scattering go in the right direction , the calculations have not been successful in reproducing the full strength of the medium effects found in the experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss first our approach to the study of the pion pion interaction in nuclear matter .",
    "then , we will show some results on the @xmath1 meson mass and width .",
    "finally , we will discuss the possibility of finding a clear experimental signature of these effects in the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 reactions .",
    "in this section we briefly sketch the simple approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is enough for our purposes .",
    "more elaborate studies can be found in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to solve a bethe salpeter ( bs ) equation , which guarantees unitarity , matching the low energy results to the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10 ) predictions .",
    "we consider two possible intermediate states , @xmath6 and @xmath11 , labelled 1 and 2 in the formulas .",
    "the isospin 0 channel is given by the following combinations    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the mesons momentum in the center of mass ( cm ) system .",
    "we neglect the @xmath14 channel which is not relevant at the low energies we are interested in .",
    "the bs equation is given by @xmath15 eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] is an integral equation and the term @xmath16 involves the two mesons one loop divergent integral , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bsf ] ) where @xmath17 and @xmath18 appear off shell .",
    "however , for this channel both functions can be factorized on shell out of the integral .",
    "the remaining off shell part can be absorbed by a renormalization of the coupling constants as it was shown in refs.@xcite .",
    "thus , the bs equation becomes purely algebraic and the @xmath16 originally inside the loop integral becomes then the product of @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the on shell amplitudes , and @xmath19 given by the expression @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total momentum of the meson - meson system .",
    "this integral is regularized with a cut - off adjusted to optimize the fit to the @xmath22 phase shifts ( @xmath23 gev ) .",
    "finally the potential @xmath17 appearing in the bs equation is taken from the lowest order chiral lagrangians    @xmath24    where the symbol @xmath25 indicates the trace in flavour space , @xmath26 is the pion decay constant and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the meson and mass @xmath29 matrices .    in s - wave and for isospin zero",
    "the only pieces needed in our calculation are given by @xmath30 v_{21 } = - < \\pi \\pi | { \\cal l}_2 | k \\bar{k } > = - \\frac{1}{3 \\sqrt{12 } f^2 } ( \\frac{9}{2}s + 3 m_k^2 + 3m_\\pi^2 - \\frac{3}{2 }   \\sum_i p_i^2)\\\\[2ex ] v_{22 }",
    "= - < \\pi \\pi | { \\cal l}_2 | \\pi \\pi   > = - \\frac{1}{9   f^2 } ( 9 s + \\frac{15   m_\\pi^2}{2 }   - 3 \\sum_i p_i^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this model reproduces well phase shifts and inelasticities up to about 1.2 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath31 resonances appear as poles of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the coupling of channels is essential to produce the @xmath31 resonance , while the @xmath1 pole is little affected by the coupling of the pions to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "as we are mainly interested in the low energy region , which is not very sensitive to the kaon channels , we will only consider the nuclear medium effects on the pions .",
    "the main changes of the pion propagation in the nuclear medium come from the p - wave selfenergy , produced basically by the the coupling of pions to particle - hole ( @xmath32 ) and delta - hole ( @xmath33 ) excitations @xcite .",
    "thus , the new bs equation now will include the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : bsf2 ] where the solid line bubbles represent the @xmath32 and @xmath33 excitations .",
    "in fact , as it was shown in @xcite , the contact terms with the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) excitations of diagrams ( b)(c)(d ) cancel the off shell contribution from the meson meson vertices in the term of fig .",
    "[ fig : bsf2](a ) .",
    "hence , we just need to calculate the diagrams of the free type ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bsf ] ) and those of fig .",
    "[ fig : bsf2](a ) .",
    "there are other medium corrections , like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ]    which has been considered in several papers like @xcite using the linear sigma model .",
    "the coupling of the sigma to the nucleons , can be borrowed from the bonn potential @xcite .    in our approach",
    ", we start with only pseudoscalar meson fields .",
    "the sigma is generated dynamically through the rescattering of the pions .",
    "a possible analog to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] is given by the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpt ] .    in order to evaluate the contribution of these diagrams we use the chiral lagrangians involving the octet of baryons and the octet of pseudoscalar mesons and these terms",
    "result to be proportional to @xmath34 and thus vanish in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "also we would need to consider diagrams of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpt2 ]    we also get a negligible contribution to the the @xmath6 scattering in the nuclear medium from this diagram @xcite .",
    "finally , we could also include excitation of resonances from the occupied nucleon states by the pair of mesons .",
    "the major contribution comes from the @xmath35 roper resonance which couples to two pions in the scalar isoscalar channel and plays an important role in the @xmath36 reaction @xcite and other two pion production processes like the @xmath37 reaction close to threshold @xcite . the lowest order roper contribution diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rop1 ] .    details on the inclusion of this mechanism , the determination of the coupling constants and its effects , which are also small , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r4 ] we show our results for the @xmath4 scattering amplitude as a function of the nuclear density in a range of energies from 150 mev to 1100 mev .",
    "as one can see in the figure , there is an accumulation of strength in the imaginary part of the amplitude close to the two pion threshold as it was predicted by @xcite and had been also found in other calculations @xcite .",
    "the possible relation of this strength to the enhanced two pion invariant mass distribution in @xmath2 reactions in nuclei at small invariant masses will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the strength below the two pion threshold corresponds to the decay into particle - hole states . at intermediate invariant masses",
    "we can see a quite strong decrease of the strength of the imaginary part , and also large distortions of the real part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "this could lead to some effects , not yet investigated , for two pion production reactions .",
    "below 900 mev , the effect of the two kaon channel are quite small , and a single channel calculation would lead to quite similar results .    also the @xmath38 resonance properties are modified in the medium .",
    "the position of the resonance does not change much as a function of the density .",
    "however , the width increases gradually until the resonant shape practically disappears above the normal nuclear density .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r6 ] we show the @xmath39 amplitude . in this channel",
    "the @xmath38 appears as a breit wigner contribution rotated 90 degrees and it is more easily visible , due to the absence of a large background of the @xmath6 elastic scattering .",
    "the resonant - like behavior found around 300 mev is mainly produced by the strong coupling of the two kaon channel to the roper - hole excitation .",
    "a detailed discussion on that coupling and results for the @xmath40 amplitude can be found in ref .",
    "in this section we will consider the ligthest pole position of the @xmath4 scattering amplitude in the s = i=0 channel in the complex energy plane , which corresponds to the @xmath1 resonance . in vacuum ,",
    "the pole position occurs at a mass around 470 mev and the width is around 400 mev @xcite .",
    "a compilation of values for these magnitudes obtained in several modern analyses can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . see also fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analytical structure of the meson meson scattering amplitude is driven by the meson loops depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r7 ] ,    which are given by the formula @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 propagator which , in the nuclei , will incorporate the p - wave coupling of the pions to particle - hole and @xmath44-hole excitations .",
    "we can simplify the calculation by using the lehmann representation for the meson propagators @xmath45 after some algebraic manipulation we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a real function given by @xmath48 which in vacuum takes the simple form @xmath49 where @xmath50 the function @xmath47 includes all the phenomenological information on the pion selfenergy in the nuclear medium .",
    "the results for several densities are shown in fig.[fig : r8 ]    the @xmath47 strength is related to the imaginary part of the @xmath1 propagator and therefore reflects the energy and density dependence of the different @xmath1 decay channels .",
    "we can start classifying them according to their density dependence ( see .",
    "fig.[fig : r9 ] ) .    at low densities ,",
    "the @xmath1 meson can only decay into two pions , @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we have a threshold at @xmath52 .",
    "as the density grows the @xmath53 decay channel becomes relevant and we have a new threshold at @xmath54 , which is clearly visible in the curve corresponding to @xmath55 . finally , at larger densities , mechanisms such as @xmath56 which go like @xmath57 become important .",
    "they are possible even at very low energies .    using the two meson propagator of eq .",
    "[ eq : poles ] we can calculate the scattering amplitude and look for the poles in the complex energy plane . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r10 ] for densities up to 1.5 @xmath58 .",
    "note , however , that the calculation is more reliable at low densities because some contributions of order @xmath57 or higher are missing .",
    "we find that both mass and width decrease as the density increases , reaching a mass around 200 mev and a similar width at 1.5 times the nuclear density .",
    "similar results are found in other models .",
    "see for instance fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "but we should stress that there the changes respond to a reduction of the @xmath59 value which we have kept constant . the basic ingredient that drives the mass decrease in our calculation is the p - wave interaction of the pion with the baryons in the medium .",
    "the change of @xmath59 as a fuction of density in @xcite and related works is linked to the renormalization of the axial current in nuclei , but in standard many body theory these currents are renormalized using the same lagrangians that in the evaluation of the pion selfenergy @xcite .",
    "therefore one should not modify @xmath59 in these latter approaches to avoid doublecounting .",
    "in fact a large change at normal nuclear density would be quite difficult to accommodate to the quite well known pion nucleus phenomenology ( pionic atoms , pion absorption , etc . ) .",
    "reactions with two low energy pions in the final state are the obvious candidates to test the @xmath1 meson properties in the nuclear medium . both chaos and",
    "cb data on the @xmath60 reaction have been extensively discussed in several talks at this conference .",
    "therefore , we will just comment briefly a few points .    in both cases",
    "there are clear and strong medium effects in the scalar isoscalar channels .",
    "the chaos collaboration has measured several charge channels that show these effects to be absent in other channels .",
    "so far , the theoretical attempts have failed to reproduce existing data .",
    "the enhancement obtained at low `` @xmath1 '' masses by the calculations is too small .",
    "there are claims that additional strength would be gained once the effects of the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry are included to the `` standard '' nuclear medium effects of the current theoretical analyses .",
    "however , even large changes in the pion pion interaction would affect little the calculations .",
    "the main reason for this being the very large distortion ( quasielastic and absorption ) of the initial pions at the chaos energies .",
    "because of this , the reaction happens at the nuclear surface , with a quite low effective density",
    ".    on the other hand , the @xmath61 and @xmath62 channels are very small at low invariant masses of the two pions system . comparing these invariant mass distributions with phase space , and studying the microscopic model for the reaction it is clear that there are strong cancellations between different mechanisms that contribute to this reaction .",
    "these cancellations could be modified in nuclei if the relative phases of the involved mechanisms change even slightly and that could produce a large part of the observed effects .    further and better studies are clearly needed .",
    "however , @xmath8 reactions will never be free from the two problems pointed out , the strong initial pion distortion ( and therefore small effective density ) and the complicated microscopical mechanisms involved .",
    "the @xmath9 process is , at least , free from the first of those problems and look clearly more promising@xcite .",
    "some preliminary results have already been presented at this conference by volker metag and could be more conclusive in determining the strength of the @xmath22 interaction in nuclei .",
