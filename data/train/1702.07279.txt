    "the topic of dynamical systems of few - bodies has always been one of the most fascinating fields in celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy .",

    "november 3 , 2016 ) , the few - problem problem strongly attracts the scientific interest .",
    "there is no doubt that one of the most well investigated versions of the few - body problem is the circular or elliptic restricted ( or not ) three - body problem @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "the planar restricted four - body problem describes the motion of a test particle with infinitesimal mass ( with respect to the masses of the primaries ) moving inside the gravitational field of three primary bodies .",
    "there are two main configurations regarding the position of the three primary bodies : ( i ) the eulerian configuration , where all three primaries lie on the same axis and ( ii ) the lagrangian or triangular configuration , where the three primaries always lie at the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "for the latter configuration we have the case of the planar equilateral restricted four - body problem ( perfbp ) .",
    "usually , for the corresponding configurations we use the term  central configurations \" due to the fact that the accelerations of the three primary bodies are proportional to the corresponding radius - vectors , while they are directed toward the common center of gravity @xcite .    over the years , the four - body problem has been used , by many researchers , for several practical applications , such as describing real celestial systems .",
    "for example : @xcite for the epsilon aurigae system , @xcite for the sun - jupiter - saturn system , @xcite for a system of a star , two massive planets and a massless trojan , @xcite and references therein for a system of a star , a brown dwarf , a gas giant and a massless trojan , @xcite and references therein and @xcite for the sun - jupiter - trojan asteroid , spacecraft system , @xcite for the sun - earth - moon system , where the fourth body can be a space vehicle",

    "we perform a scan of the configuration @xmath1 plane in order to determine from which of the equilibrium points ( attractors ) each initial condition is attracted by .",
    "the attracting domains in several types of dynamical systems have been numerically investigated .",
    "the newton - raphson iterative method was used in @xcite to explore the basins of attraction in the hill s problem with oblateness and radiation pressure , while in @xcite the multivariate version of the same iterative scheme has been used to unveil the basins of convergence in the restricted three - body problem with oblateness and radiation pressure .",

    "[ pr1 ] we present a large collection of color - coded plots illustrating the newton - raphson basins of convergence for several values of the mass parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that the existence of one very large primary body and two small ones substantially influences the structure of the attracting basins , with respect to what we seen earlier in fig .",
    "[ sm]a where all primaries had equal masses .",
    "it is seen that well - formed basins of convergence cover the majority of the configuration @xmath1 plane . however , the boundaries of all these basins exhibit a highly fractal structure and we may say that they behave as a  chaotic sea \" .",
    "the meaning of chaos is justified taking into account that if we choose a starting point @xmath78 inside these fractal areas we will observe that the choice is highly sensitive .",
    "in particular , even a slight change in the initial conditions leads to a completely different final destination ( different attractor ) .",
    "this implies that in these areas it is almost impossible to predict from which of the libration points each initial condition is attracted by .",
    "as the value of the mass parameter @xmath0 increases the structure of the configuration @xmath1 plane changes drastically .",
    "we found that the evolution of the structure of the @xmath1 plane , with respect to the mass parameter @xmath0 , does not follow a specific pattern . on the contrary ,",

    "[ pr1](a - i ) one may easily observe a very interesting phenomenon related with the extent of the basins of convergence . indeed , the extent of the basins of convergence corresponding to non - collinear points is always finite , while on the other hand the extent of the attracting domains of the two collinear points , @xmath95 and @xmath56 , extends to infinity . in most of the examined cases",
    "it is the @xmath95 basins which is infinite .",
    "additional numerical calculations indicate that for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 the attracting domain with infinite area corresponds to libration point @xmath95 , while for @xmath99 and @xmath100 the basins of convergence corresponding to collinear point @xmath56 are infinite .",
    "for all the other values of @xmath0 , always in the range @xmath101 , it is nearly impossible to know beforehand which of the two collinear equilibrium points dominates with infinite basins of attraction .    in panel ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ pr1 ] , where @xmath102 ( or in other words , equal to the first critical value of @xmath0 ) , the basins of convergence are surrounded by a highly chaotic mixture .",
    "this mixture is composed of initial conditions of three types : ( i ) initial conditions attracted by @xmath95 ; ( ii ) initial conditions attracted by @xmath56 ; ( iii ) initial conditions for which the multivariate newton - raphson method does not converge to any of the attractors .",
    "these non - converging initial conditions are in reality extremely slow converging points for which the multivariate newton - raphson method requires more than 500 iterations .",
    "indeed , if we increase the maximum allowed number of iteration from 500 to 5000 we will see that all non - converging points finally converge , sooner or later , to either @xmath95 or @xmath56 .    the distribution of the corresponding number @xmath91 of iterations required for obtaining the desired accuracy is provided in fig .",
    "[ pr1n](a - i ) , using tones of blue . it is more than evident that initial conditions inside the basins of attraction converge relatively fast @xmath103 , while the slowest converging points @xmath104 are those in the vicinity of the basin boundaries . in the same vein , in fig .",
    "[ pr1p](a - i ) the corresponding probability distribution of iterations is presented .",
    "the definition of the probability @xmath105 is the following : if we assume that @xmath106 initial conditions @xmath78 converge to one of the available attractors , after @xmath86 iterations , then @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the total number of initial conditions in every color - coded diagram .",

    "our calculations strongly indicate that in the vast majority of the cases the laplace distribution is the best fit to our data .",
    "the only two cases where the laplace distribution fails to fit the corresponding numerical data are the cases corresponding to the two critical values of the mass parameter @xmath0 ( see panels ( i ) in figs .",

    "one may observe that for most of the cases the location parameter @xmath155 is very close to the most probable number @xmath159 of iterations , while in some cases these two quantities coincide .",
    "here we would like to emphasize that the laplace distribution is only a first good approximation to our data .",

    "the scope of this research paper was to numerically determine the basins of convergence associated with the equilibrium points . in the perfbp with two equal masses the number , the position and the type of the libration points strongly depends on the value of the mass parameter @xmath0 . with the help of the multivariate version of the newton - raphson iterative scheme we managed to unveil the extraordinary and magnificent structures of the basins of attraction corresponding to the equilibrium points of the dynamical system .",
    "these basins play an important role as they describe how each point on the configuration @xmath1 plane is attracted by the libration points which act as attractors .",
    "our numerical exploration revealed how the position of the equilibrium points and of course the structure of the attracting areas are influenced by the mass parameter @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we related the several basins of attraction with the corresponding distribution of the required number of iterations . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such a thorough and systematic numerical investigation , regarding the basins of attraction , takes place in the perfbp and this is exactly the novelty as well as the importance of the current work .",
    "the main results of our numerical research are the following :    1 .",
    "we observed that the change on the value of the mass parameter @xmath0 mostly influences the shape and the geometry of the basins of attraction when @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , in this range it is almost impossible to know beforehand the structure of the attracting regions , as even a tiny change on the value of @xmath0 leads to a complete different structure on the @xmath1 plane . for larger values of @xmath0",
    "the influence of the same parameter on the attracting regions is much more milder .",
    "2 .   in all examined cases",
    "the area of the basins of convergence corresponding to the non - collinear libration points is finite . on the other hand , all four collinear equilibrium points can have infinite attracting domains .",
    "in particular , it was found that when @xmath117 each collinear attractor dominate in different ranges of the values of @xmath0 .",
    "the iterative method was found to converge very fast @xmath161 for initial conditions around each equilibrium point , fast @xmath162 and slow @xmath163 for initial conditions that complement the central regions of the very fast convergence , and very slow @xmath164 for initial conditions of dispersed points lying either in the vicinity of the basin boundaries , or between the dense regions of the equilibrium points .",
    "4 .   in general terms",
    "we concluded that the average value of required iterations @xmath110 for obtaining the desired accuracy decreases with increasing value of the mass parameter . in almost all cases ,",
    "the newton - raphson method , for more than 90% of the initial conditions , requires less than 60 iterations to converge to one of the available attractors .",
    "our calculations strongly suggest that non - converging points on the configuration @xmath1 plane exist only when @xmath160 .",
    "being more precisely , they appear mostly for values of @xmath0 just before the two critical values ( @xmath102 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "a deeper analysis on these points revealed the fact that these points are not true non - converging points .",
    "in reality they are extremely slow converging points which require a huge number of iterations @xmath165 in order to reach to one of the attractors .",
    "6 .   in the case where eight equilibrium points exist ( two collinear and six non - collinear ) we observed the highest degree of fractality , especially when @xmath152 . on the other hand , in the third case @xmath153 , where four collinear and four non - collinear equilibrium points exist , we measured the lowest degree of fractality .",
    "our tests indicate that our numerical data , corresponding to the histograms with the probability distributions of the required iterations , are best fitted by the laplace probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "only the cases just before the two critical values of the mass parameter ( which have long tails ) can not be fitted well by a laplace pdf .",
    "a double precision code , written in standard ` fortran 77 ` , has been deployed for performing all the required numerical calculations regarding the basins of convergence . for the graphical illustration of the paper , we used the latest version 11.0 of mathematica@xmath166 @xcite . for the classification of each set of the initial conditions on the several types of two - dimensional planes",
    ", we needed about 5 minutes of cpu time using a quad - core i7 2.4 ghz pc , depending of course on the required number of iterations . when an initial condition had converged to one of the attractors with the predefined accuracy",
    "the iterative procedure was effectively ended and proceeded to the next available initial condition .",
    "judging by the novel results revealed through the detailed and systematic numerical exploration we believe that we successfully completed our computational task .",
    "we hope that our investigation and the corresponding outcomes to be useful in the field of attracting domains in the perfbp .",
    "taking into account that the current analysis of the case with two equal masses was encouraging it is our future plans to study the general case with three unequal masses .",
    "in addition , it would be highly interesting to try and use other types of iterative formulae ( of higher order with respect to the classical newton - raphson method ) and compare the similarities as well as the differences of the structures of the basins of attraction .",
