    "electronic phase coherence often plays an important role in mesoscopic quantum transport .",
    "the simplest example , perhaps , is the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite in a mesoscopic ring which is manifested by dependence of conductance on enclosed magnetic flux and requires phase coherence across the ring . in the landauer - bttiker theory of quantum transport",
    "@xcite it is possible to simulate phase breaking scattering processes by including internal ` floating ' voltage probes in addition to source and drain @xcite electrodes , and requiring that their chemical potentials adjust so that they do not carry a current .",
    "this simple model is compatible with a green s function description of transport and is able to describe those qualitative consequences of inelastic scattering not associated with the peculiarities of a specific mechanism .",
    "it has , for example , been applied to study the influence of phase decoherence on spin - independent transport in one - dimensional systems @xcite , and the effect of dephasing on transport through quantum dots @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on a comparison of the influence of inelastic scattering on giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) and spin - transfer ( st ) torque effects in traditional spin - valve structures containing ferromagnetic metals , and in the antiferromagnetic spin - valve structures that we@xcite have recently proposed .",
    "( spin - valves are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . )",
    "these devices are normally intended for operation at room temperature and above and electron scattering is therefore normally dominantly inelastic . in traditional ferromagnetic spin - valves only spin - flip scattering in the paramagnetic spacer",
    "is expected to have a large impact on gmr@xcite or st@xcite .",
    "both effects are expected to be strong when the spin diffusion length is longer than the paramagnetic spacer thickness .",
    "( spin - independent inelastic scattering does however play a role in limiting the amplitude of oscillations in the dependence of exchange coupling between ferromagnetic layers on spacer layer thickness @xcite . )",
    "it is commonly believed that gmr and st in ferromagnetic spin - valves can survive arbitrarily strong spin - independent inelastic scattering . for antiferromagnetic spin - valves , however , the analogous effects depend@xcite , at least in a simple toy model , on coherent multiple - scattering in the spacer layer and at its interfaces with the antiferromagnets .",
    "we have therefore argued that both effects will become weak when inelastic scattering is strong , even if the scattering is spin - independent .",
    "since phonon scattering is only weakly spin - dependent and strong at high temperatures , inelastic scattering can not be ignored in practical antiferromagnetic spin valves .    to pursue these ideas more quantitatively",
    "we use a voltage probe model to represent the influence of spin - independent and spin - dependent inelastic scatterers in a green s function description of transport through a spin valve . in the linear response regime",
    "the voltage probe model has been shown to be equivalent to local coupling to a harmonic - oscillator heat bath @xcite . in a magnetic metal circuit ,",
    "however , conventional voltage probe models produce both longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation .",
    "consider for example a largely collinear magnetic configuration with a natural spin - quantization axis .",
    "spin components transverse to this axis are represented in quantum mechanics by coherence between spin - up and spin - down projections of the form @xmath0 .",
    "a conventional paramagnetic voltage probe will change the magnitude and randomize the phase of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 parts of this spinor independently and therefore alter all spin - density components .",
    "this property was used very recently by michaelis and beenakker to model spin decay in chaotic quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this feature is however undesirable in modelling the influence of inelastic scattering on magnetoresistance properties of spintronic devices , because the strongest inelastic scatterers are often phonons , and phonons conserve spin to a good approximation . in our calculations",
    "we therefore use a voltage probe model generalized to the case of ferromagnetic probes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this generalization allows us to consider separately spin - dependent and spin - independent inelastic scatterers .",
    "the spin - independent case is realized by adjusting the magnetization direction and the majority and minority spin chemical potentials of the voltage probes so that the probe carries neither charge or spin currents .",
    "there are a number of important distinctions between gmr and st physics in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic@xcite structures . in the ferromagnetic case gmr",
    "can be understood qualitatively simply by using a two - channel resistor model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] which does not rely on phase coherence .",
    "when applied to antiferromagnetic spin valves , the same argument does not predict gmr because the two spin channels have identical conductances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "clearly the antiferromagnetic spin - valve gmr effect relies at least in part on phase - coherence near the spacer layer as . in the simple model we discuss below antiferromagnetic spin - valve gmr",
    "comes about , roughly speaking , because the reflection amplitude for an electron scattering off an antiferromagnet is spin dependent , although the reflection probability and transmission amplitude and probability are not .",
    "similarly ferromagnetic spin - valve st torques can be understood by using a model of a ferromagnetic metal which has quasiparticle and magnetization orientation degrees of freedom , and appealing to conservation of total spin angular momentum to infer an action - reaction relationship between the torque exerted on the quasiparticles by the exchange field and the torque exerted on the magnetization by current - carrying quasiparticles . in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "it is the staggered moment antiferromagnetic order which behaves collectively .",
    "since this coordinate does not carry total spin , its current - driven dynamics is not specified by a global conservation law .",
    "the theory of current - driven order parameter dynamics in this case requires a more microscopic approach@xcite in which st is seen as following from changes in the spin - dependent exchange potential experienced by all quasiparticles , which follow in turn from changes in the spin - density in the presence of a transport current .",
    "indeed the use of the term _ spin transfer _ torque is perhaps inappropriate in the antiferromagnetic case since current - induced order parameter changes _ are not _ related to transfer of total spin angular momentum between subsystems .",
    "nevertheless staggered torques _",
    "act on the staggered spins and _ do _ drive drive the antiferromagnetic order parameter . to make clear that current - induced order parameter changes in antiferromagnets are not related to conservation of spin and are therefore strictly speaking not an example of spin transfer we , from now on , will call these torques _ current - induced torques _",
    "( cit s ) .",
    "remarkably , current - induced torques in an antiferromagnetic spin - valve act throughout the volume of the antiferromagnets in the absence of inelastic scattering and disorder . critical currents for order parameter reversal are therefore independent of antiferromagnetic film thickness in this limit , rather than being inversely proportional to thickness as in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to shed light on the robustness of these gmr and current - induced torques in realistic room - temperature thin - film antiferromagnetic spin - valve structures by examining how properties change upon introduction of spin - dependent and spin - independent inelastic scatterers .",
    "the ferromagnetic voltage probe models of elastic and inelastic scattering are completely satisfactory for this purpose because we are interested in achieving a qualitative understanding that transcends the details of specific systems .",
    "we solve the model using the green s function formalism for electronic transport in mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "this is convenient because the spin - torques we want to evaluate can be expressed@xcite in terms of the transport steady - state electron spin density and local observables are readily calculated using the green s function formalism .",

    "the ferromagnetic voltage probe model discussed in the previous section is a flexible tool which can be used to model a wide variety of potentially interesting spintronic device geometries .",
    "we use it in this section to model both spin - independent and spin - dependent inelastic scattering .    in the presence of an exchange field which defines a preferred direction in spin space",
    ", we can recognize ( at least ) three different length scales that are relevant to spintronic device functionality .",
    "the phase - coherence length @xmath84 is the length over which electronic quasiparticles maintain phase coherence .",
    "the spin - flip scattering length or spin diffusion length @xmath85 is the average distance travelled along the channel between spin - flip scattering events .",
    "this quantity usually controls the length scale on which the magnititude of the magnetization along the exchange field direction recovers local equilibrium , and therefore also the paramagnetic spacer layer thickness scale at which giant magnetoresistance effects are strongly attenuated .",
    "the spin - coherence length @xmath86 is the length scale over which components of the spin - density transverse to the exchange field can be maintained .",
    "the phase - coherence length is limited by spin - dependent inelastic scattering processes .",
    "in addition to this inelastic contribution , the spin - coherence length in two and three dimensional ferromagnetic metals tends to be short because of destructive interference due to the phase difference of the spinor components in transverse conduction channels@xcite with different fermi velocity components in the current flow direction .",
    "as we discuss below , phase coherence can have a strong influence on the properties of a spintronic circuit , especially in circuits containing antiferromagnetic elements .",
    "the solution of transport green s function models with ferromagnetic leads and non - collinear magnetization presents a number of numerical challenges , even for the one - dimensional case we consider here , because the spin and charge currents in the leads depend nonlinearly on both the magnetization direction and the magnitude of the exchange spin - splitting in each lead .",
    "when we wish to model a spin - independent inelastic scatterer , both the magnitude and the direction in each lead have to be carefully adjusted to achieve the zero - spin - current condition . indeed the case of spin - independent inelastic scatterers can be very relevant to experiment since phonon - scattering can be dominant in experimental systems . to model circumstances in which phonon scattering is dominant ( @xmath87 ) , we must deal with the complications associated with preventing spin - relaxation in the voltage probes , a requirement that is especially troublesome for non - collinear magnetization configurations .",
    "inelastic scattering off magnons , which does flip spins , can also be important however .",
    "the simplest case to examine numerically is one with paramagnetic , _",
    "i.e. _ spin - isotropic , voltage probes .",
    "calculations with this voltage probe model are relatively simple even for non - collinear magnetizations , since in this case only the charge current into the probes is set to zero .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath88 and can be interpreted as representing the case in which quasiparticle scattering from magnons is dominant .",
    "we start by considering the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) ratio which is easier to evaluate because we need to consider only parallel and antiparallel configurations which are both collinear .",
    "we define the gmr ratio as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the conductance for the parallel configuration and @xmath91 for the antiparallel one . for antiferromagnets , the designations _",
    "parallel _ and _ antiparallel _ refer to the moment directions on the two sites adjacent to the paramagnetic spacer .",
    "in our model we define the phase coherence length as the product of the fermi velocity and the inelastic scattering rate : @xmath92}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the fermi wave length of the system .",
    "this definition is motivated the fact that the inelastic scattering time is given roughly by @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "we report results for a spin - valve ferromagnetic nanostructure , which consists of two ferromagnetic elements separated by a paramagnetic spacer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this structure is known as a spin - valve because the current can be sharply reduced under favorable circumstances when the two ferromagnets have opposite orientations . in our toy model",
    "we choose @xmath95 and independent of position , _",
    "i.e. _ the site index @xmath3 , in the ferromagnetic parts of the system . in the paramagnetic parts the exchange potential",
    "is set to zero .",
    "both ferromagnets are @xmath96 sites long in our tight - binding model .",

    "independent inelastic scattering , the phonon scattering case , we choose @xmath100 .",
    "we then have to require that both spin and charge currents into the voltage probes vanish .",
    "as explained before , considering the non - collinear case for this situation is very difficult numerically .",
    "however , calculation of the gmr ratio requires comparing parallel and antiparallel configuration in which the spin currents with polarization out of the plane are zero .",
    "this observation makes calculating the gmr ratio numerically tractable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fm_gmr ] we present results for the gmr ratio as a function of spacer thickness for various inelastic scattering lengths .",
    "the gmr ratio exhibits oscillations as a function of spacer thickness which have been observed experimentally @xcite . for the phase coherent case",
    "these oscillations persist up to arbitrary large spacer thickness in our one - dimensional model . for finite @xmath84",
    "the oscillations are damped and the gmr ratio saturates to a nonzero value for a spacer of thickness much larger than @xmath84 .",
    "this is expected because for a ferromagnet the transmission and reflection probabilities are spin dependent , and not only the amplitudes .      for the magnon scattering case , @xmath102 , implemented by making the floating voltage probes paramagnetic and requiring the charge current to be zero , we are also able to consider the non - collinear case .",
    "the spin transfer torques are due to the net misalignment of electron spins with the local magnetization in the transport steady state @xcite , and calculated from @xmath103 here , @xmath104 denotes the electron spin component that points out of the plane spanned by the two magnetizations .",

    "note that as the phase coherence length decreases , the oscillations in the gmr ratio with increasing thickness are suppressed .",
    "unlike the case of a ferromagnetic spin valve , the gmr ratio goes to zero when the thickness of the spacer is much larger than the phase coherence length .",
    "this property demonstrates that phase coherence is essential for the antiferromagnetic gmr effect .",
    "this observation is in agreement with qualitative arguments presented in previous work @xcite .",
    "note however , that the gmr decreases rather gradually with decreasing phase coherence length .",
    "one of the most important results in our previous work on antiferromagnets @xcite is that in the ballistic limit the out of plane spin density which is responsible for the current - induced torque is periodic with the period of the antiferromagnet . for the tight - binding model used in this paper",
    "this property implies that this spin density component , present only in the transport steady state , is constant throughout the antiferromagnet .",

    "[ fig : sttafm ] we show the current - induced torque per current acting on the right antiferromagnet as a function of the angle @xmath105 between the two moments facing the paramagnetic spacer .",
    "it is important to realize that a single domain antiferromagnet is driven by a staggered torque .",
    "hence , in this case we have to calculate the staggered torque given by @xmath113 as expected , both gmr and current - induced torques are reduced by inelastic scattering .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the current - induced torques at @xmath114 are larger than at @xmath112 .",

    "we checked that in the limit @xmath115 the current - induced torques always vanish .",
    "the most important conclusion of this paper is that the introduction of inelastic scattering does not immediately destroy magnetoresistive and current - induced torques in nanostructures with two antiferromagnetic elements separated by a paramagnetic spacer . on the contrary , we find that the gmr ratio goes to zero smoothly for spacer thicknesses larger than the phase coherence or inelastic scattering length .",
    "( ab - initio calculations for cr / au / cr antiferromagnetic spin - valves@xcite demonstrate that there is an additional interface related contribution to antiferromagnetic gmr which is not captured by our toy model and is not limited by inelastic scattering in the spacer layer . ) since typical inelastic scattering lengths at room temperature ( @xmath116 ) are much larger than the minimum paramagnetic spacer layer thicknesses required to make coupling between magnetic layers insignificant , inelastic scattering does not impose any practical limitation on gmr and current - induced torques in thin film based antiferromagnetic metal nanostructures .",
    "unlike the ferromagnetic case , current - induced torques in antiferromagnets do not follow simply from the approximate conservation of total spin angular momentum .",
    "toy model calculations , as well as _ ab initio _ calculations for realistic systems@xcite , suggest that both gmr and current - induced torques tend to be somewhat weaker for very thin films in the antiferromagnetic case compared to gmr and spin transfer torques in ferromagnets .",
    "it seems natural to associate this property with the absence of grounding in a simple robust conservation law .",
    "a surprising and interesting property of st physics in antiferromagnets is the property that torques act throughout the entire volume of the antiferromagnet in the phase coherent case .",
    "this property helps to compensate for the tendency toward somewhat weaker effects in very thin films .",
    "when inelastic scattering is introduced , spin - torques again act only over a finite thickness @xmath117 within the antiferromagnets .",
    "still the length scale over which the torque acts should be @xmath116 , much longer than the atomic length scale over which spin torques act in ferromagnetic spin - torque structures .",
    "as explained in earlier work@xcite , st effects in antiferromagnets are expected to be strongest when moment directions alternate in the direction of current flow . in the one - dimensional single channel model studied here ,",
    "this is the only possibility . for real three - dimensional antiferromagnets",
    "this property requires particular orientations of current with respect to the crystal axes , or in thin film structures particular growth directions for the antiferromagnetic films which yield alternating ferromagnetic layers .",
    "it seems likely that the greatest obstacle to achieving interesting gmr and current - induced torques in purely antiferromagnetic circuits may be the difficulty in growing antiferromagnetic thin films with individual ferromagnetic layers that are not strongly compensated .",
    "studies of the influence of magnetic disorder within ferromagnetic layers on gmr and st physics require multi - channel green s function calculations and will be the subject of future work .",
