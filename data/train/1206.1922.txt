    "in a scattering problem the system is characterized by having a localized region of configuration space ( interaction region ) where the interaction is relevant , while elsewhere the interaction is absent .",
    "a particle is injected into the interaction region and experiences a scattering event ; after each event it may escape from the interaction region forever ( scattered trajectories ) or eventually proceed to another scattering event . a map that links some initial parameter to some feature of the outgoing state",
    "is called a scattering function",
    ". there may exist trapped trajectories , i.e. particles that wander for ever in the interaction region . in these circumstances the scattering function is not defined .",
    "a scattering process is called irregular or chaotic when a scattering function is singular on a fractal set of variable initial values ( see ref .  ) .",
    "a condition for having chaotic scattering is the existence of an invariant set  @xmath1  of an infinite number of unstable , periodic and aperiodic orbits , localized in the interaction region . whenever @xmath1  contains a cantor set ,",
    "irregular scattering occurs .",
    "in fact the stable manifolds of orbits in @xmath1 reach out into the asymptotic region by means of the hamiltonian flow ; an orbit started on one of the stable manifolds is captured in the interaction region for all the time , i.e. the final state is not defined .",
    "hence there exists a fractal set of asymptotic in - variables ( the initial conditions lie in the stable manifolds of orbits in  @xmath1 ) where the scattering function is singular @xcite .",
    "the pattern of homoclinic / heteroclinc connections of invariant manifolds of @xmath1 is called chaotic saddle.    therefore incoming parameters close to each other and close to the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle can be mapped to very different outgoing parameters .",
    "they spend a long time in the vicinity of @xmath1   and trace out the type of motion performed by the localized trajectories .",
    "similarly outgoing parameters close to each other and close to the unstable manifold can come from very different incoming parameters .",
    "@xmath1  acts as a  repeller  with global influence on the asymptotic region .",
    "therefore the scattering function displays wild fluctuations on all scales on each set containing initial conditions leading to trapped orbits .",
    "the origin of the fractal singularities of a scattering function is the chaotic motion in the invariant bound set ; the irregularity of the motion in an unbound phase space is connected to a form of bound chaos .",
    "thus , the main issue in studying a problem of chaotic scattering is to determine the properties of the invariant set , in particular the topological pattern of the chaotic saddle and the character of the dynamics in it . in this",
    "regard it is hoped that an equivalent symbolic dynamics is found out to explain the behavior of a scattering function .",
    "the invariant set provides a fractal structure whose dimension , lyapunov exponents and escape rate can be connected to the particular arrangement of the singularities in the scattering function or in the delay time function .",
    "the chaotic ( invariant ) set shows a relatively simple structure when it is completely hyperbolic . in this case",
    "it consists of unstable periodic orbits ( all of them are hyperbolic ) and their homoclinic and heteroclinic connections only .",
    "as smale shows @xcite , this is connected with the horseshoe construction .",
    "a system with @xmath2  fixed points ( periodic solutions ) corresponds to a horseshoe with the same number of fixed points ; one can obtain the horseshoe structure by plotting the invariant manifolds of any unstable periodic point .",
    "the invariant set may contain kam tori and sets of marginal stability ; in this case it is not completely hyperbolic and the horseshoe is not fully developed .",
    "we will present a system which differs from a standard smale s horseshoe model :    * the configuration space is infinite , the interaction is long ranged and parabolic orbits exist ; it follows that the invariant set is not compact and the system is described by a symbolic dynamics with an infinite number of symbols ; * in the phase space there are islands which consist of unbroken kam surfaces .",
    "many physical scattering systems can be modeled in the following way .",
    "we consider a set @xmath3 in the phase space .",
    "a driving force removes a fraction of points from @xmath3 after each step of an iterative process : after the first step , it leaves a number of intervals in @xmath3 , after the second step a set of new subintervals replaces each old interval",
    ". this process can be infinitely repeated .",
    "the structure of the set of points that are never removed is cantor - like .",
    "this process is characteristic of systems with fully developed chaos .    in chaotic scattering",
    "the smale s mechanism leads to an exponential decay of phase space ensembles : all phase space points are depleted except for the invariant set , which consists of all trapped orbits of the system .",
    "however the assignment of an exponential decay law to a chaotic dynamics is not general .",
    "when in the phase space some regular islands with kam surfaces survive , the particle initialized in a chaotic region can spend a long time near the boundary of a regular region . in this case",
    ", the leaving away of the particles from the kam region gives an algebraic decay @xcite .",
    "the existence of kam surfaces is not the only mechanism resulting in an algebraic decay . in the ref .",
    "the authors present a chaotic system that does not show any kam structures and that decays according to a power law .",
    "the scaling is explained through a model of random walk in phase space ; the dynamics of symbolic strings is markovian .",
    "beeker et al .",
    "@xcite observe an algebraic scaling of the scattering function .",
    "nevertheless they claim that the kam component effects are negligible for the parameter values they choose .",
    "beeker et al .",
    "provide reasons for the scaling by means of a different mechanism than the stickiness of kam tori .",
    "they consider the survival time of the temporarily bound orbits close to the parabolic orbit .",
    "if the system is described by a symbolic dynamics with infinite symbols , one can have a chaotic dynamics in a phase space without any regular region and , at the same time , a scaling with a power law .    when an external control parameter is varied , the invariant set changes its structure .",
    "in particular , if some non - hyperbolic components enlarge , then the stable and unstable bundles can be displaced one with respect to each other .",
    "for certain parameter values , intersections are destroyed and some localized orbits of the invariant set get lost , i.e. bifurcations take place . as a consequence ,",
    "the invariant set may be no longer topologically equivalent to a complete cantor set .",
    "some relevant quantities ( such as the escape rate and the topological entropy ) have general features : as functions of the parameter they display plateaux , where no orbits disappear .",
    "there is also a set of parameter values where the quantities change indicating the presence of bifurcations .",
    "this set can have an involved structure ; in fact for a class of systems the topological entropy exhibits a devil s staircase @xcite .",
    "there is a wide variety of applications of the chaotic scattering in classical physics .    in celestial mechanics complicated motions",
    "can take place for close encounters , but , after , the particles separate , with the exception of a set of initial conditions of zero measure @xcite .    in many chemical reactions ( in particular , in the case of a biatomic molecule interacting with an atom ) small changes in the initial conditions",
    "lead to drastic differences in the final states so that a nonreactive trajectory may exist in the vicinity of a reactive one .",

    "two couples of vortices that interact can either pass by each other or exchange their partners and then spend time moving along circular motion , until the next collision when they can either convert to the original couples or scatter away from each other .",
    "this capture state is unstable and exhibits all properties of chaotic scattering , and , in particular , it may be disrupted by a small change in the parameters .",
    "there are many applications of the chaotic scattering to the classical scattering problem by a potential .",
    "the heart of all examples is the existence of unstable , bounded orbits that trap a set of orbits in the continuum of the scattering trajectories and lead to singularities in the scattering functions @xcite . a particular class of problems",
    "is connected with the internal dynamics of atomic systems or clusters interacting with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "even if the motion is integrable in the field - free case , external driving generically destroys integrability and can lead to irregular dynamics , sensitive with respect to both initial conditions and parameters of the driver .",
    "this class of systems contains models of one - dimensional oscillating potential wells .    in this paper",
    "we deal with a representative of this class of systems : the model of rigid spheres @xcite .",
    "it is introduced in connection with the problem of the energy absorption in clusters irradiated by intense electromagnetic fields ; the model provides a basic mechanism of absorption .",
    "we focus on some features of the dynamics of the model .",
    "these features are understandable by means of a chaotic scattering approach .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and we list the particular cases we consider in the numerical study . in section 3 , we summarize the relevant numerical results about the scattering function and its structure of singularities ; the geometry of the scattering function is dominated by the escape orbits while the singularities are caused by the captured orbits .",
    "we show that the scaling of the delay time function is algebraic . in section 4 , following alekseev @xcite and ref .",
    "we introduce a return map and we obtain a detailed description of the structure of the scattering function . in section 5 , we give a different approach to the investigation of the structure of the scattering function .",
    "we construct the pattern of intersections of invariant manifolds of the two outermost fixed points .",
    "the singularities structure of the delay time function corresponds to the pattern in which the bundles of stable manifolds intersect the local segment of the unstable manifold .",
    "as smale has shown , the homoclinic / heteroclinic bundle is connected with a horseshoe construction .",
    "we obtain that the horseshoe map is not completely developed due to the non - hyperbolic effects created by the surfaces of kam islands and their secondary structures ; they cause the algebraic behavior in the statistics of the delay time function . in section 6 ,",
    "we investigate the outgoing energy as a function of the driver amplitude for fixed initial conditions .",
    "we observe that this function displays behaviors similar to the scattering function .",
    "this is interpreted through some essential properties of the topology of the homoclinic / heteroclinic bundle .",
    "the discrepancies between the two functions depend on secondary aspects of the topology .",

    "the phenomenology we study concerns drivers with strength even many times the maximal oscillator force .",

    "however there are some perturbative treatments ( in particular @xcite ) that show the important role of the escape orbit in the explanation of the irregular dynamics of the driven oscillators .",

    "at fixed strength of the driver , in the phase space there are size - able regions of initial conditions characterized by unstable trajectories which appear to be so erratic that the system motions can be regarded as stochastic . elsewhere , irregular motions are absent .",
    "in addition , if the strength of the driver is varied then stochastic regions move in the phase space .",
    "the properties of the dynamics can be approached by studying the scattering functions , i.e. maps connecting the initial states to the final ones , after a time long enough such that the particle can move in the interaction region and possibly comes out of it . in order to determine the scattering functions , we are interested in asymptotic data . for the case",

    "the graph of @xmath157 possesses the following hierarchical organization .",
    "consider the connection between @xmath157  and @xmath0 . in the graph @xmath44  of fig .",
    "[ fig : time - delay ]  we remove all continuous branches corresponding to the intervals with the lowest @xmath0 ; the @xmath157 structure is separated into substructures that are similar to the parent one ; each removed subinterval is surrounded by smaller subintervals with a higher value of @xmath157 ( castle - like structure ; see ref .  ) .",
    "we may iterate the procedure and the number of zeros fixes the level of cutting out ; at each step we get a generation of substructures similar to that of the previous generation . in this way",
    "we determine a hierarchical organization .",
    "it is important to observe that the pattern of gaps in a tendril ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tendril ] ) displays the same organization . in a tendril of order @xmath2 , whenever we cut a gap of order @xmath172  away",
    ", the pattern is separated into substructures , with gaps of higher order , similar to each other .",
    "we may iterate the method for gaps of higher order ; the hierarchy follows the order of the gap . in this way we establish a connection between the pattern of the delay time function and the structure of the @xmath0 scattering function ( compare @xmath45  and @xmath44 of  fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing - zeros ] ) .",
    "likewise the qualitative approach that refers the return map , in this section we have examined some features of the scattering function using global considerations on the dynamics ( the invariant manifolds of the fixed points @xmath162  and @xmath207 ) . in addition we have not needed to take into account all the chaotic invariant set .",
    "the horseshoe is incomplete and asymmetric ; the first order unstable gap ( tip @xmath214 ) does not reach the opposite side of the fundamental area .",
    "the numbers in the right column count all gaps up to order two .",
    "the horseshoe is characterized by the development parameters @xmath254  and @xmath255 . [",
    "fig : horseshoe - uncomplete],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in section 2 , we have checked an algebraic law both for @xmath38 , the decay with time of the number of temporarily bound orbits , and for  @xmath40 , the distribution of zeros .",
    "hyperbolic systems usually exhibit @xmath38  to have an exponential decay law @xcite . the algebraic decay would press to consider our system to be non - hyperbolic @xcite or ,",
    "if it were hyperbolic , there should be a special mechanism that makes the decay slower than what is expected when the kam tori structure is completely broken @xcite .",
    "our problem should fall in with the non - hyperbolic situation .",
    "in fact the poincar map shows orbits that curl up tori , i.e. there is a mixture of motion close to the deformed tori and motion far away from them .",
    "the presence of kam surfaces affects the particle motion in the nearby chaotic regions ; even if the particle starts in a chaotic region , sooner or later the particle approximates the surface and wanders close to it for a long time ; it is the `` stickiness effect '' .",
    "the motion in a kam surface is quasi - periodic and hence , nearby the tori , the lyapunov exponents in the directions along the surface are zero .",
    "moreover , in our case , the poincar map is symplectic ( the driver is periodic ) and , because it is two - dimensional , the lyapunov exponent perpendicular to the surface also has to be zero .",
    "the stickiness effect reduces the transport of orbits initialized in a chaotic region and explains the algebraic decay law instead of the exponential one . in the ref .",
    "it is established that the size of the decay depends on the complexity of the pattern of island chains : the more dominant the island chains in the chaotic region , the slower the escape process .",
    "we have remarked that in the ref .   an algebraic decay for the delay time function is obtained .",
    "nevertheless in this case the effects of the kam components are negligible .",
    "when we consider @xmath256 , @xmath257  for @xmath258 , the explanation of beeker et al .",
    ", applied to our case , supplies a decay law slower than the law we observe .",
    "the reasoning of beeker et al . attaches the most part of the importance to the orbits that spend the most part of time far away from the interaction region ; they are trajectories which almost escape after e.g. the @xmath2-th zero , but are eventually recaptured , so that there is a long time elapsing between the @xmath2-th and the @xmath259-th zero . because of the kam surfaces , in our case we have to take into account the orbits that run inside the interactions region .",
    "their life - time is shorter than that of the temporarily bound orbits close to the parabolic one ; in fact the energy absorptions mainly take place around the origin . on the basis of these considerations we expect the algebraic decay to be faster than the scaling determined by the class of orbits in the approximation of ref .  .",
    "in order to give a quantitative characterization of the development stage of the horseshoe construction a parameter @xmath170 ( development parameter ) was introduced in ref .  .",
    "for the system under consideration there are three most effective fixed point : the outermost ones and the inner elliptic fixed points .",
    "the development parameter for the corresponding horseshoe is @xmath260 ; @xmath2  is the highest order of the gap we consider and @xmath261  is the order of gap , which the tip of the first unstable gap reaches , when we count the gaps from the fixed point ( see ref .  ) .",
    "note , the value of @xmath170 does not depend on the choice of the order  @xmath2  we consider .",
    "the parameter allows to evaluate how deep the first order gap penetrates into the fundamental area of the horseshoe compared to the complete case ; in the development of a horseshoe the parameter @xmath170  varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "a horseshoe is complete whenever the unstable gap of order one reaches the opposite side of the fundamental area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : horseshoe ] ) ; in this case @xmath262 .",
    "the parameter is used to qualitatively characterize the topology of the homoclinic / heteroclinic tangle of the outer fixed points .",
    "it remains the same when under variations of physical parameters the changes of the topology concern tangencies of branches of manifolds of level high enough .",
    "it is important to point out the relation of @xmath170 to the topological entropy @xmath263 . in ref .",
    "it is obtained , by numerical computation , that @xmath263  is a monotonic function of @xmath170 .",
    "the parameter ignores the unique aspects of the kam surfaces ; it does not take into account the winding numbers of the elliptic points and neglects effects coming from the invariant manifolds that penetrate into the surroundings of the kam islands .",
    "however the parameter considers the part of the invariant set which is the most important for the scattering function .",
    "we focus on the fig .",
    "[ fig : stable - manifold ] .",
    "we observe that the inner non - hyperbolic island obstructs the penetration of the unstable gap in the fundamental area and keeps from the complete growth of the saddle pattern .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig : horseshoe - uncomplete ] is a schematic plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : stable - manifold ] ; the stable manifolds of @xmath162  and @xmath207  are plotted up to order two and @xmath220 of the point @xmath207 is plotted up to order one .",
    "the numbers in the right column count all gaps up to order two , consecutively from the top to the bottom .",
    "we note that the horseshoe is non - symmetric and hence it is incomplete .",
    "actually the first unstable gap of @xmath162  reaches the other side of the fundamental region ( it is the mirror image of @xmath264 ) and the unstable gap @xmath214 does not .",
    "the horseshoe is thus described by two development parameters .",
    "the parameter value of @xmath220 of @xmath207 is @xmath255 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider gaps up to second order ( @xmath265 ) the @xmath214  ends in the third gap from the top ( @xmath266 ) , thus leading to @xmath254 .    concerning the scattering problem , the effects of kam islands and their secondary structures should have little influence on the approximation of the horseshoe reconstruction :",
    "they are connected to the penetrations of the invariant manifolds of the outermost fixed points in the secondary structures around the kam islands . in non - hyperbolic case",
    "the kam component obstructs a full development of the horseshoe .",
    "in contrast to the complete horseshoe ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tendril ] )  in the incomplete case some inner gaps in a tendril can disappear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : horseshoe - uncomplete ] ) .",
    "however the non transversal intersections between stable and unstable manifolds due to kam tori have small effects on the scattering functions @xcite , i.e. on the structure of the intersections between the stable manifold and the local segment of the unstable manifold . for @xmath267  and",
    "@xmath42   there are tangencies for gaps of order @xmath268 .",
    "the effects of the tangencies are visible on the scattering functions at the order @xmath269 ; in fact whenever the @xmath2-th order stable gap is tangent to the @xmath2-th unstable gap then the @xmath259-th order stable gap intersects the @xmath270-th unstable gap and , finally , the @xmath271-th stable gap intersects the local segment at the @xmath271-th tendril .",
    "in this section we fix the initial conditions and vary the parameter @xmath19 . we know",
    "( see ref .  )",
    "that a scattering system can experience transitions from regular to chaotic scattering as a parameter of the system is varied .",
    "the onset of chaotic scattering can be achieved through combination of bifurcation mechanisms : new periodic orbits are added and their stable and unstable manifolds intersect each other .",
    "these events cause changes in the chaotic set ; as the parameter is varied the hyperbolic component increases and the formation of structures topologically equivalent to a horseshoe may occur .",
    "we do not address the question of how the chaotic scattering arises as @xmath19  changes .",
    "we only discuss the qualitative behavior of the outgoing energy of a trajectory with given initial conditions .",
    "we argue that the main properties are connected to the invariant pattern caused by the outermost fixed points .",
    "we consider both the periodic case ( @xmath13 ) and the finite duration driver ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the initial conditions are set @xmath41 and  @xmath272 ( @xmath273  at @xmath147 ) .    in the case of @xmath12",

    "[ fig : scattering - function-3 ] ) : @xmath275 for the periodic driver we introduce the one - to - many values mapping : @xmath276 @xmath277 , @xmath278 ; the map links @xmath19  to  the energies @xmath279 , every driver period . in all cases",
    "we obtain patterns that display some of the features of the maps investigated above :    * there is a sequence of alternating regular and irregular intervals of @xmath19 . * a magnification of an irregular interval shows a pattern similar to the complete one ( see @xmath44  of fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering - function-3 ] ) . * except for very few cases a regular interval corresponds to a determined number of crossings of @xmath35 ( or number of steps in the fundamental region .",
    "see @xmath61  of fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering - function-3 ] ) .    we should point out that , differently from sect .",
    "@xmath280 , the hierarchy of the regular intervals with respect to @xmath0 , the number of crossings of @xmath35 ,  does not completely hold .",
    "in fact , there are some regular intervals where @xmath0 changes value ( see the jump  from @xmath281  to @xmath282  of the regular interval at the left hand side of the plot @xmath76  of fig .  [",
    "fig : scattering - function-3 ] and the jump from @xmath283  and @xmath284 of the regular interval @xmath285 $ ] ) .    displays the asymptotic - out energy ( @xmath34 ) vs the driver amplitude ( @xmath19 ) for @xmath12 .",
    "the plot @xmath44 is a magnification of the marked interval of @xmath45 .",
    "the plot @xmath76 shows @xmath0 corresponding to the interval of @xmath19  in the plot @xmath61 [ fig : scattering - function-3],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we come back to the horseshoe construction that is traced out by the invariant manifolds of the outermost fixed points .",
    "we have stated that , for fixed @xmath19 , the topology of homoclinic / heteroclinic intersections determines the structure of a scattering function corresponding to a line of initial conditions which cuts tendrils of the stable manifold close to the local branch .",
    "we want to explain what occurs when we fix the initial conditions and vary @xmath19 . by changing @xmath19  the length of manifolds",
    "is affected and homoclinic bifurcations take place whenever the branches of two manifolds cross each other . accordingly",
    "the invariant set changes its topology and some orbits may get lost .",
    "consider @xmath45 of fig .",
    "[ fig : horseshoe - bifurcation ] : a tip @xmath214 reaches into a stable gap that , we know , is free of further gap of @xmath219 , and the tips @xmath217  and @xmath286   lie in the areas of tendrils . in these situations stretching or compression of segments of manifolds",
    "do not cause any tangencies .",
    "if this is the case for the tips of all gaps up to order @xmath2  then , even if we vary @xmath19  over a suitable interval , the corresponding changes of the topology may affect only orbits with at least @xmath2  iterates in the fundamental region .",
    "this implies a stability of a part of the structure of orbits against bifurcations .",
    "displays an incomplete horseshoe where the tips @xmath214 , @xmath286  and @xmath217 enter areas where they can not hit invariant manifolds . in the plot ( b )",
    "the same tips can undergo tangencies under small changes of @xmath19.[fig : horseshoe - bifurcation],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    on the other hand a tip that exits a gap can undergo a homoclinic tangency for small changes of @xmath19 ( see @xmath44  of fig . [",
    "fig : horseshoe - bifurcation ] ) . in the fundamental region ,",
    "the structure of the gaps , that is kept fixed over an interval of @xmath19 , resembles the structure of homoclinic / heteroclinic intersections that is `` seen '' by a line of initial conditions , as long as we consider orbits with a number of steps in @xmath208 not too large .",
    "the second structure is connected to the pattern of gaps in a tendril .",
    "we conclude that the structure of singularities of the maps @xmath287 , @xmath58 , should resemble to the scattering functions with respect to a line of initial conditions .",
    "an essential observation is that there are parameter intervals in which the tips of the invariant manifolds do not create homoclinic bifurcations under small changes of the parameter .",
    "this occurs due to the gaps which are empty of invariant manifolds .",
    "it should be pointed out that the idea of the gaps may be helpful only if it is applied to a system with an open , infinite phase space ( scattering systems ) .",
    "in fact in a bound hamiltonian system the invariant manifolds are dense in a connected subset of the phase space not containing kam tori .",
    "we have studied a one - dimensional oscillator , with a single equilibrium point and critical points at infinity , driven by a force that is either periodic or lasting a finite time interval .    by numerical simulations",
    "we have determined maps of scattering data ( energy , delay time ) and number of zeros of the orbits as functions of an initial condition ( the other initial condition and the driver amplitude being kept fixed ) and of the driver amplitude ( the initial conditions being fixed ) .",
    "the maps display a characteristic pattern .",
    "the outgoing variables are smooth functions in intervals where the number of zeros @xmath0 of the solutions does not vary ; @xmath0  marks each interval .",
    "successive removal of all the smooth intervals with @xmath288  leads to a set of singularities that appears to be cantor - like and corresponds to trajectories that never escape .",
    "the number of zeros plays the role of an order parameter that corresponds to a hierarchical structure of the regular intervals .",
    "the same ordering is provided by the delay time function .",
    "this property is connected to the structure of gaps in a tendril , i.e. the area that is enclosed between a branch of the stable manifold and the local segment of the unstable manifold and that reaches out the fundamental area into the incoming asymptotic region .",
    "the regular intervals and the singularities pattern of the maps @xmath289 , @xmath58 , are understood through the gaps in the fundamental area : some regions of phase space are void of invariant manifolds and homoclinic - heteroclinic intersections can not take place even if a change of a parameter can produce stretching or compression of manifolds .",
    "we introduce a map ( return map ) which is defined in a plane @xmath96  and describes the dynamics of the crossings of @xmath35 . through the map we can identify a pattern of subsets in @xmath96  whose structure is connected to the structure of the scattering map .",
    "the number of orbits as a function of the time of permanence close to the origin decreases slower than expected : it decreases as a power law rather than exponentially .",
    "the explanation is due to the fact that the invariant structures are not completely destroyed : some cantor tori remain , and a reduction in the number of orbits close to the origin is due to a stickiness effect .",
    "these orbits starting far from a torus end up near it and remain there , creating correlations between different orbits and therefore decreasing the chaotic effect ."
