    "although the standard model ( sm ) @xcite has been repeatedly confirmed by high energy experiments , there are still a number of theoretical problems unsolved , providing strong motivations to search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "as one of them , the fine - tuning problem of the higgs boson @xcite has become even more attractive after the discovery of the @xmath5 higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite . to regulate quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass , many extended models are proposed . among them , the little higgs models @xcite deserve attention due to their constructions as one kind of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) without fine - tuning problem .",
    "the higgs boson in these models manifests as a nambu - goldstone boson corresponding to a new global symmetry , which guarantees the lightness of the higgs boson through its spontaneous breaking at a higher scale @xmath6 .",
    "the most economical version of the little higgs models is the littlest higgs model ( lhm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sm particle spectrum , a set of new heavy gauge bosons @xmath7 , a colored vector - like quark @xmath8 and a scalar triplet @xmath9 are introduced in the lhm .",
    "unfortunately , the original construction of the lhm conflicts severely with precision electroweak constraints @xcite , forcing the value of @xmath6 to be as large as several tev .",
    "the fine - tuning between the cutoff scale @xmath10 and the weak scale will be needed again for a too large @xmath6 value .",
    "this problem can be solved naturally when the lhm is endowed a discrete symmetry named @xmath0-parity . in the littlest higgs model with @xmath0-parity ( lht ) ,",
    "newly introduced particles are odd under @xmath0-parity except @xmath11 , while the sm particles are @xmath0-even .",
    "@xmath0-parity conservation makes the @xmath0-odd particles can only be produced in pairs , and the sm gauge bosons can not mix with their @xmath0-partners .",
    "hence the new particles do not contribute to the electroweak precision observables at tree level , then all such corrections from new particles are loop suppressed and small .",
    "all of these allow a relatively low value of @xmath6 . according to the latest results from the @xmath12",
    "run at the lhc , the constraints from higgs couplings are by now competing with electroweak precision tests and both combined exclude @xmath6 up to @xmath13 or @xmath14 depending on the implementation of the down - type yukawa sector @xcite . with the new particles and a relatively low value of @xmath6",
    ", rich phenomena of the lht can be expected at the lhc .",
    "another interesting thing predicted in the lht is that the neutral and colorless weakly interacting stable @xmath0-odd @xmath15 can be a good candidate for dark matter , which is also one of the problems unsolved in current particle physics .",
    "the phenomenological study in the lht is extensive .",
    "a study on phenomenology of the lht including effects of @xmath0-odd fermions at tree level was reported in ref.@xcite .",

    "calculations on a @xmath0-odd gauge boson production associated with a @xmath0-odd heavy quark at the lhc at the qcd nlo were presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the production of same - sign dileptons via sm mechanism at the lhc is rather rare , therefore , it is a very helpful to choose the same - sign dilepton production to search for the evidence of the lht .",
    "both the atlas and cms collaborations have adopted same - sign dilepton events to search for new physics at the @xmath18 lhc ( lhc7 ) and the @xmath19 lhc ( lhc8 ) @xcite . by analyzing these signatures and other events from the atlas at the lhc8 , j. reuter , _ et al . _ provided robust and complementary lht limits and constrained @xmath6 to be larger than @xmath20 @xcite . in this work",

    "in this section , we introduce briefly the lht theory related to our study . for",
    "the detailed lht theory one can refer to the literatures .",
    "the lht is a nonlinear @xmath22 model based on a @xmath23 global symmetry , in which a subgroup @xmath24 \\times [ su(2)_2 \\times u(1)_2]$ ] is gauged . at an energy scale of @xmath25 ,",
    "the @xmath23 global symmetry spontaneously breaks down to its @xmath26 subgroup . this symmetry breaking originates from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of an @xmath23 symmetric tensor field @xmath27 , written as @xmath28 this breaking gives rise to 14 nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .",
    "simultaneously , the gauged symmetry @xmath24 \\times [ su(2)_2 \\times u(1)_2]$ ] breaks down to the sm @xmath29 symmetry .",
