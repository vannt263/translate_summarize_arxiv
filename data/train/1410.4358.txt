    "distance measurements are more difficult to obtain than just @xmath5 and @xmath6 and hence the number of galaxies with observed peculiar motions is significantly smaller than in redshift surveys .",
    "an example of the first set is two micron all sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ) @xcite , of about 45000 galaxies with a mean redshift of @xmath9 and the deeper sdss containing about half a million galaxies but with partial sky coverage .",

    ", width=508 ]    while the galaxy distribution is a biased tracer of the underlying mass density field of the dominant dark matter , the equivalence principle implies that galaxies are comoving with the dark matter on large scales away from non - gravitational forces .",
    "but the peculiar velocity field ( as a function of the measured distance , @xmath7 ) derived from the noisy data suffers from inhomogeneous malmquist biases @xcite , resulting from the systematic difference between @xmath7 and the mean of true distances of galaxies with the same @xmath7 .",
    "it is very difficult to correct for this bias because of its dependence on the unknown distribution of galaxies in true distance space .",
    "in contrast , galaxy biasing is likely to be well approximated by a simple linear relation @xmath13 between the galaxy and dark matter density fluctuations , as seen in fig .",

    "the equations of motion ( eom ) of the perturbations are the usual euler , poisson and continuity equations in an expanding background . supplemented with initial conditions appropriate for cosmological perturbations ,",
    "the full solution to the eom is possible only via numerical simulations which have achieved an impressive dynamical range from small galaxies to a significant fraction of the hubble volume .",
    "nonetheless , approximate solutions have been and will remain the basis for observational analyses methods and a physical understanding the numerical results .",
    "the simplest approximate solution is provided by linear theory which yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 describes a decaying mode and the growing mode obeys @xmath24 .",
    "linear theory also yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the growth rate and @xmath27 is the 3d peculiar velocity field .",
    "the index @xmath28 depends on the cosmology ( e.g. through the dark energy model ) and the underlying theory for gravity .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath29 is one of the goals of future large surveys of galaxies .",
    "this @xmath30 has been used extensively for the prediction of velocity fields associated with the distribution of galaxies in a given redshift survey .",
    "it is the basis for modeling redshift distortions of correlation functions from redshift surveys on large scales .    within gi the two independent data sets",
    "can be analyzed in several ways : @xmath31 correlation functions ( and power spectra ) have been estimated from the distribution of galaxies in redshift surveys .",
    "these correlations can be compared with predictions of cosmological models .",
    "further , @xmath32 implies that correlations in redshift space indirectly probe @xmath8 through the fingers of god effect on small scales and the enhancement of clustering on large scales @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 correlation analysis of the observed peculiar velocity field have also been done . however , this analysis is intrinsically plagued with inhomogeneous malmquist biases .",

    "this comparison is particularly important since it minimizes cosmic variance in the estimation of the cosmological parameters .",
    "full analytic solutions to the eom are available only for initial conditions with a high degree of symmetry , e.g. self - similar collapse / expansion with planar , cylindrical or spherical symmetry .",
    "@xcite proposed a remarkably simple approximation for the evolution of generic cosmological perturbations in the quasi - linear regime ( laminar flow ) .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( za ) states that the current position @xmath37 and the initial lagrangian coordinate , @xmath38 , of a particle are related by @xmath39 in the paper , zeldovich considered only baryons and argued that the natural perturbation scale is the silk damping mass scale , @xmath40 .",
    "further , the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath41 , revealed a preference for planar - like perturbations .",
    "hence , za was the basis for the top - down pancake paradigm for structure formation .",
    "the approximation ( [ eq : zeld ] ) is an exact solution to the full eom for planar perturbations up to the onset of shell crossing ( in collision - less fluids ) .",
    "the proof appears in @xcite , but not in the 1970 paper .",
    "although not highly accurate the za has given us fantastic physical insight into the working of nonlinear dynamics , e.g. the growth of angular momentum of galaxies @xcite , nonlinear density power spectrum with and without redshift distortions @xcite and the probability distribution of the density field @xcite .      here , the displacement is expanded in a taylor series in an appropriate parameter @xcite which can be taken as the linear growth factor , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 , where the za term ( @xmath44 ) is entirely fixed by the initial conditions , while the eom dictate all @xmath45 terms via a recurrence relation involving lower order terms only @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these recurrence relations become messy for @xmath46 .",
    "one of the reasons for that is the emergence of non - vanishing lagrangian vorticity @xmath47 for @xmath46 .",
    "second order lagrangian perturbation ( 2lpt ) ( @xmath48 ) , gives the density as @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the eigenvalues of @xmath51 .",
    "the continuity equation yields the widely known expression for the density in the za , @xmath52 the za and 2lpt share the algebraic form of the second order term ( @xmath53 ) , but with different coefficients .",
    "thus , za is inaccurate even to second order .",
    "however , simulations show that the za provides a better match to the density derived from the velocity in @xcite in high density regions , although 2lpt is better for low densities",
    ".    one of the most important common application of these approximation is the generation of particle displacements and velocities to be used as initial conditions for n - body simulations . the za and 2lpt",
    "are traditionally used but the latter yields is more accurate for this purpose .",
    "we are given the positions of mass tracers ( galaxies ) today .",
    "what are the tracers paths from the nearly homogeneous early universe to the current configuration ?",
    "this is _ a boundary value problem _ where a solution to the equations of motion is sought for _ boundary conditions _ ( bc ) at two different times .",
    "its solution allows a reconstruction of the velocity field associate with the observed distribution of tracers and also the initial density field which lead to this distribution through gravitational interactions .",
    "za and 2lpt can be employed to derive approximate solutions to the orbits",
    ". however , the most general ( and elegant ) method to do that has been designed by @xcite based on the least action principle .",
    "orbits , @xmath54 , obeying the eom also render the action stationary with respect to variations , @xmath55 , satisfying the bc @xmath56 at the limiting times @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the momentum . in the cosmological problem",
    ", @xmath60 is naturally imposed .",
    "the initial positions are unknown , but peebles noted that for the growing mode of cosmological perturbations the momentum vanishes as @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the solutions to the cosmological boundary value problem can be obtained by minimizing the action with respect to trial orbits constructed to satisfy @xmath2 known current positions and @xmath33 @xmath62 near the big bang . for sufficiently general trial functions",
    "the orbits should be a solution to the full equations satisfying the bc , should such a solutions exist . in general ,",
    "boundary value problems allow for multiple solutions or no solutions at all .",
    "consider for example the linear oscillator @xmath63 subject to the bc , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "there is an infinite number of solutions : @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "there are also bc where the action has no extremum orbit .",
    "an example is @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "there is no physical orbit which satisfies these bc . in this case",
    ", it is easy to see that action can acquire infinitely large ( positive and negative ) values for certain choices of the orbits . for mixed bc where one of the conditions is @xmath70 ,",
    "the situation can even be more intriguing .",
    "the oscillator equation of motion constrained to @xmath71 and @xmath69 , is solved by @xmath72 .",
    "let us compute the action @xmath73 for the following choice for the perturbed orbits : @xmath74 .",
    "these orbits satisfy the bc for @xmath75 , but not the equation of motion .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath76 , i.e. the extremum point is a maximum for @xmath77 and a minimum for @xmath78 .",
    "the lg contains about a dozen known galaxies within a distance @xmath79 mpc .",
    "although not a virialized object ( see below ) , it is gravitationally bound and detached from the expansion .",
    "galaxy members ( excluding satellites ) of the lg are shown in fig .",
    "the mw and m31 are by far the most luminous ( m31 is 100 more luminous than ngc6822-the third most luminous galaxy shown in the figure ) .",
    "the radial velocities in the lg frame are represented by the arrow in the figure .",
    "the ( radial ) velocity dispersion is @xmath80 and the flow pattern clearly reveals a non - virialized system that is most likely is on a first infall .",
    "thus , the virial theorem will over - estimate the total mass of the lg .",
    "to constraint the masses of mw and m31 , we apply the action principle to the nearby galaxies .",
    "the application is basically a generalization of the timing argue ( ta ) of woltjer and kahn who considered only the mw and m31 . by treating the two galaxies as point particles with zero angular momentum ( relative to the center of mass )",
    ", ta constrains the total mass @xmath81 by demanding that the two galaxies originated from zero separation a hubble time ago , reaching their current separation and relative velocity today .",
    "the action method breaks the degeneracy between the masses by including kinematical observations of the smaller members of the lg .",
    "although dynamically unimportant , the observed distances and velocities of these galaxies will allow us to resolve the individual masses @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "galaxy orbits which render the action stationary are found iteratively using standard techniques .",
    "they are verified as solutions to the eom in a leapfrog approximation .",
    "since the solutions are non - unique , different choices of initial trial orbits will generally give different solutions for the galaxy paths .",
    "we define a @xmath84 measure of fit for all relevant observables , from which a best - fit solution can be selected .",
    "maps of @xmath84 in four different scenarios , all with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at upper left",
    "are the contours in @xmath84 generated from a simplified catalog consisting of only mw and m31 , to check the consistency of the action method with the timing argument .",
    "as expected , we find a well - defined constraint on the sum @xmath87 .",
    "the upper right panel , shows the results from a reduced version of our catalog which includes the lg actors but excludes external galaxies .",
    "the additional dynamical actors has broken the degeneracy in the ta , giving independent masses of @xmath88 for the mw and @xmath89 for m31 . with the addition of the external galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , lower left ) , the best mass for the mw increases to @xmath89 .",
    "this is consistent at the lower end with previous ta measurements of the total lg mass and the individual mw mass . when the transverse velocity constraints on m31 , lmc , m33 , ic10 , and leoi are added ( lower right ) , the confidence intervals are broadened and the best - fit mass for mw decreases slightly , to @xmath90 , reflecting the fact that lower masses for mw are correlated to lower transverse velocities for m31 and other nearby galaxies .",
    "these values are to be understood as the masses contained within roughly half the separation between the two galaxies . for the mw ,",
    "the value is more than twice what stellar motions yield for its virial mass .",
    "this could pose a challenge to the standard model since such an increase of the mass is not seen in n - body simulations .     for different values of mw and m31 masses .",
    "upper left : results from the two - body problem of mw + m31 .",
    "upper right : lg actors only .",
    "lower left : lg actors + four external groups .",
    "lower right : same as lower left , with transverse velocity constraints included for five nearby galaxies .",
    "the first contour level ( solid black line ) marks the region of 95% confidence . from @xcite . ]",
    "restricting the analysis to these scales , away from non - linearities and hydrodynamical effects , greatly simplifies observational analyses of observations .",
    "linear theory dynamical relations are , by and large , adequate on these scales but with the inclusion of scatter as a result from the presence of small scale modes .",
    "further , large scale galaxy biasing is well described by a linear relation , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "@xcite have shown that gi passes a very important test : an excellent agreement between the velocity field predicted from the distribution of galaxies via linear theory and the observed motions of galaxies obtained from the tf measurements of spiral galaxies .",
    "the beauty of this test is that the effects of cosmic variance are minimized ( in principles two good measurements are enough ) .",
    "the contribution of marc davis to these proceedings offers more details .",
    "the cmb temperature dipole together with astronomical estimation of the lg motion relative to the sun , provide @xmath91 toward @xmath92 for the lg motion relative to the cmb frame .",
    "the lg is accelerated by the cumulative gravitational pull of the surrounding large scale structure .",
    "therefore , an important probe of the gi paradigm is whether the observed large scale structure , as traced by the galaxy distribution , could indeed account for the lg motion . to do that",
    ", we need to compute the gravitational force on the lg from an all sky survey of galaxies .",
    "according to linear theory , this force should be proportional to the lg motion .",
    "we use the 2mrs which is the deepest nearly - all sky survey of angular positions and spectroscopic galaxy redshifts limited to @xmath93 and arguably the best sample of objects to estimate the lg motion .    a source of uncertainty",
    "is the error in the linear theory dynamical reconstruction of the velocity from a given density field ( equation [ eq : lin ] ) . to assess this error we have estimated the lg motion from the full dark matter out to the largest possible outer radius in the simulation , i.e. @xmath94 . the corresponding @xmath95 error , @xmath96 , is substantially smaller that the typical error in linear reconstruction of the peculiar velocity of a generic observer in the universe .",
    "the reason for this is the strict criteria we have applied in selecting the `` lg observer '' in the mock catalogs , aimed at matching the quietness and moderate density environment of the observed lg .",
    "removing these selection criteria boosts the error to @xmath97 , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "nonlinear dynamical reconstruction methods can potentially reduce the dynamical error .",
    "however , because the particular environment of the lg , errors due to linear reconstruction are subdominant compared to the total error budget .    for a more realistic assessment of the recovery of the lg motion in real data",
    "we resort to mock catalogs designed to match the 2mrs with @xmath98 ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the results for various cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , as described in the caption .",
    "there is a dramatic decrease in the scatter when matter within @xmath94 is included .",
    "still the residuals are at the level of @xmath99 depending on the case considered .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who derived a similar result analytically .",
    "current all sky data do not allow a reliable assessment of the contribution of fluctuations beyond @xmath100 .",
    "much of that is because of the kaiser rocket effect @xcite ( see @xcite for further details ) .     and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the _ rms _ of the parallel and perpendicular residuals are indicated , respectively , in the left and right panels . , width=336 ]      the bulk flow , @xmath102 , is the mean motion of a sphere of a given radius , @xmath103 .",
    "computing @xmath104 from the sparse and noisy peculiar velocity catalogs is very challenging .",
    "improper handling of the data may easily lead to artificially large flow . @xcite",
    "have estimated @xmath105 from the sfi++ survey .",
    "they have discarded @xmath2 the fainter galaxies which do not obey the tf relation and @xmath33 galaxies beyond 100@xmath106 which are likely to suffer from systematics related to the measurements of tf parameters .",
    "they found @xmath102 to be consistent with the standard @xmath107cdm model and derived the constraint : @xmath108 , which leads to a @xmath109 higher ( although consistent with ) than the wmap value .",
    "however , taking @xmath110 from the recent planck results , yields a best fit value @xmath111 , very close to the result reported by the planck collaboration . despite earlier claims of anomalous bulk flows ,",
    "the emergent consensus is that bulk flow measurements from numerous data ( intrinsic relations , sn and ksz ) , is consistent with the standard @xmath107cdm model .",
    "the gravitational instability model for structure formation with its current @xmath107cdm incarnation described the nearby large scale structure very well .",
    "whatever corrections for this model should be small as far as large scales are concerned . probing deviations from this model on large scales maybe possible only with next generation redshift surveys .",
    "modifications on smaller scales ( @xmath112 a few mpcs ) are a different matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but are not the subject of this contribution .",
    "upcoming redshift surveys will contain a large number of galaxies to allow constraints on the cosmological velocity field independently of the classical redshift distortion the correlation functions .",
    "the idea is that galaxy redshifts @xmath5 depend on @xmath8 .",
    "hence , using @xmath5 instead of true distances , @xmath113 , in order to estimate galaxy luminosities ( from the observed apparent magnitudes ) will introduce spatial variations of the luminosity function .",
    "assuming negligible environmental dependence in the luminosity function , these variations can put constraints on the velocity field .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "basically this method assumes that galaxy luminosity is a standard candle where the very large distance error is beaten by the large number of galaxies .",
    "the method can be applied to surveys with photometric redshifts @xcite and is not restricted to spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the method can constrain galaxy biasing and the the linear growth rate is a velocity model based on the actual galaxy distribution is used to model the luminosity variations .",
    "the contribution of martin feix addresses potential caveats and presents an application to the sdss .",
    "another potential probe is offered by gaia",
    ". there could be a large number of galaxies detected as point sources by gaia @xcite .",
    "for example , the nuclei of m87 and n5121 ( both at d=17.8mpc ) should be detected with an end of mission accuracy of @xmath114 in the transverse motion .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the carnegie - irvine galaxy survery show that 70% of galaxies in this survey could be detected by gaia .",
    "the majority of these nearby galaxies will be detected if placed at @xmath115 ( early type ) and @xmath116 ( late type ) .",
    "of course , parallax distance errors increase quadratically with distance .",
    "therefore , the error on gaia s distances for extragalactic objects will be huge and can not be used to get the transverse velocities from the measured proper motions .",
    "but , at such distances , the redshifts can be used as proxies for the true distance without introducing a significant error in the transverse velocities ."
