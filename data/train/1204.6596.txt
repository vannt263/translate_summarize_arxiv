    "quantum entanglement is now considered as the main key resource for applications to quantum information and quantum computation theory .",
    "one of the major research topics in the theory of entanglement is , of course , how to distinguish entanglement from separable states . for this purpose ,",
    "positive linear maps are known to be the most complete tools @xcite among various criteria .",
    "this criterion for separability using positive maps is equivalent to the duality theory @xcite between positivity of linear maps and separability of block matrices , through the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism @xcite . in this sense , we need a positive linear map to detect entanglement .",
    "this is formulated as the notion of entanglement witness @xcite that is just a positive linear map which is not completely positive , under the isomorphism .",
    "we refer to @xcite for systematic approaches to the duality using the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism .",
    "an entanglement witness which detects a maximal set of entanglement is said to be optimal , as was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the notion of optimality may be explained in terms of facial structures of the convex cone @xmath0 consisting of all positive linear maps between matrix algebras .",
    "in fact , it was shown @xcite that a positive map @xmath1 is an optimal entanglement witness if and only if the smallest face of @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has no completely positive linear map .",
    "see also ref .",
    "therefore , the most natural candidates of optimal entanglement witnesses are extremal positive maps which are not completely positive . in spite of its importance , the facial structure of the cone @xmath0 is very far from being understood even in the low dimensional cases .",
    "when both the domain and the range are the @xmath2 matrix algebra , all extreme points of the convex set consisting of unital positive maps had been found in the sixties @xcite .",
    "the whole facial structures of this convex set is completely understood by the second author @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "another sufficient condition for optimality is the notion of the spanning property , as was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is very useful , because the spanning property is much easier to verify than the optimality itself .",
    "it turns out @xcite that a positive map @xmath1 has the spanning property if and only if the smallest exposed face of the cone @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has no completely positive map .",
    "recall that a convex subset @xmath3 of a convex set @xmath4 is said to be a face if the following condition holds : if a convex combination of two points @xmath5 belongs to @xmath3 then @xmath6 and @xmath7 themselves belong to @xmath3 .",
    "a face @xmath3 of @xmath4 is said to be an exposed face if it is the intersection of @xmath4 and a hyperplane .",
    "we will see an example of a face which is not exposed through the discussion .",
    ". 1 .    for the decomposable case ,",
    "several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for optimality are known , and there are progresses to characterize optimal decomposable entanglement witnesses .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples . in the case of indecomposable entanglement witnesses ,",
    "a condition for optimality has been found @xcite recently , and examples of optimal entanglement witnesses without the spanning property were given . nevertheless , we have still few kinds of examples for optimal entanglement witnesses arising from indecomposable maps .",
    "we note that the choi type positive maps are one of the main resources for indecomposable positive maps .",
    "the primary purpose of this note is to analyze those maps between @xmath8 matrix algebras , and examine the relations between extremeness , spanning property and optimality .",
    "we note that a positive map @xmath1 detects entanglement with positive partial transposes if and only if it is indecomposable .",
    "an indecomposable positive map @xmath1 is said to be a non - decomposable optimal entanglement witness ( nd - oew ) in @xcite if it detects a maximal set of pptes .",
    "but , it is not clear at all that an optimal entanglement witness which is non - decomposable is really nd - oew in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we found that this is not the case . in order to avoid such confusion",
    ", we use the following terminology in this note .",
    "a positive linear map @xmath1 is said to    * be _ co - optimal _ if the smallest face of @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has no completely copositive map . *",
    "be _ bi - optimal _ if it is optimal and co - optimal .",
    "* have the _ co - spanning property _ if the smallest exposed face of @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has no completely copositive map .",
    "* have the _ bi - spanning property _ if it has both the spanning and co - spanning property .",
    "it is clear that @xmath1 is co - optimal ( respectively has the co - spanning property ) if and only if the composition @xmath9 with the transpose map @xmath10 is optimal ( respectively has the spanning property ) .",
    "if we use the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism , then a self - adjoint block matrix @xmath11 is co - optimal ( respectively has the co - spanning property ) if and only if the partial transpose @xmath12 is optimal ( respectively has the spanning property ) .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath1 is bi - optimal ( respectively has the bi - spanning property ) if and only if the smallest face ( respectively the smallest exposed face ) of @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has no decomposable map .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is an nd - oew in the sense of @xcite if and only if it is bi - optimal .",
    "we note that if @xmath1 is bi - optimal then it is automatically indecomposable .",
    "we will present examples of indecomposable optimal positive linear maps which are not bi - optimal . since an optimal decomposable entanglement witness is completely copositive , it is never co - optimal . therefore , the notions of co - optimality and co - spanning are useful only for indecomposable entanglement witnesses .    for nonnegative real numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the choi type map is given by    @xmath15(x)=\\\\ \\begin{pmatrix } ax_{11}+bx_{22}+cx_{33 } & -x_{12 } & -x_{13 } \\\\",

    "this is the first known example to distinguish @xmath22-positivities for different @xmath23 .",
    "the map @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath25 is also the first example of an indecomposable positive linear map @xcite in the literature , and the map @xmath26 $ ] is extremal @xcite , that is , generates an extremal ray of the cone @xmath0 .",
    "later , it was shown @xcite that this map @xmath26 $ ] is not the sum of a @xmath21-positive map and a @xmath21-copositive map .",
    "see also ref .",
    "the map @xmath26 $ ] is usually called the choi map .",
    "the maps @xmath27 $ ] have been considered in @xcite to distinguish various notions of positivity .",

    "it is known @xcite that the map @xmath27 $ ] is positive if and only if the condition @xmath28 holds .",

    "before going further , we note that the six properties , optimal , co - optimal , bi - optimal , spanning , co - spanning and bi - spanning are properties depending on the faces : if @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the same smallest face containing them , then they are interior points of a common face , and share the each property , because the properties are described in terms of faces . therefore , we can say that a face itself has one among six properties without confusion , and this means that every interior point of the face satisfies the property .",
    "it is also clear that a face has a property , then every subface also has the same property . hence ,",
    "if a point @xmath1 does not have a property then every interior point in the face containing @xmath1 does not have the property .",
    "therefore , we need to clarify the facial structures of the @xmath34-dimensional convex body itself determined by ( [ pos ] ) . it should be noted that the face of the convex body need not give rise to a real face of the convex cone @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , an interior point of a face of the convex body gives rise to an interior point of the face of the cone @xmath0 determined by the corresponding map .",
    "first of all , the convex body has the following four @xmath21-dimensional faces :    * @xmath35 , * @xmath36 , * @xmath37 , * @xmath38 .",
    "we note @xcite that @xmath27 $ ] is completely positive if and only if @xmath39 , and it is completely copositive if and only if @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the face @xmath41 has the completely positive map @xmath42 $ ] and the completely copositive map @xmath43 $ ] , and so @xmath41 is neither optimal nor co - optimal .",
    "it is also easy to examine the optimality for the first three cases .",
    "for example , if @xmath44 then the map @xmath45 $ ] is written by @xmath46=\\phi[2,0,0]+(a-2)d,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the diagonal map which send @xmath48 $ ] to the diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries @xmath49 . the map @xmath47 is both completely positive and completely copositive .",
    "this means that the map @xmath45 $ ] never satisfy optimality and co - optimality .",
    "therefore , every interior point in the @xmath21-dimensional faces @xmath50 and @xmath51 never satisfy above properties . by the same argument , this is also the case for the face @xmath52 .",
    "we note that the convex body has also the following five @xmath53-dimensional faces which are on the @xmath54-axis , @xmath55-plane or @xmath56-plane :    * @xmath57 , * @xmath58 , * @xmath59 , * @xmath60 , * @xmath61 .    among them",
    ", we have already seen that the face @xmath62 is neither optimal nor co - optimal .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , since it is possible to subtract a map which is both completely positive and completely copositive .",
    "it is also clear that neither @xmath65 nor @xmath66 is optimal . in order to find other @xmath53-dimensional faces",
    ", we note that the parametrization @xmath67 satisfies the condition @xmath68 as was considered in @xcite . for each fixed positive number @xmath69 with @xmath70 , the line segment given by    * @xmath71    lies on the surface @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and connects the point @xmath74 to the point @xmath75 .",
    "this gives us @xmath53-dimensional faces @xmath76 for each @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath77 $ ] is completely copositive for each @xmath69 , and so it is clear that @xmath76 is not co - optimal .",
    "it remains to list up @xmath78-dimensional faces as follows :    * @xmath79 , * @xmath80 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , * @xmath81 for @xmath69 .",
    "is itself , but the smallest exposed face containing it is @xmath65 .",
    "the straight lines containing the faces @xmath82 , and @xmath76 meet each other at the point @xmath83 which is not in the convex body . ]",
    "so far , we have seen that the faces @xmath51 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , @xmath41 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are neither optimal nor co - optimal .",
    "therefore , they have neither the spanning property nor co - spanning property .",
    "we test the other faces .",
    "first of all , we show that @xmath76 and @xmath81 have the spanning properties . to do this",
    ", it suffices to consider the case when @xmath84 satisfies the condition @xmath85    we recall @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath86 has the spanning property if and only if the set @xmath87:=\\{\\xi\\otimes\\eta\\in \\mathbb c^m\\otimes \\mathbb c^n:\\langle \\xi \\otimes \\eta|c_{\\phi}|\\xi \\otimes \\eta\\rangle = 0\\}\\ ] ] spans the whole space @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the choi matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "we define vectors in @xmath90 as follows @xmath91 then , it is easy to check that @xmath92|\\xi_{\\theta,\\sigma}^k\\otimes \\eta_{\\theta,\\sigma}^k\\rangle\\\\ = & -2(1-a)bc^{1/2}+2b^{3/2}c \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , whenever the condition   holds",
    ". therefore , the vectors @xmath95 belong to @xmath96 $ ] for all @xmath93 whenever the condition ( [ cccc ] ) holds .",
    "we take @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and consider the @xmath99 matrix whose columns are nine vectors @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "then the determinant of @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 which is nonzero .",
    "this shows that @xmath76 and @xmath81 have the spanning properties .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath78-dimensional face @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the smallest exposed face @xmath3 containing @xmath105 already contains @xmath104 in the fig.1.(see ref .",
    "@xcite for more general approach ) .",
    "we have seen @xcite that @xmath26 $ ] has the co - spanning property , and so @xmath3 has no completely copositive map .",
    "this show that @xmath104 has the co - spanning property , and so @xmath65 and @xmath66 also have the co - spanning properties .",
    "we summarize the result as follows :    .summary of ( co-)optimality and ( co-)spanning property for faces of the convex body illustrated in fig",
    ". 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we note @xcite that the map @xmath27 $ ] is decomposable if and only if the following condition @xmath106 holds .",
    "therefore , we see that interior points of the following faces @xmath107 give rise to indecomposable positive maps .",
    "we note that every interior point of the face @xmath76 gives rise to an example of an indecomposable optimal entanglement witness which is not bi - optimal .",
    "so , this is not nd - oewin the sense of @xcite .",
    "if we consider the composition by the transpose map then the faces @xmath65 and @xmath66 play the exactly same role .",
    "they also provide us examples of non - extremal entanglement witnesses with the spanning property . on the other hand ,",
    "the choi maps @xmath105 and @xmath108 are extremal entanglement witnesses without the spanning property .",
    "therefore , we see that two sufficient conditions , extremeness and spanning property , for the optimality is logically independent .",
    "in this note , we considered choi type positive maps between @xmath8 matrices , and determined their optimality , co - optimality , spanning property and co - spanning property . we have seen that even though a non - decomposable entanglement witness is optimal , it need not to be a non - decomposable optimal entanglement witness   in the sense of @xcite . because a positive map detects a pptes if and only if it is indecomposable , we suggest to use the term _ pptes witness _ in the place of non - decomposable entanglement witness , and use the term _ optimal pptes witness _ in the place of nd - oew . in other word , we say that a positive map is an optimal pptes witness when it is bi - optimal .",
    "this is very natural since a positive map detects a maximal set of pptes if and only if it is bi - optimal .",
    "optimality is not so easy to determine for a given positive linear map , because we do not know the whole facial structures of the convex cone @xmath0 consisting of all positive maps .",
    "the spanning property is stronger than optimality and relatively easy to check .",
    "another sufficient condition for optimality is extremeness .",
    "we also showed that spanning property and extremeness are logically independent .",
