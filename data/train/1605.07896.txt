    "the notion of equilibrium of a strategic game and the mathematical formulation of rational behaviour in situations of conflict are among the most fruitful ideas in the history of economics , and duly became a cornerstone of any modern discussion on the subject .",
    "the topic was initiated by the classic treatment of von neumann and morgenstern  @xcite , where it was realized that in the realm of mixed strategy there is always a minimax equilibrium for zero - sum games .",
    "another milestone was the definition of _ nash equilibrium _",
    "@xcite and nash s proof that in mixed strategies there always exists one .",
    "these pioneering results were followed by a multitude of further investigations into other concepts of equilibrium and their properties , including the question of how the players , knowing the game , can find one @xcite .",
    "motivated , among other things , by the realization that nash equilibria sometimes can be `` bad '' both individually and collectively for the players , a major direction in game theory is the question of how to induce players , or help them , to a more beneficial equilibrium @xcite .",
    "one important idea is that giving the players _ advice _ , in the form of a random variable , can change the landscape of equilibria .",
    "this generalizes the concept of nash equilibrium to _ correlated equilibria _ @xcite .",
    "the present paper is about advice in the setting of _ games of incomplete information_. as it turns out , this is a subject of considerable complexity , since the kind of correlation that can serve as advice to the players can be far more general than in the case of complete information . in games of incomplete information , or _",
    "bayesian games _ , each player has a _ type _ which is not perfectly known to , but only estimated by , the other players .",
    "depending on what the game models , a type can be many things .",
    "for example , it can represent a characteristic of the player ( strong , weak , rich , poor , etc . ) or a secret objective of the player ( interest in one particular outcome ) .",
    "for this class of games , a relevant solution concept is the _ communication equilibrium _  @xcite . here",
    ", the players privately communicate their type to a mediator , who implements a correlation and gives each player advice for a convenient action .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that players are comfortable with revealing their private information to a trusted mediator if this gives them an advantage .",
    "however , there are situations where it might be crucial for players never to reveal any private information to the other players ( e.g. , trade secrets ) . in game theory , this concept has been noted before when discussing correlations . in @xcite",
    "it is called `` conditional independence property '' or `` belief - invariance '' , while in @xcite it is called `` non - communicating garbling '' and in @xcite is called `` individually uninformativeness '' . in the above cases ,",
    "however , this property is used to make the analysis of the equilibria more convenient , and is not highlighted as interesting in its own right .    from a completely different angle",
    ", belief - invariance has been a topic of research in physics ( motivated by questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite ) and theoretical computer science ( motivated by multi - prover interactive proof systems  @xcite and parallel repetition of games  @xcite ) , under the name of _ non - signalling correlations_. in these investigations , belief - invariance is relevant because it describes the largest class of correlations that obey relativistic causality .    here , we bring together the strands of thought coming from these two backgrounds . on the one hand , this results in a more general and much richer picture of non - locality as a resource and , on the other hand , allows us to import findings from the physics of non - locality and non - signalling to game theory .",
    "the interdisciplinarity leaves us with the problem of choosing the language in which to formulate our results , as we might end up not reaching anyone from either side of the discipline divide .",
    "we have chosen to use a language familiar to game theorists , but hopefully not too far from the one used in physics and computer science .    we define and study the class of _ belief - invariant communication equilibria _ and compare it with the classes of communication equilibria and correlated equilibria .",
    "we discuss , always in the language of game theory , relevant examples from physics @xcite and we introduce new ones .",
    "our examples are applied to the study of the _ social welfare _ of games .",
    "namely , we exhibit a game where belief - invariance is socially better than any correlated equilibrium , and a game where all non - belief - invariant communication equilibria have a suboptimal social welfare .",
    "we then proceed to show that there is a subclass of the belief - invariant correlations that gives rise to the interesting concept of `` fully private correlations '' : correlations that reveal the type of a player neither to the other players nor to the mediator , and still can achieve equilibrium outcomes that would be impossible without an informed mediator . however , to implement this class one needs to rely on quantum mechanical effects . for this reason , in a stand - alone section",
    ", we give a brief introduction to some basic linear algebraic notions behind quantum mechanics and we consider a class of correlations that arises from observing a shared quantum mechanical state .",
    "we will prove that there are games for which the resulting equilibria have better social welfare than the ones that may be achieved without quantum effects .",
    "note that we need games of incomplete information to exhibit this quantum advantage : zhang  @xcite proved that in games of full information , there can be no quantum advantage .",
    "the use of quantum mechanical correlations in game theory has been studied in many forms and flavours , as can be seen from the survey @xcite , the references therein , and the more recent works @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this work is the first to unify communication equilibria , belief invariance , quantum equilibria and correlated equilibria in a general framework .    we organize the paper as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prel ] defines the objects we are working on : first games of incomplete information and then various classes of correlations .",
    "section [ sec : equilibria ] uses these concepts to define the classes of equilibria we study . in section [ sec : examples ] we discuss some meaningful examples where belief - invariance helps reaching a better social outcome . in section  [ sec : app ] , we will discuss some practical applications of our new definitions .",
    "no quantum physics is involved in the sections above ; only in section [ sec : quantum ] we broaden the discussion to include the quantum case , and we will present it in a way that makes it fit into the framework we have developed up to that point .",
    "finally , we will discuss some open problems in the conclusions section .",
    "in this section we define the basic concepts we need to discuss our classes of equilibria .",
    "first we will define games of incomplete information and their strategies .",
    "later , we will define the notion of correlation and the classes of probability distributions we need .",
    "there are several slightly different notations for games of incomplete information .",
    "we will follow the one of forges @xcite because of the closeness with our topic .",
    "we find it convenient to work with games in _ strategic form _ because of the similarity with the approach in quantum information to so - called _ non - local games_. in a game in strategic form , in a single round , all players make their moves simultaneously , and receive their respective payoffs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that games of incomplete information , as presented here , are also called _",
    "bayesian games _ ( because there is a fixed prior distribution on the types ) , and can be analyzed in a probability theory setting .    a _ game with incomplete information _",
    "@xmath0 is defined by the following objects :    * a finite set of _ players _",

    "the behaviour of the players is modelled as follows .",
    "a _ strategy _ @xmath10 for the player @xmath11 is a map from the information that @xmath11 knows to an action @xmath12 . in the absence of any correlation or external advice",
    ", players can apply pure strategies or mixed ones . a _ pure strategy _ for player",
    "@xmath11 is a map @xmath13 , meaning that players select an action based only on their type .",
    "a _ mixed strategy _ for player @xmath11 is a probability distribution over pure ones , i.e. the function @xmath13 becomes a random variable .",
    "if we want to make its distribution explicit , we introduce the independent local random variables @xmath14 with probability @xmath15 .",
    "and we set @xmath16 .",
    "this random function describes a conditional probability distribution on @xmath17 given @xmath18 , denoted by slight abuse of notation as @xmath19 .",
    "the game goes as follows .",
    "the types @xmath20 are sampled according to @xmath21 .",
    "each player @xmath11 learns his type @xmath22 , uses his strategy @xmath10 to select an action @xmath12 , and is awarded according to his payoff function @xmath23 ( which in general depends also on the other players actions and types ) .",
    "hence , the expected utility of player @xmath11 is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . observe that if @xmath21 is a point mass on a fixed type @xmath27 , @xmath28 , we recover the usual games of complete information .",
    "a game is called _ full coordination game _ if all the payoff functions are equal , i.e. , all players are interested in the same outcome . on the other hand ,",
    "if the payoff functions are distinct , we talk about a _ game of conflicting interests_.    a _ solution _ for a game is a family of strategies @xmath25 , one for each player .",
    "players are modelled as being _ selfish _ and _ rational _ , meaning that fixing the other players strategies , each player chooses the strategy that maximizes his own expected payoff , by using the resources he has access to . a solution is then said to be an _ equilibrium _ ( more precisely a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ ) if no player has an incentive to change the adopted strategy . in the basic , uncorrelated , case",
    ", this means that @xmath29 for all @xmath11 and @xmath30 .",
    "this can be expressed more concisely as saying that for all @xmath11 , @xmath22 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and , by independence of @xmath14 , @xmath34 .",
    "note also that a game of incomplete information can be modelled as a game of complete information where the players strategies are @xmath35 , i.e. , all possible functions from @xmath18 to @xmath17 .",
    "then , by nash s theorem  @xcite , every game of incomplete information has an equilibrium .",

    "a simple pure strategy for each player in the chsh game is the constant function mapping to @xmath52 .",

    "each company is trying to introduce a new product , and the features of the products are trade secrets .",
    "they have an incentive to cooperate in order to minimize the production costs but , at the same time , they have an incentive _ not _ to cooperate , as the negotiation might expose their secrets . in such a setting , if there were a trusted third party able to implement a correlated or a belief - invariant equilibrium , this would not longer be an issue .    note that this simple example can be generalized to every setting in which players payoff are affected by the ability of `` guessing the other players types '' .    [ [ advertising . ] ] advertising .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    a typical setting in which the ability of guessing the other players type is of huge importance is advertising ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a setting an advertiser has a product to advertise , whose absolute quality is unknown to the potential users . the advertiser can adopt different advertising strategies ( e.g. , viral advertising , commercials , newspaper ads , web ads ) , whose success depends on the features of the subject to which the advertisement is aimed . on the other side , users would like to receive ads only for high - quality products , therefore they do not like to reveal their interests .",
    "hence , as above , it would be useful both for advertiser and for users to correlate their actions , so that the advertisers would be able to make more successful advertising campaign and the users could receive more ads for high - quality products than for low - quality ones .",
    "however , because of the privacy issues discussed above , this correlation may be effectively implemented only if there is a trusted mediator that is able to find a good correlated or belief - invariant equilibrium .",

    "the mediator , then , announces the partition trying to create an equilibrium that maximizes player s happiness with the choice .",

    "the expected values of the product of the outcomes are : @xmath457 we do the following relabelling of the actions : @xmath458 and @xmath459 , and we get ( by labelling the actions in the subscript ) : @xmath460 on substituting ( [ exp ] ) in ( [ mermin ] ) , using normalization condition for probabilities , and rearranging , we get , @xmath461 on simplifying we get : @xmath462 where , @xmath463 let @xmath464 , then @xmath465 .",
    "the bound we see on quantity @xmath466 is derived by considering all possible local correlations , therefore , nonlocal ( quantum , no - signalling , or signalling ) correlations can violate these bounds .",
    "however , @xmath466 also has algebraic bounds , @xmath467 , which is respected by any type of correlation ( or probability distribution ) .",
    "the algebraic restriction on @xmath466 implies that @xmath468 for any type of correlation .",
    "one important feature of mermin inequality is that its algebraic bounds can be achieved by quantum correlations .",
    "we will use this feature of the mermin inequality to discover interesting properties in the game that we are considering here .    for the game of figure [ tab : ghz_2 ] ,",
    "the sum of expected payoffs of the three players turns out to be : @xmath469 for any local strategy ( correlated or uncorrelated ) @xmath470 for any possible strategies ( quantum , belief - invariant or communicating ) : @xmath471    if the game is played with the same correlation ( which we implemented as a quantum strategy in section [ sec : quantumghz ] ) , the expected payoff @xmath472 moreover , the strategy is a quantum equilibrium ( the proof is very similar to the one of proposition [ prop : quantum_equilibrium_ghz ] ; only the objective function changes which is again easy to maximize ) .",
    "therefore , an interesting feature of the game of figure [ tab : ghz_2 ] is that with the considered quantum protocol we obtain the optimal fair equilibrium , _",
    "i.e , _ no other quantum equilibrium , belief - invariant equilibrium , or even communication equilibrium can do better than this protocol in our second ghz game .",
    "this is a new feature which was not revealed in the two party modified chsh - game considered in @xcite where optimal fair quantum correlated equilibrium was found , however , for the modified chsh - game belief - invariant equilibrium , and communication equilibrium can do better than the optimal quantum fair equilibrium .",
    "we have formally introduced the class of belief - invariant communication equilibria and its quantum mechanical version .",
    "even if such classes appeared implicitly in previous work , a systematic study and an hunt for useful applications was not performed before . with this work",
    "we would like to open the way for collaboration between the quantum information and the game theory community , to address the numerous open problems .",

    "_ complete the complexity scenario .",
    "_ in section [ sec : properties ] we discuss some computational complexity facts . for example , verifying that a solution is an equilibrium is easy if the number of actions is bounded , while finding the optimal ( quantum ) correlated equilibrium is a hard task , given the connection with multi - prover interactive proofs . however , how difficult is to sample a quantum or a belief - invariant equilibrium ? are there classes of games where this is easy , like the succinct games of @xcite ?",
    "2 .   _ get large separations and upper bound the largest possible separation .",
    "_ full coordination games are used to design bell tests , experiments that quantify how different quantum mechanics is from classical physics . for this fundamental task ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the separation between the largest expected payoff at a quantum and at a correlated equilibrium .",
    "the race for large separations was settled in @xcite , where the authors exhibited a game that almost matches the upper bound proven in @xcite . in our context here",
    ", large separations would translate to economical or social convenience of implementing communication equilibria while respecting the privacy of the player .",
    "are there conflict - of - interest games where the quantum correlated equilibrium leads to a much better social optimum than the correlated one ?",
    "is there an upper bound like the one of @xcite ?",
    "3 .   _ can any non - local game be converted in a conflict - of - interest game ? _",
    "this is a question from @xcite .",
    "the non - local games are the above - mentioned coordination games used in physics",
