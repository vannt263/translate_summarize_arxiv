    "according to the standard pulsar model , in particular , the so - called polar cap model @xcite , particles uproot from the star s surface , and accelerate along the magnetic field lines @xcite inside a gap zone .",
    "in general , it is believed that these particles produce the nonthermal radiation , which is interpreted in terms of the synchrotron mechanism @xcite and the inverse compton scattering @xcite respectively .",
    "generally speaking , due to strong synchrotron losses , relativistic electrons quickly lose their perpendicular momentum , and transit to their ground landau states .",
    "therefore , particles may be approximately described as moving one - dimensionally along the field lines , which in turn means that the synchrotron mechanism does not contribute in high energy radiation processes . on the other hand , under certain conditions , due to the quasi - linear diffusion ( qld )",
    ", the pitch angles might be recreated , leading to the efficient synchrotron emission .",
    "this method has already been applied to pulsars @xcite and active galactic nuclei @xcite .    in the context of qld",
    ", the recent detection of the vhe radiation from the crab pulsar @xcite could be very important .",
    "magic cherenkov telescope from 2007 october to 2008 february , has discovered the pulsed emission above 25gev , which reveals several characteristic features .",
    "a special interest deserves the coincidence of signals from different energy bands ranging from radio to vhe ( @xmath0gev ) domain @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that according to the data , the polar cap models must be excluded from the possible scenario of the radiation , which must happen far out in the magnetosphere .",
    "analysis of the magic data also implies that a location of the aforementioned vhe and low energy emissions must be the same . by taking into account the synchrotron reaction force",
    ", we constructed the kinetic equation governing the qld and the results of the magic data have been interpreted ( machabeli & osmanov 2009 ) .",
    "we argued that the observed vhe radiation is produced by the synchrotron mechanism , having properties , which are in a good agreement with the observations .",
    "the following work ( machabeli & osmanov 2010 ) was related to the problem of the curvature radiation and the inverse compton scattering in the context of the same observations .",
    "we have shown that these mechanisms do not contribute to the vhe domain detected by magic .",
    "in general , magnetic field in pulsar magnetospheres is huge and ranges from @xmath1 g ( far out in the magnetosphere ) to @xmath2 g close to the neutron star s surface .",
    "therefore , magnetospheric plasma is in the frozen - in condition and is forced to follow the magnetic field lines .",
    "this means that effects of corotation in plasma acceleration and emission processes could be very important . in general",
    ", it is believed that the high energy radiation comes from an area located relatively close to the lc surface , where corotation is extremely significant . for this purpose",
    "it is reasonable to consider the quasi - linear diffusion by taking relativistic effects of rotation into account and see how the corotation influences the mentioned processes .    in the present paper",
    "we study the role of the corotation in the quasi - linear diffusion and we show that in the very vicinity of the lc surface , contrary to the quasi - linear diffusion , effects of corotation attempt to decrease the pitch angles , and kill the subsequent synchrotron emission .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the quasi - linear diffusion by taking the effect of corotation into account , in sect .",
    "3 we present our results and in sect .",
    "4 we summarize them .",
    "in this section we present the model , generalizing our previous approach by taking the fact of corotation in to account and see how the efficiency of qld depends on it .    generally speaking ,",
    "the pulsar magnetospheres are composed of low and high energy particles respectively . therefore , in the framework of the paper for simplicity we assume that the magnetosphere is consist of two components : ( a ) the plasma component with the lorentz factor , @xmath3 and ( b ) the beam component with the lorentz factor , @xmath4 .    according to the mechanism of the quasi - linear diffusion the following transverse mode generates @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the modulus of the wave vector , @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the plasma frequency , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are electron s charge and the rest mass , respectively , @xmath11 is the plasma density , @xmath12 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath13 is the magnetic induction .",
    "it can be shown that the aforementioned waves excite if the cyclotron resonance condition is satisfied @xcite @xmath14 by @xmath15 and @xmath16 we denote the wave vector s longitudinal ( parallel to the background magnetic field ) and transverse ( perpendicular to the background magnetic field ) components respectively , @xmath17 is the drift velocity of electrons , @xmath18 is the component of velocity along the magnetic field lines and @xmath19 is field line s curvature radius . in this paper",
    "we consider the beam particles as to be the resonance particles .",
    "one can show from eqs .",
    "( [ disp1],[cycl ] ) that the excited cyclotron wave is characterized by the following frequency @xcite @xmath20 generally speaking , particles moving in the magnetic field , experience two forces , one of which , @xmath21 , having the following components @xcite @xmath22 is responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic invariant , @xmath23 and the second one is the synchrotron radiative force @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "but one can show that for the crab - like pulsars the radiation reaction force , @xmath26 , exceeds @xmath27 by many orders of magnitude ( machabeli & osmanov 2009,2010 ) .",
    "on the other hand , apart from the synchrotron radiative force , relativistic electrons also experience a reaction force responsible for the corotation .",
    "this force can be estimated by a simple mechanical analogy introduced by machabeli & rogava ( 1994 ) and reconsidered by @xcite . in the framework of this approach , instead of magnetic field lines and particles sliding along them ,",
    "one considers a corotating pipe with a bead inside it .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic field lines are straight , then the reaction force acting on a single particle from the beam component can be given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angular velocity of rotation , @xmath30 is the radial coordinate , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are momentum s longitudinal and transversal components respectively .    considering a single particle approach , one can show that the lorentz factor of a particle moving along the corotating straight magnetic field yields the equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are particle s initial position and the initial radial velocity respectively and @xmath37 is the light cylinder radius . from eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) we see that the closer to the lc , the bigger the lorentz factor .",
    "therefore a dynamical effect of the corotation becomes extremely efficient nearby this area [ see eq .",
    "( [ reac ] ) ] where the reaction force can be approximated as to be [ see eq .",
    "( [ r4 ] ) in appendix ] @xmath38    as we have mentioned , in the crab pulsar magnetosphere one may neglect the effects of @xmath21 in comparison with @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the process of the quasi - linear diffusion is mainly influenced by the synchrotron radiative force , @xmath39 and the reaction force , @xmath40 . the synchrotron radiation reaction force , acting on a particle , attempts to decelerate it , therefore relativistic electrons loose their perpendicular momentum , leading to an inevitable decrease of the pitch angles . in spite of the fact that contrary to @xmath39 , the reaction force plays an accelerative role in electron s dynamics , in the context of the pitch angles",
    "its role is the same .",
    "in particular , as we have already discussed , the mentioned reaction force is a direct consequence of corotation .",
    "this means that @xmath40 is constructed in such a way that particles always must stay on the magnetic field lines , therefore , the reaction force also attempts to decrease the pitch angles . on the other hand , the quasi - linear diffusion , that arises through the influence of the waves back on the particles , via the qld attempts to widen a range of the pitch angles .",
    "the dynamical process saturates when the effects of the above mentioned forces are balanced by the diffusion .",
    "for @xmath41 it is easy to show that in the quasi - stationary case ( @xmath42 ) , the corresponding kinetic equation governing the qld writes as follows @xcite @xmath43}{\\partial\\psi } = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\psi}\\left[\\psi d_{\\perp\\perp}\\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial\\psi}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the distribution function of particles with respect to the pitch angles , @xmath45 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath46 is the density of the beam component and @xmath47 is the pulsar s rotation period . the solution of eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) writes as follows @xmath48 as is clear from this expression , electrons are differently distributed for different pitch angles .",
    "let us note that the reaction force and the synchrotron radiative force have opposite directions , since @xmath49 is responsible for deceleration of electrons , whereas @xmath50 accelerates them .",
    "it is clear that close to the lc , a value of @xmath51 is very high and for very small pitch angles exceeds @xmath52 and therefore , higher values of pitch angles lead to higher values of the distribution function . but by increasing @xmath53 the corresponding reaction force does not change [ see eq .",
    "( [ reac1 ] ) ] , whereas the synchrotron radiative force is very sensitive to this change , @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , at a certain pitch angle , @xmath55 , these forces will balance each other and the distribution function will reach its maximum value . in particular , one can straightforwardly show that the expression of the distribution function [ see eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) ] peaks at @xmath56{4a_2 } } = \\left(\\frac{2mc\\omega}{\\alpha\\gamma_{b0}^2\\gamma_b^{1/2}}\\right)^{1/3},\\ ] ] which indeed corresponds to @xmath57 . here",
    ", we have taken into account the following relation @xmath58 [ @xmath59 , see eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) ] .",
    "it is reasonable to estimate how steep is the distribution function . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case @xmath60 , then examining the crab pulsar s ( @xmath61s ) magnetospheric parameters close to the lc surface : @xmath62 g , @xmath63 , one can see that at the peak , @xmath64rad , the distribution function exceeds its value at @xmath65 by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this means that most of the particles will be characterized by the peak value of the pitch angle , and therefore , its average value can be estimated as to be @xmath55 .",
    "we have taken into account that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 cm is the pulsar s radius , @xmath68 g is the magnetic induction on the star s surface and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 for the crab pulsar , see @xcite ) .",
    "since we consider centrifugally accelerated particles , our approach is based on the assumption that electrons corotate with the spinning pulsar , which is valid only inside a certain zone ( corotation zone with a radius @xmath71 ) , because in this region the magnetic field is strong enough to channel the flow .",
    "this means that , our approach is valid if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear that corotation takes place if the magnetic energy density exceeds the beam energy density , therefore , @xmath71 can be can be estimated by the condition : @xmath73 .",
    "if we consider a range of @xmath74 , then by taking eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) into account , one can see that for @xmath75 one has @xmath76 , which means that corotation is violated in a very close region to the lc surface and for almost the whole course of motion the spinning magnetic field channels the electrons .",
    "when relativistic particles move in the magnetic field , they emit electromagnetic waves , which in our case correspond to the following photon energies @xcite : @xmath77 @xmath78",
    "in this section we are going to apply the method to the crab - like pulsars and see what changes in the process of the qld when corotation is taken into account .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the dependence of photon energies on the lorentz factors of the beam electrons for three different initial values of the beam lorentz factors .",
    "the set of parameters is @xmath61s , @xmath62 g , @xmath79}. as is clear from the plots by increasing @xmath4 the corresponding emission energy increases as well .",
    "this is a natural result , because more energetic electrons emit more energetic photons [ see eq . ( [ eps ] ) ] . a second feature concerns the behaviour of @xmath80 versus @xmath81 .",
    "it is evident that the higher the initial beam lorentz factor the lower the emission energy .",
    "indeed , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ pitch ] ) the pitch angle behaves as @xmath82 , therefore , for higher initial beam lorentz factors one obtains lower values of the pitch angles and hence , the corresponding synchrotron energy becomes lower .",
    "the relativistic effects of rotation could also be interesting in the context of the recently detected vhe pulsed emission ( @xmath0gev ) from the crab pulsar . according to the interpretation presented in ( machabeli & osmanov 2009,2010 )",
    ", the mentioned radiation is formed on lengthscales of the order of @xmath83 cm via the quasi - linear diffusion . as it has been shown , in order to explain the data , the value of the beam lorentz factor must be of the order of @xmath84 .",
    "for centrifugally accelerated electrons the effects of corotation become significant in the nearby zone of the lc surface . in particular , from eq .",
    "( [ reac1 ] ) it is clear that the reaction force is proportional to @xmath85 , which in turn asymptotically increases by reaching the lc surface [ see eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) ] .",
    "the corresponding lengthscale of a layer on the light cylinder zone , where the effects are intensified by corotation , can be estimated as follows @xmath86 where we have taken into account eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) .",
    "as we see from this expression , the layer is quite thin , @xmath87 .",
    "unlike the papers by machabeli & osmanov ( 2009,2010 ) where the effects of corotation are not significant , and the vhe radiation ( @xmath0gev ) can be achieved by the relativistic particles with @xmath88 , a part of the magnetosphere located very close to the lc surface , may guarantee the aforementioned emission energy for lower lorentz factors . in particular , from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it is clear that the synchrotron process supported by the qld produces @xmath89gev photons for @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , which are much lower than @xmath96 .",
    "the quasi - linear diffusion is so efficient that under certain conditions it can provide tev photons as well .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the relativistic electrons with lorentz factors @xmath97 ( @xmath60 ) may provide tev emission ( @xmath98tev ) .    according to the present method , the process of the qld depends on excitation of the unstable cyclotron waves , which correlate with the high energy radiation . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the behaviour of synchrotron emission energy versus the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the set of parameters is the same as in fig .",
    "as is seen from the plots , the vhe radiation is strongly connected with relatively low energy radiation starting from microwave ( @xmath99hz ) to optical ( @xmath100hz ) domains respectively .",
    "the investigation shows that very close to the lc area , where effects of corotation are extremely important , the quasi - linear diffusion becomes so efficient that under favorable conditions it may provide vhe radiation for relatively lower energy electrons than in the regime considered by machabeli & osmanov ( 2009,2010 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to demonstrate for crab - like pulsars that the relativistic effects of rotation are of fundamental importance for studying the vhe emission via qld .",
    "studying rotationally driven quasi - linear diffusion for @xmath101-sec pulsars also is an interesting problem , but it is out of the scope of the present paper and sooner or later we are going to consider it as well .",
    "1 .   we have examined the vhe radiation of crab - like pulsars via the quasi - linear diffusion intensified by the effects of corotation which takes place in the nearby zone of the lc surface .",
    "it has been emphasized that due to very strong magnetic field of pulsar magnetospheres the efficient energy losses lead to the damping of the synchrotron process .",
    "close to the lc surface the effects of corotation become significant and apart from the synchrotron radiative force , which decreases the pitch angles , also the reaction force ( responsible for corotation ) has to be taken into account . generalizing the kinetic equation governing the qld ,",
    "we have found the particle distribution with respect to @xmath53 and estimated its average value .",
    "3 .   considering crab - like pulsar s magnetospheric parameters we have found that the quasi - linear diffusion becomes more efficient on the lc zone , than for locations far from this area .",
    "it has been shown that the synchrotron emission process , via the qld , might provide vhe emission even in the tev domain .",
    "we have found that the vhe radiation is strongly connected with the cyclotron emission having relatively low frequencies .",
    "the research was supported by the georgian national science foundation grant gnsf / st07/4 - 193 .        from eqs .",
    "( [ reac]-[pfi ] ) one can see that @xmath102 by applying eq .",
