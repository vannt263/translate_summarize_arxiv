    "the azimuthal flow of particles produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions has provided a strong evidence for the creation of a hot and dense system very early in non - central collisions  @xcite .",
    "the importance of this observation stems from the fact that pressure gradients generated in the system at very early times , transform the eccentricity in co - ordinate space for such collisions to the momentum space for distribution of the produced particles  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath3 at lower transverse momenta has been quantitatively explained using hydrodynamics  @xcite , the observed saturation of @xmath3 at higher @xmath10 has been attributed to effects of viscosity  @xcite or incomplete thermalization  @xcite .",
    "the observed scaling of @xmath3 with the number of valence quarks in the hadrons is understood in terms of the recombination model for hadronization  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the study of the elliptic flow of thermal photons  @xcite may provide valuable insight into the build - up of azimuthal flow with time .",
    "this will require a subtraction of the contribution of photons from the decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons produced in the collisions  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of elliptic flow of inclusive photons from that of decay photons , will thus confirm the presence of additional sources of photons .",
    "we shall see later that the elliptic flow of photons from the decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons may also provide useful estimates for @xmath3 of the partons in the frame - work of the recombination model .    in the present work ,",
    "we suggest an ansatz for the evaluation of the elliptic flow of photons from the decay of pions , which could be useful for such studies . in the next section we study the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow parameter for decay photons for several momentum distribution functions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . in section iii ; we evaluate the @xmath3 for photons arising from 2-@xmath7 decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , which are formed from recombination of partons to get a direct relation with @xmath3 for partons .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions .",
    "consider a @xmath0 having four - momentum @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 decaying into two photons .",
    "the momentum distribution of photons in an invariant form is given by  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the four - momentum of the photon .",
    "thus , the lorentz invariant cross - section for photon production is    @xmath15    let us write the pion distribution as :    @xmath16 \\label{azi}\\ ] ]    for a non - central collision of identical nuclei , where @xmath17 is the momentum dependent elliptic flow parameter .",
    "we consider two typical parameterizations for the pion distribution : an exponential distribution and a power - law distribution .",
    "for the first case , we assume @xmath18 where the slope parameter @xmath19 is of the order of 290 mev  @xcite and the width parameter of the rapidity distribution @xmath20 is taken as @xmath21  4 . for the power - law distribution , we take  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 5 gev and @xmath24 is about 29 . the elliptic flow parameter @xmath3 is approximated as @xmath25 \\label{v2}\\ ] ] which approximately reflects the increase of @xmath3 with @xmath10 for lower transverse momenta and saturation of its value at larger @xmath10 .",
    "we have taken @xmath26 0.2 and @xmath27 1  gev for the first set of calculations .",
    "all the results given in the present work are for photon rapidity equal to zero .    0.2 in    eq .",
    "[ dsig ] is then evaluated numerically and @xmath28 for the resulting photon distribution obtained . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we give our results for the spectrum of photons from decay of @xmath0 along with the variation of transverse momentum dependence of their elliptic flow parameter .",
    "we find that for both distributions , the resulting @xmath28 for the decay photons can be approximated as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 0.1  0.2 gev , for @xmath32 0.2 gev , to an accuracy of better than 1 3 % .",
    "0.2 in    this result can be understood as follows .",
    "the @xmath33-function in eq .",
    "[ dec ] provides that @xmath34 in an obvious notation .",
    "next , we note that once the momentum of the pions is large , the opening angle for the decay - photons will be very small  @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , in the extreme case , we have , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the photons which are co - linear with the pion .",
    "this leads to the solutions : @xmath37 and @xmath38 for large @xmath10 .",
    "however , in general , the two photons between them will cover the entire range of the allowed transverse momentum .",
    "both the photons , which will be almost co - linear with the pion , will  inherit \" the @xmath3 of the pion , which has a larger transverse momentum .",
    "the photon with the lower @xmath2 will , however , be submerged in a much larger yield of photons coming from decay of @xmath0 having lower @xmath10 , as the transverse momentum distribution of pions falls steeply with increase in @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in general the @xmath3 of a photon with a given transverse momentum will be larger than the @xmath3 of a pion with the same transverse momentum .",
    "this accounts for the shift , eq .  [ del ] .",
    "this argument will hold even if the @xmath17 for the pions decreases with increase in @xmath10 , which is likely for larger @xmath10 .",
    "the only difference would be that @xmath3 for the decay photons will now be smaller than the @xmath3 for the pions at the same transverse momentum ( see later ; fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the spectra and the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow parameter for the @xmath1 mesons are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the rich structure seen for the @xmath1 mesons at smaller transverse momenta has its origin in the large mass of the @xmath1 mesons .",
    "thus , we find that the @xmath3 for decay photons coming from the 2-@xmath7 decay of @xmath1 mesons , approaches the @xmath3 for the mesons only at larger transverse momenta ( @xmath39 0.8  1.0 gev ) . for the simple parameterizations of the momenta considered here ,",
    "@xmath3 is negative for very low @xmath2 as the decay photons are distributed away from the major axis in the momentum space when the @xmath10 of the @xmath1- mesons is low and the opening angles are large .",
    "of - course , a more complete analysis would include the photons coming from the 3-@xmath0 decay of the @xmath1 mesons , which will mainly populate the low @xmath2 window .",
    "while a simulation of the contribution of this process to the @xmath3 can be straight - forward using standard event generators , a direct evaluation will not be easy as it would involve a 10-dimensional numerical integration .",
    "however , we can easily make an estimate of the range of the transverse momenta of photons , where the photons arising from decay @xmath40 would contribute .",
    "the maximum kinetic energy of a @xmath0 in the rest frame of the @xmath1 meson is given by  @xcite : @xmath41    thus , for example , the maximum energy of a pion emerging from an @xmath1 meson having a momentum of 2 gev would be of the order of 0.62 gev and would contribute to photons having momenta less than that .",
    "next , we recall that @xmath42 is of the order of 0.44 for @xmath43 2 gev and is expected to drop to zero at @xmath44 , at least according to calculations based on pythia  @xcite . this coupled with the branching ratio of about 0.3 for this mode of decay should ensure that the contribution of photons from the 3-@xmath0 decay of @xmath1 mesons would be limited to smaller momenta .",
    "a more detailed study of this effect would definitely be useful .",
    "let us return to the discussion of the @xmath3 of photons from the @xmath45 - decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we now plot the ratio of the elliptic flow parameters of the calculated decay photons and the mesons as a function of their transverse momenta in fig .",
    "we see once again that @xmath3 for the two are quite similar when transverse momenta exceeds 1 gev . similar results for the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath46 had earlier been noted by the wa98 group  @xcite .",
    "we now understand this in terms of the momentum shift @xmath33 ( eq .  [ del ] ) .",
    "considering the likely usefulness of the relation given by eq .",
    "[ del ] we have examined it to determine the dependence of @xmath33 on the slope - parameter @xmath19 or the power - law parameter @xmath24 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we see that , in general , the shift @xmath33 is smaller if the distribution is steeper .",
    "this may be considered as a generalization of the sternheimer s",
    "@xcite prescription for azimuthally asymmetric distribution of pions and their decay photons .",
    "we now take a more general shape of the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath3 for pions , which rises with @xmath10 , reaches a maximum , and then starts decreasing .",
    "we illustrate our discussion ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) by taking , @xmath47 we again see that the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath3 for the decay photons is obtained from the @xmath3 for the pions by a shift of about 0.27 gev .    it has been recently reported  @xcite that the so - called quark - number scaling of the elliptic flow parameter suggested by the recombination model works much more accurately when plotted in terms of  transverse kinetic energy \" or @xmath48 , where @xmath12 is the mass of the hadron . in order to see the consequences of this behaviour of the elliptic flow parameter",
    ", we now replace @xmath10 with @xmath48 in eq .",
    "next , taking the exponential distribution function ( eq .  [ exp ] ) for transverse momenta , we calculate the elliptic flow parameter for decay photons from @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .    identifying @xmath2 of the photons with the",
    "so - called  transverse kinetic energy \" , we again see that @xmath3 for photons is simply related to @xmath3 for the pions by a small shift of @xmath49 0.1 gev in the transverse kinetic energy of @xmath0 . we also find that we can easily describe the @xmath3 of the photons from the decay of @xmath1 mesons by a small negative shift .",
    "thus , we see that the elliptic flow parameter of decay photons from @xmath0 which make an overwhelming contribution to the inclusive photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions is simply related ( eq.[del ] ) to the elliptic flow parameter for @xmath0 .",
    "as we can get independent information about the later in terms of the flow of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , these results could be useful in identifying additional sources of photons  @xcite .",
    "as remarked earlier , one of the more interesting results of elliptic flow studies has been the approximate quark - number scaling of the hadronic @xmath3 .",
    "this finds a natural explanation in terms of the recombination model for hadronization of the quark gluon plasma  @xcite , which suggests that in the region of @xmath10 where the recombination of the partons dominates the process of hadronization , that is @xmath50 4 ( 6 ) gev for mesons ( baryons ) and the effect of mass is minimal , @xmath3 obeys a simple scaling law : @xmath51 where @xmath24 is the number of valence quarks in the hadron and @xmath52 is the elliptic flow parameter for them .",
    "the shifted - scaling of the @xmath3 of the decay photons with the @xmath3 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 seen earlier for a variety of momentum distributions and momentum - dependences of @xmath3 , taken along with the valence - quark scaling of the @xmath3 for hadrons , holds out the promise of the  lowly \" decay photons providing a direct measure of the @xmath52 of the partons . in order to examine this possibility",
    ", we now explicitly calculate the @xmath3 for photons from the decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which in turn , are formed by the recombination of partons .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of mesons formed by the recombination from thermal parton distribution can be written as  @xcite : @xmath53   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times   m_t i_0\\left[\\frac{p_t\\sinh \\eta_t}{t}\\right]~. \\label{rainer}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath54 is the transverse mass of the hadron , @xmath55260 mev is the quark mass , @xmath56 175 mev is the transition temperature , and @xmath57 is the transverse rapidity such that @xmath58 , appropriate for a system created in collision of gold nuclei at @xmath59 = 200 gev .",
    "while writing the above we have utilized the @xmath33-function for the asymptotic form of the perturbative meson distribution amplitude .",
    "we now return to the present calculation . in these illustrative studies",
    ", we account for the elliptic flow of the mesons by multiplying the above distribution with @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "we have calculated @xmath61 , the elliptic flow for the partons , using eq .",
    "81 of fries _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we give our results for the elliptic flow parameter for pions obtained , using the recombination model along with the @xmath3 for the photons coming from the decay .",
    "we should not take the results for the @xmath3 for pions for lower @xmath10 too literally , as the pion mass is much smaller than @xmath62 which goes into making it .",
    "however , for larger @xmath10 this difference is not very relevant and we can trust the model .",
    "we see that @xmath63 closely follows the @xmath64 as before .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 mesons on the other hands is large enough to be free from this complication .",
    "we see that once again , the decay photons closely follow the azimuthal asymmetry of the @xmath1 mesons at larger @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we have studied the azimuthal asymmetry of distribution of photons originating from the 2-@xmath7 decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions . several distribution functions and parameterizations of the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow parameter , including those coming from the recombination model",
    "have been considered .",
    "we have empirically found that the elliptic flow parameter for the photons from the decay of pions is quite close to the same for the pions evaluated at a transverse momentum shifted by about 0.1  0.2 gev .",
    "this has its origin in the small opening angle for the photons for pions having large momenta .",
    "similar results are found for photons from the 2-@xmath7 decay of @xmath1 mesons , at @xmath43 1 gev .",
    "these empirical findings could be useful in identifying additional sources of photons , as the elliptical flow of @xmath0 should be similar to that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the flow of @xmath1 mesons could perhaps be approximated with those for kaons based on considerations of their masses and the number of valence quarks . in any case , in general",
    ", the yield of eta mesons is much less compared to that for pions .",
    "thus the presence of an additional source of photons will be indicated by the deviation of the @xmath3 for inclusive photons from the @xmath3 of decay photons from the 2-@xmath7 decay of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , which could be obtained using the @xmath3 for charged pions and kaons .",
    "we add that a relation  @xcite between the @xmath10 integrated anisotropy for @xmath0 and photons from its decay , obtained using simulations , has been successfully used to analyze the azimuthal anisotropy of decay photons in the wa98 experiment  @xcite .",
