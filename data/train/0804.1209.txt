    "as experimental facilities supply fruitful data on nuclei far off the @xmath2-stability , it has been recognized that theoretical approaches to nuclear structure should be renewed in some respects .",
    "one of the key ingredients is wave - function asymptotics at large @xmath0 , which sometimes produces neutron ( proton ) halos in vicinity of the neutron ( proton ) drip line .",
    "it is also important to reinvestigate effective interactions , in connection to the magic numbers that are different from those near the @xmath2-stability line .",
    "we developed a method for the spherical mean - field calculations  @xcite in which the gaussian expansion method ( gem )  @xcite was applied .",
    "this method seems suitable to studying the shell structure from stable to drip - line nuclei , owing to its several advantages .",
    "a large number of nuclei have quadrupole deformation .",
    "the deformation plays a significant role in unstable nuclei as well .",
    "for instance , the deformation can be relevant to the disappearance of the @xmath3 magic number on the so - called ` island of inversion '  @xcite , whereas there remain arguments for individual nuclei ; _",
    "e.g. _ spherical description has also been proposed for @xmath4 mg  @xcite .",
    "it is desired to implement calculations with deformation , reproducing the wave - function asymptotics and handling a wide variety of effective interactions simultaneously .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method for deformed mean - field calculations by applying the gem .",
    "taking advantage of the flexibility in describing the radial degrees of freedom , we adopt a set of the spherical gem bases to represent deformed single - particle ( s.p . ) wave functions , with truncation for the orbital angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the new method is tested in the hartree - fock ( hf ) and the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) calculations for mg nuclei with the gogny interaction , and the results are compared with those in literatures . from the present calculation , an interesting feature is suggested for the drip - line nucleus @xmath1 mg .",
    "in this paper we assume the nuclear mean fields to be axially symmetric and to conserve the parity .",
    "the @xmath6 axis is taken to be the symmetry axis .",
    "the method can immediately be extended to general cases with no symmetry assumptions on the one - body fields , apart from an additional constraint on the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "wave functions can be expressed efficiently  @xcite .",
    "formulae for calculating the one- and two - body matrix elements that are required in the hf and the hfb calculations , as well as the constant @xmath13 , are given in refs .",
    "wave functions under the axially deformed mean field are represented as @xmath14 where the subscript @xmath15 on the lhs stands for the parity .",
    "the sum of @xmath5 and @xmath16 on the rhs runs over all possible values satisfying @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in principle .    in the gem",
    "we usually take @xmath10 s belonging to a geometric progression . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that a certain combination of the real- and complex - range gaussian bases is suitable for nuclear mean - field calculations .",
    "in all the following calculations , we take the basis - set of @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , irrespective of @xmath23 .",
    "namely , 12 bases are employed for each @xmath23 ; 6 bases have real @xmath10 and the other 6 have complex @xmath10 .",
    "this set is quite similar to set  c in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an appropriate set of the gem bases is capable of describing wave functions with various size .",
    "this feature is desirable for self - consistent mean - field calculations with deformation , because in deformed nuclei the density distribution depends on the direction , and degree of the deformation is not known in advance .",
    "we here show adaptability of the gem with respect to size of nuclei , by presenting results of the spherical hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations .",
    "size of spherical nuclei , which is typically represented by the rms radii , depends on the mass number @xmath24 , apart from exotic structure such as neutron halos near the drip line .",
    "many mean - field calculations have been implemented by using the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) bases , particularly when the effective interaction has finite ranges . in the mean - field calculations with the ho bases ,",
    "the length parameter of the bases @xmath25 depends on @xmath24 . for stable nuclei , @xmath26 is almost proportional to @xmath27 , as @xmath28 , although @xmath26 is often adjusted for individual nuclides so as to minimize their energy @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , since the gem basis - set contains gaussians of various ranges , even a single set can describe many nuclei to good precision .",
    "binding energies and rms matter radii calculated with the gogny d1s interaction  @xcite are tabulated in table  [ tab : sph - hf ] , for the doubly - magic nuclei @xmath30o , @xmath31o , @xmath1ca , @xmath32ca , @xmath33zr and @xmath34pb .",

    "the @xmath24-independent set of the gem bases gives no worse , even slightly better results than the @xmath24-dependent ho basis - set except for @xmath30o . to show further the adaptability of the gem basis - set to nuclear size",

    "this suggests that the spatial extention is more important than the mixing of the @xmath47 components particularly in @xmath44 mg .",
    "notice that the ho basis - set in ref .",
    "@xcite contains up to @xmath48 .",
    "as we have pointed out , the gem can describe the wave - function asymptotics at large @xmath0 to reasonable precision . taking this advantage , we investigate density distribution of axially deformed drip - line nuclei , within the mean - field approximation .",
    "we here discuss in the hf framework .",
    "wave function @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spwf ] ) can be decomposed by a sum of spherical wave functions , @xmath50 here @xmath51 with @xmath52 , which is defined by the @xmath53-projection on @xmath49 besides a constant factor .",
    "the nuclear force becomes negligible at sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "there the coordinate - represented hf hamiltonian for neutrons becomes approximately spherically symmetric and the components having different @xmath5 decouple to one another  @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling , which is an effect of the nuclear force , also becomes negligible , and thereby the @xmath54 ( and @xmath55 ) value is frozen .",
    "after each @xmath53 component propagates over a certain region of @xmath0 , @xmath49 will be dominated by the @xmath56 component of the lowest possible @xmath5 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath57 , with the sign fixed by the parity ) due to the centrifugal barrier  @xcite , although the degree of the dominance depends on characters of the deformed orbit .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath58 at large @xmath0 is @xmath59 with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the s.p .",
    "hence the neutron density distribution asymptotically behaves as @xmath62 where the subscript @xmath63 represents the highest occupied level , @xmath64 is determined by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 stands for the occupation number on the level @xmath63 .",
    "we hereafter assume @xmath68 without loss of generality , owing to the reflection symmetry .    in connection to halos ,",
    "the @xmath69 and @xmath70 cases are particularly interesting . for @xmath69 , which implicates @xmath71 and @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp ] ) is reduced to @xmath73 giving isotropic density in the asymptotic region .",
    "hence halos formed by @xmath74 last nucleon are spherically symmetric , as long as the @xmath75 components can be neglected . for @xmath76 which presumes @xmath77 , there are two possibilities @xmath72 and @xmath78 . in the @xmath79 case ,",

    "( [ eq : asymp1b ] ) can also be deformed , and its degree depends on @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , within the hf approximation , a deformed halo is expected in axially deformed drip - line nuclei with the last nucleon occupying a @xmath84 or @xmath85 orbit .",
    "connected to the nilsson model , the asymptotic quantum numbers have widely been used in description of well - deformed nuclei , comprising @xmath55 ( denoted by @xmath86 in the nilsson model ) . therefore @xmath54 becomes an approximate quantum number .",
    "if this is the case , one of @xmath87 is much greater than the other in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp1b ] ) . then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath88 depends largely on direction in the @xmath89 case . in the extreme case where one of @xmath90 vanishes , the damping factor @xmath91 is missing in a certain direction ; if @xmath92 , @xmath93 damps according to the @xmath91 factor in the @xmath6 direction , but damps faster in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 directions",
    "the absence of the @xmath91 asymptotic component is significant only in the vicinity of the @xmath96 plane .",
    "hence a neck structure of a halo is expected for drip - line nuclei with @xmath89 that is dominated by the @xmath97 component .",
    "in contrast , the density in nuclei with @xmath98 or @xmath99 dominated by @xmath100 may have dips on the @xmath6 axis , forming a halo with an apple - like shape .",
    "in the mg isotopes , the neutron - drip line has been predicted to lie at @xmath101 in several mean - field calculations so far  @xcite . in a recent experiment @xmath1 mg has been confirmed to be bound  @xcite .",

    "@xcite ; @xmath1 mg is bound while @xmath102 mg has higher energy than @xmath1 mg . in the present hf result @xmath1 mg has a prolate shape at its energy minimum , with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it is noted that this energy is appreciably lower than in the @xmath106 ho calculation  @xcite .",
    "this is probably connected to the spatial extension of the wave function shown below .",
    "the last two neutrons , which have @xmath107 , occupy a @xmath84 orbit that has large portion of the @xmath108 component by @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath110 for this orbit . applying the above argument",
    ", it is likely that @xmath88 of @xmath1 mg has a halo oriented to the @xmath6 direction , but this halo component is almost missing on the @xmath96 plane , leading to neck structure of the neutron halo .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - mg40 ] , @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath113 of @xmath1 mg are depicted .",

    "we find halo structure in @xmath117 at @xmath118 with the asymptotic behavior that is consistent with @xmath119 to good approximation .",
    "it is remarked that the component with the same asymptotics is highly suppressed in the @xmath94 direction .",
    "mg in the @xmath94 ( dashed lines ) and the @xmath6 ( solid lines ) directions , calculated with the d1s interaction .",

    "[ fig : rhcnt - mg ] . for comparison ,",
    "similar plots for @xmath31 mg and @xmath44 mg are given as well .",
    "all the three mg nuclei have prolate deformation in the present hf calculation .",
    "the equi - density lines distribute with almost equal intervals from @xmath121 to @xmath122 , indicating exponential decrease of @xmath123 . with the exception of @xmath93 in @xmath1 mg",
    ", the size of the intervals does not depend on direction .",
    "although the @xmath124 line in @xmath31 mg is slightly constricted in the @xmath94 direction , it could be influenced by deviation from the exponential asymptotics due to numerical errors .",
    "the contour plot of @xmath93 in @xmath1 mg is intriguing .",
    "the large intervals of the equi - density lines correspond to the slow damping of @xmath93 due to the small @xmath119 . however , the intervals are comparable to those in @xmath44 mg in the @xmath94 direction .",
    "we view the neck structure in the low @xmath93 region .",

    "[ fig : rhcnt - mg ] ]    because it mixes the @xmath97 and @xmath70 components , the pair correlation tends to restore the spherical symmetry in the density distribution in the asymptotic region .",
    "depending on degree of the mixing , the neck structure may survive or disappear .",
    "however , in the present hfb calculation with the d1s interaction , we do not find a superfluid solution having lower energy than the hf minimum in @xmath1 mg .",
    "thus the density distribution of @xmath1 mg shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho - mg40 ] and [ fig : rhcnt - mg ] is not altered .",
    "if the @xmath75 components remain sizable in the asymptotic region , deformed halos ( including neck structure ) with other @xmath130 may be present . in ref .",
    "@xcite , possibility of deformed halos depending on the direction was pointed out for @xmath131be and @xmath132c , based on the skyrme hfb calculations .",
    "those halos are formed by a @xmath133 orbit .",
    "there remain problems with respect to deformed halos : ( a ) how correlations beyond hfb ( including restoration of the rotational symmetry ) affect them , and ( b ) whether they are detectable in experiments .",
