    "for many actual practical solutions and technological applications , due to the impressive development of low - dimensional electronic and optoelectronic devices , it is drastically important to include the valence - band mixing @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the degree of freedom transverse to the main transport direction , whenever the holes are involved .",
    "this phenomenology , early quoted by wessel and altarelli in resonant tunneling @xcite , has been lately pointed up for real - life technological devices @xcite .",
    "if the electronic transport through these systems , engage both electrons and holes , the low - dimensional device response depends on the slower - heavier charge - carrier s motion through specific potential regions @xcite .",
    "it is unavoidable to recognize that in the specialized literature there is plenty of reports studying several physical phenomena derived from hole mixing effects and strain , _ via _ standard existing methods .",
    "some authors had managed to determine optimal situation in a resonant tunneling of holes under internal strains , disregarding scattering effects and assuming a spatial symmetry for a constant potential @xcite . a fundamental study on valence - band mixing in first - principles , established a non - linear response for a pseudo - potential in series of the atomic distribution function @xcite .",
    "valence - band mixing and/or strain had been extensively studied over the past few decades in several nanostructures ranging from quantum wells @xcite , to quantum wires @xcite and to quantum dots @xcite .",
    "however , just a few reports are available , concerning the very evolution itself of the effective potential due to several causes , as a central topic of research .",
    "we underline in the present paper the focus not on valence - band mixing and strain effects problem in general , but rather on the particular metamorphosis of the effective potential while manipulating both effects .",
    "we hope to make some progress in understanding the underlaying physics as well as determine whether or not the valence - band mixing and strain are competitors mechanism in the evolution of the effective potential .",
    "earliest striking elucidations due to milanovi and tjapkin for electrons,@xcite and recalled much later by prez - lvarez and garca - moliner for a fully unspecific multiband theoretical case,@xcite are fundamental cornerstones in this concern .",
    "the metamorphosis of the effective _ band offset _ potential @xmath0 ,  felt \" by charge carriers depending on the transverse momentum value , is so far , the better way to graphically mimic , the phenomenon of the in - plane dependence of the effective mass , also refereed as the valence - band mixing for holes . in few words ,",
    "a hole band mixing is crucial for bulk and low - dimensional confined systems possessing quantal heterogeneity , a question soon to be discussed in this paper , inspired in a similar scenario , as was done before for a single - band - electron problem @xcite .",
    "particularities of the appealing evolution features of @xmath0 for holes , in the presence of gradually increasing valence - band mixing and strain , could be of interest for condensed - matter physicists , working in the area of quantum transport for multiband - multichannel models . while previous studies in quantum systems have added substantial contributions to the elucidation of the valence - subband structure @xcite , and the influence of the hole mixing on it @xcite , there remain some aspects which do not appear to have received yet sufficient attention and/or because of their interest deserve further clarification .",
    "this is essentially the case of the strain influence together with carriers transverse motion connection with the @xmath0 they interact with , which are the main porpoises under investigation here .",
    "we assume the last , widely understood as crucial for charge and spin carriers quantum transport calculations through standard quantum barrier(qb ) ",
    "quantum well(qw ) layered systems .    on general grounds , @xmath0",
    "is given by the difference for @xmath2 band edge levels as long as the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) values are negligible.@xcite for finite @xmath3 , this assertion is no longer valid and the mixing effects reveal .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this behavior , is the increment of the @xmath3-quadratic proportional term , yielding even to invert the roles of qw and qb @xcite .",
    "some authors had declared a shift upward in energy , of the bound states in the effective potential well as the transverse wave vector increases @xcite . by letting grow @xmath3 , were found the valence - band mixing effects to arise and @xmath0 to change @xcite .",
    "they conclude a larger reduction for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 , for light holes ( _ lh _ ) respect to that for heavy holes ( _ hh _ ) @xcite . these former works",
    "@xcite , were motivating enough and put us on an effort to try a more comprehensive vision , of how @xmath0 evolves spatially with @xmath3 and strain , for _ hh _ and _ lh_. this paper is devoted to demonstrate , the feasibility of the @xmath0 profile evolution , qb - qw permutations , and bandgap changes , as a reliable follow - up tools for finding the response of a layered semiconductor system with spatial - dependent effective mass , on travelling holes throughout it , by tuning the valence - band mixing and including stress effects .    built - in elastic strained layered heterostructures , has been remarkably used in the last decade , for development of light - emitting diodes , lasers , solar cells and photodetectors.@xcite besides , internal strain may results into a considerably modification of the electronic structure of both electrons and holes , thereby altering the response of strained systems respect to nominal behavior of strain - free designs.@xcite we get motivated about the probable existence of a competitor mechanism able to diminish the effects of valence - band mixing on @xmath0 , or wipe them out occasionally .",
    "thus , owing to the need to account for strain in the present study , we additionally suppose the heterostructure sandwiched into an arbitrary configuration of pseudomorphically strained sequence of qw - acting and qb - acting binary(ternary ) allows , due technological interest in that configuration . whenever on layer - by - layer deposition , the epitaxially grown layer s lattice parameter matches that of the substrate in the in - plane direction without collateral dislocations or vacancies , the process is referred as pseudomorphic [ see fig .",
