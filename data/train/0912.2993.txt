    "the observation of polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and its correlation to the temperature anisotropies is a very promising tool to test the physics of early universe .",
    "the cmb radiation is expected to be linearly polarized of the order of 10 % .",
    "this linearity is a result of the anisotropic compton scattering around the epoch of recombination which has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a linearly polarized radiation is described by non - zero values for the stokes parameters @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 . meanwhile the possibility of the generation of circular polarization can be determined by the stokes parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this parameter is usually given to be zero in the literature because there is no physical mechanism to generate a stokes - v contribution at the last scattering surface .",
    "however the circular polarization can be generated naturally if a background magnetic field be present .",
    "recently , giovannini has shown that if the cmb photons are scattered via electrons in the presence of a magnetic field , a non - vanishing @xmath2 mode can be produced @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cooray , melchiorri and silk have discussed that the cmb radiation observed today is not exactly the same as the field last scattered @xcite .",
    "the cmb polarization may change during the propagation from the last scattering surface due to the presence of relativistic magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters . on the basis of the mechanism described in @xcite ,",
    "the linear polarization of the cmb can be converted to the circular polarization under the formalism of the generalized faraday rotation @xcite known as the faraday conversion @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the stokes parameter @xmath2 given by this mechanism is obtained as = 2u , where @xmath3 is the faraday conversion phase shift @xcite .",
    "assuming reasonable parameters for the relativistic magnetized plasma in the galaxy clusters and for @xmath4 , one can estimate the faraday conversion phase shift as @xmath5 .",
    "then with a cmb polarization of the order of @xmath6 which propagates through the galaxy clusters , the outgoing beam should contain a circular polarization of order @xmath7 at scales corresponding to the galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that such an effect arise due to new physics effects .",
    "for instance another mechanism for generating the circular polarization has been reported by alexander , ochoa and kosowsky in @xcite . in this method",
    "the photon sector of quantum electrodynamics is extended so that photon is coupled to an external constant 4-vector @xmath8 via a chern - simons like term as &&=_maxwell+_t + & & = -f_f^+g^a_t _ f_,[lo ] where @xmath9 is a lorentz symmetry violation cpt odd term and @xmath10 is the coupling constant of interaction . then the collision term on the right hand side of the boltzmann equation",
    "is corrected by the interaction ( [ lo ] ) . the generalized boltzmann equation considered in this reference",
    "is given by the quantum - mechanical evolution of the photon density matrix .",
    "in fact it is shown that the time derivative of the polarization brightness associated with the stokes parameter @xmath2 receives a source term such that the @xmath2 mode becomes nonzero .",
    "also in reference @xcite , finellia and galavernid have considered an axion - like cosmological pseudoscalar field acting as dark matter coupled to the photons as = -f_^ ,    where @xmath11 is the coupling constant between axion field @xmath12 and the electromagnetic field strength @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then it has been shown that such an interaction between the pseudoscalar field and photons rotates the plane of linear polarization and generates the circular polarization for the cosmic microwave background .",
    "a similar approach with the pseudoscalar photon mixing shows a cmb circular polarization up to the order of @xmath15 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address new possibilities and propose new channels to produce the circular polarization for the cmb in three different contexts .",
    "first we consider the qed part of an effective field theory for lorentz violation ( lv ) symmetry @xcite that is called the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite . in this case we only investigate that lorentz violation terms of sme that have not been considered in @xcite .",
    "then we examine the noncommutative qed ( ncqed ) with seiberg - witten expansion of fields @xcite as well as the presence of the primordial magnetic field background in the last scattering surface @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we use the generalized boltzmann equation formulated in @xcite , to study the evolution of stokes parameter @xmath2 under the influence of these new phenomena .",
    "this equation shows that a non - zero background field can generate the circular polarization through either the interaction of photon with the background itself or the corrections on the compton scattering of photon on the electron in the presence of the background field .",
    "one should note that the quantum corrections on the scattering cross section , for the low energy particles , are usually negligible .",
    "nevertheless , the circular polarization of cmb itself as a small quantity can be produced potentially via accumulation of these small effects .",
    "on the dimensional ground one can expect @xmath3 at the lowest order depends on the appropriate combination of the parameters of the model which is dimensionless .",
    "therefore , for the magnetic field @xmath3 should be proportional to @xmath16 that is about @xmath17 for the micro gauss magnetic field .",
    "meanwhile in the nc space it should be depended on @xmath18 which is of the order @xmath19 for @xmath20 about 10 tev . for the lorentz violation case",
    "the faraday conversion phase should be linearly proportional to the dimensionless lv - parameters which are less than the present existing bound about @xmath21 .",
    "therefore at first sight it seems that the effect of the magnetic field is at least two order of magnitudes less than the other new interactions .",
    "but as we will show soon this is not the case and due to the wavelength dependence of the solutions the background magnetic field has main contribution on the polarization of the cmb .",
    "however , it should be also noted that the resulting circular polarization modes are certainly small due to the smallness of quantum effects .",
    "meanwhile the probe of circular polarization of the cmb radiation through the future subtle experiments , certainly give more information about the new physics or the primordial magnetic fields in the early universe . the main condition which is assumed everywhere during the paper",
    "is a cold plasma at the last scattering surface at a red shift of about @xmath22 or an age of about @xmath23 and a temperature of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "the low temperature is always applicable for the calculation of the compton scattering amplitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the stokes parameters formalism and the generalized boltzmann equation . in section 3 the generation of circular polarization due to the lorentz violation is discussed . in section 4 the same calculation is done for the noncommutativity . in section 5",
    "we examine the generation of circular polarization in the presence of a background magnetic field . finally in the last section we discuss about the result .",
    "the polarization of cmb is usually characterized by means of the stokes parameters of radiation : i , q , u and v @xcite . for a quasi - monochromatic wave propagating in the z - direction , in which the electric and magnetic fields vibrate on the x - y plane , the electric field @xmath25 in a given point can be written as e_x = a_x(t)(_0t-_x ) , e_y = a_y(t ) ( _ 0t- _ y),[ee ] where the wave is nearly monochromatic with frequency @xmath26 .",
    "then the stokes parameters are defined by time averaging of the parameters of electric fields ( [ ee ] ) as follows & & i+ , + & & q- , + & & u , + & & v .",
    "these parameters are physically interpreted as follows : i is the total intensity of wave , q measures the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath28 polarization , the parameter u gives the phase information for the two linear polarization and v determines the difference between positive and negative circular polarization . the time evolution of these stokes parameters is given through boltzmann equation .",
    "we now turn to the boltzmann equation which is vital in our study .",
    "the cmb radiation is generally described by the phase space distribution function @xmath29 for each polarization state .",
    "boltzmann equation is a systematic mechanism in order to describe the evolution of the distribution function under gravity and collisions .",
    "the classical boltzmann equation generally is written as @xcite = c[f ] , where the left hand side is known as the liouville term deals with the effects of gravitational perturbations about the homogeneous cosmology .",
    "an important point that must be mentioned here is that we have disregarded the scalar fluctuation of metric on the left hand side of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the right hand side of the boltzmann equation contains all possible collision terms . for photons ,",
    "the compton scattering with free electrons , @xmath30 , is more important and must be included on the right hand side . to compute the evolution of polarization",
    "we follow the approach of references @xcite . at first , the distribution function @xmath29 is generalized to the density matrix @xmath31 & & = (    cccc i+q & u - i v + u+iv & i - q +    ) + & & = ( i+q_3+u_1+v_2),[matrix ] where @xmath32 is the identity matrix and @xmath33 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the density matrix @xmath31 is related to the number operator @xmath34 as [ eq:3.17 ] _ ij(*k * ) = ( 2)^3 2k^0^(3)(0)_ij(*k*).and the time evolution of the number operator is given by    @xmath35 \\rangle -\\int_0^t dt ' \\langle [ \\mathcal{\\hat h}_{\\text{int}}(t - t ' ) , [ \\mathcal{\\hat h}_{\\text{int}}(t ' ) , \\mathcal{\\hat d}_{ij } ] ] \\rangle .\\ ] ]    hence in terms of @xmath36 , the evolution equation leads to @xmath37\\rangle -   \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt'\\phantom{1 }          \\langle [   \\mathcal{\\hat h}_{\\text{int}}(t'),[\\mathcal{\\hat h}_{\\text{int}}(0),\\mathcal{\\hat d}_{ij}({\\bf k})]]\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the first term on the right hand side is referred as the refractive term and the second one as the damping term",
    ". note that in ( [ gb0 ] ) , all factors of @xmath38 will be canceled from the final expressions .",
    "equation ( [ gb0 ] ) can be viewed as a quantum mechanical boltzmann equation for the phase space function @xmath36 . in the case where the interaction term is the convenient qed interaction ,",
    "the time evolution of the stokes parameter @xmath2 is always equal to zero which leads to the absence of circular degrees of freedom for the cmb photons . in this paper during the next sections , we will show that if one consider beyond standard model interaction terms , the time evolution of the @xmath2 receives a source term which is interpreted as a non - zero circular polarization .",
    "if the stokes parameter @xmath2 be non - zero , then it contributes on the new angular power spectrum elements such as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 where may be detectable in future cmb experiments .",
    "in the present section we consider a new class of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) terms as a generic class of interaction between photons and an external field and explore whether they can produce circular polarization for the cmb photons or not .",
    "although the source of these asymmetry terms is unknown , physicists usually suppose that they come from presumably short - distance physics which manifest themselves in the interactions of standard model ( sm ) fields @xcite .",
    "the renormalizable sector of the general qed extension for a single dirac field @xmath42 of mass @xmath43 and a photon also has been studied by some authors for which the lagrangian @xmath44 is written as = _",

    "we consider the three remaining terms in the liv lagrangian .",

    "meanwhile if we integrate ( [ m21 ] ) over the momentum @xmath88 and use the approximation @xmath99 then one can see that the correction will be proportional to @xmath167 as follows    @xmath168    where @xmath169 can be easily define by comparing ( [ m21 ] ) and ( [ m22 ] ) . here again one can estimate the faraday phase conversion for @xmath170 as _ fc~1 rad ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) .",
    "in this work we have considered the evolution of the stokes parameters in the context of a general extension of quantum electrodynamics allowing for lorentz violation ( lvqed ) , ncqed and in the presence of the background magnetic field .",
    "in fact all nonzero backgrounds can potentially produce the circular polarization for the cmb radiation . in the lvqed",
    "we have explored three cases , one case in the photon sector and two cases in the electron sector . in the former one",
    "the induced circular polarization is provided through the interaction of photon with the background lorentz violation field , eq.([lvp ] ) , while in the latter cases the corrections on the compton scattering in the lvqed cause the polarization , see eqs.([eq : lvc ] ) and ( [ lvd ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the stokes parameter v in both sectors are linearly proportional to the dimensionless lorentz parameters @xmath48 and @xmath171 that is in contrast with the result of @xcite where the second term of lagrangian ( [ ext ] ) is considered as the interaction term and it is found that v depends quadratically on the @xmath172 that is too small with respect to our result . we have also estimated the faraday phase conversion in the lv case to give an upper bound on the dimensionless lorentz parameters @xmath173 and @xmath48 about @xmath174 that is comparable to the current bounds on these parameters . in the ncqed we have found the nonzero parameter v through a correction on the compton scattering in the nc space that is linearly proportional with the parameter of non commutativity as given in ( [ lvpolar1 ] ) .",
    "our estimation on the faraday phase conversion is about @xmath116 radians for @xmath175 that is too small to be detectable .",
    "finally we have examined the stokes parameter v for the background magnetic field . in this case",
    "the refractive term is zero but the damping term has a nonzero v parameter that depends linearly on the magnetic field , see eq.([m22 ] ) .",
    "this result can be compared with the result of @xcite in which the circular polarization of cmb due to the faraday conversion depends quadratically on the background magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , in contrast with @xcite , all the other stokes parameters ( i , q and u ) have some contributions on the generation of the stokes - v parameter in the background magnetic field . in fact it is not necessary a prior linear polarization to have a nonzero stokes - v parameter that is in agreement with references @xcite . by comparing our results together",
    "we see a @xmath167-dependence for the magnetic field and lv on one hand and @xmath176-dependence for non - commutativity on the other hand which leads to different spectrum for different wavelengths . because the required sensitivity level to detect circular polarization of cmb is beyond the current instrumental techniques , the experimental bound on the @xmath2 modes is rare .",
    "the bound reported in @xcite , constrains it as @xmath177 . however , the post - planck cmb polarization experiments are already under study @xcite",
    ". then it is time to address the question whether cmb is circularly polarized or not and what physical information can be extracted from its measurement .",
    "also it seems that if a new experimental device can be built with sufficient polarimetric sensitivity beyond the @xmath178 range and with good control of systematic errors , the resulting observations may have the potential to realize the physics at energy scales far beyond the reach of the largest feasible particle accelerators and provide a window to new physics at these energy scales .",
    "therefore we encourage experimenters to make experiments in order to measure the circular polarization of cosmic microwave radiation .",

    "the electron propagator can be also calculated straightforwardly with a correction in the denominator as @xmath183 since @xmath184 , the propagator can be expanded up to the linear order of @xmath185 as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the usual electron propagator .",
