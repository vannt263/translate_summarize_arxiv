    "[ flin - k ] using observables reflects treating first - class quadratic constraints , @xmath8 , distinctly from first - class linear ones @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the problem of time literature @xcite is replete with reasons why this may be desirable ; moreover also observables are more straightforward to find than dirac ones .",
    "indeed , the _ problem of observables _  that it is hard to construct a sufficiently large set of these to describe all physical quantities , especially for gravitational theory ",
    "is one of the many facets of the problem of time .",
    "observables are more straightforward to construct than dirac ones , and classical ones are more straightforward to construct than quantum ones .",
    "the problem of observables remains little understood .",
    "strategies proposed in this regard include the following .",
    "strategy 1 ) insist upon constructing dirac observables , @xmath5 .",
    "strategy 2 ) make use of unconstrained observables , @xmath6 @xcite .    in strategy 2 ) case one is disregarding all the information content of the constraints .",
    "however , on some occasions strategy 2 ) is used as a stepping stone to constructing dirac - type observables .",
    "strategy 3 ) consider observables , @xmath7 , to suffice .",
    "some examples are also useful at this stage . in unconstrained theories ,",
    "all three notions coincide . in theories",
    "whose sole constraint is first - class quadratic , unconstrained and observables are coincident , trivial and distinct from dirac observables , which are nontrivial .",
    "this applies to minisuperspace models and to some of the simplest relational mechanics @xcite models . in electromagnetism and yang ",
    "mills theory , on the other hand , all the constraints are first - class linear , so dirac and observables coincide and are distinct from unconstrained observables .",
    "finally , in more advanced relational mechanics theories @xcite and in gr , there are first - class linear constraints and a first - class quadratic constraint . here , none of the above three notions of observables coincide .",
    "in particular , for gr the first - class linear constraints are the vector - valued gr momentum constraint @xmath10 , whereas the first - class quadratic constraint is the scalar - valued gr hamiltonian constraint @xmath11 .",
    "the observables then obey _ i k _ 0 , [ k_gr ] where @xmath12 is specifically the poisson bracket . for relational mechanics , @xmath13 which has the mathematical form of a quadratic energy constraint takes over the role of @xmath11 . here",
    "many examples observables are known explicitly @xcite : they are shapes , or shapes and scales , for various different notions of shape @xcite , and conjugate quantities . for electromagnetism ,",
    "the observables forms are also well - understood @xcite , however for gr they remain only formally understood @xcite .",
    "the next consideration of note is dirac s conjecture , by which first - class linear constraints would always coincide with gauge constraints .",
    "unfortunately , this is false @xcite . due to this",
    ", a fourth notion of observable is unearthed : the @xmath14-observables @xmath15 which commute with all of a theory s gauge constraints : g _ g _ 0 ; @xmath14 is that gauge theory s underlying gauge group .",
    "of course , for some theories @xmath9 and @xmath16 coincide , in which case @xmath7 and @xmath15 coincide as well ; e.g. this is the case in relational mechanics , electromagnetism and yang  mills theory .    strategy 4 ) is then to consider @xmath14-observables observables to suffice .",
    "the next development follows from perceiving that a notion of observables being meaningful is contingent on the subset of constraints it commutes with a fortiori closing as a subalgebraic structure @xcite ( lemma 1 of appendix [ observables ] ) .",
    "in particular , in some cases the @xmath9 do not close , and thus indeed the notion of observables @xmath7 does not exist for that theory . in problem of time considerations , this means that many approaches to the problem of observables can only be addressed once the constraint closure problem has been resolved @xcite .",
    "i.e. one needs the constraints algebraic structure prior to consideration of associated observables algebraic structures .",
    "it is also required that the notion of bracket involved in defining the @xmath17 matches that under which the @xmath3 close . additionally , by appendix [ observables ] s lemma 2 , the @xmath17 themselves form a closed algebraic structure .",
    "[ it is , moreover , interesting that observables algebraic structures exhibit some conceptual similarities with theory of casimirs : appendix [ associated ] , which proved to be a central ingredient in understanding ( much simpler ) algebraic structures : lie groups and their reps . ]    along the above lines , focus shifts from observables to the observables associated with whichever closed subalgebraic structures each theory s constraint algebraic structure happens to possess .",
    "i term these a - observables , where the ` a ' stands for ` algebraic substructure ' .",
    "the subalgebraic structures of a gives algebraic structure then turn out to form a bounded lattice ( appendix [ lattices ] ) under the inclusion operation .",
    "the association by ` forms zero brackets with ' then produces in a further lattice , now of notions of observables .",
    "this pair of bounded lattice structures form the current article s main underlying result .",
    "fig [ latt-1 ] gives preliminary versions of this involving @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath15 .",
    "the current article illustrates this with nontrivial examples of notions of a - observable arising in relational mechanics , slightly inhomogeneous cosmology and supergravity , in secs 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "we conclude in sec 4 with a more general account of the lattice of constraint subalgebraic structures and of the associated lattice of notions of a - observables .",
    "discussion of the article s range of algebraic concepts is difered to a multi - part appendix .",
    "the constraint algebraic structures for these are outlined appendix [ cas ] .",
    "some of the constraint subalgebras are then given in fig [ latt-2 ] , alongside the associated notions of a - observables .",
    "in this model @xcite @xmath18 , and one splits modewise ( each mode corresponds to collection of @xmath19-harmonics labels ) and into scalar , vector and tensor ( svt ) parts .",
    "this splits @xmath11 into @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 pieces , and @xmath10 into @xmath23 and @xmath24 pieces .",
    "modewise and svt - wise splits give decoupled equations at the unreduced level , to lowest nontrivial perturbative order .",
    "it then turns out that @xcite taking out @xmath23 and @xmath24 fails to take out all of the @xmath25 information left in the model .",
    "the amount by which it fails to do so depends on whether one is considering the single minimally coupled scalar field matter version @xcite or the vacuum version @xcite . in the vacuum case , it is out by 1 configuration space degree of freedom , whereas it is out by 2 in the scalar field case .",
    "the vacuum case also has a more decoupled partly reduced system , by which it is clear @xcite that removing @xmath21 suffices to take one down to @xmath25 invariance , i.e. to this model s counterpart of @xmath26 .",
    "it is this vacuum case that the current article considers in detail ; the scalar field counterpart remains only partly understood . in this vacuum case , then , the constraint algebraic structure is as in fig [ latt-3].a ) and the corresponding notions of observables are as in fig [ latt-3].b ) .",
    "firstly , note that observables and @xmath14-observables  for @xmath27  are distinct in this example .",
    "i also term the latter superspace observables .",
    "secondly , note that there are additional notions of a - observables , for which i suggest the names s - observables and v - observables , meaning commutation with just @xmath23 and just @xmath24 respectively .",
    "taking out just @xmath24 has a scalar field case parallel which underlies wada s even more partial reduction in @xcite ; he then proceeded to reduce out @xmath23 as well @xcite .",
    "introducing a local lorentz frame formulation to accommodate the model s fermionic species causes a local lorentz frame constraint @xmath28 ( and its conjugate ) to appear .",
    "the canonical formulation of supergravity then has the expected @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath28 constraints alongside a specifically supersymmetric constraint @xmath29 .",
    "all we need to know for this article about @xmath28 and @xmath29 are that each of these constraints is linear in the momenta , and the schematic form of the subsequent constraint brackets , as per appendix [ cas ] .",
    "the particular feature this article concentrates upon is that in supergravity a subset of the linear constraints  the supersymmetry constraints  have the supergravity counterpart of the quadratic @xmath30 as _ their _ integrability ; this follows from eq ( [ s - s->h ] ) .",
    "this means that observables are not well - defined for supergravity , since the quadratic @xmath11 now arises as an integrability of the linear @xmath29 .",
    "eq ( [ s - s->h ] ) forms the second integrability of the ` two - way ' pair , to the first integrability being of form ( [ dirac - algebroid ] ) .",
    "some constraint subalgebraic structures of note are then provided in fig [ latt-3 ] .",
    "in particular , the non - supersymmetric linear constraint combination of @xmath28 and @xmath10 closes , as does the gr - like combination of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and the non - supersymmetric combination of @xmath28 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "i term the corresponding notions of a - observables non - supersymmetric , gr - likes and non - supersymmetric dirac @xcite .",
    "there is a notion of observables associated with each constraint subalgebraic structure that a given theory s constraint algebraic structure happens to possess .",
    "i term these , collectively , a - observables ( fig [ latt-5 ] ) .",
    "both the constraint subalgebraic structures of a given theory s constraint algebraic structure , and the theory s notion of a - observables form bounded lattice structures .",
    "the dirac observables @xmath5 correspond to the zero of the latter lattice , arising from considering the whole constraint algebraic structure , which is the unit of the former lattice . on the other hand",
    ", the unconstrained observables @xmath6 correspond to the unit of the latter lattice , arising from considering the trivial subalgebraic structure ( i d ) , which is the zero of the former lattice .",
    "once this context has been framed , it is clear that the notion observables  commuting with first - class linear constraints  is only one some occasions well - defined .",
    "this becomes seen , rather , as an early example of nontrivial a - observable ( i.e. neither unconstrained nor dirac ) , which is realized in some theories  such as gr  but not others  such as supergravity .",
    "thus approaches to quantum gravity which depend on the quadratic to linear distinction between constraints , and the subsequent notion of observables , can be fragile to change of theory .",
    "this is to be contrasted with how @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined for _ all _ theories .",
    "moreover , other interesting closed subalgebraic structures arise , each with an associated notion of a - observable . in the current article , we have discussed a number of such , and coined names for them .",
