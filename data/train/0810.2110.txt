    "physical elements of quantum information tasks are bounded to imperfections , decoherence or inclusively self distortion by natural interactions between their parts . under this perspective , it is necessary introduce alternate elements to the quantum information process which take care to correct these deviations from the expected ideal behavior .",
    "classical control is the science which treat with this kind of problem , obtaining some information by measuring , analizing and feedbacking the system in order to come back it to this ideal behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the classical control was developed for systems which should be tolerant to noise or fault parts , upon supposition that these systems are not altered by measuring or at least altered in a quantifiable amount .",
    "nevertheless quantum systems havent this classical behavior because this alteration upon measurement is not completely quantifiable . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "some kind of control is based on to exploit the properties of system in order to driving it @xcite . but process to introduce control schemes in a classical sense on qubits has been recently developed taking measurements and giving feedback to them @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume a double task . mainly to extend the control process proposed by braczyk @xcite and xi @xcite to bipartite states ( particularly in entangled states which are highly important in quantum computation and quantum information processes ) , but at the same time to study the effect of self interactions in noise or distortion introduction to ideal systems because of interaction between different parts of it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to explain ising interaction model to use as immediate and temporal source of distortion after of his creation or preparation .",
    "section iii shows the behavior of initial states which motivate the necessity to introduce quantum control . in section iv and v , basic and simple control and his performance",
    "are discussed for pure states .",
    "section vi extends some findings for mixed states and discusses the following program to improve the results .",
    "ising model is motivated mainly by far - field strength of a dipole magnetic interaction between two particles .",
    "the classical ising model is :    @xmath0    nevertheless that this kind of interactions were first used in statistical physics to describe the magnetic behavior of lattices in different ways precisely by ising @xcite and after by heisenberg @xcite in quantum mechanics , the interaction in the most symmetrical ways has been recently considered by other authors to study transference and control of entanglement in bipartite qubits @xcite and lattices @xcite .",
    "in addition , cai @xcite has considered an more general model in order to study the relation between entanglement and local information .",
    "some interesting properties for this model in three dimensions on just two part systems and adding an inhomogeneous magnetic field in the @xmath1 direction has been recently studied @xcite , obtaining a description of evolution and showing specific properties between entanglement and control .",
    "we will use this last model for interaction between particles :    @xmath2    which have the evolution operator @xcite in dirac notation :    @xmath3    with :    @xmath4 , \\nonumber \\\\   & j = j / r \\in [ 0,1/2 ] , t'=rt \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .",
    "where : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "we will drop the prime in the time in the following .",
    "the problem which we are dealing is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "a system generates with the same probability one state at time from a set of two non - equivalent entangled states .",
    "we do nt know which was the state produced .",
    "after of that , some kind of noise or distortion is introduced on the state produced , emerging to observer as a modified state which needs to be analyzed by measurement in order to reconstruct it into the original in the best possible way .",
    "we center our attention on the following alternative situations in presence of some uncontrolled inhomogeneus magnetic field , which induces distortion by some time @xmath8 :    * * situation 1 : * the observer tries to correct the distortion begining in some definite time still in presence of the original field , thinking that distortion has been acting by time @xmath8 , or * * situation 2 : * after of distortion , suddenly , the two particles are set far away one of each other , stopping ising and magnetic field interactions , then the observer begins the correction of the state      if we begin with the following distinguishable bipartite states @xmath9 and @xmath10 :    @xmath11    with :    @xmath12    for @xmath13 , which is a set of orthonormal states .",
    "it s noticeable that :    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the standard bell states .",
    "nevertheless last formulae give some explanation for constitution of the bipartite states in terms of certain pure entangled states , the most important technical aspect is that parameter @xmath17 lets us have a wider spectrum of states to compare . trace distance has been used to measure distinguishability between two states @xcite . for our states ,",
    "this measure is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "so , the last state , @xmath21 , goes from a very similar state to @xmath22 when @xmath23 until a very different state when @xmath24 .      in the scheme introduced by braczyk @xcite and xi @xcite",
    "the task is identify between two similar states after that some kind of noise or distortion is introduced . in an alternative way",
    ", this paper consider another kind of noise or distortion that those authors , because dephasing noise and bit flipping noise do nt affect the entangled bipartite system which we are considering .",
    "ising interaction leave invariant our initial states ( [ initialstates ] ) in absence of magnetic field @xcite , but the aim of this work is inquire about how the additional presence of the field ( by example an parasite magnetic field ) introduces an effective distortion . according with hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the evolution of each state after of time @xmath8 of interaction we have :    @xmath25    calculating @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we can verify that this distortion is trace distance preserving : @xmath28 .",
    "the first evolved state is maximally entangled always but the second not ; the schmidt coefficients for this last state become :    @xmath29    which are periodic just if @xmath30 ( see also @xcite ) , so the argument of square root is equal to zero ( maximally entangled ) only in non periodic times and distorted states will become normally partial entangled in addition @xcite .",
    "a very basic control as was introduced in @xcite could solve the distortion introduced in before section . here",
    "two aspect were introduced : the first one is the periodical behavior of evolution operator ( [ evolop ] ) for @xmath31 and the second is the concept of evolution loops ( or more precisely , the operation of time reversion introduced in @xcite , which completes a definite evolution into an evolution loop ) .",
    "for the situation 1 depicted in section iii , observer still could use the inhomogeneus field to induce a reconstruction of the original state .",
    "this scheme of reconstruction is independent of the initial state .",
    "so , observer could retrieve the original state but without know it .",
    "the scheme is simple , by adding an extra homogeneous magnetic field by some time @xmath32 ( note that this traduces just in a greater average field @xmath33 because @xmath34 remains unchanged and so the renormalization ( [ rescaling ] ) remains valid ) we obtain the evolution :    @xmath35    after of time @xmath36 . by select the parameters :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 means some rational approximation to @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 as denominator , by the selection of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "so closest to @xmath39 as be possible ( in case that @xmath31 , then @xmath42 and selection is direct but with several options ) , we obtain ( until unitary factors ) a quasi evolution loop : @xmath43 with @xmath44 as diagonal matrix : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .    note that @xmath44 expression does nt converge to @xmath47 always because precision of rational approximation to @xmath39 it s inverse to @xmath40",
    ", so @xmath48 does nt converge to zero ( at least that @xmath39 will be rational ) .",
    "otherwise , if it s desirable reprepare the state as soon as possible , then @xmath49 should be slightly bigger than @xmath8 , limiting the precision of @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , @xmath50 will be as stronger as @xmath51 needs .",
    "this it s a possible way to reprepare the states in situation 1 , indepently of their initial state itself .",
    "situation 2 is more complicated because far away of magnetic field which causes the distortion , we ca nt take advantage of properties of magnetic field which generates distortion . otherwise , it s improbable that observer could reproduce the original conditions in the two places that particles have been located now , so for this reason we can make just local operations to try to return the state to the original ( it means the use of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath52 ) .",
    "applying magnetic fields to each particle @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a time @xmath32 , and taking @xmath55 , @xmath56 :    @xmath57    we found that unfortunately there are not a single selection of @xmath58 to construct a time reversion operation , neither to reconstruct both states with exactly the same requirements ( so probably , the observer could to require make a measurement to try to know what state should reconstruct and select the best conditions ) .    for the best of scenarios we obtain as reprepared closest states to @xmath22 and @xmath21 ( dropping some unitary factors ) :    @xmath59    where :    @xmath60    one common condition to reconstruct both states ( and sufficient for @xmath22 ) as in ( [ reconstructedstates ] ) , it s just :    @xmath61    with @xmath62 .",
    "now , to reconstruct approximately @xmath21 as in ( [ reconstructedstates ] ) , observer requires in addition :    @xmath63    with @xmath64 .",
    "it s covenient that :    @xmath65    nevertheless not always it s possible ( fig .",
    "2 ) . additional attempts to reconstruct completely @xmath21 require to have control and freedom to select @xmath8 , but this is nt . in general , while sooner the process of reconstruction , the magnetic field needed for repreparation should be stronger and more inhomogeneous because of ( [ solsit2a ] ) and ( [ solsit2b ] ) . any way the conclusion is that fulfilling the conditions for reconstruct the second state we automatically fulfill the condition for the first state ,",
    "so the observer does nt require to take an intermediate measure .    particularly , when @xmath66 with @xmath67 , then @xmath68 giving a perfect reconstruction of the state ( note that altenatively if field is homogeneous , @xmath68 .",
    "but in addition is needed that :    @xmath69    which despite that can be fulfilled with sufficiently precision by a rational approximation : @xmath70 , is useless because the term @xmath71 in the expressions of state evolution ca nt be delimited because @xmath72 is inversely proportional to @xmath73 ( just if @xmath74 the last process become useful ) .",
    "now , instead of the last for situations 1 and 2 , we will assume that observer is interested in to make a program of control with a measurement intermediate in order to know what state was originally created and reconstruct it in the most accurate or convenient way .",
    "following to braczyk @xcite and xi @xcite , in this stage , some measurement should be made on each qubit in order to obtain some information about the actual state and so , to identify with certain probability which was the original created by the system . in a general procedure ,",
    "we need to define a povm as :    @xmath75    where : @xmath76 and @xmath77 are orthonormal states for each part .",
    "the helmstrom probabilities ( success probabilities ) are :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the states after of distortion arising from the original states @xmath22 , @xmath21 trough of the hamiltonian of interaction . with this ,",
    "the average fidelity becomes :    @xmath81    with @xmath82 , @xmath83 the states to reprepare after of measurement ( by example following the procedures delined in before section ) .",
    "note that in this scheme we do nt work with mixed states as in @xcite .",
    "so , our task is to find which are the best states :    @xmath84    to measure and reprepare the system in order to maximize the average fidelity .",
    "as an example , in a very intuitive approach we take :    @xmath85    last reprepared states cold be achieved with procedures delined in subsection a. how in our case @xmath86 , some calculations show that :    @xmath87    for comparison , we take the do - nothing scheme ( as is used in [ 1 , 2 ] , this is a scheme where we do nt make re - preparation and helmstrom probabilities are 1 ) and we obtain :    @xmath88    this fidelity does nt depend on the inhomogeneity of field but its strength @xmath89 .",
    "fidelity for both procedures is shown in figure 3 , as a function of parameters @xmath17 , @xmath89 .",
    "we note that first procedure is quit inefficient when @xmath90 ( with initial states very similar ) for different values for duration of interaction .      in general",
    ", our optimization problem is to take :    @xmath91    and to find the best parameters @xmath92 with an adequate selection of @xmath93 to maximize @xmath94 in ( [ fidelity ] ) .",
    "the last just in case that we agree take the most coventional way of mesurement , it means , take a measure on each part .",
    "other ways of measurment can be implemented taking measurements which involve both parts at the time .    in the case",
    "that we will reprepare the measured state upon the result with the original states ( @xcite and @xcite shown that this is not the optimal way to maximize @xmath94 ) the optimization problem becomes :    @xmath95    with @xmath96 as in ( [ helmstrom ] ) and @xmath92 as in ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "this optimization problem is in general difficult of solve because of large number of parameters .",
    "nevertheless for the case without magnetic field , it reduces to :    @xmath97    taking derivatives with respect to @xmath92 and solving the optimization problem , it conduces to 108 solutions giving the seven critical fidelities : @xmath98 . from these solutions , 8 solutions emerge with @xmath99 , which generate the two physically different set of measurements shown in table i , named a and b in the following .",
    "[ tabla1 ]    .the two solutions for povm ( [ measure ] ) which maximize @xmath99 in absence of magnetic field . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     of course , in this scheme states are not distorted after of ising interaction because their invariance @xcite .",
    "in addition , this scheme is limited to the absence of magnetic field , nevertheless it will be interesting analyzing how this set of measurements works by extension when magnetic field is present . applying povm type a or b of table i in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field and repreparating the system with the original states we obtain :    @xmath100    figure 3 shows the comparison between @xmath101 for an illustrative time of interaction and @xmath39 value .",
    "@xmath102 reduces when @xmath103 to the same value of @xmath104 :    @xmath105    which shows the oscillatory behavior of both procedures respect magnetic field strenght .",
    "similarly , when @xmath106 :    @xmath107    finally we can observe that :    @xmath108    in this sense , both procedures @xmath109 and @xmath102 are covering partially the control with fidelity at least of @xmath110 . for reference , we define in the following :    @xmath111      as was said , obtain @xmath112 analytically is actually difficult .",
    "nevertheless this problem could be solved numerically . taking a region @xmath113 \\times [ b_{+_{min}},b_{+_{max}}]$ ] for some @xmath8 and @xmath39 , we can to seek the best values for @xmath92 for each @xmath114 with some appropriate numerical algorithm .",
    "for the example depicted before , we obtain @xmath112 compared with @xmath115 shown in figure 3 .",
    "observe now the increased fidelity in around of 50% around of @xmath116 and slightly by 15% near of @xmath117 and @xmath118 . with this , around of 80% of this region",
    "have a fidelity up of 0.8 ( fig .",
    "in the last section was considered the case when distortion is applied with certainty after of the process for produce the states . nevertheless , if we have some stochastic component about this distortion , additional considerations appear . instead",
    "to follow braczyk @xcite and xi @xcite by considering the application of distortion with some probability ( which is more situable for dephasing noise or bit flipping noise ) , we will think in some normal distribution for the duration time of ising interaction around of @xmath119 with a dispersion @xmath41 :    @xmath120    with this , the states after of interaction are :    @xmath121    for @xmath13 , with : @xmath122 and @xmath123 given by ( [ initialstates ] ) and ( [ evolop ] ) respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath124 in order to take these integral limits .",
    "expressions for this last states are so large to include here ( specially @xmath125 ) , nevertheless they are analytically achieved .",
    "it s well known that operators :    @xmath126    are entanglement witnesses @xcite . applying this operators to @xmath127 we obtain that @xmath128 , except for :    @xmath129    expliciting that @xmath130 is an entangled state independently of values for @xmath89 and @xmath119 .",
    "note that they go to zero when @xmath131 .",
    "similarly for @xmath125 :    @xmath132    which for some selection of parameters @xmath133 and @xmath119 become all positive , it means that @xmath134 is a separable states in such case . particularly for @xmath135",
    "we will have entangled states if @xmath136 .",
    "now , helmstrom probabilities are calculated as :    @xmath137    and the fidelity is :    @xmath138    where @xmath139 are the reprepared states after of mesurement . reapeating calculations of the before section we obtain @xmath109 as in ( [ fdr1 ] ) because this fidelity was independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this is noticeable because for @xmath140 this is a very good fidelity and is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , an unknown hypotesis has been used here , the reprepared states are exactly the same that the original , which not always is possible , at least with the procedures developed in section iv .",
    "we will study this in following subsections .    for @xmath104",
    ", after of some calculations :    @xmath141    with :    @xmath142    this expression reduces to ( [ fn ] ) when @xmath143 and to @xmath144 when @xmath131 .",
    "last value is achieved when @xmath145 ( most distinguishable initial states and strong ising interaction respect to @xmath89 ) .    similar numerical procedures that those of before section could give us optimal control , but they depend on a lot parameters including @xmath41 .",
    "we will skip this study , instead , turn our attention in more basic but still effective control procedures .",
    "some aspects should be said related with restrictions of repreparation for the mixed states . before ,",
    "formula for average fidelity should be simplified in case that observer decides not take an intermediate measurement to make decisions about control scheme ( similarly as in the do - nothing scheme ) . in such case , it results from ( [ fidelitymix ] ) :    @xmath146    clearly more complications or diminishing of fidelity arise when @xmath147 , if repreparation is near of perfection .",
    "so , in our last study will suppose for simplicity that the observer does not need make a measure to adjust some parameters of repreparation ( as was in procedures of section iv ) , which is perfectly made for some @xmath8 but working over a mixed state given for uncertainty of this parameter , as was depicted in the before subsections .      in the situation 1 depicted in section iii ,",
    "repreparation begins at some time completely defined by the observer , still under the action of the original magnetic field but with partial ignorance of the begining of influence of it .",
    "for this reason , how the observer do nt have perfect control of time @xmath119 , although he has planned make a repreparation in terms of ( [ solsit1 ] ) for time @xmath148 not always will correct perfectly the state to the original because this uncertainty .",
    "so :    @xmath149    with with @xmath150 calculated as in ( [ mixedstate ] ) , @xmath151 given by ( [ evolsit1 ] ) and ( [ solsit1 ] ) , for all parameters of repreparation control , ( @xmath152 ) , calculated for @xmath148 .",
    "note that measurement it is nt necessary here because observer does nt need to know the initial state to correct it .",
    "( [ fidelitymixnomeasure ] ) is in this case :    @xmath153    with :    @xmath154    note that dependence on @xmath119 is just trough @xmath40 from ( [ solsit1 ] ) .",
    "this scheme of repreparation it s equivalent to the do - nothing scheme when @xmath155 and @xmath156 with @xmath67 , then @xmath157 matches with @xmath104 .",
    "some important properties are :    @xmath158    where the meaning of the inequalities is that with adequate selection of parameters this values are reached upmost .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath104 ( black ) togheter @xmath157 ( gray ) for @xmath159 as an example , for different values of @xmath160 depending of @xmath17 and @xmath41 ( here , @xmath161 were selected to give the positive values of @xmath162 closest to zero ) .",
    "we take @xmath163 $ ] as the maximum value for which ( [ normal ] ) remains valid .",
    "note that in general by increasing @xmath119 the fidelity goes down as a result of periodicity of phenomena reported in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the imprecision of repreparation in @xmath157 sometimes gives worst values that @xmath104 .",
    "in the situation 2 , after of interaction , distorted state remains unaltered in principle and observer could decide then to take a measurement to fit the best parameters for repreparation ( this is not strictly necessary if he decides to apply magnetic fields as it s required by the second state as in ( [ solsit2a ] ) and ( [ solsit2b ] ) , because authomatically condition for first state is fulfill ) .",
    "he has still some uncertainty about the real time @xmath119 of interaction . in this case :    @xmath164    with @xmath165 given by ( [ evolop ] ) but with @xmath52 as was depicted in the section iv.b .",
    "( [ fidelitymixnomeasure ] ) becomes for this case :    @xmath166    with :    @xmath167    where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the parameters in ( [ parameterssit1 ] ) with @xmath148 .",
    "it s noticeable that repreparation in terms of subsection iv.b it s equivalent to do - nothing scheme when @xmath170 and @xmath171 , in that situation ( [ fnmix ] ) and ( [ fmixsit1 ] ) match .",
    "some important properties are :    @xmath172    where the meaning of the inequalities is that with adequate selection of parameters this values are reached upmost .",
    "figure 5 shows complete comparison with the three last control schemes , exhibiting an aparent superiority of @xmath173 because its better repreparation .",
    "this is true at least for smaller values of @xmath119 , nevertheless for intermediate values there are a combination for superiority in patches .",
    "it s clear the decreasing fidelity for @xmath131 as is expected .      comparing our results for @xmath174 and @xmath173",
    "we note that all have the form :    @xmath175    and independently of @xmath17 , these expressions become equal to 1 just if :    @xmath176    in expressions of before subsections we find that @xmath177 is related with @xmath178 and @xmath41 showing a periodic behavior for the two first , but decreasing until one half ( @xmath179 ) for large values of @xmath41 .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in @xmath180 in relation with @xmath41 , but more centered in @xmath39 and @xmath119 parameters .",
    "finally , @xmath181 exhibits diverse dependence of the parameters , but invariably note that @xmath182 if @xmath131 , which is responsible of ( [ lim1infty ] ) and ( [ lim2infty ] ) .",
    "study of entangled pure states distorted by ising interaction doubted to parasite magnetic field shows that it s possible reach very good fidelities in the process of control .",
    "nevertheless these schemes assume that repreparation is completely faithful . with direct and simple schemes of control",
    "( applying extra magnetic fields on site or separating particles and then apply secondary magnetic fields ) just partial reconstruction could be reached , particularly for systems with @xmath31 .",
