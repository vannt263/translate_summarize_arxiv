    "the popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that elliptical galaxies found today in the cores of rich clusters formed at high redshifts and at rare high - density peaks of the dark matter distribution . within these regions ,",
    "gas - rich proto - galaxies merge together rapidly , forming stars at a high rate .",
    "the same reservoir of gas used to build the stellar mass can also fuel the growth of the supermassive black holes ( smbh ) found dormant in the centre of the galaxies at low redshift ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; page et al .",
    "2001 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ) . since massive star formation is known to be a dusty phenomenon , the optical light from many young galaxies should be highly obscured .",
    "dust enshrouded star formation is , however , a luminous phenomenon in the millimetre through far - infrared wavebands where the star - light absorbed by dust grains is re - emitted .",
    "indeed , in the last decade , deep surveys at submillimetre ( e.g. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; eales et al .",
    "1999 ; scott et al .",
    "2002 ; coppin et al . 2006 ) and millimetre ( e.g. greve et al . 2004",
    "; bertoldi et al . 2007 )",
    "wavelengths have identified a high - redshift population of massive , dusty galaxies that are undergoing extreme starbursts ( e.g. smail et al .",
    ". likewise , hotter dust heated in the circumnuclear environment of an agn will emit at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore , submillimetre and mid - infrared observations can be combined to study activity in forming galaxies due to dust obscured starbursts and agn .    to - date",
    "there has been no published survey at ( sub)millimetre or far - infrared wavelengths of a randomly selected region of sky over an area sufficiently large to ensure that very rare structures in the early universe are contained within it .",
    "although large surveys of this type will be available soon from instruments such as scuba-2 on the jcmt and spire / pacs on - board the _ herschel space observatory _ , published surveys have so far been limited to an area of @xmath9  deg@xmath10 ( coppin et al . 2006 ; austermann et al .",
    "2010 ; wei et al .",
    "one of the largest published submillimetre surveys is the scuba half - degree extragalactic survey ( shades ; mortier et al .",
    "2005 ; coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) which , due to technical problems , mapped only 0.2 deg@xmath4 discovering @xmath11 submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) . whilst this survey provided one of the largest and most uniformly selected samples of smgs ever assembled ,",
    "the area of sky surveyed is extremely small by most standards .",
    "for example , @xmath12cdm simulations predict that a dark matter halo of mass greater than a few times @xmath13  m@xmath14 at @xmath15 will evolve to become a very rich cluster of galaxies by @xmath16 ( e.g. farrah et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , since the surface density of such massive haloes at @xmath17 is only of order @xmath18  deg@xmath10 ( evrard et al .",
    "2002 ) , a wide - area survey would be required in order to contain one by chance",
    ".    one promising method of locating rare structures is to target the fields of high - redshift active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . given their huge luminosities , such objects must contain a smbh even at very high redshifts , and therefore must represent some of the most massive objects in existence at their epochs .",
    "they should thus act as signposts to rare high - density regions of the early universe , and can be observed efficiently with existing technology .",
    "several groups have exploited this technique to search for proto - clusters forming around high - redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. kurk et al .",
    "2000 ; pentericci et al .",
    "2000 ; ivison et al .",
    "2000 ; stevens et al . 2003 ; smail et al . 2003 ; de breuck et al .",
    "2004 ; greve et al . 2007 ; venemans et al . 2007 ) and quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ; stevens et al . 2004 ; priddey , ivison & isaak 2008 ) .",
    "most of these studies have concentrated on extreme objects , those with the highest luminosities and at the highest redshifts , and all have found over - densities of star - forming galaxies ( typically ly@xmath19 emitters or smgs ) in the fields of the agn . here",
    "we extend this work to investigate the environments of typical qsos at submillimetre and mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the qsos are selected over the redshift range @xmath0 where the star - formation rate density and accretion luminosity density of the universe peak .",
    "this work is motivated by the desire to study the coupled formation of stellar mass and black holes in galaxies that should evolve to become typical ellipticals in moderately rich clusters by the present day . since the bulk of the field smg population",
    "are also found at these redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) we can also compare the properties of galaxies found in different environments .",
    "this paper presents submillimetre and mid - infrared imaging data for 5 qso fields .",
    "we extract submillimetre catalogues and integral number counts , and compare these with results from blank field surveys .",
    "we then characterise the mid - infrared properties of the qsos and the smgs discovered in their fields .",

    "likely mid - infrared counterparts to the submillimetre galaxies are given in table  [ table : spit ] .",
    "for each field we searched within fixed radii of the extracted submillimetre positions .",
    "these radii of 5 arcsec at @xmath24 and @xmath25 m , and 10 arcsec at @xmath26 m were chosen to approximately match the theoretical error circles on the submillimetre positions added in quadrature with the uncertainty on the mid - infrared positions , which are significant at @xmath26 m ( see ivison et al .",
    "2007 for a full discussion ) .",
    "the corrected @xmath27 statistic ( downes et al . 1986 ) is given for each source found within the search radii .",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath28 $ ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the search radius , @xmath32 is the surface density of objects at the limiting flux density of the catalogue , @xmath33 is the surface density of objects brighter than @xmath34 where @xmath34 is the flux density of a potential counterpart galaxy located a distance , @xmath35 , away from the submillimetre position .    a value of @xmath36 is typically used as a threshold to select robust radio ids ( e.g. ivison et al . 2002 , 2007 ) to submillimetre galaxies .",
    "we select all mid - infrared sources found within our search radii as potential counterparts and use the @xmath27 statistic to distinguish between competing ids when more than one galaxy is found .",
    "we note that almost all smgs listed in table  [ table : spit ] have mid - infrared counterparts for which the computed @xmath27 value is @xmath37 in at least one waveband , and can therefore be considered robust based on this criterion .",

    "it is natural to speculate that an over - dense region of space at high redshift containing galaxies that are capable of building large , homogeneous populations of stars will evolve over cosmic time to become clusters of galaxies containing a population of massive elliptical galaxies . since it is well established that elliptical galaxies contain dormant smbhs ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , and that these must have assembled at high redshifts where the accretion luminosity density peaks , we expect that our smgs should contain growing black holes , i.e. agn .",
    "how the major growth phase of the black hole coincides temporally with the luminous starburst that builds up the stellar mass is a current topic of debate .",
    "indeed , models predict a range of possibilities ( e.g. archibald et al 2002 ; di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ) but there must be a link between the formation of the stars in the bulge and the smbh because of the tight correlation between their masses found for local galaxies ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . after a number of early null results using moderate depth x - ray data ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; waskett et al .",
    "2003 ) deep x - ray ( alexander et al . 2005a , b , 2008 ) and mid - infrared spectroscopy ( menndez - delmestre et al .",
    "2007 ; pope et al . 2008 ) observations show that smgs found in the field often do contain agn but that the masses of their black holes may be much smaller than those found in high redshift qsos , and consequently that the bulk of the far - infrared emission is due to the starburst .",
    "moreover , estimates of the host galaxy masses suggest that the growth of the black hole lags the growth of the spheroid ( borys et al . 2005 ; alexander et al .",
    "2008 ; see also coppin et al .",
    "2009 ) . while this may be the case for smgs , analysis of massive galaxies selected on other criteria find evidence to the contrary , suggesting that more than one scenario is possible for the formation of a massive galaxy and its smbh .",
    "for example , studies of powerful radio sources ( mclure et al .",
    "2006 ) and luminous qsos ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that the black - hole mass to bulge luminosity ratio increases towards high redshifts thus indicating that the black hole reaches its critical mass before the galaxy bulge is fully formed .",
    "the mid - infrared colours of our smgs also argue against the presence of a powerful agn in these objects unless they are very highly obscured .",
    "they are thus either intrinsically different objects to the qso or they are caught at a different time in their evolution .",
    "page et al .",
    "( 2010 , in prep . ) argue that the x - ray absorption in the qsos has its origin in an ionized absorber associated with a powerful wind capable of terminating the star formation .",
    "such feedback is a popular ingredient of models since it leads naturally to the relationship between smbh mass and spheroid mass discussed above ( e.g. fabian 1999 ) .",
    "if the smgs in the same field evolve to form a cluster of ellipticals then they would presumably go through a similar evolutionary sequence to the qso but are caught at an earlier stage of their life cycle at @xmath8 .",
    "estimates of the stellar masses would be useful to put further constraints on their evolutionary status .",
    "to this end we are currently fitting models to optical through infrared data to determine photometric redshifts and restframe @xmath357-band luminosities ; an analysis of the rxj  094144 field is currently in progress ( carrera et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . ) .",
    "one difference worthy of note between the findings of this paper and those for high - redshift ( typically @xmath358 ) radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) concerns very bright smgs in their fields .",
    "two of the seven hzrg fields imaged with scuba contain smgs with @xmath359 mjy ( stevens et al . 2003 ) whereas the brightest object found around the qsos has @xmath360  mjy .",
    "although the samples are too small to give a statistically significant result it appears that the smgs detected around the lower redshift , less powerful , radio - quiet agn have lower @xmath361 .",
    "a direct comparison is not informative because the sources were extracted with different signal - to - noise criteria and by different methods but comparing flux densities significantly above the catalogue cut - offs yields @xmath342 smgs with @xmath362  mjy in the 7 hzrg fields while only @xmath363 are detected around the 5 qsos .",
    "given the effectively flat relationship between @xmath361 and redshift for @xmath364 this difference in flux density leads to a proportional difference in star - formation rates ( all other things being equal ) .",
    "there is thus reasonably good evidence for a difference in star - formation activity in individual galaxies in these fields indicating that the galaxy formation process might be dependent on the magnitude of the density peak and/or its redshift .",
    "for example , in the case of hzrgs it was found that the detection rate increased dramatically at @xmath365 ( archibald et al .",
    "2001 ; reuland et al .",
    "2004 ) which is significantly higher than the average redshift of our qso sample .",
    "another possibility is that the radio properties of the central agn are in some way linked to environmental density ( e.g. kauffmann , heckman & best 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , recent work by falder et al .",
    "( 2010 ) finds evidence for larger over - densities of galaxies around radio - loud objects ( based on work carried out at 3.6  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "perhaps radio synchrotron luminosity is enhanced in regions where the inter - galactic medium is more dense .",
    "an obvious next step will be to conduct a statistically meaningful survey of fields around agn over the full range of redshifts in order to track star - formation activity as a function of cosmic time .",
    "the next generation bolometer camera on the jcmt ( scuba-2 ) and spire / pacs on - board the _ herschel space observatory _ are instruments with good enough sensitivity to make such a campaign practical .",
    "it would also allow a bigger area to be mapped around each agn , better matching the size of proto - cluster regions predicted by numerical simulations .",

    "<S> robust mid - infrared counterparts are identified for all four submillimetre detected qsos and @xmath7 per cent of the smgs . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - infrared colours of the qsos are similar to those of the local ulirg / agn mrk  231 if placed at @xmath8 whilst most of the smgs have colours very similar to those of the local ulirg arp  220 at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> mid - infrared diagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the smgs host buried agn although we can not rule out such a possibility . </S>",
    "<S> taken together our results suggest that the qsos sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoing an enhanced level of major star - formation activity , and should evolve to become similarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find evidence that the level of star - formation activity in individual galaxies appears to be lower around the qsos than it is around more powerful radio - loud agn at higher redshifts .    </S>",
