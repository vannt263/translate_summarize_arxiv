    "convex sobolev inequalities such as poincar and logarithmic sobolev inequalities play an important role in the analysis of the convergence to stationarity for markov processes .",
    "besides implying exponential decay of the entropy , it is known that these functional inequalities give useful concentration bounds @xcite and hypercontractivity of the corresponding semigroup @xcite , and they are a natural tool to estimate mixing times @xcite .",
    "there exists an extensive literature on the derivation of poincar inequalities ( or spectral gap estimates ) and logarithmic sobolev ( or shorter : log - sobolev ) inequalities in the discrete and continuous setting ; see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite and the books @xcite .",
    "an algorithm for the computation of the spectral gap is presented in @xcite , while corresponding estimates can be found in @xcite . for log - sobolev inequalities ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "there are much less results on beckner inequalities for markov chains , which interpolate between the poincar inequality and log - sobolev inequality @xcite .",
    "such inequalities are of interest , for instance , in the large - time analysis of markov chains using general entropies or in numerical analysis , proving the exponential decay of solutions to discretized partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "we are only aware of the paper by bobkov and tetali @xcite , where estimates on the constant of the beckner inequality were derived for bernoulli - laplace and random transposition models . in this paper",
    ", we establish new bounds for discrete convex sobolev and beckner inequalities for stochastic processes not studied in @xcite .",
    "the technique of proof is the bochner - bakry - emery method of caputo et al.@xcite , which was recently extended by fathi and maas in @xcite in the context of ricci curvature bounds .",
    "the idea of the bakry - emery approach is to relate the second time derivative of the entropy to its entropy production .",
    "this relation is achieved by employing a discrete bochner - type equation which replaces the bochner identity in the continuous case .    in order to make these ideas precise , consider a time - homogeneous markov process @xmath0 with values in a finite state space @xmath1 , having an invariant measure @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the semigroup @xmath3 , defined on @xmath4 by @xmath5 $ ] , is strongly right continuous , so that the infinitesimal generator @xmath6 exists , @xmath7 . given a probability measure @xmath8 on @xmath1 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the distribution of @xmath10 assuming that @xmath11 is distributed according to @xmath8 .",
    "the rate of convergence of @xmath9 to the invariant measure @xmath2 is a major topic in probability theory .",
    "it can be achieved by estimating the time derivative of the relative entropy .    before explaining the entropy decay , we introduce some notation . the relative entropy @xmath12 of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath2 is defined by @xmath13      = \\sum_{\\eta\\in s}\\pi(\\eta)\\phi\\left(\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\pi}\\right)(\\eta),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a smooth convex function such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 is concave , @xmath17 , and @xmath12 is meant to be infinite whenever @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",

    "then @xmath38 solves the kolmogorov equation @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "furthermore , integration over @xmath47 leads to @xmath48 if we know that @xmath49 as @xmath50 . on the one hand , this implies exponential convergence of the relative entropy to zero , i.e. , @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "is equivalent to the _ convex sobolev inequality _",
    "valid for all probability densities @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that if the so - called curvature - dimension condition @xmath53 is satisfied , then the convex sobolev inequality is valid ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.16 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath6 is the generator of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , @xmath53 holds with @xmath54 under the conditions that @xmath55 is convex and @xmath16 is concave @xcite . in the discrete case , the validity of",

    ", we derive general conditions on @xmath55 that guarantee the validity of .",
    "for the special cases @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we obtain the _ modified log - sobolev inequality _ and _ poincar inequality _ , respectively , @xmath57 note that if @xmath6 is the generator of a reversible diffusion process , we may write @xmath58 , so the log - sobolev inequality @xmath59 and the first inequality in coincide with @xmath60 .",
    "this is generally not true for markov processes with jumps @xcite , but for reversible processes , the relations @xmath61 hold @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine conditions under which there exists a constant @xmath43 such that the ( discrete ) convex sobolev inequality and the exponential entropy decay @xmath62 hold .",

    "according to the above discussion , inequalities - are achieved by proving , and the proof of this inequality is based on a discrete bochner - type identity . the idea to employ such an identity was first presented in @xcite , elaborated later in @xcite , and goes back to @xcite .",
    "the identity is obtained by identifying the radon - nikodym derivative of a measure involving the jump rates of the markov chain ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) .",
    "this allows one to relate terms with different orders of `` discrete derivatives '' occuring in @xmath6 . for details ,",
    "we refer to section [ sec.boch ] .",
    "our technique of proving is completely different from the work @xcite , where an iteration method was used to derive discrete beckner inequalities .",
    "fathi and maas @xcite extended the results of caputo et al . @xcite .",
    "the key idea of @xcite ( and , by the way , of @xcite ) is the use of the logarithmic mean @xmath71 in the analysis .",
    "the logarithmic mean allows for the discrete chain rule @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , which naturally holds in the continuous case .",
    "this chain rule is needed to treat the logarithmic entropy . in the case of general convex entropies , it is natural to replace the logarithmic mean by @xmath74 which satisfies the discrete chain rule @xmath75 since @xmath76 `` approximates '' @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 , we obtain the power mean @xmath79 we remark that the idea to enforce a discrete chain rule is well known in the design of structure - preserving numerical schemes and was used , e.g. , in the construction of entropy - conservative finite - volume fluxes @xcite and in the discrete variational derivative method @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this paper is the identification of the conditions on @xmath55 that are needed to apply the technique of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , besides convexity of @xmath55 and the concavity of @xmath16 , the concavity of @xmath80 is needed .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath81 is a discrete approximation of @xmath16 , and the concavity of @xmath16 is assumed in the continuous case .",
    "conditions on @xmath55 that guarantee the concavity of @xmath82 are stated in lemma [ lem.phi1 ] . both the logarithmic mean and the power mean satisfy these conditions ; see lemma [ lem.theta1 ] .",
    "the general theory can be applied to birth - death processes , thus yielding new discrete convex sobolev inequalities . for other stochastic processes considered in this paper ( zero - range processes , bernoulli - laplace models , random transposition models ) ,",
    "a homogeneity property of @xmath82 is needed , which restricts the class of admissible functions @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that the logarithmic mean and the power mean satisfy this property ; see lemma [ lem.theta1 ] . for the mentioned processes ,",
    "new discrete beckner inequalities are derived .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we detail the bochner - bakry - emery method in section [ sec.boch ] .",
    "the validity of the discrete beckner inequality is reduced to the validity of a modification of . in section [ sec.ex ] ,",
    "we apply the general technique to four stochastic processes ( as in @xcite ) : birth - death processes , zero - range processes , bernoulli - laplace models , and random transposition models .",
    "furthermore , the results for birth - death processes are applied to a finite - volume discretization of a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation , yielding exponential decay of the discrete entropy .",
    "the proof consists of a combination of the convex sobolev inequality for birth - death processes and the results of mielke @xcite , who proved exponential decay for the logarithmic entropy .",
    "our main conclusion is that the bochner - bakry - emery approach is sufficiently flexible to be applicable to power functions and , in certain cases , to general convex functions .",
