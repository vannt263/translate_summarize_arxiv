    "large amount of radiation emitted by astrophysical objects like microquasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) favours the scenario that such energy output is due to the conversion of gravitational energy of matter into heat and radiation as it falls into extremely relativistic objects like black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "microquasars are essentially x - ray binaries and are supposed to harbour a stellar mass bh ( @xmath4 ) , while agns harbour supermassive bh   @xmath5 .",
    "the radiation emitted by these objects in general contains a relatively low energy multi - coloured blackbody component and one or more power - law components in the higher energy limit .",
    "when the accretion disc is in a state , from which the power emitted maximizes in the higher energy region and the luminosity is low , it is called the low / hard ( lh ) state .",
    "when the power maximizes in the lower energy level , the disc is luminous and produces multi - coloured blackbody radiation , it is called the high / soft state ( hs ) .",
    "there are many intermediate states ( i m ) which connects the two . along with energetic photons , agns and microquasars also eject highly energetic , collimated and relativistic bipolar jets .",
    "observations of a large number of microquasars showed that the jets are seen only when the accretion is in the lh or i m , but the jet is not seen when the accretion disc is in canonical hs spectral state @xcite , the jet states are correlated with the spectral states of the accretion disc .",
    "such a correlation between spectral states and jet states can not be made in agns , partly , because of the longer timescale associated with supermassive bhs and partly , due to possible lack of the periodic repetitions of the outer boundary condition of agn accretion discs .",
    "however , the fact that timescales in agns and microquasars can be scaled by mass @xcite tells us that the essential physics around super - massive and stellar mass bhs are similar .    the first popular model of accretion disc around bh was proposed by @xcite and @xcite , and is known as keplerian disc or standard disc or sakura - sunyaev ( ss ) disc .",
    "it is characterized by matter rotating with local keplerian angular velocity , with negligible infall velocity , and is geometrically thin but optically thick .",
    "being optically thick , each annuli emits radiation which is thermalized with the matter .",
    "each annulus has different temperature and therefore the spectrum emitted is a sum of all the blackbody radiations from each of the annuli , multi - coloured blackbody spectrum .",
    "indeed , the thermal radiation part of a bh candidate spectrum is well explained by a keplerian disc .",
    "although ss disc was very successful in explaining the thermal component of the spectrum emitted by bh candidates , but it could not explain the hard powerlaw tail .",
    "the inner boundary condition of the ss disc is quite arbitrary and is chopped off within the marginally stable orbit .",
    "the pressure gradient term and the advection term in ss disc are also poorly treated .",
    "it was realized that there should atleast be another component in the disc , which would behave like a comptonizing cloud of hot electrons to produce the hard power - law tail @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inner boundary condition of bh dictates that matter crosses its horizon with the speed of light , and that the angular momentum of the flow close to the horizon needs to be necessarily sub - keplerian .",
    "therefore , in addition to ss discs , investigations of accretion in sub - keplerian regime also gained prominence , such as thick accretion discs @xcite , advection - dominated accretion flows or adaf @xcite , advective - transonic regime @xcite .",
    "all these models start with exactly the same set of equations of motion i.e. , navier - stokes equation in strong gravity , but differ in boundary conditions .",
    "for example , if the radial advection term and the pressure gradient term are negligible , azimuthal shear is responsible for viscosity and the heat dissipated due to viscosity is thermalized locally and efficiently radiated out , then the resulting disc is the ss disc . on the other hand ,",
    "if only the advection term is negligible and the cooling is less efficient , then the model is thick disc .",
    "the adaf and the transonic regime are not subjected to such confinement , infact , @xcite showed that global adaf is indeed a subset of general transonic solutions .",
    "recently , by playing around with the viscosity parameter and cooling efficiency in the computational domain , @xcite were able to generate both sub - keplerian advective disc and keplerian disc simultaneously .",
    "the keplerian disc gives out soft photons , and sub - keplerian flow supplies hot electrons , if the disc has a shock transition .",
    "the post - shock disc behaves like a comptonizing cloud , and produces the hard power - law photons .",
    "the transonic / advective disc has several advantages .",
    "it satisfies the inner boundary condition of the bh , i. e. , matter crosses the horizon at the speed of light and therefore it is supersonic and sub - keplerian .",
    "it implies that the existence of a single sonic point ( the position where bulk velocity crosses the local sound speed ) is guaranteed around a bh .",
    "however , depending on the angular momentum , there can be multiple sonic points . as a consequence ,",
    "matter accelerated through the outer sonic point can be slowed down due to the presence of centrifugal barrier .",
    "this slowed down matter may impede the supersonic matter following it , and may cause shock transition @xcite .",
    "shock in bh accretion has been found to exist for inviscid flow @xcite , dissipative flow @xcite , and has also been confirmed in simulations @xcite .",
    "the post - shock region of the disc ( psd ) , has some special properties .",
    "apart from producing hard powerlaw photons , it was shown for an inviscid disc via numerical simulations , that the extra thermal gradient force in the psd powers bipolar jets @xcite , and was later established for viscous disc as well @xcite . moreover , since the jet originates from psd ( which extends from few to few tens of schwarzschild radii ) and not the entire disc , it satisfies the observational criteria that jets are generated from the inner part of the accretion disc @xcite .    most of the theoretical studies of accretion on to bhs have been in the domain of pseudo - newtonian potential ( pnp ) @xcite and fixed adiabatic index ( @xmath6 ) equation of state ( eos ) of the flow .",
    "using pnp gravity potential instead of the newtonian one has the advantage that , the keplerian angular momentum distribution , the location of marginally stable orbit ( @xmath7 ) , marginally bound orbit ( @xmath8 ) , or , the photon orbit ( @xmath9 ) can be obtained exactly , as is obtained in general relativity ( gr ) , but can still remain in the newtonian regime of physics .",
    "however , according to relativity , matter can not achieve the speed of light ( @xmath10 ) outside the horizon , but , in pnp regime matter velocity exceed @xmath10 outside the horizon .",
    "the effective potential of a rotating particle is zero on the horizon in gr , however , it is negative infinity on the horizon if we use pnp .",
    "moreover , in relativity the physics of fluid is different from that of the particles .",
    "this arises because in relativistic equations of motions the thermal term , the angular momentum term etc , couples with the gravity .",
    "as a result , for conservative systems , the constants of motion are not the same in particles and fluids . while in pnp regime , the constants of motion in fluid and particles are identical . for viscous flow ,",
    "the shear tensor in relativity is much more complicated and contains many more terms when compared to the shear tensor in pnp regime .",
    "therefore , solutions of relativistic equations for transonic accretion discs around bh have been few ( for * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when compared with those in pnp regime and that too in the inviscid limit .",
    "the first consistent viscous advective accretion solution in pure gr was obtained by @xcite .",
    "they derived the shear tensor from the first principle , and then approximated it with a simpler but accurate function .",
    "for inviscid flow the constants of motions are the relativistic bernoulli parameter ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the enthalpy and @xmath13 is the covariant time component of the four velocity ) , the accretion rate , angular momentum and the entropy along a streamline . for viscous flow , except the accretion rate ,",
    "none of these are constant along the motion , and constants of motion need to be determined .",
    "the information of the constants of motion were not used at all by @xcite , which resulted in a limited class of solutions .",
    "moreover , they did not discuss the issue of massloss either .",
    "we would like to rectify that , i. e. , to say we would like to obtain all possible accretion solutions using constants of motion and constants of integration , as well as , estimate the mass loss from the accretion solution .",
    "another limitation of a large body of work on accretion - ejection solutions around compact objects is that , most of the work has been done assuming a fixed @xmath6 equation of state ( eos ) , where , @xmath6 is the adiabatic index . from classical fluid mechanics , we know that @xmath6 is the ratio of specific heats , which turns out to be equal to the constant @xmath14 , if random motions of the constituent particles of the gas are negligible compared to @xmath10 .",
    "however , if the random speeds of the particles is comparable to @xmath10 , then @xmath6 is not constant and the eos becomes a combination of modified bessel s function of the inverse of temperature @xcite .",
    "it can be trivially shown that the different forms of the exact eos obtained by the above three authors are equivalent @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that it is unphysical to use fixed @xmath6 eos when the temperature changes by a few orders of magnitude @xcite . the first accretion solution using a relativistic eos on to a schwarzschild bh",
    "was obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite regenerated the solutions of peitz and appl , but also obtained solutions with another form of viscosity using variable @xmath6 eos in kerr - schild metric .",
    "however , the eos used was again for a fluid composed of similar particles .",
    "fluids around bh should be fully ionized given the temperature associated with these fluids , and ionized single species fluid can only be electron - positron flow which can not exist for thousands of schwarzschild radii around the bh .",
    "@xcite however , hinted how to describe a fluid composed of different particles .",
    "@xcite in a seminal paper solved accretion solutions in the advective domain for electron - proton flow , and predicted the possibility of accretion shocks around bh .",
    "the inherent problem of using the exact relativistic eos in simulation codes is that , it is a ratio of modified bessels function which make transformation between primitive variables and state variables non - trivial . to circumvent this problem we obtained an approximate eos which is very accurate @xcite for single species fluid , and then extended it to multi - species fluid @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic eos was also obtained for such a flow by integrating the entropy generation equation without source terms @xcite .",
    "the comparison of chattopadhyay - ryu ( cr ) eos with an exact one showed negligible difference between the two @xcite .",
    "the approximate cr eos was also used in the pnp regime to study dissipative accretion flow @xcite , which showed that accretion shocks may exist for very high viscosity , as well as , high accretion rates . moreover , depending on these flow parameters such discs can be of low luminosity , as well as , can emit above the eddington limit .",
    "interesting as it may be , but we know pnp regime can only be considered to be qualitatively correct , and a general relativistic viscous disc should be considered to fully understand the behaviour of such discs .",
    "investigations of general relativistic , dissipative , advective accretion discs around bh , described by relativistic eos has not been done for multi - species eos , in addition , estimation of mass loss from such disc has not been undertaken as well .",
    "apart from the highly non - linear equations of motion in gr to contend with , it is also a fact that in curved space time , the constant angular momentum surfaces are special surfaces called von - zeipel surfaces ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "jets launched with some angular momentum would follow these surfaces .",
    "so an accretion - ejection system in gr is significantly different from pursuing the same study in pnp regime . in this paper , we obtain a simultaneous , self - consistent bipolar jet solution from a general relativistic viscous disc around a bh , described by multi - species relativistic eos .    in the next section , we present the equations of motion for the accretion disc and the jet , and also a brief description of the eos used . in section [ sec : solproc ] , we present the solution procedure of the equations of motions . in section [ sec : result ] , we present the results , and then present our concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusn ] .",
    "in this section , we first present the equations of motion governing the accretion disc and then those governing the matter leaving the disc as bipolar jets .",
    "although equations of motion for both disc and jets are conservation of four - momentum and four - mass flux , but since the flow geometry of the disc and that of the jet are different , we will separately present the two sets of equations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , a cartoon diagram of the disc jet system is presented .",
    "the accretion disc occupies the region around the equatorial plane , while the jet flows about the axis of symmetry .",
    "the jet geometry is significantly different from the pnp prescription and will be described in section [ subsec : ouequatn ] .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for the viscous flow is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the local energy density , local gas pressure and four - velocities , respectively .",
    "the inverse of the metric tensor components is @xmath19 and greek indices @xmath20 represent the space - time coordinates . here , @xmath21 is viscous stress tensor and considering it is only the shear that gives rise to the viscosity , then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the viscosity coefficient .",

    "this would on one hand simplify the equations tremendously , and on the other hand would allow us to directly compare with the plethora of work done with pseudo potentials @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 component of the shear tensor ( equation [ shear1.eq ] ) is written as @xcite @xmath45 following @xcite , we neglect derivatives of @xmath46 and @xmath47 and equation ( [ rphic.eq ] ) becomes @xmath48 in this paper , we consider only the simplest bh metric for the accretion disc , namely the schwarzschild metric , in which the non - zero metric components are @xmath49 for accretion , the flow is around the equatorial plane ; therefore , the equations are obtained at @xmath50 and assumed hydrostatic equilibrium along the transverse direction . with these assumptions ,",

    "it is indeed intriguing to note that @xmath82 also has the same dimension of @xmath86 ,   of specific energy , but the former is a constant of motion while @xmath86 is not .",
    "it must be noted that @xmath86 incorporates the information of motion locally ,   motion along radial and azimuthal direction ( quasi - one - dimensional ) , and the effect of gravity through @xmath87 , while the information of internal energy is through @xmath12 .",

    "the reduction of steady shock parameter space due to mass - loss actually indicates that shock in accretion actually exists in a wide range , but only as a time - dependent one .",
    "investigations of viscous accretion disc around a bh in general relativistic regime are important , because a bh is necessarily a relativistic object , and close to the horizon the departure from newtonian description is significant .",
    "analysis with paczyskii - wiita pnp gives us an overall qualitative understanding , but quantitatively the results or predictions based on pnp are bound to be wrong .",
    "one of the artefacts of pnp is that the disc closer to the horizon is hotter than they actually are .",
    "moreover , matter speed exceeds the speed of light .",
    "furthermore , the relativistic shear tensor is more complicated than the newtonian variant .",
    "all these reasons influenced us to re - investigate the self - consistent , simultaneous , viscous accretion - ejection solutions around bhs in the general relativistic regime .",
    "we chose the simplest type of bh for our study , simply because the influence of kerr metric in powering jets is not very conclusive in some of the studies made on microquasars @xcite .    in this paper , we first analysed only the accretion solution (  assuming @xmath360 ) .",
    "the solution procedure was influenced by the methodology laid down by becker and his collaborators in the pnp regime in order to find the sonic points self - consistently .",
    "we have generalized it for general relativistic domain .",
    "moreover , the equation of the state of flow is also relativistic and not a newtonian polytropic gas , as was used by becker .",
    "we obtained all possible accretion solutions in the advective domain , starting from bondi type ( single @xmath227-type sonic point ) , solutions where multiple sonic points formed , shocked solution and adaf solutions ( single @xmath226-type sonic points ) .",
    "all of these various solutions were obtained for various combinations of @xmath361 , so in this respect each solution is a three - parameter class of solutions .",
    "a quick comparison shows that , in the pnp regime shocks are stable for higher viscosity parameters ( @xmath362 ) , but in the general relativistic regime ( solutions of this paper ) shock remains steady for much lower values ( @xmath363 ) . in the pnp regime ,",
    "the shear tensor is much simpler , and the @xmath44 component is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity @xcite , but in the gr regime the shear tensor is much more complicated and depends on four - velocities and their derivatives , as well as various components of four - acceleration .",
    "the approximated version used in this paper also has radial four - velocity term in addition to the derivative of azimuthal component of four - velocity ( see equation [ rphi.eq ] ) . as a result",
    ", the shock is made unstable for lower values of @xmath286 .",
    "instability of shock is actually good because not only such oscillation explains quasi - preiodic oscillaitons ( qpos ) but also does additional pumping to generate stronger jet @xcite .    in this paper , we did a detailed study of jet morphology based on the works of ( * ? ? ? * and citations therein ) . here too , physics in curved space - time differed from newtonian or pnp regime . in gr , the entropy constant surface in non - equatorial plane for adiabatic flow coincides with constant angular momentum surfaces called vzs which are not cylinders of flat space - time .",
    "@xcite showed ways to relate these surfaces with angular momentum of the flow . since jets are tenuous and are likely to be adiabatic till they interact with the ambient medium , so adiabatic jet is a fairly good assumption .",
    "therefore , vzs becomes the natural streamline of the flow .",
    "interestingly , the accreting matter has predominantly the radial and azimuthal component of four - velocity , and can be quite accurately described about the equatorial plane ; however , the jet has all three components of the four - velocity .",
    "we turned this essentially three spatial dimensional problem into an effective one - dimensional problem , by projecting jet equations of motion along the streamline defined by vzs and the methodology is properly defined in section [ subsec : ouequatn ] and appendix [ app : gpp ] .",
    "the streamline obtained in such a manner is very rich , where some combination of parameters produced partially pinched - off streamlines , which are ripe case for multiple sonic points and internal shocks in jets .",
    "however , in schwarzschild geometry above the equatorial plane , such jet geometry can not be connected to the inner disc region of the accreting matter .",
    "only those vzs solutions which did not allow multiple sonic points were found to be relevant , and therefore we only obtained monotonic jet solutions .",
    "so depending on where the shock in accretion disc forms , the jet base and jet flow geometry change .",
    "this fact is also markedly different from pnp prescription , since in pnp prescription the jet geometry is weakly dependent on the jet base or other accretion disc properties .    the response of the shock location with viscosity is similar to our studies in pnp .",
    "even relativistic viscosity makes the accretion shock to move closer to the event horizon as it is increased , if the outer boundary condition of the accretion disc is kept the same .",
    "as the shock moves closer to the bh , compression ratio across the shock increases , which generally increases the jet strength .",
    "this initially increases the relative mass outflow rate , but the mass outflow rate starts to drop , as the shock moves closer to the bh .",
    "we also showed that as the shock becomes stronger ( forms closer to the bh ) , it also increases the upward thrust ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig11]d , [ fig : fig13]b ) .",
    "independent of how much percentage of accreting matter is pumped out as jets , because of the increased thrust the terminal speed of the jet material increases with decreasing shock location .",
    "the shock can not move too close to the bh and still remain stationary , at some point it will become unstable and start to oscillate . and",
    "that is marked by the closest limit up to which we found steady shocks in this analysis .",
    "although this investigation is steady state and can not conclusively comment on essentially time - dependent phenomena , but it can be conjectured that increasing viscosity even more should increase the oscillation frequency of the shock too .",
    "such a situation does mimic an outbursting source , where it had been shown that as the object moves from low hard state to intermediate states , the qpo as well as the jet strength increases .",
    "we also showed that fluid described by a proton proportion of @xmath364 of the electron number density ( the rest being positrons ) , or @xmath365 is thermally the most relativistic , and can form shocks in accretion in the largest portion of the @xmath354 parameter space .",
    "we also showed that shock in accretion does not form if the accretion disc is composed of pair plasma .",
    "and the mass outflow rate is less than @xmath3 of the accretion rate for any value of @xmath218 .",
    "we also showed that independent of the composition of the flow , hotter the accretion disc , faster will be the emanating jet , although the mass outflow rate may not be very high .",
