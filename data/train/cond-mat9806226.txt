    "solutions containing polyelectrolytes remain an outstanding challenge to physical - chemistry . due to the long - ranged nature of the coulomb force",
    "our understanding of this class of polymers is still quite rudimentary .",
    "this situation can be compared to the one that existed in electrochemistry of the turn of the century , before debye and hckel ( dh ) presented their , now famous , theory of strong electrolytes @xcite .",
    "the fundamental question that must be addressed by any successful theory of polyelectrolytes concerns with the role played by the counterions . in this respect ,",
    "the traditional theories of liquid state are not of great help , since most of the approaches based on resolution of integral equations come to a dead - end when the numerical schemes used to tackle these difficult problems fail to converge .",
    "the scaling theories , which have been so successful in elucidating the properties of nonionic polymers @xcite have , so far , proven futile in the face of large number of length scales relevant for polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "what seems to be lacking is a mean - field theory of polyelectrolytes similar to the one created by debye and hckel for simple electrolytes , and flory for non - ionic polymers . in our previous work",
    "we have attempted to construct such a mean - field theory for one special class of polymer solutions , the rigid polyelectrolytes @xcite .",
    "the constraint of rigidity allowed us to study the effects of electrostatic interactions decoupled from that of conformational structure of polyions .",
    "the theory has proven to be successful in elucidating various thermodynamic properties of rigid polyelectrolytes in the presence , or in the absence , of monovalent salt . in this letter",
    "we shall present a theory of rigid polyelectrolyte and ionic - surfactant solutions .",
    "the interaction between polymers and surfactants is of great practical importance in areas as diverse as colloidal stabilization , polymer solubilization , mineral flotation and flocculation , as well as various aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry @xcite . in many practical applications",
    "the polymers are dissolved in some sort of polar solvent , typically water , leading to monomer ionization .",
    "this situation is very common for biological systems .",
    "for example , in an aqueous solution , the phosphate groups of a dna molecule become ionized , giving it a net negative charge .",
    "similarly the phospholipids , which compose the cell membrane , in aqueous environment acquire a net negative charge .",
    "the repulsion between the like - charged molecules makes the introduction of a polynucleotide sequence into a cell a formidable challenge to molecular biologists .",
    "it has been observed , however , that in the case of binding by ionic surfactant dissolved in a polyelectrolyte solution , the adsorption isotherms show a striking degree of cooperativity .",
    "this surprising phenomenon suggests that ionic surfactants or ionic lipids can be used as a  packaging \" in order to deliver polynucleotides into living cells .",
    "indeed , some recent experiments demonstrate that the cationic lipid reagents provide some of the best methods available for the gene delivery systems @xcite .",
    "the solution under consideration consists of anionic polyions , monovalent salt , and cationic surfactant , inside a volume @xmath0 ( see fig.@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is important to remember that the overall system is charge neutral , what implies that the negative charge of polyions and the positive charge of surfactants is counterbalanced by an appropriate number of counterions ( univalent cations ) , and coions ( univalent anions ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the analysis we shall assume that all of the counterions are identical , whether they are derived from polyions or from disassociation of monovalent salt .",
    "a similar approximation will be made in the case of coions .    in order to study the interaction between an ionic surfactant and a polyelectrolyte we resort to the simplest possible model .",
    "the rigid polyions , of density @xmath2 , are represented by cylinders of length @xmath3 and diameter @xmath4 .",
    "each polyion has a charge @xmath5 , uniformly distributed along the length of the cylinder .",
    "the spacing between each charged group is @xmath6 .",
    "the cationic surfactants , of density @xmath7 , are modeled as flexible chains of @xmath8 monomers each , with the head group carrying a charge @xmath9 .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that each monomer is a sphere of diameter @xmath10 .",
    "the density of counterions ( cations ) is @xmath11 , while the density of coions ( anions ) is @xmath12 .",
    "both the coions and the counterions will be modeled as hard spheres of diameter @xmath10 and charge @xmath13 located at their centers .",
    "the solvent ( water ) will be represented by a uniform medium of dielectric constant @xmath14 .",
