    "throughout this paper , we consider a unique server addressing two parallel queues numbered @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "incoming jobs enter either queue and require random service times ; the server then processes jobs according to the so - called shortest queue first ( sqf ) policy",
    ". specifically , let @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) denote the workload in queue @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "queue @xmath52 ) at a given time , including the remaining amount of work of the job possibly in service ; the server then proceeds as follows :    * queue @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "queue @xmath52 ) is served if @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( resp . if @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ; * if only one of the queues is empty , the non empty queue is served ;",
    "* if both queues are empty , the server remains idle until the next job arrival .",
    "in contrast to fixed priority disciplines where the server favors queues in some predefined order remaining unchanged in time ( e.g. , classical preemptive or non - preemptive head - of - line priority schemes ) , the sqf policy enables the server to dynamically serve queues according to their current state .",
    "the performance analysis of such a queueing discipline is motivated by the so - called sqf packet scheduling policy recently proposed to improve the quality of internet access on high speed communication links . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", sqf policy is designed to serve the shortest queue , i.e. , the queue with the least number of waiting packets ; in case of buffer overflow , packets are dropped from the longest queue .",
    "thanks to this simple policy , the scheduler consequently prioritizes constant bit rate flows associated with delay - sensitive applications such as voice and audio / video streaming with intrinsic rate constraints ; priority is thus implicitly given to smooth flows over data traffic associated with bulk transfers that sense network bandwidth by filling buffers and sending packets in bursts .",
    "in this paper , we consider the fluid version of the sqf discipline . instead of packets ( i.e. , individual jobs )",
    ", we deal with the workload ( i.e. , the amount of fluid in each queue ) . since the fluid sqf policy considers the shortest queue in volume , that is , in terms of workload , its performance is quantitatively described by the variations of variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we here suppose that the buffer capacity for both queues @xmath51 and @xmath52 is infinite .",
    "moreover , we assume that incoming jobs enter either queue according to a poisson process ; in view of the above application context , one can argue that such poisson arrivals can model traffic where sources have peak rates significantly higher than that of the output link ; such processes can hardly represent , however , the traffic variations of locally constant bit rate flows .",
    "this poisson assumption , although limited in this respect , is nevertheless envisaged here in view of its mathematical tractability and as a first step towards the consideration of more complicated arrival patterns .",
    "the above framework enables us to define the pair @xmath13 representing the workloads in the stationary regime in each queue as a continuous - state markov process in @xmath14 . in the following , we determine the probability distribution of the couple @xmath13 by studying its laplace transform .",
    "the problem can then essentially be formulated as follows .",
    "[ prob1 ] given the domain @xmath15 and analytic functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in @xmath21 , determine two bivariate laplace transforms @xmath22 , @xmath23 and two univariate laplace transforms @xmath24 , @xmath25 , analytic in @xmath21 and such that equations @xmath26 for some analytic function @xmath27 , together hold for in @xmath28 .",
    "note that each condition @xmath29 or @xmath30 with @xmath31 brings the latter equations respectively to @xmath32    to the best knowledge of the authors , the mathematical analysis of the sqf policy has not been addressed in the queueing literature .",
    "some comparable queueing disciplines have nevertheless been studied :    * the _ longest queue first _ ( lqf )",
    "symmetric policy is considered in @xcite , where the author studies the stationary distribution of the number of waiting jobs @xmath33 , @xmath34 in each queue ; reducing the analysis to a boundary value problem on the unit circle , an integral formula is provided for the generating function of the pair @xmath35 ; * the _ join the shortest 2-server queue _ ( jsq ) , where an arriving customer joins the shortest queue if the number of waiting jobs in queues are unequal , is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the bivariate generating function for the number of waiting jobs is then determined as a meromorphic function in the whole complex plane , whose associated poles and residues are calculated recursively .",
    "while the above quoted studies address the stationary distribution of the number of jobs in each queue , we here consider the real - valued process @xmath13 of workload components whose stationary analysis requires the definition of its infinitesimal generator on the relevant functional space .",
    "besides , the laplace transform of the distribution of @xmath13 proves to be meromorphic not on the entire complex plane , but on the plane cut along some algebraic singularities ( while the solution for jsq exhibits polar singularities only ) ; as a both quantitative and qualitative consequence , the decay rate of the stationary distribution at infinity for sqf may change according to the system load from that defined by the smallest polar singularity to that defined by the smallest algebraic singularity .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ ma ] , a markovian analysis provides the basic equations for the stationary distribution of the coupled queues ; the functional equations verified by the relevant laplace transforms are further derived in section [ ltd ] . in section [ expi ] , we specialize the discussion to the so - called symmetric exponential case where arrival rates are identical , and where service distribution are both exponential with identical mean ; the functional equations are then specified and shown to involve a key cubic equation . specifically ,",
    "* problem [ prob1 ] * for the symmetric case is shown to reduce to the following .",
    "[ prob2 ] solve the functional equation @xmath36 for function @xmath1 , where given functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to one branch of a key cubic polynomial equation @xmath37 .",
    "for real @xmath38 , the solution @xmath39 is written in terms of a series involving all iterates @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the analytic extension of solution @xmath42 to some domain of the complex plane is further studied in section [ sqfqueue ] ; this enables us to derive the empty queue probability along with the tail behavior of the workload distribution in each queue for the symmetric case .",
    "the latter is then compared to that of the associated preemptive head of line ( hol ) policy .",
    "concluding remarks are finally presented in section  [ cl ] .",
    "the proofs for basic functional equations as well as some technical results are deferred to the appendix for better readability .",
