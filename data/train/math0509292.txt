    "empirical evidence suggests that every acute isosceles triangle with base angle at least 54 degrees admits an orbit of period 10 resembling ( 1,4 ) .",
    "thus we ask : to what extent do the results above generalize to acute isosceles triangles ?",
    "\\(3 ) arbitrarily label the sides of the triangle @xmath304 and consider the sequence of integers modulo 3 given by the successive bounces of a billiards trajectory .",
    "clearly periodic trajectories yield periodic sequences .",
    "for example , the sequence @xmath305 is given by the period 4 orbit ( 1,1 ) . if @xmath306 is a periodic mod 3 sequence , is @xmath306 given by some billiards trajectory ?",
    "this project emerged from an undergraduate research seminar directed by zhoude shao and the second author during the spring of 2003 .",
    "student participants included john gemmer , sean laverty , ryan shenck , stephen weaver , and the first author . to assist us computationally , stephen weaver created his orbit tracer  software @xcite , which generated copious experimental data and produced the diagrams in figure 10 above .",
    "dennis deturck suggested we consider the general billiards problem and consulted with us on several occasions .",
    "numerous persons read the manuscript and offered helpful suggestions at various stages of its development .",

    "we thank each of these individuals for their contributions .",
