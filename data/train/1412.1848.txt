    "in the newtonian theory of gravity , it is well - known the procedure to deal with a given surface of discontinuity .",
    "one should simply impose the continuity of the gravitational potential across it and the discontinuity of the gravitational field comes from its surface mass .",
    "such boundary conditions can be easily concluded from the ( linear ) field equation , given the precise notion of reference systems .",
    "nevertheless , in general relativity the problem is much more involved , due to the nonlinearity of the field equations and the principle of general covariance @xcite . for the elucidation of the problem and references , see refs .",
    "@xcite . the solution to this problem consists of imposing specific boundary conditions to the induced metric tensor and the extrinsic curvature @xcite on a hypersurface splitting spacetimes in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "such a procedure is generically called either the thin - shell formalism or the darmois - israel formalism .",
    "it has been applied to a variety of scenarios , assessing the physical properties of e.g.  dynamic thin - layers @xcite , quantum fields in thin - shell spacetimes @xcite , wormholes @xcite , and radiating spheres @xcite .",
    "it was already shown that such a formalism is equivalent to searching for distributional solutions to einstein s equations @xcite . for details about the derivation of the hypersurface conditions in this scenario , see ref .",
    ".    the thin - shell formalism would be meaningful for stars that are expected to display interfacial layers much smaller than their characteristic sizes @xcite , endowed generically with nontrivial quantities , such as surface tensions and surface energy densities .",
    "some systems of our interest in this line can be , for example , compact stars with interfaces separating their cores and their crusts , e.g.  strange quark stars and neutron stars .",
    "we highlight that the darmois - israel formalism gives the nontrivial properties of transitional layers fully taking into account general relativity , but just under the macroscopic point of view .",
    "more generally , the thin - shell formalism would be the proper formalism for approaching any gravitational system that presents discontinuous behaviors in their physical parameters .",
    "we consider here a star with different phases as the match of given spacetimes split by hypersurfaces that could possess nontrivial properties , which in turn lead to nontrivial dynamics , imputable to general relativity .",
    "the dynamics of a shell does not imply compression or dilution of the matter contents in the spacetimes , since it is induced by fixed geometries associated with its adjacent spacetimes .",
    "when a shell moves , one phase ( thick layer ) tends to `` swallow '' the other , leading the shell to `` absorb '' degrees of freedom to it @xcite , in order to compensate the changes of the energy - momentum in the adjacent phases and on itself .",
    "all of these aspects shall be clarified subsequently .    duly taking into account surface degrees of freedom in a stratified astrophysical system",
    "is of cardinal importance because they guarantee that the global spacetime represented by the union of the spacetime solutions matched at given interfaces is also a solution of the general relativistic equations .",
    "the consistency of the match of spacetimes is far from trivial owing to the intrinsic non - linearity of the einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "our aim in this article is to analyze , within the thin - shell formalism , the stability of transitional / interfacial thin layers present in compact stars against radial displacements of the shell .",
    "these latter perturbations are the outcome of surface ones only .",
    "they are assumed to occur adiabatically and therefore will propagate with the speed of the sound @xcite , to be properly inspected for these continuous systems . in order to evidence the intrinsic role that the surface degrees of freedom ( surfaces tensions and surface energy - densities ) play in stars with discontinuities",
    ", we shall work in the context where just surface perturbations are present .",
    "this analysis is believed to be important since instabilities of interfaces in compact stars ( triggered by physical mechanisms we shall not investigate ) might be a direct sign of instabilities of the whole systems , even in the absence of perturbations in the glued spacetimes .",
    "besides , it would pave the way for stability analyses where the phases of the system are also perturbed .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ overview ]",
    "we introduce the general equations of the thin - shell formalism , while in section  [ interpretation ] we make a physical interpretation of the shell s parameters leading to a general relativistic extension of the concepts of surface energy - density , surface tension , and the young - laplace equation of the mechanical equilibrium of phase - separating interfaces .",
    "the equation of motion of the thin - shell and the condition for the shell s stability are derived in section  [ sec : stability ] .",
    "the consequences of the treatment for the case of constant - pressure phase - transitions are outlined in section  [ constpress ] .",
    "we present in section  [ numerical ] the application of the formalism to the simplest case of stars made of incompressible matter and to the case of strange quark stars with crust .",
    "section  [ slowrot ] shows the extension of the thin - shell treatment of an interface in the case of slow rotation .",
    "finally , in section  [ disc ] we outline and discuss the main conclusions of the article .",
    "we use geometric units @xmath0 throughout the article . unless it is not otherwise stated , we work with a signature @xmath1 .",
    "greek indexes run from zero to three , while latin ones run from zero to two .",
    "the darmois - israel formalism can be enunciated as follows @xcite .",
    "consider two pseudo - riemannian manifolds , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , endowed with metric fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with respect to two independent coordinate systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "assume that such manifolds have boundaries @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if such boundaries are identified , then a natural match of manifolds can be done , where the resultant manifold , @xmath10 , is the union of the aforementioned ones .",
    "call such a common hypersurface as @xmath11 .",
    "assume that a coordinate system @xmath12 is adapted to it .",
    "as any hypersurface , it represents a constraint of the spacetime coordinates , here defined as @xmath13 .",
    "it can also be written in the parametric form @xmath14 .",
    "a natural basis can be defined on @xmath11 by means of tangent vectors to its coordinate curves .",
    "define the components of it as @xmath15 .",
    "with these basis vectors , one can easily find the induced metric on @xmath11 , @xmath16 , when the spacetime line element is constraint to such a hypersurface . from our previous reasoning , it is clear that such an induced geometry must be unique . indeed , this is the first boundary conditions one has to impose in order to have a well - defined pseudo - riemannian manifold made out of the glue of two other ones .",
    "this can be viewed as the general relativistic generalization of the continuity of the gravitational potential across a surface in the newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "the geometry of @xmath11 is @xmath17 which is independent of the coordinate systems @xmath18 utilized .",
    "the normal unit four - vector to @xmath11 is defined such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 and it is tacit that @xmath21 is actually a shortcut to @xmath18 . besides , @xmath22 , depending on the nature of the hypersurface .",
    "notice that the case where @xmath23 is null is not contemplated here .",
    "equation ( [ normal ] ) also guarantees that @xmath24 .",
    "another important quantity for characterizing a hypersurface is its extrinsic curvature ( or second fundamental form ) @xmath25 where we did not put the `` @xmath26 '' labels just not to overload the notation .",
    "one sees that the extrinsic curvature components are the tetrad decomposition of the tensor @xmath27 , thence a tangent vector @xcite .",
    "let us define the jump of a given tensorial quantity across @xmath11 as @xmath28^+_-\\doteq a(x^{+})|_{\\sigma}-a(x^{-})|_{\\sigma}$ ] .",
    "it is implicit in the previous definition that @xmath29 stands for a given quantity @xmath30 being evaluated in arbitrary points belonging to the disjoint regions implied by @xmath11 and then taken the limit when they tend to an arbitrary point on @xmath11 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor on @xmath11 coming from general relativity that guarantees a distributional solution to the field equation , @xmath31 , can be expressed in terms of the jump of the extrinsic curvature by means of the lanczos equation @xcite @xmath32^+_- - h_{ij}[k]^+_-)\\label{lanczos},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "this is the second boundary conditions one should impose . clearly , it is the ( manifestly covariant ) generalization of the jump the gravitational field experiences in the newtonian theory .",
    "note that @xmath31 also contributes to the energy - momentum tensor of the matched manifold as @xmath34 , @xmath35 the dirac delta , and this is essential to guarantee the validity of the bianchi identities for @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "we shall see that this is indeed the case . besides , @xmath58 is the work done by the nonzero normal flux of momentum @xmath59 across @xmath11 .",
    "we would like also to emphasize that the thin - shell formalism in the spherically symmetric case leads to eqs .",

    "such an equation of state would embrace the microphysics of the matter inside the shell .",
    "otherwise , a free parameter will be present into the formalism .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above equations are general in the spherically symmetric case and can be applied to configurations with any energy - momentum tensor consistent with such an assumption .",

    "however , the energy - momentum tensor of the hypersurface holds still the perfect - fluid form ( [ sab ] ) since the pressure anisotropy exists only in the radial direction , dimension which is suppressed by definition in the thin - shell treatment of an interface .",
    "in this section we interpret the quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 arising from the thin - shell formalism for the spherically symmetric case . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the physical reason for having stability even for a shell embedded in vacuum spacetimes is due to the induced gravitational surface tension , as it can be seen from eq .",

    "we turn now to show a first immediate consequence of the thin - shell formalism : an astrophysical body with an interface splitting two phases under a constant pressure is stable against radial displacements whenever the mass the interfacial shell nests is much smaller than the total mass of the system .",

    "therefore , we have generically shown that the interface of a system separating a constant pressure phase - transition with negligible interfacial mass is always stable against radial perturbations .",
    "this result is therefore applicable to the stars with constant pressure phase - transitions , either in the scope of the maxwell or gibbs phase - transition constructions .",
    "it is important to recall , however , that in systems with more than one conserved charges ( e.g. baryon and electric ) the gibbs construction leads to the appearance of mixed phases , in between of the pure phases , with an equilibrium pressure that varies with the density .",
    "this may lead , in turn , to a spatially extended phase - transition of non - negligible thickness with respect to the star radius ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear that such an extended mixed phase region , separating the two pure phases , can not be treated within a thin - shell approach",
    ". nevertheless , its interfaces demarcating the onset and the termination of a mixed phase always can , as well as thin mixed phases . for the aforementioned constructions , in a sense the thin - shell treatment is more suitable to model configurations in which the phase - transition follows a maxwell construction , where the phases are in `` contact '' each other .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these treatments of the existing phases in compact stars subject the system to the condition of local charge neutrality , and so they do not account for the possible presence of interior coulomb fields .",
    "indeed , the complete equilibrium of the multicomponent fluid in the cores of compact stars needs the presence of an electric charge separation caused by gravito - polarization effects @xcite , favoring a sharp core - crust transition that ensures the global , but not the local , charge neutrality @xcite . in order to keep the presentation of the applications apropos of the thin - shell scenario as simple as possible , we consider hereafter the configurations in the limit where the system is locally neutrality , leaving the more complex case of global charge neutrality to be treated elsewhere .",
    "in order to gain more intuition about the main aspects of the thin - shell formalism , it is instructive to work first with an exact fully relativistic case . in this regard",
    "we analyze in this section the stability of stars with constant densities that present `` phase transitions '' .",

    "it has been suggested ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that strange stars not need to be necessarily bare cores as the ones just described but , instead , they can support , above the electronic layer , a crust of ordinary matter similar to outer crust of neutron stars . therefore , owing to the very small size of the transition interface between the strange matter core and the crust in a strange star , we can analyze it within the thin - shell formalism and assess its stability .    in order to have some insights about this interesting case , we start our analyses with its simplest microscopic quark matter model , the mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "such a model assumes that quarks constitutes a free fermi gas inside a `` bag '' whose width is related to the value of the energy - density at which the pressure vanishes , i.e. , the vacuum energy - density . in the limit of vanishing strange quark mass , @xmath154 ,",
    "the equation of state reduces to the simple linear expression @xcite : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the bag constant . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall adopt , without loss of generality , @xmath157 .",
    "the precise value of the bag constant does not change the main qualitative conclusions to be drawn here .",
    "we are interested here in investigating whether or not it is possible for the strange star to have a crust on top of its core s surface ( with zero quark pressure ) .",
    "the density of the crust at the edge with the electronic layer has to be necessarily lower than the neutron - drip value , @xmath158  g  @xmath140 , since having zero electric charge , any free neutron created in the crust would flow to the core where it would be converted into strange matter .",
    "for the crust matter , we use the baym - pethick - sutherland equation of state @xcite .",
    "we solved the einstein s equations ( [ g11equ])([derg00 ] ) for the above described equation of state , for selected values of the central density and different densities at the base of the crust , which we denoted to as @xmath159 , in each case .",
    "then , we seek for values of the parameter @xmath92 that satisfy the stability condition ( [ stabcond ] ) of the shell s effective potential .",
    "our numerical results show that thin - shells splitting the quark phases from crusts are always unstable for densities at the base of the crust of the order of the neutron drip density . in fig .",
    "[ vmin ] one can indeed verify that a quark star would be stable just if its density at the base of the crust was some hundred times the neutron drip one , which is clearly not permissible in the strange star hypothesis recalled above .",
    "the previous result suggests us that strange stars should just have a tiny a crust cloaking the quark s core surface .",
    "therefore , we should seek for solutions where the quark core would be matched directly with the schwarzschild exterior spacetime , hence treating the crust itself as part of the thin - shell .",
    "we recall that the quark stars we are analyzing here have at their core s edge null pressures and @xmath160 . for this case and matching with schwarzschild s solutions , we already know from section  [ constpress ] that the associated thin - shells are stable , irrespective of the fluids they host . physically speaking this result means that extremely thin crusts could always be taken as parts of thin - shells .",

    "there is no change in the parameters of the shell . as we commented formerly , this is already accounted since the corrections imprinted by the rotation to the shell parameters must be independent of its direction of rotation .",
    "nevertheless , up to first order of correction on the rotational parameters @xmath197 , a frame dragging effect is present , whose associated angular velocity gives a direct information about the surface energy - momentum tensor parameters .",
    "we shall elaborate upon these issues in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in the scope of the thin - shell formalism applied to stars , we have showed that whenever one considers phase transitions at constant pressures and with a negligible masses on the surfaces splitting them , the latter ones are always stable .",
    "this is relevant for commonly implemented phase transitions based on either the maxwell or gibbs constructions , since this would justify their use within the thin - shell formalism . in this case",
    "the degrees of freedom on the surface of discontinuity present in the dynamic case would always lead to stable configurations .",
    "our analyses also show that only tiny crusts , associated with thin shells , could envelop on the surfaces of quark stars ( at zero pressure ) .",
    "nevertheless , whenever the match between the core and the crust is not done at the strange star s surface ( where the quark pressure is null ) , it is always possible for the system to harbor thick crusts .",
    "this is so due to the steep increase of the quark pressure inwards , which would always allow a stable glue of the core with a crust at a radial position where their pressures equal , as we have showed previously .    when perturbations in the phases are also present , in principle they would also be dependent upon the surface degrees of freedom by means of additional boundary conditions to be taken for the stability problem , to be properly defined , what would also change the set of eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "this will be investigated in a forthcoming publication . at this first approach ,",
    "the aforementioned subtleties were not taken into account and we restricted ourselves to finding constraints where the surface perturbative analyses give a definite answer to the stability .",
    "this is due to the fact that the scenario where the phases are not perturbed evidences directly the consequences of the dynamics of the degrees of freedom of a shell , giving us thence insights for more elaborate analyses .",
    "concerning second and higher ( even ) order corrections to the rotational parameters of the shell in the stability analyses , a more detailed study is in order , to be attained elsewhere .",
    "such a case could be relevant to assess the stability of millisecond pulsars .",
    "for the first order corrections to the rotational parameters , just frame - dragging effects are of relevance .",
    "if they were measured , then one could obtain a direct information of the shell parameters , that could shed some light into the issues raised in this work .",
    "in addition to the simple example of quark matter analyzed in this work , there is the possibility of inducing conformal degrees of freedom into the transition hypersurface .",
    "this would be the case of the transition from hadronic ( quark - confined ) matter to color superconducting ( color - flavor - locked , cfl ) deconfined quark matter phase @xcite , or in the case of the quantum hall state between cfl and the hadronic phases @xcite . these systems lead to trace - free surface energy - momentum tensors , which in the spherically symmetric case imply @xmath217 [ see eq .",

    "detailed stability analyses can be then done also in these cases once the phases associated with the transition hypersurface are given ) ] , that are always present in continuous systems , were not taken into account there ] .",
    "the location of the hypersurface clearly depends on the precise knowledge of the equation of state of the different phases .",
    "for instance , the transition cfl - hadronic hypersurface is located at a smaller radius with respect to the one considered here for the core - crust transition in a strange star , since the former transition occurs at higher matter densities . based on our results of section [ constpress ]",
    ", we can conclude that , also in those more complex stratified stars , the stability of the hypersurfaces is guaranteed whenever the transition takes place at constant pressure .",
    "this is in contrast with the impossibility of having stable thin - shells in other context of linear thin - shell equations of state in the spherically symmetric case @xcite .",
    "this can be also derived from eqs .",
    "( [ evolequ ] ) , ( [ delta ] ) [ with @xmath218 , ( [ shelldyn ] ) and ( [ effpot ] ) .",
    "a very thought - provoking case that is possible to be analyzed in the darmois - israel formalism is the one where the surface energy - density satisfies @xmath219 . if this is valid , irrespective of its magnitude , then the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ stabcond ] ) should be reversed .",
    "such a case would in principle render stable unstable configurations for the case @xmath88 . in this line , and in view of the very short distance scales involved in the interfaces , it is tempting to state that quantum - mechanical effects such as the casimir one could be of some relevance there .",
    "indeed , a simple calculation ( using the expression for the energy - density to the casimir effect for two concentric spheres , see e.g.  @xcite ) , shows that its energy - density is of the same order of magnitude as the coulomb energy for a shell as the one present in the strange stars .",
    "this is an interesting issue that deserves to be better scrutinized .",
    "since there are good reasons for stars being stratified , surfaces degrees of freedom on surfaces of discontinuity could play a role there .",
    "it is then necessary to search for their observational fingerprints . in this regard",
    ", the `` glitches '' observed in pulsars could be a sign of the stratification of a system and deserve a closer look in light of the results presented in this work .",
    "the precession of the particle s orbits around a compact star could also give us information about surface / interface quantities , for instance related to the presence of a thin crust cloaking the core .",
    "the connection of this with the observed quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) for instance in low x - ray binaries @xcite could be particularly relevant ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
