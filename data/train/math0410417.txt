    "our objective in this paper is to study dynamics in @xmath0 in two situations : holomorphic fixed point germs @xmath2 at the origin and polynomial maps @xmath3 at infinity .",
    "we shall refer to these two cases as _ local _ and _ affine _ , with a fixed algebraic embedding into @xmath4 .",
    "the local case applies to a ( classical ) neighborhood of any smooth point on a surface . ]",
    "and we are interested in how fast orbits approach the origin and infinity , respectively .    in the affine case",
    "we can measure the rate of attraction to infinity by the algebraic degree @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , for `` most '' points @xmath6 near infinity we have @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath8 exists . , see  @xcite .",
    "] however , it is not obvious in what sense that orbits are actually attracted at the rate  @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , in the local case , we define @xmath10 as the smallest degree of any term in the taylor expansion of @xmath2 in local coordinates .",
    "thus @xmath11 for `` most '' @xmath6 near the origin .",
    "again , the existence of the limit @xmath12 is easy to establish , but its dynamical significance is less clear .    to avoid trivialities , all maps considered will be _ dominant _ , i.e.  their jacobian determinants do not vanish identically .",
    "we are also mainly interested in superattracting behavior , so we shall assume throughout that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "our aim is then to answer two questions .",
    "first , what numbers @xmath9 and @xmath15 may appear , and what can be said about the convergence of @xmath16 and @xmath17 to @xmath9 and @xmath15 , respectively ?",
    "second , in what sense are orbits actually attracted to infinity ( the origin ) at the rate @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) ?",
    "the next two theorems provide answers in the local case .    for any dominant fixed point germ @xmath18 ,",
    "the asymptotic attraction rate @xmath19 is a quadratic integer , i.e.  there exist integers @xmath20 , @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , there exists @xmath23 $ ] such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "our proof also goes through for formal fixed points germs ( defined by formal power series ) .",
    "the bound on @xmath26 allows us to improve upon theorem  a from  @xcite ( see the remark after that theorem ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is a dominant fixed point germ with @xmath27 , then there exists a plurisubharmonic function @xmath28 defined near the origin and a constant @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and such that @xmath31 decreases to a plurisubharmonic function @xmath32 with @xmath33 .    in particular",
    ", for any point @xmath6 outside a pluripolar set , we have @xmath34 for all @xmath25 and some constants @xmath35 . of course",
    ", not every orbit must converge to the origin at the rate @xmath15 and @xmath2 may even contract some curves .",
    "hubbard and papadopol  @xcite also studied superattracting fixed point germs , but their objective was different from ours : for the mappings they considered , @xmath36 and the existence of @xmath37 is easier to establish .",
    "the corresponding results in the affine case are as follows .    for any dominant polynomial map @xmath38",
    ", the asymptotic attraction rate @xmath39 is a quadratic integer .",
    "moreover , if @xmath13 , then either there exists @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for all @xmath25 ; or there exists a change of coordinates by a polynomial automorphism of @xmath0 such that @xmath3 becomes a skew product , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 for some @xmath44 .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is a dominant polynomial map with @xmath45 and not conjugate to a skew product .",
    "then there exist @xmath29 and a plurisubharmonic function @xmath46 on @xmath0 , such that @xmath47 near infinity , and such that @xmath48 decreases to a plurisubharmonic function @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the positive closed current @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 .",
    "skew products were considered in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  6 ) .",
    "the construction of an invariant current for rational maps is due to sibony  @xcite in the `` algebraically stable '' case , when @xmath53 for all @xmath25 .",
    "this was later extended to birational surface maps in  @xcite , and to special non - invertible rational maps in  @xcite .",
    "all these constructions are based on a precise understanding on the growth of degrees ; the same is true here .",
    "the set @xmath54 above is not pluripolar in general and points in @xmath54 may converge to infinity at a speed different from @xmath9 : see  @xcite for interesting ( algebraically stable ) examples .",
    "let us now explain our approach to the main results above .",
    "we first focus on the local case where the ideas are less involved .",
    "a common approach to study dynamic behavior is to find coordinates in which the mapping has a particularly simple expression  a _ normal form_. in one dimension , a very simple normal form is provided by boettcher s theorem ( see  @xcite ) : there exists a local coordinate near the origin such that the map becomes @xmath55 for some @xmath56 .",
    "as noted by hubbard and papadopol , the naive generalization of boettcher s theorem fails in higher dimensions .",
    "for instance , @xmath57 can not be conjugated to @xmath58 . indeed ,",
    "the critical set @xmath59 is totally invariant for @xmath60 , but @xmath61 is not totally invariant for @xmath2 .",
    "for this example , the analysis by hubbard and papadopol ( see also  @xcite for the affine case ) provides a conjugacy between @xmath2 and @xmath60 on a subset of @xmath0 , but that relies on much stronger ( hyperbolicity ) assumptions on @xmath2 than we wish to impose .    instead , we take inspiration from singularity theory and allow ourselves to work with birational changes of coordinates and with slightly more general normal forms .",
    "let us call a fixed point germ _ rigid _ if the critical set is contained in a totally invariant set with normal crossings singularities .",
    "thus @xmath60 above is rigid while @xmath2 is not .",
    "rigid ( contracting ) germs were introduced and classified in  @xcite .",
    "there are seven classes of them , each containing a simple normal form .",
    "the concept of a rigid germ is a dynamic version of simple normal crossings singularities for curves .",
    "the next theorem , which we shall refer to as _ rigidification _ , can thus be viewed as an analogue of embedded resolution of plane curve singularities . by a _ modification _",
    "we shall mean a composition of point blowups above the origin .",
    "a ( closed ) point on the exceptional divisor is called an _ infinitely near point_.    for any dominant fixed point germ @xmath18 with @xmath27 , there exists a modification @xmath62 and an infinitely near point @xmath63 such that the lift @xmath64 is holomorphic at @xmath6 , @xmath65 , and the fixed point germ @xmath66 is rigid .",
    "if we allow ourselves to use _ different _ modifications at the source and target spaces , we can make any map holomorphic and locally _ monomial _ in suitable coordinates , see  @xcite and proposition  [ p - monomap ] below .",
    "although this fact is not a direct consequence of hironaka s desingularization theorem , it is considerably simpler to establish than theorem  c , and serves as an important ingredient in the proof of the latter .",
    "we now indicate how theorem  c can be used to prove theorems  a and  b. one can show that @xmath67 is controlled by the speed at which orbits at @xmath6 under the lift @xmath68 approach the exceptional divisor @xmath69 . in view of the classification of rigid germs , this speed is either an integer or the spectral radius of a @xmath70 matrix with integer coefficients , hence a quadratic integer .    the construction of the function @xmath28 with @xmath71 in theorem  b requires a separate argument , but once we have found @xmath28 , the fact that @xmath72 can be established by showing that at least one orbit of @xmath68 can not approach @xmath69 too fast .",
    "so how , then , could one prove rigidification as in theorem  c ?",
    "when resolving curve singularities , the modification @xmath62 can be found inductively by successively blowing up points where we do not have normal crossings .",
    "the main problem then becomes proving that the inductive procedure terminates : this is done by showing that the curves involved always become less singular in the sense that a certain discrete numerical invariant decreases .",
    "to prove rigidification , such an approach seems difficult to carry out successfully .",
    "instead we take a different tack : we consider a space parameterizing _ all _ possible modifications at the same time , study the dynamics induced by @xmath2 on this space , and deduce dynamical information about @xmath2 itself .    to explain this strategy ,",
    "note that any irreducible component @xmath73 of the exceptional divisor of a modification defines a _ divisorial valuation _ on the ring @xmath74 of holomorphic germs at the origin : the value on a germ is the order of vanishing along @xmath73 of its pullback .",
    "it is possible to define a natural induced action of @xmath2 on the space @xmath75 of divisorial valuations .",
    "however , this space has a lack of completeness which makes it hard to properly analyze the induced action .    instead , we consider a larger space @xmath76 consisting of _ all _ valuations on @xmath74 ( centered at the origin , and suitably normalized ) .",
    "this space is automatically compact for the topology of the weak convergence , and we showed in  @xcite that @xmath76 admits a natural _ tree structure_. roughly speaking , @xmath76 is a collection of real line segments welded together in such a way that no cycles appear .",
    "more precisely , @xmath76 is an @xmath1-tree for a natural metric and possesses strong self - similarity properties .",
    "the line segments are made up of monomial valuations in suitable coordinates at infinitely near points above the origin , and are related to the farey blowups studied in  @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath75 above is a subset of @xmath76 in essentially the same way as @xmath77 is a subset of the ( compactified ) real line . in the sequel",
    ", we refer to @xmath76 as the _ valuative tree_.    the valuative tree can be used to efficiently encode local information near the origin in @xmath0 .",
    "we used it to study singularities of curves and ideals in  @xcite , of plurisubharmonic functions in  @xcite , and multiplier ideals in  @xcite .    here",
    "we prove that any dominant fixed point germ @xmath2 induces a natural selfmap @xmath78 , and that this selfmap respects the tree structure in a strong sense .",
    "for topological reasons , @xmath79 must then admit a fixed point , or _",
    "eigenvaluation_. we show that this eigenvaluation admits a basin of attraction @xmath80 , which can be chosen to be of a special type @xmath81 corresponding to an infinitely near point @xmath6 as follows .",
    "fix a modification @xmath62 such that @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 is the set of all valuations whose center on @xmath84 is @xmath6 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath81 under @xmath79 translates into the lift @xmath68 of @xmath2 being holomorphic at @xmath6 with @xmath65 . by choosing the basin carefully ,",
    "we can even make @xmath68 rigid at @xmath6 , leading to theorem  c.    the induced selfmap @xmath79 of @xmath76 seems to have quite strong global attracting features , similar to holomorphic selfmaps of the unit disk in @xmath85 .",
    "there are also close connections to @xmath6-adic dynamics , more precisely to the study of rational maps on @xmath86 ( see  @xcite ) .    in the affine setting , i.e.  when proving theorems  a and  b , the main idea is the same as in the local case , and consists of studying the action of @xmath3 on the set @xmath87 of ( normalized ) valuations on @xmath88 $ ] centered at infinity .",
    "however , in the same way that the study of plane affine curves has a quite different flavor than the theory of germs of analytic curves , the affine case proves to be more delicate than the local case .",
    "let us indicate two difficulties that we need to overcome .",
    "first , a dominant polynomial map of @xmath0 need not be proper , so the line at infinity is not invariant .",
    "in particular , the pushforward of a valuation centered at infinity may no longer be centered at infinity . as a consequence ,",
    "the induced selfmap of @xmath87 is not everywhere defined .",
    "second ( and more importantly ) , a valuation is by its very nature a local object and measures behavior at an infinitely near point .",
    "but for theorem  a we need to control degrees , which has a more global flavor .",
    "as it turns out , we can address both difficulties by working with a suitable subtree @xmath89 of @xmath87 . on this tree ,",
    "the relation between local and global information is well behaved .",
    "moreover , any dominant polynomial map acts on this tree in a way that preserves the tree structure . in particular",
    ", there is again an eigenvaluation , and this provides us with a starting point for the proofs of theorems  a and  b. the case when @xmath3 can be conjugated to a skew product arises exactly when the eigenvaluation is an end of the tree of a special type : it is associated to a pencil of rational curves having one place at infinity .",
    "the line embedding theorem  @xcite then provides the conjugacy .",
    "the space @xmath89 is the key new idea in the affine case . roughly speaking , a valuation is in @xmath89 if it takes negative values on any polynomial as well as on the form @xmath90 on @xmath0 . to our knowledge ,",
    "such valuations have not previously been systematically studied .",
    "a crucial property that they enjoy is that they are dominated by affine curves with one place at infinity . while such curves have received much attention in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , our focus on valuations made it difficult to extract the information that we needed .",
    "we therefore explore the structure on @xmath89 in an appendix , using key polynomials as in  @xcite , a technique originating with maclane  @xcite and subsequently developed by abhyankar - moh  @xcite under the name approximate roots .",
    "the paper is divided into eight sections . in the first one , we briefly recall the structure of the valuative tree as described in  @xcite . in the next five sections",
    ", we only deal with the local case , leaving affine problems for section  [ sec - affine ] .",
    "we thus fix a fixed point germ @xmath2 . in section  [ sec - actsingle ] ,",
    "we describe how @xmath2 maps one valuation to another .",
    "we then investigate the action of @xmath2 ( without iteration ) on the valuative tree in section  [ sec - acttree ] , and show that it preserves  in a strong sense  the tree structure .",
    "section  [ sec - fixed ] is devoted to the existence of an eigenvaluation and the second part of theorem  a. in section  [ sec - normal ] , we construct basins of attraction , deduce a stronger version of theorem  c , and exhibit normal forms of the lift @xmath2 at the point where it is rigid .",
    "this enables us to complete the proof of theorem  a. finally , section  [ sec - green ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  b , which relies heavily on theorem  c. in section  [ sec - affine ] , we turn to the affine case .",
    "the paper ends with appendix detailing the structure of the valuation spaces @xmath87 and @xmath89 in the same spirit as the local case in  @xcite .",
    "this work was partially carried out when the authors were visiting rims , kyoto .",
    "we thank this institute for its hospitality , and prof .",
    "shishikura for his exceptional kindness .",
    "we also thank r.  a.  mollin for suggesting the proof of lemma  [ l - quadra ] and the referee for useful remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly review the approach to valuation theory worked out in  @xcite . except in section  [ sec - affine ] and appendix  [ sec - app ]",
    "we let @xmath74 denote the ring of holomorphic germs at the origin in @xmath0 .",
    "this is a local ring .",
    "its maximal ideal @xmath91 is the set of germs vanishing at the origin , and its residue field is @xmath85 .",
    "we write @xmath92 for the completion of @xmath74 .",
    "it is the ring of formal power series in two complex variables .",
    "we consider the space @xmath76 of centered , normalized _ valuations _ on @xmath74 , i.e.  the set of functions @xmath93 $ ] satisfying :    1 .",

    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath76 is equipped with a natural _ partial ordering _ : @xmath100 iff @xmath101 for all @xmath102 . the _ multiplicity valuation _",
    "@xmath103 defined by @xmath104 is the unique minimal element of @xmath76 .",
    "some natural maximal elements ( for the partial ordering above ) are the _ curve valuations _ defined as follows .",

    "note that @xmath118 .",
    "the set @xmath119 of local irreducible curves carries a natural ( ultra)metric in which @xmath119 has diameter 1 .",
    "it is given by @xmath120 .",
    "arguably the most important valuations in @xmath76 are the _ quasimonomial _ ones .",
    "they are of the form @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , and satisfy @xmath123 .",
    "we have @xmath124 iff @xmath125 ; and @xmath126 iff @xmath127 .",
    "thus @xmath128 , the set of all quasimonomial valuations , is naturally a quotient of @xmath129 , and has a natural tree structure : if @xmath130 and @xmath131 , then the _ segment _ @xmath132=\\{\\mu\\in{{\\mathcal{v}_{\\mathrm{qm}}}}\\ ; \\ \\nu\\le\\mu\\le\\nu'\\}$ ] is isomorphic to a compact real interval .",
    "we set @xmath133 when @xmath111 .",
    "quasimonomial valuations are of two types : _ divisorial _ and _ irrational _ , depending on whether the parameter @xmath134 is rational or irrational .",
    "the full space @xmath76 is the completion of @xmath128 in the sense that every element in @xmath76 is the limit of an increasing sequence in @xmath128 .",
    "it is hence also naturally a tree , called the _",
    "valuative tree_. the _ ends _",
    "( i.e.  maximal elements ) of @xmath76 are exactly the elements of @xmath135 and are either curve valuations or _ infinitely singular _ valuations .",
    "a _ subtree _ of @xmath76 is a subset @xmath136 such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 implies @xmath139 .",
    "a subtree is _ finite _ if it has finitely many ends .      a curve valuation @xmath140 is characterized by the fact that the prime ideal @xmath141 is nontrivial , generated by @xmath142 .",
    "if @xmath143 is not a curve valuation , then its _ type _",

    "the residue field of the valuation is @xmath150 and @xmath145 is its transcendence degree over @xmath85 .",
    "an important invariant of a valuation is its _ skewness _ @xmath151 defined by @xmath152 .",
    "skewness naturally _ parameterizes _ the trees @xmath128 and @xmath76 in the sense that @xmath153 is strictly increasing and restricts to a bijection onto its image on any segment ; indeed @xmath154 for any @xmath155 .",
