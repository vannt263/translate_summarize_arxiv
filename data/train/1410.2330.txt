    "partial - covering absorption ( e.g. tanaka 2004 ) and blurred reflection models ( e.g. ross & fabian 2005 ) are consistently debated in attempts to explain the x - ray behaviour of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "x - ray weak and low - flux observations provide the potential to study the underlying physical processes in the absence of the power law continuum that dominates the spectrum at high - flux levels ( e.g gallo 2006 ) . for example , observing agn when they are dimmed by extreme absorption can potentially constrain the ionisation , column density and location of the absorber with high precision , providing insight on the material being accreted or expelled by the black hole system ( e.g. turner & miller 2009 ) . on the other hand , observing the reflection dominated spectrum in the low - flux state can reveal the nature of the inner accretion disc ( e.g. reynolds 2012 ) , the physics of matter under extreme gravity ( e.g. fabian 2009 ) , the geometry of the x - ray region ( e.g. wilkins 2014 ) , and even the black hole spin ( e.g. brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "consequently , campaigns to catch agn at low - flux levels have become increasingly important ( e.g. gallo 2011a , 2011b ; fabian 2012 ; grupe 2012 , hereafter g12 ) .",
    "the challenge is then to deal with the reduced signal - to - noise that accompanies the low - flux levels .",
    "the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) , 335 ( @xmath5 ) , has invited much interest in the last decade .",
    "historically it has been known as one of the brightest x - ray sources in the sky even detected with _",
    "uhuru _ ( tananbaum 1978 ) , but its departure into an x - ray weak and consistent low or moderate flux state ( e.g grupe 2008 ) marks what may be considered the new normal for this active galaxy .",
    "its lowest flux level in recent years was about @xmath6 of the previously lowest observed flux ( grupe 2007 ) , but it is regularly only @xmath7 the expected x - ray flux given its uv brightness ( g12 ) . despite the extremely diminished x - ray flux ,",
    "335  remains relatively bright and therefore the source provides a unique opportunity to study the behaviour of agn at low flux levels with respectable signal - to - noise .",
    "data of 335  when the source was bright have been described comparably well with partial covering ( e.g. tanaka 2005 ; longinotti 2007 ; oneill 2007 ) and blurred reflection ( e.g. ballantyne 2001 ; crummy 2006 ; larsson 2008 ) .",
    "timing studies , in particular the lag analysis of the iron k@xmath8 emission line in the  high state , strongly support the relativistic reflection interpretation ( kara 2013 ) .",
    "the source consistently displays a soft excess below @xmath9 that has been attributed to blurred reflection ( e.g. crummy 2006 ) , comptonisation ( e.g. patrick 2011 ) , and absorption ( e.g. middleton 2007 ) .",
    "a snap - shot  observation of 335  in the low state could be fitted with partial covering or blurred reflection ( grupe 2008 ) , but a broken power law continuum was required when fitting with the partial covering model ( grupe 2008 ) .",
    "a longer  observation in 2009 caught 335  at an intermediate flux level as the agn was transitioning from a low- to high - flux level ( g12 ; gallo 2013 , hereafter g13 ) .",
    "g13 demonstrated the spectral and timing results were completely consistent with the blurred reflection interpretation for 335 .",
    "of additional interest with the intermediate flux state observation was that it was the first time , 335  exhibited the effects of a warm absorber that was located within the broad line region and likely coming out of the accretion disc ( longinotti 2013 , hereafter l13 ) .",
    "although the source flux drops regularly 335  is highly variable and normally recovers quickly .",
    "the low - flux state of the agn has remained evasive until now . these new  observations from 2013",
    "provide the deepest pointing and longest look at 335  in the low - flux state .",
    "observed for @xmath10 over an approximately @xmath11  day period these data provide about @xmath12 as many source counts as the 2007  low - flux observation and cover an energy bandpass between @xmath13 .",
    "the data provide the opportunity to directly compare the low - flux state with the 2006  bright state ( @xmath14 exposure ) and examine the low - flux behaviour of the agn in detail .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in the next section . in section  3",
    "the differences between the high - flux and low - flux states are examined as we attempt to describe the spectral changes with both blurred reflection and partial covering .",
    "section  4 is a detailed examination of the spectral variability in the low - flux state .",
    "discussion and conclusions following in section  5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "335  has been observed with  ( mitsuda 2007 ) on two occasions in 2006 and 2013 . both observations will be examined here with added emphasis on the 2013 target of opportunity observation that was triggered to catch 335  at a low - flux level .",
    "the 2006 high state was the subject of a detailed analysis by larsson ( 2008 ) .",
    "the duration of the 2006 and 2013 observations were @xmath15 and @xmath16 days , respectively . with the approximate @xmath17 per cent on - target time due to the low - earth orbit of , exposures are about half the duration time .",
    "a summary of the observations is provided in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the new low - flux observation provides a considerable improvement ( @xmath18 more source counts ) over the 2007  snap - shot that collected only about @xmath19 source counts in the @xmath20 band .

    "the target was observed in the xis - nominal position . in 2006",
    ", the agn was observed in hxd - nominal position and the third fi ccd ( xis2 ) was still operational .",
    "cleaned event files from version 2 processed data were used in the analysis and data products were extracted using xselect . for each xis chip ,",
    "source counts were extracted from a @xmath21 circular region centred on the target .",
    "background counts were taken from surrounding regions on the chip excluding the calibration source .",
    "response files ( rmf and arf ) were generated using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen .",
    "after examining for consistency , the data from the xis - fi were combined to create a single spectrum .",
    "data below @xmath22 and between @xmath23 are not used for spectral fitting given the existing calibration uncertainties in those bands .",
    "the @xmath24 band is ignored in the 2013 spectral data due to the strong background emission from ni  k@xmath8 compared to the relatively low source flux .",
    "the pin spectrum was extracted from the hxd data following standard procedures .",
    "we extracted the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) from the event file obtained directly from the suzaku data center using the tuned model .",
    "the data were also corrected for detector deadtime . the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb )",
    "was modelled using the provided flat response files .",
    "we combined the nxb and cxb and created a total background spectrum and found that the source is not detected in the pin energy band at both epochs .",
    "the earth - occulted background , which is ideally consistent with the nxb , was also generated for a further check .",
    "we found that the @xmath25 count rate of the earth - occulted background appears lower ( @xmath26 ) than that of the nxb ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "when the nxb and the earth - occulted background are discrepant , the latter should be used .",
    "we then combined the earth - occulted background and the cxb to form a new background . the source is effectively detected between @xmath25 when adopting the new background file and the resulting pin exposures were @xmath28 and @xmath29 in 2006 and 2013 , respective .",
    "all parameters are reported in the rest frame of the source unless specified otherwise .",
    "the quoted errors on the model parameters correspond to a 90% confidence level .",
    "errors on the model parameters were computed by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) calculations ( see also reynolds et al 2012 , steiner & mcclintock 2012 ) .",
    "the mcmc algorithm computes the probability distribution of the model parameters given the data ( i.e. the posterior probability ) , from which both the best - fitting values and the errors can be determined .",
    "the algorithm performs a ` guided walk ' through the parameter space such that the probability distributions of each of the parameters among the chain steps match the posterior probability distributions of the parameters .    to illustrate such a scheme",
    ", we follow the metropolis - hastings algorithm ( hastings 1970 ) , a so - called ` walker ' is started at a given point in the parameter space , here taken to be the best - fitting values of the parameters found during the initial fit of the model to the data . from this point ,",
    "a random step is taken in the parameter space with distributions in each parameter drawn from the diagonal of the covariance matrix found during the fit ( this is the variance of each parameter ) .",
    "the likelihood of data given the model with these new parameters is then computed .",
    "if this is greater than the likelihood at the previous position ( i.e. the fit to the data is improved ) , the walker definitely moves to the new location .",
    "if not , the walker moves to the new location , but only with a probability defined by the ratio of the likelihoods at the new and old locations . therefore , the walker may move or the step may be rejected and the walker may stay at the same location on any iteration . the process is then repeated , with the walker either moving or staying put over a defined number of steps , and the probability distribution of the model parameters given the data is built up as the walker moves .",
    "we use mcmc methods to determine the errors in the model parameters as these can simultaneously and efficiently find the errors in multiple parameters simultaneously and better sample the parameter space than traditional methods , simply stepping through parameter values , performing a fit to the spectrum at each value and evaluating the variation in the goodness - of - fit at each stage .",
    "mcmc methods are less vulnerable to local minima in the goodness - of - fit , with their ergodicity meaning that they explore the full parameter space and also less vulnerable to steep gradients in the goodness - of - fit causing the error calculation to simply peg at the hard limits set for the parameter .    rather than using the metropolis - hastings sampler , we use that of goodman & weare ( 2010 ) , implemented through the emcee package in python .",
    "the goodman - weare algorithm is better able to cope with degeneracies between model parameters and is insensitive to the absolute scaling of the probability distributions .",
    "we trace multiple walkers through the parameter space simultaneously ( for good sampling , the number of walkers should be more than twice the number of model parameters ) and the final chain is formed by combining the steps of all the walkers .",
    "we simply assume a uniform prior ( i.e. make no prior assumptions about the probability distributions of the model parameters except for their hard limits set in the spectral fit ) .",
    "the first 1000 steps of each walker s chain are discarded to remove bias introduced by the choice of starting location and in order to test that the chains have converged , the calculations are run 320000 times to ensure they converge upon the same parameter values .",
    "finally , in order to ensure that the walkers are adequately sampling the parameter space , the rule - of - thumb is that steps should be rejected less than 75 per cent of the time ( i.e. less than 75 per cent of the steps in the chain are simply repeats of the previous step s values ) .",
    "we find that in order to properly sample the parameter space , it is necessary to fit only the combined spectrum from the front - illuminated xis detectors . attempting to fit data from the xis and pin detectors simultaneously , we find , results in high repeat fractions ( @xmath30 per cent ) in the markov chains , most likely caused by the simultaneous fit between the two data sets leading to sharp increases in the likelihood function between parameter values , thus causes the markov chain to fail to reproduce the probability distribution .",
    "a value for the galactic column density toward 335  of @xmath31 ( kalberla 2005 ) is adopted in all of the spectral fits and abundances are from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "luminosities are calculated using a hubble constant of @xmath32=@xmath33 and a standard flat cosmology with @xmath34 = 0.3 and @xmath35 = 0.7 .",
    "significant changes between the high - flux state and low - flux state are clearly evident in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : highlow ] .",
    "the average spectrum is much steeper and exhibits fewer distinct features during the 2006 high - flux state .",
    "strong curvature is seen in the 2013 low - flux observations along with strong , distinct features in the  band and around @xmath36 . a power law fitted to the @xmath37 band in",
    "the low - state renders a much poorer fit ( @xmath38 ) than for the high - flux state ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a difference spectrum ( the low - flux spectrum is subtracted from the high - flux spectrum ) fitted with a power law between @xmath37 reveals significant changes in the  band and below about @xmath40 . despite significant changes below @xmath41",
    "the high - energy spectrum between @xmath25 is nearly identical at both epochs .      to obtain additional constraints on the emission components in 335 , we study the frequency - resolved time lags .",
    "these provide a measure of the time delay between different energy bands ( e.g. zoghbi 2010 , 2011 ; uttley 2014 ) .",
    "light curves in four energy bins between 0.5 and 10 kev were produced .",
    "the time delay as a function of frequency is calculated between each bin and some reference band , taken in this case to be the whole @xmath42 band ( excluding the band for which the lag is calculated so the noise remain uncorrelated ) . the maximum likelihood method in zoghbi ( 2013 )",
    "was used to calculate the lags because of the gaps in the light curves caused by the  low - earth orbit .",
    "[ fig : lag ] shows the lag - energy plots for three frequency bands for the low- and high - flux observations . in order to directly compare the lag results with that of kara ( 2013 )",
    ", we use the same two frequency bins .",
    "the  observation covers slightly longer time - scales , so we have an extra frequency bin ( shown on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : lag ] ) . starting with the high flux observations , the lag for the two highest frequencies are very similar to those found in  data ( kara 2013 ) . on the longest time - scales ,",
    "a continuum lag characterized by an increase with energy seem to be present , with a possible structure at @xmath9 , though not very significant .",
    "the results for the low flux observation are interesting .",
    "the uncertainties in the highest frequencies are large and it is not clear whether there is any significant structure or deviation from a constant . for the middle and left panels ( intermediate and lowest frequencies )",
    ", there is a clear increase in lag with energy ( i.e. hard lags ) .",
    "it is intriguing to note that despite the significant difference in the spectrum between the high and low flux observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : highlow ] ) , the low frequency lags do not seem to change .",
    "the low frequency lags are usually interpreted as continuum lags that are intrinsic to the power law spectral component .",
    "this is how they were interpreted in the high flux  observation ( kara 2013 ) .",
    "if the primary component has indeed diminished in the low state as is often suggested in blurred reflection models , the fact we observe the lag in the low - flux data indicates the power law lag is being echoed in another spectral component .      to investigate the spectral variability between the high and low states in mrk  335 in a model - independent manner we use principal component analysis ( pca).this is a powerful method for extracting the spectra of multiple spectral components from a variable source ( kendall 1975 ) .",
    "we use the singular value decomposition ( svd , press 1992 ) based pca code described in parker ( 2014a ) to compute the principal components .",
    "we follow the same method as parker , but we use 100 logarithmic energy bins to show narrow features and longer intervals of 30  ks to compensate for the lower count rate , particularly in the low state .    we find two highly significant components in our analysis , with the first component responsible for @xmath43  per cent of the variability and the second @xmath44  per cent , with the remainder indistinguishable from noise .",
    "the spectra of these components are shown in fig .",
    "[ pcafig_statechange ] . the primary component , which corresponds to the bulk of the variability in the state change , shows a general decrease with energy and a narrow iron line at 6.4  kev .",
    "normally , the effect of a narrow emission line is to suppress the spectral variability at that energy ( pushing the component towards zero ) , as distant reflection is relatively invariant . in this case",
    ", however , the line appears to be enhanced rather than damped in the primary component .",
    "this is probably due to the large interval ( 7 years ) between observations , so some variability can be seen in the iron line - a higher continuum flux should correspond to more distant reflection being observed in general .",
    "the normalizations of the two components split the dataset cleanly into the two states . in fig .",
    "[ pcafig_pcnorms ] we plot the component normalisations against each other , for each of the input spectra .",
    "this helps to shed light on the role of the second component , which is most strongly variable in the low state .",
    "this component is clearly anti - correlated with the primary component in the low state , as shown in the inset , and its main role is therefore likely to be as a correction to the primary component , such that it reproduces the dominant variability mechanism in the low state . by subtracting this second component from the first",
    ", the low energy variability will be suppressed , and the high energy variability enhanced , making it appear more like the primary component found from pca of just the low state ( see section  [ sect : pca ] ) .",
    "the sharp feature around 9  kev appears to be due to noise , and disappears when the data is more highly binned .",
    "we note the difference in the components returned here from those found in ngc  1365 ( parker 2014b ) .",
    "ngc  1365 shows very strong evidence of both partial - covering absorption and relativistic reflection(risaliti 2013 ) , however the variability is dominated by changes in the column density and covering fraction of the absorber ( walton 2014 ) . as a result",
    ", the components returned from pca of that source showed a clear and sharp absorption edge at 7  kev .",
    "this is also seen in simulations , and in other sources with strong absorption variability ( parker et al . , submitted ) .",
    "the absence of such features here suggests that absorption is not the dominant cause of the long - term spectral variability in this source .",
    "the blurred reflection model has been very successful in fitting many seyferts and nls1s including 335  ( e.g. larsson 2008 ; g13 ; walton 2013 ) . in this section",
    "we examine if the average high- and low - flux spectra can be fitted with self - consistent blurred reflection models . we consider a simple geometry where the primary x - ray source seen by the observer , modeled as a power law with a high - energy exponential cutoff , also irradiate the accretion disc .",
    "some of the emission striking the accretion disc is backscattered into the observers line - of - sight creating a reflection spectrum ( e.g. ross & fabian 2005 ) that is blurred by dynamics in the disc and relativistic effects close to the black hole ( e.g. fabian 1989 ; laor 1991 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "the photon index and normalisation of the primary power law is free to vary at each epoch while the cutoff energy is fixed at @xmath45 .",
    "recent  observations of 335  ( parker 2014 ) , contemporaneous with the low - flux  observation presented here find no evidence of the cutoff being at @xmath46 , therefore fixing it to a high energy well outside the the  pin band is reasonable .",
    "the backscattered emission from the disc is modeled with the reflionx model in xspec .",
    "the iron abundance is free to vary , but is linked between the two flux states .",
    "we consider scenarios in which only the ionisation parameter ( @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath49 is the incident flux ) or the model normalisation are allowed to vary at each epoch .",
    "these provide reasonable fits , but better models are obtained when both parameters are free to vary in each spectrum .",
    "this emission component is then blurred for relativistic effects using the kerrconv model ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "the dimensionless black hole spin parameter ( @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular momentum of the black hole of mass @xmath52 ) and the disc inclination ( @xmath53 ) are linked between the two epochs as they are not expected to vary .",
    "the disc is assumed to extend down to the inner most stable circular orbit ( @xmath54 ) and the disc emissivity profile is described with a broken power law index ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the emissivity profile between @xmath54 and the break radius ( @xmath56 ) is described by @xmath57 and beyond @xmath56 the index is described by @xmath58 .",
    "various combinations are attempted to fit the emissivity profile , but the multi - epoch data are most efficiently fit when @xmath59 and the break radius is fixed at @xmath60 .    a second reflionx component that is not blurred and whose flux remains constant at both epochs is also included to mimic emission from a distant reflector like the torus .",
    "the component would produce the narrow   emission line at @xmath61 and contribute flux to the @xmath62 band via the compton hump .",
    "the ionisation parameter of this distant reflector is fixed at @xmath63 and the iron abundance is set to the solar value . adopting a solar iron abundance for the distant torus is not unreasonable without evidence to the contrary .",
    "the iron abundance close to the black hole is often seen to be super - solar in the inner regions of the accretion disc for various possible reasons like the radiative levitation of iron ions in the disc ( reynolds 2012 ) or the effects of returning radiation in the inner disc ( ross , fabian & ballantyne 2002 ) , but the abundances may or may not need be so high at larger distances like in the broad line region or warm absorber ( e.g. komossa & mathur 2001 ; leighly & moore 2004 ; fields 2005 ; l13 ) . the photon index of the power law source illuminating the torus is fixed at @xmath64 .",
    "the torus likely sees a different power law photon index than the observer or the inner disc because of different lines - of - sight through the corona .",
    "in addition , given the large light travel time delays the torus is probably not sensitive to rapid changes in @xmath65 that would influence the inner disc .",
    "therefore the photon index of the power law illuminating the torus is fixed to the average photon index observed over long - term monitoring of 335 .",
    "these assumptions simplify the fitting , but have little influence on the overall spectral model since the component is secondary to the power law and/or blurred reflector , and since the pin data are of modest quality .",
    "note that walton ( 2013 ) and parker ( 2014 ) treat the distant reflector in 335  differently than how we have done here , but the results are comparable .    furthermore , the emission from the torus could have varied over the seven years between observations and there is some evidence to support this in the multi - epoch pca ( fig .",
    "[ pcafig_statechange ] ) .",
    "however , no significant variability was seen in the spectral analyses ( e.g. see table  [ tab : hilofit ] ) , likely due to signal - to - noise , so the component is linked for much of the analysis .",
    "the described model produces a reasonable fit to to both spectra , but there are noticeable residuals in the low - flux spectrum .",
    "an excess is seen at approximately @xmath36 that could be well reproduced by the addition of a narrow ( @xmath66 ) gaussian profile ( @xmath67 for 2 additional fit parameters : energy and normalisation ) .",
    "the @xmath68 feature was not required in the high - flux spectrum with the normalisation being consistent with zero when a gaussian profile was included .",
    "the emission feature is comparable in flux and energy to that reported by grupe ( 2007 ) during the 2007 low - flux state  snap - shot observation of 335 .",
    "the residuals to this model portray an absorption - like feature at approximately @xmath69 in the low - flux spectrum that could arise from highly ionised iron in a warm absorber .",
    "longinotti ( 2013 ) modeled the complex absorption seen in the intermediate flux - state of 335  with a triple - zone warm absorber .",
    "these absorbers were then included by g13 when they analyzed the continuum of 335  during the intermediate flux state .",
    "the hottest absorber in the l13 model would generate features at the observed energies .",
    "the inclusion of the hottest absorber with its parameters fixed to the values found by g13 ( and consistent with l13 ) was a statistical improvement ( @xmath70 ) , however including all three of the l13 warm absorbers did not enhance the fit further . allowing the column density ( @xmath71 ) and ionisation parameter of the hottest absorber to vary did not significantly improve the fit either ( @xmath72 for 2 addition fit parameters ) . adding warm absorbers to",
    "the high - flux spectrum was unnecessary in agreement with previous studies of 335  in the high - flux state ( e.g. larsson 2008 ; l13 ) .",
    "analysing the fit in more detail reveals a possible degeneracy between the iron abundance and the spin parameter .",
    "indeed the error analysis converges on two possible combinations of these parameters . to examine this",
    "further the described reflection model was fitted to the high - flux and low - flux state separately .",
    "the fits to the high- and low - flux states are comparable in all ways ( table  [ tab : hilofit ] ) except that each flux - level is better fit with a different combination of iron abundance and spin parameter .",
    "[ fig : cont ] highlights the discrepancy showing that slightly more extreme values of spin and iron abundance are required in the low - flux spectrum .",
    "notably , both fits require an iron overabundance compared to solar and the black hole spin that is near maximum ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that the degeneracy appears to exist between the iron abundance and spin parameter , and the influence on the determination of other model parameters appears negligible ( e.g. compare the parameters in table  [ tab : hilofit ] and table  [ tab : meanfit ] ) .",
    "this mild degeneracy does not adversely influence other spectral analyses , such as the emissivity profile analysis .",
    "uncertainties in the iron abundance do not affect the accuracy of the measured accretion disc emissivity profiles .",
    "an increased iron abundance improves the statistical constraint on the emissivity measured from the iron k@xmath8 line , with a greater number of photon counts to constrain the contribution from each part of the disc , but since the narrow iron line is convolved with the relativistic blurring kernel , an under- or over - estimate of the iron abundance affects only the overall normalisation of the emissivity profile , not the measured shape of the profile which reveals the geometry of the corona .",
    "since neither the spin nor iron abundance should vary over these observed time scales , in attempt to achieve a consistent model both epochs were fitted simultaneously while fixing the spin parameter to the different best - fit value found in the low- and high - flux state . a slightly better fit ( @xmath74 versus @xmath75 for the same number of free parameters )",
    "was found when the multi - epoch spectra were matched with the higher spin value ( @xmath76 ) rather than the lower spin value ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this combined fit is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : refmean ] and table  [ tab : meanfit ] .",
    "the blurred reflection model is able to describe the average high- and low - flux states of 335  relatively well .",
    "the well known flattening of the primary continuum with diminishing flux is observed . at low - flux levels 335",
    "is reflection dominated with a reflection fraction of @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is the ratio of the reflection and power law component in the @xmath80 band ) .",
    "the high value of @xmath79 is in agreement with the higher spin value of @xmath76 according to simulations by dauser ( 2014 ) . in comparison , during the bright state @xmath81 . in accordance ,",
    "the emissivity profile is steeper in 2013 indicating the x - ray emission is originating from a more compact region and the continuum is more influenced by light bending than in the high - flux state .",
    "the particularly low @xmath79 during the high - flux state suggests that in a lamp post geometry the primary x - ray source is at a large distance from the accretion disc .",
    "the blurring model kerrconv is replaced with the relconv_lp ( dauser 2013 ) that calculates an emissivity profile for the disc based on the height of the source above it .",
    "the source height above the disc ( @xmath82 ) is one of the measured model parameters .",
    "fitted to the high - flux state of 335 , the relconv_lp blurring model generates comparable results and quality of fit as the model in table  [ tab : hilofit ] ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the height of the primary x - ray source above the disc is measured to be @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast , applying the same model to the low - flux spectra ( @xmath85 ) results in an upper - limit of @xmath86 for the height of the x - ray source and is consistent with the values measured in the  observation ( parker 2014 ) .",
    "having established that blurred reflection models describe well the high- and low - flux spectra self - consistently , we investigate more closely the relativistically blurred reflection spectrum and the underlying changes that caused the transition from high to low flux by measuring the emissivity profile of the accretion disc ; that is the reflected flux as a function of radius on the disc , revealing how the accretion disc is illuminated by the corona .",
    "we employ the method of wilkins & fabian ( 2011 ) to compute the emissivity profile , dividing the blurred reflection spectrum into the contributions from successive radii in the disc , described by the reflionx model , convolved with the kdblur blurring kernel in which the inner and outer radius parameters are set accordingly for each annulus and each has a flat emissivity profile .",
    "the inclination of the accretion disc ( for all annuli ) is set to the best fitting value found in the previous fit to the full spectrum , so too are the iron abundance and ionisation parameter of the accretion disc .",
    "also included in the spectral model is the unblurred reflection from distant material and intrinsic absorption by the outflowing material , again with parameters set to the best - fitting values found above .",
    "the normalisation ( i.e. the contribution ) of each annulus to the reflection spectrum is found by minimising @xmath87 , fitting this model to spectrum over the 3 - 10kev energy range , dominated by the prominent iron k@xmath8 emission line . in order to constrain the emissivity profile of the inner part of the disc , particularly over the range @xmath88 ,",
    "it is necessary to also fit over the range @xmath89 , thereby excluding the core of the line dominated by the outer parts of the disc , @xmath90 ( see wilkins & fabian 2011 for a full discussion ) .",
    "errors are computed by performing a markov chain monte carlo calculation to obtain the probability distribution of the normalisation of the reflection from each annulus , starting from the best - fitting values found by minimising @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig : emiss ] shows the measured emissivity profiles of the accretion disc during the high- and low - flux states and it is clear that there is a significant difference in the illumination of the accretion disc by the corona between the two observations . in both cases",
    ", the emissivity profile falls off steeply over the innermost part of the disc , with a profile approximating @xmath91 out to @xmath92 , as expected for the illumination of the inner parts of an accretion disc around a black hole .",
    "the emission reaching the innermost parts of the disc is enhanced by gravitational light bending , focusing rays towards the black hole , as well as time dilation , with observers closer to the black hole measuring more flux from the corona as their time is slowed with respect to those further out , and the emissivity profile is defined in the rest frame of the material in the disc ( wilkins & fabian 2012 , miniutti 2003 , suebsuwong 2006 ) .    during the low - flux state",
    ", we see that the emissivity flattens off , with @xmath93 to around @xmath94 , from where the emissivity profile falls off as @xmath95 over the outer part of the disc .",
    "wilkins & fabian 2012 show that such an emissivity profile is expected if the accretion disc is illuminated by a relatively compact corona , confined within @xmath4 of the black hole .",
    "on the other hand , during the high - flux state , the emissivity profile falls off steeply to @xmath92 , from where it simply falls as @xmath96 over the outer part of the disc .",
    "the calculations of wilkins & fabian 2012 suggest that such a profile might be expected in the case of a collimated jet - like corona emerging perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disc and extending several tens of gravitational radii .",
    "this causes an approximately @xmath96 fall - off in the emissivity profile with a slight steepening at a radius approximately coinciding with the vertical extent of the corona , which can be hard to measure if it occurs far out in the disc ( as we would expect for a greatly extended corona ) .",
    "the measured emissivity profiles of the accretion disc during both the high- and low - flux states show that the drop in flux is associated with a collapse in the x - ray emitting corona from an extended jet - like configuration in the case of 335  to a confined region within just a few gravitational radii of the black hole .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of fabian ( 2012 ) who find that the extremely low flux state into which the nls1 galaxy 1h0707@xmath97495 was observed to drop in 2011 could be explained by a similar collapse in the corona , in this case to within just @xmath98 of the black hole and is a more abrupt version of the continuous variation in the extent of the corona as the x - ray flux varies , reported by wilkins ( 2014 ) .",
    "an often advocated alternative to the blurred reflection model for 335  is the partial covering model ( e.g. grupe al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) . in this scenario",
    "the observed spectral changes and behaviour arise from changes in a line - of - sight absorber ( e.g. tanaka 2004 ) and do not necessarily require the primary emitter to have altered .",
    "a simple ionised , double partial covering model ( e.g. zxipcf in xspec ) resulted in poor fit , but it was useful to highlight important aspects for fitting the model . to fit the spectra self -",
    "consistently the models required a very steep power law continuum ( @xmath99 ) arising from the strong soft excess in 335 .",
    "the absorbing medium was likely compton - thick in the low - flux state as it required a column density @xmath100 .",
    "thirdly , the narrow  emission line and excess emission in the pin band required explanation , and could be consistent with a compton thick absorber . the need for a compton - thick absorber",
    "was also supported with the absorber diagnostic diagram of tatum ( 2013 ) , where the measured hardness ratio ( defined as the ratio of the fluxes in the @xmath101 and @xmath102 bands ) of @xmath103 in the low - flux state would require about @xmath104 per cent covering of the primary source by a neutral , compton - thick medium . in the high - flux state the covering fraction was negligible ( @xmath105 ) . with these points in mind",
    "a more realistic absorption model was generated .    rather than modelling the primary continuum with a simple cutoff power law the comptonisation model optxagnf ( done 2012 )",
    "was adopted .",
    "in addition to the traditional high - temperature , optically - thin corona that generates the hard power law , optxagnf includes emission from a second , cooler comptonising layer associated with the accretion disc that can imitate the soft excess in agn . the inherent curvature in the optxagnf model diminishes the need to reproduce the spectral curvature strictly with the ionised absorption alone , thus making spectral fitting easier .",
    "patrick ( 2011 ) have previously used a double comptonisation model ( comptt + powerlaw in xspec ) to describe the soft excess and hard continuum in 335 , so such an approach is not original .",
    "the optxagnf model does generate the hard power law emission from the traditional corona , however the normalisation of this parameter is set to zero in this work ( specifically the parameter @xmath106 ) and it is replaced with a cutoff power law with @xmath107 .",
    "the reason is the cutoff in the hard component in optxagnf is fixed at @xmath108 , which would introduce curvature in the pin spectrum even if 335  is only detected up to @xmath109 .",
    "the 2006 high - flux spectrum of 335 , when the absorption seems negligible , does not seem to require a low - energy cutoff so we assume the same is true at both epochs .",
    "the model also utilizes the black hole mass ( @xmath110 ) and eddington luminosity ratio ( @xmath111 ) , which are adopted from grier ( 2012 ) and gierliski & done ( 2004 ) , respectively . the distance ( @xmath112 ) is taken to be @xmath113 . the coronal radius ( @xmath114 ) and outer disc radius ( @xmath115 )",
    "are also kept fixed during data modelling as allowing them to vary did not enhance the fits .",
    "the black hole spin parameter was not well constrained when left free to vary , but it did significantly influence the fit quality . as such three different fits were attempted with the spin parameter fixed at @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "the model with a non - rotating black hole was a significantly better fit to the data than the other models invoking higher spin , hence the parameter was set to @xmath116 .",
    "the requirement of potentially compton - thick absorption in the low - flux state motivated the adaptation of the mytorus model ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) to describe the absorption and reprocessing of the partial covering absorber in a self - consistent manner .",
    "specifically , the _ decoupled mode _",
    "example described by yaqoob ( 2012 ) for ngc  4945 is adopted to mimic a patchy absorber covering the primary x - ray source .",
    "the principal difference between the yaqoob ( 2012 ) model for ngc  4945 and that proposed here for 335  is that the x - ray emitting region is larger than the obscuring clouds and thus can be partially covered ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mytpic ] compared to figure 2 of yaqoob 2012 ) . in this scenario",
    "the non - variable primary source ( modelled with optxagnf ) is surrounded by a clumpy distribution of absorbers and the observed spectrum is generated from three different processes that occur in this clumpy medium .",
    "the model includes : ( i ) emission that transverses material in the line - of - sight ( transmitted emission ) ; ( ii ) reflection of the intrinsic continuum by material out of the line - of - sight ; and ( iii ) scattering emission from material in the line - of - sight .",
    "the two latter components are each associated with their own fluorescent line emission (  and ) and compton hump emission at @xmath119 , thus can offer a natural explanation for the spectral features in 335 . for simplicity ,",
    "the column densities of each absorber are linked , but could be allowed to vary to reproduce more complex medium .",
    "the specific mytorus table used is for a plasma temperature of @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , we include a direct component that reaches the observer without interacting with any obscuring clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mytpic ] ) .",
    "the model can approximately describe the differences between the two epochs as arising from changes in the covering fraction of the direct line - of - sight absorber ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the scattered and reflected components are constant between the two epochs and the reflected component is negligible compared to the scattered emission . for the high - flux state the model reasonably accounts for the iron line emission and pin emission . however , as with the blurred reflection model , residuals remain in the low - flux state .",
    "the addition of a narrow ( @xmath66 ) emission line at @xmath122 in the low state is a significant improvement ( @xmath123 for the 2 additional fit parameters energy and normalisation ) .",
    "the absorption - like feature at about @xmath69 appears deeper in this model . the hottest absorber used in l13 and g13",
    "was introduced to fit the high energy residuals . allowing the parameter of this component to vary produced a significantly improved fit ( @xmath124 for the 3 additional fit parameters column density , ionisation and redshift ) . introducing all three warm absorbers used by l13",
    "did not significantly improve the fit further even if all parameters were allowed to vary freely .",
    "the picture described reproduces the high - flux state very well , but not the low - flux spectrum ( @xmath125 ) as significant excess residuals are seen between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the similarity in the high- and low - flux spectra above @xmath41 and similar flux of the narrow iron line suggests that the primary continuum and emitters of the scattered / reflected components do not vary significantly between the two epochs",
    ". the line - of - sight absorption is very different as @xmath128 per cent of the primary continuum is absorbed by nearly compton - thick material in the low - flux state , where as the high - flux state is unobscured .",
    "the final model and fit parameters are presented in fig  [ fig : mytmean ] and table  [ tab : mytmeanfits ] .",
    "the partial covering fit can certainly be improved in a number of ways .",
    "for example , adding two more partial covering absorbers , one that is ionised and one that is neutral , improves the fit quality significantly ( @xmath129 for 5 additional free parameters and a @xmath130 ) .",
    "still more absorbers could be added to improve the fit quality further , but degeneracies are an obvious concern . while any absorber in the vicinity of the black hole is likely to be complex and exhibit density , temperature , and ionisation gradients it becomes impossible to justify adding more components without evidence like that which may eventually become available with future calorimeter data .",
    "the current partial covering model adopts a rigid assumption that the x - ray continuum ( power law and soft comptonisation ) is non - variable over the seven years between observations . allowing the continuum components to differ in the high- and low - flux states",
    "significantly improves the overall partial covering fit ( @xmath131 for 4 additional free parameters and a @xmath132 ) .",
    "the differences in the soft comptonisation component are negligible between the two flux levels .",
    "the temperature and optical depth are approximately @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively at both epochs .",
    "this is predictable when viewing residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig : mytmean ] that show the spectra are well fit with the same continuum model below @xmath135 .",
    "the difficulty for the model arises in simultaneously addressing the @xmath136 curvature and the high flux above @xmath137 . to achieve this",
    "the model requires an inverted power law ( @xmath138 ) in the low - flux state .",
    "such spectra have not been reported before for radio - quiet agn and seem unphysical .",
    "there is the alternative possibility that when bright the x - ray emitting region in 335  is dominated by compact coronal emission and blurred reflection , however the excursions to low - flux levels is driven by partial covering absorption .",
    "such hybrid models are rather complex and push the limits of what can be reasonable discerned from current models and data quality .    the reflection spectrum for 335  in the 2006 high state ( table  [ tab : meanfit ] )",
    "is adopted as the intrinsic continuum for the low - flux state in 2013 . applying the partial covering model ( and warm absorber ) , as in section  [ sect : meanpc ] , while preserving the continuum did not result in a good fit to the low - flux spectra ( @xmath139 ) . as discussed in the previous section , maintaining",
    "the continuum constant over 7  years is a rigid demand .",
    "therefore , the data are refit while allowing the power law continuum parameters ( normalisation and photon index ) and the reflection parameters ( ionisation parameter and normalisation ) to vary as well as the absorbers .",
    "the blurring parameters are initially kept fixed to the average values .",
    "the model results in a reasonable fit of the data ( @xmath140 ) . in this scenario",
    ", the low - flux state is achieved through considerable variability of continuum components that are significantly covered ( @xmath141 per cent ) by a compton - thick medium ( @xmath142 ) . as with other models , the challenge is once again to simultaneously describe the curvature between @xmath136 and the high flux in the pin band during the low - flux state . to accommodate , the power law flattens substantially from @xmath143 in the high state to @xmath144 in the low state .",
    "as previously mentioned , the spectrum seems particularly hard for a radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , the flatter intrinsic spectrum has the net effect of increasing the flux across the band , and also flattening the reflection component .",
    "consequently , the spectrum at high energy is dominated by the blurred reflection component and in turn the reflection fraction is high ( @xmath145 compared to @xmath146 in the high state ) , rendering the spectrum reflection dominated .",
    "partial covering of a blurred reflection spectrum can account for the low state in 335 , but only with significant changes to the x - ray emitting components , which may be unrealistic .",
    "in such a scenario the corona would need to collapse to a few gravitational radii to reproduce the reflection dominated spectrum . in order to partially cover the compact source",
    "requires the compton - thick absorber to be confined to within a similarly small region , which is challenging ( reynolds 2012 ) .",
    "the 2013  pointing of 335  marks the longest exposure of the agn in its low - flux state and the variability in these data are examined in detail here . given the difficulties in explaining the multi - epoch data and the low - state with partial covering in this ( section  [ sect : meanpc ] ) and previous works ( e.g. g12 ) , concentration will be placed on discussing the intra - observation variability in the low state in terms of the blurred reflection model .",
    "the @xmath147 light curve of 335  is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] with the data in orbital bins ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the broadband light curve exhibits significant variability over the observation with the most distinguishing event being a `` flare '' approximately @xmath149 from the start of the observation .",
    "the flux more than doubles during the brightening incident that lasts about @xmath150 before returning to pre - flare brightness .",
    "given the duration of the occurrence it is difficult to draw direct analogies with the very rapid flares seen in agn that last only several kilo - seconds .",
    "the flare is present in all energy bands and in examining the spectral variability as a function of time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) it appears the hardness ratios between low - energy ( @xmath151 ) and high - energy bands ( @xmath152 ) are approximately constant .",
    "however the hardness ratio between the soft and intermediate ( @xmath153 ) band does exhibit hardening during the flare that endures for approximately @xmath150 after the brightness diminishes .    investigating the hardness ratio as a function of count rate before and after the flare revealed interesting behaviour in one particular comparison . the spectral variability between the lowest and highest energy bands appeared to become correlated with the count rate after the x - ray flare .",
    "[ fig : hrcr ] ( top left panel ) shows that prior to the flare ( time segments a , b , and c ; black circles ) there was no significant correlation between the count rate and hardness ratio .",
    "however , after the flare ( calculate for time segments e , f , g , and h ; red diamonds ) the spectrum hardens with increasing count rate .",
    "in addition , both these energy bands are reflection dominated if the presented reflection scenario is correct .",
    "similar behaviour was discovered in the nls1 i  zw  1 ( gallo 2007 ) , but a clear origin was evasive .",
    "the behaviour is often clearly seen in stellar mass black holes that exhibit proper `` state changes '' , but the time scales at which these changes occur in agn do not correspond with similar time scales in stellar mass black holes .    the fractional variability ( @xmath154 ) in various energy bands is calculated following edelson ( 2002 ) with the  light curves in @xmath148 bins .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from ponti ( 2004 ) . the @xmath154 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] , top panel ) exhibits the often seen bell - shaped curve that is interpreted in the blurred reflection model as variable power law and less variable reflection component in a reflection - dominated flux state .",
    "indeed , the peak amplitude in the @xmath154 spectrum occurs in the @xmath155 band where the power law seems to have the most contribution to the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : refmean ] ) .",
    "the @xmath154 spectrum during the 2006 high - flux state was flatter ( figure 11 of larsson 2008 ) than during this epoch , which would be consistent with the spectrum being dominate by a single component .",
    "the @xmath154 spectrum also reveals more complex behaviour .",
    "overplotted on the spectrum is the @xmath154 expected if only the normalisation of the power law was responsible for all the variations .",
    "clearly , the model indicates that arises from variations in more than one parameter or component .",
    "in addition , in fig .  [",
    "fig : fvar ] the fractional variability spectrum is also calculated for times in the light curve that do not include the flare ( approximately all of time segment d ) ( red , open squares ) .",
    "while this spectrum shows a very similar shape to the one that includes all data ( black , open circles ) , the ratio between the two spectra indicates differences in the soft band below @xmath135 , again reinforcing that changes in power law normalisation alone are not sufficient to describe the spectral variations .",
    "similar behaviour is apparent in the difference spectrum taken when the source was flaring ( @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) and more stable ( @xmath157 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] lower panel ) .",
    "a power law fitted to the @xmath102 is rather flat ( @xmath158 ) and the ratio shows some curvature that resembles the broad reflection component .",
    "when the fit is extrapolated to lower energies there are significant deviations below @xmath159 .",
    "we now use pca to investigate variability in the low state data only .",
    "the amplitude of the variability is lower , so we have to increase the binning relative to section  [ section_pca_all ] .",
    "we use 14 broad energy bins to improve the signal to noise , but the analysis is otherwise the same as before .    we find two significant components from our analysis of the low state , responsible for @xmath160 and @xmath161 per cent of the variability respectively , with the remainder indistinguishable from noise . these components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] . the primary component is greater than zero at all energies ( implying that all bins are correlated ) , and is suppressed around the energies of the soft excess and iron line .",
    "this component is very similar to the rms variability spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] .",
    "the second component shows an anticorrelation between low and high energies , indicating the presence of a pivoting effect .",
    "these components are qualitatively similar to those found in  by parker ( 2014a ) , which also showed a primary component suppressed at these energies by a relatively constant reflection component .",
    "however , the degree of suppression is much greater in 335 , as expected given the higher reflection fraction in this source .    as in parker",
    "( 2014b ) , we next compare the principal components from the data with those obtained from simulations .",
    "to do this , we simulate a set of 50 30  ks suzaku spectra based on the best fit reflection model ( table  [ tab : meanfit ] ) using the xspec command fakeit .",
    "we fix all of the parameters apart from the normalisation and photon index of the power law to their best - fit values .",
    "we randomly vary the normalisation of the power law by a factor of three for each spectrum , and vary the photon index between 1.7 and 2.2 .",
    "this set of simulated spectra",
    "is then analysed by the pca code , in exactly the same fashion as the real data .",
    "the resulting components are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] as shaded regions . as with the examination of the @xmath154 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] ) , it is clear that changes in the power law alone are not sufficient to explain the first principal component and suggest that variability in the blurred reflector is likely required .",
    "the model of the second component agrees reasonable well with the data indicating that some fraction of the variability could be attributed to a pivoting power law .    unlike mcg6 - 30 - 15 , we do not find a third order principal component with a correlated iron line and soft excess",
    "this is likely to be a noise issue , as such a component has been found in several other sources which display the same pattern of variability at lower orders ( parker et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "we note that the level of noise in the mrk  335 analysis is higher than that in the _ xmm - newton _ data of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , so we are unable to probe to as high spectral or temporal resolution , and are limited to the first two principal components .      sections  [ sect : rvar ] and [ sect : pca ] indicate that variability from more than one component ( i.e. the power law component ) is required to describe the rapid spectral variability in the low - flux state of 335 . to examine further , eight spectra are created from the data in each of the @xmath162 time segments shown in fig  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "while this is formally a spectral analysis based on consecutive time slices of the data it also constitutes a flux - resolved analysis given the manner in which the time cuts are done .",
    "specifically , segments _ b , f , g , h _ represent low - flux levels , segments _ a , c , e _ represent intermediate flux levels , and segment _ d _ corresponds to the high flux level .",
    "the blurred reflection model is applied to each spectrum between @xmath20 .",
    "the pin data are not fitted , but the model is extrapolated to higher energies and compared to the average pin spectrum over the entire observation .",
    "spectra g and h were found to be very similar and these two consecutive spectra were fitted simultaneously to enhance signal - to - noise .",
    "initially , all the spectra were fitted with a blurred reflection model in which the power law normalisation , photon index , and the ionisation parameter of the reflector were permitted to vary .",
    "all other model parameters were fixed to the average values found in table  [ tab : meanfit ] .",
    "the model described depicts a scenario where the reflector responds to changes in the power law illumination with variations in the ionisation parameter .",
    "for half of the spectra this produced an acceptable fit , but in some cases ( spectra _ d , e , g , h _ ) , all during or after the flare , there was significant improvement when the normalisation of the reflector was also allowed to vary . for these spectra ,",

    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pocorr ] demonstrates a preference for a lower reflection fraction when the power law flux is higher , which would be anticipated if the bright power law flux is associated with a primary emitter that is more extended over the disc or at a larger distance from the black hole .",

    "[ fig : pocorr ] .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : reflcorr ] highlights some of the complexities attributed to 335 .",
    "if the agn is in a low - flux level because it is reflection - dominate then one may expect a clear correlation between the power law and reflected flux .",
    "however , this behaviour is only obviously exhibited in the post - flare data ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : reflcorr ] ) .",
    "one would also expect a direct correlation between the reflected flux and ionisation parameter . in the light bending regime",
    "the reflected flux is a better approximation of how much illuminating flux the inner disc is exposed to and this value should be correlated with the ionisation parameter .",
    "however , for 335  there appears to be an anti - correlation between these parameters suggesting there may be changes in the geometry of the primary source or the nature of the reflector .",
    "we note a need for caution when adopting light bending to interpret these results .",
    "the time bins used in the time - resolved analysis are larger ( @xmath162 ) than the variability time scales that correspond to the inner few gravitational radii where light bending is most dominant .",
    "however , the complex behaviour is comparable to the behaviour of 335  in the intermediate flux state when it was observed with  and more rapid time scales could be probed ( g13 ) .",
    "the time - resolved spectroscopy does potentially explain the hardness ratio behaviour described in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrcr ] . using the spectra from each time segment ,",
    "the hardness ratio between @xmath166 and @xmath167 is calculated for the reflection and power law component separately , and plotted against the corresponding flux ( fig .",

    "that is , the hardness ratio becomes correlated with the flux only after the flare .",
    "the power law component does not exhibit any obvious trends .",

    "fitting the spectra in a self - consistent manner was difficult with partial covering models that have been previously suggested for this source ( e.g. grupe 2008 ; g12 ) .",
    "the high - flux spectrum could result from a continuum - dominated source without any line - of - sight absorption .",
    "the narrow , neutral iron emission line and some of the @xmath25 flux could be attributed to scattered and reflected emission from the absorbing medium outside the line - of - sight .",

    "the object is clearly power - law dominated during the high state whereas 335  becomes reflection dominated in the low state when the corona becomes more compact and the source flux diminishes by @xmath171 in the @xmath20 band . as expected , the power law hardens slightly as its flux drops .",
    "we also considered the possibility the x - ray emission in 335  arises as described in the blurred reflection model , but that the transition to low state is attributed to absorption .",
    "such models were only successful if significant variability of the primary component was also permitted and always resulted in a reflection dominated system .",
    "such a scenario can not be definitively ruled out given the significant degeneracy arising from over - modelling of the data , but appears rather ad hoc .    both reflection and partial covering models in the low state require modification by a highly - ionised absorber based on the detection of an absorption - like feature at about @xmath69",
    "the feature could be attributed to the hot medium in the multi - zone warm absorber detected in 335  during the 2011 observation when the source was in an intermediate - flux state ( l13 ) .",
    "in fact , including only the hottest component of the multi - zone warm absorber found in 2011 with the same parameters used by g13 significantly improved the reflection model .",
    "the partial covering model exhibited a much stronger feature requiring the column density of the hot medium to have become @xmath172 higher than it was in @xmath173 .",
    "the blurred reflection scenario appears to be a simpler model , but still reveals some challenges .",
    "when the high- and low - flux spectra are fitted separately both prefer a different combination of iron abundance and black hole spin parameter even though all other parameters are comparable between the two flux states .",
    "the fit degeneracy between iron abundance and spin has been recognised in a number of previous works ( e.g. reynolds 2012 ; walton 2013 ) .",
    "the challenge in modelling two very different looking spectra with the same parameters is brought to the forefront in this work .",
    "however , it is important to note that for both flux states the measurements favour an iron overabundance and a nearly maximum black hole spin .",
    "simulations by dauser ( 2014 ) seem to support the higher spin value measured during the low - flux state ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "dauser argue that high reflection fractions in excess of @xmath174 can only be achieved for rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "the reflection fraction of @xmath175 in the low - flux observation requires a spin parameter @xmath176 assuming the accretion disc extends down to the isco , which is inconsistent with the lower value of @xmath177 measured in the high - flux state .",
    "conservatively , if we were to consider the combined range of possible values measured from both independent fits 335  requires an iron abundance that is a factor of @xmath178 above solar and a spin parameter @xmath179 .",
    "the results are consistent with previous measurements of 335  using data from different telescopes and with the agn in different flux states ( e.g. parker 2014 ; g13 ; walton 2013 ) .",
    "the reflection fraction during the high - flux observation is extremely low and inconsistent if considering a compact , isotropic emitting source irradiating an infinite plane - parallel disc .",
    "one could consider the possibility that the primary source is perhaps the base of a jet that is moving away from the disc at mildly relativistic speeds ( e.g. reynolds & fabian 1997 ; beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "with the primarily emission being beamed away from the disc the observer would see a lower reflection fraction and brighter source .",
    "the situation has been proposed to describe the low reflection fraction in cyg  x-1 ( beloborodov 1999 ) as well as other radio - quiet seyfert galaxies like 335  ( e.g. gallo 2011b ) . from equation ( 3 ) of beloborodov ( 1999 ) , @xmath180 , the bulk velocity of the illuminating blob of material ( @xmath181 ) is related to @xmath79 , where @xmath53 is the inclination of the system . adopting @xmath182 and @xmath183 as found in sect .",
    "[ sect : meanref ] renders @xmath184 .",
    "the velocity is similar to what was reported by liu ( 2014 ) who suggest the x - ray emission in some agn can be attributed to a bipolar outflowing corona with bulk velocities of @xmath185 . since 335",
    "is radio - quiet the material likely does not escape ( e.g. ghisellini 2004 ) , which would imply the launch point is within approximately @xmath186 from the black hole .",
    "the result is comparable to the height of the source above the accretion disc that was measured in section  [ sect : meanref ] ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the jet interpretation during the high - flux levels is consistent with the analysis of the emissivity profile . in the high - flux observation",
    "the emissivity profile falls off steeply to about @xmath187 at which point the profile flattens considerable to @xmath96 over the extent of the disc .",
    "wilkins & fabian ( 2012 ) note that such a profile is consistent with coronal emission that is being collimated away from the disc . from the spectral analysis",
    ", the putative jet should be confined to within @xmath188 if the material does not escape the system .",
    "longinotti ( 2007 ) report possible inflowing material in an  observation of 335  that could be consistent with matter falling back down on the disc .",
    "335  is radio - quiet , but not radio - silent thus it is possible that material could be ejected from the system on occasion .",
    "we note the emissivity profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emiss ] for the high state indicates there is significant illumination of the inner accretion disc .",
    "this emphasizes the difficulty in describing the primary x - ray source as a point source , and implies that it likely has some vertical extent .",
    "the spectral modelling in sect .",
    "[ sect : meanref ] , shows that the contribution of the power law component to the spectrum has diminished by a factor of ten in the low flux observation , and the spectrum is now reflection - dominated .",
    "a possible explanation of the lags in fig .  [ fig : lag ] is that the continuum lags have been mirrored by the reflection component . in this picture ,",
    "hard lags in the power - law continuum can be thought of as a series of soft flares followed , after some delay , by hard flares .",
    "the soft flares produce a relatively soft reflection spectrum while the hard flares produce a relatively harder reflection spectrum ( see for example figure 6 in garca 2013 ) .",
    "the result is the reflection spectrum itself as a whole will have hard lags .",
    "the 2013  data mark the longest observation of 335  in a low - flux state and permit the most detailed analysis of its behaviour at low - flux levels .",
    "various lines of study used in this work ( hardness ratios , @xmath154 , principal component analysis ) support the reflection dominated interpretation for the nls1 .",
    "analysis of the emissivity profile indicate the corona is compact during the low - flux extending out only to about @xmath4 .",
    "the variability in the low state is mostly driven by the power law component , but not exclusively , and variability of the blurred reflection emission is also required .",
    "the flare - like feature in the middle of the light curve seems to mark a transition in the variability behaviour of 335 .",
    "specifically , one hardness ratio ( @xmath189 ) becomes correlated with brightness only after the flare .",
    "interestingly , both energy bands should be dominated by the reflection component . slicing the data into consecutive time - bins of approximately @xmath150 duration",
    ", the time - resolved spectra were examined to study the time evolution of various parameters .",
    "one particular relation that stands out after the flare , but not obviously prior to it , is an anti - correlation between the disc ionisation parameter and the reflected flux ( or alternatively the reflection fraction ) .",
    "essentially , as the flux increases the soft excess diminishes because the ionisation parameter increases .",
    "taken at face value , it was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reflcorr ] that this behaviour could account for observed post - flare correlation between hardness ratio and count rate .",
    "the change in the shape of the soft - excess could also explain the discrepancies in the pca ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] ) and @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvar ] ) model fits .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in another nls1 , i  zw  1 ( gallo 2007 ) indicating that such behaviour may not be rare .",
    "the origin of the behaviour is not obvious .",
    "the reflected flux should indicate the level of power law illumination seen by the disc .",
    "as more light shines on the disc , more light should be reflected off the disc , but also the ionisation parameter should increase .",
    "thus , one would expect the reflected flux and ionisation parameter to be correlated .",
    "the anti - correlation possibly triggered by the flare could suggests something about the disc structure .",
    "if the flare is associated with some ejection of disc material then this could temporarily change ( i.e. decrease ) the density of the inner disc and raise the ionisation parameter . alternatively , and more simply , if the primary emitter becomes more compact the ionising flux would concentrate on the inner part of the disc making that region highly ionised , but the average ionisation parameter that is measured would be low .",
    "we have reported the deepest x - ray observation of the nls1 335   in the low - flux state and made comparison with the source when it was @xmath0 brighter in 2006 . describing the high- and",
    "low - flux spectra self - consistently seems challenging with partial covering models .",
    "blurred reflection from an accretion disc around a nearly maximum spinning black hole appears more likely and is consistent with long - term and rapid variability .",
    "the high - flux  observation of 335  is consistent with continuum - dominated , jet - like emission .",
    "it can be argued that the ejecta must be confined to within @xmath3 if it does not escape the system .",
    "longinotti ( 2007 ) have made claims of high - velocity inflowing material in an  observation of 335 , which could be consistent with the material not reaching the escape velocity and raining back down toward the disc .",
    "simultaneous x - ray and radio monitoring of 335  to investigate jet activity would be fruitful .    during the low - flux",
    "the corona becomes compact and only extends to about @xmath4 from the black hole , and the spectrum becomes reflection - dominated .",
    "the variability is dominated by the power law component , but changes in the reflector ( primarily the ionisation parameter ) over time are required .",
