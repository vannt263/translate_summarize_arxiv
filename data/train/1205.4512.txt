    "in this paper , we consider the quantum ising model defined in terms of pauli matrices @xmath8 where the transverse fields @xmath9 are independent random variables drawn with some distribution @xmath10 and where the nearest - neighbor couplings take a non - random value @xmath11 ( of course , one can also consider the case where the couplings are also random , but we have chosen to restrict to the case of non - random @xmath1 to simplify a bit the notations ) . in dimension",
    "@xmath12 , exact results for a large number of observables have been obtained by daniel fisher @xcite via the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization procedure ( for a review , see @xcite ) : the transition is governed by an infinite - disorder fixed point and presents unconventional scaling laws with respect to the pure case . in dimension @xmath0 , the strong disorder renormalization procedure can still be defined .",
    "however , it can not be solved analytically , because the topology of the lattice changes upon renormalization , but it has been studied numerically with the conclusion that the transition is also governed by an infinite - disorder fixed point in dimensions @xmath13 @xcite and on erds - renyi random graphs @xcite .",
    "these numerical renormalization results are in agreement with the results of independent quantum monte - carlo in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the complicated topology that emerges between renormalized degrees of freedom in dimension @xmath0 tends to obscure the physics , because a large number of very weak bonds are generated during the rg , that will eventually not be important for the forthcoming rg steps . in a recent work @xcite , we have thus proposed to include strong disorder rg ideas within the more traditional fixed - length - scale real space rg framework that preserves the topology upon renormalization : the idea is to allow some changes in the order of decimations with respect to the full procedure in order to maintain a simple spatial renormalized lattice .",
    "we have checked that in dimension @xmath12 , this procedure correctly captures all critical exponents except for the magnetic exponent @xmath15 which is related to persistence properties of the full rg flow . in the present paper",
    ", we introduce a similar idea for the case of the cayley tree geometry .",
    "if one applies the full strong disorder rg to a cayley tree , the tree structure is rapidly destroyed and the network of surviving clusters contains loops . here",
    "we thus introduce a modified procedure called boundary strong disorder renormalization that preserves the tree structure , so that one can write simple recursions with respect to the number of generations .",
    "the price is again that the magnetization will not be well taken into account , but one can hope that other scalings are correctly captured , as in @xcite .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case in dimension @xmath12 by a direct comparison with the exact solution of the full rg procedure .",
    "for the cayley tree , we find that when only sites are decimated within the boundary strong disorder rg , one obtains a quantitative mapping towards some directed polymer on the cayley tree : this relation with the directed polymer has been already obtained for the cayley tree via some approximations within the quantum cavity approach @xcite , and for arbitrary networks via simple perturbation deep in the disordered phase @xcite .",
    "however here we also consider the possibility of bond - decimations to build quantum ferromagnetic clusters which may become important near the transition .",

    "[ bilanpurdes ] shows that the two correlation lengths are related via @xmath83 coming from the exponential number @xmath84 of points at generation @xmath25 .",

    "that for the pure case , the present method based on second order perturbation theory in @xmath88 will be more and more justified in the critical region in the limit of large branching ratio @xmath16 since the transition takes place at smaller and smaller value of the ratio @xmath89 .      in finite dimension below the upper critical dimension @xmath90 ,",
    "the relevance of small disorder at the transition of the pure model is determined by the harris criterion @xcite or the inequality @xmath91 of chayes _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "above the upper - critical dimension @xmath92 of the pure model , the harris criterion is more involved @xcite since there is no hyperscaling and there are two distinct correlation length exponents .",
    "for the special case of the cayley tree that corresponds formally to @xmath93 , the naive adaptation of the harris criterion yields that small disorder is always irrelevant at the pure transition for the following reason : the correlated volume @xmath94 in finite dimension @xmath95 becomes @xmath96 on the cayley tree of branching ratio @xmath16 ; so the central - limit disorder fluctuations which are of order @xmath97 in finite dimension @xmath95 becomes exponentially small of order @xmath98 on the cayley tree .",
    "so these disorder fluctuations are always much smaller than the power - law distance to criticality of the pure model @xmath99 ( eq . [ jcpuredecay ] ) .",
    "note however that for quantum disordered models , these arguments based on the weak - disorder harris criterion have been questioned @xcite since rare regions can play an essential role since the disorder is actually infinitely correlated along the time - direction .",
    "the effects of rare regions are discussed in detail in the review @xcite , with the conclusion that the important parameter is the effective dimensionality @xmath100 of rare regions ( in our present quantum model where the disorder is actually infinitely correlated along the time - direction , the dimensionality of rare regions is @xmath101 @xcite ) .",
    "this dimensionality @xmath100 of rare regions should be compared to the lower critical dimension @xmath102 sufficient to obtain ordering ( in our present quantum model where the order is a ferromagnetic magnetization , the lower critical dimension is @xmath103 ) .",
    "the random quantum ising model thus corresponds to the case @xmath104 , i.e. to the so - called class b in the classification described in @xcite , where rare regions dominate the critical behavior and can induce an unusual activated scaling .",
    "( the conventional power - law scaling is expected to hold for the so - called class a corresponding to @xmath105 , where rare regions can not undergo the phase transition by themselves , whereas the so - called class c corresponds to the case @xmath106 where rare regions can order by themselves at different values of the order parameter ) .      before entering the technical solutions of the rg equation [ evolpk ] in various phases and regimes ,",
    "let us now briefly summarize the two possible scenarios that we will find for the transition of the disordered model on the cayley tree of branching ratio @xmath19 :    \\(a ) either the random quantum transition takes place in the region where quantum ferromagnetic clusters do not exist ( as in the pure case described in section [ sec_pure ] above ) or remain finite .",
    "then the ferromagnetic coupling to the boundary will be found to behave in the disordered phase as @xmath107 where the correlation length @xmath108 diverges with the typical correlation length exponent @xmath6 which coincides with the pure exponent of eq .",
    "[ nujcpuredecay ] .",
    "this case can be thus understood as a weak - disorder case where the critical exponents of the pure transition are not changed by the disorder , in agreement with the naive adaptation of the harris criterion discussed in section [ sec_harris ] above .",
    "\\(b ) or the quantum transition takes place at the point where an extensive quantum ferromagnetic cluster appears , and is thus completely different from the pure transition on the tree . we will obtain below that the renormalized transverse field scales as @xmath109 for @xmath25 generations , where the distance @xmath110 diverges with a correlation length exponent of order @xmath111 .",
    "before studying the case of real trees having @xmath19 , we consider in the present section the case of the one - dimensional chain corresponding to @xmath18 to check the validity of the boundary strong disorder rg procedure by comparison with the exact solution of the usual full rg equation @xcite .      to simplify the technical details , we now focus on the binary distribution for the initial transverse fields @xmath112 and we also fix the ferromagnetic coupling to the value @xmath113h_1,h_2[$ ] i.e. @xmath114 so that the control parameter of the transition is the fraction @xmath115 of eq .
