    "at a distance of @xmath4 kpc @xcite , the center of the milky way provides an excellent laboratory for high resolution studies of galactic nuclei . images of radio continuum emission from the region are dominated by a strong point source , sgr a * , which is most likely a @xmath5 m@xmath6 black hole located at the dynamical center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "sgr a * is surrounded by a `` mini - spiral '' composed of arcs of ionized gas that are falling towards and orbiting the black hole @xcite .",
    "a ring of molecular material at a radius of 2 pc from the galactic center surrounds the mini - spiral and is referred to as the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) @xcite .",
    "the name was inspired by early observations of hcn and hco+ which showed signatures of a single rotating disk with the center swept clear of material @xcite .",
    "the western arc of the mini - spiral traces the ionized inner edge of the cnd , while the northern and eastern arms , which extend towards sgr a * , may be the result of cloud - cloud collisions in the cnd @xcite .",
    "however , with the recent increase in sensitivity and resolution of instruments , the morphology and kinematics of the gas near the galactic center now appear to be much more complicated than originally thought .",
    "the cnd is composed of many clumps with an average density of @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "wide - field interferometric mosaics of the region in hcn(1 - 0 ) and hco+(1 - 0 ) @xcite show that the cnd has a distinct outer edge at @xmath9 from the nucleus , making it resemble a ring more than a disk .",
    "@xcite observe that the northeast and southwest lobes of the cnd appear to have different angles of inclination .",
    "while the northeastern sections of the cnd are best fit by an inclination of 70 - 75@xmath10 , the southwestern lobe of the cnd seems to be at an inclination of @xmath11 .",
    "this observation led @xcite to the conclusion that the cnd is warped .",
    "the southeastern side of the cnd is weak in many tracers ( including hcn and hco+ ) suggesting that this part of the `` ring '' may be missing altogether .",
    "@xcite propose that the two bright lobes of the cnd are in fact _ distinct _ clouds on independent orbits around the nucleus and do not compose a single ring of gas .",
    "@xcite find kinematic evidence that the cnd is composed of at least three distinct clouds which are orbiting the black hole .",
    "in addition , the northern arm of the mini - spiral actually appears to originate outside the cnd and cross through on its way towards the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the idea that the cnd and the mini - spiral are composed of multiple distinct clouds under the gravitational influence of the nucleus easily explains the observed `` warping '' as well as the complex kinematics and clumpy morphology observed in the region @xcite .",
    "past observations of the central regions of the galaxy also provide insight into questions about the origin of the cnd and the clouds which compose it .",
    "if the cnd is composed of many distinct clouds , then it should be possible to trace where the clouds come from and determine the origin of the cnd .",
    "many attempts have been made to detect connections between two nearby giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and the cnd .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite detect a long filamentary `` streamer '' in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission that connects the `` 20 km s@xmath2 cloud '' ( m-0.130.08 , @xcite ) to the southeastern edge of the cnd .",
    "a small velocity gradient along this `` southern streamer '' as well as heating and increased line widths as the streamer approaches the galactic center indicate that gas is flowing from the 20 km s@xmath2 cloud towards the circumnuclear region .",
    "this connection has also been observed in hcn(3 - 2 ) @xcite , @xmath12co(2 - 1 ) @xcite and 1.1 mm dust @xcite .",
    "an extension of the 20 km s@xmath2 cloud towards the southwest lobe of the cnd was also seen in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) . due to the lack of pointings to the west of the cnd ,",
    "@xcite could not search for a connection between this extension and the cnd .",
    "however , the morphological connection between the 20 km s@xmath2 cloud and the southwest lobe of the cnd is observed in dust @xcite .",
    "other signs of connections between the gmcs and the cnd include a possible connection between the northeastern edge of the cnd and the `` 50 km s@xmath2 cloud '' ( m-0.030.07 , @xcite ) observed in hcn(1 - 0 ) @xcite .",
    "we present maps of the central 10 parsecs of the galaxy in the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) transitions of nh@xmath0 .",
    "unlike previous nh@xmath0 observations , our new data cover the entire velocity range seen in molecules at the galactic center and have improved spatial sampling which provide a more complete picture of nh@xmath0 in the central 10 pc of the galaxy and enable a more reliable comparison of nh@xmath0 emission to other tracers . with this data , we can probe the morphology and kinematics of all of the cnd as well as the surrounding molecular material .",
    "paper i focuses on the general morphology of velocity integrated nh@xmath0 emission from the region , including comparisons to hcn(1 - 0 ) , hcn(3 - 2 ) , 1.2 mm dust , and 6 cm continuum emission .",
    "new features to the north and west of the cnd are observed , producing a complete picture of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) emission in the central 10 parsecs .",
    "at least three physical connections between the gmcs and the cnd are observed , with kinematic information presented for these features .",
    "a detailed discussion of kinematics of the entire central 10 pc , including temperatures , opacities , and cloud masses , will be presented in a following paper .",
    "we observed the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) rotation inversion transitions of nh@xmath0 , at 23.694495 , 23.722633 , and 23.870129 ghz , respectively , with the national radio astronomy observatory s very large array ( vla ) telescope in 1999 march .",
    "observations were made in the d - northc array which provides the shortest baselines and the most circular synthesized beam possible for this low declination source ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a five - pointing mosaic was used to fully sample the central 4@xmath14 ( 10 pc ) of the galaxy .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the primary beam is 125@xmath3 at 23 ghz for the 25 m vla antennas . to ensure the field",
    "was properly sampled , one pointing was centered on sgr a * ( @xmath1517@xmath1645@xmath1740@xmath18 , @xmath19 ) while the other four pointings were offset by 1@xmath14 to the northeast , northwest , southeast , and southwest .",
    "at least one hour on source was obtained for each pointing at each frequency .",
    "the data consist of 31 channels with a width of 9.8 km s@xmath2 ( 0.78 mhz ) centered on a @xmath20 of 10.6 km s@xmath2 and covering @xmath21 km s@xmath2 .",
    "coil & ho ( 1999,2000 ) imaged the circumnuclear region in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) with a total velocity coverage of @xmath22 km s@xmath2 and a velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath2 . in their mosaics ,",
    "fields on the cnd were centered on @xmath23 km s@xmath2 while fields to the south and east of the cnd were centered on @xmath24 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the narrow velocity coverage excluded high velocity emission which is seen up to @xmath25  110 km s@xmath2 in the cnd .",
    "in addition , @xcite focused on the southern streamer and the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud and had no pointings to the north or west of the cnd .",
    "the images presented in this paper represent the first time that the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) transitions of nh@xmath0 have been fully sampled over the central 4@xmath14 with a velocity coverage that includes all of the emission from the cnd .",
    "each pointing was calibrated separately using nrao s astronomical imaging processing system ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "anomalously high @xmath27 points and large closure errors were removed .",
    "calibration of the amplitudes and phases were performed using 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ) and 1733130 . since sgr a * is a strong source at 23 ghz and within the primary beam of each pointing , self - calibration was successfully applied to each of the fields .",
    "the calibrator 1229 + 020 was used for bandpass calibration to correct instrumental phase offsets across the band and to remove the roll - off in sensitivity at the edge of the band .",
    "channels 1 , 30 , and 31 could not be fully corrected and were removed from the dataset resulting in a velocity coverage of 140 to + 130 km s@xmath2 .",
    "once the data were calibrated , line - free channels were used to model the continuum emission and remove it from the data .",
    "the fully calibrated , continuum - free data cubes were imaged in miriad @xcite , which offers superior tools for making mosaics and analyzing the spectral information .",
    "the five pointings were combined into a single mosaic in the @xmath27 plane . for the maps presented in this paper",
    ", we used the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to deconvolve the images .",
    "previous nh@xmath0 mosaics were deconvolved using the clean algorithm in which the field is assumed to be composed of points sources . as a result ,",
    "negative bowls surround bright extended features , possibly obscuring faint connections between clouds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mem is better suited to handle fields of extended emission and does not produce these negative bowls .",
    "however , mem does not conserve the integrated flux density in the map . to check our deconvolution , we deconvolved the data using both clean and mem .",
    "the two images agree on every main feature with the only difference in the low - level emission surrounding bright features .",
    "the integrated flux densities in both maps are also equal indicating that mem did not add substantial flux to the image . in order to recover the low - level emission in the map ,",
    "the mosaic was imaged using a gaussian taper applied to the @xmath27 data resulting in a synthesized beam of @xmath28 at a position angle of @xmath29 in all three maps .",
    "the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) velocity integrated ( 270 km s@xmath2 ) images are shown in figures [ 11.fig ] , [ 22.fig ] , and [ 33.fig ] . in all three images , the approximate location of the cnd @xcite is represented by two ellipses and the location of sgr a * is marked by a cross . if a straight summation of each channel map is used to create the velocity integrated image , emission from narrow - line features , which appear in only a small fraction of the channels , is diluted by the increased noise in the summed map . in order to avoid this problem and",
    "present a map showing all of the emission in the region , each channel map was clipped below @xmath30 before the channels were summed .",
    "this procedure was performed in aips using the iflux parameter in momnt .",
    "the resulting image had features on the size scale of single pixels as a result of the blanking process . to remove these artifacts ,",
    "the image was convolved with a gaussian beam with fwhm=@xmath31 .",
    "since the gaussian was significantly narrower than the image beam , the final beam size for our images was only slightly increased to @xmath32 .",
    "if the noise in one channel is known , then the noise in the velocity integrated image ( in jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 ) is simply @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of channels in the summation , @xmath35 is the channel width in km s@xmath2 , and @xmath36 is the noise in one channel . since the maps were clipped below @xmath37 in each channel , @xmath34 varies for each pixel in our maps .",
    "however , we assume most features show emission in @xmath38 of the channels and adopt @xmath39 , where @xmath40 km s@xmath2 and @xmath36 is measured in the individual channels .",
    "the resulting noise in our images is @xmath41 jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 , @xmath42 jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 , and @xmath43 jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 for the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) velocity integrated images , respectively . for features with emission in a very narrow velocity range ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) will be _ underestimated _ in our map by a factor of @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the true number of channels in which the feature appeared .",
    "thus , a feature with emission in only one channel will have @xmath46 and the s / n underestimated by a factor of 2.6 . the s / n of broad velocity features is _ overestimated _ in our images by a factor of @xmath47 and the s /",
    "n for a feature with emission in all channels is overestimated by a factor of 2 .",
    "there are few examples of these extremes in our data and the contours presented here are a reliable indicator of the significance of the detections .",
    "the additional complication in the noise analysis is well worth the benefits of being able to see all of the emission from the galactic center without losing narrow - line features due to the increased noise of a straight summed map .    for reference",
    ", we also present the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) channel maps in figure [ chan.fig ] .",
    "no clipping has been performed on these maps and the noise should be constant at all pixels ( ignoring any effect of mem deconvolution ) .",
    "the maps were not convolved by the @xmath48 gaussian beam and have a resolution of @xmath49 .",
    "narrow - line features such as the northern ridge are clearly visible .",
    "in addition to the velocity integrated images , a line ratio map of nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) emission is shown in figure [ temp.fig ] .",
    "line ratios of the nh@xmath0 transitions are reliable indicators of gas temperatures @xcite and can be helpful in understanding conditions near the galactic center . only points with nh@xmath0(1,1 ) emission @xmath50 and nh@xmath0(2,2 ) emission @xmath51 are included in the map , and the single contour marks a @xmath52 detection of nh@xmath0(2,2 ) emission .",
    "thus , regions _ inside _ this contour and with _ no _ greyscale were excluded on the basis of low nh@xmath0(1,1 ) brightness and may be very hot with high line ratios .",
    "gas at the location of the cnd is seen in all three velocity integrated images although it is best traced by nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) .",
    "nh@xmath0(3,3 ) is expected to be brighter than nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) by a factor of 2 due to a quantum mechanical degeneracy of the states in the ortho species of nh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the southern half of the cnd is much stronger in nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) than ( 1,1 ) and figure [ temp.fig ] shows the increased line ratio in the region .",
    "assuming the cnd is optically thin in nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) ( consistent with the results of @xcite ) , the observed ratio of nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) emission of 1.5 implies a rotational temperature of @xmath5350 k and a kinetic temperature of 60 k in the southeastern half of the cnd @xcite .",
    "this is hotter than material farther from the nucleus .",
    "emission to the south and east of the cnd has a typical line ratio @xmath54 indicating a rotational temperature of no more than @xmath55 k for gas more than 2 pc to the south or east of the galactic center    the nh@xmath0 images contain many long filamentary features which we refer to as streamers .",
    "the `` southern streamer '' @xcite , labeled in figure [ 33.fig ] , can be seen beginning at @xmath56 moving to the northeast to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and intersecting the cnd at @xmath59 .",
    "two clouds , previously observed by @xcite , are located to the east of the southern streamer and are labeled as `` se1 '' and `` se2 '' .",
    "these clouds appear to connect to the southern streamer in all three images .",
    "the bright , `` y''-shaped cloud in the northeast centered on @xmath60 is the `` 50 km s@xmath2 ''",
    "giant molecular cloud which is being impacted on the west by sgr a east ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "emission from se1 , se2 , and the southern streamer connect the 20 km s@xmath2 cloud in the south to the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud in the east .",
    "in fact , se2 is the southern half of the `` molecular ridge '' discussed by @xcite .",
    "the detection of se1 is a good example of the improved quality of our new images compared to previous nh@xmath0 mosaics .",
    "although the new data still show mainly filamentary structures , there are more faint connections between clouds than in previous images by @xcite .",
    "only faint emission was seen from se1 in @xcite , while we find this feature to be as strong as se2 .",
    "our ability to detect se1 reflects the lack of negative bowls near bright structures when mem is used to deconvolve the images , whereas only clean was used by @xcite . our improved spatial sampling and velocity coverage as well as",
    "the use of mem deconvolution has resulted in more robust nh@xmath0 images .    a new ridge of nh@xmath0(3,3 )",
    "emission is seen in figure [ 33.fig ] to the north of the cnd from @xmath61 , @xmath62 to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and lies along the northern edge of sgr a east . in the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 3,3 ) images , this `` northern ridge '' is connected to the cnd at @xmath65 , @xmath66 by a narrow streamer .",
    "the northern ridge was not in the field of view of the @xcite mosaic .",
    "finally , there is a long `` western streamer '' running approximately north - south from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "multiple faint connections between the western streamer and the cnd are seen at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and are discussed in more detail in section 5 .",
    "the large velocity coverage and uniform spatial sampling of our nh@xmath0 images present a unique opportunity to compare nh@xmath0 emission in the galactic center to emission from other tracers . in the following sections , nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) emission",
    "is compared to hcn(1 - 0 ) , hcn(3 - 2 ) , 1.2 mm dust , and 6 cm continuum emission .",
    "comparison of nh@xmath0(3,3 ) to hcn(@xmath751 - 0 ) has proved difficult with the two molecules apparently tracing different features at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "however , the images that were compared were often unevenly sampled or had very different velocity coverage and resolution .",
    "figure [ hcn.fig ] shows the velocity integrated nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) image in contours overlaid on a hcn(1 - 0 ) mosaic of the central 12.5 pc by @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) image has been convolved with a gaussian taper to a resolution of @xmath76 and the hcn(1 - 0 ) image has a resolution of @xmath77 .",
    "although the nh@xmath0 mosaic was made from vla data and the hcn(1 - 0 ) image was made from a 19-pointing bima mosaic , these two images are similar in their velocity and spatial coverage .",
    "the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) image is fully sampled out to 4@xmath14 with a velocity coverage of 140 km s@xmath2 to + 130 km s@xmath2 while the hcn(1 - 0 ) image is fully sampled out to 5@xmath14 and has a slightly broader velocity coverage of @xmath78 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the velocity resolution of the hcn(1 - 0 ) image is 5 km s@xmath2 whereas the nh@xmath0 resolution is 10 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the high quality of these two datasets enables the most robust comparison of emission from nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the ring - like structure of the cnd is clearly seen as the backwards `` c '' in the center of the hcn(1 - 0 ) image .",
    "both molecules show peaks in the northeast and southwest of the cnd , but the peaks are not in the same location . although the relative intensities differ , there is emission from both molecules around the entire ring except in the southeast where there is a conspicuous lack of emission .",
    "a narrow , north - south gap in the northern part of the cnd is observable in hcn(1 - 0 ) , and there is a distinct edge in the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission coincident with the edge of the gap . while the hcn(1 - 0 ) emission appears to have been pulled into a long filament at the gap ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 to @xmath81 ) , the nh@xmath0 does not appear to be as extended towards the north .",
    "however , the resolution of the nh@xmath0 maps makes it difficult to trace small scale features which can be seen in the hcn(1 - 0 ) image .",
    "this gap may be the result of the northern arm crossing through the cnd ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "kinematic information must be used to determine whether nh@xmath0(3,3 ) is tracing the same features of the cnd observed in hcn(1 - 0 ) .",
    "figure [ specpos ] shows the location of 12 spectra near the cnd .",
    "the corresponding spectra are shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "spectra a - j are at the same locations as the hcn(1 - 0 ) spectra in @xcite ; spectra k and l are located at two bright nh@xmath0 features .",
    "spectra for these two features were not shown in @xcite , but we include them here for comparison to nh@xmath0 .",

    "spectrum a is centered on sgr a*. hcn(1 - 0 ) shows significant absorption from known clouds along the line - of - sight ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nh@xmath0(3,3 ) shows some weak absorption at 0 km s@xmath2 , but also some emission near 40 km s@xmath2 .",
    "less absorption along the line - of - sight in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) is due to the low optical depth @xmath82 of nh@xmath0(3,3 ) compared to hcn(1 - 0 ) which is optically thick over most of the region @xcite .",

    "although the dip in the profile looks like it could be the result of self - absorption , position - velocity cuts in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) through the western side of the cnd indicate that this spectrum is the result of the superposition of two clouds along the line - of - sight . in the spectra that agree kinematically , the relative intensities of the lines are often different .",

    "while the hcn(1 - 0 ) emission peaks at 70 km s@xmath2 , we see the nh@xmath0 peak at @xmath83 km s@xmath2 . in @xcite , spectrum b",

    "absorption is seen at nearby positions from 60 to 80 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this absorption may affect spectrum b , causing the profile of this spectrum to have a sharp cut - off below 80 km s@xmath2 .",
    "if the low velocity emission has been absorbed , then the true distribution of hcn(1 - 0 ) emission may actually be centered at a lower velocity and agree with the peak velocity of 60 km s@xmath2 seen in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission .",
    "similar indications of absorption are seen in position velocity cuts of hcn(1 - 0 ) emission near spectra d and f. in hcn(1 - 0 ) , spectrum d appears to be affected by absorption at 60 km s@xmath2 ( see figure 13@xmath85 , position 20@xmath3 , @xcite ) .",

    ".    some of the brightest nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission from the cnd is seen in spectra k and l. there is little hcn(1 - 0 ) emission in k , while in l the hcn(1 - 0 ) is shifted to a higher velocity .",
    "the shift in l is similar to spectrum b which is near the same location in the cnd . in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) , both k and l have a very narrow profile in nh@xmath0 with a fwhm of @xmath86 km s@xmath2 .",

    "the general agreement of the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) spectra , especially when absorption along the line - of - sight and self - absorption are considered , shows that nh@xmath0(3,3 ) traces the main features of the cnd .",
    "the complex spectra in both molecules are an indication of the complicated gas kinematics in the cnd .",

    "the difference in relative intensity of nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) may be explained by opacity or a variety of chemical effects including evaporation of nh@xmath0 off of dust grains ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",

    "hcn(1 - 0 ) peaks to the north of the nh@xmath0 cloud with the strongest emission at the connection between the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud and the northern ridge at @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the most notable difference in this region of the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud is the `` hook '' of hcn(1 - 0 ) emission which extends past the edge of the nh@xmath0 emission to @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",

    "the southern streamer is weak in hcn(1 - 0 ) .",
    "there is almost no hcn(1 - 0 ) emission at the peak of the nh@xmath0 emission at @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "some hcn(1 - 0 ) emission is coincident with se1 and se2 , but the features are not as connected as in nh@xmath0 . the southern third of the western streamer is seen in both hcn(1 - 0 ) and nh@xmath0 .",
    "this feature is the high velocity ( 110 km s@xmath2 ) `` extension '' of the southwest lobe of the cnd seen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the northern two - thirds of the streamer may show some faint hcn(1 - 0 ) emission , but they do not form a single feature .",
    "the lack of hcn(1 - 0 ) emission from the brightest nh@xmath0(3,3 ) features is due in part to self - absorption of hcn(1 - 0 ) in the gmcs as well as absorption of hcn(1 - 0 ) along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "position - velocity cuts by @xcite along the southern streamer and 50 km s@xmath2 cloud ( see figure 13 in @xcite ) show strong self - absorption of hcn(1 - 0 ) in these features .",
    "self - absorption of hcn(1 - 0 ) could weaken the intensity of the gmcs and result in apparently enhanced emission from the cnd , where wide line widths make hcn(1 - 0 ) less susceptible to self - absorption .",
    "the nh@xmath0 is less affected by absorption because the transitions are of higher energies and are more optically thin than the hcn(1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "observations of the higher hcn ( @xmath753 - 2 ) transition by @xcite show good agreement with nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and support the idea that hcn(1 - 0 ) is highly affected by self - absorption and absorption along the line - of - sight .",
    "channel maps by @xcite of hcn(3 - 2 ) emission show strong emission at the location of both the 20 and 50 km s@xmath2 clouds in addition to the cnd ( see figure 2 , @xcite ) .",

    "the extension of the 20 km s@xmath2 cloud towards the southwestern lobe of the cnd , seen at @xmath71 , @xmath93 in figure [ 33.fig ] , is observed at 10 km s@xmath2 .",
    "emission from the southern streamer is seen in the 30 km s@xmath2 channel and is just as strong as emission from the cnd .",
    "the 50 km s@xmath2 and 20 km s@xmath2 gmcs also dominate the channel maps that correspond to their central velocities .",
    "the northern ridge is easily observable in hcn(3 - 2 ) as the ridge to the north of the cnd in the 10 km s@xmath2 channel of @xcite . in conclusion , the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and hcn(3 - 2 ) images agree on every main feature including the southern streamer , northern ridge , and western streamer which are completely absent in the hcn(1 - 0 ) image .",
    "this indicates that images made with hcn(1 - 0 ) must be carefully studied to determine the effects of absorption and excitation .",
    "the colorscale in figure [ pbcor ] shows a 1.2 mm continuum image taken by @xcite using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "this 1.2 mm image traces thermal dust emission in the region with additional free - free emission in the mini - spiral .",
    "overlaid on the continuum emission is a primary beam corrected nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) velocity integrated map .",
    "the primary beam correction was performed by dividing the velocity integrated ( 3,3 ) emission by the gain of the interferometer at each point in the map .",
    "only points with a gain @xmath9415% are plotted in figure [ pbcor ] .",
    "primary beam correction results in a map with varying noise characteristics across the field .",
    "although the rms noise of this image near the field center is still @xmath530.33 jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 , the noise is scaled up by the reciprocal of the gain and is @xmath532.2 jy beam@xmath2 km s@xmath2 at the map edge .",

    "this feature is clearly present in the dust image from @xmath63 , @xmath98 to @xmath87 , @xmath99 where it intersects the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud .",
    "both tracers show little or no emission in the northwest quadrant of the image .",
    "there is also a lack of nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and thermal dust emission in the cavity of sgr a east covering @xmath100 to @xmath63 and @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "the degree of correlation between nh@xmath0 and dust emission in the cnd is difficult to determine due to the free - free emission that dominates the dust image near sgr a west .",
    "comparison of the 1.2 mm dust map to a 350 @xmath103 m map by @xcite shows that the dust emission is approximately constant over this wavelength range .",
    "the similarity of the two maps implies that the 1.2 mm dust traces column density and is not strongly correlated with temperature in the region .",
    "the dust image has a beam size of @xmath5311@xmath3 , and as a single dish map it detects highly extended emission . considering the lack of zero - spacing information in the nh@xmath0 data ( shortest baseline 35 m ) , the agreement between the two maps is compelling , suggesting that nh@xmath0 is a relatively unbiased tracer of column density in the galactic center region .    a few features seen in the nh@xmath0(3,3 )",
    "image are not observed in the thermal dust image .",
    "the `` western streamer '' is not strongly correlated with the dust , and there is almost no dust emission in the upper two - thirds of this streamer .",
    "line ratios of more than 1 in this region ( see figure [ temp.fig ] ) indicate that the western streamer is heated to @xmath104 k. the narrow stream of gas connecting the northern ridge to the cnd is also not strongly correlated with the dust and shows similar hints of high line ratios in figure [ temp.fig ] .",
    "the heating and absence of dust in these features indicate that they may be located physically closer to sgr a * or may originate in a different way than the streamers that contain dust .",
    "the velocity integrated nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) emission is overlaid on 6 cm continuum emission @xcite in figure [ sgeast.fig ] .",
    "the arms of the sgr a west mini - spiral can be seen in blue in the center of the image .",
    "the eastern edge of sgr a east extends to @xmath105 and the western edge is spatially coincident with the western edge of the cnd and mini - spiral .",
    "sgr a east is expanding with an energy more than an order of magnitude greater than a typical supernova remnant @xcite . the nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 )",
    "emission closely follows the outer edge of sgr a east .",
    "the shell is impacting the 50 km s@xmath2 cloud in the east @xcite where material forms a `` ridge '' on the western edge of the cloud .",
    "this ridge is seen in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) from @xmath97 , @xmath90 to @xmath87 , @xmath98 .",
    "the northern ridge and western streamer also lie along the outside edge of sgr a east .",
    "therefore , it appears that sgr a east is expanding into material on all sides of the cnd .",
    "we observe multiple connections between the cnd and the ridges on the outside edge of sgr a east ( see section 5 ) .",
    "these connections are a strong indication that the cnd and sgr a east are in close proximity to each other .",
    "the southern edge of sgr a east is approximately coincident with the two southern clouds and the southern streamer . since the `` 20 km",
    "s@xmath2 '' giant molecular cloud ( which appears to be the source of at least the southern streamer @xcite ) is thought to be located in front of sgr a east @xcite , sgr a east may be expanding into the back of these filaments .",
    "in addition , there is evidence that a snr centered at @xmath106 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) may be impacting sgr a east along its southeastern edge .",
    "this could account for the 1720 mhz oh masers detected by @xcite on the boundary between this snr and sgr a east .",
    "the interaction of these two expanding shells could also produce filamentary structures like se1 , se2 , and the southern streamer .",
    "figure [ sgeast.fig ] is also useful for studying the gap in nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) emission in the northern part of the cnd at the location of the northern arm of the mini - spiral .",
    "as discussed in section 4.1 , this gap is also seen in hcn ( 1 - 0 ) emission . the lack of nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) emission in addition to the lack of hcn(1 - 0 ) emission and the observation of 1720 oh masers in this gap supports the idea that the northern arm of the mini - spiral originates outside the cnd and is crossing over or through the cnd on its way to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "connections between the cnd and features at larger distances such as the 20 and 50 km s@xmath2 cloud can provide an explanation for the origin of the clouds that compose the cnd",
    ". a connection must show more than morphological evidence to be considered a physical gas flow .",
    "the presence of a velocity gradient along a streamer indicates that the gas is being gravitationally affected by the central gravitational field .",
    "line ratios can also determine whether gas is heated as it approaches the nucleus , thus providing a way to discriminate against chance projections of clouds along the line - of - sight .",
    "finally , as the gas intersects clouds in the cnd , the line widths should broaden .",
    "streamers with these qualities are likely candidates for flows along which gas is transported towards the galactic center .",
    "we detect at least three physical connections between the cnd and gas at larger distances .",
    "these connections originate in the southern streamer , se1 , the northern ridge , and the western streamer and may represent inflow of material towards the nucleus .",
    "figure [ pvpos ] shows the position of six position - velocity cuts along features which appear to be connecting the material to the cnd overlaid on nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission .",
    "the position velocity diagrams for nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) are shown in figures [ 11pv ] , [ 22pv ] , and [ pv ] . in each cut , position `` 0 '' corresponds to the labeled end of the cut .    in the velocity integrated images ,",
    "the brightest emission is at 30 - 50 km s@xmath2 mainly from the large gmcs . when performing mem deconvolution , channels with bright emission may have `` blooming '' where plateaus of low - level flux are added around strong features .",
    "artifacts of blooming were seen in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) position - velocity diagrams as narrow lines centered at @xmath83 km s@xmath2 seen along most of the cut . to test the effects of blooming , we created cleaned data cubes .",
    "the bright emission is identical in both diagrams , but the narrow ridges centered at 45 km s@xmath2 disappear in the cleaned diagrams . to be conservative ,",

    "in addition , the line is seen to broaden dramatically when the gas reaches the cnd . at a position of 90 - 100@xmath3 ,",
    "nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission is seen over a velocity range of almost 100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this broadening is also seen in nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and to a lesser degree in nh@xmath0(1,1 ) .",
    "the peak of the emission is located at @xmath55 km s@xmath2 while broadening is seen in the lowest contours .",
    "the broadening in all three transitions seems to be biased towards lower velocities and ranges from 70 to + 50 km s@xmath2 instead of being symmetric on both sides of the line center .",
    "an increase in the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) line ratio as the streamer approaches the cnd can be seen in figure [ temp.fig ] and indicates that gas is being heated as it approaches the nucleus .",
    "this heating could result from shocks as the gas merges with the cnd or from high - energy photons escaping from the nuclear region .",
    "the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) hyperfine satellite components may be seen bracketing the strong central component .",
    "asymmetric broadening of the main component may explain why the satellite lines do not appear to have equal intensity on both sides of the main component in position - velocity cut @xmath107 .",
    "in figure [ pv]@xmath107 , nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission at 30 km s@xmath2 and 110@xmath3 to 140@xmath3 appears to come from inside the cnd .",

    "this abrupt end is used by @xcite as evidence that the southern streamer is interacting with the cnd .",

    "gas in the northern ridge at a position of 30@xmath3 has a velocity of 10 km s@xmath2 and connects to the cnd with a smooth velocity gradient of 0.6 km s@xmath2arcsec@xmath2 .",

    "position velocity cuts in nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) show the same kinematic signature for this streamer connecting the northern ridge to the cnd .",
    "the positive velocity increase as the gas approaches the cnd places the northern ridge in front of the northeastern part of the cnd .",
    "in addition , the low velocity of this streamer ( @xmath109 km s@xmath2 ) makes it likely to be gravitationally bound by the nucleus .",
    "since the velocity increases as projected distance decreases , we can eliminate a circular orbit for this cloud .",
    "the northern ridge has high nh@xmath0(2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) line ratios and may have been impacted and disrupted by sgr a east ( see section 4.3 ) .",

    "this ratio increases to @xmath112 where the streamer intersects the cnd ( position 140@xmath3 ) . assuming that the streamer is optically thin along its entire length , this increase in nh@xmath0(2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) line ratios corresponds to a temperature increase from @xmath113 k to @xmath55 k.    although the upper part of the northern ridge is well traced in dust , there is little dust emission along the connection to the cnd ( see figure [ pbcor ] ) .",

    "the independence of this feature from the rest of the cnd would also account for the different inclination angles observed for the two halves of the cnd .",

    "<S> new vla images of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) emission in the central 10 parsecs of the galaxy trace filamentary streams of gas , several of which appear to feed the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nh@xmath0 images have a spatial resolution of @xmath1 and have better spatial sampling than previous nh@xmath0 observations . </S>",
    "<S> the images show the `` southern streamer , '' `` 50 km s@xmath2 cloud , '' and new features including a `` western streamer '' , 6 parsecs in length , and a `` northern ridge '' which connects to the cnd . </S>",
    "<S> nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission is very similar to 1.2 mm dust emission indicating that nh@xmath0 traces column density well </S>",
    "<S> . ratios of the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) line intensities give an estimate of the temperature of the gas and indicate high temperatures close to the nucleus and cnd . </S>",
    "<S> the new data cover a velocity range of 270 km s@xmath2 , including all velocities observed in the cnd , with a resolution of 9.8 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> previous nh@xmath0 observations with higher resolution did not cover the entire range of velocities seen in the cnd . </S>",
    "<S> the large - scale kinematics of the cnd do not resemble a coherent ring or disk . </S>",
    "<S> we see evidence for a high velocity cloud within a projected distance of 50@xmath3 ( 2 pc ) which is only seen in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) and is likely to be hot . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to 6 cm continuum emission reveals that much of the nh@xmath0 emission traces the outer edges of sgr a east and was probably pushed outward by this expanding shell . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the northern ridge ( which appears to be swept up by sgr a east ) and the cnd indicates that sgr a east and the cnd are in close proximity to each other . </S>",
    "<S> kinematic evidence for these connections is presented in this paper , while the full kinematic analysis of the central 10 pc will be presented in paper ii . </S>"
