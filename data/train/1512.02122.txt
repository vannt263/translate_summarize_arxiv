    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the transient emission properties of such sources include comparatively minor recurrent soft @xmath0-ray bursts ( @xmath4 erg ) and sporadic giant @xmath0-ray flares ( @xmath5 erg ) . at present , three giant flares have been observed from independent sources and their lightcurves exhibit remarkably similar characteristics ( see figure  [ fig : lcurve ] in section [ sec : et ] ) .",
    "giant flares are typically composed of an explosive initial hard @xmath0-ray spike ( @xmath6 kev ) that develops within ( sub)milliseconds and lasts a mere fraction of a second ( @xmath7 s ) , and a quasi - exponentially abating x - ray tail ( @xmath8 kev ) that persists for minutes , with superimposed pulsations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the emission of the decaying tail is argued to be the result of a continuously evaporating and locally magnetically trapped thermal photon - pair fireball . beamed emission from this moves in and out the line of sight , due to the rotation of the underlying ns @xcite .",
    "the physical process behind the onset , the trigger mechanism , that would clarify the impulsive phase of these energetic flares , remains however a topic of great debate . here",
    "we will discuss one such mechanism , spontaneous tearing of a globally extended equatorial current sheet , in more detail .",
    "typical emission timescales of the observed giant flares play a critical role in resolving this dispute .      in this section",
    "we briefly explore the various magnetar giant flare trigger mechanisms that have been proposed .",
    "we begin with the setup of the system prior to the explosive event and proceed with the triggers , subdivided in internal and external mechanisms .",
    "the origin of the strong magnetic field is a non - trivial affair . @xcite",
    "have argued that during the transient phase of extensive neutrino cooling moments after gravitational collapse of the progenitor star , entropy - driven convection and differential rotation inside a rapidly spinning ( initial spin period : @xmath9 ms ) proto - ns may sustain an efficient @xmath10-@xmath11 dynamo which could generate an internal magnetic field up to @xmath12 g. alternatively , the massive progenitor may already accommodate a sizeable magnetic field . an ultra - strong field is consequently formed via straightforward flux conservation of the fossil field during implosion @xcite .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the newly formed ultra - strong field is only seconds or less , and the crystallisation of the outer layer does not set in for another couple of minutes to hours .",
    "this allows the field to evolve readily towards a ( meta-)stable magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) equilibrium configuration , likely consisting of a combination of a poloidal- and toroidal component , before its further evolution is constrained by the presence of a highly conductive solid crust @xcite .",
    "the problem of magnetic - field stability , and the respective strengths of the two field components have been studied by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "no consensus has been reached on these matters yet , and further investigations including the effects of superconductivity @xcite and the ns crust @xcite are required to advance the issue .",
    "subsequent evolution of the strongly twisted field is then determined by ambipolar diffusion , ohmic decay , and ( non - diffusive ) hall drift which occur throughout the interior of the ns ( crust and core ) and operate on much longer timescales @xmath13 yr @xcite .",
    "the conductive crust either severely resists the imparted motion of the frozen - in magnetic flux tubes such that maxwell stress builds up continuously in the system or allows for a constrained transport of magnetic helicity into the magnetosphere , which in turn may develop into a sheared configuration .",
    "a reservoir of energy grows ( internally or externally ) until a certain critical threshold is reached , suddenly releasing the energy in an explosive manner through e.g. a crustal failure or mhd instability of the magnetic field .      motivated by the duration of the impulsive phase ( @xmath14 s ) @xcite initially proposed an internal trigger mechanism whereby a large - scale interchange instability , i.e. a global mhd rearrangement , would take place in the liquid core of the ns and propagate outward on a dynamical timescale , equal to the internal alfvn crossing time , @xmath15 where @xmath16 cm is the typical radius of a ns and @xmath17 cm s@xmath18 is the core alfvn speed for a density @xmath19 g @xmath20 with the core magnetic field strength given by @xmath21 g. this results in a sudden global displacement of the magnetic footpoints on the surface of the star injecting an ` alfvn pulse ' into the magnetosphere , which subsequently induces a relativistic outflow of plasma .",
    "the ( sub)millisecond rise of the giant flare lightcurve is , they argue , the signature of a reconnection front in the magnetosphere leading the relativistic outflow , which in turn develops on the external alfvn crossing time , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetospheric alfvn speed .",
    "therefore , even though we initially observe the emission from the reconnection front , the trigger nevertheless is given by the onset of the internal instability .",
    "a second trigger mechanism introduced by @xcite involves the force balance between the rigidity of the elastic ns crust and vast magnetic shear - stress , imparted through the anchored magnetic field lines - ray bursts from magnetars . ] .",
    "ultimately , the tension of the strongly twisted magnetic field in the crust will become the dominant force and drive the crustal lattice beyond its critical straining threshold @xmath24 .",
    "as the crust yields , the suppressed magnetic energy is allegedly liberated abruptly through a propagating fracture  analogous to an earthquake  producing seismic modes , which in turn couple to magnetospheric alfvn modes via the pinned magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite note however that the storage capacity of elastic energy in the crust @xmath25 which depends on its critical yield strain , is insufficient to explain the observed output power of a giant flare ( @xmath26 erg ) .",
    "accordingly , they argued that the crust merely functions as a gate that assists in the storage and discharge of the internal magnetic energy , rather than as the main energy reservoir .",
    "it is important to remark however that they assumed conservatively @xmath27 , yet this value has since been revised by @xcite through molecular dynamics simulations to be @xmath28 ( this value has been independently reproduced by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this",
    "we obtain @xmath29 erg [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : crust energy ] ) ] , which is comparable to the total energy output of the giant flares .",
    "note however that the value for the critical breaking strain decreases significantly , due to defects induced in the crust after the first time it yields @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite argue that even a moderate breaking strain of @xmath30 and a fracture extending to the base of the crust can power the most energetic giant flare to date .    due to the large hydrostatic pressure in the ns crust @xmath31 in comparison to the shear modulus @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , it is impossible to create a long - lived void necessary for a brittle fracture to occur @xcite , regardless of the magnitude of the imparted maxwell stress . when the crust yields it does not crack , yet rather undergoes a gradual plastic deformation in response to the imparted lorentz forces , whereby internal currents and associated magnetic helicity are transported outward into the less conductive magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the presence of a strong magnetic field reinforces the crust , which might strongly impede the formation of a propagating fracture or global slip , altogether . only under certain specific conditions , where the magnetic flux surface is oriented almost perfectly perpendicular to the direction of shear ( within @xmath34 radian ) ,",
    "can enough energy be released through a propagating fracture to explain the observed emission .",
    "an important challenge for trigger mechanisms that manifest internally , either a core mhd instability or crustal failure , is the significant impedance mismatch between the internal and external alfvn velocities @xcite . as a result , magnetic energy that dissipates through shear waves",
    "can not be transmitted to the magnetosphere fast enough to explain the ( sub)millisecond rise of the initial transient phase of the giant flare . instead",
    ", shear waves get reflected numerous times prior to leaving the stellar interior , extending the outward transmission time considerably .",
    "the aforementioned issues with internal triggers have led to the notion that prior to a giant flare the magnetic energy might be stored in the magnetosphere , rather than in the interior of the ns .",
    "@xcite argue that the tightly wound internal magnetic field induces a strong current that in turn closes through a thin surface layer .",
    "this local surface layer will experience a lorentz force , which causes the crust to rotate plastically . anchored magnetic field lines",
    "are dragged along with the gyrating motion and a twist is gradually imparted to the external magnetic field .",
    "the twist supporting currents can be composed by charges stripped from the ns surface or  more likely  by pair creation in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the non - potential external field reacts to the new boundary conditions and evolves through a series of quasi - equilibria , continuously twisting the external field either locally @xcite or globally @xcite .",
    "a local increase of helicity leads to the formation of a helically twisted flux rope embedded in the magnetar magnetosphere , whereby the impulsive phase of the giant flare is associated with an abrupt loss of equilibrium and subsequent catastrophic destabilisation of the flux rope , analogous to the dynamics of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a global accumulation of twist may cause the external field to eventually expand outwards , becoming increasingly radial , and admitting a cusp - shaped or y - type neutral line topology , characterised by a narrow equatorial current sheet where the magnetic shear is most significant @xcite . in this narrow",
    "yet extended neutral layer the gradients become significant and the mhd approximation breaks down allowing for the field lines to diffuse through the plasma .",
    "the onset of the flare is then given by an explosive reconnection event , which may roughly develop on the external alfvn crossing time @xmath35 ms [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ext .",
    "alfven cross time ] ) ] @xcite , and the expulsion of a relativistic plasmoid . in this paper",
    "we investigate specifically the reconnection process in the latter configuration  illustrated in figure [ fig : mag_sphere1 ] .",
    "both magnetospheric models provide a mechanism for slow build up of an energy reservoir over tens of years caused by the ambipolar diffusion of the internal magnetic field and its subsequent rapid conversion into bulk kinetic energy , particle acceleration , and radiation ( @xmath36 milliseconds ) . observed spectral hardening ( softening ) and an increase ( decrease ) in spin down in the pre ( post ) giant flare stage of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 22 @xcite are consistent with an increase ( decrease ) of twist and charge density in the external field @xcite .",
    "moreover , a considerable reduction in harmonic content of the pulse profile of sgr 1900 + 14 during and following the giant flare suggests a burst mechanism which reduced the twist of the external field significantly @xcite .",
    "distinct reconnection models have been introduced to describe the initial transient phase of the observed giant flares . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest the development of the tearing instability in a relativistic force - free current sheet as the trigger mechanism .",
    "they argue that the minimum growth time of the linear tearing mode accords with the ( sub)millisecond rise ( to peak ) of the giant flares .",
    "alternatively , @xcite propose a fast reconnection model that relies on collisionless hall reconnection ( @xmath37 ms ) and ascribes a crucial role to the soft precursors ( @xmath38 erg , @xmath39 kev ) that have been observed before the last two giant flares kev . ] .",
    "these precursors facilitate the conditions for collisionless hall reconnection by introducing a baryon contaminant in the pair dominated magnetosphere , since the former process relies on the hall effect which in turn requires a non - mass - symmetric plasma composition to operate .",
    "+   + in this article we focus on magnetospheric giant flare trigger mechanisms .",
    "in particular we critically analyse the most discussed candidate reconnection mechanism , i.e. impulsive reconnection through the spontaneous development of the tearing instability in a globally sheared external field .",
    "component of the globally twisted magnetic field surrounding the neutron star may act as a guide field in the case of an equatorial current sheet . ]",
    "we revise the tearing mode growth time as applied to magnetar magnetospheres by @xcite and expand on the rectified result .",
    "characteristic timescales appearing in the giant flare lightcurves have hereby provided necessary constraints .",
    "furthermore , we provide order of magnitude estimates related to the geometry of the reconnection region and discuss the validity of basic assumptions regarding this trigger mechanism .    in section [ sec :",
    "et ] we review typical timescales of the observed giant flare emission and additional relevant data of the phenomena involved . in section [ sec : tmt ] we summarise previous works on the dynamics behind the relativistic tearing instability and the general expression for its minimum growth time .",
    "subsequently we show that a revised version of the tearing mode growth time for magnetar magnetospheres can in principle explain the ( sub)millisecond rise times of giant flares under certain conditions , pertaining to the geometry of the reconnection region . in section [ sec : pcotrr ] , using straightforward theoretical models that rely on the tearing mode timescale , we constrain the height of the reconnection region and thickness of the current sheet in which the tearing mode develops . in section [ sec : ep ] we discuss the relations between the mhd growth time and the radiative timescale , which is directly connected with the observed lightcurve . throughout the article we adopt a gaussian - cgs unit system in our calculations .",
    "currently , three magnetars have produced a giant @xmath0-ray flare . in chronological order they are the 1979 march 5 flare from sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite , the 1998 august 27 flare from sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , and the 2004 december 27 flare from sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite .",
    "the energy in radiation emitted during the decaying tail was roughly equal for the three giant flares ( @xmath40 erg ) , indicating that the strength of the confining magnetospheric field , which traps the photon - pair fireball , is roughly similar for the three sources since the energy storage capacity of the field is related to its strength @xcite .",
    "the inferred surface dipole magnetic field strengths @xmath41 of the sources are given in table [ tab : gf data ] .",
    "the released photon energy during the initial spike was however considerably larger for the most recent giant flare ( @xmath42 erg ) , as compared to the first two ( @xmath43 erg ) .",
    "considering the fact that the duration of the hard spike is roughly three orders of magnitude less than the soft tail , it is rather astonishing that the photon energy output of the hard spike is approximately equal to or even much greater than the energy released during the decay of the soft tail .",
    "the conversion of such a vast amount of stored magnetic energy into high energy radiation in a considerably limited window of time , requires an extraordinary trigger mechanism indeed , which accordingly may be constrained by the observed photon flux and associated sub(milli)second rise time .",
