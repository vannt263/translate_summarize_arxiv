    "the magnetotail current sheet is one of the key topics in magnetospheric physics .",
    "observations of the current sheet have revealed a very complex structure . at the end of april 2 , 1978 ,",
    "the isee-1/2 spacecraft detected a flapping of the plasma sheet and the spacecraft crossed the central region more than 10 times in a hour .",
    "in particular , during a `` turbulent '' crossing , the spacecraft detected current concentration outside the central region , unlike the harris current sheet [ _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ] .",
    "in fact , geotail [ _ kokobun et al . _ , 1994 ; _ mukai et al . _ , 1994 ] averaged data obtained from october 1993 to june 1995 show that the structure of the plasma sheet can be often approximated by a double - peaked electric current sheet [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] and observations made by the same spacecraft during a substorm on 23 april 1996 lead to a similar conclusion [ _ asano et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "on january 14 , 1994 , geotail also detected multiple double - peaked current sheet crossings , associated with plasma flow [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] .",
    "more recently , time analysis of data from the four cluster spacecrafts [ _ balogh et al . _ ,",
    "2001 ] showed that fast motion and bifurcation of the current sheet are associated with a wave - like transient propagating in the dawn - to - dusk direction [ _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ runov et al . _ ,",
    "plasma flow has also been observed during a substorm event [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; _ ieroset et al . _ , 2001 ; _ asano et al .",

    "these observations refer both to the distant magnetotail ( @xmath0 ) [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] and to a region closer to earth ( @xmath1 ) [ _ sergeev et al .",

    "_ , 2003 ]    a useful but simple one - dimensional description of the current sheet is given by the harris model , where the magnetic field is given by @xmath2 and the plasma density , proportional to the current density , is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the half thickness of the current sheet and the gsm coordinates are used .",
    "generalizations of the standard harris current sheet equilibrium have been recently proposed to reproduce the bifurcation observed by satellites [ _ shindler and birn _ , 2002 ; _ sitnov et al . _ ,",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] propose that bifurcation and flapping signatures are due to a kink or a sausage instability of a current sheet with an enhanced current density on both hemispheres .",
    "et al . _ [ 2002 ] show that non - adiabatic effects can reduce the current density in the center of the current sheet",
    ". a bifurcated current sheet can be present in the plasma outflow region when magnetic reconnection is occurring [ e.g. , _ arzner and sholer _",
    "[ 2003a , 2003b ] argue that the ion - ion kink instability causes a displacement of the current sheet which can explain the flapping observations and interpret the bifurcated structure of the current sheet as a magnetic field profile with weak central gradient due to the non - linear evolution of the kink instability .",
    "generally , plasma flow is explained in terms of plasma out - flowing from a reconnection region .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze the results of a three - dimensional kinetic simulation of the harris current sheet by introducing diagnostic tools very similar to the one used by satellite .",
    "we show that the self - consistent evolution of the current sheet dispalyed by the simulations can be responsible for the data observed by the satellites described in the references above . in particular , taking into account the relative motion of the current sheet and the spacecraft , and the cluster tetrahedron configuration",
    ", we recover the most significant magnetic data records obtained by the cluster spacecraft as the signature of current sheet flapping .",
    "the recurrence frequency of the magnetic field @xmath5 allow the comparison with observations by geotail [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] that show current bifurcation , and the magnetic field structure show the signature of bifurcation recovered in single crossing .",
    "we also compare the plasma flow due to the tearing instability with the observations .",
    "in our study , we use the implicit pic code celeste3d [ _ forslund and brackbill _ , 1985 ; _ vu and brackbill _ , 1992 ; _ ricci et al .",
    "_ , 2002a ] , which is particularly suitable for large scale and long period kinetic simulations performed with high mass ratio and has been applied previously to problems in magnetospheric physics [ e.g. , _ lapenta and brackbill _ , 2000 ; _ lapenta and brackbill _ , 2002 ; _ ricci et al .",
    "_ , 2002b ; _ lapenta et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "we use the same plasma parameters as the gem challenge [ _ birn et al . _ , 2001 ] .",
    "in particular we start from a standard harris current sheet , with magnetic field given by @xmath6 , density by @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the ion drift velocity is @xmath10 , and a background population @xmath11 . unlike the gem challenge , we do not add any initial perturbation and let the system evolve on its own .",
    "the dimensions of the system are @xmath12 \\times [ -l_y/2 , l_y/2 ] \\times [ -l_z/2 , l_z/2]$ ] with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , discretized with a grid @xmath16 .",
    "the boundary conditions are perfect conductors at @xmath17 and periodic boundaries in all the other directions .",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath18 .",
    "the parameters chosen make the current sheet particularly unstable and its dynamics are accelerated compared with typical magnetotail current sheets .",
    "we are constrained to do that in order to follow the dynamics of the current sheet in a reasonable computational time . as a consequence",
    ", it is necessary to scale our results to make a quantitative comparison between simulation results and observations . in any case , the general trends can be located and the linear theory [ _ karimabadi et al . _ , 2003a ] can help in scaling the results .",
    "previous simulations [ _ lapenta and brackbill _ , 2002 ; _ lapenta et al . _ , 2003 ; _ daughton _ , 2003 ] performed in the current aligned plane show , in absence of a plasma background , the development of the fastest lower - hybrid drift instability on the electron gyroscale , followed by electromagnetic modes with wavelengths intermediate between the ion and the electron gyroscale .",
    "the lower hybrid drift instability causes a velocity shear ( present since the beginning of the simulation when a background plasma is present ) that triggers a kelvin - helmhotz ( kh ) instability that kinks the current sheet . as we add a background population ,",
    "following karimabadi _",
    "[ 2003b ] , the velocity shear is present since the beginning of the simulation and the resulting kh instability can be also interpreted as a kinetic ion - ion kink instability [ _ karimabadi et al .",
    "_ , 2003a ; _ karimabadi",
    "_ , 2003b ] .",
    "both the present and previous simulations have shown that with the kinking of the current sheet a tearing instability grows [ _ lapenta and brackbill _ , 2001 ; _ lapenta et al . _ ,",
    "2003 ] . in the present case , the fastest short wavelength modes grow ( corresponding to @xmath19 or @xmath20 in our simulation box ) , and then they merge to form a single island tearing mode that involve the whole domain .",
    "below we consider specific aspects of the satellite observations basing their interpretation on the simulation .",
    "when vertical oscillations of the plasma sheet ( flapping ) occur , spacecrafts may repeatedly cross the current sheet .",
    "clear evidence of current sheet flapping is shown by isee-1/2 [ _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] , by geotail [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] , and by cluster [ _ runov et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "we focus our attention on the observations by cluster and show that current sheet kinking developed in the course of our simulations can explain those .",
    "figure 1 shows fully developed current sheet kinking .",
    "the @xmath5 field is shown .",
    "the wavelength is @xmath21 , which matches fairly well the observed wavelength in runov _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the linear theory predicts a decrease of the wavelength when @xmath23 increases [ _ karimabadi et al .",
    "_ , 2003a ] consistent with the fact that our thickness is likely smaller than the observation .",
    "the amplitude @xmath24 at time @xmath25 is @xmath26 is comparable to the observed value ( @xmath27 ) [ _ sergeev et al . _ , 2003 ] .",
    "the flapping motion observed by cluster moving duskward at @xmath28 km / s , corresponding to approximatively @xmath29 .",
    "the kink instability shown in our simulations gives a @xmath30 , larger than observed in space .",
    "however , the linear theory predicts a decrease of the phase velocity when @xmath23 increases . since we use an artificially high @xmath23 , the higher phase speed is justified and consistent with our interpretation of the flapping motion .    in fig .",
    "2a we show cluster @xmath31 and @xmath32 observations taken on 29 august 2001 , which have been analyzed previously by runov _",
    "_ [ 2003 ] .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5 data is considered . in fig .",
    "3a , we evaluate the magnetic field as a function of time as would be recorded by a virtual spacecraft placed in the environment provided by the simulation . according to the real spacecraft disposition , we impose a distance between the two virtual satellites in the @xmath33 direction to be of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "cluster observes an oscillation period of @xmath35s and a relative velocity between satellite and plasma @xmath36 . in order to decrease the time necessary for the observation",
    ", we increase the relative satellite velocity up to @xmath37 , thus decreasing the oscillation period to @xmath38 , in good agreement with the oscillation period recorded by cluster . with the new relative velocity and using the fact that @xmath39 in the magnetotail and the observed period is of the order @xmath40 , the observed wavelength , @xmath41 and the simulated wavelength , @xmath42 , are comparable .",
    "the flapping observation recorded by cluster @xmath32 on september 26 , 2001 and described by sergeev _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] is shown in fig .",
    "it is reproduced by our simulations at later times , when the amplitude of the kink has grown enough that the virtual satellite can pass from one side to the other of the current sheet .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "we note that cluster observations reveal a flattening of the current sheet in the vicinity of the points where @xmath43 , which is associated to current sheet bifurcation .",
    "the grid spacing used in the three - dimensional simulation does not allow to resolve this structure , which is better addressed in more resolved two - dimensional simulations .    in agreement with sergeev _",
    "_ [ 2003 ] and runov _ et al . _ [ 2003 ] , our simulations reveal that the current sheet flapping is mostly in the @xmath44 plane , while the tilt in the @xmath45 plane is insignificant .",
    "experimental evidence exists that the current distribution in the magnetotail sheet may be double - peaked , with a pair of electric current sheets separated by a layer of a weak quasi - uniform magnetic field .",
    "current sheet bifurcation has been revealed both in averages over a number of current sheet crossings , and in single sheet crossings .",
    "the statistical studies of the current sheet presented in hoshino _",
    "et al . _ [ 1996 ] reveal a bifurcated current profile .",
    "an ensemble of neutral sheet crossings is considered and the occurrence frequency of @xmath5 is evaluated .",
    "the observed distribution has a peak around the null magnetic region , as in sergeev _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] .",
    "the distribution of occurrence of the field @xmath5 , @xmath46 can be expressed as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the functional form of the magnetic field as a function of @xmath33 can be obtained , and from the gradient of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath33 it is possible to evaluate the plasma current .",
    "the whole procedure is able to smear out current sheet flapping and particular motion of the current sheet .    in order to study current bifurcation ,",
    "we have performed a two - dimensional simulation in the @xmath44 plane that allows to use a more refined grid in this plane ( @xmath49 ) . in fig .",
    "4a we show the plot of in - plane current @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "although the high fluctuations , the simulation show an increase of the current on the flanks of the current sheet .",
    "to follow geotail data analysis , we compute the recurrence frequency of @xmath5 ( fig 4b ) .",
    "the occurrence frequency shows a peak around @xmath43 , as satellite data show [ _ hoshino et al . _ , 1996 ( fig.2 ) , _ sergeev et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ( fig .",
    "4 ) ] . by integrating eq . ( 1 ) , we find @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "4c ) , which is compared with a harris sheet profile , and the current profile as a function of @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "the current is depleted at the center of the current sheet and two current peaks grow on the flanks of the initial current sheet .",
    "( this is unlike the harris sheet equilibrium , where @xmath53 is maximum at @xmath54 where @xmath43 . ) in fig .",
    "4d the current density profile is compared with geotail observations [ _ hoshino et al . _ ,",
    "1996 ( fig.4 ) ] and found in remarkable agreement .",
    "single crossing observations of current sheet bifurcation are shown by runov _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] and by sergeev _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] .",
    "we focus on fig .",
    "3c in sergeev _",
    "et al . _ [ 2003 ] , which shows reduced @xmath55 in the central part of the current sheet ( reduced current ) and enhanced gradient ( enhanced current density ) at the boundary part . in fig . 5",
    ", we plot a number of @xmath5 profiles as a function of @xmath33 , at different values of @xmath56 .",
    "the same features of the magnetic field structure shown by satellite observations is recovered .",
    "we finally remark that observations by geotail on 23 april 1996 show that positive @xmath57 corresponds to relevant current density @xmath58 [ _ asano et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] ; the same effect is also recovered within our simulation .",
    "not only does a kink instability grow , but also a tearing instability develops in the harris sheet , which leads to the reconnection of the magnetic field lines and outflow and inflow plasma jets .",
    "satellite observations typically reveal the reconnection process either by detecting inflow and outflow plasma jets , which can be very noisy [ e.g. , _ asano et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] , or by detecting earthward and tailward plasma jets with velocities of the order of @xmath59 or bigger [ _ hoshino et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] , or even by detecting flow reversal [ _ ieroset et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ] . in fig",
    "6 we show signatures of magnetic reconnection by showing a flow reversal associated with a change in the sign of the reconnecting field .",
    "the earthward and tailward velocities , detected during the crossing of the current sheet , are of the order of @xmath59 , which roughly corresponds to the typical order of magnitude of plasma velocity in the satellite observations .",
    "we have used the results of three - dimensional and two - dimensional kinetic simulations of harris current sheet to show that satellite observations of current sheet flapping , current bifurcation , and reconnection can all be explained self - consitently .",
    "we have chosen to start from a relatively thin and unstable current sheet ( @xmath60 ) in order to accelerate the plasma dynamics .",
    "such thin current sheets are indeed observed in the magnetotail [ e.g. , _ asano et al . _ , 2003 , for a review ] .",
    "flapping oscillations have been shown as the results a kink instability that affects the whole current sheet dynamics .",
    "frequency and amplitude compare well with satellite observations .",
    "both average and single crossing signatures of current sheet bifurcation have been detected .",
    "flow reversal , signature of reconnection , is also shown in presence of a changing sign @xmath61 component .",
