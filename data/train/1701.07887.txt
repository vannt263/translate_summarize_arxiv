    "actively accreting black holes have three fundamental properties  mass ( @xmath2 ) , accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) , and angular momentum . measuring @xmath2 for active galactic nuclei at all redshifts has become possible due to reverberation mapping of low - redshift agn and the extrapolation of those results to high redshifts , via relations between @xmath2 and the widths of broad emission lines and the agn continuum luminosity .",
    "accretion rate estimates have also been achieved for many agn , usually via the eddington ratio , @xmath4 .",
    "the angular momentum , or spin ( @xmath5 ) , of active bhs is more elusive , as it requires probing the region near the inner edge of the accretion disk ( ad ) .",
    "yet measurements of spin and spin evolution would provide valuable clues to the accretion history of active bhs and perhaps the evolution of the agn and host galaxies themselves .    at present",
    ", there are two primary methods for constraining the spin parameters of actively accreting bhs : ( 1 ) measuring the fe k@xmath0 emission line and/or a soft x - ray excess that some attribute to relativistic reflection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 2 ) fitting the agn continuum emission ( cf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are significant advantages and drawbacks to each method .",
    "the fe k@xmath0 method is based on relativistic x - ray reflection .",
    "it does not require prior knowledge of @xmath2 , the distance to the source , or the inclination of the disk , whereas these are all necessary ingredients for the cf method .",
    "the main drawback , however , is that a very high - quality x - ray spectrum is required to properly model the continuum emission and the fe - k@xmath0 emission line , severely limiting the number of sources for which current technology allows a spin measurement . as a result , most agn with reflection measurements",
    "are at a redshift less than 0.1 .",
    "furthermore , the fe k@xmath0 emission line is present in just @xmath640% of bright , nearby type i agn @xcite , so some spin estimates are based on modeling just a soft x - ray excess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , r14 ) .",
    "the cf method , on the other hand , can be applied to any agn where the continuum emission can be measured .",
    "this vastly increases the number of agn for which a spin measurement can be made and has already been applied out to a redshift of @xmath61.5 @xcite .",
    "the primary drawback is that wide wavelength coverage , sometimes exceeding the capabilities of a single observatory , is required to properly measure the shape of the sed .",
    "furthermore , this method can not be applied effectively if the peak of the ad spectrum occurs in a wavelength regime inaccessible to current observatories , e.g. , the extreme uv ( where many agn spectra do indeed peak ) .",
    "this method generally assumes a thin ad model , based on @xcite .",
    "recent work has directly cast doubt on the x - ray reflection method .",
    "@xcite find that the soft x - ray excess that some attribute to relativistic reflection is more likely due to warm comptonization .",
    "similarly , @xcite is able to fit the fe k@xmath0 emission line for one of the agn with an x - ray reflection spin measurement without invoking relativistic reflection . for the cf method , while the standard thin ad model has been successful in fitting the uv - optical seds of many agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other work has found that the agn sed can be fit with the combination of a thermal disk component and a warm comptonization component @xcite , indicating the possibility of greater complexity in the continuum emission .    with these two methods",
    "now available and actively in use for the estimation of @xmath5 in agn , it is time to investigate whether these two methods give consistent results when applied to the same agn .",
    "this is especially important given the uncertainties in both techniques and because neither method can probe the full agn population .    in this work",
    ", we compare the x - ray reflection and cf methods for two nearby agn  h1821 + 643 and ngc 3783 .",
    "ours is among the first attempts to make this comparison ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "both targets have a published spin estimate from the reflection method .",
    "we perform the cf analysis and compare the results in detail . in  2 , we describe how we selected sources for this study and our search for appropriate archival data . in  3 , we describe the models and cf procedure ( based on @xcite ) . ",
    "4 and  5 describe our application of the cf method to the two agn , and we conclude in  6 with a discussion of our results and how the reflection and cf method compare for these two case studies .",
    "we assume a @xmath7cdm model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "according to @xcite , there are currently 25 agn with spin estimates from the x - ray reflection method .",
    "we use this list as a starting point to search for archival data to which the cf method can be applied .",
    "the cf method is most effective when the `` turnover '' in the ad spectrum is probed .",
    "this turnover occurs at shorter wavelengths for smaller black hole masses .",
    "we therefore look first for existing high - quality uv spectroscopic observations of these agn . via the mast web portal , we identify four agn with high - level data products for hubble space telescope ( hst ) faint object spectrograph ( fos ) observations @xcite : fairall 9 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4151 , and h1821 + 643 .    while the fos spectrum is sufficient for applying the cf method for h1821 + 643 , data at even shorter wavelengths is required for the lower@xmath2 seyfert galaxies .",
    "we seek quasi - simultaneous data , and , for ngc 3783 , we identify observations from rosat  taken on 1992 july 23 , just four days prior to the fos observation on 1992 july 27  that probe the appropriate wavelengths @xcite .",
    "hence we proceed with two objects , h1821 + 643 and ngc 3783 , for our detailed spin comparison .",
    "the fos spectra for h1821 + 643 and ngc 3783 are focused on the nucleus of the galaxy . for h1821 + 643",
    ", we verify that the fos spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hspec ] ) is dominated by agn emission based on the broad - band star formation sed fit in @xcite .",
    "similarly for ngc 3783 , the spectrum is at short enough wavelengths that the host galaxy contribution should be negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not correct the fos spectra for stellar emission .",
    "the only correction we make to the hst data is to divide out the galactic extinction , using the @xcite extinction law and the @xcite recalibration of the @xcite maps .",
    "the rosat data have been analyzed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , t93 ) , and we make no further corrections in this work .",
    "to apply the cf method , a model is required that can make specific predictions for the emitted radiation at each wavelength .",
    "standard thin ad theory @xcite has been used for several decades to describe agn continuum emission .",
    "newer models use this framework , but incorporate general relativistic corrections , comptonization in the disk atmosphere , and even disk winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we adopt the numerical code described in @xcite , assuming a viscosity parameter ( @xmath0 ) of 0.1 .",
    "the shape and luminosity of the thin ad spectrum is mainly set by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and the inclination of the disk to our line - of - sight .",
    "if we want to constrain @xmath5 , prior knowledge of the other parameters is necessary as the observed sed is not enough to break the parameter degeneracy of the models , where different combinations of these parameters can yield similar sed shapes .",
    "additionally , any intrinsic reddening in the agn host galaxy will affect the observed sed shape .",
    "we therefore adopt a bayesian approach that takes a large grid of models  with varying values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , inclination , and reddening  and maximizes the probability that any given model is a good representation of the data , while penalizing those models that are not consistent with the priors , which we establish for @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this routine calculates a @xmath11 value for each model , using continuum windows along the observed sed .    for the prior on @xmath2 , the reverberation mapping technique has been used to obtain @xmath2 for nearby agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these results have been extended to other agn , using the width of the broad emission lines and the continuum luminosity ( the  single - epoch method  ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a prior on @xmath3 can be estimated using @xmath2 and a measurement of the continuum luminosity at longer ( i.e. , optical or near - infrared ) wavelengths , assuming the canonical power law , @xmath12 @xcite .    for the disk inclination ,",
    "the only constraint we have is that our sample contains type-1 agn , so we can consider only inclinations where cos @xmath13 .",
    "for intrinsic reddening , to limit the number of free parameters , we use a simple power - law curve , where @xmath14 mag .",
    "we consider values of @xmath15 ranging from 0.0 to 0.50 mag .",
    "h1821 + 643 is a brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) hosting a luminous agn at @xmath16 .",
    "there are no direct reverberation mapping measurements for h1821 + 643 , but there have been several attempts to obtain @xmath2 via other methods .",
    "these estimates range from @xmath61.2 to @xmath17 ( @xcite ; r14 ) , and there are theoretical arguments that the mass could be as high as @xmath18 m _",
    "@xmath19  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the most recent ` single - epoch ' measurement using the h@xmath20 emission line , @xmath21 , from @xcite , and we use their measurement of log @xmath22 46.1 ergs s@xmath23 for calculating @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt errors of 0.3 and 0.2 dex , respectively , for @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : hcont ] , it is clear that there is a strong preference for a large , positive spin parameter .    in their analysis of the x - ray spectrum of h1821 + 643 ,",
    "r14 obtain both a constraint on the spin parameter and a constraint on @xmath4 and the inclination .",
    "applying these constraints to our cf routine , we obtain a similar probability distribution along the spin parameter axis as we did originally without these constraints .",
    "ngc 3783 is a well - studied seyfert 1 , sba galaxy at @xmath37 .",
    "the reverberation mapping technique has been applied to ngc 3783 , giving @xmath2 = @xmath38 m _ @xmath19 , with a corresponding continuum luminosity , log @xmath39 ergs @xmath40 , which we use to estimate @xmath3 .    because ngc 3783 is in a lower @xmath2 regime than h1821 + 643 , the peak of the ad emission is in the extreme uv , a regime where we generally lack observations .",
    "we can discriminate between different spin parameters only in the soft x - ray , where models with the highest spin parameters peak for lower - mass bhs .",
    "ngc 3783 has a complex x - ray spectrum , with warm absorbers and a soft excess that appears and disappears @xcite .",
    "we use rosat x - ray data ( see  [ sec : data ] ) , in addition to the fos data , to apply the cf method to ngc 3783 .",
    "we use the 1992 july 23 rosat observation , in particular , because it is nearly contemporaneous with the fos observation , and it extends to slightly lower energy ( down to 0.1 kev ) than more recent x - ray observations with chandra or xmm newton .",
    "t93 fits the rosat data with several different power - laws based on different absorption models , ranging from a simple power - law model with @xmath41 = 2.22 to a warm absorber model with @xmath42 ( which is similar to the value found by @xcite of @xmath43 ) .",
    "t93 also present a model with @xmath44 4.7 , which is much higher than other values in the literature , so we do not include it in our analysis .",
    "a difficulty with using the x - ray spectrum of an agn for the cf method is that there is a known power - law component at x - ray wavelengths of unknown origin , in addition to possible emission from the ad .",
    "hence , the x - ray data provides only an upper limit on the ad emission .",
    "we therefore first alter our cf method to search through our model parameter space for the models with the highest spin parameter that give both a satisfactory fit to the fos spectrum ( @xmath45 ) and do not exceed the x - ray flux at 0.1 kev from the power - law fits to the rosat data . to be conservative in our upper limit , we adopt the warm absorber model power law ( @xmath42 ) from t93 .",
    "we find models spanning the full range in spin parameter , including maximum spin , that can fit within the upper limit from the t93 warm absorber model power - law for the rosat data , as long as @xmath2 is at least as high as the @xcite @xmath2 estimate ( see , for example , the purple curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : nspec ] ) .      even for a maximally spinning black hole",
    ", the thin ad emission does not directly contribute to the hard x - ray band ( i.e. , above 2 kev ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : nspec ] ) .",
    "hard x - ray observations of ngc 3783 give a less steep power law than in the soft x - ray band .",
    "for example , t93 find @xmath46 when applying their warm absorber model to data from exosat .",
    "if we assume that the excess emission indicated by a steeper powerlaw in the soft x - ray band is due to ad emission , we can subtract the hard x - ray powerlaw from the soft powerlaw at 0.1 kev to determine a continuum point for our regular bayesian cf procedure .",
    "we use a value of 0.1 dex for the error on @xmath2 from @xcite .",
    "the results of the cf routine are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ncont ] , and we find a median @xmath47 . using the x - ray reflection method , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b11 ) determine a spin parameter @xmath48 at 90% confidence and @xmath49 at 99% confidence ( indicated by horizontal dotted and solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncont ] ) .",
    "ngc 3783 is known to have a warm absorber in its x - ray spectrum ( t93 ) , i.e. an outflow often presumed to originate from the ad of the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case for ngc 3783 , then the thin ad model must be modified , as the accretion rate would be reduced throughout the disk as material is ejected .",
    "the @xcite thin ad code provides the option of adding a disk wind to the model .",
    "we therefore rerun the cf routine using a model with a self - similar disk wind , where the mass outflow rate per decade of radius is constant .",
    "the mass outflow rate for ngc 3783 has been estimated to be @xmath50 times the accretion rate ; however , much of this outflowing gas may come from beyond the accretion disk ( t93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of an empirical estimate of the mass outflow rate from the disk itself , we illustrate the affect of a massive disk wind by choosing a mass accretion rate at the outer part of the disc equal to three times the accretion rate at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the results are presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ncont ] .",
    "the main difference between these results and the results without the disk wind is that lower spin parameters ( @xmath51 ) are much less probable in the disk wind scenario .",
    "this arises because the disk wind reduces the accretion rate in the inner part of the disk and thus suppresses the luminosity at short wavelengths . furthermore , while there is a high probability of @xmath49 both with and without a disk wind , there is clearly a lower probability of having @xmath48 if there is no disk wind ( there is a factor of @xmath61.6 difference in radiative efficiency between these two spin parameters ) .",
    "there is also a positive correlation between the amount of intrinsic reddening and @xmath5 , with @xmath49 ruled out if there is close to zero reddening .",
    "our aim in this work is to compare the derived spin parameters for the x - ray reflection and cf techniques for two `` case study '' agn .",
    "table  [ tab : table ] summarizes the results of the two methods , including values for @xmath4 , the disk inclination ( @xmath52 ) , and instrinsic reddening , as derived from the cf method .    for h1821 + 643 , a bright agn with @xmath53 ,",
    "r14 found @xmath54 using the reflection method .",
    "for the cf analysis , the hst fos spectrum alone is sufficient , and while we do not obtain a very precise constraint on @xmath5 , we find a strong probability of a spin parameter that exceeds the lower limit from r14 , giving consistent results between the reflection and the cf method .",
    "we emphasize here that r14 do not clearly detect an fe line , but instead fit excess continuum emission in the soft x - ray .",
    "for some agn , physical processes other than relativistic reflection are the more likely cause of this soft excess ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , making this reflection spin measurement a tentative one ( see also  1 ) . for the cf method , from the posterior probability distribution ,",
    "it is clear that if @xmath2 is higher , then @xmath5 would be constrained to the highest allowed values .",
    "whereas , if @xmath2 is any lower , we would be unable to obtain a meaningful constraint on @xmath5 .    for ngc 3783",
    ", the fos spectrum lies along the power - law portion of the thin ad model spectrum , and only in the soft x - ray regime can models with different @xmath5 be distinguished .",
    "fortunately , there is nearly contemporaneous fos and rosat data for ngc 3783 .",
    "however , the x - ray data includes the known x - ray power - law emission that likely originates from above the ad ( often called the `` corona '' ) . using the x - ray flux as an upper - limit , we find that as long as @xmath2 is at least as high as the observed @xmath2 , any spin parameter could fit the data .",
    "since there are other components besides the ad emission in the x - ray , if we assume that just the excess emission indicated by the steeper powerlaw slope in the soft x - ray , compared to in the hard x - ray , is due to the ad itself , applying the cf method to ngc 3783 gives a high probability for a high spin parameter , consistent with the 99% confidence lower limit from relativistic reflection ( b11 ) .",
    "however , there is a low probability of @xmath5 exceeding the 90% confidence lower limit from b11 , unless we include a disk wind in the ad model .",
    "the results of the cf method are , in general , consistent with the results of the reflection method for the two agn studied here . in particular",
    ", the agreement is improved for ngc 3783 if we assume a disc wind , which we include based on the existence of a warm absorber in the x - ray spectrum . the disk wind analysis",
    ", however , is tentative because it is unknown how much , if any , of the outflow originates from the inner part of the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the outflow originates further out and therefore does not suppress the short wavelength thin ad emission , there is a slight tension between the two methods , as the reflection method suggests a slightly higher spin parameter than the cf method without a disk wind .",
    "we also find that , without a disc wind , the highest spins are most probable for @xmath15 between 0.2 and 0.3 mag . while these reddening values are generally consistent with the constraints from broad emmission line measurements for ngc 3783 ( @xmath15=0.1@xmath550.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the reddening is actually closer to 0.1 mag , then there is even greater tension between the reflection and cf results for @xmath5 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite similarly find that the cf method suggests lower spin parameters for narrow - line seyfert 1s than the nearly maximal spin typically found for this agn subclass via x - ray reflection .",
    "our study highlights one particular strength of the x - ray reflection method for nearby seyfert galaxies . for ngc 3783 , with a bh mass of @xmath6@xmath56 m _ @xmath19 , the inability to probe the extreme uv prevents us from obtaining a very precise estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "however , we point out that recent work by @xcite casts doubt on whether the fe k@xmath0 line gives any information on @xmath5 for one of the agn in the reflection sample ( see also  1 ) .",
    "nearly half ( 12 ) of the 25 agn with spin measurements from the reflection method have @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "given that the cf method suggests lower spin for two cases with near - maximal reflection spin estimates ( 1h 0707@xmath58495 in @xcite and ngc 3783 presented here ) , these high - spin cases would be good candidates for further comparisons between the reflection and cf methods , especially those with even lower @xmath2 than ngc 3783 , whose ad seds would peak further into the soft x - ray .",
    "there is also a new method proposed by @xcite , based on microlensing , that could be included in future comparisons of spin estimation techniques .    as more and better x - ray measurements allow the reflection sample to grow and as better constraints on @xmath2 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allow the cf method to more precisely determine @xmath5 for larger samples of agn , there will be a larger population where both methods can be properly applied and compared .",
    "if such comparisons yield good agreement , then each method can be more confidently applied to the samples they are best suited for  nearby seyferts for the x - ray reflection method and higher redshift quasars for the cf method .",
    "if instead , these comparisons bring further tensions to light , then the assumptions underlying these methods may need to be revisited .",
