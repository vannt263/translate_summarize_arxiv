    "mitochondria are organelles in eukaryotic cells that provide most of the chemical energy , atp , from oxidative metabolism and more recently have been shown to play a key role in apoptosis or programmed cell death .",
    "mitochondria have their own dna and are thought to have evolved from a prokaryotic organism that became engulfed and lived inside the ancient eukaryotic cell .",
    "mitochondria have an outer membrane that surrounds a complex inner membrane structure that in turn encloses the matrix space of the organelle .",
    "the inner membrane and the matrix contain a rich collection of enzymes that are crucial to breaking down a number of metabolites such as fatty acids and pyruvate forming acetyl - coa .",
    "acetyl - coa is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to produce reduced nucleotides , nadh and fadh2 , that provide reducing potential for the mitochondrial electron transport chain that converts this energy into an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that the atp synthase uses to synthesize atp , the principal source of energy for cell function .",
    "mitochondria also interact with the cell in the process of apoptosis .",
    "when mitochondria receive certain signals they undergo a structural transformation that leads to the release of cytochrome c , which in turn causes the cell to destroy itself in a controlled process .",
    "our research examines the physical structure of mitochondria in hopes of better understanding a number of the key functions performed by this organelle .",
    "electron tomography has provided high resolution three - dimensional structures of  orthodox \" ( healthy ) mitochondria _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 100,100)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    these structures , shown in figure 1 , exhibit several features necessary for proper function .",
    "the inner mitochondrial membrane consists of a lipid bilayer that has two components .",
    "( 1 ) an inner boundary membrane ( ibm ) that lies closely apposed to the outer membrane and ( 2 ) a crista membrane that projects into the matrix forming cristae , which are either tubular in shape or lamellar .",
    "tubules are connected to the ibm by crista junctions ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , shaped like the bell of a trumpet  @xcite .",
    "the observed mitochondria have a large matrix volume that pushes the inner boundary membrane against the outer membrane and collapses the cristae into flat lamellar compartments .    in our work",
    ", we explore the possibility that at least portions of the mitochondrial membrane make up a thermodynamically stable structure that minimizes free energy  @xcite . rather than try to deduce the morphology from first principles  @xcite , we take the observed morphology as given and make inferences regarding the physico - chemical environment in which this morphology could exist .",
    "we begin by noting that the observed morphology shows a definite scale . that the crista junctions have a fairly constant radius of about 10 nm has been noted in several places  @xcite .",
    "in fact , their diameter roughly matches the spacing between the lamellar regions of the cristae and that of the tubules linking these regions to the junctions .",
    "it is certainly possible that some skeletal components maintain the spacing everywhere and thereby account for the scale .",
    "we consider the hypothesis that such skeletal elements exist only in the lamellae whose surfaces house the machinery of atp production which probably requires ( and gives ) some mechanical stability at a spacing that roughly matches the distance that the membrane bound proteins extend into the intermembrane space . in that case",
    "the shape of the tubular regions is determined by elastic energy minimization rather than skeletal elements .",
    "suppose that a cylindrical tubular bilayer of fixed length is constrained in such a way that it can only increase or decrease its radius by exchanging area ( molecules ) with a flat membrane as a reservoir .",
    "it is not surprising , all other things being equal , that its radius would grow indefinitely in order to mitigate the energetic cost of bending required by the formation of the cylindrical tubule .",
    "if , however , there were a positive osmotic pressure difference across the membrane favoring the exterior of the tube , i.e. the mitochondrial matrix , then osmotic work would be required to grow the radius of the tube .",
    "the result is a tradeoff of two energetic components ( bending and pressure work ) , giving an equilibrium tube radius whose magnitude depends on the pressure difference .",
    "although such a pressure difference has not been measured , the matrix volume has been shown to respond to changes in osmolarity of the surrounding media  @xcite , and the crista junction diameters respond to changes in matrix volume  @xcite    the imm has been shown to contain several types of phospholipids .",
    "in addition , 50% of membrane surface is occupied by proteins , while proteins make up approximately 75% of the inner membrane mass . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "our model includes no proteins and only the two most common lipid types : phosphatidyl ethanolamine ( pe ) and phosphatidyl choline ( pc ) .",
    "these occur naturally in the imm at fractions of 27.7% and 44.5% , respectively .",
    "moreover , in our model , we consider only the dioleic acid esters of the lipds , dope and dopc , each of which is heterogeneous with respect to its fatty acid composition .",
    "although most authors neglect membrane composition altogether , some have attributed the variations in membrane curvature to the existence of domains of differently shaped molecules   @xcite .",
    "while for lipids of limited viscibility  @xcite these can be seen , we do not expect this to be the case for dope and dopc which are chemically very similar and thus should form nearly ideal solutions in which the entropic incentive to mix is far outweighed by possible energetic advantages of segregation .",
    "however , a different lipid composition on in the two monolayers of the tubular membrane is to be expected .",
    "hence , we assess the extent to which the geometry of the lipids contributes to the shape of the membrane .",
    "the contest here is between the entropic contribution to the free energy and the bending energy savings obtained by distributing the molecules according to shape .",
    "we formulate the free energy of a tubule plus surroundings as a function of its radius and composition .",
    "optimality with respect to variation of the radius gives a predicted osmotic pressure difference @xmath0 across the membrane .",
    "optimality with respect to composition predicts the extent to which shape - based redistribution takes place among the molecules .",
    "the two most extreme curvature environments are represented by the inner and outer monolayers of the tube .",
    "the composition of the principal lipid is calculated to vary by about 7% between these two regions for the observed tubular size .",
    "this result reveals a dominant role played by the entropic contribution to the free energy at normal physiological temperatures .",
    "although our approach does not come close to explaining all aspects of inner membrane morphology , it is well grounded in experimental observations and enables us to leverage observed morphologies into predictions regarding additional aspects of the physico - chemical environment in which membrane morphology is observed .",
    "in this section we formulate the free energy of a tubule and its surroundings as a function of its radius and composition . the flat portions act as a reservoir which constrains the chemical potential of the lipid molecules in the tubules , which , by our assumption , must be in equilibrium with this reservoir . since the reservoir is a bilayer comprising a surface of mean curvature zero , the lipid compositions on the two sides ( inner and outer ) are the same , at least as far as bending forces are concerned .",
    "short of postulating a preference of some lipids for the chemical environment on the two sides of the membrane , we may assume that the compositions on the two sides are the same and act as a reservoir for lipid molecules in the tubular regions .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath1 molecules of dope and @xmath2 molecules of dopc distributed among the inner and outer layers of a cylindrical bilayer of unit length and a flat bilayer reservoir .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote respectively the total bending energy and the total entropy of the membrane molecules , and @xmath5 the temperature .",
    "then , up to constants in the radius and the compositions of the membrane , the sum of the free energies of all the systems that participate in the energetics of altering the radius or the tubule and its composition can be written as    @xmath6    in this equation we have dropped the @xmath7 term for the membrane and the @xmath3 and @xmath8 contributions of the surrounding cytosol .",
    "thus the @xmath9 portion is the free energy of the membrane while the @xmath10 term is the free energy of the matrix and intermembrane region , which depends on the volume v inside the cylindrical tubule and the osmotic pressure difference @xmath0 between the matrix and intermembrane space , with the higher pressure in the matrix .",
    "we will use the following notational conventions .",
    "subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 will continue to denote the molecular species dope and dopc .",
    "superscripts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 will refer , respectively , to the inner monolayer , the outer monolayer of the tubule , and either monolayer of the flat bilayer reservoir .",
    "@xmath16 will continue to indicate the number of molecules , and lower case letters @xmath17 and @xmath18 will indicate energy and entropy per molecule .",
    "more precisely , @xmath18 will denote a partial molecular entropy .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is the partial molecular bending energy of dope residing in the outer monolayer of the cylindrical tubule .",
    "consider first the total bending energy @xmath3 .",
    "the conventional approach is to employ helfrich s theory  @xcite and to take the free energy density per unit membrane area as    @xmath20    where @xmath12 and @xmath21 are the ambient and sponteneous curvatures of the membrane and @xmath22 is the bending modulus .",
    "however , to allow us to study the lipid redistribution between the monolayers of the tubular membrane and the reservoir , we employ a molecular level model .",
    "our model takes the bending energy of the bilayer to be additive over the individual lipids in each of the monolayers .",
    "following israelachvilli  @xcite , we take the bending energy of one lipid molecule in the cylindrical monolayer to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the compressibility modulus , and @xmath25 is the characteristic interfacial area of the lipid at the ambient curvature @xmath12 .",
    "the compressibility modulus is related to the bending modulus . for small deformations",
    "@xmath22 depends linearly on @xmath24 and the square of the membrane thickness  @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath12 will be given shortly .",
    "for a monolayer containing one type of lipid , @xmath25 is defined as the area of the membrane divided by the total number of lipids .",
    "@xmath26 is the characteristic interfacial area for a monolayer at the spontaneous curvature . since the spontaneous curvature and hence @xmath26 depend on the type of lipid , the bending energy differs as well",
    "this causes a redistribution over the two leaflets , since they both have different ambient curvatures .",
    "spontaneous curvatures have been determined experimentally and are understood as the curvature of  choice \" for a particular lipid type constrained to a cylindrical monolayer with minimum bending energy .",

    ", @xmath3 can be rewritten : @xmath34    a perfectly analogous formula holds for @xmath4 : @xmath35    it remains to formulate the @xmath36 s , the @xmath16 s , and the @xmath37 s .",
    "the @xmath38 s depend not only on the fractions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but also on the fraction @xmath39 of dope in the flat reservoir .",

    "a weakness of the current approach is that the helfrich energy ( [ 25 ] ) is only valid for small deviations from the spontaneous curvature .",
    "curvatures of the inner and outer monolayers of the tubules differ by up to 100 percent from the spontaneous curvatures .",
    "it follows that ( [ 24 ] ) is only approximately valid .",
    "currently , we are performing monte carlo simulations in hopes of obtaining the higher - order corrections to this equation . using these in the calculations will improve the results as will adding the effects of other membrane components on the spontaneous curvature and on the elastic moduli .",
    "in the present paper we have considered a two - lipid model of the inner mitochondrial membrane and examined the changes in free energy for the tubular parts caused by variations in shape and composition .",
    "the analysis led to two predictions : ( 1 ) the observed radius of 10 nm implies that there is a 0.2 atmosphere osmotic pressure difference across the inner membrane with the higher pressure in the matrix and ( 2 ) lipids redistribute themselves to give different compositions on the two sides of the tubular membrane , since the resulting decrease in bending energy is smaller than the entropic penalty . using a two lipid model",
    ", we found that for crista tubules of the observed size the absolute lipid compositions on the two sides of the membrane differ by about 7 percent .",
    "although the possibility that composition drives shape changes has been discussed before  @xcite , most approaches in the literature neglect a composition dependence . without such a dependence , the second term in equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is absent and the minimum of the free energy results from a competition between the bending term and the term due to pressure difference . instead of using expression ( [ 28 ] ) ,",
    "a helfrich term ( [ 25 ] ) is then used to model the bending energy . as can be seen in figure 3 , in our model",
    "the entropic term is almost constant , since the composition of the membrane is more or less uniform .",
    "hence , as first approximation , it should be possible to express the bending energy as a helfrich term",
    ". the bending energy can then be obtained from a measurement of the bending modulus of the inner membrane made on swollen mitoplasts . the measured value for @xmath22 will yield a value for the bending energy that accounts for all membrane components including cardiolipin and high concentrations of a variety of integral membrane proteins .",
    "our model predicts that changes in the radii of tubules and junctions correspond to variations in pressure difference .",
    "this might be tested experimentally by manipulating the osmotic pressure in preparations of purified mitochondria and observing changes in the radii of tubular components .",
    "it has been suggested that the junctions act as a barrier to the diffusion of cytochrome c. indeed scorrano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have observed that during apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) the inner boundary membrane remodels , and the radii of the tubules increase . in certain types of mitochondria",
    ", they can increase in these _ in vitro _",
    "experiments to 20 nm .",
    "as seen in table 1 , this corresponds , according to our model , to a large change in the osmotic pressure difference . on the other hand ,",
    "purified mitochondria that have been induced to undergo a permeability transition in buffer of low osmolarity experience an increased @xmath0 that causes the matrix to swell .",
    "the crista junctions in these mitochondria are slightly smaller with radii of 8.5 nm  @xcite .",
    "although the model at hand succesfully describes some of the features of the observed morphology , it fails to explain some crucial issues .",
    "for instance , as can be seen in figure 3 , the minimum value of the free energy for tubules is positive and hence these structures are unstable",
    ". the tubules will tend to shrink and vanish in the flat membrane regions .",
    "additional mechanisms must be at work that prevent them from doing so .",
    "one possibility is that such a mechanism is provided by proteins and skeletal elements .",
    "however , we can envision an alternative mechanism .",
    "since the inner membrane is confined by an outer one , its area can only grow by buckling or by creating protrusions .",
    "it is very likely that the confinement causes tensile stresses .",
    "currently we are investigating the possibility that , thermodynamically , the combined effects of osmotic pressure differences and tensile stresses , account for the observed coexistence of cylindrical tubes of finite radius and flat lamellar structures .",
    "in addition , since the membrane is fluid , tubules will continuously arise , grow , shrink , and eventually vanish back into the flat portions of the membrane .",
    "it is quite likely that not just the structural organization of mitochondria , but also temporal variations of this structure , are of importance to understanding mitochondrial functionality .",
