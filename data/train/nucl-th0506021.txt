    "the structure of the nucleon and its modifications in the nuclear medium is a very active field of experimental and theoretical research .",
    "the basic quantities , which reflect the charge and current distributions in the nucleon , are the electromagnetic form factors @xcite , which are currently investigated in elastic electron- nucleon scattering experiments from intermediate to very high energies @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the nucleon form factors is also inevitable to understand the electromagnetic structure of nuclei .",
    "electron - nucleus scattering experiments under quasielastic kinematic conditions , like the measurement of inclusive response functions in the intermediate energy region @xcite and recent measurements of polarization transfer in semi - exclusive knock - out processes @xcite , are ideal places to study the form factors of a nucleon bound in the nuclear medium .",
    "because the structure of the quark core and the surrounding meson cloud may be different for a bound nucleon and a free nucleon , one expects medium modifications of the nucleon form factors@xcite , and the exploration of these effects is an important subject at current electron accelerator facilities @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "effective quark theories are the ideal tools to describe the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "much progress for the case of the free nucleon has been made in faddeev type descriptions based on the schwinger - dyson method @xcite .",
    "an important point which still has to be implemented in these calculations is the role of the pion cloud around the nucleon , and the recently developed method of chiral extrapolations of lattice results @xcite provides important hints . on the other hand , the calculation of form factors at finite nucleon density requires also a description of the equation of state of the many - nucleon system , and here progress has been made by using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite as an effective quark theory : recent works have shown how to account for the saturation properties of nuclear matter in this model @xcite , and when combined with the quark - diquark description of the single nucleon@xcite this provides a successful description of both nucleon and nuclear structure functions for deep inelastic scattering @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to discuss the results for the nucleon form factors obtained in the simple quark - scalar diquark description of the nucleon at finite density in the njl model .",
    "we have to note from the beginning that this can only be a first step toward a realistic description , because it is known that axial vector diquarks are important for spin - dependent quantities@xcite , and the pion cloud is important for magnetic moments and the size of the nucleon@xcite .",
    "while the axial diquarks could be included in a further step like it was done for the structure functions@xcite , a reliable description of pion cloud effects makes it necessary to go beyond the standard ladder approximation scheme .",

    "second , the analysis of the experimental data is still controversial , mainly because of the model dependence of the coulomb corrections@xcite .",
    "in this paper we used a simple quark - scalar diquark picture for the single nucleon to describe the electromagnetic form factors of a nucleon bound in the nuclear medium .",
    "we used the nuclear matter equation of state derived within the same effective quark theory to assess the effect of the mean nuclear fields on the internal quark structure and the form factors of a bound nucleon , taking into account also the meson cloud around the constituent quarks .",
    "we have shown that this simple model gives reasonable results for the dirac form factors of the free nucleon if the finite size of the diquark is taken into account .",
    "this is particularly important for the neutron in order to obtain a small @xmath201 , consistent with observations . concerning the pauli form factors , in particular the anomalous magnetic moments and the behavior for large @xmath200",

    "this is consistent with the intuitive expectation that the mean fields , which reflect the long range nuclear correlations , should not influence the structure of the nucleon at short distances .    as an application",
    ", we considered the longitudinal response function of nuclear matter for inclusive quasielastic electron scattering . even in this region of relatively low momentum transfer , the medium effects on the nucleon form factors give rise to an appreciable quenching of the response function . in order to take into account the rpa - type correlations between the nucleons",
    ", we derived the nn interaction in the present quark model for the isoscalar channel , which is most important for the longitudinal response function . in the limit of zero momentum transfer ( landau limit ) , this interaction agrees with the more general landau - migdal effective interaction , which was derived in earlier works for this particular quark theory , and has many features which are similar to relativistic meson - nucleon theories .",
    "in particular , it is on the average repulsive in the region below the quasielastic peak , and becomes attractive for higher energy transfers .",
    "we finally would like to remark that the language of effective quark theories is very appropriate to address the problem of medium modifications of nucleon properties .",
