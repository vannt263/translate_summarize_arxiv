    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd allows to calculate short distance quantities perturbatively form the first principles .",
    "together with the use of factorization theorems , the cross sections for ( semi-)inclusive reactions are predicted at a large scale as a convolution of perturbative parton cross sections and long distance parton distributions . in the case of exclusive reactions , such as two - photon reactions in the light - cone",
    "dominated region or diffractive processes , the amplitudes factorizes in hard - scattering amplitudes and hadron distribution amplitudes and/or skewed parton distributions ( spd ) .",
    "such distributions were already proposed in the past @xcite and they become more popular nowadays @xcite since it has been realized their vital rle for the proper description of the mentioned reactions . moreover , as it was pointed out by j.  xi , their measurement can clarify the issue of how the hadron total angular momentum is distributed among its constiutents .",
    "one can expect that the study of the spds will be one of the central issues of hadronic physics in nearest future .    a promising way to access",
    "the spds is to probe the nucleon with a highly virtual photon via the compton scattering process , which is called deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "indeed , it is auspicious that a first evidence of experimental feasibility to detect such a signal has been revealed by the zeus collaboration @xcite . on the theoretical side the factorization of the collinear singularities has been proved at leading twist - two level to all orders in coupling @xcite .",
    "the local version of the ope does not converge in the considered kinematical region . fortunately",
    ", this problem can be overcome by a non - local light - cone expansion in terms of light - ray operators @xcite .",
    "moreover , from the renormalization group equation of these operators one can derive in a straightforward manner the evolution equations for spds .    here",
    "we shortly review our approach to complete next - to - leading ( nlo ) calculation , which is accomplished by a heavy use of the conformal symmetry to map the known results from forward deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) to the non - forward kinematics of dvcs and simple one - loop addenda .",
    "the problems within our modus operandi have been resolved by employing conformal ward identities and constraints arising from the algebra of the collinear conformal group @xcite .",
    "the virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) process on a nucleon can be measured in the reaction @xmath0 however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dvcs&bh ] , there is contamination from the so - called bethe - heitler ( bh ) process in which the final real photon is radiated from the lepton beam .",
    "thus , the scattering amplitude square @xmath1 in the cross section , @xmath2 contains beside the vcs and bh parts also the interference term : @xmath3 the bh - amplitude is purely real and is given as a contraction of the leptonic tensor @xmath4 u(k , \\lambda)\\ ] ] with the hadronic current @xmath5 : @xmath6 since dirac and pauli form factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 are ( partially ) known from experimental measurements and can be parametrized to a certain accuracy by double dipole formulae , one can disentangle the content of the hadronic tensor @xmath9 : @xmath10 this tensor , defined by the time ordered product of two electromagnetic currents @xmath11 is a result of parity invariance . ] independent kinematical structures @xcite .    measuring the cross section ( [ cross - section - def ] ) in quite different experiments : with negatively or positively charged lepton beam , with ( un)polarized beam or ( un)polarized target , the rich structure of the hadronic tensor can be explored in different kinematical regions . in the following we are interested in dvcs , where @xmath12 is large and",
    "@xmath13 is small .",
    "unfortunately , since the dvcs amplitude ( [ vcs - amplitude ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath14 while the bh amplitude ( [ bh - amplitude ] ) grows up with decreasing @xmath13 , in this kinematics it will be a delicate task to extract the vcs amplitude for large virtualities @xmath15 and especially low @xmath13 from experimental data .",
    "on the other hand it is promising to look for asymmetries which allow one to measure the interference term directly and get in this way access to the real and imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude @xcite :    1 .",

    "( either the lepton - beam or the nucleon is polarized ) @xmath17 3 .",
    "@xmath18    where @xmath19 with @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle of the final nucleon ( lepton ) .",
    "to describe different `` two - photon '' processes in the light - cone dominated region in a unique way , we generalize the bjorken limit and introduce the scaling variables : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is related to the bjorken variable @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the so - called skewedness parameter .",
    "formally , this parameter interpolates between different processes as given in table [ tab - kinlcd ] .",
    ".[tab - kinlcd ] the value of the scaling variable @xmath24 for different two - photon processes .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     since in the case of dvcs the longitudinal part of the hadronic tensor vanishes , there are only two kinematical structures left to leading twist - two accuracy : @xmath25 here the transverse part of the metric tensor , denoted by @xmath26 , and the @xmath27-tensor are contracted with the projection operators @xmath28 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the appearing amplitudes can be calculated by means of the ope .",
    "in contrast to the case of dis , a larger number of ( local ) operators and their wilson coefficients contribute in the non - forward case .",
    "fortunately , we can appreciate the conformal ope ( cope ) @xcite , which tells us that all wilson coefficients are fixed up to an overall normalization , which can be taken from known results in dis .",
    "the conformal operators appearing in the cope are : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components are obtained by contraction with the two light - like vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "scheme their mixing is only induced by the trace anomaly and proportional to @xmath42 @xcite : @xmath43 the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath44 is , up to a normalization factor in the mixed channels , the same as in dis .",
    "unfortunately , for the case of dvcs kinematics the cope in its local version does not converge .",
    "thus , it is necessary to resum the local operators into so - called light - ray ones .",

    "for the numerical estimation of the hard - scattering amplitudes ( [ def - t ] ) we perform also an expansion with respect to legendre polynomials which allows us to include easily evolution effects . however , this method is not appropriate to study the low @xmath77 region . in general",
