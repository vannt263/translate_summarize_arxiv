    "studies of cosmological solutions of einstein s field equations have a long tradition and led to astonishing results about our own universe .",
    "in particular , observations indicate that there was a big bang in the distant past , and indeed , the simplest cosmological models , namely the friedmann solutions for reasonable matter fields , predict precisely this behavior .",
    "the question arises whether such curvature singularities occur for generic solutions of einstein s field equations or if the strong symmetry assumptions underlying the friedmann models are necessary for this .",
    "the hawking - penrose singularity theorems @xcite shed some light on this question .",
    "they predict incompleteness of causal geodesics in a wide class of situations .",
    "however , the information about the reason for the incompleteness provided by these theorems is very limited , and it is indeed not true that it is always caused by a geometric singularity .    let us restrict all of our investigations to vacuum with a vanishing cosmological constant and to four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the corresponding cauchy problem for einstein s field equations is well - posed and leads to the notion of the maximal globally hyperbolic development ( mghd ) of a given cauchy data set @xcite .",
    "the example of the taub solution @xcite shows that incompleteness of causal geodesics , as predicted by the singularity theorems , signals a different kind of phenomenon where it is possible to extend the mghd .",
    "the extended solutions are not globally hyperbolic .",
    "there exist closed causal curves and indeed , there are several non - equivalent extensions . this unexpected property has caused an ongoing debate in the literature .",
    "are such pathological phenomena a typical feature of einstein s theory of gravity  in which case it could not be considered as a `` proper '' physical theory  or do such phenomena only occur under very strong and special assumptions , for example the high symmetry of the taub solutions ?",
    "an interesting and intensively debated hypothesis in this context is the strong cosmic censorship conjecture whose widely accepted formulation was given for the first time in @xcite , based on ideas by eardly and moncrief @xcite and penrose @xcite .",
    "more details and references can be found in @xcite .",
    "this conjecture states that the mghd of _ generic _ cauchy data is _",
    "inextendible_. roughly speaking , this implies that , in the generic situation , incompleteness of causal geodesics is indeed caused by a geometric singularity in some sense .    in his effort to generalize the family of taub solutions and hence to show that there is a large ( but still non - generic ) class of solutions of the field equations with similar `` undesired '' properties , moncrief defines the family of _ generalized taub - nut spacetimes _ in @xcite .",
    "he is able to prove an existence result under an analyticity assumption .",
    "our motivation in this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we want to extend the existence result to the smooth case and formulate it as a singular initial value problem with `` asymptotic data '' on the cauchy horizon . however , in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case with gowdy symmetry .",
    "secondly , we want to study the global behavior of such solutions . by means of so - called soliton methods",
    ", it turns out that in the generic case , the existence of a past cauchy horizon implies the existence of a future cauchy horizon , at least under certain topological assumptions on the horizons discussed later .",
    "the reader should compare these results to the @xmath2case in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : geomprelim ] we discuss some background material , in particular the symmetry reduction introduced by geroch which is necessary to be able to write the metric and the field equations in a useful way .",
    "section  [ sec : gentaubnut ] is devoted to the definition and discussion of our class of _ smooth gowdy symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions _ based on moncrief s earlier mentioned class .",
    "the existence and uniqueness theory and the corresponding singular initial value problem is considered in section  [ sec : existence ] .",
    "the basic ingredients for these investigations are fuchsian methods which we describe briefly in the appendix .",
    "the next main part is section  [ sec : linearproblem ] where we discuss the global - in - time properties of smooth gowdy symmetric generalized taub - nut solutions .",
    "we finish the paper with conclusions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we briefly present here the symmetry reduction introduced by geroch in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be an oriented and time - oriented globally hyperbolic @xmath4-dimensional spacetime endowed with a metric @xmath5 of signature @xmath6 , a global time - function @xmath7 and a cauchy surface @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the volume form of @xmath5 by @xmath9 and the hypersurfaces given by @xmath10 for any constant @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "each @xmath12 is homeomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "now , let @xmath13 be a smooth spacelike killing vector field which is tangent to the hypersurfaces @xmath14 and set @xmath15 the twist @xmath16-form of @xmath13 is @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the covariant derivative compatible with @xmath19 .",
    "the field @xmath13 is hypersurface forming if and only if @xmath20 , which will , however , not be assumed in the following .",
    "we define the `` @xmath21-metric '' @xmath22 on @xmath23 , and , by raising indices with the inverse of @xmath19 , we define also @xmath24 and @xmath25 on @xmath23 .",
    "the first of these tensors is the projector to the space orthogonal to @xmath13 in @xmath26 , @xmath27 . from the volume form @xmath9 of @xmath19",
    ", we furthermore introduce the tensor @xmath28 let @xmath29 be any @xmath16-form .",
    "one defines the derivative operator @xmath30 as @xmath31    note that at this stage we are only interested in local patches of @xmath23 .",
    "then , the flow generated by @xmath13 induces a map @xmath32 from @xmath23 to the space of orbits @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath32 maps every @xmath27 to the ( locally ) uniquely determined integral curve of @xmath13 starting at @xmath34 . the requirement that @xmath32 is a smooth map induces a differentiable structure on @xmath33 , and",
    "hence @xmath33 can be considered as a smooth manifold . using @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ", geroch shows that there is a unique metric on @xmath33 which pulls back to @xmath37 along @xmath32 .",
    "we call this metric on @xmath33 again @xmath37 .",
    "the same can be done for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are henceforth considered as objects on the quotient space @xmath33 .",
    "the first is just the identity operator , while the second is the inverse of the @xmath21-metric @xmath37 on @xmath33 .",
    "we can proceed in the same way with the function @xmath38 , the @xmath16-form @xmath39 , the tensor @xmath40 and the covariant derivative operator @xmath41 , which can henceforth be considered as objects on @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath40 becomes the volume form of @xmath37 and @xmath41 the covariant derivative operator compatible with @xmath37 .",
    "geroch shows that einstein s vacuum field equations on @xmath42 imply that the @xmath16-form @xmath43 is closed , @xmath44 .",
    "our local considerations allow us to introduce the twist potential @xmath45 so that @xmath46 .",
    "the basic quantities @xmath38 , @xmath45 and @xmath37 on @xmath33 completely characterize the geometry of @xmath42 .",
    "now geroch introduces a conformal rescaling @xmath47 we refer to the associated covariant derivative operator as @xmath48 , ricci tensor as @xmath49 etc .",
    "he shows that the vacuum field equations for @xmath42 ( and certain geometric identities ) are equivalent to the following set of equations @xmath50 these equations are the euler - lagrange equations of the lagrangian density @xmath51.\\ ] ] hence , the equations can be interpreted as @xmath21-dimensional gravity on @xmath33 coupled to a wave map @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath54-dimensional hyperbolic space represented by the components @xmath55 .",
    "we point out that the quotient manifold @xmath33 can be identified with the surfaces orthogonal to @xmath13 if and only if @xmath13 is hypersurface forming , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "however , in general this is not the case and the manifold @xmath33 can not be interpreted as a submanifold of @xmath23 .",
    "we specialize the previous general discussion to the case @xmath57 .",
    "now , the cauchy surfaces are @xmath58",
    ". we think of @xmath59as the submanifold of @xmath60 determined by @xmath61 .",
    "the euler coordinates of @xmath0 are written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "clearly , these coordinates break down at the _ poles _ @xmath65 and @xmath32 .",
    "we will also use the coordinates @xmath66 determined by @xmath67 note that the coordinate fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 are smooth non - vanishing vector fields on @xmath59 , while the fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanish at certain places . note that these fields can be characterized geometrically ( without making reference to coordinates ) in terms of left- and right - invariant vector fields with respect to the standard action of @xmath72 on @xmath59 ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "we specialize now to the case of a metric @xmath19 with a spacelike killing vector field @xmath13 which generates a smooth effective action of the group @xmath73 on @xmath23 such that @xmath13 is tangent to the level sets of the time function @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the integral curves of @xmath13 are closed in @xmath14 for each @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath8 , and hence @xmath14 for each @xmath7 , is a hopf bundle generated by @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the map @xmath32 , defined in the previous section , is a hopf map from @xmath57 to @xmath74 . in order to give an explicit representation of this map , we can introduce , on @xmath14 for every @xmath7 , either euler coordinates or the coordinates @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 of the embedding into @xmath60 .",
    "there is no loss of generality in assuming @xmath79 because we can apply a diffeomorphism from @xmath59to itself to achieve this for each @xmath7 .",
    "however , from the point of view of the initial value problem , the assumption @xmath79 is not compatible with all coordinate gauges ; see below . in any case , this allows to represent the map @xmath32 as @xmath80 here we consider @xmath81as the submanifold of @xmath82 determined by @xmath83 .",
    "when we introduce standard polar coordinates on @xmath81 , namely @xmath84 then we have that @xmath32 is simply @xmath85 in particular , the push - forward of @xmath68 to @xmath86 along @xmath32 vanishes and the push - forward of @xmath69 equals the coordinate vector field @xmath87 on @xmath88 .",
    "we point out that eq .",
    "yields a global representation of the map @xmath32 . since both @xmath33 and @xmath23",
    "are simply connected , the twist potential @xmath45 is defined globally .",
    "the vector fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 will play a major role in the following discussion .",
    "the fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 , on the other hand , can not be used for geroch s reduction directly because they vanish at either @xmath65 or @xmath89 .",
    "let us now consider a global smooth effective action of the group with itself . ]",
    "@xmath90 with a second spatial killing vector field @xmath91 commuting with @xmath13 , under the same assumptions as before .",
    "we can suppose @xmath92 and @xmath93 , since it can be shown that all smooth effective actions of @xmath94 on @xmath0 are equivalent in the sense that any other smooth effective action equals the previous action after possibly applying a diffeomorphism of @xmath59into itself and an automorphism of @xmath94 to itself @xcite .",
    "this group action degenerates , in the sense that the group orbits become @xmath16-dimensional , precisely at @xmath65 and at @xmath89 . when @xmath65 , the field @xmath71 vanishes , while @xmath70 vanishes at @xmath89 .",
    "note that the fields @xmath95 and @xmath96 never vanish , but both become parallel at @xmath65 and @xmath89 .",
    "the action of the group @xmath73 discussed in the previous section can be associated with the action of the subgroup @xmath97 of @xmath90 .",
    "we consider geroch s symmetry reduction only with respect to @xmath13 and the corresponding projection map @xmath32 according to eq .  .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath91 commute , we are allowed , in principle , to apply the symmetry reduction successively one after the other for both fields .",
    "however , the result is then not a smooth manifold , but rather a manifold with boundary . in order to avoid the corresponding complications",
    ", we perform the reduction only with respect to @xmath13 and obtain the orbit manifold @xmath74 with the @xmath21-metric @xmath98 with killing field @xmath91 . here , the push - forward of @xmath91 along @xmath32 to @xmath33 is again denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "recall that the push - forward of @xmath13 is @xmath99 .",
    "now , according to geroch @xcite and gowdy @xcite , einstein s vacuum field equations imply that the twist quantities of the @xmath90-action on @xmath23 , @xmath100 vanish .",
    "the geometrical interpretation is that the @xmath54-space orthogonal to the @xmath54-space spanned by @xmath13 and @xmath91 in @xmath23 is integrable to a @xmath54-surface everywhere .",

    "we have employed two , in principle , independent techniques for the two main steps of our discussion : the fuchsian method for the basic existence proof and the soliton method for the study of the global properties of the solutions .",
    "as far as the fuchsian method and the underlying singular initial value problem and hence the existence and uniqueness of solutions with prescribed `` data '' on a cauchy horizon is concerned , we can say the following .",
    "in general , it can not be expected that such an `` initial value problem '' for equations of hyperbolic type is well - posed .",
    "it seems at least necessary that the generator of the horizon , being a null hypersurface , is a killing field .",
    "this is the case here and also in the more general @xmath73-symmetric case discussed by moncrief @xcite .",
    "therefore under moncrief s assumptions , our fuchsian technique should apply in the smooth @xmath73-symmetric case .",
    "the results in @xcite suggest that there must be a @xmath73-symmetry in a neighborhood of a cauchy horizon in general vacuum spacetimes , at least if the horizon is compact and the generator has closed integral curves .",
    "so , there is hope that a similar singular initial value problem can be formulated under quite general assumptions and that the existence and uniqueness proof based on fuchsian methods goes through .",
    "we also want to mention that most of the results here can easily be generalized to solutions with only finitely many derivatives , cf .  proposition  [ prop : basicexistence ] .",
    "as far as the ernst formulation and the associated linear problem are concerned there is probably little hope of a generalization to situations with fewer symmetries .",
    "the introduction of the complex ernst potential relies essentially on the existence of two killing vectors , cf .",
    ", , and the linear problem makes use of the special structure of the ernst equation .",
    "however , it should be quite straightforward to apply the methods to gowdy symmetric spacetimes with additional _",
    "electromagnetic fields_. in that case one has to study the coupled system of the einstein - maxwell equations , for which , remarkably , a complex ernst formulation and an associated linear problem exist as well .",
    "the corresponding calculations would follow closely the investigation of axisymmetric and stationary black hole spacetimes with electromagnetic fields as presented in @xcite .",
    "we thank gerrard liddell for reading the manuscript carefully . f.b .  likes to thank the albert einstein institute in potsdam , where part of the work was done , for the invitation and their hospitality .",
    "here is a quick summary of the theory of second - order hyperbolic fuchsian equations outlined in @xcite ; a more detailed presentation can be found in @xcite .",

    "of particular convenience for this is that the equations are geometric wave equations with spatial domain @xmath88 .",
    "we assume that the time variable @xmath7 satisfies @xmath198 and use the operator @xmath574 to write the equations .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath386 and @xmath387 by @xmath575 and @xmath576 , respectively . when it is not necessary to specify the superscripts , we just write @xmath577 to denote any eigenvalues of @xmath578 . with this convention",
    ", we introduce : @xmath579 it turns out that these coefficients , which might be complex in general , are important to describe the expected behavior at @xmath195 of general solutions .",
    "consider a second - order hyperbolic fuchsian system with coefficients @xmath580 . to simplify the presentation , we restrict attention to scalar equations ( @xmath581 ) and",
    "shortly comment on the general case in the course of the discussion .",
    "fix some integers @xmath582 and constants @xmath583 ; indeed @xmath458 can also be a smooth positive function on @xmath133 . for @xmath584,h^m(u))$ ] , we define the norm @xmath585 and denote by @xmath586 the space of all such functions with finite norm @xmath587 . throughout",

    "we allow that @xmath591 is a vector of different positive constants for each equation .",
    "the constant @xmath592 , however , is assumed to be common for all equations in the system .",
    "the motivation for including the quantity @xmath590 into the definition of the norms is the _ standard singular initial value problem _ in @xcite . throughout it is assumed that @xmath593 is continuous and it is then easy to check that @xmath594 is a banach space . for each non - negative integer @xmath123 and real numbers",
    "@xmath595 , we define @xmath596 and introduce the norm @xmath597 it turns out that we must also use spaces @xmath598 .",
    "these are defined as before , but in the norm @xmath599 of some function @xmath375 , the highest spatial derivative term @xmath600 is weighted with the additional factor @xmath7 ( in our case here ) .",
    "it is easy to see under the earlier conditions that also @xmath598 are banach spaces .",
    "let us also define @xmath601 .",
