    "in its most combinatorial formulation , the theory of cluster algebras concerns itself with identifying _ which _ elements of a cluster algebra are cluster variables , and how these elements are grouped into clusters .",
    "some of the most central examples of cluster algebras occur as coordinate rings of important algebraic varieties in lie theory or geometry  grassmannians and partial flag varieties , double bruhat and positroid cells , decorated teichmller spaces . a motivation for computing _ all of _ the clusters in these important examples is that each cluster variable , moreover each _ monomial _ in the elements of any given cluster , is expected ( and in many instances , proven ) to lie in a version of a _",
    "canonical basis _ for the corresponding coordinate ring .",
    "the definition of cluster variables is recursive and somewhat technical .",
    "it begins with an initial choice of a _",
    " a distinguished collection of elements in the cluster algebra  and produces new cluster variables one at a time , by exchanging a current cluster variable for a neighboring one .",
    "the new cluster variable is defined algebraically in terms of the current cluster , in what is known as an _ exchange relation_. an extra layer of subtlety is provided by designating certain initial variables as _ frozen _ : these variables are never themselves exchanged , but they appear in the exchange relations defining new cluster variables . in any given cluster , the list of exchange relations defining the neighboring cluster variables is encoded by a _ quiver_. each time a cluster is exchanged for a new one , this list updates according to its own dynamical rules ( in a process called _ quiver mutation _ ) .",
    "this paper presents a way of calculating cluster variables and clusters for grassmannians without performing explicit exchange relations , using an appropriate group of symmetries .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath2 be a pair of positive integers with @xmath6 a multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the ( affine cone over ) the grassmannian of @xmath0-dimensional subspaces in  @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 denote the braid group on @xmath0 strands .",
    "we define a cluster - preserving action of @xmath9 on the cluster variables for  @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we use artin s presentation   for @xmath9 . for each artin generator , we define a regular map @xmath10 ( cf .   remark  [ rmk : nontechnicalsigmai ] for a description of @xmath11 that can be read without any background ) .",

    "however , we expect that this relation defines the kernel @xmath18 , provided @xmath2 is sufficiently large .    another important family of cluster algebras were introduced by fock and goncharov  @xcite in a pioneering series of papers on higher teichmller theory . for a semisimple lie group  @xmath19 , they considered spaces of ( twisted , decorated ) @xmath19-local systems on a ( bordered , marked , oriented ) surface @xmath20 .",

    "the argument we make ( using the ping pong lemma , webs , and forks ) is modeled on the one in @xcite ( which uses @xmath36-vectors rather than webs ) . our proof is easy to visualize in terms of tensor diagrams .",
