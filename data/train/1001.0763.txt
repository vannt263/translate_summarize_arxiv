    "a gapped state of quantum condensed matter is called topological phase when it supports stable gapless boundary modes , such as an edge or a surface state . the integer quantum hall effect",
    "( qhe ) , which exists in @xmath3 spatial dimensions and under a strong magnetic field , is the best known example of such a phase .",
    "the recent discovery of the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) in @xmath3 and the @xmath0 topological insulator in @xmath4 @xcite shows topological phases can exist even in @xmath5 spatial dimensions , and can be protected by some discrete symmetries such as time - reversal symmetry ( trs , t ) , particle - hole symmetry ( phs , c ) , and chiral ( or sublattice ) symmetry ( sls , s ) .    for non - interacting fermions , an exhaustive classification of topological insulators ( tis ) and superconductors ( tscs )",
    "is proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite : tis / tscs are classified in terms of spatial dimensions @xmath6 and the @xmath7 symmetry classes ( two `` complex '' and eight `` real '' classes ) ( table [ charge ] ) .",
    "the ten symmetry classes are in one - to - one correspondence to the riemannian symmetric spaces ( without exceptional series ) and , as pointed out in @xcite , they are equivalent to k - theory classifying spaces @xcite . for example , the iqhe , qshe , and @xmath0 ti are a topologically non - trivial state belonging to class a ( @xmath3 ) , aii ( @xmath3 ) , and aii ( @xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "the complete classification of non - interacting tis and tscs opens up a number of further questions , most interesting among which are interaction effects : do non - interacting topological phases continue to exist in the presence of interactions ?",
    "can interactions give rise to novel topological phases other than non - interacting tis / tscs ? what is a topological field theory underlying tis / tscs , which can potentially describe tis / tscs beyond non - interacting examples ?",
    "on the other hand , the ten - fold classification of tis / tscs reminds us of d - branes , which are fundamental objects in string theory , and are also classified by k - theory @xcite ( table [ dbrane ] ) via the open string tachyon condensation @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to speculate a possible connection between tis / tscs and of d - branes . in this paper , we propose a systematic construction of tis / tscs in terms of two d - branes ( d@xmath8- and d@xmath9-branes ) , possibly with an orientifold plane ( o - plane ) . besides the appealing mathematical similarity between tis / tscs and d - branes , realizing tis / tscs in string theory has a number of merits , since string theory and d - branes are believed to be rich enough to reproduce many types of field theories and interactions in a fully consistent and uv complete way . indeed",
    ", our string theory realizations of tis / tscs give rise to massive fermion spectra , which are in one - to - one correspondence with the ten - fold classification of tis / tscs , and come quite naturally with gauge interactions .",
    "these systems , while interacting , are all topologically stable , as protected by the k - theory charge of d - branes .",
    "we thus make a first step toward understanding interacting tis / tscs @xcite .",
    "we are also separately preparing a regular paper with more details and expanded results in @xcite .    in d@xmath8-d@xmath9-systems ,",
    "massive fermions arise as an open string excitation between the two d - branes .",
    "the distance between the branes corresponds to the mass of fermions .",
    "open strings ending on the same d - branes give rise to a gauge field , which we call @xmath10 ( d@xmath8 ) and @xmath11 ( d@xmath9 ) with gauge group @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and couple to the fermions .",
    "these two gauge fields play different roles in our construction : the gauge field @xmath10 `` measures '' k - theory charge of the d@xmath9-brane , and in that sense it can be interpreted as an `` external '' gauge field . in this picture , the d@xmath9-brane charge is identified with the topological ( k - theory ) charge of tis / tscs . on the other hand , @xmath11 is an internal degree of freedom on the d@xmath9-brane . for example , in the integer / fractional qhe , the external gauge field is the electromagnetic u(1 ) gauge field , which measures the hall conductivity , while the internal gauge field is the chern - simons ( cs ) gauge field describing the dynamics of the droplet itself .",
    "the massive fermions can be integrated out , yielding the description of the topological phase in terms of the gauge fields .",
    "the resulting effective field theory comes with terms of topological nature , such as the cs or the @xmath14-terms . in our string theory setup",
    ", they can be read off from the wess - zumino ( wz ) action of the d - branes , by taking one of the d - branes as a background for the other .",
    "one can view these gauge - interacting tis / tscs from d@xmath8-d@xmath9-systems as an analogue of the projective ( parton ) construction of the ( fractional ) qhe @xcite .",
    "our string theory realization of tis / tscs sheds light on extending the projective construction of the qhe to more generic tis / tscs ; it tells us what type of gauge field is `` natural '' to couple with fermions in topological phases , and guarantees the topological stability of the system .    .",

    "the main conclusion of this paper is that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the tachyon - free d@xmath8-d@xmath9 systems and the ten classes of topological insulators in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "indeed , we explicitly constructed the corresponding ten classes of d@xmath8-d@xmath9 brane configurations in superstring theory .",
    "two out of ten are realized in type ii string theory without orientifolds , while the other eight require orientifolds .",
    "the k - theory charges of the d@xmath9-branes agree with that of the topological insulators .",
    "one may wonder if there are other tachyon - free d@xmath8-d@xmath9 systems which have not been considered in this paper .",
    "however , it turns out that their low - energy theories just correspond to multiple copies of the ten classes of topological insulators ( for details refer to @xcite ) .",
    "since a topological insulator has a mass gap in the bulk , the distance between the d@xmath8 and d@xmath9 is taken to be non - vanishing in its corresponding d - brane system .",
    "when we discuss the boundary of a ti / tsc , however , the d@xmath8-brane is bent toward the d@xmath9-brane and thus d@xmath8 and d@xmath9 are intersecting with each other .",
    "therefore massless fermions appear at the intersection and they are identified with the boundary modes ( or edge modes ) .",
    "we can also consider holographic descriptions of these systems by extending the constructions in @xcite in principle , though it is not possible to take the large-@xmath21 limit of @xmath0 charged d - branes .",
