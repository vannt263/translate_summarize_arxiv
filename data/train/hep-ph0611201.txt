    "in the mid of 50 s of last century electron accelerators of higher and higher energy were built , while their usefulness was limited by the fact the energy available for physics study , e.g. for analysis of interaction at small distances or for creating of new particles , is that measured in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) of target and incident electron . in the relativistic limit the energy in c.m.s .",
    "is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron energy in the laboratory system , @xmath2 is the mass of target . in electron - electron interaction for @xmath1=6",
    "gev ( the highest electron energy planned at that time ) one has only @xmath3=39   mev . because of this reason a new idea appeared : to create storage rings where two electron beams ( or two proton beams ) traveling in opposite directions could collide .",
    "the colliding beams idea was proposed nearly simultaneously in 1956 @xcite , @xcite and actively discussed at 1956 cern accelerator symposium .",
    "after several laboratories started serious @xmath4 and design activity .",
    "slac proposal to study limits of quantum electrodynamics was issued in may 1958 @xcite .    after completing my post - graduated courses at moscow lebedev institute at january 1959",
    "i joined newly organized institute of nuclear physics ( inp ) of siberian branch of academy of science of ussr .",
    "professor g.i.budker was appointed director of the institute .",
    "this was 40-years ambitious physicist working on fairly nonstandard problems of plasma and accelerator physics .",
    "the institute was formed on the basis of small budker s laboratory `` new acceleration methods '' at nuclear energy institute ( now kurchatov institute ) in moscow . at the end of 1958 scientific staff of institute was consisted of around 30 persons most of them were graduated students .",
    "the very new idea of electron - electron colliding beams , for realization of which many original development were needed , attracted budkers s attention and creation of electron - electron colliding beam facility became one of main purposes of newly created institute .    in 1959",
    "the colliding beams team worked on technical design of facility including some specific issues such as fast injection kicker magnets , ultra - high vacuum system , detector of scattered electrons , etc . at the same time",
    "the program of physics research was under development .",
    "budker seek for support of colliding beams project and invited known scientists to discuss the research program . in october 1959",
    "i.ya.pomeranchuk visited institute . in budker",
    "s office it was quite long discussion of electron - electron colliding beams facility where study of quantum electrodynamics at small distances was mixed with technical details of installation , which was at very beginning of construction .",
    "pomeranchuk was not in raptures concerning the discussion and no support to the project was expressed .",
    "besides other participants of the meeting did not express any enthusiasm .",
    "after pomeranchuk left institute , budker came to my office , he was complaining that institute research program is not enough impressive and one has to think how improve it .",
    "i replied that the program becomes immeasurably more rich , if one creates electron - positron colliding beams .",
    "`` you are mad ! '' said budker and left . but",
    "several minutes later he arrived back : `` tell me once more ! '' in very intense discussion which followed we expressed many times the pros and cons realization of electron - positron colliding beams . in the end , late in the evening , budker demanded that i had to lay aside all my business and concentrate on realization of new proposal .",
    "it was october 28 , 1959 .",
    "the next day active work began .",
    "we considered the electron - positron colliding beams installation step by step from morning to late evening . within a week",
    "the very rough draft of facility which later became vepp-2 was prepared .",
    "the maximal energy per beam ( 700  mev ) was selected to produce k - mesons .",
    "special attention was devoted to positron production by electrons in tungsten converter .",
    "the first design drawing of electron - positron facility were made in december 1959 .",
    "it should be noted that at that time all electron - electron colliding beam projects were on the very preliminary stage .    the research program which was formulated at that time was @xcite :    1 .",
    "study of elastic electron - positron scattering at large angle to test qed at small distances ( similar to a goal of electron - electron colliding beams ) .",
    "2 .   study of annihilation electron - positron pair into two photons .",
    "this is an additional test of qed .",
    "3 .   study of conversion of @xmath5 pair into pair of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "this is a test if the @xmath8 meson is pointlike and if so this is an additional channel to test qed .",
    "4 .   study of conversion of @xmath5 pair into pair of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons to study the electromagnetic form - factor of pion at time - like momentum transfer .",
    "study of conversion of @xmath5 pair into pair of @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons to study the electromagnetic form - factor of kaon at time - like momentum transfer .",
    "it is reasonable to describe the scene in elementary physics research at that time .",
    "a few electron synchrotrons with energy slightly higher than 1  gev were brought into operation in middle of 50 s , so the experience of work with such accelerators was quite limited .",
    "the table of elementary particles contained leptons : electron , positron , neutrino , antineutrino , @xmath13 meson ; and strongly - interacting particles : proton , neutron , a few types of hyperons , as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons and different types of k mesons .",
    "it is evident , that electron - positron colliding beams could give very new opportunities not only for test of qed at small distances but also for study of electromagnetic properties of mesons participating in strong interaction . at that time",
    "there was no information at all about these properties .",
    "even the cross section of such simple process as transformation of electron - positron pair onto pair of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons was calculated by berestetsky and pomeranchuk only in 1955 @xcite .    how to realize electron - positron facility was the question . first of all it was necessary to develop positron production system .",
    "positrons ( antiparticles ) were observed in cosmic rays and in reaction at accelerators . however",
    "considerable amount of positrons was never produced . in the 30s-40 s",
    "the theory of electron - photon showers was developed .",
    "this was a basement .",
    "but for electron - positron facility one has to produce _ beam _ of positrons .",
    "the elaborated scheme of positron production is used now everywhere , naturally with many perfection : the electron beam with energy a few hundreds mev is directed to heavy metal ( e.g. tungsten ) target with thickness 1 - 2 radiation length . in the target electron",
    "radiate a photon in collision with a nucleus , then this photon interacts with another nucleus and creates electron - positron pair .",
    "created positrons should be collected and accelerated and then injected to storage ring .",
    "we started calculation of conversion of electrons into positrons nearly from the very beginning of project .",
    "the good peace of this work was done by synakh @xcite ( at that time my post - graduated student ) .",
    "for example , the calculated conversion coefficient @xmath8 of electrons with energy @xmath16  mev into positrons with energy @xmath17  mev into the energy interval @xmath18% is @xmath19 for the converter with thickness around 1 radiation length .",
    "the created positrons are moving mostly ahead in the direction of electron momentum . in the mentioned example",
    "the angle of positron cone is @xmath20 .",
    "so , other things being equal , for production of positron beam of some intensity one needs the electron beam which is thousand more intense .",
    "if one accumulates positrons by small bunches , then the storage time will be thousand times longer .",
    "a few graduated student were recruited to the team which started the development of electron - positron facility .",
    "they began more detail study of the project including electron injector , ejection from it using the fast kicker magnets , channels and conversion of electrons into positrons in one of channels , injection into sole storage ring where electrons and positrons are moving in opposite directions , ultra - high vacuum system in storage ring and stability of orbits in it .    at that time",
    "( end of 1959 ) the electron - electron colliding beam projects were only at very preliminary stage of development and some people doubted that the colliding beam technology could be used in high - energy physics research .",
    "in this situation the proposal to build the electron - positron facility with essentially higher requirements for intensity and quality of beams was coldly received by many famous members of soviet academy of science . only support of i.v.kurchatov at that time very influential director of nuclear energy institute permitted to start development of the project .",
    "another factor which lowered level of opposition to the project was transfer of the all team from moscow to the wild east : to novosibirsk , where building of edifices of nuclear physics institute began in 1959 .    in 1960 when the staff was still very small",
    "all members of the team were working on various topics of both electron - electron and electron - positron installations .",
    "alexander skrinsky was appointed as a head of laboratory .",
    "i have found not long ago the internal report of inp-1960 with a title `` motion of particles in an accelerator with racetrack '' by v.n.baier , v.s.synakh and i.b.khriplovich devoted to study of particle dynamics in vepp-2 .    in 1961",
    "the main part of staff ( including budker , skrinsky and myself ) was moved from moscow to the new academic town ( academgorodok ) in 30 km south from novosibirsk , where the first building of inp was constructed .",
    "evidently , transfer of the team with equipment was an obstacle in the way of project development .",
    "however , it was quite good financial support of the new institute in novosibirsk and this permitted to create quite effective institute s workshop for manufacturing of parts of the facility , and to order most big parts in novosibirsk industry from the one side , and to recruit many graduated students from novosibirsk universities from the other side .",
    "in the beginning of 1961 our library received _ il nouvo cimento _ with announcement about frascati storage ring @xcite .",
    "this showed that we were not alone in the field .",
    "but from point of view of our experience at that time it was evident ( we are worked hard at injection system and creation of positron beam ) that at best the very limited amount of electrons and ( or ) positrons could be stored in storage ring without direct particle injection .    in 1962",
    "some parts of vepp-2 were ready and tested .",
    "the storage ring vep-1 manufactured at big novosibirsk factory was first moved in 1961 to the kurchatov institute in moscow , then in summer of 1962 it was disassembled together with synchrotron b-2s which was its injector and moved to inp in novosibirsk where both was assembled fast and immediately the test operations began .    in the year 1963",
    "it was permitted the complete legalization of activity of inp . at the international conference on high - energy accelerators in dubna in august 1963",
    "the collider activity of inp was presented for the first time @xcite .",
    "the photo of vepp-2 assembly process was contained in the report along with other information .",
    "the main contributors are the authors of the corresponding parts .    before the conference we got information that the frascati storage ring ada moved from frascati to orsay , where there was the high - energy linac which was used as an injector .",
    "the new interesting effect was observed : the loss of particles in storage ring due to electron - electron scattering inside the bunch @xcite . under some conditions",
    "the lifetime of a beam in a storage ring is determined just by this event which is now called the touschek effect .",
    "we have learned at the conference that two more teams started the work in the same direction . these were the projects of orsay electron - positron storage ring aco with energy up to 450 mev at laboratoire de lacc@xmath21l@xmath22rateur lin@xmath21aire ( lal ) in orsay , france @xcite and electron - positron storage ring adone with energy up to 1.5 gev at laboratori nazionali di frascati ( lnf ) in frascati , italy @xcite .",
    "somewhat later we received description of aco in detail @xcite .",
    "this indicated that creation of electron - positron colliders became very respectable and perspective direction of development of high - energy accelerators .",
    "some kind of race emerged for the physics meaningful results at these colliders .",
    "the study of electron - electron scattering at vep-1 storage ring began in 1964 .",
    "the first small angle scattering event was registered on may 19 .",
    "a very important characteristics of colliding beam facility is _ the luminosity @xmath23_. the number of events per unit time ( usually 1 sec ) @xmath24 of some process with the total cross section @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "the luminosity is proportional to product of current in the beams and inverse proportional to the transverse section of beam @xmath27 . to obtain acceptable",
    "luminosity one has to work with enough high currents and small size beams .",
    "a very high vacuum and damping of beam instabilities are the necessary conditions to have reasonable small beam size .",
    "a new type of sophisticated detectors had to be created .",
    "ben sidorov was in charge of this direction in inp .    the data taking at vepp-2 installation began in 1966 @xcite .",
    "the results will be discussed below .",
    "on the first stage of the electron - positron project development one of main goals was the check of the applicability of quantum electrodynamics at small distances .",
    "the qualitative estimate of measured distance is used . ]",
    "is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the momentum transfer . for @xmath30gev",
    "the measured distance is @xmath31fm ( 1 fm=@xmath32 cm is a typical hadron scale ) .",
    "the cross sections of electron - electron and electron - positron scattering in born approximation ( order @xmath33 ) was calculated by mller and bhabha in 30 s . the fantastic development of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in 40 s permitted consideration of higher order corrections ( the series with respect to powers @xmath34 ) which are called radiative corrections(rc ) . in the late 50 s",
    "these corrections to the mentioned cross sections were the topic of qed textbook ( e.g. @xcite ) . at high energy @xmath35",
    "the actual parameter of decomposition is @xmath36 .",
    "calculation of rc includes obligatory ( because of infrared divergence ) contribution from radiation of real photons and because of this depends on the particular experimental set - up . in the specific conditions of binary ( @xmath37 ) reactions on colliding beams the photon emission from one of initial particles causes non - collinearity of the final particle momenta @xmath38 .",
    "since for elastic cross section the events with minimal @xmath38 are selected , this imposes substantial limitation on energy @xmath39 radiated from the initial particles .",
    "accuracy of measurement of final particles energy in the 1st generation detector was quite poor .",
    "this means that hard photon emission from final particles are allowed and this complicates calculation .",
    "the cross section with the radiative corrections @xmath40 taken into account are usually written in the form : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mller ( or bhabha ) cross section .",
    "the main term of rc of the lowest order @xmath43 ( so - called `` double - logarithm term '' containing the product of two large logarithm : logarithm of energy and logarithm of ratio @xmath44 , which arises from sum of contributions of soft virtual and real photons ) is @xmath45 , where @xmath39 is the total energy of emitted quanta .",
    "the different aspects of radiative effects in electron - electron ( positron ) collisions were analyzed with sam kheifets , victor fadin and valery khoze .",
    "the complete expressions for @xmath40 in @xmath46 scattering are given in @xcite and in @xmath47 scattering in @xcite .",
    "for typical experimental conditions at @xmath48  gev one has the radiative correction @xmath49 and evidently it should be taken into account in comparison of theory and data .    at high energies and for @xmath50",
    "the soft - photon corrections dominate , e.g. for @xmath51  gev and @xmath52 one has @xmath53 , and one ca nt be restricted to the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "so the general analysis of rc in the all orders of perturbation theory is of significant interest . in the 50 s it was fashionable to study structure of qed as a whole .",
    "the method of calculation of the cross sections in high energy qed proposed by abrikosov @xcite was used . within framework of this method ,",
    "only those contributions are retained which contain the maximum power of the large logarithms .",
    "for test of qed at small distances only processes with large momentum transfer are of interest .",
    "it s remarkable that in this case in any order of the perturbation theory only contributions of diagrams with one photon exchange between charged particle lines survives , while all other contributions cancel each other , and in double - logarithm approximation the scattering cross section after inclusion of soft photon emission acquires the form @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in double - logarithm approximation the cross sections of all processes of scattering and pair creation for large momentum transfers have soft - photon nature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as it was mentioned , only diagrams with one photon exchange between charged particles contribute .",
    "an interesting application is the behavior of @xmath55 cross section near threshold . in the case",
    "when there is no limitation on photon emission @xmath56 , where @xmath8 is the muon mass . for nonrelativistic muons one has @xcite @xmath57 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the momentum of final muon and @xmath58 is the angle between momenta of initial electron and final @xmath7 , factor @xmath59 takes into account the coulomb interaction between final particles found by sakharov @xcite : @xmath60 , here @xmath61 is the muon velocity . in the region where the coulomb interaction is insignificant ( @xmath62 ) one obtains @xmath63 in place of @xmath64 ; and for @xmath65-lepton @xmath66 .",
    "the test of the applicability of qed at small distances by electron - electron scattering was performed at vep-1 storage ring in novosibirsk @xcite and at princeton - stanford storage ring @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the data @xcite , @xcite have been compared with the mller formula modified by a form factor @xmath67 ( in vertex @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) and usually a simple parametrization is used @xmath70 and with radiative correction @xmath40 , calculated by tsai @xcite , taken into account .",
    "the limit @xmath71 corresponds to interaction of point particles .",
    "the results of experiment @xcite are @xmath72  gev and @xmath73  gev ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "the limit @xmath74  gev means that qed was checked for distance @xmath75 0.05  fm .",
    "the distance @xmath76 is much shorter than characteristic hadronic dimension .",
    "similar limitations where obtained for different processes at electron - positron colliders of the first generation ( 95% confidence ) :    1 .",
    "electron - positron elastic scattering measured in orsay ( aco collider ) with beam energy @xmath77  mev @xcite with rc @xmath78 results @xmath79  gev and @xmath80  gev and measured in frascati ( adone collider ) with beam energy @xmath81  mev @xcite gives @xmath82  gev .",
    "two - photon annihilation of electron - positron pair measured on vepp-2 collider in novosibirsk with beam energy @xmath83  mev @xcite results @xmath84  gev and measured in frascati ( adone collider ) with beam energy @xmath81  mev @xcite gives @xmath85  gev and @xmath86  gev . in this reaction both the modifications of vertex and of electron propagator in a consistent ( gauge invariant ) way were introduced .",
    "3 .   study of conversion of @xmath5 pair into pair of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons on vepp-2 collider in novosibirsk with beam energy @xmath83  mev @xcite gives @xmath87  gev ( 95% confidence ) and measured in frascati ( adone collider ) with beam energy @xmath81  mev @xcite gives @xmath88  gev .",
    "the tests of qed at small distances were continued at next generations of electron - positron colliders , which were built later in novosibirsk , stanford , cornell , orsay , frascati , tsukuba , geneva .",
    "the described above limitations were substantially improved ( by two orders of magnitude ) due to higher energy , larger circulating current and better detectors .",
    "for example , the two(three)-photon annihilation of electron - positron pair scattering and to the process @xmath89 there is an additional ( and quite significant for used energy ) contribution from @xmath90 boson .",
    "so these processes ca nt be used for pure qed test . ]",
    "measured on lep collider in cern ( geneva ) with beam energy @xmath91  gev @xcite gives @xmath92  gev and @xmath93  gev .",
    "the last limit means that qed is checked for distance @xmath94  cm .      at low energy @xmath95",
    "the electromagnetic processes are sorted usually over powers of fine - structure constant @xmath96 in frame of perturbation theory .",
    "the cross sections of simplest two - particle processes : electron(positron)-electron scattering , photon - electron scattering , annihilation of electron - positron pair into two photon or pair of charged particles are of order @xmath97 . in many - particle processes",
    "each additional particle adds factor @xmath98 to the cross sections .",
    "such processes were considered only in the form of rc , as it was discussed above . at",
    "high energy @xmath35 the situation changes ; the magnitude of the cross sections is determined mainly by the dependence on energy .",
    "understanding of importance of such classification arose along with development colliding beam program .",
    "the processes , diagram of which contains two blocks ( each of which is attached to charged particle line ) connected with photon(photons ) line , have nondecreasing as a function of energy total cross section . besides the power constancy in some cases there are the logarithmic growth with energy .",
    "the important example is the process of soft @xmath99-photon radiation in electron(positron)-electron scattering which was studied by victor galitsky and i @xcite .",
    "the emission of classical ( @xmath100 ) photons occurs in an independent way so that the cross section of process with the emission of @xmath99 photons may be represented as , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the cross section of elastic process , @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the `` classical '' current , for electron scattering off coulomb center @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the initial ( final ) electron momentum , generally each line of charged particle in the process diagram contributes to the current the combination @xmath107 . for bremsstrahlung @xmath108 , where @xmath42 is the rutherford formula . integrating @xmath109 over photon emission angles @xmath110 one obtains @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the electron scattering angle . in the limiting cases",
    "one has : @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the universal function @xmath115 defines the probability dependence on the momentum transfer in soft photon radiation .    to find the integral cross section one has to integrate @xmath116 over the momentum transfer @xmath117 .",
    "taking into account that the rutherford cross section @xmath118 it is clear that the main contribution gives region @xmath119 .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath117 is attained when all the momenta are collinear : @xmath120 .",
    "within logarithmic accuracy one can put @xmath121 . substituting the functions in @xmath122 for @xmath119 and performing integration",
    "one find the spectrum of bremsstrahlung of the photon with energy @xmath123:@xmath124 .",
    "the region @xmath125 does not contribute because of fast decreasing of the rutherford cross section with @xmath117 increase .",
    "the result of similar analysis for bremsstrahlung at electron - electron(positron ) scattering ( @xmath126 ) differs from this expression only by logarithm argument:@xmath127 and radiation takes place in the direction of motion of both colliding particles .    in the case of many photons radiation the integration over photon emission angles",
    "can be performed independently , so that @xmath128 .",
    "of course , for electron - electron(positron ) scattering in c.m.s .",
    "one has to use the corresponding classical current",
    ". however the only region of small momentum transfer contributes and final results is expressed in terms of the function @xmath115 . since at @xmath129",
    "starting from @xmath130 there is no divergence at @xmath131 and with high accuracy one can put @xmath132 .",
    "so , 1 ) the cross section @xmath133 does not contain large logarithm ; 2 ) the value @xmath133 can be calculated within power accuracy ( discarded terms @xmath134 ) ; 3 ) the main contribution gives region @xmath135 ; 4 ) at @xmath125 the cross section looks like @xmath136 and because convergence of the integral one can put @xmath137 within accuracy @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the cross section of @xmath99 photon radiation at electron - electron(positron ) collision is @xmath138 here @xmath139/5,~\\zeta(3)=1.202 ..",

    "when the scattering angle of an electron(positron ) @xmath152 the radiation ( within a logarithmic accuracy ) is directed along momenta of charged particles and photon emission cross section from initial(i ) and final(f ) particle is ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the electron - positron scattering cross section in the c.m.s . of final particles and @xmath155 is the electron - positron scattering cross section in the c.m.s . of initial particles .",
    "radiation of two photons at @xmath156 collision is of evident interest for colliding beam experiments .",
    "the most interesting is the case when photons are emitted in opposite directions along the momenta of colliding particles , because the coincidence of two photon registration permits to separate the effect from background .",
    "this process was used as a monitor of beam collisions and for cross sections normalization .",
    "the use of method of invariant integration of tensors representing the radiation blocks mentioned in previous subsection , simplifies essentially the calculation of integral spectrum ( the process is represented by 40 diagrams ) .",

    "it is striking that it was in measurement of 4-th order process .",
    "bearing in mind that the double bremsstrahlung can be observed in quite clean conditions and has enough large cross section which is known within very good accuracy , this process was used as standard method for luminosity measurement in novosibirsk , orsay and frascati .",

    "the polarization measurement was accomplished by the method described above in the paragraph ii , which utilizes the dependence of internal scattering effects on the polarization of the electrons in the bunch ( see eq.([16a ] ) ) . for the energy",
    "chosen ( @xmath299 = 650 mev ) the polarization time is @xmath384 50 min and the theoretical degree of polarization during the experiment is @xmath385 ( see eq.([13b ] ) ) . in this experiment",
    "it was extremely important to exclude the effect of depolarizing factors .",
    "for this purpose it is necessary first of all to be sufficiently far from spin resonances .",
    "if the depolarizing effects are taken into account , then the expected degree of radiative polarization is @xmath386 .",
    "the measurements were made in the following way .",
    "the electron beam in the storage ring was polarized for a time @xmath387 , and the particles leaving the beam as a consequence of internal scattering effects were recorded by two counters .",
    "then the beam was depolarized by application of an external longitudinal field . in this case",
    "the rate of departure of particles from the beam increases ( i.e. , the number of counts in the counters increases ) .",
    "the experimental results was obtained for an energy @xmath388 mev .",
    "a jump was seen in the counting rate , occurring at the turning on of the depolarizing field . from the size of the jump one can deduce the following value of the degree of polarization of the electron beam : @xmath389 which is consistent with the expected value of the degree of polarization given above with inclusion of depolarizing effects @xmath386 , although it is somewhat smaller .",
    "this was the first experimental proof of the existence of radiative polarization .",
    "let us list the main results obtained at the electron - positron colliders of the first generation .",
    "study of production @xmath282 pairs in electron - positron annihilation at energy higher than @xmath202 resonance mass .",
    "+ at the electron - positron colliding beam facility aco in lal , orsay ( the maximal observed luminosity @xmath394 ) : + 1 . the first observation and study of @xmath123 meson .",

    "discovery of touschek effect @xcite .",
    "\\2 . the first observation of @xmath5 collision ( 1964 ) in the bremsstrahlung reaction @xmath398 @xcite .",
    "+ so , during quite short time new type of accelerator was developed .",
    "this included fast ejection of beam from accelerators which were used as injectors ( where it was necessary ) , development of channels , convertors of electron beam into positron one , fast injection of beams into storage ring , prolong operation of storage ring with enough small beam dimensions ( to have an acceptable luminosity ) , which required high vacuum and damping of many instabilities evolved during operation .    both first generation detectors at vepp-2 and aco had some specific features .",
    "1 ) a good solid angle .",
    "2 ) ability to identify the particles in an observed event .",
    "3 ) reasonable track position accuracy .",
    "4 ) momentum analysis .",
    "5 ) background rejection .",
    "the first colliding beam experiments tested qed up to distances more than 100 times smaller than characteristic hadron dimension . described above results completely changed understanding of electromagnetic structure of hadrons supporting from one side the basic idea of vector dominance model , but from other side showing shortages of this model .",
    "@xmath211 symmetry was tested as well as @xmath211 breaking effects .",
    "thus , the electron - positron colliding beam project started in inp in 1959 as exotic venture , within a decade became one of the main roads of high energy accelerator development .",
    "new discoveries were ahead including november revolution of 1974",
