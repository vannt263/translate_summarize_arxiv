    "the standard factorization theorems of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) are the main ingredients in many phenomenological calculations of high energy processes ( for a review of the usual approach to collinear factorization , see  @xcite ) .",
    "they are especially important in monte carlo event generator ( mceg ) calculations ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) and , more generally , in many of the calculations relevant to up - coming experiments such as those taking place at the large hadron collider .",
    "the standard derivations , however , rely on a number of approximations that alter final state momentum such that over all four - momentum conservation is violated .",
    "hence , there is a potential for large errors when the standard factorization theorems are extended to more general situations than what have been considered in the past , particularly when the details of final states are of interest .",
    "to understand the origin of these issues , it is helpful to begin by briefly reviewing the basic structure of the more standard approaches to factorization . to start off , we recall that a basic component of the standard collinear factorization theorems is the concept of a universal parton distribution function ( pdf ) which describes the likelihood of finding a parton in the proton with a particular plus component of momentum .",
    "the partons are treated as having zero transverse and minus components of momentum in the hard scattering calculation . in the standard collinear",
    "factorization theorems , the pdfs have precise definitions as expectation values of appropriate combinations of field operators  @xcite . in these definitions , there is an integration over the small transverse and minus components of parton momentum because they are neglected in the hard scattering calculation .",
    "thus , the standard pdf may be referred to as the `` integrated '' pdf .",
    "standard collinear factorization relies directly on the approximations that allow the small components of four - momentum to be integrated over in the definition of the pdf ( for a specific illustration , see the introductory sections of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in spite of this ,",
    "the standard treatment is usually sufficient if one is concerned only with inclusive quantities .",
    "it is especially important that a well - defined operator definition exists for the pdf , since the universality of this pdf is part of what gives pqcd calculations their predictive power .",
    "it is now well - known that , in some situations , the transverse momentum of the struck parton becomes important .",
    "examples include the treatment of the transverse momentum distribution in the drell - yan process  @xcite , and treatments of scattering at very high energies ( small bjorken-@xmath1 ) where there is no transverse momentum ordering of emitted gluons  @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the use of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) pdfs which have explicit dependence on transverse parton momentum .",
    "these are also called `` unintegrated pdfs '' ( updfs ) because the integration over transverse components of momentum is left undone inside the definition of the pdf .",
    "there is still an integration over the minus component of momentum , so the factorization formula still involves approximations that violate over - all four - momentum conservation .",
    "however , this is not a serious problem for many applications .",
    "an important observation is that generalizing factorization to include tmd pdfs is not a simple matter of leaving the integrals over transverse momentum undone in the standard definition of the pdf . indeed , providing consistent operator definitions for the updfs involves a number of complications .",
    "one problem is that the most obvious candidate definitions suffer from divergences that arise from gluons with infinite rapidity in the outgoing light - like direction .",
    "these `` light - cone '' divergences remain even after an infrared cutoff is included ( see  @xcite for a review of this and related issues ) . a consistent definition",
    ", therefore , requires an explicit rapidity cutoff in the definition of the updf  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that factorization with tmd pdfs is violated for some processes  @xcite . for an up - to - date review of the different types of pdfs , see refs .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent work related to defining the tmd pdf .    the standard collinear factorization formalism and formalisms that use tmd pdfs accurately describe a wide range of phenomena .",
    "however , some studies  @xcite have illustrated that , at least for calculations which require detailed knowledge of final states , an _",
    "exact _ treatment of over - all kinematics is needed .",
    "in such an approach , the pdf should carry information about _ all _ components of parton momentum , including both the transverse and minus components .",
    "the definition of the pdf in this formalism should not involve an integral over _ any _ component of momentum .",
    "a pdf that depends on all components of parton four - momentum is therefore called `` fully unintegrated '' ( or `` doubly unintegrated '' ) . in this fully unintegrated treatment , the kinematics of initial and final states",
    "are kept exact throughout the calculation . however , as discussed above , the standard kinematic approximations are needed in the derivation of the usual collinear factorization formalism . hence , as with a treatment of tmd pdfs , the fully unintegrated treatment requires a new approach to factorization . among other issues , a precise definition for the fully unintegrated pdf",
    "is needed .",
    "a formal derivation of a fully unintegrated approach to factorization was initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "a complete , fully unintegrated treatment of factorization was given in the context of an mceg .",
    "to avoid complications with gauge invariance , the authors restricted consideration to a scalar-@xmath2 theory in six space - time dimensions .",
    "there , the derivation of factorization utilized a nested subtraction scheme in which double counting subtractions were required to obtain the correct hard scattering coefficient at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "this is a generalization of the approach to factorization discussed in  @xcite and is reminiscent of the bogoliubov approach to renormalization . performing the subtractions consistently required the introduction in  @xcite of a well - defined mapping from exact to approximate parton momentum .",
    "the derivation in  @xcite was for arbitrarily many jets in the final state .",
    "though the proof was for a scalar theory only , the procedure for mapping exact to approximate parton momentum is likely to extend to the gauge theory case .    in  @xcite , a complete fully unintegrated derivation of factorization for a gauge theory",
    "was given for the case of a single out - going jet . the focus in ref .",
    "@xcite was on the leading order ( lo ) contribution to the hard scattering coefficient ( though the single gluon vertex correction was also calculated ) .",
    "since the relevant ward identities do not yet have explicit enough proofs for the non - abelian case , the derivation in  @xcite only applies rigorously to an abelian gauge theory .",
    "the resulting structure is , however , highly suggestive of a similar factorization formula for the non - abelian case ( qcd ) .",
    "an important difference between the standard collinear formalism and the fully unintegrated formalism is the number of non - perturbative functions that appear in a given factorization formula . in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , for example , a total cross section calculation that uses",
    "the standard collinear factorization approach only involves a single hard scattering coefficient and a single pdf .",
    "schematically , the structure of the standard collinear factorization formula is : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is a hard scattering coefficient and @xmath5 is the usual integrated pdf for scattering from a parton of type @xmath6 inside the proton .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 denotes the usual convolution integral .",
    "by contrast , the fully unintegrated approach requires not only a fully unintegrated pdf ( fupdf ) in the initial state , but also fully unintegrated jet factors and soft factors to describe final state parton four - momentum .",
    "thus , the fully unintegrated factorization formula found in ref .",
    "@xcite for scattering from a target quark in the proton includes not one but three non - perturbative factors : a fully unintegrated quark pdf , a fully unintegrated jet factor , and a soft factor .",
    "the integrals that would normally allow the final state non - perturbative factors to be simplified are left undone in the fully unintegrated treatment .",
    "the structure of the factorization formula in ref .",
    "@xcite for dis is written schematically : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represent , respectively , the fully unintegrated quark pdf , the fully unintegrated jet factor , and the fully unintegrated soft factor .",
    "collectively , we refer to the fully unintegrated non - perturbative objects that appear in the fully unintegrated treatment as `` parton correlation functions '' ( pcfs ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pcfs in eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) are given precise definitions as expectation values of field operators .",
    "clearly , the proliferation of non - perturbative factors makes the fully unintegrated approach much more complicated than the usual formalism .",
    "the advantage , however , is that it provides a much more complete description of the distribution of final states .",
    "much of the work done so far with pcfs and the fully unintegrated approach to factorization has been rather formal , with very limited phenomenological applications .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to initiate a closer connection to phenomenology by directly applying the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to a calculation of the hard scattering coefficient for deep inelastic wide - angle jet pair production from a target gluon inside a proton .",
    "the partonic subprocess is then , @xmath12 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : boxdiagrams ] ) .",
    "this is the simplest possible calculation of a non - trivial next - to - leading order ( nlo ) hard scattering process in the fully unintegrated approach to factorization .",
    "since gluon - mediated processes dominate at small values of bjorken-@xmath1 , the resulting hard scattering coefficient can be used to parameterize the pcfs .",
    "conversely , with a particular model ( or parameterization ) of the non - perturbative factors , the fully unintegrated hard scattering coefficient calculated in this paper can be used to make direct predictions that are consistent with factorization .",
    "since the hard scattering coefficient is to be determined , as in  @xcite , from a sequence of double - counting subtractions , the calculation relies directly on the results of  @xcite .",
    "the result of this paper , therefore , is a prescription that allows for a simple and direct implementation of the fully unintegrated approach in calculations of gluon mediated dis .",
    "although the work of refs .  @xcite is sufficient to provide the steps for calculating the order-@xmath13 hard scattering coefficient , it is worth emphasizing that a complete derivation of factorization for the production of two jets requires a systematic consideration of arbitrarily many collinear and soft gluons . additionally , the ward identity arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite need to be extended to the non - abelian case . since the purpose of this paper is to begin to apply the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to phenomenology , we leave these important but more formal issues to future work .",
    "additionally , we set aside for now the issue of the evolution of the pcfs , initial / final state showering , or the relationship to other integrated or unintegrated gluon distribution functions .",

    "<S> we calculate the next - to - leading order fully unintegrated hard scattering coefficient for unpolarized gluon - induced deep inelastic scattering using the logical framework of parton correlation functions developed in previous work . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> , exact four - momentum conservation is maintained throughout the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , all non - perturbative functions , like parton distribution functions , depend on all components of parton four - momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the usual collinear factorization approach where the hard scattering coefficient involves generalized functions ( such as dirac @xmath0-functions ) , the fully unintegrated hard scattering coefficient is an ordinary function . </S>",
    "<S> gluon - induced deep inelastic scattering provides a simple illustration of the application of the fully unintegrated factorization formalism with a non - trivial hard scattering coefficient , applied to a phenomenologically interesting case . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the gluon - induced process allows for a parameterization of the fully unintegrated gluon distribution function . </S>"
