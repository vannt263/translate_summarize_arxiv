    "the proximity to the metal - insulator transition is well known to lead to an anomalous normal state of the high @xmath8 superconductors .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether , apart from the @xmath9-wave symmetry of pairing , also the superconducting state of the cuprates can be regarded as unconventional .",
    "most studies attempt to answer this question by considering the properties of _ quasiparticle excitations_. for instance , photoemission experiments seem to support the conventional alternative , since sharp spectral functions have been observed at low temperatures @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of strong correlations on the _ condensate _ has remained largely unexplored so far .",
    "this is surprising , since large quantum phase fluctuations are to be expected in the cuprates as a combined effect of the suppression of charge fluctuations and of the uncertainty principle . in particular , such fluctuations",
    "have been suggested to stabilize the rvb state and the presumably related pseudogap phase of the cuprates @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that by a detailed analysis of the josephson effect , new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations in the cuprates can be obtained .",
    "josephson junctions involving the cuprate superconductors have been studied mainly because they enable phase - sensitive tests of pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "attention has been paid especially to two particular types of josephson junctions : grain boundary @xcite and intrinsic @xcite josephson junctions .",
    "the best studied type of grain boundary josephson junctions involves junctions built on @xmath10-axis oriented films , where the weak link forms at the boundary of grains which are rotated around the [ 001 ] axis with respect to each other .",
    "idealized junctions of this type are characterized by a planar interface and two angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 between the interface normal and the crystallographic directions in the grains forming the junction .",
    "the properties of the junctions depend dominantly on the misorientation angle @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the transparency @xmath14 of grain boundary junctions decays exponentially with increasing misorientation angle @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , for @xmath17 , grain boundary junctions are in the tunnel limit and ( for @xmath15 not too close to @xmath18 , see section  3 ) their current - phase relation @xmath19 can be well approximated by @xmath20 , neglecting the higher - order harmonics .",
    "a useful quantity characterizing the superconducting electrodes forming the josephson junction is the product of the first harmonic @xmath21 with the junction resistance in the normal state , @xmath3 . according to standard theory ( for homogeneous featureless barriers ) , this so - called josephson product is independent of the junction area and of the barrier transparency , thus giving an intrinsic information about the superconducting banks .",
    "it is well known that at interfaces between @xmath9-wave superconductors , anomalous bound andreev levels may form @xcite . at temperatures larger than the energy of such andreev levels , bcs - like",
    "theory for rough interfaces between @xmath9-wave superconductors @xcite predicts @xmath22 where @xmath4 is the maximal superconducting gap .",
    "the measured josephson product of cuprate grain boundary junctions @xcite can be well described by @xmath23 with a @xmath15-independent renormalization factor @xmath24 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath25 data of @xcite , this functional form can be tested also for @xmath26 ( which case can be realized in break junctions ) with the result that average josephson products of such junctions @xcite are fully consistent with the grain boundary data . moreover , in @xcite it has been shown that @xmath4 is not depressed in the junction region , thus explicitly demonstrating the breakdown of the bcs prediction for @xmath6 in the cuprates .",
    "there exists no generally accepted explanation of the small renormalization factor @xmath27 .",
    "one of the reasons is that the microstructure of josephson junctions is typically quite complicated .",
    "in fact , it is well known that small angle grain boundaries can be modelled by a sequence of edge dislocations , while at larger misorientation angles the dislocation cores start to overlap and no universal picture applies to the structure of the grain boundary . for large - angle grain boundaries ,",
    "halbritter has proposed @xcite that the junction can be thought of as a nearly impenetrable barrier with randomly placed highly conductive channels across it .",
    "if due to strong coulomb repulsion only the normal current ( and no supercurrent ) is supported by these channels , the small value of @xmath6 follows quite naturally .    in this paper",
    "we shall argue that the smallness of the josephson product does not follow from the particular properties of the barrier , but is rather an intrinsic property of the cuprates .",
    "such a point of view has been first advocated in @xcite . however , that paper did not consider alternative more conventional explanations . in order to support our point of view ,",
    "let us begin by discussing the josephson product for intrinsic josephson junctions in the @xmath10-axis direction .",
    "such junctions can be viewed as an analogue of @xmath28-plane break junctions ( since the misorientation angle vanishes for both ) , but are preferable because of simpler geometry of the interface .",
    "moreover , zero energy surface bound states which may develop at @xmath28-plane surfaces because of the @xmath9-wave symmetry of the pairing state @xcite do not form in the @xmath10-axis direction , simplifying the analysis of intrinsic josephson junctions .",
    "standard bcs theory applied to the case of tunneling between two - dimensional superconductors @xcite predicts ( for coherent @xmath10-axis tunneling ) that the @xmath10-axis critical josephson current density is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes an average along the ( two dimensional ) fermi line , @xmath31 is the wavefunction renormalization , and @xmath32 is the matrix element for @xmath10-axis tunneling between neighboring cuo@xmath33 planes .",
    "@xmath34 is the bare ( unrenormalized ) density of states , @xmath35 , where the integration runs along the two dimensional fermi line and @xmath36 is the bare fermi velocity at the fermi surface point @xmath37 .",
    "note that although we have assumed that the self - energy is only frequency dependent , for this geometry @xmath31 enters the expression for @xmath38 ( and also the normal - state resistance , see below ) .",
    "let us also note that the use of ordinary perturbation theory in deriving an expression for @xmath39 has been criticized recently @xcite .",
    "however , our formula yields the correct answer for @xmath40 .",
    "this can be shown either by an explicit solution of a @xmath41 bogoliubov problem for two coupled planes with phase differences 0 and @xmath42 between the planes , or by considering solutions to the gap equation in an infinite layered system with a finite @xmath10-axis total momentum of the cooper pairs ( for a similar calculation , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the conductance per square in the normal state is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the inverse lifetime of the quasiparticles and the index @xmath45 in the fermi line average means that the quantities are to be evaluated in the normal state .",
    "therefore standard theory predicts for the josephson product of intrinsic josephson junctions @xmath46 . in conventional superconductors @xmath3 can be measured at low temperatures in a sufficiently large magnetic field .",
    "this is impossible for the cuprates and thus @xmath3 is usually defined as the @xmath10-axis resistivity at @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , due to the unknown temperature dependence of @xmath31 , the theoretical @xmath6 can not be directly tested by experiment . in order to overcome this problem , in @xcite instead of the usual josephson product",
    "a related characteristic of intrinsic josephson junctions has been studied , namely the product of the critical current @xmath21 and of the resistivity @xmath47 in the resistive mode of the junction ( at low temperatures ) .",
    "since the conductance per square in the resistive mode of the superconductor is @xcite @xmath48 , standard bcs - like theory predicts @xmath49 . in @xcite , @xmath50 has been found experimentally and good agreement with theory has been claimed , since momentum - independent @xmath32 and @xmath31 were assumed .",
    "however , according to band structure calculations @xcite",
    ", @xmath32 is strongly suppressed in the nodal directions . if this modulation of the tunnel matrix element @xmath32 is taken into account and the presumably only moderate @xmath37-space dependence of @xmath31 is neglected , the experimental @xmath51 is seen to be drastically reduced with respect to the theoretical predictions .",
    "thus we have shown that although the barriers in grain boundaries and in intrinsic josephson junctions are of very different nature , both types of junctions exhibit a suppressed josephson product .",
    "therefore we believe that this suppression is not due to specific barrier properties as suggested in @xcite , but rather due to some intrinsic property of the high-@xmath8 superconductors .",
    "since the second harmonic @xmath52 is not forced by symmetry to depend on the angles @xmath53 , its josephson product can be estimated ( for temperatures larger than the energy of anomalous andreev levels ) using the standard bcs theory as @xmath54 .",
    "comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : walker ] ) implies that for junctions with @xmath55 the @xmath9-wave symmetry of pairing leads to a suppression of @xmath21 , and @xmath52 may become comparable to @xmath21 .",
    "this has in fact been observed in two different types of 45@xmath56 grain boundary josephson junctions @xcite .    however , the results of @xcite are quite mysterious , if we take into account the actual experimental setup .",
    "in fact , standard bcs theory with ideal featureless barriers implies that in order that @xmath57 , the average misorientation angle @xmath15 would have to be given with a precision @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this is not realistic and therefore two alternative explanations have been proposed , in both of which the origin of the anomalously large @xmath60 ratio has been sought in the barrier properties .    _",
    "( i ) faceted scenario _ has been considered as an alternative explanation for symmetric @xmath18 junctions ( i.e. junctions with nominal geometry @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , in which @xmath63 has been found @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the faceting of the grain boundary and also the twinned nature of the ( orthorhombic ) ybco thin films . due to both of these features",
    ", the junction can be viewed as a parallel set of 0 and @xmath42 junctions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in such a case spontaneous currents are generated along the interface , the ground state energy of the junction is minimized at a macroscopic phase difference @xmath64 , and consequently the current - phase relation is dominated by the second harmonic @xmath52 .    in what follows",
    "we analyze quantitatively whether the faceted scenario can apply to the results of @xcite .",
    "let us denote the current densities corresponding to the harmonics @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 ) as @xmath67 and introduce the josephson penetration depth of the junction , @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , let the local critical current density in the 0 and @xmath42 junctions be @xmath69 , their typical length @xmath70 , and the bulk penetration depth be @xmath71 . then , since @xmath72 m , @xmath73 m , and @xmath74 m ( estimated making use of @xcite @xmath75  a/@xmath76 ) , the inequalities @xmath77 and @xmath78 are well satisfied . following",
    "@xcite it is easy to show that these inequalities guarantee that the spontaneously generated currents along the josephson junction can be calculated within perturbation theory . if we denote the total junction length by @xmath79 , then a straightforward calculation yields @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the equation for @xmath38 is a random walk - type formula , indicating that @xmath38 averages to zero in a sufficiently long junction .",
    "after some algebra the above equations are seen to imply @xmath82 . therefore , standard theory predicts that @xmath83 can be realized only in sufficiently long junctions with @xmath84 .",
    "this requires @xmath85 m , whereas in @xcite much shorter junctions with @xmath86 m were studied .    _",
    "( ii ) pinhole scenario _ has been proposed in @xcite as an explanation for symmetric @xmath18 junctions ( i.e. junctions nominally characterized by @xmath87 ) .",
    "it views the barrier as basically impenetrable , the conduction being due to randomly placed highly conductive pinholes .",
    "this explains quite naturally the small value of the effective barrier transmission and , at the same time , the large value of @xmath60 .",
    "note that in order to explain the small value of the josephson product , in addition to pinholes also halbritter s conductive channels @xcite have to be postulated , which are assumed to be highly conductive only in the normal and not in the superconducting channel .",
    "because of this ad hoc nature of the pinhole scenario , and mainly because of the absence of higher harmonics in @xmath88 at 4  k @xcite whose presence it predicts , we believe that the pinhole picture should be discarded .",
    "thus we conclude that the large value of the second harmonic @xmath52 ( compared with predictions of the standard bcs theory ) is most probably not an extrinsic ( barrier - related ) effect , but rather an intrinsic property of the cuprates .",
    "the two apparently unrelated experimental facts , namely the suppressed josephson product @xmath6 and the enhanced ratio @xmath60 , can be explained by a single assumption that in the cuprates some mechanism is operative which leads to a suppression of @xmath21 , while leaving @xmath3 and @xmath52 intact . in what follows",
    "we describe one such mechanism which we believe to be the most promising one .",
    "namely , we suggest that at low temperatures the superconducting state of the cuprates supports fluctuations of pairing symmetry towards @xmath89-wave pairing ( which pairing is expected to be locally stable within several microscopic models of the cuprates ) .",
    "such fluctuations presumably do not affect @xmath3 , while they do influence the josephson current .",
    "in simplest terms , if we denote the phases of the superconducting grains forming the junction as @xmath90 , then the fluctuations renormalize the first and second harmonics by the factors @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , where @xmath30 denotes a ground - state expectation value .",
    "thus experiment requires that the fluctuations have to be of such type that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "precisely this behavior is expected if the @xmath9-wave order parameter fluctuates towards @xmath89-wave pairing .",
    "now we proceed by introducing a minimal model of such fluctuations . unlike in standard literature on this subject ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , we assign a phase field @xmath95 to each bond @xmath96 of the square cu lattice . in other words , @xmath95 lives on the sites of the dual lattice . since large phase fluctuations are expected , the compactness of phase fluctuations is explicitly taken into account and the model reads @xmath97 , \\label{eq : model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) ( with @xmath99 denoting a pair of nearest neighbor sites ) describes for @xmath100 a superconductor with a dominant @xmath9-wave pairing @xmath101 and subdominant @xmath89-wave pairing @xmath102 .",
    "since we concentrate on the @xmath103 fluctuations from @xmath9 to @xmath89-wave pairing , as a first approximation we do not take into account the coupling of phase fluctuations to electromagnetism .    in order to gain insight into the microscopics of @xmath104 , let us recall that the rvb fluctuations in an elementary plaquette ( in a hole - free region ) favor a minus sign between the two different valence bond configurations ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "if these configurations are thought of in terms of bose condensates of valence bonds , this means that energy is gained for a relative phase of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 condensates @xmath107 .",
    "rvb processes are thus seen to frustrate the phase ordering dictated by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "since the other singlet state of the elementary plaquette ( with a plus sign between the valence bond configurations ) lies higher in energy , the effective hamiltonian in the singlet sector is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 creates a singlet on bond @xmath96 . neglecting the amplitude fluctuations of @xmath110 , we can write @xmath111 . in what follows",
    "we replace @xmath104 by @xmath112 in the quantum model eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , thereby obtaining a completely classical toy model .",
    "the toy model permits a simple mean field analysis : we consider two types of solution , both of which live on two sublattices a and b , and we explicitly disregard four - sublattice solutions , since they correspond to translation - symmetry breaking states on the original cu lattice . in the first type of solution @xmath113 and @xmath114 and there are two possibilities : either @xmath115 ( @xmath9-wave ) , or @xmath116 ( a complex mixture of @xmath9 and @xmath89 , to be called @xmath117 ) . in the second type of solution",
    "we assume a disordered state of such type that on sublattice @xmath118 , the phase equals @xmath119 and @xmath42 with probabilities @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively , and on sublattice @xmath122 the values @xmath119 and @xmath42 are interchanged . in this case",
    "the macroscopic symmetry is of the @xmath9-wave type , with renormalized averages @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "minimization of energy ( with respect to @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) leads to the phase diagram shown in fig .  2 . the renormalization factor in the disordered @xmath9-wave state ( which presumably corresponds to a homogeneous but strongly fluctuating @xmath9-wave phase in the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) ) is @xmath127 .",
    "thus the cuprates correspond to the region @xmath128 and @xmath129 in fig .  2 .",
    "the anomalous effects observed in cuprate grain boundary and intrinsic josephson junctions can be explained by a single assumption of strong quantum phase fluctuations at @xmath130 , which leads to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , our picture implies that the josephson product for junctions between the cuprates and low-@xmath8 superconductors is renormalized by the factor @xmath126 , in semiquantitative agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "it also may be relevant for the experiment @xcite , where a large second harmonic has been found in a @xmath10-axis josephson junction between ybco and nb .",
