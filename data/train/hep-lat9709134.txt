    "we describe the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements that are required for the extraction of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ckm matrix elements from experimental data @xcite . to reach the bottom quark mass our strategy is to interpolate between results from relativistic quarks with @xmath3 and results from lattice hqet  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss only the hqet simulations , as our clover form factor simulations have only just started .",
    "all of our simulations use @xmath4 dynamical staggered configurations with a volume @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the isgur - wise function is the qcd matrix element required in the extraction of @xmath1 from experimental data .",
    "experimental measurements of the slope of the isgur - wise function vary from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and the variations in theoretical predictions are nearly as large  @xcite . initial attempts to calculate the isgur - wise function in lattice hqet had problems either with the signal to noise ratio  @xcite or the renormalization factors  @xcite .",
    "the first complete calculation has been done recently by the kentucky group  @xcite .",
    "we use the same method as the kentucky group ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we ran at all permutations of the following velocities : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "our sample size is @xmath13 configurations , and our wilson @xmath14 values are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a relative smearing function of @xmath17 was used between the quarks in the @xmath18 meson .",
    "-9 mm    -8 mm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : isgurwisefunc ] we plot the bare isgur - wise function for various time separations between the current and the @xmath18 source .",
    "if the ground state has been isolated , then the isgur - wise function should be independent of this separation .",
    "the data for @xmath19 are consistent within present errors .",
    "it is traditional to report the slope of the isgur - wise function as a function of the dot product of the two meson velocities ( @xmath20 ) . in table",
    "[ tb : rholinear ] we report fits to @xmath21    .preliminary fits to bare isgur - wise function data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the observation of the decay @xmath0 allows a determination of @xmath2 , if the relevant qcd form factors can be calculated .",
    "there have been a number of lattice qcd calculations of the required form factors ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however , previous approaches suffer from the drawback that calculations are done at large @xmath23 , thus requiring a large extrapolation to @xmath24 , where measurements are currently made . to reach",
    "a low @xmath23 requires large meson velocities  not easily achieved for heavy mesons in the nrqcd- or propagating - quark - approaches . as we have shown  @xcite ,",
    "a good signal can be obtained for the hqet @xmath18 meson with a large velocity ( @xmath25 ) , so we propose the use of hqet  light simulations to explore lower @xmath23 ( see  @xcite for similar ideas ) .",
    "it is not clear that hqet will be a good approximation to the dynamics of the @xmath18 meson , at these values of @xmath23 , nor that a sufficiently good signal will be obtained .",
    "however , results should be very useful in helping to reduce the heavy quark extrapolation errors over simulations that only use clover quarks .",
    "because @xmath26 light meson form factors have never been studied before using lattice hqet ( although the static limit was studied in  @xcite ) , we have computed the matrix element for @xmath0 using hqet to check for a signal .",
    "we use the setup described in  @xcite with the heavy clover quark replaced by a hqet quark . in fig .  [",
    "fig : hqetlight ] we plot the ratio of three point functions to two point functions @xmath27 that is proportional to the @xmath28 matrix element , as a function of the operator time @xmath29 .",
