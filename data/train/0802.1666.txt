    "sources discovered in surveys undertaken using 450/850 @xmath0 m scuba camera mounted on the jcmt have a high number density per unit solid angle ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 deg@xmath5 ; s@xmath6 1 mjy ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and are thought to trace the dust emission from sources at a range of redshifts .",
    "sources brighter than 1 mjy which have arp 220-like far infrared ( fir ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are ultraluminous in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 cosmology consistent with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and type 1a sne observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) unless they are at redshifts @xmath10 1 so that , thus far , submillimeter surveys do not detect `` normal '' galaxies at high redshift .",
    "this should be the case even for gravitational lens amplification up to a factor of 4 for 2 mjy limit surveys .",
    "it is therefore a sensible approach to consider the properties of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xcite ) as a guide to understanding sources detected in submillimeter surveys with the proviso that the high redshift universe may not conserve these properties .",
    "it has already been noted that the number density of ulirgs increases with redshift at a rate much larger than can be explained using geometric considerations alone ( @xcite ) and deep field observations using the _ hubble space telescope _ have found quite obvious morphological evolution at higher redshifts compared to local conditions ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "while these particular evidences of evolution as a function of redshift do not directly speak to ulirg sed evolution , they do suggest that this proviso can not be lightly discounted .",
    "ice is present in the dense ism of the galaxy .",
    "it is observed to occur above a threshold depth of a@xmath11 3 within molecular clouds but is absent on the cloud edges and in the diffuse ( atomic / ionized ) ism ( @xcite ) . because ice is not exposed to star light , far infrared ( fir ) emission from ice is not expected from quiescent clouds .",
    "the fir emission from these ice bearing clouds arises from the first few ice - free a@xmath12 . to observe ice emission in the galaxy ,",
    "centrally heated sources are needed .",
    "if mid - infrared ( mir ) radiation can illuminate the ice bearing grains so that they may be heated , then the fir emission will be dominated by ice if the ice mantles provide a moderate fraction of the total grain volume .",
    "this fir dominance is owing to greater fir opacity of ice relative to silicate or carbonaceous grains . in the models presented by @xcite , a mantle - to - core volume ratio of 0.33",
    "doubles the 60 @xmath0 m opacity : a 10% increase in grain radius doubles the opacity",
    "!    protostars in the galaxy which are centrally heated turn out to be good sources for observing fir ice emission ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . and",
    ", there is mounting evidence that a significant fraction of local ulirgs are also centrally heated ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) so that the fir emission is a result of mir heating .",
    "thus , if ice is present in the fir emitting regions , its effects on the fir opacity may be important .",
    "this situation differs from what occurs in lower luminosity starburst galaxies where the fir emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds which are heated by optical and far uv rather than mir light",
    ". the interiors of the clouds , where ice presumably exists , are not strongly heated by the mainly fir emission arising from their surfaces .",
    "if submillimeter galaxies are similar to ulirgs in more than just their luminosity , then they may also sometimes have fir emission that is powered by mir light . for redshift estimation",
    "the question of the similarity between submillimeter galaxies and local ulirgs is as important as the differences that distinguish ulirgs from their lower luminosity starburst counterparts .",
    "attempts to estimate redshifts for the submillimeter sources based on their radio fluxes could be guided by local ulirg samples .",
    "for the 13 ulirgs brighter than 5.24 jy at 60 @xmath0 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) available to the vla , the mean logarithm of the ratio of fir - to-20 cm radio flux is 0.22 dex larger than @xmath13=2.43@xmath140.19 ( @xcite ) for starburst galaxies when calculated using radio measurements reported by @xcite and @xcite . while the mean differs at only the 1@xmath15 level , the dispersion of @xmath13 is a factor 1.6 ( in dex ) larger than for the lower luminosity star forming galaxies . using a different luminosity binning ,",
    "@xcite report a similar trend in increased dispersion with increasing luminosity .",
    "the implication for redshift estimation is that the range of likely redshifts would increase when using ulirg properties rather than starburst properties . and",
    ", a trend away from what is seen in local ulirgs , say through more powerful starbursts at earlier times , could have complex implications for estimating redshifts of submillimeter galaxies using radio observations .",
    "however , broad limits on the redshift distribution derive from submillimeter observations alone where the relative infrequency of detecting 450 @xmath0 m emission leads to ( weak ) lower limits on the redshifts while the detections themselves at 850 @xmath0 m lead to upper limits since , baring extraordinary luminosities , the turnover from the rayleigh - jeans - like portion of the sed at high redshift leads to source fluxes dropping below survey detection limits .",
    "given the large potential effect of ice on the fir opacity of submillimeter galaxies , we first review the evidence for the presence of ice in centrally heated ulirgs and estimate an expected fir sed for a case where fir ice opacity can be expected to be dominant based on a rough abundance analysis .",
    "we then search for fir ice spectral features in the available data on ulirgs .",
    "we discuss why a high relative abundance of ice during the epoch of reionization might be expected and present somewhat firmer evidence for fir ice emission in the @xmath2 source qso j1148 + 5251 than can yet be demonstrated for ulirgs .",
    "we then take the submillimeter galaxy hdf 850.1 as an example to show how fir ice emission allows a very large redshift estimate .",
    "observations of strong absorption features from refractory dust in ulirgs trace dust that is cooler than the temperature of a blackbody emitting at the wavelength of the feature : @xmath3 300 k for the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature and @xmath3 150 k for the 20 @xmath0 m silicate feature for example .",
    "thus , 20 @xmath0 m silicate features are weak in ulirgs compared to 10 @xmath0 m features owing to the dust radial temperature gradient .",
    "ice absorption , on the other hand , should only occur in the cooler outer regions of the dust envelope and so may show the same relative feature strengths found in the laboratory unless the absorbing covering factor is a strong function of the emitting source s wavelength dependent size ( buried source radius @xmath16 pc where t has been eliminated between the wein displacement and stefan - boltzmann laws , @xmath17 is the portion of ir luminosity corrected for extended star formation , @xmath18 runs from 2 @xmath0 m to the lesser of either the wavelength where the source is no longer optically thick or the peak fir wavelength and scattering is neglected ) .",
    "mir ice absorption is therefore consistent with a portion of the fir emission being powered by the mir rather than the optical and uv portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "however , it is necessary to be certain that the reported absorption is indeed owing to ice . as an example , @xcite claim ice absorption in 18 galaxies based on 6 @xmath0 m absorption including iras 17208 - 0014 the third brightest ulirg .",
    "however oh bond bending need nt occur in ice alone .",
    "the absence of 3 @xmath0 m absorption in the spectra of the dust continuum dominated sources mkn 231 and iras 05189 - 2524 presented by @xcite , where veiling by starlight is unimportant , suggests that an identification of water ice may be premature for these sources and refractory materials such as those studied by @xcite may provide a more convincing model . an apparent 6 @xmath0 m dip in the spectrum of mkn 231 plotted by @xcite similar in amplitude to the 6.2 @xmath0 m hump for which they report",
    "a measurement tends to confirm the @xcite claim of 6 @xmath0 m absorption in this source .",
    "the spectrum of arp 220 may be consistent with a contribution of 12.5 @xmath0 m libration mode absorption , supportive of the @xcite identification of ice absorption in this source but , until recently ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the only well confirmed case of ice absorption among ulirgs in their sample was that of iras 00188 - 0856 where ice absorption at 3 @xmath0 m confirms the identification ( @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for further well confirmed ice identifications .    to illustrate this we present fig . 1 which employs a slightly detailed model to explain the absorption features observed between 2.7 and 12.4 @xmath0 m .",
    "the upper panel reproduces the 3 @xmath0 m spectrum reported by @xcite together with an absorption model composed of amorphous ice and refractory carbonaceous absorption applied to a power - law continuum , and veiled by some starburst - like emission .",
    "the model is then applied in the lower panel with some adjustment made for expected reduced refractory absorption at longer wavelengths owing to a presumed dust temperature gradient .",
    "it has not been possible to fit the entire 3 @xmath0 m absorption without using ice .",
    "thus , the absorption at 6 @xmath0 m also is partly attributed to water ice . with these data , 12.5 @xmath0 m water ice absorption , while included in the model , does not seem to be required so that one may conclude that two features , and particularly the degeneracy breaking short wavelength edge of the 3 @xmath0 m absorption contribute to the fairly robust identification of ice in iras 00188 - 0856 .",
    "we note that the need for strong silicate absorption in this source is confirmed by the clear presence of 18 @xmath0 m silicate absorption ( @xcite )    thus , ice absorption could play a significant role in ulirgs , but the evidence is not yet as strong as that showing that the mir emission is often absorbed by refractory dust .",
    "evidence for or against fir ice emission or absorption in ulirgs is in worse shape still .",
    "this is primarily owing to a lack of observational data . in fig .",
    "2 we present archival iso lws spectra of mkn 231 ( filled diamonds ) and iras 17208 - 0014 ( filled circles ) which show spectral structure in the shortest wavelength detector band sw 1 .",
    "this structure is compared to the spectrum of the icy source hd 161796 ( @xcite ) transformed to absorption .",
    "for mkn 231 , as just noted , the absence of 3 @xmath0 m ice absorption would lead to somewhat strained geometric arguments to allow acceptance of the @xcite identification of the 6 @xmath0 m absorption , but once made , such arguments would likely allow absorption at even longer wavelengths .",
    "a complex geometry has already been invoked for this source on a smaller physical scale to explain its low x - ray flux ( @xcite ) . for iras 17208 - 0014",
    ", the present spectrum would tend to confirm the @xcite identification of the 6 @xmath0 m absorption as do 3 @xmath0 m spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for either source , the presence of crystalline ice implied by the possible 43 @xmath0 m absorption would imply a low cosmic ray abundance at least in the region where the absorption is produced since ion bombardment erases crystalline structure in cold ices ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "2 shows the relationship between the wavelength of the 43 @xmath0 m peak and ice temperature measured by @xcite which we have invoked to shift the ice spectrum derived from hd 161796 , an evolved ice forming star ( @xcite ) , beyond the corrections made for the source redshifts to better match the spectra .",
    "inversion of these corrections would imply temperatures at which amorphous ice may exist and would be preferentially formed . constraints on cosmic ray abundance would need account for the rate at which crystalline ice is introduced into the absorbing region either through ( substantial ) changes in luminosity of the source which may allow the annealing of amorphous ice to crystalline ice , processing of ice by local heat sources in the region , or the migration of crystalline ice into the region .",
    "the discovery of substantial radial molecular gas motion in the ulirg iras 08572 + 3915 ( @xcite ) suggests the third possibility needs close scrutiny .",
    "since the sw1 detector of lws is problematic , these sources must be independently re - observed and the potential features confirmed before fully accepting that ice is present in these sources .",
    "we have examined the lws sw1 spectra of a two other ulirgs , arp 220 and mkn 273 , finding no feature consistent with crystalline ice absorption . in the case of arp 220",
    ", the fir spectrum appears to be optically thick ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is every reason to think ice should be present owing to the source temperature , the clear presence of water vapor , as well as supportive mir observations already mentioned . here",
    ", ice may help to resolve an issue raised by @xcite with regard to fir sources that are optically thick showing any detectable emission in the mir owing to overwhelmingly large implied mir opacity .",
    "since ice strongly enhances the fir opacity compared to refractory dust , a given fir optical depth can be achieved with less dust , up to a factor of seven in the models computed by @xcite .",
    "this effect can make the issue raised by @xcite less troubling , though other approaches such as examining the effects of the dust density distribution ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) may also need to be explored as well .",
    "ice may also have the effect of making millimeter continuum size estimates smaller than what might be expected for refractory dust that is optically thick in the fir since the opacity of ice mantled grains is lower than that of bare grains at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this could yield a cuspy morphology in the millimeter where one would usually expect a relatively more flattened morphology owing to the cooler outer regions being relatively brighter in the millimeter under the assumption of higher refractory dust opacity .",
    "the infrared laboratory spectrum of crystalline water ice has been well known for some time ( @xcite ) and differences between the spectrum of crystalline and amorphous ice have been exploited to aid understanding of astronomical sources ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . however owing to the low thermal conductivity of amorphous ice , preparation of laboratory samples , via vapor deposition , that are thick enough to conduct investigations at wavelengths longer than 100 @xmath0 m has been too difficult until recently . in particular",
    "it has been unknown whether or not amorphous ice has a feature corresponding to the broad feature centered near 150 @xmath0 m identified by @xcite as a phonon mode in crystalline ice .",
    "since nature provides sources rich in amorphous ice , it may be that such a comparison could be made through observations of these sources .",
    "the spectral coverage of the iso lws spectrometer extended to @xmath3 200 @xmath0 m , too short to fully cover the broad 150 @xmath0 m crystalline ice feature . comparison between the iso lws data presented by @xcite for rafgl 7009s , a deeply embedded ultracompact region , and the submillimeter observations provided by @xcite yield a modified optically thin blackbody parameter set of t=27 k , @xmath19=2.1 ( where the dust emissivity is proportional to @xmath20 ) when attempting to the match data near 190 @xmath0 m .",
    "the large value of @xmath19 is suggestive of the presence of a feature similar to that of crystalline ice in this amorphous ice dominated source .",
    "however , full spectroscopic confirmation is needed to decide if the long wavelength departure of the data from the model of @xcite indicates the existence of an amorphous ice feature analogous to the 150 @xmath0 m crystalline ice feature .",
    "laboratory work by @xcite has explored the optical properties of amorphous ice between 15 and 200 @xmath0 m .",
    "there is little question that most of the ice in the thick films used by @xcite deposited at @xmath21 k differs from ice deposited above this temperature since the wing of the libration band is clearly shifted so it seems safe to conclude that amorphous ice , clearly present in the thinner samples , is also largely present in the thicker samples despite issues related to the low thermal conductivity of amorphous ice which hampers the ( rapid ) growth of thick samples .",
    "@xcite have also had recent success in growing thick samples of amorphous ice using low deposition rates .",
    "@xcite take a different approach : annealing samples of high density amorphous ice into the low density amorphous ice found in space .",
    "as with the lws spectroscopy , the new amorphous ice optical constants ( @xcite ) do not extend to the wavelength regime ( 300 @xmath0 m ) where crystalline ice shows absorption whose wavelength dependence is described by @xmath22 ( @xcite ) . unlike natural sources , however , where temperature and grain size effects make full spectral coverage of a broad feature nearly absolutely necessary to ascertain its reality , the controlled laboratory conditions allow a reasonable extrapolation to be considered reliable .",
    "the finding of @xcite that the imaginary part of the refractive indices of amorphous and crystalline ice are very similar between 100 and 200 @xmath0 m would appear to be consistent with the suggestion of @xcite that the order in amorphous ice indicated by sharp features in inelastic x - ray scattering data may be owing to a hydrogen network that is also present in crystalline ice . if this order is indeed present , then a shared spectral structure for the interaction of ( fir ) photons with phonons between the two types would allow a first order substitution of crystalline ice optical constants for the unknown values for amorphous ice beyond 200 @xmath0 m .      turning to photometry , and returning to ulirgs ,",
    "if we accept the @xcite classification scheme then the spectrum of iras 14348 - 1447 as reported by @xcite or @xcite must be considered class ii , that is 6 @xmath0 m `` ice '' absorption is present and partially filled in by 6.2 @xmath0 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission .",
    "this source occupies an extreme position in the dust emissivity ( @xmath19 ) vs. 100 @xmath0 m optical depth ( @xmath23 ) diagram given by @xcite with both high @xmath23 ( 5 ) and @xmath19 ( 2 ) .",
    "since the effects of optical depth and emissivity are intertwined , a lower optical depth can imply a larger value of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , @xmath24 and @xmath25 does about as well as the @xcite parameters for data longward of 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , values of @xmath19 larger than 2 are not generally found except where ice is thought to be present ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) or dust temperatures are lower than found in ulirgs ( 67 k for the @xcite fit or 26 k at the lower optical depth and larger @xmath19 tested here ) . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the fit proposed for iras 14348 - 1447 by @xcite with an alternative model .",
    "the model shown by the dashed line is that of @xcite , while that shown by the thick solid line is a core - mantle grain model taken from @xcite but modified to have amorphous ice features in the following way : first , opacity data from @xcite for crystalline ice cooled to 70 k was matched to the @xcite curve for v@xmath26/v@xmath27=0.95 by inducing a @xmath28 dependence to approximate the mie calculation results along with the addition of an underlying continuum opacity .",
    "second , amorphous ice opacity data ( @xcite ; deposited at 10 k and warmed to 70 k ) was substituted between 30 and 70 @xmath0 m based on this matching after adjustment for the differing sample thicknesses .",
    "this opacity curve was used to calculate a model with 16 and 71 k components .",
    "if we take temperature and optical depth as free parameters for the @xcite fit ( 2 parameters ; normalization fixed by iras ) and two temperatures , two optical depths , and the relative contribution at 90 @xmath0 m of these two components as 5 free parameters for the present model then we may estimate how well the two models represent the data if we know something about the errors in the data .",
    "the statistical errors for the data are thought to be small but the absolute calibration error could be large , @xmath330% .",
    "what is important for comparing models is the relative accuracy from filter to filter .",
    "we have thus assumed 13% errors for the isophot data to give a filter - to - filter accuracy of 20% ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fit of @xcite for data longward of 20 @xmath0 m is unacceptable ( p(@xmath29,@xmath30)=0.02 ) under our assumption about the errors .",
    "a marginally acceptable fit ( p(@xmath29,@xmath30)=0.4 ) is found for the amorphous ice model .",
    "detailed inspection of the ice fit suggests that the 150 @xmath0 m ice feature is not accounting for all of structure in the data .",
    "the thin solid line ( v@xmath26/v@xmath27=0.33 , t=28.8 k ; @xmath31 and v@xmath26/v@xmath27=0.95 , t=80.5 k , @xmath32 crystalline ice ; onion - skin model with warm , t=180 k , refractory dust in the interior ) shows that this might be possible .",
    "however , our method of substituting amorphous for crystalline ice is unlikely to work well for the thin mantle used here",
    ". given the assumption regarding the data errors made here , it is not possible to make a clear claim that ice emission is detected in this source .",
    "assuming larger errors could make both low free parameter models acceptable while reducing the errors could make the simpler ice model unacceptable while the more complex model can not be evaluated via reduced @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , _ spitzer _",
    "mips sed mode observations could be definitive since the strong 70 @xmath0 m curvature in the ice models can not be produced with standard refractory dust .",
    "thus , both astronomical and laboratory far infrared data leave questions about ice unanswered .",
    "crystalline ice has a feature near 150 @xmath0 m which has yet to be completely compared with amorphous ice .",
    "comparison between crystalline and amorphous ice has been made near 40 and 60 @xmath0 m and they are quite distinct whereas they are similar between 100 and 200 @xmath0 m . beyond 200 @xmath0 m questions",
    "remain which are presently answered by extrapolation of the laboratory data and hints from the astronomical data .",
    "substituting crystalline ice for more common ( in space ) amorphous ice to consider wavelengths longer than 100 @xmath0 m could add to ( systematic ) uncertainties in photometric redshift estimation that can not be well addressed without further observations or measurements .",
    "regardless of the remaining issues concerning the 150 @xmath0 m feature , for the main purpose of this work it is prudent to consider the more extreme consequences of crystalline ice emission on redshift estimation which are examined after the next section .",
    "just as interplanetary grains may preserve a record of the sources of ism enrichment occurring at what is presently observed to be @xmath33 , the solid phase of the ism at high redshift may also record the conditions of the earliest enrichment . particularly for sources that contribute to the reionization of the universe ( @xmath34 ; @xcite )",
    ", scenarios which attribute substantial enrichment to pair instability sne early on may leave a mark on the solid phase of the ism which could linger through some subsequent processing .",
    "a chief attribute of pair instability sn enrichment is an early high abundance of oxygen relative to other metals that usually deplete to the the solid phase of the ism .",
    "for example , a 186 m@xmath35 progenitor yields number abundance ratios of o : si : c : s : mg:@xmath36ni = 126:29:15:10:8:1 ( @xcite ) which , after formation of co ( 29 o removed ) , olivine ( 16 o and 4 si removed ) , silica ( 50 o removed ) , and so@xmath37 ( 20 o removed ) , leaves 9% of the oxygen available to form oh and h@xmath37o . for a 100 m@xmath35 progenitor ,",
    "o : c : mg=48:9:1 with little si , s or @xmath36ni leaving 80% of the oxygen available to combine with hydrogen assuming the refractory solid state is mgo . in the absence of @xmath36ni ,",
    "the formation of solids should be enhanced since it may commence at a higher density in the snr .",
    "these estimates for the available oxygen are essentially lower limits , more complete treatments which consider the possibility that the ejecta are unmixed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; allowing the formation of graphite for example ) would leave an even larger fraction of oxygen available . thus , we might expect grains with large mantle - to - core volume ratios to result from a period of pair instability sn enrichment .",
    "the continued presence of these ice grains would depend on the rate of reprocessing of this initial solid phase in the ism .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough in qso j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath2 ; @xcite ) suggests that this source may be participating in the last phases of reionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "that the quasar exists indicates that the source has been contributing to reionization for some time and we may take the beginning of reionization as an estimate of it s age ( @xmath3500 myr ) which gives a high average accretion rate for a blackhole mass of @xmath38 m@xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that pair instability sn enriched material with a high ice content is being supplied toward the center of this activity as the blackhole and presumably its stellar system grow in mass . on the other hand",
    ", ice also forms in the more evolved ism of the galaxy so an indication of the presence of ice need nt be fully attributed to ice rich regions that might be formed by pair instability sne .",
    "4 shows an indication that the rest frame fir emission from qso j1148 + 5251 is better explained by ice than refractory dust emission .",
    "three models are compared to photometric observations : 1 ) a refractory model ( dashed line t=55 k ; @xmath39 ; @xmath40 ) is similar to that given by @xcite , 2 ) a simple ice model ( dot - dashed line ; t=43 k ; @xmath41 , v@xmath26/v@xmath27=5.6 amorphous ) , and 3 ) a more complex ice model described below ( solid line ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , it is not possible to formally access the goodness of fit through a reduced @xmath42 calculation even for the refractory dust model ( dashed line ) since the number of free parameters ( normalization , temperature , optical depth , and opacity index ) is the same as the number of points to be fit . if one were to assume @xmath40 owing to insufficient time since the first enrichment to produce large grains then",
    "@xmath43 which strongly rules out ( p(@xmath44)=0.001 ) this model . that the fit is done by eye probably does not affect this assessment but a failure to account for systematic errors could since different groups give 850 @xmath0 m photometric estimates using the same data that vary by as much as the refractory dust model differs from the present data .",
    "by selecting a particular mantle - to - core volume ratio ( 5.6 ) we may comparably provide a single degree of freedom and obtain @xmath45 ( dot - dashed line ) which would indicate that the model is not fully ruled out by the data ( p(@xmath44)=0.05 ) and is an improvement on the refractory dust model , again with the proviso that we have only considered statistical errors .",
    "more elaborate ( multi - temperature ) refractory dust or ice mantled grain models can fit the detections essentially perfectly and are useful to calculate as they can indicate what further observations would be decisive .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "4 is such a model where t=71 k ; @xmath41 ice - mantled dust is obscured by t=24 k ; @xmath41 ice - mantled dust .",
    "a similar model using @xmath40 refractory dust ( not plotted ; t=300 k ; @xmath46 is obscured by t=18 k ; @xmath47 dust ) exceeds the plotted 400 @xmath0 m upper limit ( arrow in fig .",
    "4 ; 0.39 mjy 3@xmath15 ; @xcite ) by a factor of 1.9 and is unphysical in a number of ways including that the cool component is cooler than the cmb at @xmath2 .",
    "the ice models distinguish themselves from the plotted refractory dust model by being fainter by at least a factor of 4 at rest wavelength 400 @xmath0 m ( 3 mm observed frame ) .",
    "the present upper limit does not distinguish these cases . such a measurement should be possible using carma . determining the composition of the emitting material can also affect estimates of the dust mass and thus estimates of the amount of past enrichment ( and star formation ) in the qso j1148 + 5251 system .",
    "for the present ice model , 7 times as much refractory dust would be needed to produce the same fir opacity so that a lower level of total enrichment might be accommodated .    finally , at high redshift , where theory suggests that we might most anticipate it owing to expectations about early ism enrichment",
    ", we find evidence for fir ice emission which , while still debatable , seems moderately persuasive and which can be relatively easily checked with further observations using existing telescopes .",
    "now we may turn to our main theme .",
    "we have employed amorphous ice to consider iras 14348 - 1447 and qso j1148 + 5251 , but now we consider crystalline ice both because its effect on redshift estimation is the most dramatic and because ice may form at fairly warm temperatures in the snrs associated with pair instability sne .",
    "a set of sources that could be at high redshift and which demonstrate the effects of ice are reported by @xcite .",
    "they are detected at 450 @xmath0 m but not at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "we consider the 7 sources tabulated by @xcite and two sources from the original list of @xcite which were recovered above 3.5 @xmath15 by @xcite .",
    "these have drawn our attention because the reported 850 @xmath0 m upper limits indicate large values of @xmath19 ( @xcite ; based on original list ) .",
    "large values of @xmath19 can indicate the presence of ice emission .",
    "if we generate 3@xmath15 lower limits to the 450-to-850 @xmath0 m flux density ratios using the 450 @xmath0 m measurements less 3/@xmath48 together with 3/@xmath49 850 @xmath0 m upper limits then the lowest lower limit is 8.7 and is only one of two that can be consistent with @xmath50 dust .",

    "1 ) , the model for t=150 k ice is 10 times more luminous still , and we have also plotted the complex amorphous ice model for qso j1148 + 5251 at it s observed luminosity ( short dashed line and filled circle ; @xmath70 l@xmath35 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the brightnesses of the 450 @xmath0 m sources given by @xcite lie in the range 77-to-291 mjy so that the plotted models would need to be scaled up by a factor of a few to cover this range fully unless the sources are at @xmath71 .",
    "for example , one of the brighter sources ( smm j123631 + 620657 ; 263 mjy ) would have a luminosity of 6@xmath72 l@xmath35 for the t = 150 k ice model if located at @xmath58 , a factor of three higher than the most luminous hyperluminous source listed by @xcite .",
    "it s luminosity would be 10 times lower for the t = 30 k ice model located at @xmath73 , near the middle of the distribution of luminosities in their list . from fig .",
    "5 we estimate that the 450 @xmath0 m sources would populate the redshift ranges 13 and 510 , with the latter range having a larger comoving volume by a factor of 1.7 . if ice is only important close to reionization so that the sources were all at 9.2@xmath74 ( see solid line in fig .",
    "6 ) then the luminosities require about a tenth of the stellar mass of m87 per source to be involved in star formation .",
    "the space density would be 2.5@xmath75 mpc@xmath76 , comparable to the local density of clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) and the luminosity density would be @xmath77 l@xmath35/mpc@xmath78 ( comoving ) , about a factor of 100 higher than the local fir value ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would then imply a minimum of 10@xmath78 recombinations per proton if the 450 @xmath0 m luminosity traces a factor of ten smaller ionizing luminosity : about 10@xmath79 more recombinations than for the lifetime of a typical region which seems too high for reionization unless dust competes efficiently for reionizing photons",
    ".    on the other hand , there are six 850 @xmath0 m sources with flux densities above 20 mjy listed by pope et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which could be close to hyperluminous ( see fig .",
    "7 ) so that we need only postulate a similar population which is ( thus far ) invisible a 850 @xmath0 m owing to the effects of ice and thus expect to find these sources at a range of redshifts .    there is very clear evidence of ice rather than dust providing the fir opacity in 7 of the 9 450 @xmath0 m sources considered here .",
    "but , the redshifts may or may not be high and additional photometry is needed to constrain the redshifts .",
    "the search for counterparts at other wavelengths to the brightest 850 @xmath0 m source in the hubble deep field has been arduous but @xcite make a convincing case for detections in the radio and near infrared ( nir ) and summarize submillimeter observations .",
    "modeling ( @xcite ) of these observations leads them to conclude that the redshift of hdf 850.1 lies in the range 4.1@xmath140.5 .",
    "since the sed of a high @xmath13 ulirg ( iras 08572 + 3915 ) is included in the 20 templates in the model input , the effects of the change in the radio - fir relation for ulirgs compared to lower luminosity galaxies noted in the introduction should be partly represented in their estimate .",
    "similarly , the suggestion of ice emission in the sed of iras 14348 - 1447 ( fig .",
    "3 ) could also influence the estimate if the photometric data were used directly rather than fitted with a modified blackbody .",
    "in general , reliance on modified blackbodies will give lower estimated redshifts for cooler sources when more than one point on the rayleigh - jeans curve is available , as is the case for hdf 850.1 , but the addition of an ice emission feature can increase the estimated redshift even for a cool source .    as one example , the bow - tie shown in fig .",
    "1 on the fir continuum corresponds to the range of redshift one would calculate for hdf 850.1 based on two estimates of its 850 @xmath0 m flux density ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the 1.3 mm flux density reported by @xcite .",
    "that is 5.4 @xmath815.6 .",
    "it should be noted , even before describing the model upon which this is based , that a detailed comparison between the sed shown in fig . 1 and the optical and nir limits and detections for hdf 850.1 is not possible owing to insufficient wavelength coverage for iras 00188 - 0856 .",
    "see @xcite fig . 6 for a comparison with data from two ulirgs and a luminous infrared galaxy calculated for a range of redshifts .",
    "however , the effects of far infrared ice emission can be demonstrated with this example .",
    "the model , the short - dashed line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 , is based on curves given by @xcite which are the results of calculations of the optical properties of ice mantled crystalline silicate grains . and , it is crystalline water ice in the mantles .",
    "we chose the mantle - to - core volume ratio = 5.6 curve to most closely match the ratio of 3 @xmath0 m ice to silicate optical depth used in the model shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 . for a number of reasons",
    "this choice is probably not fully constrained by this ratio : the optical depth to which the silicate absorption is sensitive may be larger than for ice ; an odd shift in the wavelength of the silicate feature may indicate a pyroxene composition with a different feature - to - continuum optical depth ratio than usual ; the crystalline silicate in the @xcite calculation is somewhat dissimilar to astrophysical silicate models .",
    "however the first two effects may be compensating so that as a rough abundance analysis , the expectation that ice would dominate the fir opacity in this source seems well founded .",
    "this condition , and the need for the ice emission to be moderately optically thin are really the only two requirements for ice to strongly affect redshift estimation .",
    "the optical depth of the model of far infrared emission shown in the lower panel of fig . 1 is set to correspond to the 3 @xmath0 m ice optical depth used in models shown by the solid line in the upper panel ( where ice and refractory material contribute equally to the absorption optical depth at 3.1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the temperature of the far infrared emission model is set to roughly reproduce the iras 60 and 100 @xmath0 m measurements .",
    "this temperature also accentuates the effects of the broad 150 @xmath0 m feature over which the hdf 850.1 data are displayed .",
    "the range of redshifts needed to place hdf 850.1 on this model falls outside of the range estimated by @xcite and gives a first indication that the effects of ice on photometric redshift estimation ( as opposed to just limits ) can be significant .      as noted in the introduction ,",
    "using local ulirgs to understand submillimeter sources is a sensible approach if their properties are not strongly affected by cosmic evolution .",
    "however , at higher redshift , this proviso seems fairly likely to break down .",
    "many local ulirgs appear to be produced in the mergers of gas rich spiral galaxies and it has been argued ( @xcite ) that the dynamical stability provided by bulges may preserve gas reservoirs for the final merger stages associated with some ulirgs . owing to the finite lifetime of the universe ,",
    "there are earlier periods when the precursor systems may not resemble present day precursors in their dynamical state or star - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "it is not at all clear that seed smbhs ( @xcite ) would be present at sufficient mass to allow accretion to be an energetically important or dominant power source as suspected for local ulirgs ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in what follows we assume star formation as the main power source at higher redshift .",
    "a sketch of how crystalline ice might exist in a primordial galaxy environment is also given to explore the plausibility of a very large effect of ice on redshift estimation .",
    "it is to be noted that giving up a central power source such as would be provided by an agn would usually mean that ice mantled grains would contribute little to the fir emission since most of the energy that powers fir emission would be absorbed in reactive photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) rather than in molecular clouds where ice is thought to exist unless an improbable scenario involving an overabundance of protostars such as that proposed by @xcite but previously discounted by @xcite is invoked .",
    "below we argue for such an overabundance .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the observations of hdf 850.1 at @xmath83 this is 18 confidence intervals beyond the @xcite estimate .",
    "so far as we can tell , neither the new @xmath84 band upper limit reported here , nor the released _",
    "irac and mips goods images ( @xcite ) rule out either the model shown in fig . 7 or",
    "the analysis of @xcite so long as a reddish ulirg ( see @xcite for a discussion of 12-to-60 @xmath0 m flux density ratios in ulirgs ) is used as a basis for the @xcite analysis .",
    "@xcite argue that the lensing source ( solid diamonds in fig .",
    "7 ) is evolved , in which case much of the tentative observed frame 24 @xmath0 m flux density could be owing to hdf 850.1 but little of the 8 @xmath0 m flux density . at @xmath85",
    ", mkn 231 and 273 could be too blue to account for this level of emission whereas arp 220 or iras 17208 - 0014 would not violate this datum if treated as an upper limit .",
    "on the other hand , at @xmath86 the chances of finding a younger elliptical galaxy to act as a lens are increased so that some or all of the observed 24 @xmath0 m flux density could be owing to the lensing galaxy .",
    "this would still not rule out the @xcite redshift estimate for hdf 850.1 but would accommodate the present estimate under the assumption of the plotted starburst model .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "7 shows a possible range for the spectral shape of the lens source emission .",
    "the source labeled 1b in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite may also contribute to the 24 @xmath0 m emission though only slightly to the irac data .",
    "if it is similar to ngc 253 , and at a redshift of @xmath87 ( @xcite ) then up to @xmath330% of the 24 @xmath0 m flux density might be attributed to this source but again negligibly at 850 @xmath0 m .    the model for hdf 850.1 shown in fig .",
    "7 ( thick gray line ) is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "1 in that it has the same mantle - to - core volume ratio and optical depth however the temperature is higher as it must be owing to the higher cmb temperature at @xmath83 . whereas in fig .",
    "1 , the 150 @xmath0 m ice feature spectral structure influences the redshift placement of the hdf 850.1 data , in fig . 7 , shorter wavelength spectral structure also owing to ice is influential . interestingly , assuming that there is a foreground neutral intergalactic medium as a result of incomplete reionization ( @xcite ) , one would expect gunn - peterson saturation or a ly@xmath88 blackout to occur in the @xmath89 band for @xmath83 the shortest wavelength band for which hdf 850.1 is detected .",
    "this is represented by the change from black to gray in the thin line using a heaviside function as multiplier . here",
    "the thin line is a young starburst spectrum generated using starburst99 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is notable that taking the onset in redshift of the gunn - peterson trough to be @xmath36 ( @xcite ) absorption at the lyman limit at @xmath90 easily overlaps ly@xmath88 absorption between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "one expects pretty thorough opacity shortward of ly@xmath88 .    while the choices of parameters of the starburst model are meant only to be suggestive , for the model shown in fig .",
    "7 , the free - free emission expected based on the rate of production of ionizing photons would explain about 20% of the observed radio emission ( following @xcite ) while retaining the starburst model as it is and correcting for sufficient extinction to account for the model infrared emission would over produce the radio emission so that a lower contribution of stars which produce ionizing photons to the observed frame @xmath93 band flux might provide a more likely scenario .",
    "alternatively , invoking a chemical trigger for star formation discussed below , it is conceivable that an object could be caught in a phase when a sufficient number of stars are in an ultracompact region configuration that , given a sufficiently high ionization parameter , higher than usually required if the gas - to - dust mass ratio is high owing to low enrichment , free - free emission would be suppressed ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    as noted in the introduction , sources at high redshift should eventually drop out of 850 @xmath0 m surveys . in fig .",
    "8 we plot , for the same far infrared luminosity , the expected 850 @xmath0 m brightness as a function of redshift for an arp 220-like sed and the two distributions shown in figs . 1 and 7 .",
    "the 30 k model is truncated at @xmath94 since the cosmic background radiation temperature exceeds the model temperature above this redshift . as can be seen , the models with ice select for high redshift sources assuming such sources exist . for the 30 k model the brightest ( non - local ) source",
    "would be found near a redshift of 5 and for the 50 k model near a redshift of 13 .",
    "should ice play the role proposed here in a moderate fraction of the detected 850 @xmath0 m sources , it would be of little surprise that the brightest source in the hdf ( 850.1 ) would be among them",
    ".      our choice of presenting a model that uses star formation as a power source may seem strange given that pdrs would be inefficient at producing ice emission which we require to allow , for example , hdf 850.1 to be detected at @xmath82 .",
    "one phase of star formation that does allow mir radiation to heat ice is the protostar phase .",
    "this phase is brief compared to o star life times and thus would not typically be expected to provide the dominant source of fir radiation in a galaxy .",
    "protogalaxies , however , are by definition required to be young , so that while the argument concerning the relative brevity of the protostar phase can not be ignored , it may be overcome if the star formation rate is increasing rapidly with time . and , it is just such sources that one might expect to be observed as they populate the top of the infrared luminosity function since they would be the most efficient at converting radiation to fir wavelengths .",
    "a rapidly increasing star formation rate might be expected in a situation where the gas cooling efficiency is increasing owing to ongoing initial enrichment .",
    "a positive feedback can lead to an exponentially increasing system response .",
    "the number at the right hand of fig .",
    "8 shows the 850 brightness ( in mjy ) of the three sed shapes considered here if we adopt the lensing amplification proposed by @xcite for hdf 850.1 for a source with the fir luminosity of iras 00188 - 0856 . the increase in luminosity required to match the @xcite estimate for hdf 850.1 would be a factor of 2.3 for the dashed curve taken at a redshift of 13",
    "this would then correspond to @xmath95 l@xmath35 ( _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "7 ) or 10@xmath96 o stars and 1.5@xmath97 g0 stars for a salpeter initial mass function ( m@xmath98 ) , or roughly a galaxy s worth of star formation .",
    "this then would be the limit for the continued exponential increase in the star formation rate : the amount of available enrichable gas .",
    "night et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find 4 objects with @xmath99 m@xmath35 in stars at @xmath91 in their largest cosmological simulation ( 142 mpc ; large enough to contain @xmath31 ulirg at @xmath100 ) .",
    "thus , there is some suggestion that relatively massive objects ( or perhaps regions that will become objects ) are forming their stars a few dynamical timescales earlier than this . notwithstanding",
    "the existence of qso j1148 + 5251 and other high redshift quasars , it seems to us that there is a need to account for massive sources at intermediate redshift which last formed stars near @xmath82 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as the apparent monotonic increase in the comoving rate of gamma - ray bursts out to @xmath101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the low - to - moderate redshift universe , we would usually take ice emission as an indication of a buried compact power source at least at ulirg luminosities , and , should blackhole growth commonly reach @xmath102 m@xmath35 by @xmath82 , as must happen at least occasionally given the existence of qso j1148 + 5251 , then our low - to - moderate redshift explanation could also apply during reionization .",
    "far infrared ice emission may be crucially important to understanding the far infrared emission of sources at high redshift and may strongly affect the range of redshifts estimated for submillimeter sources , even placing them at reionization redshifts .",
    "observations of infrared ice emission are definitive in galactic protostars and the winds of evolved stars but are scant and not fully persuasive for the local analogs of the submillimeter sources , the ulirgs .",
    "this , despite mounting evidence that ice is involved in absorbing much of the energy that is finally emitted in the far infrared in a substantial fraction of ulirgs .",
    "we find stronger indications that ice emission is important at high redshift .",
    "the data for qso j1148 + 5251 as well as the 450 @xmath0 m sources cataloged by @xcite are both strongly suggestive .",
    "we feel that further investigation along these lines could be quite fruitful .",
    "we ve considered two models where the presence of far - infrared emission features owing to ice in the sed of hdf 850.1 would place it at redshifts larger than the range estimated without ice by @xcite . in the first",
    ", the use of crystalline ice at 150 @xmath0 m as a substitute for amorphous ice is probably justified , subject to further laboratory investigations of amorphous ice . in the second ,",

    ", a lyman @xmath88 blackout would be consistent with the nir photometry for hdf 850.1 .",
    "however , we do not prefer this model and its higher redshift over the redshift range estimated by @xcite or @xmath103 from our first model .",
    "what we find to be important is that far infrared ice emission could have such a dramatic effect on the estimated redshift .",
    "it should be noted that redshifts estimated from the radio - fir relation could also turn out to be lower when ice emission is invoked since a large submillimeter - to - radio flux density ratio is easier to produce with high @xmath19 at some redshifts .",
    "so , the main conclusion of this work is that ice broadens the range of redshifts to be considered for a given submillimeter source and that ice is quite likely to be important at high redshift .",
    "* continuum observations at 3 mm of qso j1148 + 5251 may confirm ice emission in this source .",
    "* the atacama large millimeter array may be able to isolate the transition from dust to free - free / synchrotron emission for sources of this type and allow more reliable redshift estimates .",
    "* investigating the role of ice emission locally could be taken up using sofia or spitzer .",

    "<S> we are thus encouraged to apply far infrared ice emission models to the available observations of hdf 850.1 , the brightest submillimeter source in the _ hubble deep field_. we suggest that a redshift as large as 13 may need to be considered for this source , nearly a factor of three above the usual top estimate . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the possibility of far infrared ice emission in the spectral energy distributions of model sources generally broadens the range of redshifts to be considered for submillimeter sources compared to models without ice emission . </S>"
