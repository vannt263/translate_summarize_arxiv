    "the case of a non - relativistic quantum particle confined in a one dimensional box with moving walls subject to dirichlet boundary conditions has been investigated in great detail in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider more general boundary conditions and study the geometric phases that emerge .",
    "the boundary conditions we focus on are those consistent with the unitarity of the dynamics as well as with dilation symmetry .",
    "geometric phases were investigated by berry and wilkinson  @xcite who considered the behaviour of the eigenfunctions of the laplacian in a region with a triangular boundary with dirichlet boundary conditions , when the shape of the region was varied adiabatically .",
    "this study revealed the existence of `` diabolical points '' , shapes which have an accidental degeneracy in the spectrum .",
    "varying the shape of the region in a small circuit around the diabolical point led to a reversal in the sign of the eigenfunction .",
    "similar effects were also noticed earlier in molecular physics  @xcite as explained in the book by shapere and wilczek  @xcite .",
    "these sign reversals were an early example of a geometric phase . in these problems",
    "the geometric phase is essentially of topological origin .",
    "this is because of the time reversal symmetry of the problem , wave functions can be chosen real and this constrains all geometric phases to be @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in a later work by berry , the time reversal symmetry was broken by the introduction of magnetic fields and this led to the discovery of the full geometric phase  @xcite , which has been subsequently studied and generalized in many directions  @xcite and widely applied  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a particle in a box subject to general boundary conditions , which ( apart from some special cases ) violate time reversal symmetry .",
    "our hamiltonian operator is the laplacian .",
    "the location of the boundaries is adiabatically varied by translations and dilations , which gives us a two parameter space of variations .",
    "we find that there is a geometric phase and compute the two - form on the parameter space .",
    "it turns out that this two - form is similar to the area two - form on the poincar upper half - plane .    in section  [ boundcond ]",
    "we describe the most general boundary conditions that make the laplacian self - adjoint and we focus on a subset of these which are invariant under dilations . in section  [ sec : movfix ] we show how one can reduce the problem of moving walls into a fixed domain . in section  [ sec : berry ] , we compute the geometric phase two - form , which measures the extent of anholonomy in a closed circuit .",
    "this calculation involves some subtleties which require a renormalization scheme .",
    "section  [ sec : berry ] gives an alternative perspective on the renormalization .",
    "section  [ sec : degen ] deals with the two special cases in which the boundary conditions do not break time reversal symmetry and section  [ sec : conclusion ] is a concluding discussion .",
    "in this section we use the powerful technique of _ boundary triples _",
    "@xcite ( see  [ appendix ] ) to classify the self - adjoint extensions of the laplacian on an interval .",
    "we are going to use this approach in order to find all possible boundary conditions which preserve unitarity and are invariant under dilation .",
    "let us consider a quantum spinless particle of mass @xmath2 confined in a one dimensional box @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian , describing the kinetic energy of the particle , is ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the space of test functions , i.e.  the infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in @xmath7 .",
    "the adjoint operator , @xmath8 , has the same functional form of the operator  ( [ eq : ham ] ) but acts on a larger space , namely @xmath9 , the space of square integrable functions on @xmath10 $ ] whose first and second ( distribution ) derivatives are square integrable .",
    "this hamiltonian operator is symmetric but certainly not self - adjoint , @xmath11 , and thus it can not be associated to an observable of the physical system .",
    "the hamiltonian s deficiency indices , determined by the equation @xmath12 are equal to 2 , so that , by von neumann s theorem ( see for example @xcite ) , the self - adjoint extensions of the operator  ( [ eq : ham ] ) are in a one - to - one correspondence with the unitary operators on @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , this is a non - constructive theorem and one needs to find other ways of working with self - adjoint extensions . with this end in view , we define the following maps from @xmath14 to the space of boundary data @xmath13 ( see  [ appendix ] ) :",
    "@xmath15 these are well defined since @xmath16 , and the following identity holds @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the boundary form defined in  ( [ eq : boundf ] ) , which measures the `` lack of self - adjointness '' of the operator @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the canonical scalar product of @xmath21 , while @xmath22 denotes the scalar product of @xmath23 .",
    "given these maps , we have by  ( [ eq : bt ] ) that @xmath24 is a boundary triple ( see  [ appendix ] ) for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , and all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath19 are given by  ( [ eq : exts ] ) , which reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a unitary 2 @xmath27 2 matrix .",
    "this is the result obtained in  @xcite , which expresses all possible self - adjoint extensions of the laplacian in terms of unitaries on the hilbert space of boundary data @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of particular unitary matrices gives rise to some well - known boundary conditions , for example : @xmath28 @xmath29 being the first pauli matrix .",
    "now we would like to extract and parametrize a particular subset of boundary conditions which are invariant under dilations and will be useful in the following .",
    "the set we are looking for is made up by all those boundary conditions which do not mix functions with derivatives at the boundary , that is of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to show that the conditions that have to be satisfied by the former four parameters in order to represent a self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian on the interval @xmath10 $ ] are @xmath32 if we set @xmath33 , the desired boundary conditions read @xmath34 and the unitary matrix in  ( [ eq : bc ] ) associated to this self - adjoint extension is provided by @xmath35 some comments are in order . if @xmath36 we obtain periodic  ( [ eq : periodic ] ) and antiperiodic  ( [ eq : antiperiodic ] ) boundary conditions , while for @xmath37 or @xmath38 mixed dirichlet and neumann conditions arise .",
    "however , pure dirichlet or neumann conditions can not be reached by our parametrization .",
    "thus , the family in  ( [ eq : non ] ) , which we denote by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , does not exhaust the whole set of dilation - invariant boundary conditions , which is instead provided by @xmath41 moreover , it is worth noticing that the set @xmath42 does not form a subgroup of @xmath43 .    from a physical perspective",
    "the boundary conditions in  ( [ eq : mybc ] ) are nonlocal , since they connect the value of the wave function at one end of the interval with its value at the other end .",
    "a physical realization of them require that the interval be bended into a ring with the two ends forming a tunneling junction through which the wave function can acquire a phase given by  ( [ eq : non ] ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : bendingfn ] . this can be experimentally implemented by means e.g.  of superconducting quantum interference devices , where the properties of the josephson junction are suitably chosen to give the required phase  @xcite .",
    "we start by generalizing the problem of a particle of mass @xmath2 in a one dimensional box with moving walls subject to dirichlet boundary conditions ( extensively discussed in @xcite ) to a larger class of boundary conditions , which we picked out in  ( [ eq : family ] ) . for convenience we parametrize the one dimensional box by @xmath44,\\ ] ]",
    "so that @xmath45 is the center of the interval , and @xmath46 is its length , and consider the hamiltonian ( kinetic energy ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a fixed complex number representing particular boundary conditions  ( [ eq : mybc ] ) , and @xmath49 is the sobolev space of square integrable functions on @xmath50 , whose first and second derivatives are square integrable functions .",
    "some comments are necessary . in the previous section we proved that the above boundary conditions yield a good self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian on an interval .",
    "as already remarked these do not mix the values of the functions at the border with their derivatives . in what follows",
    "we will see that these are the only ones which are invariant under dilations , a crucial property for what we are going to investigate .",
    "next we take into account the dynamics of this problem by taking smooth paths in the parameter space @xmath51 : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "clearly we are translating the box by @xmath54 and contracting / dilating it by @xmath55 .",
    "as underlined in  @xcite determining the quantum dynamics of this system is not an easy problem to tackle with , since we have hilbert spaces , @xmath56 , varying with time and we need to compare vectors in different spaces .",
    "the standard approach is to embed the time - dependent spaces into a larger one , namely @xmath57 , extend the two - parameter family of hamiltonians  ( [ eq : myham ] ) to this space and try to unitarily map the problem we started with into another one , with a family of time - dependent hamiltonians on a fixed common domain .",
    "with this end in view we embed @xmath58 into @xmath57 in the following way @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the complement of the set @xmath61 , so that we can consider the extension of the hamiltonians defined in  ( [ eq : myham ] ) as @xmath62 where the embedding and the direct sum obviously depend on @xmath63 and @xmath64 . following  @xmath65 we recall how to reduce this moving walls problem into a fixed domain one .",
    "the composition of a translation @xmath66 and of a subsequent dilation @xmath67 maps the interval @xmath50 onto @xmath68,\\ ] ] which does not depend on @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "next we need to define a unitary action of both groups on @xmath57 .",
    "a possible choice is @xmath69 and both @xmath70 and @xmath71 form one - parameter ( strongly continuous ) unitary groups .",
    "the factor @xmath72 is consistent with the physical expectation that @xmath73 transforms as the square root of a density under dilation .    in order to make the expression @xmath74 meaningful , from now on",
    "we are going to identify @xmath63 with a pure number given by the ratio of the actual length of the box and a unitary length .",
    "the infinitesimal generator of the group of translations is the momentum operator @xmath75 so that spatial translations are implemented by the unitary group @xmath76 similarly , the generator of the dilation unitary group is given by the virial operator over its maximal domain : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the closure of the operator @xmath79 .",
    "dilations on @xmath57 are , thus , implemented by @xmath80 next we define the two - parameter family of unitary operators on @xmath57 , which are going to fix our time - dependent problem @xmath81 by this unitary isomorphism we are mapping @xmath82 into @xmath83 where we have used the identity @xmath84 the operators in  ( [ eq : mynewham ] ) act on the time - independent domain @xmath85 where @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 we have thus achieved our goal , that is mapping the initial family of hamiltonians with time - dependent domains into a family with a common fixed domain of self - adjointness .",
    "this has been possible thanks to the unitary operator  ( [ eq : diltr ] ) and , most importantly , to the choice of dilation - invariant boundary conditions  ( [ eq : myham ] ) as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we have taken into account those boundary conditions  ( [ eq : mybc ] ) which do not mix derivatives and functions at the boundary : these are the only ones which leave the transformed domain @xmath86 in  ( [ eq : dom ] ) time - independent .",
    "the main objective of this section will be to exhibit a non - trivial geometric phase associated to a cyclic adiabatic evolution of the physical system described in  ( [ eq : myham ] ) .",
    "let @xmath88 be a closed path in the parameter space @xmath89 .",
    "let the @xmath90-th energy level be non degenerate ; then , in the adiabatic approximation , the berry phase associated to the cyclical adiabatic evolution is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the eigenfunction associated to the @xmath90-th eigenvalue , @xmath93 is the external differential defined over the parameter manifold @xmath94 , and @xmath95 in our case @xmath96 reads @xmath97    a technical difficulty arises from equations  ( [ eq : berry])-([eq : diff ] ) . in this section we are going to show that , for fixed @xmath48 , the eigenfunctions @xmath98 determine an orthonormal basis in @xmath57 .",
    "however , in general the derivatives in  ( [ eq : diff ] ) do not belong to @xmath57 so that the integral in  ( [ eq : integ ] ) is ill - posed and needs a prescription of calculation .",
    "no doubt that the ill - posedness of  ( [ eq : berry ] ) is due to the presence of a boundary in our system .",
    "first we need to determine the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian we started with in  ( [ eq : myham ] ) or equivalently in  ( [ eq : embham ] ) .",
    "of course this would be a difficult problem to handle , but thanks to the unitary operator in  ( [ eq : diltr ] ) we can move on to the hamiltonians with fixed domain , compute the spectral decomposition and then make our way unitarily back to the problem with time - dependent domain .",
    "therefore , we need to solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath99 where @xmath100 in  ( [ eq : dom ] ) and @xmath101 . the spectral decomposition will heavily rely on the choice of the parameter @xmath48 , which , as already stressed , represents a particular choice of boundary condition .",
    "if @xmath102 the spectrum is non - degenerate , and the normalized eigenfunctions have the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 so that the dispersion relation ( @xmath105 ) reads @xmath106    let @xmath107 be an arbitrary function belonging to @xmath108 ; @xmath107 is clearly an eigenfunction of the * 0 * operator on @xmath108 with zero eigenvalue .",
    "therefore we can extend @xmath109 to an eigenfunction of  ( [ eq : embham ] ) , @xmath110 , which can be conveniently chosen to be a test function : @xmath111 , the space of smooth functions with compact support .    ) . ]    for the sake of the reader , let us exhibit an explicit construction of @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be a smooth extension of @xmath114 to the whole real line . roughly speaking our eigenfunction",
    "can be written as the restriction of this extension , namely @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath79 [ @xmath117 if @xmath118 , and @xmath119 otherwise ] , showing why divergent contributions arise from the boundary when taking derivatives .",
    "so the idea which underlies the following discussion is to regularize the contribution of the characteristic function @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be a nonnegative monotone decreasing function which belongs to @xmath122 , moreover we require that @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "we are going to paste two contracted copies of the latter to @xmath120 , such that the final result would be as in figure  [ molly2 ] .",
    "given @xmath127 we define the regularized characteristic function of @xmath50 as follows : @xmath128 which is a test function , @xmath129 . in light of the previous discussion we choose the following functions and show that they are eigenfunctions for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : embham ] ) : @xmath130 where @xmath131 see figure  [ molly ] .",
    "even if @xmath132 , this will not alter the desired regularity property and the integrability condition of  ( [ eq : emb ] ) .",
    "clearly  ( [ eq : emb ] ) is still an eigenfunction of  ( [ eq : embham ] ) because @xmath133 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian defined in  ( [ eq : myham ] ) and @xmath134 is trivially an eigenfunction of the * 0 * operator with null eigenvalue .",
    "moreover , from the explicit expression in  ( [ eq : normchar ] ) this eigenfunction is normalized .    in this renormalization scheme , which is needed for the definiteness of  ( [ eq : diff ] ) , we are first embedding @xmath135 into @xmath136 and then regularizing the boundary contribution through the introduction of the regularizer @xmath137 .    ) . ]",
    "now it is essential to observe that @xmath138 that is the eigenfunction of a particle confined in @xmath50 . here , the convergence of the limit is pointwise and , by dominated convergence , in @xmath57 .",
    "we are now in the right position to compute  ( [ eq : integ ] ) for @xmath127 , which is well posed , and then take the limit @xmath139 .",
    "we start by considering separately both the terms in @xmath140 which , after an integration by parts , become @xmath141 by plugging the explicit expressions of the eigenfunctions we find , by dominated convergence , that for @xmath139 @xmath142 moreover , since @xmath92 has inherited from @xmath143 the right regularity properties , for any @xmath127 , one gets @xmath144",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    summing up , we finally get the expression of the berry one - form : @xmath145 which is manifestly not closed yielding a nontrivial abelian phase .",
    "notice that the one - form derived in  ( [ eq : form ] ) is purely imaginary , consistently with the general theory of berry phases  @xcite .",
    "moreover it heavily depends on the energy level through @xmath146 in  ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) and on the boundary conditions through @xmath147 .    as a simple example , we choose a rectangular path @xmath88 in the @xmath148 half - plane , as shown in figure  [ fig : path ] , and compute @xmath149 whose",
    "only non - trivial contributions are given by the vertical components of the circuit .",
    "the final result is @xmath150 which , as expected , depends on the particular path chosen . in the spirit of the physical implementation of our system in terms of a ring with a junction ( see section  [ boundcond ] ) , our cyclic adiabatic evolution could be illustrated as in figure  [ fig : circles ] .",
    "another interesting aspect provided by this problem is linked to a nontrivial berry curvature : @xmath151    the above formula brings to mind the curvature of a hyperbolic riemannian manifold .",
    "indeed , consider the _",
    "poincar half - plane _ , which by definition is the upper - half plane together with the poincar metric : @xmath152 the half - plane is a model of hyperbolic geometry and if we consider the area form on it we have @xmath153 which has the same structure as the berry curvature  ( [ eq : curv ] ) of our quantum mechanical model .",
    ".[fig : circles],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we remark that the relevant group in hyperbolic geometry is @xmath154 the group of real mbius transformations .",
    "the lie algebra of this group is the space of real @xmath155 traceless matrices which are spanned by @xmath156 and @xmath157 , where the @xmath158s are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the two generators @xmath159 and @xmath160 form a closed subalgebra .",
    "the structure of this lie subalgebra is exactly the same as ours : the commutator of the virial operator and the momentum operator is the momentum operator , namely , @xmath161=",
    "one may object to the regularization scheme introduced in the previous section for its artificiality .",
    "in fact , in order to have a well - posed problem we embedded our original problem into a larger space , @xmath162 , and needed to make sense of the differential in  ( [ eq : diff ] ) . in this section",
    "we are going to understand better what may be the problem in the definition of the derivative with respect to our parameters , and , moreover , we are going to show an alternative , intrinsic , approach to renormalization which does not make use of any embedding .",
    "let us consider the following map : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a suitable unit vector independent of @xmath148 , and @xmath165 is defined in  ( [ eq : diltr ] ) .",
    "we would like to understand better the following differential : @xmath166 fix @xmath46 and consider the restriction of  ( [ eq : unit ] ) to its second argument @xmath167 @xmath168 in  ( [ eq : vtransl ] ) form a one - parameter group , whose generator is the momentum @xmath169 defined in  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) thus , @xmath170 which is well posed if and only if @xmath171 .",
    "for this reason we can interpret @xmath172 as the distributional derivative of @xmath173 which is forced to belong to @xmath57 . in our case",
    "the extension of the eigenfunction to the real line is smooth , @xmath174 , so that the derivatives can be computed classically .",
    "clearly @xmath175 is only locally summable over the real line .",
    "since the restriction of smooth functions to open subsets is still smooth and since from a physical perspective we can have information only on what happens on the inside of the one dimensional box , @xmath50 , we give the following prescription : @xmath176 being an element of @xmath177 and locally summable .",
    "an analogous prescription works for the derivative with respect to _ l_. let us return to our problem settled in @xmath178 .",
    "this time the one - form is given by @xmath179 where the derivatives in  ( [ eq : distr ] ) are to be considered in the sense stated above , that is as locally integrable functions in @xmath180 .",
    "once more , @xmath181 due to normalization the first factor in the second member vanishes so that @xmath182 while as before we get @xmath183 and an analogous expression for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath64 holds .",
    "with this in mind we are able to get the same result  ( [ eq : form ] ) as before , by reaching the boundary from the `` inside '' , rather than from the  outside \" , so that our new prescription , though equivalent to the one discussed above , may appear more natural .",
    "this is coherent from a physical perspective since we can have information only on what happens on the inside of the one dimensional box @xmath50 .",
    "for completeness , we are going to investigate the exceptional cases @xmath36 , which , as mentioned before , correspond to degenerate spectra . for @xmath184",
    "we have that for any @xmath126 the two eigenvalues @xmath185 and @xmath186 in  ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) coalesce , and an orthonormal basis in the @xmath90-th eigenspace is given by @xmath187 for @xmath188 , we have instead that @xmath189 , and a possible choice of an orthonormal basis is @xmath190    from the general theory of geometric phases  @xcite it is well known that a degenerate spectral decomposition gives rise to a one - form connection in terms of a hermitian matrix and from a geometrical perspective this corresponds to a connection on a principal bundle , whose typical fiber is identified with a non - abelian group .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath184 , which physically corresponds to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we need to compute the following matrix one - form : @xmath191 where the coefficients of the differentials are to be considered in the distributional sense .",
    "the former equation yields the following result : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the second pauli matrix . for a non - abelian principal fiber bundle , the curvature two - form , according to the cartan structure equation ,",
    "is provided by @xmath194.\\ ] ] plugging in the explicit expression of the above one - form  ( [ eq : onef ] ) we find that @xmath195 the latter equation shows explicitly that , although every fiber is two dimensional , the overall bundle is trivial .",
    "the one - form connection in  ( [ eq : onef ] ) can be _ globally _ diagonalized making use of the basis of plane waves .",
    "indeed , if we had started from a  rotated \" basis , instead of  ( [ eq : basis ] ) : @xmath196 due to euler s identity , and computed  ( [ eq : onef ] ) in this new basis , we would have obtained a diagonal matrix . in the most general case , instead",
    ", one is able to determine only a _ local _",
    "basis where the above one - form  ( [ eq : onef ] ) is diagonal . on the other hand , in our case the bundle can be globally trivialized .",
    "we have considered the problem of a particle in a box with moving walls with a class of boundary conditions .",
    "unlike the example studied by berry and wilkinson ( two dimensional region with dirichlet boundary conditions ) , our box is one dimensional and we impose more general boundary conditions .",
    "we consider situations in which the location and the size of the box are slowly varied .",
    "our problem is complicated by the fact that different points in the parameter space correspond to different hilbert spaces . in order to deal with this",
    "we need to invoke a larger hilbert space and exercise care while varying our two parameters . within this two parameter space",
    "we conclude that there is a non - trivial geometric phase .",
    "the functional form of this phase two - form is suggestive of the area two - form in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "our boundary conditions in general violate time reversal symmetry , i.e , the complex conjugate of a wave function which satisfies the boundary condition described by @xmath48 may not satisfy the same boundary condition .",
    "in fact , the only boundary conditions that respect time reversal are those where @xmath48 is real . in this case",
    ", we would expect the geometric phase to reduce to the topological phase ( which only takes values @xmath197 ) .",
    "thus the two form describing the phase must vanish .",
    "in fact when @xmath48 is real ( but not equal to @xmath197 , which is a degenerate case ) , @xmath198 in  ( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) is zero or @xmath199 and the corresponding geometric phase two - form  ( [ eq : curv ] ) vanishes , as it should .",
    "the case of @xmath200 is exceptional since it has degeneracies in the spectrum . in this case",
    "one may expect to find a @xmath43 non - abelian geometric phase of the type discussed by wilczek and zee @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the phase is a diagonal subgroup of @xmath43 and is essentially abelian .",
    "this is easy to understand from time reversal symmetry .",
    "since translations and dilations are real operations , they commute with time reversal and so the allowed @xmath43 must also be real .",
    "this reduces @xmath43 to @xmath201 , which is abelian . by a suitable choice of basis",
    "one can render the connection diagonal as in ( 86 ) .",
    "the `` non - abelian ''",
    "@xmath43 wilczek - zee phase is in fact in an abelian subgroup .",
    "it is also worth noting that the approach to @xmath200 is a singular limit because of the degeneracy there .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the adiabatic transformations we consider act quite trivially on the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , the translations are isospectral and the dilations only cause an overall change in the scale of the energy spectrum @xmath202 . in particular , there are no level crossings and no degeneracies ( away from @xmath203 ) .",
    "this illustrates a remark made by berry in the conclusion of @xcite : although degeneracies play an important role in berry s phase , they are not a necessary condition for the existence of geometric phase factors .",
    "indeed , our example reiterates this point .",
    "the berry phases are nonzero even though one of the deformations is isospectral and the other a simple scaling .",
    "it is the twisting of the eigenvectors over the parameter space that determines the berry connection and phase , not the energy spectrum .",
    "this work was partially supported by prin 2010llkjbx on `` collective quantum phenomena : from strongly correlated systems to quantum simulators , '' and by the italian national group of mathematical physics ( gnfm - indam ) .",
    "in this appendix we briefly recall the technique of boundary triples and their main applications to the search of self - adjoint extensions of densely defined symmetric operators . for a review on the subject see @xcite .",
    "von neumann s theory of self - adjoint extensions does not provide an explicit way to construct them .",
    "the theorem , in fact , guarantees their existence once the dimensions of the deficiency subspaces are found to be equal .",
    "however , self - adjoint extensions can be constructed as restrictions of the adjoint operator over suitable domains where a sesquilinear form identically vanishes .",
    "given @xmath204 hermitian , we define the following sesquilinear form : @xmath205 the essential ingredient in the analysis of self - adjoint extensions is given by the deficiency subspaces , where the boundary form usually does not vanish .",
    "every element @xmath206 can be uniquely split into three components  @xcite @xmath207 where @xmath208 are the deficiency subspaces , that is the null spaces of @xmath209 . from this decomposition",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath210 showing how the boundary form can be used as a measure of  lack of self - adjointness \" .",
    "moreover von neumann s theorem tells us that every self - adjoint extension is in a one - to - one correspondence with a unitary operator @xmath26 between the deficiency subspaces .",
    "it follows that each self - adjoint extension of t is given by @xmath211    following @xcite we now introduce a more general tool useful for unveiling all the self - adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator .",
    "we will show how this naturally arises from von neumann s theory and extends it .",
    "moreover , von neumann s theory and the use of boundary forms are helpful when studying differential operators , but what could one state about self - adjoint extensions of hermitian operators , which are not in general differential operators ?",
