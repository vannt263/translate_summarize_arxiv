    "it is widely believed that understanding the origin of matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry in the universe holds an important clue to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a distinguishing signature of the nature of the new physics is the epoch at which baryogenesis occurs . in a series of recent papers  @xcite we have proposed and studied a new mechanism , termed post - sphaleron baryogenesis ( psb ) , where this dynamics occurs at or below the tev scale .",
    "this mechanism takes advantage of the baryon number violating decays of a new particle , either a scalar or a fermion , which couples to the sm fermions through a higher - dimensional operator ( with dimension @xmath7 ) .",
    "if these decays go out of equilibrium near the tev scale , then the epoch of baryogenesis would be below the electroweak phase transition temperature , when the sphalerons have already decoupled due to the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "the low baryogenesis scale arises if the process mediated by the higher - dimensional operator , @xmath8 , is in the observable range .",
    "this scenario is not only distinct from all other available baryogenesis mechanisms such as leptogenesis ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) or electroweak baryogenesis ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) but also involves tev scale new particles accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) when an ultraviolet complete version of this theory is presented , and leads to interesting low energy phenomena accessible to non - accelerator searches as well .    a specific realization of the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath0  @xcite with a quark - lepton unified generalization  @xcite of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite with tev seesaw scale . the effective @xmath9 operator @xmath8 in this model that couples to a tev scale scalar field @xmath10 arises from the exchange of color - sextet fields .",
    "these are part of the @xmath11 triplet higgs field responsible for @xmath12 symmetry breaking and the seesaw mechanism . in this model",
    ", the same operator @xmath8 that leads to baryogenesis also leads to the baryon number violating process of neutron ",
    "antineutron ( @xmath2 ) oscillation  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect a connection between the amount of baryon asymmetry created in the early universe and the strength of @xmath2 oscillation amplitude .",
    "a realistic model of this type must reproduce the correct neutrino mass and mixing parameters , as measured by various neutrino oscillation experiments , and also satisfy the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constraints which arise in this case due to exchange of the color - sextet scalar fields .",
    "an investigation of these issues was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that if the color - sextet fields are in the tev to sub - tev range , consistence with fcnc constraints implies that neutrino masses must arise via a type  ii seesaw mechanism and must exhibit an inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "we presented a specific realization of this idea within a version  @xcite of quark - lepton unified @xmath0 model that embeds the type ",
    "ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "we also predicted the @xmath2 oscillation to be sizable in this scenario if the model has to satisfy the constraints of generating adequate baryon asymmetry .",
    "this model may also be testable via searches for the color - sextet scalar bosons at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out that there have been other proposals for low - scale baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "our scenario differs from them not only in that we employ a model that connects the new physics to neutrino masses but it also makes a specific testable prediction for a baryon number violating process of neutron - anti - neutron oscillation ( as we show below ) as well as new tev scale particles at colliders .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism for baryogenesis in our paper differs from those in refs .",
    "@xcite in two ways : ( a ) the operator responsible for baryogenesis in our case is different ; ( b ) the one loop absorptive part that generates the primordial @xmath13 asymmetry in our model involves flavor changing effects involving the @xmath14-exchange , whereas in the above papers it involves new fields beyond the sm .",
    "while this paper is a follow - up to our earlier paper  @xcite , it presents several new results :    * we present detailed constraints on the masses and couplings of the color - sextet scalar fields from various fcnc constraints . while ref .",
    "@xcite focussed on tree level constraints , here we include the one loop box diagram effects which provide stronger constraints on different flavor combinations of the sextet couplings .",
    "* we have found a one - loop @xmath14-exchange contribution to the @xmath2 amplitude which gives an enhanced rate for @xmath2 transition rate compared to the one given in ref .",
    "a striking new result of the present paper is an absolute upper limit on the @xmath2 oscillation time @xmath5 of @xmath15 _ sec . _",
    "irrespective of the @xmath12 breaking scale , which follows from the fact that we must generate enough baryon asymmetry via this mechanism .",
    "this oscillation time is within the accessible range for the next generation of proposed searches for this process  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ review ] , we review the basic features of our model . in section  [ fcnc ] ,",
    "we summarize the fcnc constraints on the yukawa couplings in our model ; in section  [ psb ] , we discuss various constraints that need to be satisfied in order to generate the observed baryon asymmetry using the psb mechanism ; and in section  [ nnb ] , we give the model predictions for @xmath2 oscillation time and the resulting upper limit on it .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ con ] . in appendix",
    "a , we present an explicit calculation of baryon asymmetry generated by using @xmath16conserving vertices in a toy model . this example shows the consistency of our baryon asymmetry generation mechanism using @xmath14 boson loops .",
    "we start by reviewing the basic features of our model  @xcite , based on the quark - lepton unified gauge group @xmath0 with sm fermions plus the right - handed neutrino belonging to @xmath17 representations of the group in the well known left - right symmetric way  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the model consists of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the first stage of the symmetry breaking is implemented by a @xmath18 higgs field which splits the @xmath22 scale @xmath23 from the remaining ones with @xmath24 tev @xcite to satisfy the constraint from rare kaon decay : br@xmath25  @xcite . the surviving @xmath26 gauge symmetry is then broken in two stages down to the sm , i.e. by the higgs field @xmath27 to the symmetry @xmath28 which subsequently breaks down to the sm by the higgs field @xmath29 .",
    "the second stage is where the @xmath12 symmetry breaks down and the right - handed neutrinos acquire mass by the usual seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we denote this scale by @xmath30 , which is an essential parameter in our discussion below .",
    "it is also possible that the @xmath27 higgs field is absent in the spectrum , in which case the @xmath31 gauge symmetry breaks directly down to the sm symmetry via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath29 field .",
    "the sm higgs field is a linear combination of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 higgs fields .    to discuss the mechanism for baryogenesis in the model",
    ", we first note that under @xmath32 , the @xmath29 field , denoted by @xmath33 , decomposes as @xmath34 the last field in the decomposition , @xmath35 , is a neutral complex field whose real part acquires a vev @xmath30 in the ground state and can be written as @xmath36 .",
    "the field @xmath37 is absorbed by the @xmath12 gauge boson , while the real scalar @xmath10 remains as a physical higgs particle .",
    "it is the decay of this @xmath10 that will generate baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the various color - sextet sub - multiplets of the field @xmath38 have couplings of the form @xmath39 here the yukawa couplings , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) , obey the boundary conditions @xmath40 in the @xmath41 symmetry limit .",
    "all fermion fields here are right  handed , we have suppressed the chiral projection operators for simplicity",
    ". there are analogous terms , dictated by left ",
    "right symmetry , where the left ",
    "handed fermion fields couple to the higgs fields in the @xmath42 representation , with identical coupling strength as shown in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) are part of the higgs potential , and are crucial for the generation of baryon asymmetry , with the boundary condition @xmath43 .",
    "the color indices in these two terms are contracted by two @xmath44 factors .",
    "note that the @xmath10 field contained in @xmath45 is a real scalar field and therefore it can decay into both six quark and six anti - quark final states , thereby violating baryon number by two units .",
    "the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) allow for such baryon number violating decays of @xmath10 .",
    "if the right thermodynamic conditions are satisfied , it can generate baryon asymmetry in the presence of @xmath13 violation . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ckm @xmath13 violation is enough in this case although the presence of @xmath13 violation in the @xmath46 couplings can help to enhance this .",
    "the same interactions also generate a @xmath9 operator , once the vev of @xmath10 is inserted , that leads to neutron  antineutron oscillations . in this paper , we argue that the right thermodynamic conditions are so restrictive that they imply @xmath47 _ sec . _ for arbitrary @xmath30 , and for low - scale @xmath30 around",
    "200 tev , even more restrictive : @xmath48 _ sec .",
    "_ which is accessible to the next generation @xmath2 oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "the significance of this result is that if in future experiments , the lower limit on @xmath5 is found to exceed this limit , this model for psb and neutrino masses will be ruled out .",
    "[ fcnc ] it was noted in ref . @xcite that tree - level exchange of color - sextet fields would result in new contributions to @xmath49 meson  antimeson mixing , thereby yielding severe constraints on the masses and couplings of the color - sextet fields .",
    "subsequently we have realized that there are also important box diagrams which provide further constraints coming both from @xmath49 meson  antimeson mixing as well as flavor changing non - leptonic decays of @xmath50 and @xmath16 mesons . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall present details of this analysis @xcite . here",

    "[ fig - tree ] illustrates new contributions to @xmath51 mixing mediated by the @xmath52 color - sextet scalar field .",
