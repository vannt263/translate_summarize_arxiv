    "the solar corona consists of very hot , tenuous plasma , and the processes responsible for its multi - million kelvin temperature still remains unexplained .",
    "the three parameters peak radiance , doppler shift and line width , obtained from the line profiles of coronal emission lines , provide vital information to understand the physical and dynamical properties of the source .",
    "line profiles carry both thermal and non - thermal information of the source .    studied the line profiles of some euv lines using a rocket experiment and observed an increased broadening with height above the limb .",
    "coronal hole fe  x  spectra taken at the national solar observatory showed an increase in the line width with height @xcite .",
    "soho / sumer @xcite was used to record the off - limb , height - resolved spectra of a si  viii density - sensitive line pair , in equatorial coronal regions @xcite and in polar coronal holes which indicate an increase in non - thermal velocity with height .",
    "a similar analysis by , in several other spectral lines , also showed an increase in doppler width with height . using the eis spectrometer on _ hinode _ , reported that for the polar region , the line width data show that the non - thermal line - of - sight velocity increases from 26  km  s@xmath0  at 10@xmath1  above the limb to 42  km  s@xmath0  at some 150@xmath1  ( _ i.e. _ @xmath2110  000  km ) above the limb .",
    "the measured variation in line width with height supports undamped wave propagation in coronal structures .",
    "this was a strong evidence of outwardly propagating , undamped alfvn waves in the corona , which may contribute to coronal heating and the high - speed solar wind in the case of coronal holes .",
    ", based on sumer observations , suggested that the increase in line width could be due to an increase in ion temperature which significantly deviates from ionization equilibrium temperature , due to preferential heating .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) using extensive data obtained with the 25-cm norikura coronagraph , found that the fwhm of [ fe  x ]  6374    ( red emission line ) increases with height whereas that of the [ fe  xiv ]  5303    ( green emission line ) decreases with height in the same region .",
    "they suggested that this behaviour can be explained by gradual mixing of different temperature plasma with height above the limb . by including the ir lines [ fe  xiii ]  10747    and 10798    in their study , found that the fwhm of spectral lines with ionization temperatures less than 1.6  mk increase and more than 1.6  mk decrease with height . observed similar complex variations in radiance ratios of different lines , with respect to red line",
    "the green line to red line radiance ratio decreases with height above the limb , whereas the ir to red and [ fe  xi ]  7892    to red ratios increase with height .",
    "they proposed that such a behaviour in the radiance ratios of emission lines can also be explained if we consider the gradual interaction between relatively cold and hot plasma .",
    "as a further confirmation , found that the fwhm of the red and green lines does not vary after heights greater than @xmath2250@xmath1  above the limb .",
    "this is expected in the case of gradual mixing of multi - thermal plasma with increasing altitude , as the plasma reaches a uniform temperature and non - thermal velocity after a certain height .",
    "recently , reported an increase in the line width of the green line with height , up to about 400@xmath1  above the limb , from the line profiles obtained during the total solar eclipse of 21 june 2001 using a fabry@xmath3perot [ fp ] etalon . also observed a case where the green - line width increases with height and showed that the fwhm of emission lines is different for different coronal features",
    "by analysing over 130 coronal structures observed that 89  % of the structures show a negative gradient in the green emission line and 95  % of those show a positive gradient in the red emission line .",
    "it may be just a coincidence that different structures with different physical and dynamical characteristics showed such a result reported by . also , the results by singh",
    "_  are based on a large data base spread over many years whereas those of @xcite are based on observations during an eclipse of short duration .",
    "it may also be noted that the instrumental line width in their case is 0.2    and the uncertainty in the line width determination is 0.03    compared to the values @xmath4 0.1    and 0.002   respectively , in the spectroscopic measurements made by .",
    "in addition , the observed line profiles of emission with fp are asymmetric as compared to those with the spectrograph , because of the varying dispersion in fp interference fringes .",
    "all of the previous studies by @xcite , are mostly for equatorial regions . here",
    ", we made an attempt to understand the behaviour of those lines in polar ( high - latitude ) regions , using the spectroscopic observations with the same 25-cm norikura coronagraph . in the following sections , we give the details of our observations ,",
    "discuss the data analysis steps , and finally the results obtained and their implications .",
    "raster scans of the off - limb solar corona were taken using the 25-cm coronagraph at norikura , japan , on several days in september and october , 2004 .",
    "most of the scans were taken simultaneously in two iron emission lines using two ccd cameras , with one line being [ fe  x ]  6374    ( red line ) and the other being [ fe  xi ]  7892    or [ fe  xiii ]  10747    or [ fe  xiv ]  5303    ( green line ) .",
    "a few scans were taken in the green line alone when the second camera did not work .",
    "the length of the slit is around 500@xmath1  and the width is 4@xmath1  for most of the scans and 5@xmath1  for the rest .",
    "details on the instrumental setup can be found in @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "each scan covers around 100@xmath1  of the solar corona above the limb .",
    "the exposure times were varied from scan to scan and day to day , over a broad range from 50 to 180  seconds for each spectrum , according to the target of observation to get a good signal .",
    "the dark , flat , and disk spectra were taken immediately after each set of observations .",
    "although the main target was to scan the polar corona , due to some miscalculation during the setup , the centre of the slit was kept around 65@xmath5 solar latitude which means our scans cover the region roughly from 46@xmath5 to 84@xmath5 solar latitude .",
    "this allowed us to study the line - width behaviour in the mid- and the high - latitude regions separately and compare them with the earlier equatorial region results .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we find a systematic change in fwhm values from equatorial to mid - latitude to high - latitude regions and it is different for different lines . to compare different lines , we plot the average fwhm values for all of the observed emission lines at the equatorial , mid - latitude , and polar regions for heights 10@xmath1  and 60@xmath1  above the limb in figure  [ latvar ] . vertical bars over the mean values denote the dispersion of fwhm ( one-@xmath6 values ) at these regions and",
    "the overplotted solid line is the linear fit to these values .",
    "it may be noted that these values do not represent a particular latitude but represent average latitudes of about 20@xmath5 , 55@xmath5 , and 75@xmath5 .",
    "so they are not plotted to scale in x - axis .",
    "this can alter the fit coefficients significantly , but does not affect the comparison much .",
    "both of the panels in this figure , for 10@xmath1  and 60@xmath1  heights , indicate significant increase in mean fwhm from equatorial to polar regions , in all of the lines except for the green line , which shows very marginal changes .",
    "the quantitative changes for each line in these plots are given in table  [ latchange ] .",
    "spectral line width , in the middle and high - latitude corona , is observed to vary with altitude differently in the four emission lines studied .",
    "it can be clearly seen from figure  [ fwhmfull ] and tables  [ comb_tbl ] and [ div_tbl ] that the fwhm of the red line shows a positive gradient and that of the green line shows a negative gradient with height up to 100@xmath1  distance off - limb .",
    "this implies that the red - line width increases with height and that of the green line decreases with height which is consistent with the earlier results for equatorial regions @xcite . despite the small number of scans in the other two emission lines , [ fe  xi ] and [ fe  xiii ] , the trend of variation in fwhm with height in these lines , in polar regions , is similar to that observed in equatorial regions . the ir line at 10747   shows mixed behaviour in gradient as seen in the table for mid - latitude , which is consistent with the earlier results .",
    "so this complex variation in line widths of different emission lines seems to be global and general , _",
    "i.e. _ not restricted to any particular region or to the coronal conditions on any particular day .",
    "several space - based observations indicate different variations in the off - limb line widths . examined the mg  x 625   line in the equatorial quiet region using the cds instrument on soho and observed narrowing of the emission line as a function of altitude above 50  000  km .",
    "they attributed this narrowing to the dissipation of alfvn waves in the close field loops .",
    "however , the joint observations from cds and sumer by indicate a slight plateau rather than a decrease in the line width . similar analysis by in the north polar coronal hole , extending from the disk part of the coronal hole to @xmath290  000  km above the limb suggest a turnover point , around 65  000  km above the limb , where the line widths seem to suddenly decrease or level - off .",
    "they further pointed out that this change in behaviour occurs at approximately the same line width value in each of the data sets examined , suggesting a key value for non - thermal velocity .",
    "studied the height variation of both line width and line ratio of mg  x 609.78 and 624.94   line pair in an off - limb north polar region .",
    "they observed that the line widths , after an initial increase , start to decrease at a height ( @xmath21150@xmath1 ) where the dominant excitation changes from collisional to radiative as derived from the line ratio .",
    "based on this , it is suggested that the reduction in the non - thermal velocity , and thereby line width , is somehow linked to the excitation mechanism , probably through changes in electron density .",
    "show that alfvn waves propagating along a magnetic flux tube go through refraction and get damped via viscous dissipation and resistivity under linear incompressible mhd approximation .",
    "they see a peak in the energy flux density at about 1.15  r@xmath7 after which it declines supporting the observational evidences of damping of upwardly propagating waves . , using lasco - c1 data , found a gradual increase of line width of the red line , and an initial increase followed by a decrease in the case of green line .",
    "they suggested that ion@xmath3cyclotron heating or propagating alfvn waves can explain the gradual increase and the resonant absorption of alfvn waves might explain the decrease of line width after an increase .",
    "more recent observations using _",
    "hinode_/eis , reveal a gradual decrease in line width after an initial increase in polar coronal holes which is attributed to alfvn wave damping @xcite .",
    "all of these explanations definitely have their implications in coronal heating and solar - wind acceleration but can not explain the line width increase with height in one line and decrease in the other , of a co - spatially and simultaneously observed pair .    and explained this complex behaviour of line widths in terms of gradual mixing of different temperature plasma with increasing height .",
    "although , this explanation seems to fit the observations very well , this model requires the interaction between different temperature plasma , magnetically isolated near the foot points and gradually mixed with increase of altitude .",
    "this may not be easy in a low-@xmath8 environment such as the solar corona , more particularly in polar regions",
    ". may be the different temperature plasma regions in a loop are not magnetically isolated , instead they are physically connected through thermal conduction , as suggested by .",
    "it is possible that individual loop structures that are observed have many strands at sub - pixel resolution .",
    "if we assume that these strands are fed by small - scale impulsive events such as nano flares and have shorter life span compared to the broader loop structure , then the disappearing strands with different temperature plasma may allow interaction between them .    now coming to the latitudinal changes , fwhm values are considerably higher in the polar region as compared to the equatorial region , for all of the lines except the green line .",
    "this behaviour of the green line is surprising .",
    "if we ignore the temperature difference between these two regions , the higher fwhm implies higher non - thermal velocities in the polar regions .",
    "these results suggest the existence of a non - thermal source , waves or turbulence , that provides additional energy to power the solar - wind acceleration and may indicate that the acceleration of the solar wind takes place at the base of the solar corona itself .",
    "but the reason for the lack of change in fwhm of the green emission line remains to be explored .    analyzed the spectra in the green line at several off - limb locations both in equatorial and polar corona up to 12@xmath9 heights above the limb .",
    "they did not find any decrease in the green - line width with height , and they observed higher values of line width in the polar regions .",
    "our current findings do not seem to agree with their results although a direct comparison is difficult due to the observations at different coronal heights .",
    "however , our findings assume importance because of the better spectral and spatial resolutions , closely spaced observations , and the large data base generated from observations made on a number of days .",
    "from our observations that cover both the mid- and high - latitude regions , we studied the dependence of fwhm on height .",
    "we compared our results with the previous results from equatorial regions obtained with the same coronagraph .",
    "we also investigated the latitudinal dependence combining the results from these three regions .",
    "we find that the fwhm of the red line shows positive gradients and that of the green line shows negative gradients with height .",
    "the gradient in the ir line is negative for some structures and positive for others .",
    "all of these results are consistent with those from equatorial regions and might indicate that this behaviour is global irrespective of the location ( equatorial / polar ) .",
    "we also find that the fwhm values are higher in polar regions as compared to equatorial regions with a gradual increase towards the poles in all of the lines except in the green line which does not show any change .",
    "we infer that the higher fwhm values in polar regions indicate higher non - thermal velocities which might be related to some process responsible for accelerating the solar wind , but the behaviour of green line , which shows almost no change , has to be addressed .",
    "the authors thank the referee for useful comments .",
    "j.  singh thanks the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) for providing the financial grant to make a trip to norikura observatory to make the observations .",
    "he also thanks the team at the observatory for their help during observations ."
