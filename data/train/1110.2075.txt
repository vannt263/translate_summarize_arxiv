    "study of the probability distribution of wealth of the people in a society goes back to 1897 when pareto observed empirically that the distribution is characterized by a power law tail .",
    "probability that an individual member has wealth more than @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this type of distribution is known as the pareto distribution @xcite .",
    "this observation reflects the inherent inequality in the economic structure of the society .",
    "a large number of individuals are economically poor . in comparison",
    "the number of wealthier people is less and their number gradually decreases as their wealth increases .",
    "the cut - off of the distribution corresponds to with few very rich individuals .",
    "consequently a sizable fraction of the society s net wealth is infact possessed by a class of top rich people consisting only a few percent of society s entire population . since measuring wealth is difficult , in recent years distributions of income and tax return amounts have been studied in different countries .",
    "for example tax return amount distribution in us and japan shows a log - normal distribution in the middle range followed by a power law for high income people @xcite , uk data of income shows an exponential decay which is followed by a power law in the high income range @xcite and income data in brazil for 2004 shows an almost gaussian law for the low and middle income groups where as high salary groups are described approximately by power law @xcite .",
    "a good amount of research effort has been devoted in recent times to study the wealth distribution using the ideas of statistical physics . in this description",
    "an individual member is called an agent .",
    "the microstate specified by the precise description of wealth of every agent changes after each transaction . their wealth change due to interaction among themselves .",
    "this interaction is the mutual bipartite trade among different pairs of agents .",
    "thus the wealth distribution evolves due to such repeated interactions and finally assumes a time independent form .    in a simple model",
    "the total wealth of the entire society has been considered as strictly conserved . in a transaction",
    "the net amount of wealth of the pair of agents is randomly re - shuffled between them and therefore the pairwise interactions also maintain conservation of wealth @xcite .",
    "starting from an arbitrary initial distribution of wealth with a fixed average value the system attains a steady state .",
    "the steady state wealth distribution has been found to have an exponentially decaying tail .",
    "such distribution was also observed in @xcite . in a subsequent modification of",
    "the model saving propensity factor @xmath3 has been introduced where each trader invests only @xmath4 fraction of his wealth to the bipartite trade @xcite . with a fixed value of @xmath3",
    "the steady state wealth distribution becomes very similar to the gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "this model was further extended by assigning quenched saving propensities @xmath5 specific to each individual agent @xcite .",
    "here one gets a power law tail with @xmath6 only when wealth distributions are averaged over different @xmath7 sets @xcite .",
    "all these results exhibit economic inequality in the society .",
    "a review of all these models has been published in @xcite .",
    "apart from these a different idea of extremal dynamics for the evolution of wealth distribution has been studied by pianegonda et .",
    "al . on an one dimensional ( @xmath8 ) lattice @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that always the poorest agent of the society initiates a trade since he feels the strongest urge to raise its economic status . the trade is implemented by locating the poorest agent and refreshing his wealth randomly . to ensure that the model remains strictly conserved , the amount of wealth gained by the minimal site has been taken out equally from its two neighbors .",
    "consequently this model allows an agent to possess a negative wealth . in the stationary state of large systems @xmath9 jumps from zero to a maximal value at a critical value of @xmath10 and",
    "then it decays as @xmath0 increases as the boltzmann - gibbs exponential function .",
    "the pianegonda model is very similar to the non - conservative self - organized extremal model for the ecological evolution of interacting species introduced by bak and sneppen ( bs ) @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of self - organized criticality ( soc ) is the spontaneous emergence of fluctuations of all length and time scales in a slowly driven system .",
    "this concept was first introduced to describe the formation of a sandpile of a fixed shape @xcite .",
    "later the idea of soc has been applied to a large number of different physical systems @xcite . in a stochastic version of the sandpile model grains",
    "are distributed to randomly selected neighboring sites @xcite . in the soc models fluctuations",
    "are described in terms of avalanches of activities and their size distributions assume power law decaying functions for large system sizes . in bs model an entire species is represented by a single fitness variable . a set of species is represented by the nodes of a graph . using the spirit of darwinian principle in each mutation the fitness of the node with globally minimal value",
    "is searched and is refreshed by a new random value .",
    "effect of this propagates to few neighboring nodes which are also refreshed .",
    "the system eventually reaches a stationary state when the fitness distribution assumes a time independent step like form .",
    "an absorbing state phase transition in presence of a conserved continuous local field has been studied recently @xcite . in this model",
    "a pair of sites is said to be active if at least one of them has energy more than a pre - assigned threshold .",
    "an active pair re - shuffles its net energy between them keeping the energy strictly conserved . beyond a critical value of the threshold",
    "the number of active pairs fluctuates with time in the stationary state and the time averaged density of active pairs has been considered as the order parameter for the problem . as the threshold value is tuned a continuous phase transition is observed from an absorbing phase to an active phase @xcite .",
    "it was claimed that the critical exponents of this model are different from the directed percolation model .    in a related model defined for the wealth distribution at least one of the agents in a bipartite trading",
    "is selected from a subset of agents @xcite .",
    "this subset is formed by agents who have wealth less than certain upper cutoff , the other agent being selected randomly from the neighbors of the first agent . in a transaction",
    "the net wealth of the pair of agents is randomly re - shuffled between them .",
    "the order parameter has been defined as the fraction of agents having wealth below a certain threshold value and it is claimed that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at a critical value of the threshold wealth .",
    "a number of critical exponents have been measured to characterize the transition and some of them are found to be close to corresponding exponents in the manna model of self - organized critically @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed numerical analysis of the modified pianegonda et .",
    "al . model whose trading rule has been replaced by the stochastic re - shuffling of the net wealth of a pair of agents .",
    "we consider this model as one of the few examples of non - dissipative soc systems where the entire wealth of the society is strictly conserved , for example the fixed energy sandpile @xcite .",
    "estimation of a number of critical exponents of the modified pianegonda et .",
    "model suggests that this model does not belong to the universality class of either bs model or manna model .",
    "we believe that it belongs to a new universality class perhaps because of strict conservation of wealth is maintained in its dynamical rules . the model studied by us in this paper and that in @xcite are essentially same but studied from two different approaches .",
    "an approach which is very typical of a soc system has been followed by us where the critical poverty line spontaneously evolves without any fine tuning .",
