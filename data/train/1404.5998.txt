    "the solar wind is a constant presence throughout the heliosphere , affecting cometary tails , planetary atmospheres , and the interface with the interstellar medium .",
    "identifying the acceleration mechanism(s ) that power the wind remains one of the key unsolved mysteries in the field .",
    "theorists have proposed a variety of physical processes that may be responsible , and these processes are invoked in models that seek to explain both the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "such models are often categorized by their primary use of either magnetic reconnection and the opening of closed magnetic loops ( reconnection / loop - opening models , rlo ) or the generation of magnetoacoustic and alfvn waves and the turbulence created by them ( wave / turbulence - driven models , wtd ) .",
    "several reviews have discussed the many suggested models and the associated controversies @xcite . + rlo models require closed field lines , where both footpoints of magnetic flux tubes are anchored to the photosphere . interactions between neighboring closed loops or between closed and open field lines lead to magnetic reconnection , which releases stored magnetic energy when the magnetic topology is reconfigured .",
    "reconnection in closed field regions has been suggested to play a role in streamers @xcite and in the quiet sun on supergranular scales @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite provided evidence that the complex and continuous evolution of this so - called `` magnetic carpet '' @xcite of open and closed field lines may not provide enough energy to accelerate the outflow to match in situ measurements of wind speed .",
    "+ alternatively , wtd models are useful for explaining heating and wind acceleration in regions of the sun where the flux tubes are primarily open , that is , they are rooted to the photosphere by only one footpoint and reconnection is less likely to release significant amounts of energy . in this case ,",
    "alfvn waves and magnetoacoustic oscillations can be launched at the footpoints when the flux tube is jostled by convection at the photosphere . as the density of the solar atmosphere drops with height ,",
    "the waves are partially reflected ; counter - propagating waves interact and generate magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "this turbulence generates energy at large scales , and the break - up of eddies causes an energy cascade down to smaller scales where the energy can be dissipated as heat at a range of heights .",
    "wtd models have naturally produced solar winds with properties that match observed outflows in the corona and further out in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "this paradigm for solar wind acceleration has , however , also been challenged @xcite , so perhaps the answer to the entire question of coronal heating is more complex than previously thought .",
    "+ one of the most striking aspects of the observations of the solar wind is the appearance of a bimodal distribution of speeds at 1 au .",
    "the existence of separate components of the outflow has been observed since _ mariner 2 _ began collecting data in interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "the fast wind has asymptotic wind speeds above roughly 600 km s@xmath0 and is characterized by low densities , low variability , and photospheric abundances .",
    "the slow wind , however , has speeds at 1 au at or below 450 km s@xmath0 and is chaotic , with high densities and enhanced abundances of low - fip elements @xcite .",
    "it has been widely accepted that fast wind streams originate from coronal holes , which are characterized by unipolarity , open magnetic field , and lower densities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the location of slow wind is more of a mystery .",
    "slow solar wind has often been attributed to sources in the streamer belt @xcite , but recent progress suggests that perhaps pseudostreamers or the edges of coronal holes may significantly contribute to this slower population @xcite . however , a variety of acceleration mechanisms have been proposed along with these suggested slow wind sources . in this paper , we investigate many of these sources and coronal structures using a single theoretical framework , allowing us to determine if the different populations of solar wind can be explained by simply a difference in their region of origin . +",
    "current observations have not been able to distinguish between the many competing theoretical models , as many models have a variety of free parameters that can be adjusted to fit observations without specifying all of the physics . to compare the validity of these models at different points in the solar cycle and for different magnetic field structures on the sun ,",
    "the community needs flexible tools that predict wind properties using a limited number of input parameters that are all based on observations and fundamental physics .",
    "in this project , we study the extent of magnetic field structures that can produce solar wind that matches observations using two wtd models . in section 2 , we set up a grid of flux tube models as a parameter study of a broad range of open magnetic structures throughout the solar cycle .",
    "we present in section 3 the analysis of this grid of models using zephyr @xcite .",
    "we introduce the new code tempest in section 4 and discuss its use as a forecasting tool . in section 5",
    "we compare the results of zephyr and tempest and discuss differences in the models .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss these results and their importance in solving the coronal heating problem .",
    "for several decades , the solar physics community has relied heavily on a single measure of the magnetic field geometry to forecast the solar wind properties at 1 au , the so - called _ expansion factor_. @xcite defined the expansion factor relative to the source surface radius @xcite as : @xmath1\\ ] ] in equation , the subscript `` base '' signifies the radius of the photospheric footpoint of a given flux tube and `` ss '' refers to the source surface , typically set to @xmath2 = 2.5 r@xmath3 .",
    "potential field source surface ( pfss ) modeling assumes that @xmath4 , the source surface is a surface of zero potential , and field lines that reach this height are forced to be radial and defined as `` open '' to the heliosphere . using the expansion factor of equation , @xcite determined an empirical relationship between @xmath5 and the radial outflow at 1 au ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they binned observed expansion factors and gave typical outflow speeds at 1 au for each bin .",
    "they found that , for @xmath7 , @xmath8 km s@xmath0 and for @xmath9 , @xmath10 km s@xmath0 . the key point from this simple model is that the fastest wind comes from flux tubes with the lowest expansion factors and vice versa .",
    "+ the wang - sheeley empirical relation was used throughout the field for a decade before it was modified by @xcite .",
    "they used a two - step process to make four - day advanced predictions , first defining the relation between expansion factor and wind speed _ at the source surface _ and then propagating that boundary condition of the solar wind to the radius of the earth s orbit , including the effects of stream interactions .",
    "the initial step relies on a similar empirical fit to assign a velocity at the source surface based on the expansion factor in equation , and is set by the following expression : @xmath11 because this combined wang - sheeley - arge ( wsa ) model is often the exclusive method used for forecasting the solar wind , it is important for us to consider the efficacy of this method correctly matching observations .",
    "early comparisons of the wsa model and observations gave correlation coefficients often at or below 0.5 for a given subset of the observations , and over the full three - year period they considered , the best method used had an overall correlation coefficient of 0.39 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that comparing the wind speed and expansion factor led to a correlation coefficient of 0.56 .",
    "expansion on wsa with semi - empirical modeling predicted solar maximum properties well , but produced up to 100 km s@xmath0 differences in comparison to observations during solar minimum @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the community could benefit from a better prediction scheme than this simple reliance on the expansion factor .",
    "more recently , the wsa model has been used in conjunction with an ideal mhd simulation code called enlil ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . even with the more sophisticated mhd code , it is still very difficult to make accurate predictions of the wind speed based on only a single measure of the magnetic field geometry at the sun , @xmath5 .",
    "prediction errors are often attributed to the fact that these models do not account for time evolution of the synoptic magnetic field , but we also believe that the limitations of the simple wsa correlation may be to blame as well . + there is a specific structure type observed on the sun for which the wsa model is consistently inaccurate . at solar minimum , the sun s magnetic field is close to a dipole , with large polar coronal holes ( pch ) where the field is open to the greater heliosphere and a belt of helmet streamers where the northern and southern hemispheres have opposite polarity radial magnetic field strength .",
    "however , if an equatorial coronal hole ( ech ) is present with the same polarity of the pch of that hemisphere , there is an additional structure that has a shape similar to a helmet streamer but has the same polarity on either side of it that fills the corona between the ech and pch",
    ". early work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) refers to these structures as `` streamer belts without a neutral line , '' and this is the most important distinction as these structures contain no large current sheets , whereas helmet streamers nearly always are a part of the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) . @xcite coined the term `` pseudostreamers '' and discuss observations of the solar wind emanating from such structures .",
    "they found that the @xmath12 relationship vastly overestimates the wind speed from pseudostreamers because these structures are characterized by squashed expansion but produce slow wind ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "further work by @xcite found that comparisons using the parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean photospheric magnetic field strength of the flux tube , yielded a more accurate prediction of the wind speed . comparing this parameter to our definition of @xmath5 in equation",
    "suggests that only the magnetic field at the source surface is needed to describe the relationship between magnetic field geometry and solar wind properties .",
    "@xcite provides a theoretical interpretation for why this parameter ( @xmath13 ) works well to describe solar wind accelerated by alfvn waves .",
    "+ in order to investigate the full range of open magnetic fields that exist throughout the solar cycle , we examine pfss extrapolations from full carrington rotation ( cr ) magnetograms taken by wilcox solar observatory @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : wso_pfss ] shows two representative data sets from solar cycle 23 .",
    "what is most important to note is that the flux tubes extrapolated from observations do not always decrease monotonically .",
    "two flux tubes with identical values of @xmath5 may look significantly different at heights between the photosphere and source surface .",
    "these differences at middle heights could have a significant impact on the properties of the resulting solar wind .",

    "@xcite introduced the mhd one - fluid code zephyr and showed that zephyr can accurately match observations of the solar wind . in that paper , the authors based their magnetic field geometry on the configuration of and the modifications by @xcite .",
    "the equations of mass , momentum , and internal energy conservation solved by zephyr are listed below :",

    "@xcite also assumed the number densities of protons and electrons are equal .",
    "this one - fluid approximation means that we are unable to include effects such as preferential ion heating , but the base properties of the solar wind produced are accurate .",

    "@xcite showed that @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the alfvnic and acoustic energy densities , respectively . with the above equations and wave action conservation , zephyr uses two levels of iteration to converge on a steady - state solution for the solar wind .",
    "the only free parameters zephyr requires as input are 1 ) the radial magnetic field profile and 2 ) the wave properties at the footpoint of the open flux tube . in this project",
    ", we do not change the wave properties at the photospheric base from the standard model presented by @xcite .",
    "the process of analyzing grids of models for this project led to some code fixes and we use this updated version of zephyr for all work presented here ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite used an isothermal , spherically symmetric corona to find a family of solutions to the hydrodynamic conservation equations , and stated that there was a single physically meaningful solution where the solar wind transitioned from subsonic at low heights to supersonic above the so - called `` critical point . '' for a considerable amount of time , there was concern in the community about the likelihood of the sun finding this single critical solution as parker postulated , rather than one of the many `` solar breeze '' solutions that never become supersonic .",
    "this uneasiness was put to rest when showed that this critical solution ( and the opposite , bondi accretion ) is stable for steady - state solutions .",
    "solar breeze solutions evolve to the trans - sonic critical solution after conditions that may have produced them are perturbed . + including a wave pressure term in the momentum equation and moving away from a spherically symmetric geometry allows the momentum conservation equation to produce multiple critical points where the wind speed reaches the local critical speed , creating an even more compicated solution topology .",
    "for this project , we have revised the method by which zephyr determines the true critical point from its original version used by @xcite .",
    "the revised method is described below .",
    "we solve for heights where the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the equation of motion , @xmath38 ( rewritten from equation ( 3b ) , neglecting sound speed terms ) is equal to zero , i.e. heights where the outflow speed is equal to the critical speed , whose radial dependence is defined by @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath41 , where `` isothermal '' means that in the definition , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the alfvnic mach number , @xmath44 . at heights where @xmath45 , the critical slope must have two non - imaginary values at the true critical point in order to create an x - point in the first place , and for the solar wind we take the positive slope : the range of possible topologies of critical points beyond the x - point has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the correct x - point , if there is more than one , lies at the global minimum of the integrated rhs of equation , based on the work of @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that if there are multiple critical points but only one of which is an x - point , the outermost root of the rhs is always the location of the x - point .",
    "however , if there are multiple x - points , the global minimum of the function @xmath46 below in equation is the location of the x - point that the stable wind solution must follow , i.e. @xmath47 this was reconfirmed in the more recent paper by @xcite .",
    "we now present some of the most important relations between the solar wind properties output by zephyr and the input grid of magnetic field profiles . for the number of iterations we allowed in zephyr , a subset of the models converged properly to a steady - state solution ( i.e. a model",
    "is considered converged if the internal energy convergence parameter @xmath48 as defined by @xcite is @xmath49 ) .",
    "we analyze only the results of these converged 428 models ( out of the total 672 ) in the figures presented in the following subsections .",
    "recall that the solar wind forecasting community relies heavily on a single relation between one property of the solar wind , speed at 1 au , and one ratio of magnetic field strengths , the expansion factor , equation .",
    "we compare the wsa relation to our results in section 3.2.1 , present a correlation between the alfvn wave heating rate and the magnetic field strength in section 3.2.2 and discuss important correlations between the magnetic field and temperatures in section 3.2.3 .",

    "the second mode of tempest use is the full outflow solver based on including both the gas and wave pressure terms .",
    "we will call this function `` prospero '' for ease in reference , and we outline the additional steps that prospero takes , after the inital solution is found using miranda , in section 4.2 .",
    "the first step towards the full outflow solution requires calculating an initial estimate the outflow without waves in order to calculate the density profile ( details in the following section ) .",
    "this first step , miranda , solves equation with the terms for gravity , the magnetic field gradient , and the temperature gradient , where the critical speed @xmath64 is set to the isothermal sound speed , @xmath78 .",
    "the temperature profiles that tempest uses already include the effects of turbulent heating , so we can effectively separate the two primary mechanisms by which alfvn waves accelerate the solar wind : turbulent heating and wave pressure .",
    "the solution found using miranda has only the first of these mechanisms included , and therefore will predict outflows at consistently lower speeds .",
    "+ with all terms in the parker equation defined , we find the critical point as discussed in section 3.1 . using the speed and radius of the correct critical point",
    ", we find the slope at the critical point using equation .",
    "once we have determined the critical point and slope , we use a 4th - order runge - kutta integrator to move away in both directions from this point . +",
    "the results from tempest without the wave pressure term are shown in red in figure [ fig : prospero ] and result in much lower speeds than zephyr produced , which is to be expected , as the additional pressure from the waves appears to provide an important acceleration for the solar wind .",
    "the mean wind speed at 1 au for the results from zephyr is 776 km s@xmath0 ( standard deviation is 197 km s@xmath0 ) ; the mean wind speed at 1 au after running miranda is only 357 km s@xmath0 with a standard deviation of 105 km s@xmath0 .",

    ", we have broken the models up by color according to the height of the critical point in order to highlight the relation between critical point height and asymptotic wind speed . +",
    "a key result from the tempest results is the recovery of a wsa - type relation , equation . in figure",
    "[ fig : tempest_wsa ] , we plot the relation along with the results from the 428 well - converged models in our grid .",
    "the arge & pizzo relation predicts the wind speed at the source surface based on the expansion factor ( equation ) .",
    "the relation should act as a lower bound for the wind speed predicted at 1 au , since there is further acceleration above 2.5 @xmath19 .",
    "this is exactly what we see for the slower wind speeds , which is to be expected for a relation calibrated at the equator , which rarely sees the highest speed wind streams .",
    "both the zephyr and tempest models naturally produce a substantial spread around the mean wsa - type relation , highlighting the need the take the full magnetic field profile into account . +    , now for results from tempest .",
    "again , the red dashed line is wind speed _ at the source surface _ , given by equation , which should be lower than the wind speed at 1 au for most of the models .",
    "the blue dashed line , as in figure [ fig : zephyr_wsa ] , is the concordance relation given by @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in figure [ fig : zt ] , we show directly the wind speeds determined by both modes of tempest and by zephyr .",
    "the solutions found by miranda have a minimum speed at 1 au around 200 km s@xmath0 , similar to the observed lower limit of in situ measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : zt]a highlights the two discrete ways in which alfvn waves contribute to the acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "it is important to note that the scatter in comparing zephyr and a wsa prediction ( figure [ fig : zt]b ) is much greater than the scatter in the zephyr - tempest comparison , due to the magnetic variability ignored by using only the expansion factor to describe the geometry .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) difference in the zephyr - tempest comparison ( the blue points in figure [ fig : zt]a ) is 115 km s@xmath0 , while the rms difference in the zephyr - wsa comparison ( the red points in figure [ fig : zt]b ) is 228 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the average percent difference between the computed speeds for zephyr and those of the full mode of tempest for each model is just under 14% .",
    "we also ran the same 628 models through a version of tempest that directly reads in the temperature and reflection coefficient profiles , and the percent difference was just below 12% .",
    "we discuss other possible improvements to tempest to lower this scatter in section 6 .",
    "these numbers indicate that tempest , while it makes many simplifying assumptions , is a more consistent predictor of wind speeds than the traditional observationally - derived wsa approach , which does not specify any particular choice of the underlying physics that accelerates the wind",
    ". there does exist the possibility that wsa predictions better match observations than either tempest or zephyr , and our next steps will be to use the completed tempest code , in combination with magnetic extrapolations of the coronal field , to predict solar wind properties for specific time periods and compare them with in situ measurements .",
    "+        another important distinction between these two codes is cpu run - time .",
    "tempest runs over forty times faster than zephyr because it makes many simplifying assumptions .",
    "we intend to take advantage of the ease of parallel processing in python to improve this speed increase further in future versions of the code .",
    "we have used wtd models to heat the corona through dissipation of heat by turbulent cascade and accelerate the wind through increased gas pressure and additional wave pressure effects .",
    "our primary goal for this project is to improve empirical forecasting techniques for the steady - state solar wind .",
    "as we have shown , the community often relies on wsa modeling , based on a single parameter of the magnetic field expansion in open flux tubes . even with the advances of combining mhd simulations as the wsa - enlil model , comparisons between predictions and observations make it clear that further improvements are still necessary .",
    "an important point to make is that extrapolations from magnetograms show that many flux tube magnetic field strengths do not all monotonically decrease , so two models with identical expansion factors could result in rather different structures .",
    "we anticipate that tempest could easily be incorporated within an existing framework to couple it with a full mhd simulation above the source surface .",
    "+ the first code we discuss , zephyr , has been shown to correspond well with observations of coronal holes and other magnetic structures in the corona .",
    "we investigate here the results of a grid of models that spans the entire range of observed flux tube strengths throughout several solar cycles to test the full parameter space of all possible open magnetic field profiles .",
    "+ zephyr also provides us with temperature - magnetic field correlations that help to take out much of the computation time for a stand - alone code , tempest , that solves the momentum conservation equation for the outflow solution of the solar wind based on a magnetic field profile .",
    "the solar physics community has come a long way since parker s spherically symmetric , isothermal corona , but the groundwork laid by this early theory is still fully applicable .",
    "+ the special case presented by pseudostreamers is an ongoing area of our analysis .",
    "pseudostreamers do not contribute to the heliospheric current sheet and they seem to be a source of the slow solar wind .",
    "the community does not fully understand the differences in the physical properties of the solar wind that may emanate from pseudostreamers and helmet streamers , although observational evidence suggests the slow wind is generated from these areas or the edges of coronal holes .",
    "our results from both codes do not currently recreate the bimodal distribution of wind speeds observed at 1 au .",
    "it is unclear whether this is due to the inclusion of many unphysical flux tube models or because the fast wind and the slow wind are generated by _",
    "different _ physical mechanisms .",
    "+ one slightly troubling feature of the zephyr and tempest model results is a relative paucity of truly `` slow '' wind streams ( @xmath103 km s@xmath0 ) in comparison to the observed solar wind .",
    "however , @xcite showed that many of the slowest wind streams at 1 au were the result of gradual deceleration due to stream interactions between 0.1 and 1 au .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that zephyr models of near - equatorial quiet - sun stream lines exhibited a realistic distribution of slow speeds at 0.1 au , but they exhibited roughly 150 km s@xmath0 of extra acceleration out to 1 au when modeled in zephyr without stream interactions .",
    "clearly , taking account of the development of corotating interaction regions and other stream - stream effects is key to producing more realistic predictions at 1 au .",
    "+ another important avenue of future work will be to compare predictions of wind speeds from tempest with in situ measurements , when the results from zephyr and tempest agree to a greater extent .",
    "we are already able to reproduce well - known correlations and linear fits from observations , but accurate forecasting is our goal .",
    "other ways in which forecasting efforts can be improved that tempest does not address include better lower boundary conditions on and coronal extrapolation of @xmath104 , moving from 1d to a higher dimensional code , and including kinetic effects of a multi - fluid model ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "+ space weather is dominated by both coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and high - speed wind streams .",
    "the latter is well - modeled by the codes presented in this paper , and these high - speed streams produce a greatly increased electron flux in the earth s magnetosphere , which can lead to satellite disruptions and power - grid failure .",
    "understanding the sun s effect on the heliosphere is also important for the study of other stars , especially in the ongoing search for an earth analog .",
    "the sun is an indespensible laboratory for understanding stellar physics due to the plethora of observations available .",
    "the modeling we have done in this project marks an important step toward full understanding of the coronal heating problem and identifying sources of solar wind acceleration .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation graduate research fellowship under grant no .",
    "dge-1144152 and by the nsf shine program under grant no .",
    "the authors obtained the omni solar wind data from the gsfc / spdf omniweb interface and thank david mccomas and ruth skoug ( ace / swepam ) and charles smith and norman ness ( ace / mag ) for providing the majority of the omni measurements used in this paper . l.n.w .",
    "also thanks the harvard astronomy department for the student travel grant and loomis fund .",
    "one of the primary differences between the zephyr and tempest codes is the way in which internal energy conservation is handled .",
    "zephyr finds a self - consistent solution for the equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation , including the physical processes of alfvn wave - driven turbulent heating .",
    "tempest is meant to be a stand - alone code that runs faster by making reasonable assumptions about these processes .",
    "to do so , we use correlations with the magnetic field to set up the temperature and alfvn wave reflection coefficient profiles . we describe this process here .",
    "+ the temperature profile can be described by a relatively constant - temperature chromosphere that extends to the transition region height , @xmath84 , a sharp rise to the location of the temperature peak , @xmath107 , followed by a continued gradual decrease .",
    "we found that @xmath84 was best correlated with the strength of the magnetic field at @xmath108 r@xmath3 , and this fit ( with pearson correlation coefficient @xmath109 ) is given by @xmath110 .",
    "we then chose evenly - spaced heights @xmath71 in log - space to set the temperature profile according to the following set of linear fits in log - log space with the location along the magnetic field profile that best correlated ( pearson coefficients @xmath111 given for each ) : @xmath112    we looked for correlations in the residuals of each of these fits , and found well - correlated ( @xmath113 ) terms for the first two heights , at @xmath114 r@xmath3 and @xmath115 r@xmath3 .",
    "we added the following terms to the @xmath116 estimates given above in order to improve the overall correlation , @xmath117    after adding these terms , the correlation coefficients improved to @xmath118 at @xmath119 and @xmath120 at @xmath121 . with all of these fitted values",
    ", we then constructed the temperature profile with the following continuous piecewise function , where the chromosphere is at a constant temperature @xmath122 k and @xmath123 : @xmath124^{2/7 } & : z_{tr } < z \\le 0.02 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot}\\\\      10^{x } , x = \\left(at(0.02 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) + \\frac{at(0.2 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) - at(0.02 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot})}{\\log_{10}(0.2 ) - \\log_{10}(0.02 ) } ( \\log_{10}(z ) + 1.7)\\right ) & : 0.02 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } < z \\le 0.2 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot}\\\\      10^{x } , x = \\left(at(0.2 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) + \\frac{at(2.0 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) - at(0.2 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot})}{\\log_{10}(2.0 ) - \\log_{10}(0.2 ) } ( \\log_{10}(z ) + 0.7)\\right ) & : 0.2 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } < z \\le 2.0 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot}\\\\      10^{x } , x = \\left(at(2.0 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) + \\frac{at(20 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) - at(2.0 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot})}{\\log_{10}(20 ) - \\log_{10}(2.0 ) } ( \\log_{10}(z ) - 0.3)\\right ) & : 2.0 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot }",
    "< z \\le 20 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot}\\\\      10^{x } , x = \\left(at(20 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) + \\frac{at(200 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot } ) - at(20 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot})}{\\log_{10}(200 ) - \\log_{10}(20 ) } ( \\log_{10}(z ) - 1.3)\\right ) & : z > 20 { \\rm ~r}_{\\odot }    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] + we proceeded with a similar method to create the alfvn wave reflection coefficient @xmath91 used in tempest .",
    "for the same evenly spaced in log - space heights ( @xmath125 r@xmath3 ) , we found linear fits between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "they are ( with pearson coefficients @xmath111 ) :      it is important to note tht the correlations are not as strong for this set of fits as they were for the temperature profile .",
    "however , we found no additional strong correlations in the residuals , and the effect due to the difference in the reflection coefficient between zephyr and tempest is small . finally , with these fits we defined the following continuous piecewise function , @xmath129 : @xmath130 + the final step we followed to set up both the temperature and reflection coefficient profiles was to smooth each of the piecewise functions with a bartlett window @xmath131 of width @xmath132 , where @xmath133 these final profiles are presented in figures [ fig : tempest_temps]b and [ fig : refl]b ."
