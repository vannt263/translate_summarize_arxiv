    "existing schemes for quantum teleportation are not suited to the formidable task of transferring quantum states of _ complex material systems _ such as molecules , to a distant node , where they can be recreated .",
    "entanglement of spin or pseudospin states by dissociation has been studied for some time already @xcite .",
    "recently it has been suggested that dissociation into a translationally entangled pair of fragments , followed by a collision of one fragment with an atomic wavepacket , can be used to teleport the wavepacket @xcite .    here",

    "our proposal combines three schemes whose principles are well established : ( a ) the dissociation of a molecule into fragments , whose internal and translational states are naturally entangled ( correlated ) @xcite ; ( b ) the complete faithful mapping of the ( unknown ) states of the correlated fragments onto those of the photons , via intracavity stimulated raman processes @xcite , performed in parallel in two cavities ; ( c ) the transmission of the photons , tailored to form time - symmetric pulses , to two counterpart cavities at the distant node , where they produce the time - reversal of the aforementioned mapping , i.e. , reproduce the quantum state of the fragments @xcite .",
    "and @xmath0 pass through the partially overlapping cavities @xmath1 and @xmath2 and pump fields , respectively , generating two correlated photons .",
    "the photons then leak from the cavities through the front mirrors .",
    "( b ) level scheme of dissociating fragments.,width=321 ]    the following procedure is envisaged for the task at hand ( fig .",
    "[ su_as1 ] ) .",
    "a cold molecule having velocity @xmath3 is dissociated , via a single- or two - photon process , to an energy - specific state of two identical molecular or atomic fragments , @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "each fragment can occupy one of the two internal metastable states , labeled @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( even if many internal states are populated by the dissociation process , we can single out the two that satisfy the resonance conditions detailed below ) . for a given dissociation energy , the fragments velocities @xmath7 along the @xmath8-axis depend on the internal excitation state of the system .",
    "therefore we can place two empty optical cavities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , aligned along the @xmath9 axis , at positions such that only a pair of fragments in their single - excitation state @xmath10 enters both cavities , all other outcomes being idle events .",
    "this state is entangled and symmetrized or antisymmetrized , depending on the molecular configuration .",
    "under the raman - resonance condition , each fragment , passing through the sequence of partially overlapping cavity ( quantized ) and pump ( classical ) fields , undergoes population transfer to the final state @xmath11 , via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , and adds to the corresponding cavity a single photon at a frequency @xmath12 _ uniquely determined _ by the initial internal and translational state . upon leaving their cavities through the partially transparent front mirrors ,",
    "the two entangled photons encode the dissociative state : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the momenta of the fragments in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "let us now discuss a possible realization of the intracavity raman resonance conditions [ fig .",
    "[ su_as1](b ) ] . a bichromatic pump field , containing the frequency components @xmath15 and @xmath16 and aligned along the @xmath8-axis , resonantly couples the two ground states @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the excited states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "each cavity supports two modes with the frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the energies of the corresponding atomic states .",
    "thus the mode frequencies of the two cavities are shifted from each other by the difference of the pump - field doppler shifts for the two fragments , @xmath25 , while the two modes of each cavity have a frequency difference close to that of the two excited levels , @xmath26 .",
    "this choice ensures the two - photon raman resonance between either of the states @xmath5 or @xmath6 and the final state @xmath11 for both fragments .",

    "one of the requirements of stirap is the `` counterintuitive '' order of the fields @xcite , achieved by shifting , by distance @xmath33 , the pump - field maximum from that of the cavity field . for a fragment traveling with the velocity @xmath34 , the time - dependences of the cavity-(vacuum ) and pump fields rabi frequencies",

    "thus , the fragment , being initially in state @xmath42 , ends up after the interaction in state @xmath11 , with a photon added into the corresponding cavity mode @xmath43 .",
    "a standard analysis @xcite reveals the following requirements for the system to obey the evolution of the dark state ( [ dark ] ) : ( i ) the condition for adiabatic following should be satisfied , namely , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",

    "( iv ) finally , the mode spacing of the cavity @xmath54 should exceed both the fragment - cavity coupling strength and the decay rate of the final state : @xmath55 .",
    "then , for a given initial state of the fragment @xmath42 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 , the photon will be added only into the resonant mode of the cavity at frequency @xmath43 .",

    "the output field of each cavity is related to the input and internal fields of that cavity by @xcite @xmath60 hence , for a vacuum input to the cavities , the output field is determined by the intracavity field , whose evolution is given by eq .",

    "thus , according to ( [ aout ] ) , the entangled ( correlated ) state of the two intracavity fields is mapped onto the state of the outgoing photon pair .",
    "one can reconstruct the initial entangled state of the two dissociating fragments by making homodyne measurements of the output field of the two cavities for many repetitions of the dissociation process and using the method of quantum state tomography @xcite .    for numerical analysis of the intracavity process and the photon transmission",

    ", several additional states of the system , which are decoupled from the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , have to be taken into account , as they enter through the possible relaxation channels .",

    "the corresponding coupling constants for the cavity having the mode - waist @xmath88 @xmath89 m are @xmath90 mhz and @xmath91 mhz and the cavity linewidth @xmath92 mhz .",
    "reduction of the fragment - cavity coupling constants by a factor of 4 ( ! ) lowers the transfer efficiency from 99% to 90%.,width=321 ]    after the fragments have interacted with the corresponding cavity and pump fields and the generated photons have propagated away from the cavities , the system is reset to its initial state .",
    "we can then repeat the process , generating a second pair of photons , and so on .",
    "the time interval between two subsequent photon - pair transmissions must exceed @xmath93 $ ] , which limits their maximum repetition rate .",
    "since on average half of the dissociation events are idle , yielding a pair of fragments that are both in either @xmath94 or @xmath95 states , the actual repetition rate is given by @xmath96 . with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ graph ] , the maximal repetition rate is @xmath97 khz . since the fragments velocities @xmath7 along the @xmath8-axis depend on the internal excitation state of the system , one can resort to post - selection , by detecting only those pairs of fragments that have successfully crossed the cavities and generated an entangled photon pair , thereby discarding all other idle events .",
    "such post - selection , together with the fact that the fidelity of entanglement transfer between the fragments and the photons is close to 1 , would make our scheme deterministic , rather that probabilistic , as opposed to the spontaneous parametric down - conversion schemes @xcite .",
    "the outlined processes are also feasible for molecular dissociation into two molecular fragments in the electronic ground state . as an example consider the photolysis of cyanogen by a 193 nm laser via the reaction channel @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 stand for vibrational and rotational states , respectively , of the electronic ground state @xmath101 of cn @xcite . by adjusting the positions of the two cavities and the frequencies of the cavity and pump fields ,",
    "the two ground states @xmath102 and the final state @xmath11 can be selected from this vib - rotational ground state manifold , while the excited states @xmath103 can be selected from among the excited electronic state manifold @xmath104 .    a possible conceptual counterargument for the use of our scheme may be that , depending on the initial state @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the fragment recoil due to",
    "the pump - photon absorption will be @xmath105 or @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "a subsequent measurement of the fragment s translational state will , in principle , disclose its initial internal state .",
    "consequently , the final motional states of the two fragments will be entangled with the states of the two generated photons , without achieving a complete state mapping from the fragments onto the cavity photons .",
    "however , one can easily check that , since the molecule is dissociated in a region having the size @xmath107 @xmath89 m , in order to have each dissociating fragment pass through the corresponding cavity waist , the uncertainty of the momentum distribution of the fragment must satisfy @xmath108 , which is 30 times larger than the photon - recoil difference @xmath109 . therefore , even in principle one will not be able to resolve that difference and deduce the initial state from the fragments momenta .",
    "we note that a fragment crossing a standing wave cavity at a node , where the electric field amplitude vanishes , will not interact with the cavity mode and the stirap process will not take place .",
    "one possibility to overcome this difficulty is to allow the fragment to cross the cavity axis at an angle slightly different from 90@xmath110 , which can be achieved by tilting the cavity .",
    "another possibility would be to use a running - wave cavity .",
    "so far we have only considered the state transfer from a pair of dissociating fragments to photons . utilizing the transmission protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite , one may use the generated entangled photon pair to induce the _",

    ". this procedure is applicable to molecular fragments in the electronic ground state , but not to atomic fragments whose final state lifetime @xmath114 is shorter than their time of flight between the dissociation region and the corresponding cavity . let us therefore consider an alternative",
