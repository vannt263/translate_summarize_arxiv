    "one might argue that points @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 define a steep power law relation ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "any such correlation , however , is greatly weakened by the five h@xmath3 upper - limits and the wide range in @xmath14 allowed by the @xmath8 dispersion , which together comprise a large systematic uncertainty .",
    "hi in the cartwheel s outer ring reaches @xmath165 m@xmath2 pc@xmath16 and , like h@xmath3 , appears independent of @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "@xmath157 ) .",
    "this resembles the hi `` saturation '' observed in spiral galaxies ( @xmath166 m@xmath2 pc@xmath16 ; k07 , b08 , s11 ) , though with significantly higher @xmath12 . because @xmath74 is so small , the outer ring s combined hi@xmath167h@xmath3 sf law is , in effect , the hi sf law ( fig .",
    "@xmath157 ) . for local spirals",
    "the exact opposite opposite is true .",
    "a vertical line can be drawn through all but one point ( within the uncertainties ) for the cartwheel s outer ring , leading to the unusual result that sf appears independent of the local neutral gas surface density in any form : atomic , molecular or combined .    normal sf laws break down on small spatial scales and after @xmath168 myr for individual sf regions ( e.g. , s10 )",
    ". however , given the @xmath169  kpc@xmath72 area of regions @xmath116 and the evidence for continuous sf ( @xmath1701 ) as the rings propagate , other factors must be responsible for the cartwheel s ( and am0644 - 741 s ) peculiar sf law .",
    "it is moreover extremely unlikely that the entire sf region populations of both outer rings happen to be in the same brief ( @xmath171 myr ) co - faint / h@xmath56-luminous phase .",
    "consumption of the ring s ism due to high @xmath23 could deflect points to the left in fig .",
    "indeed , @xcite noted a significant decrease in @xmath12 across sections @xmath172 , which is visible in fig .",
    "however the observed @xmath23 would require @xmath173 gyr - roughly @xmath36-times the ring s estimated age - to shift points @xmath127 and @xmath128 to their observed positions starting from any of the spiral galaxy sf laws shown . while gas depletion effects may be at work they can not be entirely responsible for the observed sf law unless @xmath23 was much higher in the past .",
    "co emission from the cartwheel s outer ring indicates an extremely h@xmath3 poor ism even after accounting for its sub - solar metallicity . in trying to understand this situation we discount the possibility that we are viewing the cartwheel ( and am0644 - 741 ) just as their molecular reservoirs have been exhausted , since both rings high @xmath12 favors the rapid conversion of hi to h@xmath3",
    ". it may be the case that conditions in the starburst ring lead to enhanced destruction of h@xmath3 so that even a metallicity - appropriate @xmath8 reveals little molecular gas .",
    "this however leaves the question of how sf is triggered so efficiently in the remaining h@xmath3 .",
    "alternately , the starburst rings may act to make co an unreliable proxy for h@xmath3 .",
    "the ability of co to trace h@xmath3 in a molecular cloud ( mc ) depends sensitively on the cloud s net visual extinction , @xmath174 , which is proportional to the product of its metallicity and h@xmath3 column density ( @xmath7 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . small or low-@xmath31 ( or both ) mcs in active star forming regions may inadequately shield the fragile co molecule and as a result become extremely co - faint .",
    "reduced metallicity substantially compounds this effect .",
    "we propose that the ism s long confinement in the starburst rings of these systems can result in a state characterized by smaller mcs and a diffuse h@xmath3 component due to the accumulated damage from embedded ob stars and sne ( hhr ) .",
    "this helps explain the extremely low average @xmath31 ( @xmath175 @xmath176 ) we derive for am0644 - 741 s starburst quadrant .",
    "if this characterizes the overall state of the ism then low-@xmath7 mcs may dominate high @xmath23 regions , resulting in a co - faint molecular ism and low inferred @xmath29 . a further dependence on metallicity and local @xmath23",
    "would be expected to produce a peculiar sf law like that in fig.@xmath177 .",
    "conversely , the inner ring s",
    "@xmath178normal @xmath14 , @xmath74 , @xmath154 and sf law would be a consequence of its lower @xmath23 and age ( @xmath179 vs. @xmath180 myr ) : the inner ring s ism has yet to reach the outer ring s state .",
    "these possibilities can be further tested observationally .",
    "dense ( @xmath181 @xmath176 ) gas in cloud cores should be better protected from the destructive effects of massive stars and is , moreover , the component directly connected with sf @xcite .",
    "observations of the cartwheel and am0644 - 741 using hcn or hco+ rotational transitions may uncover @xmath178normal sf laws .",
    "infrared / submillimeter dust emission would additionally provide reliable estimates of h@xmath3 in the rings independent of co ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our analysis further suggests that high @xmath23 and long residence time are both required to reach the peculiar ism state we infer in starburst rings .",
    "observations of _ young _ ring galaxies ( i.e. , age @xmath182 myr ) would in this case be expected to show more normal @xmath74 and sf laws .",
    "preliminary support for this is suggested by the global @xmath74 ( @xmath183 ) of the young ( @xmath184  myr ) ring galaxy arp@xmath185 .",
    "state of the art ring galaxy models incorporating a multi - phase ism and the effects of massive stars and sne will also help place these ideas on a firmer physical basis .",
    "both of the cartwheel s rings are gas rich , expanding and forming stars , though with large differences in their relative sfr , @xmath23 and ages .",
    "they appear dominated by different ism phases : molecular in the inner and atomic in the outer . even with a metallicity appropriate @xmath8 the outer ring s h@xmath3 content appears strikingly low for its star formation activity , which leads directly to its unusually low @xmath154 and peculiar sf law .",
    "by contrast the inner ring appears normal .",
    "similar results were found in am0644 - 741 s @xmath186 kpc diameter starburst ring , leading us to reject the possibility that we are observing both ring galaxies just as their h@xmath3 reservoirs are consumed or when their sf regions simultaneously attain a brief co - faint / h@xmath56-luminous phase .",
    "either highly efficient sf occurs in a h@xmath3-poor ism in the rings of these systems or rotational transitions of @xmath0co do not accurately trace h@xmath3 .",
    "our observations are consistent with the second explanation if the ism of both starburst rings possess abundant small and/or low-@xmath7 mcs that inadequately shield co molecules .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the ism s long residence in the outer rings and is very likely compounded by sub - solar metallicity in addition to ( limited ) gas depletion effects .",
    "if so , the outer ring s @xmath29 and @xmath14 may be substantially greater than that inferred by co. we expect such a state to characterize large and robustly star forming ring galaxies and possibly starburst nuclear rings associated with gravitational resonances .",
    "the large departures from a standard sf law we derive in the outer rings of the cartwheel and am0644 - 741 represent interesting puzzles that a comprehensive theory of star formation should be able to address .",
