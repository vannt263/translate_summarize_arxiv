    "the nature of dark energy ( de ) is one of the main puzzles of modern cosmology .",
    "de was first required by snia data ( see , e.g. , perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 , riess et al . 1998 ) , that indicate an accelerated cosmic expansion . a flat universe with @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "is also favored by an analysis of cmb and lss observations ( see , e.g. , tegmark et al . ,",
    "2001 ; netterfield et al , 2002 ; percival et al . , 2002 ; efstathiou et al , 2002 ; schuecker et al . , 2003 ; pogosian et al.,2003 ; here @xmath6 : matter , baryon density parameters ; @xmath7 : hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ; cmb : cosmic microwave background ; lss : large scale structure ) .",
    "the cosmic component allowing flatness , in spite of @xmath4 , should not be observable in the number  of  particle representation , in the present epoch .",
    "if this component is a false vacuum , whose pressure and energy density ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) have ratio @xmath10 , a severe fine tuning of @xmath9 , at the end of the electroweak transition , is required ; in fact , before it , the vacuum energy density could be more than @xmath11 times greater than now .",
    "a possible alternative , apparently reducing fine tuning requirements , is that de arises from a self  interacting scalar field @xmath12 ( dynamical dark energy or _ quintessence _ ; see , e.g. , ratra ",
    "peebles 1988 , rp hereafter ; wetterich 1988 , 1995 ; ferreira & joyce 1998 ; perrotta & baccigalupi 1999 ; steinhardt et al .",
    "1999 ; zlatev et al .",
    "1999 ; albrecht & skordis 2000 ; amendola 2000 ; brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) . for dynamical de , @xmath13    @xmath14 being the self  interaction potential , @xmath15 is the scale factor and dots indicate derivatives in respect to the conformal time @xmath16 . the ratio @xmath17 becomes negative as soon as @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , it is @xmath20 and dynamical de approaches open cdm . still smaller @xmath21 ratios allow to approach @xmath22 and a @xmath0cdm behavior . in order to work out @xmath17 and its time variations , friedman equations , in association with the equation of motion of @xmath12 , are to be integrated .",
    "solutions clearly depend on the shape of @xmath23 , which , in principle , is largely arbitrary . however , among potentials admitting a _ tracker _ solution , a particular relevance is kept by rp and sugra ( brax & martin 1999 , 2000 ) expressions @xmath24 which originate within the frame of supersymmetric ( susy ) theories . in the expressions ( 1.2 )",
    ", @xmath25 is the planck mass and @xmath0 is an energy scale , currently set in the interval @xmath26@xmath27gev , ranging between the electroweak scale and the susy soft breaking scale .",
    "the potentials ( 1.2 ) also depend on the exponent @xmath28 ; once @xmath0 and @xmath29 are assigned , however , @xmath28 is univocally determined .",
    "the rp and sugra potentials are also indicative of the opposite cases , when @xmath17 shows slow or fast time variations , respectively .",
    "dynamical de and @xmath0cdm predict quite similar observational results , in most cases .",
    "this is a point in favor of dynamical de , as it is known that @xmath0cdm allows a good fit of most available data .",
    "it is however important to devise suitable experiments whose outputs enable us to probe de nature ; if de is dynamical , they should also enable us to fix the expression of @xmath23 and the values of the parameters on which @xmath23 depends .    here",
    "we show that measures of anisotropy and polarization of cmb at large angular scales can constrain @xmath23 .",
    "if favorable ( but not exceptional ) conditions are fulfilled , polarization measures , at a sensitivity level comparable with experiments in progress , can provide significant information , possibly _ excluding _ that a rp potential describes de .",
    "we shall show this point by performing a likelihood analysis , assuming that polarization measures come from an experiment similar to the sky polarization observatory ( sport : see , e.g. , macculi et al , 2000 ; carretti et al , 2000 ; peverini et al , 2001 ) , considering both a noise level that the experiment will attain and a lower noise level , as well .",
    "our results , however , are not directly related to the above experiment and can be easily extrapolated to other observational contexts .",
    "in the present cosmic epoch , although diffuse baryonic materials are almost completely ionized , the scattering time for cmb photons @xmath30s exceeds the hubble time @xmath31s and the universe is transparent to cmb photons .",
    "these figures can be extrapolated to the past , but , while @xmath32 , the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath15 depends on the cosmological model . in an expansion regime dominated by",
    "non  relativistic matter , a fully ionized universe is opaque to cmb at redshifts @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath35 ( standard bbns limits ; see , e.g. , dolgov 2002 for a recent review ) and @xmath360.7 , we have @xmath37 , safely above any expected value for the reionization redshift @xmath38 .",
    "no reasonable cosmological model allows a substantial reduction of such @xmath39 .",
    "while , therefore , @xmath40 , its specific value depends on the model and , in particular , on the reionization history . if reionization is a single and sudden event , it can be synthesized by a value of @xmath38 . in fig .  1 we show how @xmath3 is related to @xmath38 , for a wide set of cosmological models .",
    "in general , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , if we require @xmath43 or 0.16 .",
    "data can constrain the reionization history in indirect ways .",
    "qso spectra ( djorgovski et al . 2001 ; becker et al . 2001 ) show that at least a fraction of neutral hydrogen is present , in the intergalactic medium , at @xmath45 .",
    "these very authors , however , warn the reader against an immediate conclusion that @xmath46 ; an ionization rate @xmath47 can cause the gunn  peterson effect observed .",
    "their finding , however , was taken as an indication of the expected range of @xmath38 .",
    "another constraint can be found , if the ionizing flux observed today is extrapolated to high @xmath44 ; in this way , miralda  escud ( 2002 ) found that that the photon flux is able to reionize the cosmic hydrogen at @xmath4110 and @xmath48 .",
    "pushing farther the theoretical analysis , tegmark ( 1997 ) estimated that , at @xmath49 , a fraction @xmath50 of baryonic matter is in fluctuations of @xmath51@xmath52 , already in non  linear growth .",
    "they can cool and turn into massive stars thanks to molecular hydrogen radiation .",
    "however , as soon as thermonuclear processes ignite , stars produce photons hard enough to turn all hydrogen into atomic ( or plasma ) state and star formation is stopped until much greater fluctuations ( @xmath53 ) enter a non  linear regime ( see , e.g. , haiman 1997 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . however , haiman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , oh ( 2001 ) and venkatesan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the situation can be even more complicated , as x  ray heating might enhance the formation of molecular hydrogen",
    ". from such pictures , cen ( 2002 ) and whyithe & loeb ( 2002 ) try to deduce the reionization history . according to them , when the first popiii stars form",
    ", a first high@xmath44 reionization occurs .",
    "popiii stars eventually produce metals that , in turn , allow less massive stars to form and , therefore , the ionizing photon flux is reduced soon",
    ". then the overall ionization rate is set by a balance between star formation and hydrogen recombination ; the former overwhelming the latter at a redshift @xmath54 , when @xmath55 safely approaches unity . at such redshift ,",
    "this picture meets miralda  escud ( 2002 ) conclusions and is therefore also coherent with the ionizing flux observed today .",
    "these pictures are qualitatively realistic , although their quantitative aspects are still uncertain .",
    "it should be emphasized that different reionization histories , also when they yield the same @xmath3 , give different cmb angular spectra . in this work",
    "we shall quantitatively explore simple reionization histories , where a single reionization event yields @xmath43 or 0.16 and comment on the extension of our results to more complex histories .",
    "the former @xmath3 value agrees with miralda  escud ( 2002 ) estimate .",
    "the latter value assumes an earlier reionization , implicitly allowing a small hydrogen fraction ( @xmath56 ) to remain neutral until @xmath57 , to account for the observed gunn ",
    "peterson effect in high@xmath44 qso spectra .",
    "it should also be reminded that , until cmb spectra analysis is restricted to anisotropy data , no significant constraint on @xmath3 can be set ; stompor et al ( 2002 ) , using balloon data , can only set the limit @xmath58 , at the 2@xmath59 level .",
    "limits are so loose because of the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath60 ( primeval spectral index ) , in cmb anisotropy data . in a recent paper , colombo & bonometto ( 2003 )",
    "discussed how much such degeneracy can be removed using polarization measures .",
    "recent observations ( kovac et al .",
    "2002 ) apparently confirmed that cmb is polarized , but the sensitivity level and the angular scales probed by such observations were not adequate to reduce the above @xmath60@xmath3 degeneracy .    in this work",
    "we explore what large angular scale cmb polarization data can tell us on de nature .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that all model parameters are obtained from measures at smaller angular scales and concentrate on the effect of the potential @xmath14 on large angular scales , when @xmath3 is large .",
    "the linear evolution of density fluctuations in models with a de component yields the angular spectra @xmath61 ; @xmath62 stand for anisotropy , @xmath63 and @xmath64mode polarization and anisotropy  polarization cross correlation ( x = te ) only @xmath63mode polarization is considered through this paper . in fig .",
    "[ 2fig][5fig ] we show the spectra @xmath65 when the potential is rp or sugra and @xmath3 is 0.08 or 0.16 , for a set of values of the energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "all spectra are obtained with suitable extensions of cmbfast .",
    "[ 2fig ] to [ 5fig ] show that the nature of de and , in particular , the value of the energy scale @xmath0 , both for rp and sugra models , display their main effects on low@xmath2 te correlation spectra .",
    "in particular , figs.[2fig ] and [ 3fig ] show that @xmath66 is negative , at low @xmath2 , for rp potentials , while , in sugra models , such feature is absent .",
    "negative @xmath66 are not an exceptional feature : all models yield alternate intervals of positive and negative @xmath66 as @xmath2 increases . in most spatially flat models , however , the @xmath66 spectrum , at low @xmath2 values , starts from positive values . on the contrary , open cdm models , when @xmath3 is large enough ,",
    "start with negative @xmath66 , al low @xmath2 .    in the discussion section , we shall discuss why rp models share this feature with open models .",
    "this arises from the way how @xmath9 scales with @xmath15 , similar to the scaling of the curvature term in open models . on the contrary , in @xmath0cdm models",
    ", @xmath9 does not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "when the scaling of @xmath9 with @xmath15 is mild and , therefore , close to @xmath0cdm , no low@xmath2 negative @xmath66 is expected .",
    "in this section we aim to determine the likelihood of different models in respect to possible results of anisotropy and polarization measurements , obtained through definite observational apparati , for specific cosmological models .",
    "in particular , polarization data sets are built with reference to the features of the sport experiment .    at variance from other space experiments ( wmap and planck )",
    ", sport has been explicitly designed to measure the stokes parameters q and u and to minimize systematics and instrumental polarization .",
    "sport will observe a sky area with declination @xmath67 ( @xmath68 of the whole sky ) .",
    "the lifetime of the experiment will be at least 1.5 years , but an extension is likely .",
    "here we assume that pixels are distributed according to the healpix package , with @xmath69 , and smoothed with a gaussian beam of fwhm of @xmath70 . we therefore have , on the whole sky , 3072 pixels , whose centers lie at an average angular distance of @xmath71 .",
    "once polar caps are excluded , there remain 2448 pixels , providing measures of the stokes parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ".    sport polarimeters will provide no anisotropy data .",
    "such information will be however available through other experiments ( cobe , wmap ) .",
    "of course , anisotropy data probe a different sky area , i.e. the whole sky , excluding the area with galactic declination @xmath74 , where contamination by the milky way is severe .",
    "( on the contrary , such contamination can be assumed to be under control , for polarization data ; see , e.g. , bruscoli et al . 2002 ; tucci et al . 2002 . ) in this sky area there are 1984 pixels . for 1360 of them ,",
    "both anisotropy and polarization data are supposed to be available .",
    "random noise ( @xmath75 ) is included in artificial data , assuming it to be uncorrelated , both among pixels and between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in the case of polarization measures .",
    "we assume @xmath76k for temperature data ( as expected for wmap measurements , extended to 4 years , scaled to the sport resolution ) . on the contrary ,",
    "we consider different noise levels for polarization data .    at present",
    ", the sport experiment team expects a pixel noise level of    0.2truecm    @xmath77 @xmath78k ,    where @xmath79 is the experiment s lifetime in years while @xmath80 indicates the detection efficiency .",
    "our analysis considers @xmath75 s in the interval comprised from 0.1 to 1@xmath81k per pixel . even at its highest value , this noise is consistent with sport claims only if @xmath82 and efficiency approaches unity .",
    "however , the sport payload is to be delivered in more than one year and there is room for some further improvement in the apparati .      in this analysis",
    "we take @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and a primeval spectral index @xmath86 .",
    "we considered also different values for these parameters , but the likelihood distributions are essentially independent from them . on the contrary , such distributions depend on the choice of @xmath3 ; as already outlined , we studied likelihood distributions for @xmath87 and 0.16@xmath88 .",
    "we consider first rp models , for @xmath89gev@xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as is known , rp models are accelerated only if @xmath92gev and disagree with snia data at the 2@xmath59 level , when @xmath93gev . on the contrary , when @xmath94gev , the angular spectra of the model are hardly distinguishable from @xmath0cdm .",
    "accordingly , fits yielding @xmath94gev , for a rp model , indicate that data do not allow to appreciate that the model is different from @xmath0cdm .",
    "we consider then sugra models , for @xmath89gev@xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath95 .",
    "their @xmath1 correlation spectra show differences from @xmath0cdm and among themselves , although not so relevant as for rp .",
    "@xmath1 correlation spectra also depend on the reionization history . in this paper , such dependence",
    "is not explored and this is the main quantitative limitation to the results shown here .",
    "dealing with low @xmath2 s , cosmic variance must be carefully taken into account .",
    "we explore this point by simulating and analyzing a large number of artificial data sets .",
    "results will be both synthesized into average predictions and analyzed providing the frequency of possible determinations .",
    "we report first results for rp models , for @xmath89gev@xmath90 and @xmath91 . in figs .  6 and 7",
    "we show the average likelihood distributions for such models . in figs .",
    "[ 9fig ] and [ 10fig ] , we report the distributions of the 12 @xmath59 lower limits on @xmath0 , for @xmath87 and 0.16 , @xmath96 and @xmath91 , @xmath97k and 1@xmath81k .",
    "[ 12fig ] is analogous to fig .",
    "[ 6fig ] , but concerns a sugra model with @xmath98gev and @xmath99 ; among the cases considered here , this is the one which allows the best recovery of @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ 13fig ] , we report the distributions of the lower limits on @xmath0 for such model ( at 1@xmath100 ) .",
    "the above figures show that the energy scale @xmath0 can not be detected for sugra models , at least with large  angular  scale experiments .",
    "this is not only true at a noise level achievable by sport , but also when noise is reduced by a factor @xmath101 .",
    "the situation was better for rp models .",
    "the capacity of an experiment to distinguish a rp model from @xmath0cdm increases with the energy scale @xmath0 and the opacity @xmath3 , although being more sensitive to the former parameter .",
    "in fact , a substantial fraction of realizations , with @xmath102gev and @xmath87 , can be distinguished from @xmath0cdm , even at the 3@xmath59 level ; such fraction is only slightly greater for @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , only in quite a small fraction of realizations , rp can not be distinguished from @xmath0cdm , at the 2@xmath59 level . both with @xmath103 and 0.16 , also models with @xmath104gev",
    "can be distinguished from @xmath0cdm in a smaller ( but still substantial ) fraction of realizations , at least at the 2@xmath59 level .",
    "if we aim farther and try to determine @xmath0 , we meet substantial difficulties : even reducing the noise level by a factor @xmath101 , the best we can find is a lower limit on the order of magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , this can be fixed just in a fraction of realizations .",
    "let us first discuss how the likelihood distribution can be obtained from the spectra of a given model , taking into account that the number of pixels for anisotropy and polarization ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) in our ( artificial ) data are however different .",
    "let then @xmath107 be the anisotropy measured in @xmath105 pixels and @xmath108 and @xmath109 the stokes parameters measured in @xmath106 pixels . in general ,",
    "let us define vectors @xmath110 , of @xmath111 components , defining an observed state of anisotropy and polarization .",
    "once a @xmath0 value is assigned , the angular spectra @xmath112 are univocally determined . on the contrary ,",
    "a data vector @xmath113 , of @xmath114 components , built from them , is just a _ realization _ of such model : once the @xmath114 component vector @xmath113 is assigned , the value of @xmath0 is not univocally fixed .    a function @xmath115^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\exp   \\big [ -{1 \\over 2}{\\bf d^t } { \\bf m}^{-1 } { \\bf d } \\big ] \\eqno ( 5.1)\\ ] ] is then built , to yield the likelihood of a given set of @xmath116 ( i.e. , of a given @xmath0 value ) , if @xmath113 is observed .",
    "the main ingredient of @xmath117 is the correlation matrix @xmath118 ; here @xmath119 is the signal term and @xmath120 is due to the noise .",
    "the components @xmath121 yield the correlation between the @xmath122th and @xmath123th elements of data vectors @xmath124 corresponding to particular choices of @xmath125 , i.e. of @xmath0 values .",
    "the construction of the ( model dependent ) signal term , however , does not require to build explicitly the vectors @xmath124 .",
    "the procedure to be followed , in the case when both anisotropy and polarization data are available , is explicitly reported by zaldarriaga ( 1998 ) .",
    "the construction of the noise term is simpler , as we expect no noise correlation , and the matrix @xmath126 ( for @xmath127 ) and @xmath128 ( for @xmath129 ) is diagonal .    in",
    "what follows , the technical role of the @xmath130 spectra does not need to be further outlined and the likelihood function is explicitly considered to depend on @xmath0 . in particular , we assume that the most probable @xmath0 value , for a given anisotropy  polarization state @xmath113 , is the one which maximizes the likelihood . by integrating the likelihood distribution along the @xmath0 axis ,",
    "we are then able to find the intervals corresponding to 123@xmath131 levels .    in order to explore cosmic variance , 1000 realizations of each model",
    "were considered ; the likelihood curves plotted in the figs .",
    "56711 are averages of the results of such realizations .",
    "123@xmath100 value distributions , instead , allow to appreciate the spread among the results of each such realization .    the feature which explains why rp model likelihoods can enable us to distinguish them from @xmath0cdm , in several cases , is the negative te correlation at low @xmath2 . in the case of sugra models",
    "such te anticorrelation is absent and large angle data seem unsuitable to provide information on de nature .",
    "negative te correlations are essentially related to the simultaneous action of isw effect and cosmic opacity .",
    "the former effect is a consequence of the varying rate of expansion , when we pass from matter to curvature dominance , in open models , or from matter to vacuum dominance in @xmath0cdm models .",
    "however , while the former kind of passage , in the presence of cosmic opacity , does produce anticorrelation , the latter kind of passage does not .    the capacity of rp models to induce anticorrelation , as we shall see ,",
    "is related to their features , which more closely approach open cdm , rather than @xmath0cdm .",
    "the opposite is true for sugra models .",
    "a full understanding of model dynamics requires that the whole set of boltzmann equations , describing photon distribution , is followed in time .",
    "such equations are shown in a number of papers , together with equations ruling the dynamics of fluctuations in other components of a model ( see , e.g. , ma & bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "signs and other definitions that we adopt here are the same as in the public code cmbfast .",
    "let us then indicate by @xmath132 and @xmath133 the boltzmann components for anisotropy and polarization , respectively , @xmath134 and @xmath16 being the wave  number and the conformal time .    let then @xmath135 and @xmath136 be the free electron density and the thomson cross  section .",
    "the opacity to cmb photons reads then @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "let us report then the set of equations fulfilled by the @xmath139 components in spatially flat models : @xmath140 + { k \\over 2l+1 } [ l\\ , g_{l-1 } - ( l+1 ) g_{l+1 } ] ~ \\eqno ( 5.2f)\\ ] ] ( @xmath141 is the kronecker symbol ) . here @xmath142 is the only vehicle transferring signals from anisotropy to polarization .    in a non - flat geometries eq .",
    "( 5.2f ) becomes @xmath140 + { \\beta \\over 2l+1 } [ l b_l\\ , g_{l-1 } - ( l+1 ) b_{l+1 } g_{l+1 } ] ~ ; \\eqno ( 5.2o)\\ ] ] here @xmath143 and @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , @xmath146 being the present value of the hubble parameter .",
    "quite in general , when @xmath135 and , therefore , @xmath147 is large , all @xmath139 are exponentially damped . on the contrary , when @xmath135 is low , the polarization signal spreads along the @xmath139 component series .    in order to produce polarization , therefore , there must however be a seed coming from anisotropy , linked to the non  vanishing of the quadrupole term @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath148 becomes significant only when @xmath135 is very low , little polarization is produced on harmonics with @xmath2 corresponding to such @xmath134 .",
    "it is so for wavelengths @xmath149 entering the horizon well after recombination , which correspond to spectral components with @xmath150 , unless reionization occurs .",
    "this explains the sudden rise of @xmath151 in fig .",
    "25 , when @xmath152 is considered .",
    "let @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) be the value taken by @xmath155 ( @xmath139 ) at the present time @xmath156 .",
    "in spatially flat models , the angular spectra read @xmath157@xmath158 @xmath159 being the primeval fluctuation spectrum . in open model , angular spectra expressions",
    "are slightly more complex and read @xmath160@xmath161 here @xmath162 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath163 , both @xmath164 and @xmath165 return @xmath134 .    both eqs .",
    "( 5.2 ) and ( 5.4 ) indicate the presence of suitable shifts in the @xmath134space , when open models are considered .",
    "in particular , the @xmath166 coefficients in eq .",
    "( 5.2o ) are responsible for the shifts of @xmath167 peaks , while the shifts due to the passage from @xmath134 to @xmath164 and @xmath165 , in eq .",
    "( 5.4o ) , displace the power of the spectrum @xmath168 through the harmonics @xmath155 at small @xmath2 , i.e. on scales comparable with the curvature scale .",
    "apart of these geometric and power shifts , the main difference between flat and open models resides in the equation fulfilled by the gravitational field fluctuations @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in the synchronous gauge , for open models : @xmath171 ; \\eqno ( 5.5o)\\ ] ] here @xmath172 being the critical density at @xmath173 and @xmath174 indicates a sum over all ( relativistic or non  relativistic ) matter components .",
    "in the same gauge , for flat models with de : @xmath175 , \\eqno ( 5.5f)\\ ] ] where the de term has been set in evidence , with its possible fluctuations . the wave  numbers @xmath176 and @xmath177 are shifted by @xmath178 .",
    "once again this corresponds to a shift in the @xmath134space .",
    "let us notice soon that , in a @xmath0cdm model , no de fluctuations exist and , furthermore , @xmath179 , so that the second term at the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 5.5f ) vanishes .    in models with dynamical de , instead",
    ", @xmath180 does not vanish and , in general , @xmath181 .",
    "accordingly , the second term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( 5.5f ) may read @xmath182 ( the ratio in the last parenthesis tells us how de energy scales with @xmath15 ) .",
    "this term is then analogous to the second term in square bracket in eq .",
    ". it would coincide with it if @xmath183 and , namely , if @xmath184 .",
    "if the latter is true , we can expect that , apart of a different power distribution along the @xmath2 axis and geometric effects at greater @xmath2 , there can be specific similarities in the behavior of open and dynamical de models .",
    "the relation between @xmath185 and @xmath180 can be studied through the equation @xmath186 , \\eqno ( 5.6)\\ ] ] whose validity indicates that de behaves as a fluid ; here @xmath187 is the sound velocity in de .",
    "this equation can be derived from the equation of motion of @xmath12 , as shown in appendix a. an order of magnitude estimate , however , tells us soon that @xmath188 ; then , the ratio between @xmath180 and the r.h.s . is @xmath189 , where @xmath117 is the scale related to @xmath134 . when @xmath190 ( before horizon crossing ) , the @xmath180 term is negligible , in comparison with the r.h.s .. for @xmath191 ( after horizon crossing ) , the contrary is true .",
    "hence , before horizon crossing , @xmath185 is essentially required to equate the r.h.s . and",
    ", therefore , the ratio @xmath192 shall exceed unity . at horizon",
    "crossing such ratio must approach unity and keep to such value as @xmath16 grows greater than @xmath117 .",
    "this point can also be numerically inspected . in fig .",
    "[ 14fig ] , the ratio @xmath193 is plotted against @xmath15 , for those @xmath134 values which yield the top contribution to the @xmath2 harmonics indicated in the figure , in the case of a rp model .",
    "clearly , about horizon crossing , @xmath180 is already quite close to @xmath194 .    the main differences between open and dynamical de models , in the r.h.s .",
    "( 5.5 ) are therefore relegated to times before horizon crossing .",
    "afterwards , the residual difference is due to a factor @xmath195 . if @xmath17 is too close to @xmath196 , however , such factor risks to spoil the similarities noticed hereabove .",
    "the changes in @xmath197 directly act on @xmath198 .",
    "the equation fulfilled by this spectral component reads : @xmath199    + { k \\over 5 } [ 2\\ , f_1(k , t ) - 3 f_3(k , t ) ] + \\]]@xmath200 in flat models , while in open models we have : 0.2truecm @xmath201   + { \\beta \\over 5 } [ 2 b_2\\ , f_1(\\beta , t ) - 3 b_3 f_3(\\beta , t ) ] + \\]]@xmath202 let us recall that @xmath198 is the only term of @xmath203 where anisotropy contributes .",
    "such contribution is therefore directly affected by a change in the equation of the gravitational field , which describes the isw effect in the synchronous gauge and can be similar in open models and in models with dynamical de , provided that @xmath17 is not too far from -1/3 .",
    "accordingly , when open models show negative te correlations at low @xmath2 , we can expect the same to occur in flat rp models . on the contrary , sugra models , which grant a cosmic acceleration much closer to @xmath0cdm models , due to a @xmath17 value not too far from -1 ,",
    "should not be expected to give negative te correlation and can not be tested in the same way as rp models .",
    "in this paper we showed that a particular class of dynamical de models can be fairly safely _ falsified _ using large angle cmb polarization data .",
    "models with de due to a scalar field , self  interacting through a rp potential , belong to such class . in general , however , we expect that any model with dynamical de , yielding @xmath204 or just slightly smaller , can be tested through similar data .",
    "our treatment provides quantitative predictions for the case of rp potentials , with the simplest possible reionization history yielding @xmath103 or 0.16 .",
    "if the reionization history was more complicated , as is however likely , quantitative conclusions do not apply and is hard to parametrize the whole functional parameter space , providing precise predictions .",
    "an analysis of @xmath1 correlation spectra , however , shows that negative values are a generic feature , at low @xmath2 , for most reionization histories .",
    "accordingly , in the absence of such negative signal , a rp model is however disfavored .",
    "an experiment to detect cmb polarization with a resolution of @xmath205 and @xmath206k is fully realistic . with such noise",
    ", there is a substantial fraction of realizations of a rp model with @xmath207gev , with @xmath208 , which can be distinguished from @xmath0cdm at the 3@xmath59 level .",
    "accordingly , the data analysis of a polarization experiment , with a noise level of @xmath209k , has , at least , @xmath210 of probability to indicate that the model is rp , if this is true . at the 2@xmath59 level , such model",
    "could be confused with @xmath0cdm only in quite a small fraction of realizations .",
    "the only planned polarization experiment specifically aiming to large angle polarization data is sport .",
    "the noise level that sport now expects is not much more than 1@xmath81k per pixel .",
    "other experiments , planned to provide data with greater resolution , can also provide large  angle harmonics .",
    "for instance , the wmap satellite , although not built to minimize systematic effects on polarization , can be able to provide polarization data with a noise level just slightly worse than sport , so allowing an earlier test of rp models . finally , with the sensitivity expected for planck , rp and similar models can be surely tested .    in order to determine the energy scale @xmath0 for rp potentials or to distinguish between @xmath0cdm from other de potentials , using large angular scale data , a pixel noise even below 0.1@xmath81k",
    "is apparently required .",
    "no planned polarization experiment will achieve such noise level soon and we can expect that an insight on the shape of de potentials can come earlier from different kinds of experiments .",
    "after submission of this paper and during its revision following the referee report , the first release of wmap data occurred .",
    "this suggests to add some further comments .",
    "apparently wmap data give no indication of @xmath66 being negative .",
    "the three procedures , used to estimate it , all yield large @xmath66 values at low @xmath2 and @xmath211 , for @xmath0cdm models and a single reionization .",
    "one of the above procedures explicitly assumes that a fair approximation to the true model can be found among @xmath0cdm models , trying to fix @xmath0cdm parameters best fitting data .",
    "the @xmath66 spectrum was also related its fourier transform , and then determined with a third procedure claimed to be fully model  independent .    here",
    "we wish to outline that the first procedure is unsuited to exclude rp models .",
    "following the pattern of sec .",
    "5 , we created a set of artificial skies for rp models with @xmath104gev and @xmath91gev and @xmath99 .",
    "we applied the maximum likelihood procedure to these data and fit cosmological parameters , _ assuming that the true model is _ @xmath0cdm . for the sake of example , in fig .",
    "[ ll3fig ] we show the likelihood distribution on @xmath212 , for a rp model with @xmath104gev .",
    "the procedure , being unable to explore a fair class of models , systematically overestimates @xmath29 ; if the noise is @xmath213k , the likelihood distribution is significantly non - gaussian .",
    "when noise is reduced , the likelihood distribution is more gaussian , but still peaks at high @xmath29 .",
    "then , for @xmath214k , the gaussian becomes very narrow and the fair @xmath29 value lies at more than 3@xmath59 from the best fitting @xmath29 .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath215gev .    in fig .",
    "[ cxlfig ] , we make use of this latter model to compare the rp spectrum used to create data , with the best  fit @xmath0cdm spectrum .",
    "the continuous line connects the @xmath216 values of the rp model ; the long  dashed line yields the @xmath216 values for a @xmath0cdm model with the right @xmath29 ; the short  dashed connects the @xmath216 values for the best ",
    "fit @xmath0cdm model , with 1@xmath59 error  bars .",
    "the shaded area shows the range of the cosmic variance .    for the sake of comparison , figs .",
    "[ llsufig ] and [ cxlsufig ] are analogous to figs .",
    "[ ll3fig ] and [ cxlfig ] , but for a sugra model . in the absence of the peculiar negative behavior , characterizing the rp case , no misleading effect is present .    with the reserves that these tests suggest , and relying on the _ model independent _",
    "@xmath216 deduction procedure , we however conclude that wmap apparently excludes that de is due to a scalar field , self  interacting through a rp potential with @xmath21710@xmath88gev .",
