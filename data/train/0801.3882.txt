    "the study of nuclear structure and dynamics under extreme conditions of internal energy and angular momentum is important in understanding the diverse properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "the measurements of high energy gamma rays emitted when isovector giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) in highly excited nuclei are damped can provide information on the various nuclear properties at finite temperature ( t ) and angular momentum ( j )  @xcite .",
    "although the excited state gdr in heavy ion fusion reactions was observed in the early eighties , the study of this resonance still continues to be a very interesting and useful tool in the field of nuclear structure and dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the systematics of gdr width ( @xmath4 ) as a function of t and j still remains a hotly debated and puzzling topic .",
    "the central issue is to understand the role of different damping mechanisms viz .",
    "collisional damping  @xcite and adiabatic thermal shape fluctuation  @xcite with their dependence on t and rotational frequency of the nucleus .",
    "till now most of the measurements of gdr cross - section built on excited states have been made with sn and near - sn nuclei formed by heavy ion fusion reactions .",
    "previous measurements  @xcite suggest the continuous growth of gdr width with excitation energy ( @xmath8 ) up to 120 - 130 mev ( t @xmath9 2 mev ) and attribute the same to rapid increase of spin - induced deformations and thermal shape fluctuations . as per the experimental observations , beyond the bombarding energy at which angular momentum saturates ,",
    "the increase in gdr width is very small .",
    "this saturation of width is interpreted as the evidence for the onset of maximum angular momentum the nucleus can sustain without fissioning .",
    "theoretically , the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) , in general , can predict the trend of the experimental data for @xmath10 120 - 130 mev but after that it fails to show any saturation of gdr width with increasing e@xmath7 . on the contrary , the effect of temperature on gdr width , as is revealed from the work of kelly et al .",
    "@xcite is quite inconsistent with the saturation previously observed .",
    "kelly et al . emphasized that at higher bombarding energies the excitation energy and temperature should be correctly redefined .",
    "their work results in a very interesting observation that if nuclear temperature is estimated using average e@xmath7 after proper pre - equilibrium corrections , previous results could also indicate the increase of gdr width up to t @xmath9 3.5 mev ( unlike up to 2 mev as previoulsy observed ) .",
    "the general trend of those experimental data agrees well with the predictions of the tsfm . in spite of that , some recent observations , in the region t @xmath9 2 mev , show that the experimental findings of gdr width are smaller than the predictions of tsfm in at least 4 different mass regions ( cu , sn , pb , au )  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the study of angular momentum dependence of @xmath4 keeping @xmath8 unchanged has become more controversial .",
    "previous experimental findings agree with the fact that @xmath4 remains constant up to j @xmath11 30 - 40@xmath5 which is in conformity with kusnezov parametrization of tsfm .",
    "however , at higher j values a few recent results seem to violate this parametrization . in the region",
    "t @xmath9 2 mev and with higher angular momenta , the tsfm can explain the variation of @xmath4 in the case of @xmath12sn and @xmath13w  @xcite but fails for @xmath14mo to do so  @xcite .",
    "the recent investigation by chakrabarty  @xcite emphasizes that the average values of temperature , angular momentum and mass must be smaller than those of the initial compound nucleus considered .",
    "interestingly , if the average values of those parameters are taken into account , kusnezov parametrization can successfully explain the experimental data of @xmath14mo but it fails in the case of sn  @xcite .",
    "thus though the model of thermal shape fluctuation describes rather well , on the average , many experimental results , it fails to reproduce the data corresponding to the lowest temperatures and highest spins .    under these circumstances",
    ", it comes out to be that plenty of experimental data are needed in the region of t @xmath9 2 mev with higher angular momenta to understand the limits of the tsfm and kusnezov parametrization .",
    "the present experiment revisits excited state gdr in @xmath1sb - a near sn nuclide , to provide new results at higher spins ( in the region of 40 - 60 @xmath5 ) in order to test the simple parametrization given by kusnezov , which is based on , mainly , the data at low and medium spins .",
    "the values of e@xmath7 , j and mass ( a ) have been estimated by averaging over the decay steps of the compound nucleus . in this work",
    "an effort is made to provide the temperature of the emitting nucleus applying all the necessary corrections including that of the pre - equilibrium emission .",
    "the pre - equilibrium corrections have been done using the parametrization of kelly et al .  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the variable energy cyclotron centre ( vecc ) , kolkata . a 1 mg/@xmath15 thick target of 99.9% pure @xmath3nb",
    "was bombarded with a beam of @xmath2ne produced by the k130 cyclotron of vecc .",
    "two different beam energies of 145 mev and 160 mev were employed forming the compound nucleus @xmath1sb at the excitation energies of 109 mev and 122 mev respectively .",
    "the maximum populated angular momenta for fusion were 67@xmath5 and 73@xmath5 respectively at the two bombarding energies .",

    "the array subtended a solid angle of 0.227 sr ( 1.8% of 4@xmath18 ) .",
    "lead sheets of 3 mm thickness were placed in front and sides of the array to cut down the low energy @xmath0-rays and x - rays .",
    "the beam dump was heavily shielded with borated paraffin and lead bricks to decrease the neutron and @xmath0-ray background .",

    "a dedicated electronics setup ( consisting of multi - inputs camac and nim modules and a vme based data acquisition system capable of handling @xmath11 4k events / second without appreciable dead - time loss ) was used to register the energy and time from each detector in an event by event mode .",
    "an event was treated as a valid event only when the deposited energy in any detector crosses a high threshold ( t@xmath24 ) of 4 mev .",

    "the high energy @xmath0-ray spectra were generated from the event - by - event data during offline analysis . for reconstructing the events , a nearest neighbor ( cluster ) summing technique was adopted . in this technique , first , the detector with highest energy deposited above a high threshold ( @xmath26 4 mev ) within the array was identified and named as primary detector . for obtaining the full energy information of the incident photons ,",
    "it is important to confine the secondary electromagnetic shower within the array volume as far as possible .",
    "therefore , in the above - mentioned event reconstruction technique a checking was done to find whether the primary detector was surrounded by all its neighbors i.e. , all the 8 elements ( irrespective of any hits in them ) .",
    "the event was treated as valid , if this condition was satisfied .",
    "otherwise , due to the possibility of losing a part of the electromagnetic shower , the event was rejected . in the case of a valid event , for the final adding back ,",
    "only those detectors were considered among the 8 nearest neighbors , having an energy deposit @xmath27 250 kev .",
    "the same scheme had been adopted while simulating the response of the array using geant . during the adding back ,",
    "the hit events in the individual elements in the cluster were validated by the prompt gamma cuts in tof spectra and long - short psd selections .",
    "next by gating on different coincidence folds of low energy @xmath0-multiplicities in the multiplicity array the high energy @xmath0-ray spectra were generated for each beam energy .",
    "the contributions due to the chance coincidence events within the prompt @xmath0 window in the tof spectrum were also subtracted . finally the spectra were doppler corrected .",
    "the conversion between the measured coincidence fold @xmath28 ( the number of measured coincident @xmath0-rays of low energy in each event ) to the multiplicity @xmath29 ( the number of @xmath0-rays emitted in the reaction ) was established using the response matrix @xmath30 .",
    "this response matrix was generated by making use of the geant , where , realistic multiplicity detector setup was considered and low energy @xmath0-rays were thrown isotropically with incident multiplicity distribution p(m ) . it has been assumed that the multiplicity distribution following fusion reaction is given by  @xcite ,    p(m ) = m@xmath31 $ ]    the maximum of multiplicity m@xmath32 and diffuseness @xmath33 m were obtained by fitting the equation ,    @xmath34    where f@xmath35 is the measured multiplicity spectrum in the region 2 @xmath9 f@xmath367 .",

    "[ corr ] against the @xmath0-ray energies corresponding to different folds for 160 mev incident energy .",
    "the corrections decreased as a function of fold and became negligibly small for fold f @xmath26 4 .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-ray spectra corresponding to selected folds were multiplied ( in the region below 12 mev ) by the energy dependent correction factors and corrected accordingly . the fig .",
    "[ figcor ] shows a typical high energy @xmath0-ray spectrum ( for fold = 2 at 160 mev projectile energy ) thus corrected ( filled circles ) along with the raw uncorrected one ( open circles ) .",
    "the measured enhanced yield at low folds could be due to non - fusion events .",
    "since the reaction studied has an asymmetry between n / z of the target and projectile , there might be a possibility of pre - equilibrium @xmath0-ray emissions as those are related to the dynamic dipole formation in the fusion entrance channel .",
    "however , since the recoiling nucleus was not directly measured it is not possible to disentangle the different effects .    from the multiplicity distributions for different folds , the angular momentum ( j ) distributions of the compound nucleus have been extracted and the average value of j ( j@xmath41 ) for the compound nucleus was calculated . the conversion from multiplicity to angular momentum",

    "[ figr ] , reduced gdr widths are plotted for this experiment as well as for the other set of existing data .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the global phenomenological free energy surface calculation shown in  @xcite at t = 1.8 mev within the tsfm .",
    "reduced gdr widths @xmath45 for this experiment are shown in the figure by filled circles and the data for bracco et al .",
    "are shown by open circles .",
    "those reduced gdr widths are calculated using the parametrization , @xmath46 and plotted against @xmath47 , where t@xmath32 = 1 mev and ground state gdr width @xmath48 = 3.8 mev .",
    "although the simple parametrization proposed by kusnezov reproduces reasonably well the trend of the experimental findings as a function of spin , it would be interesting to see whether the more detailed calculation with the thermal shape fluctuation model for specific nuclei can improve further the agreement with the data in reduced width plot for higher spins .",
    "the gdr width built on excited states of @xmath1sb has been studied in the interval j = 40 - 60@xmath5 and at a temperature ranging from t = 1.7 - 2.0 mev using a part of the lambda array . to decouple the effect of t and j from each other on gdr width , multiplicity detector assembly has been used .",
    "the angular momentum information was obtained from the low energy @xmath0-multiplicity filter .",
    "pre - equilibrium corrections on the excitation energies were performed .",
    "the temperature has been found from the average values of corrected excitation energy and angular momentum which provided a more stringent test for the existing tsfm for explaining the systematics of gdr width .",
    "another set of existing data from earlier measurement of gdr width of sn nuclei have been used for comparison . in spite of the fact that the simple parametrization of kusnezov describes the trend well , there remains a scope of detail tsfm calculation for further improvement in the parametrization of gdr width with j. keeping j constant , the increase of @xmath4 with t , for t @xmath9 2.0 mev , is well understood by tsfm although the matching improves to some extent by the addition of cn decay width .",
    "so for a complete understanding of thermal shape fluctuation and parametrization of gdr width , more experiments in this mass range are needed .",
    "also in the higher temperature region it is important to find out the detail pre - equilibrium energy loss involved .",
