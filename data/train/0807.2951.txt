    "in recent years , a renewed attention has been focused on higgsless models @xcite .",
    "they emerge naturally from local gauge theories in five dimensions , and their major outcome is delaying the unitarity violation of vector - boson scattering ( vbs ) amplitudes to high energies by the exchange of kaluza - klein excitations @xcite . their common drawback is to reconcile unitarity with the electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) bounds .    within this framework , and in the attempt to solve this dichotomy , many models have been proposed .",
    "we concentrate on the so called deconstructed theories @xcite which come out from the discretization of the fifth dimension to a lattice , and are described by chiral lagrangians with a number of gauge - group replicas equal to the number of lattice sites .",
    "the simplest version of this class of models is related to the old bess model @xcite , a lattice with only three sites and @xmath2 gauge symmetry ( for it , sometimes called three - site higgsless model ) . in view of the lhc experiments ,",
    "its phenomenological consequences have recently received a renewed attention .",
    "the investigated extra - gauge - boson production channels require however high luminosity to be detected . in order to reconcile unitarity and ewpt - bounds ,",
    "this minimal version predicts indeed the new triplet of vector bosons to be almost fermiophobic .",
    "hence , only di - boson channels , vector boson fusion and triple gauge boson production processes have been analysed @xcite .",
    "we extend the minimal model by inserting an additional lattice site .",
    "this new four - site higgsless model @xcite , based on the @xmath3 gauge symmetry , predicts four charged and two neutral extra gauge bosons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and satisfies the ewpt bounds without forcing the new resonances to be fermiophobic . as a consequence",

    "these are related to the two direct couplings between @xmath10-bosons ( @xmath11 ) and sm fermions and the two @xmath10 masses ( charged and neutral gauge bosons are degenerate ) , respectively .",
    "the introduction of @xmath12 represents the novelty of the proposed model .",
    "it allows to reconcile unitarity and ewpt bounds , leaving a calculable and not fine - tuned parameter space .",
    "the energy range , where the perturbative regime is still valid is plotted in fig.1l for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "owing to the exchange of the extra gauge bosons , the unitarity violation can be delayed up to an energy scale of about @xmath14 tev .",
    "hence , the mass spectrum of the new particles is constrained to be within a few tev .    in the literature , the only way to combine the need of relatively low mass extra gauge bosons with ewpt was to impose the new particles to be fermiophobic . in the four - site higgsless model , this strong assumption is not necessary anymore . in fig.1r , we plot the bounds on the charged fermion - boson couplings from the ewpt expressed in terms of the @xmath15 parameters .",
    "the outcome is that @xmath6 constraints the relation between the two couplings , while @xmath5 limits their magnitude .",
    "neutral couplings share a similar behaviour .",
    "the allowed fermion - boson couplings are thus bounded , but still sizeable .",

    "we compute the full drell - yan process , considering signal and sm - background , at ew and qcd leading order . a luminosity l=10 fb@xmath19 is assumed .    in fig .",
    "2 , we analyse both charged and neutral drell - yan channels . from top to bottom , the three curves represent the first setup , the latter and the sm prediction . in fig .",
    "2l , we plot the number of events in a 10-gev bin as a function of the leptonic transvers mass , @xmath28 , for the process @xmath29 .",

    "the number of signal ( total ) events in the range @xmath31 for the neutral channel is given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the first setup .",
    "the results show that , while the second setup would need high luminosity , in the first one the new gauge bosons could be discovered already at the lhc start - up , with a minimum luminosity l=1fb@xmath19 .",
    "the four - site higgsless model is calculable and not fined - tuned .",
    "it predicts the existence of six extra gauge bosons , @xmath16 and @xmath1 , which can have sizeable couplings to fermions .",
