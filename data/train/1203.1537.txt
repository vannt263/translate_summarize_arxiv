    "a central concern of quantum information theory is to determine the maximum amount of information that can be shared between two quantum systems .",
    "the shared information gives an indication of the quantum correlations and is thus of fundamental interest @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , knowledge of the shared information determines the performance of quantum communications @xcite and is vital for many proposed applications of quantum information @xcite .",
    "one important example of this is in quantum key distribution which , in one of the seminal insights within the field of quantum information , was the realisation that quantum mechanics allows for the secure distribution of cryptographic keys @xcite . an important class of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme are those that use entanglement @xcite .",
    "the security of entanglement based qkd is based on the nonlocality of quantum mechanics .",
    "an important issue to address for qkd is determining how many bits of secret key are distributed .",
    "a prerequisite for this calculation is determining the maximum number of unsecured bits that the two parties can share .",
    "this is the information contained in the raw keys . to fully extract this information ,",
    "error correction is necessary , followed by privacy amplification to minimise the information an eavesdropper might have access to @xcite .",
    "if one is looking to optimise both the error correction and privacy amplification protocols , then it is essential to know the mutual information shared between the raw keys",
    ". this quantity will depend on both the detectors and the details of the source of the entangled states .",
    "realistic physical models of each of these components is thus vital .",
    "the effects of losses , inefficiencies and imperfect sources have been studied previously @xcite . in particular ,",
    "spontaneous parametric down conversion sources with losses have been studied with regards to qkd @xcite .",
    "the existing work , however , has concentrated on the case where the information is encoded in the polarisation degree of freedom . as a result , this work can not be applied to communications protocols that use high dimensional entangled states with the aim of encoding multiple bits on each photon .    in this paper",
    "we determine the maximum shared information for realistic quantum sources and detectors . as most experimental implementations of quantum communication protocols",
    "are optically based , the examples we study will be limited to optical systems . the natural question to ask is : what is the maximum shared information per photon ?",
    "the main result of our paper will be to determine this for general but experimentally relevant conditions .",
    "this result is broader in its scope than earlier findings , such as @xcite .",
    "in particular , our results apply not only to information encoded in polarization , but also to information encoded in high dimensional entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "this fact is illustrated by applying our findings to different experimental setups , which include , but are not limited to , qkd experiments .",
    "our results can thus be used to optimise a given experimental procedure . in particular",
    ", one can determine the power at which to operate a pump laser driving a spontaneous parametric down conversion source , so as to maximise the mutual information .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general communication system that we consider .",
    "special attention is paid to time bin encoded communication protocols @xcite . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we construct simple mathematical models of the source , channels and imperfect photon detectors .",
    "the mutual information is calculated in section 5 and 6 for sources that produce entangled pairs with a poissonian distribution . in section 7",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results to other tasks such as characterizing the capacity of a fibre array and information theoretic approaches to quantifying entanglement .",
    "finally , our results are discussed in section 8 .",
    "the fundamental communications problem is distributing a shared string of bits between two parties , called alice and bob .",
    "one way of using quantum mechanics to achieve this is to use an entangled state , i.e. one of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "it can also be useful to consider hyper - entangled states that have entanglement between multiple degrees of freedom @xcite . a string of bits",
    "can then be generated from the correlation between one of the entangled degrees of freedom .",
    "if one is looking to communicate multiple bits per entangled state , then this requires high dimensional entanglement .",
    "the idea is best illustrated by some simple examples .",
    "using spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) one can produce pairs of photons that are entangled both in their polarization and in time / frequency @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to express such states using continuous time creation and annihilation operators , which satisfy the commutator relation @xmath2=\\delta(t - t')$ ] @xcite .",
    "the down converted state thus has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively denote horizontal and vertical polarization , @xmath6 is the creation operator for alice / bob s photons and @xmath7 is a normalized function that is zero when @xmath8 become sufficiently large .",
    "this means that if alice detects a photon at time @xmath9 , then bob should also detect his photon at a time close to @xmath9 .",
    "this correlation can be used to form a random bit string shared between alice and bob .",
    "one way of doing this is to divide the photon s possible arrival times into discrete time bins and record whether photons are found in each time bin .",
    "the measurement record of @xmath10 time bins can then be used , at least in principle , to construct a string of @xmath10 bits .",
    "the zeros and ones of the bit string would respectively correspond to the absence or detection of photons within a time bin .",
    "a second example is to use the spatial modes of entangled photons generated by spdc .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that the down converted photons are entangled in their orbital angular momentum and angular position @xcite .",
    "the fact that angular momentum requires an unbounded hilbert space means that measuring the angular momentum of the photons enables multiple bits to be extracted per photon pair .",
    "for example , if an experiment can distinguish between @xmath10 different angular momentum eigenstates , then one can extract up to @xmath11 bits per photon pair .",
    "it is worthwhile noting the connection between this communication problem and qkd . for a given quantum key distribution protocol ,",
    "one wishes to distribute a _ secret _ shared string of bits .",
    "this requires us to outline a mechanism for checking the security of the bits .",
    "a common approach is to measure in two mutually unbiased bases and then publish a random sample of alice and bob s measurement results .",
    "the presence of an eavesdropper can then be established by looking at the cases where alice and bob measured in the same basis . in the absence of an eavesdropper , these measurement results should be correlated .",
    "the use of incompatible bases and implementing security checks necessarily reduces the communication rate .",
    "the communication problem we are studying corresponds to determining the shared information when alice and bob both measure in the same basis .",
    "it is important to note that this is not the number of shared secret bits . to determine",
    "this one would need to find out the number of bits lost due to the additional constraints of security .",
    "for details on how the security of qkd decreases the shared information see @xcite .",
    "the first part of the system that we will look at is the source of the entangled photons .",
    "we first assume that the source generates entangled pairs of photons .",
    "if four photons are generated , then this will correspond to two pairs of entangled photons .",
    "the next assumption is we have a probability @xmath12 of producing @xmath13 photon pairs at a time and that this is independent of the number of photon pairs produced earlier .",
    "for the example of time bin encoded photons , @xmath12 corresponds to the probability of producing @xmath13 photon pairs within a given time window .",
    "when the photons are generated by spdc , @xmath12 can be approximated by a poissonian distribution @xcite .",
    "the next aspect that we consider is the measurement process .",
    "we consider only measurements that are realised either by the detection of photons within time bins or within discrete spatial locations or modes .",
    "this does not limit us , however , to considering only temporal or spatial encoded information .",
    "the reason for this is that measurements of other degrees of freedom can be converted into measurements of either temporal or spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "a common example of this is measuring polarization by using a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "this converts information about the polarization into information about the spatial location of a photon .",
    "similarly , one can convert measurements of different quantities into measurements of the time of arrival of a photon .",
    "for example , the spatial position of photons in an optical field have been measured using a time multiplexing fibre array . different position at which the photon could be found where converted into different time windows in which the photon could be detected @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this sort of experimental procedure is that only one photon detector is required to detect many different spatial modes .",
    "another assumption of our analysis is that one is equally likely to obtain any of the measurement outcomes .",
    "for example , in a time - binned system this would correspond to it being equally likely that photons are sent in each time bin . while the assumption is reasonable in the context of time - binned communication systems",
    ", it can appear prohibitive in other situations .",
    "the reason for making this assumption is that the aim of our analysis is to determine the effect of inefficiencies in the source , channel and detectors .",
    "for this reason we consider only the simplest possible form for the entangled photonic states .",
    "more complex systems can , however , still be approximated by our analysis .",
    "for example , the effective schmidt modes of an spdc state with large schmidt number can , to a good approximation , be taken to be equiprobable @xcite .",
    "as our aim is to encode information on each photon pair and not in the number of photons , we shall consider only threshold detectors that do not resolve photon number .",
    "consider first the situation where we have no losses .",
    "this would correspond to no transmission losses and ideal detectors that detect all photons incident on them .",
    "the probability for alice or bob s detector to fire is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability for the ideal detector to click and @xmath12 is again the probability to find @xmath13 photons within each time bin or spacial mode . in a real experiment , however , detectors do have losses .",
    "one can model an inefficient detector as an ideal detector with a lossy medium in front of it @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", the lossy medium can be viewed as a beam splitter with transmission coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "the losses will thus correspond to photons being reflected at the beam splitter .",
    "the square of the transmission coefficient , @xmath17 , corresponds to the efficiency of the detector .",
    "it is clear that a single photon incident on the nonideal detector will be detected with probability @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the photons lost by the detectors there will be losses during transmission .",
    "this can again be modelled by a beam splitter , where the transmission coefficient is @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to incorporate both of these sources of losses into a single efficiency for the system .",
    "this would correspond to a beam splitter with transmission coefficient @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the total efficiency @xmath21 again gives the probability for any given emitted photon to be detected .",
    "one further source of loss is in cross talk between multiple modes .",
    "this would be an issue if one is transmitting the information in spatial modes .",
    "the effect of cross talk is to cause photons to be lost from one mode and appear in a different one .",
    "a simple way to account for this in our current model is to adjust the efficiency @xmath21 to include loss from cross talk .",
    "the effect of the photons appearing in a different mode can then be dealt with by increasing the effective dark count rate .",
    "to calculate the mutual information we need to determine the joint probability for alice and bob to obtain the same measurement outcome .",
    "the key mathematical tool in our analysis is the moment generating function @xcite .",
    "if @xmath22 is the probability that a pulse contains @xmath23 photons , then we define the moment generating function to be @xmath24 moment generating functions have many useful properties , the simplest of which is @xmath25 it is straightforward to generalize the definition of @xmath26 to a pair of pulses : @xmath27 in our case the pair of pulses correspond to the entangled signal and idler beams for a single time bin or spatial mode .",
    "the number of photons in each pulse is the same , hence @xmath28 the merit of using the moment generating functions is that it is easy to account for losses @xcite .",
    "if we suppose that alice and bob both have identical detectors and that both their channels have the same losses , then we can assign to both parties the same total efficiency @xmath21 .",
    "the generating function is @xmath29 consider a particular measurement outcome .",
    "this will either correspond to a spatial location at which photons can be detected or a particular time bin in which the photons can be found .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the detectors registering a click and not registering a click , respectively .",
    "the joint probability for alice and bob to both get the same measurement outcome is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . in the ideal case @xmath34 , i.e. alice and bob would either both detect photons or neither would detect any . this is not the case , however , when losses are present . in the absence of dark",
    "counts the probabilities are @xmath35 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effect of the detectors registering dark counts can easily be modelled .",
    "let @xmath36 be the probability that , within a given period of time , alice or bob s detector fires when no photons are incident on it .",
    "the joint probability , @xmath37 , will thus be @xmath38 it is straightforward to verify that these probabilities sum to one .",
    "the marginal probabilities for alice or bob s detector to fire are @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 .",
    "we have thus obtain a general expression for the joint and marginal probability distributions .",
    "these expressions are valid for any choice for the source probability @xmath12 and consequently are not tied to one physical implementation .",
    "in the classic paper of shannon it was shown that the maximum amount of information that two parties can share is given by the mutual information @xcite . for a joint probability distribution @xmath37 with marginal probabilities",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 , the mutual information is defined as @xmath43 the quantity given in equation ( [ hab ] ) is the mutual information that alice and bob share when they obtain the same measurement outcome . consider a time bin encoded qkd protocol . if @xmath10 time bins are used to create a key , then alice and bob will share a bit string of length @xmath44 .",
    "when one is interested in qkd , then number of shared bits will , of course , be reduced by the need to perform privacy amplification .    for communication in the quantum regime ,",
    "it often important to know the number of shared bits per photon .",
    "we must , however , be careful in how this quantity is defined .",
    "one approach would be to divide the mutual information by the mean number of photon pairs produced .",
    "if we denote the mean number of photon pairs by @xmath45 , then the information per photon is simply @xmath46 the quantity @xmath47 is the information per generated photon pair , however , not all generated photons are detected .",
    "this fact suggests an alternative way to define the information per photon . instead of considering the information per generated photon pair",
    ", we can use the information per detected photon pair .",
    "this is defined as @xmath48    the formalism developed so far applies to any choice for @xmath12 .",
    "we shall examine a concrete example , where @xmath12 is a poissonian distribution .",
    "an important way of generating entangled photons is via the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) . in this approach",
    "a pump beam illuminates a nonlinear crystal . within the crystal",
    ", each pump photon can be converted into two lower frequency photons , referred to as signal and idler photons . by careful choice of the systems parameters",
    ", one can arrange for the emitted photon pairs to be entangled .",
    "this entanglement can be both in the polarisation and in the transverse spatial modes @xcite .",
    "this method of generating entangled photons has been used in many experimental realisations of qkd @xcite .    to illustrate how spdc can be used to distribute a string of random bits consider the following two examples .",
    "a time - binned protocol can be implemented using a pulsed laser that is shone at a nonlinear crystal .",
    "the resulting down - converted photon pairs are entangled in time .",
    "distributing these photons to alice and bob allows them to construct a shared random string of bits .",
    "the entangled time bin states needed for this protocol have already been experimentally generated @xcite .",
    "the second example is to use the spatial modes of photons generated by spdc . by using a pump beam with an appropriate profile @xcite",
    ", one can generate photon pairs that carry angular momentum in their transverse modes @xcite .",
    "the down converted photons will be entangled in the angular momentum degree of freedom .",
    "a mode sorter can be used to separate some of the different angular momentum states into different spatial locations , where photon detectors are located . in the limit of large schmidt number , the effective modes of the photon pairs",
    ", will be approximately equiprobably @xcite .",
    "the analysis we present will apply to both of these examples as well as many other situations where photons are generated by spdc .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath13 pairs of photons to be generated by spdc can be approximated by a poissonian distribution @xmath49 it can easily be verified that @xmath45 is the mean number of photon pairs . using this distribution",
    "we can derive the mutual information for qkd schemes that use spdc to generate pairs of entangled photons .",
    "the use of a poissonian for the probability distribution is only valid when the initial laser pulses are not too short .",

    ", @xmath60 would be one bit . from figure [ h1 ]",
    "we see that inefficiencies can significantly decrease the mutual information .",
    "it is thus important to maximise the possible mutual information by controlling the value of @xmath45 .",
    "the optimal value for @xmath45 can be found using equation ( [ mutin ] ) .    .",
    "[ h1 ]    in order to compare different experimental qkd schemes it is often useful to determine the number of bits per photon .",
    "equation ( [ igen ] ) gives the number of bits per generated photon , while equation ( [ idet ] ) gives the number of bits per detected photon .",
    "the mutual information per generated photon , @xmath61 , is plotted in figure 2 as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows that for an efficiency of 0.85 , we can have greater than 10 bits per generated photon .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows that with a lower dark count and efficiency of 0.8 , one can achieve more than 13 bits per generated photon .",

    "the result ( [ mutin ] ) can be used with equations ( [ igen ] ) and ( [ idet ] ) to find the value of @xmath45 that maximizes the information per photon . from the perspective of experimentally implementing high bit rate qkd",
    ", one might wish to determine the laser intensity that optimizes the number of bits per photon .",
    "this task can be achieved using our results together with the fact that the value of @xmath45 will depend on the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "this is one of the key finding of this paper .",
    "the dependence of @xmath47 and @xmath64 on the efficiency can be of practical significance for implementing qkd .",
    "for example , in an experiment one might what to know how big an improvement there would be if better detectors are used .",
    "this problem can again be solved using equation ( [ mutin ] ) .",
    "mathematically the problem is to find the maximum of @xmath47 or @xmath64 for fixed values of @xmath21 and @xmath36 .",

    "the plot is for a fixed value of @xmath36 , however , decreasing @xmath36 does not significantly increase the information .",
    "similarly , the information is not decreased by too much if @xmath36 is increased by an order of magnitude .",
    "if @xmath36 is increased by several orders of magnitude , then @xmath65 will be decreased by an noticeable amount .",
    "one thus sees that for reasonable small dark counts , the efficiency is the main factor limiting the information per photon .",
    "the theory we have outlined has , thus far , be applied to quantum communication .",
    "there are , however , other situations where these results can be applied .",
    "an example of this is in developing experimentally useful classifications of entangled states .",
    "one approach is to use the information that two parties can extract from an entangled state as a figure of how entangled the state is @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach has been used as the basis for an experimental procedure for quantifying the entanglement in photons generated by spdc @xcite .",
    "the idea was to use the fact that a pair of photons generated by spdc are entangled both in position and momentum .",
    "the results of measurements on each photons position or momentum would thus be correlated .",
    "the mutual information gained by measuring these quantities will thus give us an indication of the strength of the entanglement .",
    "if one is to make accurate comparisons between experimental results and theory , it is important to factor in effects such as detector inefficiencies , dark counts and imperfections in the source .",
    "this can be achieved using the formalism that we have developed . in particular",
    ", one can see how the experimental imperfections should affect the measured entanglement of the state .    in the experiments discussed in @xcite the measurements of position and momentum",
    "were made using spatial resolving photon detectors .",
    "these consisted of a detector with discrete pixels .",
    "detection of photons by one of the pixels would thus allow for a measurement of the spatial location of the photons .",
    "each pixel has a finite width .",
    "the measurement thus has a discrete set of outcomes .",
    "one subtle point is that if the region of space is chosen sufficiently large , then the probability for detecting photons at various locations can vary . in our analysis",
    "we implicitly assume that each outcome is equiprobable .",
    "this assumption means that applying our theory to this experiment will lead to a slight overestimate of the mutual information .",
    "this suggests that the proper way of viewing our results , when applied to this setup , is as providing an upper bound on the possible mutual information .",
    "another interesting application of our theory is in characterizing the information capacity of a fibre array .",
    "this would entail treating the array as a information channel and calculating the maximum mutual information between the outputs and input with a fixed probe beam .",
    "the capacity gives an information theoretic measure of the ability of a given array to transmit and sort optical pulses .",
    "an example of the sort of system where this could be important is in time multiplexing of detectors @xcite .",
    "the two situations we consider are @xmath10 input fibres coupled to a single detector and a single input fibre coupled to @xmath10 fibres . in the former situation",
    "we have @xmath10 inputs and one detector , while in the later we have one input and @xmath10 detectors .",
    "one crucial difference between both of these cases and all our previous examples is that we are not considering pairs of entangled photons . instead",
    ", our inputs will be pulses that contain @xmath23 photons with probability @xmath22 .",
    "in many instances the statistics of the input pulses can be approximated by a poissonian distribution .",
    "for example , if one takes each pulse to be in a coherent state @xcite .",
    "when this is the case , the capacity can be calculated using equation ( [ mutin ] ) .",
    "the approach is best illustrated by a simple example .",
    "suppose we have a fibre array composed of 8 output fibres coupled to a single detector .",
    "this situation has be experimentally realized in @xcite .",
    "the array is designed so that each fibre has a different length so that the different inputs reach the detector at different well defined times .",
    "let us assume that the separation between these time bins is 1ns , which is larger than the jitter of our detector .",
    "the efficiency of the detector and array is taken to be 40@xmath66 , while the dark count rate is 300/s .",
    "the probability of obtaining a dark count in a given time window is thus @xmath67 .",
    "finally , we assume that the input pulses have a poissonian photon distribution with mean @xmath45 and that the pulses are equally likely to enter each input . under these conditions equation ( [ mutin ] ) can be used to calculate the total information as a function of @xmath45 . in figure [ figarr ]",
    "we plot the average information per generated photon .",
    "the previous calculations were for a beam that has a poissonian photon distribution .",
    "if the beam is not poissonian or can not be approximated by a poissonian , then equation ( [ mutin ] ) can not be used . instead",
    ", one can use the general formalism outlined in section 3 .",
    "the procedure would thus be to calculate the generating function for the given choice of @xmath22 .",
    "equations ( [ piprobs ] ) and ( [ fullprobs ] ) can then be used to calculate the alice and bob s joint probability distribution .",
    "we have investigated how realistic experimental conditions affect the amount of shared information that two parties can extract from entangled photons .",
    "a key goal of our work is to investigate systems where multiple bits can be encoded on each photon .",
    "this means that our analysis goes beyond previous work , which has focused on encoding information in polarization .",
    "our approach was to construct simple but realistic models of the entangled photon source , the information channel and the detectors .",
    "these models allowed us to take account of effects such as transmission losses , cross talk , detector inefficiencies and dark counts . after developing the general theory in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "the formalism was illustrated by looking at systems where the photon pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion .",
    "an explicit expression for the mutual information , equation ( [ mutin ] ) , was given for this case .",
    "this represented one of the main results of the paper . within a qkd scheme",
    "the quantity we have calculated corresponds to the shared information in alice and bob s keys , before privacy amplification .",
    "our results can thus be used in the design of qkd experiments to choose parameters that maximise both the mutual information and the average information per photon . as an example , figure [ fig7 ] shows the optimal amount of information per photon that two parties can share as a function of the efficiency .",
    "our findings have applications out with quantum key distribution .",
    "this was demonstrated by two examples .",
    "the first was using the mutual information as a basis for an experimental protocol to quantify photonic entanglement @xcite .",
    "the second application was in characterizing the efficiency of an optical array in terms of how well it transmits information .",

    "<S> a key goal of quantum communication is to determine the maximum number of bits shared between two quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> an important example of this is in entanglement based quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes </S>",
    "<S> . a realistic treatment of this general communication problem must take account of the nonideal nature of the entanglement source and the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to give such a treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytic expression for the mutual information in terms of experimental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the results are applied to communication schemes that rely on spontaneous parametric down conversion to generate entangled photons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our results can be applied to tasks such as calculating the optimal rate of bits per photon in high dimensional time bin encoded qkd protocols ( prior to privacy amplification ) . a key finding for such protocols </S>",
    "<S> is that by using realistic experimental parameters , one can obtain over 10 bits per photon . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how our results can be applied to characterize the capacity of a fibre array and to quantify entanglement using mutual information . </S>"
