    "the behaviour of highly energetic ions in tokamak plasmas is one of the most important issues in the physics of burning plasmas@xcite , and thus of great interest for both theoretical and experimental study .",
    "alfvnic instabilities which can tap the free energy in the energetic ion distribution  @xcite are often excited in present - day tokamak experiments .",
    "this is due to the resonant interaction between shear alfvn waves and ions either accelerated by ion - cyclotron resonance heating ( icrh )  @xcite or produced by neutral beam injection ( nbi )  @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that similar alfvnic instabilities will be excited in burning plasmas such as iter by the fusion - produced alpha particles  @xcite .",
    "the destabilization of alfvn eigenmodes ( aes ) typically results in spatial redistribution ( potentially global ) of the fast particles  @xcite , which may lead to quenching the plasma burn and damaging the first wall .",
    "more recently aes have also been used for diagnostic purposes  @xcite , divulging information about the plasma interior inaccessible to other diagnostics .    in order to determine the potential effects of aes and",
    "what information they can reveal we require a complete model for both the modes and their interaction with the energetic ions . in the analytic study of energetic particle driven instabilities",
    "the focus has often been on the excitation of bulk plasma eigenmodes@xcite .",
    "there is also a lot of interest in instabilities associated with non - perturbative energetic particle modes  @xcite .",
    "we continue this progress here by developing a new analytic model for the resonant drive of shear alfvn perturbations due to icrh - accelerated ions , suitable for analyzing both classes of instabilities .",
    "the distribution of ions created by icrh - acceleration is a distribution of particles with predominantly perpendicular energy and sharply peaked in pitch angle  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of these particles is such that all the tips of the banana orbits lie on the surface where the local ion cyclotron frequency resonates with the applied rf wave . in a typical tokamak",
    "this is an approximately vertical surface , @xmath1 , and we classify the heating by where @xmath2 lies compared to the magnetic axis @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 we have high - field - side heating , @xmath5 gives low - field - side heating and @xmath6 is known as on - axis heating . in a typical discharge with icrh the flux - surface - averaged density of fast particles can be hollow for low - field - side heating , and is usually centrally peaked when there is high - field - side or on - axis heating .",
    "given the energetic particle distribution we can calculate the fast particle effect on any given mode .",

    "[ fpp ] we use these coordinates to express the linearized drift kinetic equation for the fast particles in a simple form .",
    "we then solve this equation for the fast particle response and use it to calculate the contribution that the fast particle resonance provides to the alfvn wave equations developed in sec .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of complex integrals over the unperturbed orbits , to make further progress we focus on the case of radially extended perturbations , for which @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the minor radius of the plasma and @xmath10 is the poloidal mode number ) .",
    "this approximation is valid for high-@xmath0 alfvnic perturbations if the magnetic shear is sufficiently low over a substantial fraction of the minor radius .",
    "the radial structure of the mode is known to be sensitive to the radial variation of the @xmath11-profile .",
    "the alfvn frequency variation is itself controlled by the @xmath11-profile variation which is amplified by the large mode number . thus if the low shear region extends for multiple poloidal wavelengths the relation in eq .",

    "this assumption and the thin orbit approximation imply the mode is much broader than the orbit width , which alllows us to average over a radial distance wider than an orbit width yet smaller than the mode width .",
    "the sheared magnetic field configuration leads to the result that the energetic particles experience different phases of the mode at different radii along their orbit ; as these differences are multiplied by the large mode number @xmath0 they lead to highly oscillatory contributions to the integrals along the energetic particle orbits .",
    "the averaging procedure described allows us to calculate the integrals along orbits in closed form by only considering the non - oscillatory contributions in the vicinity of the turning points .",

    "whilst we consider a weakly - radiatively - damped mode atop a potential hill , it is possible to construct solutions where kinetic effects provide a potential well for standing waves  @xcite via coupling to kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "we work in the same regime as ref .",
    "where @xmath200 , given as the sum of the drive and the continuum damping by eq .  ( [ growth ] ) is not vanishingly small . in this regime ,",
    "the discrete kinetic modes have a spectrum consisting of multiple eigenmodes with a frequency spacing @xmath217 given by :  @xcite @xmath218 we compare this to the damping rate @xmath219 of our longest lived mode in the limit @xmath220 , i.e. away from the lowest frequency of the cascade or for very small @xmath221 , @xmath222 thus , if the condition @xmath223 is satisfied , we expect the resulting behaviour to be well described by our continuum approximation . this is because the radiative damping is in reality due to phase mixing that arises from the many different kinetic modes that make up the initial perturbation .",
    "the discrete nature of these modes is only apparent on timescales longer than @xmath224 by which time the mode has either decayed to zero or grown beyond the applicability of linear theory . in the opposite limit , where eq .",
    "( [ discretization ] ) is violated , the results of ref .",
    "have been extended in ref .   to find a discrete kinetic mode with a broad radial scale .",
    "we now consider the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ discretization ] ) for typical experimental parameters .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ omhdef ] ) and neglecting the pressure gradient allows us to estimate @xmath168 by @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the density gradient scale length of the fast particles . for typical jet parameters ( @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 ) we find @xmath232 and @xmath233 so that the continuum - like description for the mode is suitable for the problem under consideration . near marginal stability , i.e. for the case @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the linear drive due to resonant particles , an extra factor @xmath236 appears in eq.(94 ) , which may violate the applicability condition for the quasimode approach and a more delicate description of the discrete spectrum would be required .",
    "in relating our results to experimental data , we need to highlight the fact that the _ downward _ sweeping acs are very rare compared to _ upward _ sweeping acs .",
    "since 1997 , when magnetic spectrograms became available for every jet discharge , downward sweeping acs have been detected in only 26 discharges as opposed to more than 5000 discharges where upward sweeping acs have been observed ( magnetic probes , o - mode inteferometry  @xcite and x - mode reflectometry  @xcite contribute to this data ) . due to the scarcity of downward sweeping acs , some essential plasma diagnostics were unavailable at the time of their observation .",
    "in particular , mse measurements  @xcite of the q(r)-profile were only made in 5 discharges out of the 26 .",
    "although 26 examples of downward sweeping acs provide very limited statistics they are still indicative of why downward sweeping acs are so rare .    first , there is no obvious correlation between downward sweeping acs and the type of energetic particle population in the discharge .",
    "the downward sweeping acs were observed in discharges with nbi only ( 3 discharges ) , combined icrh and nbi ( 9 discharges ) , and icrh only ( 14 discharges ) . in the cases of plasmas with icrh , high - field side ( up to @xmath237 in discharge # 56947 , t = 3.8 s ) , low - field side ( up to @xmath238 in discharge # 65550 , t = 5.2 s ) , and on - axis icrh were used .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that downward sweeping acs require an extraordinary energetic particle distribution .",
    "second , downward sweeping acs are seen in discharges with magnetic fields ranging from 1.8 t ( discharge # 72691 ) to 3.45 t ( discharge # 46863 ) .",
    "although no measurements of ion temperature exist for most of the downward sweeping acs , the variation of the magnetic field , together with the difference in the types of heating , is likely to cause a significant spread in larmor radii across the data base . in the discharges where ion temperature was measured ,",
    "ion larmor radius is found to be about 3 mm , no different from many discharges with upward sweeping acs .",
    "we then conclude that the downward sweeping acs are unlikely to be due to some anomaly in larmor radius present in all 26 pulses of the data base .",
    "third , we investigate whether the downward sweeping acs are associated with a specific type of plasma equilibrium . with plasma currents varying from 1.1 ma ( discharge # 68822 at t = 1.95 s ) to 3.5 ma ( discharge # 46863 at t = 4.8 s ) , downward sweeping acs",
    "are observed with @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and even @xmath241 ( discharge # 68822 , t = 1.95 s ) .",
    "however , equilibrium reconstructions for the discharges where mse diagnostic data was available show that such discharges have very flat @xmath11-profiles ( see table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "we note that downward sweeping acs were never observed in jet discharges with strong shear reversal and current holes  @xcite .",
    "these discharges are typical for jet advanced scenarios and they usually exhibit very clear upward sweeping acs . one can than conjecture that downward sweeping acs require low shear values , which are quite rare in jet discharges with @xmath242 .",
    "this conjecture is consistent with what follows from eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] : shallow @xmath11-profiles ( small @xmath221 ) minimize continuum damping making it easier for the mode to be destabilized and grow to an observable level .",
    ".discharges with downward sweeping acs , for which mse measurements are available [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     toroidal mode numbers were determined from mirnov coil data for 19 discharges containing downward sweeping acs .",
    "all these numbers were positive and lie in the range @xmath243 to @xmath244 .",
    "it is noteworthy that upward sweeping acs also have only positive toroidal mode numbers  @xcite .",
    "the absence of negative toroidal mode numbers agrees with the theoretical conclusion that the corresponding modes are stable and damped .",
    "an idealized model of quiescent plasma with a population of hot icrf heated ions and a shallow ( @xmath245 ) @xmath11-profile appears to be relevant to reverse - shear discharges with downward sweeping acs . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ etadef ] ) , these modes must have positive values of @xmath194 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath194 is dominated by that of @xmath246 .",
    "we thus notionally hold all other parameters constant and examine what happens as @xmath11 ( or equivalently @xmath194 ) decreases with time . as",
    "the continuum damping decreases with @xmath194 the mode eventually becomes unstable .",
    "if the critical value of @xmath194 is above zero we expect to see a downward sweeping trace until @xmath194 reaches zero whereupon the mode becomes the geodesic acoustic mode@xcite .",
    "as @xmath194 decreases further to negative values , we expect to see an upward sweeping trace until the mode reaches the tae frequency .",
    "we now consider an example of downward - sweeping acs shown in figure  [ omode ] .",
    "figure  [ power ] shows the corresponding power waveforms for the icrh , nbi and lower - hybrid current drive ( lhcd ) systems in jet discharge # 66550 with toroidal field @xmath247 and plasma current @xmath248 .",
    "it is typical for scenarios aiming at the creation of an internal transport barrier that the inductive current drive is still ramping up ( see figure  [ power ] ) when the main heating power is applied .",
    "this creates the non - monotonic @xmath11-profile shown in figure  [ qprof ] ( reconstructed from mse data ) , with @xmath249 at @xmath250 when the mse data was taken .",
    "this profile has a broad region of very low shear ( @xmath251 in the shear - reversed region ) with @xmath252 at the shear reversal point .",

    "most of the rf power was deposited at @xmath253 .",
    "we thus expect a hollow profile of fast ions in the region @xmath254 .",
    "the ` selfo ` code  @xcite confirms this expectation , predicting a hollow profile for the fast particle energy density . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq81 ] ) , an energetic particle population with such a hollow profile and @xmath255 provides a drive for ac quasimodes making them observable .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the quasimodes discussed here do not require a potential well , which distinguishes them from the ac eigenmodes discussed in ref .  .",
    "the drive calculated here is destabilizing only for positive toroidal mode numbers , in the typical off - axis icrh scenarios .",
    "downward sweeping acs have also been observed in on - axis heated discharges . in order to apply our theory to this case",
    "we need to include a broader profile in bounce angle in our derivation .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ dpfinale ] ) to a localized distribution with finite width is fairly simple , and one can see quickly that it will be a weighted average of eq .",
    "( [ dpfinale ] ) over the range of possible bounce angles .",
    "however as @xmath171 is larger in the high field side region ( by one power of @xmath0 ) we can neglect any contrbution from the low - field - side region and conclude that , for on or near axis heating , positive @xmath0 modes are unstable if @xmath256 at the zero shear point .",
    "this agrees with experiment where , unless the zero shear point is very close to the magnetic axis , we indeed expect the profile to drop off radially ( @xmath257 ) at the zero shear point .",
    "due to the scarcity of downward sweeping modes on jet , the inability to run with hollow profiles and high - field - side irch and the scarcity of toroidal mode number data it is not possible to completely verify the predictions made after eq .",
    "( [ eq81 ] ) .",
    "however none of the experimental results on downward sweeping modes from jet contradict our predictions .",
    "in this paper we have used the action - angle formalism for the bounce - precessional motion of the fast icrh - accelerated ions to calculate the resonant response of the ions to shear alfvn perturbations without making the deeply trapped orbit approximation used previously  @xcite . by exploiting the characteristic features of alfvn eigenmodes ,",
    "we reduce the complex orbit integrals to local contributions from a few critical points .    using this local formulation of the energetic ion response",
    "we calculate the resonant ion drive for alfvn cascades ( acs ) and ac quasimodes . based on the expression for the drive , and an asymptotic expression for the radiative damping",
    ", we conclude that the ac quasimode should be observed predominantly in weakly reversed shear configurations and that , in such a configuration , it can explain downward sweeping alfvn cascades below the tae frequency .",
    "furthermore , we conclude that the quasimode should only be excited with positive mode numbers in experimentally relevant plasma configurations .",
    "we reinforce this conclusion via a comparison to experiments carried out on jet .",
    "a database of jet pulses where quasimodes were observed is compiled and examined , along with advanced equilibrium reconstruction to determine the @xmath11-profile .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate that the observation of downward sweeping alfvn cascades is indeed linked to the presence of a weakly reversed shear plasma . in the few cases where mode number information is available only positive mode numbers are excited , agreeing qualitatively with our predictions for the resonant excitation mechanism due to trapped energetic ions .    during this work i.g.a .",
