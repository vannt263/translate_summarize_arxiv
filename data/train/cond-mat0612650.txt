    "the quest for understanding phase transitions in terms of geometrical objects has a long history .",

    ", onsager @xcite made the following remark : `` as a possible interpretation of the @xmath1-point , we can understand that when the concentration of vortices reaches the point where they form a connected tangle throughout the liquid , then the liquid becomes normal . ''",
    "feynman also worked on this approach and summarized the idea as follows @xcite : `` the superfluid is pierced through and through with vortex line .",
    "we are describing the disorder of helium  i. '' this approach focuses on vortex loops , i.e. , one - dimensional geometrical objects , which form a fluctuating vortex tangle .",
    "as the critical temperature @xmath2 is approached from below , the vortex loops proliferate and thereby disorder the superfluid state , causing the system to revert to the normal state .",
    "the @xmath1 transition is thus characterized by a fundamental change in the typical vortex loop size .",
    "whereas in the superfluid phase only a few small loops are present , close to @xmath2 loops of all sizes appear .",
    "the sudden appearance of arbitrarily large geometrical objects is reminiscent of what happens in percolation phenomena at the percolation threshold where clusters proliferate .",
    "even on an infinite lattice , a percolating cluster can be found spanning the lattice .",

    ", the individual particles form separate closed loops wrapping only once around the imaginary time axis . upon lowering the temperature , these small loops , describing single particles , hook up to form larger exchange rings . a particle in such a composite ring ( see fig .  [ fig : path_labels ] ) moves in imaginary time along a trajectory that does not end at its own starting position , but ends at that of another particle .",
    "hence , although the initial and final configurations are identical , the particles in a composite ring are cyclically permuted and thus become indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : path_labels ] gives an example of three particles , labeled 1,2 , and 3 .",
    "after wrapping once around the imaginary time axis particle 1 ends at the starting position of particle 2 , which in turn ends after one turn around the imaginary time axis at the starting position of particle 3 .",
    "that particle , finally , ends at the starting position of particle 1 . in this way , the three particles are cyclically permuted , forming the cycle @xmath14 .",
    "being part of a single loop which winds three times around the imaginary time axis , the particles can not be distinguished any longer . at the critical temperature ,",
    "worldlines proliferate and  again as in percolation phenomena  loops wrapping arbitrary many times around the imaginary time axis appear , signaling the onset of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",

    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "a third example concerns the phase transition in simple magnets .",
    "the most elementary model describing such a transition is provided by the ising model , obtained by assigning a spin that can point either up or down to each lattice site .",
    "figure [ fig : ising ] shows typical spin configurations for a square lattice in the normal , hot phase and just above the curie point . for convenience , a spin up is denoted by a black square , while a spin down is denoted by a white one . from these snapshots , the relevant geometrical objects appear to be clusters of nearest neighbor spins in the same spin state ( in the following , we will qualify this statement ) .",
    "the normal , disordered phase consists of many small clusters . as the curie point @xmath15 is approached from above , larger clusters appear , which at @xmath15 start to proliferate  as in percolation phenomena . in the absence of an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the percolating cluster can consist of either up or down spins , both having equal probability to form the majority spin state .",
    "since the percolating spin clusters have a fractal structure , it is tempting to ask whether this structure encodes the standard thermodynamic critical behavior , as in percolation theory ?",
    "more generally , we wish to address in these notes the question : can suitably defined geometrical objects encode in their fractal structure the standard critical behavior of the system under consideration ? to highlight the basic features , we consider simple models , such as the ising , the potts , and the xy model .",
    "moreover , we study them mostly in two dimensions ( 2d ) since many analytical predictions , obtained by using coulomb gas methods and conformal field theory , are available there .     in the normal , hot phase at @xmath16 ( left panel ) and just above the curie point at @xmath17 ( right panel ) .",

    "the potts model is of particular interest to us as for @xmath22 it is equivalent to the ising model , while in the limit @xmath23 it describes ordinary , uncorrelated percolation .",
    "the notation @xmath24 is to indicate that the double sum over the lattice sites , labeled by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , extends over nearest neighbors only .",

    "as geometrical clusters are split up in the process , the resulting fk clusters are generally smaller and more loosely connected than the geometrical ones .    not only does the fk representation provide a geometrical description of the phase transition in the potts model , it also forms the basis of efficient monte carlo algorithms by swendsen and wang @xcite , and by wolff @xcite , in which not individual spins are updated , but entire fk clusters .",

    "fig : dis_geonc_512_2 ] shows the distribution of the hulls of geometrical clusters in the ising model at criticality .",
    "the slow approach to the asymptotic form , with the associated strong corrections to scaling we observed for the hulls of geometrical clusters , stands out clearly from the other distributions .",
    "the reason for this is that geometrical clusters have a larger extent than fk clusters . on a finite lattice ,",
    "percolating clusters gulp up smaller ones reached by crossing lattice boundaries . for geometrical clusters",
    "this happens more often than for fk clusters , so that disregarding percolating clusters when tracing out cluster boundaries has a more profound effect . in particular ,",

    "statistical error bars are omitted from the data points for clarity .",
    "the straight line is a one - parameter fit through the data points with the slope fixed to the expected value .",
    "[ fig : dis_geonc_512_2 ] ]    this behavior is different from what we found in another numerical study of the hulls of geometrical clusters in the 2d ising model @xcite . in that monte carlo study , we used a plaquette update to directly simulate the hulls . although the largest hull was omitted in each measurement , we found corrections to scaling to be virtually absent ( see fig .",
    "11 of that paper ) .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a precise estimate for the fractal dimension on relatively small lattices .",
    "as illustrated in these notes , for the 2d potts models it is well established that suitably defined geometrical objects encode in their fractal structure critical behavior . in fact , two types of spin clusters exist , viz .",
    ", fk and geometrical clusters , which both proliferate precisely at the thermal critical point . as emphasized before , this is special to 2d . in general ,",
    "geometrical clusters percolate at an inverse temperature @xmath176 .",
    "the fractal structure of fk clusters encodes the critical exponents of the critical potts model , while that of geometrical clusters in 2d encodes those of the tricritical potts model .",
    "the fractal structure of the two cluster types as well as the two fixed points are closely related , being connected by the dual map @xmath177 .",
    "this map conserves the central charge , so that both fixed points share the same central charge .",
    "the geometrical clusters can , as far as scaling properties are concerned , be considered shadows of the fk clusters .    up to now we considered external boundaries of spin clusters as clusters themselves , which necessarily percolate when the spin clusters do",
    ". an alternative way of looking at these boundaries is to consider them as loops . in this approach , it is natural to extend the ising model in another way and to consider the o(@xmath178 ) spin models , with @xmath179 .",
    "the high - temperature ( ht ) representation of the critical o(@xmath178 ) spin model naturally defines a loop gas , corresponding to a diagrammatic expansion of the partition function in terms of closed graphs along the bonds on the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "the loops percolate right at the critical temperature , and similar arguments as given in these notes for spin clusters show that the fractal structure of these geometrical objects encode important information concerning the thermal critical o(@xmath178 ) behavior @xcite .",
    "this connection was first established by de gennes @xcite for self - avoiding walks , which are described by the o(@xmath178 ) model in the limit @xmath180 .",
    "one aspect in which lines differ from spin clusters is that they can be open or closed .",
    "it is well known from the work on self - avoiding walks that the loop distribution itself is not sufficient to establish the critical behavior , as has recently also been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this , also the total number @xmath181 of _ open graphs _ of @xmath50 steps starting at @xmath182 and ending at an arbitrary site @xmath183 is needed .",
    "its asymptotic behavior close to the critical temperature , cf .",
    "( [ elln ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , @xmath184 provides an additional exponent @xmath185 , which together with the loop distribution exponents is needed to specify the full set of critical exponents @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) , @xmath61 denotes the fractal dimension of the closed graphs .",
    "note that for spin clusters , the notion of open or closed does not apply , so that the analog of the exponent @xmath185 is absent there .    remarkably , the ht graphs of a given critical o(@xmath178 ) model represent at the same time the hulls of the geometrical clusters in the @xmath19-state potts model with the same central charge @xcite . to close the circle , we note that , as in the potts model , including vacancies in the o(@xmath178 ) model gives rise to also tricritical behavior .",
    "the tricritical point corresponds to the point where the ht graphs collapse . in the context of self - avoiding walks ( @xmath180 ) , this point is known as the @xmath186 point . using the duality discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] , we recently conjectured that the tricritical ht graphs at the same time represent the hulls of the fk clusters of the potts model with the same central charge @xmath120 as the tricritical o(@xmath178 ) model @xcite .",
    "this connection allowed us to predict the magnetic scaling dimension of the o(@xmath187 tricritical model , in excellent agreement with recent high - precision monte carlo data in the range @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "we started these notes mentioning the @xmath1 transition in liquid @xmath0he in terms of vortex proliferation . in closing , we wish to give the present status of that picture as established in a very recent high - precision monte carlo study of the 3d complex @xmath189 theory describing the transition @xcite .",
    "an important observable is the _ total _ vortex line density @xmath190 . by means of standard finite - size scaling analysis of the associated susceptibility @xmath191 ,",
    "the inverse critical temperature @xmath192 was estimated and shown to be perfectly consistent with the estimate of a previous study directly in terms of the original variables @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , when considering percolation observables , such as whether a vortex loop percolates the lattice , slight but statistically significant deviations from @xmath192 were found . for all observables considered , the percolation threshold @xmath193 .",
    "that is , from these observables one would conclude that the vortices proliferate too early at a temperature below the critical one ( as do geometrical clusters in 3d ) . yet",
    ", when taking the percolation threshold as an adjustable parameter , reasonable estimates were obtained from percolation observables for the critical exponents @xmath63 and @xmath29 , consistent with those of the xy model .",
    "the problem with the percolation threshold is quite possibly related to the way vortex loops are traced out .",
    "when two vortex segments enter a unit cell , it is not clear how to connect them with the two outgoing segments .",
    "a popular choice is to randomly connect them , but it might well be that the resulting network is too extended and consequently percolates too early .",
    "it is in our mind conceivable that a proper prescription for connecting vortex segments could lead to a vortex percolation threshold right at the critical temperature , in the spirit of the fk construction .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that even in cases where no thermodynamic phase transition takes place , the notion of vortex proliferation can be useful in understanding the phase structure of the system under consideration .",
    "an example is provided by the 3d abelian higgs lattice model with compact gauge field @xcite .",
    "in addition to vortices , the compact model also features magnetic monopoles as topological defects .",
    "it is well established that in the london limit , where the amplitude of the higgs field is frozen , it is always possible to move from the higgs region into the confined region without encountering thermodynamic singularities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the susceptibility data for various observables define a precisely located phase boundary .",
    "namely , for sufficiently large lattices , the maxima of the susceptibilities at the phase boundary do not show any finite - size scaling .",
    "moreover , the susceptibility data obtained on different lattice sizes collapse onto single curves without rescaling , indicating that the infinite - volume limit is reached . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that this phase boundary marks the location where the vortices proliferate .",
    "a well - defined and precisely located phase boundary across which geometrical objects proliferate , yet thermodynamic quantities remain nonsingular has become known as a _",
