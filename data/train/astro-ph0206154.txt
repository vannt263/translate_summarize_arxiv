    "while the quasar luminosity function has been studied extensively at redshifts below @xmath13 ( e.g. boyle , shanks & peterson  1988 ; hartwick & schade 1990 ; pei  1995 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; fukugita et al .  1996 ; gunn et al .  1998 ; york et al .",
    "2001 ) has in recent years substantially increased the number of quasars known at @xmath14 ( fan , strauss et al .",
    "2001a , b ; schneider et al .",
    "two samples of very high redshift sdss quasars have been presented to date .",
    "the first of these is a sample of 39 luminous quasars with redshifts in the range @xmath15 and a median of 4.3 .",
    "the second sample consists of 4 quasars at @xmath11 , including the quasar with the highest known redshift ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these samples begin to sketch out the luminosity function of quasars at @xmath17 and are very important for studies of the ionizing background radiation and of quasar evolution around the epoch of reionization ( haiman & loeb  1998 ) . although the logarithmic slope of the luminosity function for bright quasars admits a universal value of @xmath18 at redshifts @xmath19 , fan et al .",
    "( 2000a ) find a shallower logarithmic slope of @xmath20 for their luminous quasars at @xmath21 . at first sight",
    "this is a puzzling result because the exponential tail of the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function describing the space density of the massive host galaxies in which bright quasars are thought to reside , becomes progressively steeper with increasing redshift .",
    "there are several published models of varying complexity to describe the observed evolution of the quasar luminosity function within hierarchical structure formation theory ( efstathiou & rees 1988 ; small & blandford 1992 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; haiman & loeb  1998 ; haehnelt natarajan & rees  1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) . in these models , the luminosities and lifetimes of the quasars are governed by the black hole mass and the supply of cold accreting gas . the abundance and evolution of the supermassive black holes assumed to power the quasars , are linked to the evolution of the mass - function of galactic halos . the density of bright quasars is observed to decline rapidly with redshift below @xmath3 ( boyle , shanks & peterson  1988 ; hartwick & schade 1990 ) . this decline has been explained ( kauffman & haehnelt  2000 ; see also cavaliere & vittorini  2000 ) in terms of decreases in the merger rate and the availability of cold gas to fuel the black holes . in addition , the density of bright quasars is also observed to decline beyond a redshift of @xmath3 ( warren , hewett & osmer  1994 ; schmidt , schneider & gunn  1995 ; kennefick , djorgovski & de carvalho  1995 ) . under the assumption that quasar activity is related to the formation rate of halos , model luminosity functions",
    "have been constructed that successfully describe this decline and the shape of the luminosity function between @xmath3 and @xmath22 ( efstathiou & rees  1988 ; haehnelt & rees  1993 ; haiman & loeb  1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1999 ; haiman , madau & loeb  1999 ) .",
    "these models predict the luminosity function at still higher redshifts . with the recent influx of results on the quasar luminosity at redshifts above @xmath23 ,",
    "it is interesting to revisit the question of modeling the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at high redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that a very simple model can explain the new results on the high redshift quasar luminosity function .    our model for the evolution of the quasar luminosity function",
    "is based on the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function and halo merger rates computed with the excursion set formalism ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacy & cole  1993 ) .",
    "we show that this model can reproduce all of the known properties of the luminosity function above @xmath3 .",
    "we begin in  [ models ] by describing an approximate version of our model ( haiman & loeb  1998 ; hereafter hl98 ) , followed by the full discussion based on the halo merger rates . in  [ lumfuncobs ] and  [ cp ] we discuss the data on the quasar luminosity function and its comparison with our model .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of our model for gravitational lensing in high - redshift samples of quasars in  [ lens ] , and present our main conclusions in  [ conclusion ] . throughout the paper we assume density parameters of @xmath24 in matter , @xmath25 in a cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath26 . for calculations of the press - schechter  ( 1974 )",
    "mass function we assume a primordial power - spectrum with @xmath27 and the fitting formula to the exact transfer function of bardeen et al .",
    "we compare two models for the quasar luminosity function that are based on the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function of dark matter halos , and the halo merger rates from the excursion set formalism of bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and lacy & cole  ( 1993 ) .",
    "we begin with the approximate model of hl98 which is based on the halo formation rate .",
    "we then describe our more complete model based on halo merger rates .",
    "we will demonstrate in  [ comp ] that only this latter model reproduces all the known features of the quasar luminosity function above @xmath3 , as well as the local black hole ",
    "host halo mass relation and new constraints on the quasar duty cycle .",
    "hl98 discussed an approximate model for the high redshift quasar luminosity function by supposing that quasars are associated with newly formed halos .",
    "their model assumes that each galactic halo hosts a black hole with a mass ( @xmath28 ) which is a constant fraction ( @xmath29 ) of the host halo mass ( @xmath30 ) , and that the black hole shines at its eddington rate with a universal light - curve , @xmath31 .",
    "hl98 used the derivative of the press - schechter mass function to approximate the formation rate of halos , arguing that mergers are rare at high redshift so that the negative contribution to the derivative is negligible . in this model the quasar luminosity as a function of time is @xmath32 where @xmath33^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$ ] is the minimum halo mass inside which a black hole can form .",
    "this lower mass limit corresponds to the virial temperature below which atomic cooling is not effective in allowing the gas to sink to the center ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "following hl98 we write the resulting quasar luminosity function , defined as the comoving number density of quasars having rest frame b - band luminosities between @xmath34 and @xmath35 and redshifts between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the time at redshifts @xmath36 and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the change in the co - moving number density of black holes between @xmath41 and @xmath43 . integrating over @xmath28 we get @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the scale factor at a redshift @xmath36 .",
    "hl98 used an exponential with an @xmath46-folding time @xmath47 for the universal light curve @xmath48 .",
    "we find that the equivalent result for @xmath49 is obtained more simply by assuming a step function for @xmath48 , namely @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the eddington luminosity in b - band solar luminosity units for the median quasar spectrum ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , and @xmath52 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we then find @xmath53 given the formation redshift for the halo , @xmath54 . assuming that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and relating the space density of black holes to the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function through @xmath57 we obtain the following simple expression for the quasar luminosity function : @xmath58 we will compare this model to observations in  [ comphl ] .",
    "the hl98 model associates quasar activity with halo formation .",
    "the assumption is that the halo merger rate is rarer than the halo formation rate at high redshift .",
    "however , at low redshifts the formation rate becomes smaller than the merger rate , and the derivative of the press - schechter mass function on which the model is based , becomes negative .",
    "quasar activity at low redshift can be explained in relation to halo merger activity ( carlberg  1990 ; kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss a simple model that associates quasar activity at high redshift with the merger rate of halos .",
    "the merger rate of halos was computed by lacy & cole  ( 1993 ) based on the excursion set formalism of bond et al .",
    "we compute the number of halos having masses between @xmath59 and @xmath60 that accrete onto a halo of mass @xmath61 per unit time @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the number of merger events involving the accretion of a halo of mass @xmath59 by a halo of mass @xmath63 per unit time per comoving volume at a redshift @xmath36 is given by the product @xmath64    we assume that the mass of the central black hole scales as a power - law with the circular velocity ( @xmath65 ) of the halo , @xmath66 the circular velocity of a halo of mass @xmath30 at redshift @xmath36 can be written as ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) , @xmath67^\\frac{1}{6 } \\left({1+z}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{km}\\,\\mbox{s}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the final overdensity relative to the critical density at redshift @xmath36 , and @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "we can therefore write , @xmath72^\\frac{\\gamma}{6}h^{\\gamma/3}(1+z)^\\frac{\\gamma}{2},\\ ] ] and fit for two free parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 that describe the evolution and slope of the black hole  halo mass relation .",
    "we assume that the black holes coalesce upon halo merger ( kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) and find the number of black holes of mass between @xmath75 and @xmath76 that merge with black holes of mass @xmath77 per unit time : @xmath78 a linear relation ( @xmath79 ) between black hole mass and halo mass is a natural consequence of black hole growth that is dominated by coalescence with no gas accretion ( haehnelt et al . 1998 ) .",
    "values of @xmath80 result from significant gas accretion during the active quasar phase as deduced by yu & tremaine  ( 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that after a merger , a fraction of the cold gas from the accreted halo is driven onto the central black hole of mass @xmath28 ( mihos & hernquist  1994 ; hernquist & mihos  1995 ) .",
    "if the quasar shines at the eddington rate of the black hole in the merger product ( see , e.g. yu & tremaine  2002 ) , then the cold gas from the small accreted halo ( which makes up the new fuel reservoir ) will run out in a time approximately proportional to @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass in baryons within the accreted halo ) can be derived as a taylor expansion for minor mergers . for simplicity",
    "we apply it to all mergers . ] .",
    "thus we postulate that after a merger the quasar shines at the eddington rate corresponding to the merger product , for a time proportional to both the ratio between the masses of the accreted and initial halo and the baryon fraction of the accreted halo .    in order to examine whether the baryon mass fraction in the accreted halo would be affected by the photo - ionization heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) after reionization ,",
    "we have solved the linear growth factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the dark matter and baryons on a spatial comoving scale @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the average matter density of the universe today .",
    "these growth factors obey the following set of coupled differential equations for the dark matter and baryon overdensities @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the linear regime ( e.g. barkana & loeb  2001 ) : @xmath89\\\\ & & \\hspace{-15mm}\\ddot{\\delta}_{\\rm b } + 2 h\\dot{\\delta}_{\\rm b } = \\frac{3}{2}h^2\\left\\{[\\omega_{\\rm b}(z ) \\delta_{\\rm b}+\\omega_{\\rm dm}(z)\\delta_{\\rm dm}]\\right\\ } - \\frac{k_{\\rm b } t_{\\rm i } } { \\mu m_{\\rm p } } \\left(\\frac{k}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{a_{\\rm i}}{a}\\right)^{1+\\beta } \\left[\\delta_{\\rm b}+\\frac{2}{3 } \\beta ( \\delta_{\\rm b}-\\delta_{\\rm b , i})\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath90 is the gas temperature , @xmath91 the mean molecular weight ( @xmath92 for ionized igm ) , @xmath93 is boltzmans constant , and @xmath94 is the co - moving wave number for the mode of interest .",
    "the subscripts @xmath95 refer to quantities at an initial reference time and @xmath96 or 1 for adiabatic or isothermal evolution .",
    "we assume reionization at @xmath97 .",
    "before reionization we assume @xmath98 ; the baryon and dark - matter over - densities undergo the same evolution during this period .",
    "following reionization , the igm is assumed to be heated to @xmath99k and to evolve isothermally ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath84 is described by the superposition of solutions to equation  ( [ growthfac ] ) weighted by the fourier transform of the spatial tophat window function of width @xmath101 ( medvigy & loeb  2001 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of @xmath102 with redshift .",
    "the curves shown correspond ( from bottom to top ) to halo masses of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the dark matter growth factor corresponds to the upper envelope in this figure .",
    "prior to reionization @xmath84 follows @xmath83 for all halo masses .",
    "reinonizaton heats the igm and eliminates gas accretion onto small halos .",
    "the baryon overdensity in halos larger than @xmath112 is unaffected by reionization .",
    "thus , we find that the effect of reionization on the luminosity function is only apparent for quasars fainter than @xmath113 , which is well below the detection threshold of existing quasar surveys at @xmath114 , such as sdss .",
    "we therefore assume a fixed baryon mass fraction in objects relevant for the luminosity function of bright quasars at high redshifts .    the quasar light curve and luminosity function may therefore be written as @xmath115 and @xmath116 in analogy with equations  ( [ lcurve ] ) and ( [ phihl5 ] ) , respectively . integrating over @xmath28",
    "we find @xmath117 assuming @xmath55 , we then obtain @xmath118 , yielding the luminosity function @xmath119 the value of @xmath47 can be related to the duty cycle of quasars @xmath120 through consideration of the number of mergers during a hubble time @xmath121 , @xmath122 we will compare the luminosity function predicted by this model with observations in  [ comp ] .",
    "the standard double power - law luminosity function ( boyle , shanks & peterson  1988 ; pei  1995 ) @xmath123^{\\beta_{\\rm l}}+[l_{\\rm b}/l_*(z)]^{\\beta_{\\rm h}}}\\ ] ] provides a good representation of the observed quasar luminosity function at redshifts @xmath124 . at the faint end of the luminosity function , the slope is @xmath125 , while at the bright end @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , all dependence on redshift ( at @xmath127 ) is in the break luminosity @xmath128 indicating pure luminosity evolution . at low redshift",
    "the break luminosity evolves as a power - law in redshift , and the space density of bright quasars increases with redshift .",

    "( 2001a ) found from their sample of sdss quasars at @xmath0 that the slope at the bright end of the luminosity function has evolved from the @xmath124 value of @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",

    "@xmath120 is longer at higher redshift .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated the lifetime of bright quasar activity in a large statistical sample of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath8 to be @xmath7 yr , which is surprisingly close to our expected value of @xmath147 yr .",
    "above @xmath13 we find @xmath148 yr , comparable to the value inferred by comparing the local black hole density with the quasar luminosity function ( e.g. yu & tremaine  2002 ) .",
    "note that while @xmath120 becomes a substantial fraction of the age of the universe at the highest redshifts considered , individual episodes of quasar activity are shorter than @xmath47 , which is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "two results from the comparison between model and data stand out .",
    "first , the halo merger model reproduces the shallow slope for the @xmath0 quasars observed by fan et al .",

    "( 2001b ) .",
    "a detailed comparison between the data and the model at @xmath0 is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the left hand panel shows the luminosity function in the region measured by fan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the straight line with the error bar represents the empirical luminosity function ( best fit slope of @xmath149 ) and the uncertainty in its normalization .",
    "the upper solid line is the luminosity function of the merger rate model .",
    "the theoretical luminosity function slope is consistent with that of the observed quasars over the measured luminosity range .",
    "this is shown more clearly on the right hand panel of figure  [ fig3 ] where the derivative of the model luminosity function is shown in comparison with the empirical best fit slope ( solid line ) and the slope @xmath150 away ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the model is consistent within the quoted uncertainty over the measured luminosity range , particularly at the fainter end .",
    "our model luminosity function is consistent with the observed lower limit on the slope at @xmath151 , which fan et al .",
    "( 2000b ) quote as @xmath152 ( 95% ) .",
    "however the gravitational lensing rate may be very high in this sample ( wyithe & loeb  2002a , b ) .",
    "while the average slope of the luminosity function can not be changed significantly by lensing , we might easily be misled by the magnification of 1 or 2 quasars in the limited current sample of 4 .",
    "furthermore , lensing might increase the apparent space density of quasars by a factor of up to 2 ( wyithe & loeb  2002b ) .",
    "the predicted luminosity functions show that the slope of the bright end becomes significantly steeper at redshifts higher than @xmath133 as expected from the shape of the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function .",
    "the fit to the luminosity function discussed above has @xmath142 .",
    "an equally good fit can be obtained for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "however this value of @xmath73 is nearly an order of magnitude larger than observed ( ferrarese  2002 ) , and the implied duty cycle is nearly an order of magnitude too small ( yu & tremaine  2002 ; steidel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "hence , the complete set of observational constraints favors a value of @xmath142 .",
    "ferrarese & merritt  ( 2002 ) find a relation between @xmath28 and bulge velocity dispersion @xmath155 of @xmath156 while tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 , and references therein ) find @xmath157 .",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) attribute this disagreement primarily to the differences in the velocity dispersion measurements used by the two groups .",
    "unfortunately , the highly uncertain nonlinear scaling of @xmath158 ( ferrarese  2002 ) allows the results of both groups to be consistent with our favored value of @xmath142 ( which in turn translates to a mean slope of @xmath159 , in between the slopes of the two groups ) .",
    "the upper left hand panel of figure  [ fig2 ] indicates that the model luminosity function provides a poorer fit to the data at redshifts @xmath160 .",
    "the density of relatively faint [ @xmath161 at @xmath162 and @xmath163 at @xmath164 ( dashed lines ) ] quasars is reasonably reproduced , particularly at the lowest redshift considered .",
    "the model also predicts a decline in the number of bright quasars at low redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the model luminosity function is too shallow at the higher luminosities to explain the data . a simple observational explanation for this phenomenon might be the large drop in the average cosmic density of cold galactic gas from @xmath3@xmath4 to the present day ( storrie - lombardi , mcmahon & irwin  1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the inability of the gas to cool following the epoch of group and x - ray cluster formation would also contribute to the rapid decline in the luminosity function at low redshifts ( cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ) .",
    "thus , while the merger rate predicts a decrease in the space density of quasars at low redshifts , the more complicated low redshift environments require additional modeling ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) to reproduce the observed luminosity function shape .",
    "we find that the hl98 model (  [ modelhl ] ) requires yr , larger than our value of @xmath165 .",
    "haehnelt , natarajan & rees  ( 1998 ) also found a lower value @xmath47 in their model with constant @xmath29 . ]",
    "best - fit values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 yr . the resulting luminosity function is shown as the dotted lines in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the hl98 model and the halo merger model produce similar luminosity functions at @xmath144 .",
    "however , the predicted duty cycle is too low by two orders of magnitude , and the value of @xmath29 produced by this fit is too high by 2 orders of magnitude to be consistent with observations .    figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] indicate that the hl98 model produces a somewhat less consistent normalization at @xmath0 and a steeper slope at @xmath6 when compared with the halo merger model . at low redshifts the merger rate is higher than the collapse rate for halos in the mass range of interest .",
    "in fact , the derivative of the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function becomes negative and the model predicts a luminosity function with a sharp lower cutoff in luminosity ( in the implementation of hl98 the smooth function , @xmath31 , results in a softer cutoff ) .",
    "this is seen in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] . if quasar activity was associated solely with the halo formation rate , then only quasars residing within the very largest halos would be observed at low redshift .",
    "the fraction of quasars that are gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies is very sensitive to the underlying luminosity function due to the potentially large magnification bias ( turner 1980 ; turner , ostriker & gott  1984 ) . at low redshifts ( @xmath127 )",
    "the bright end of the luminosity function has a universal slope of @xmath168 .",
    "however at @xmath0 fan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) observed a slope of @xmath169 .",
    "wyithe & loeb  ( 2002a , b ) showed that empirical extrapolations of the low redshift quasar luminosity function to high redshifts yielded very different results for the gravitational lensing rate if one were to adopt a bright end slope that is @xmath168 at all redshifts or a slope that is @xmath169 above @xmath13 .",
    "since the halo merger model described in  [ lumfunc ] reproduces all measured properties of the quasar luminosity function at high redshifts , we use it to compute the magnification bias for multiple - image gravitational lenses .",
    "the magnification bias can then be used to find the fraction of all quasars ( at different redshifts ) that are multiply imaged .",
    "the lensing fraction for the sdss high redshift samples was discussed at length in wyithe & loeb  ( 2002a , b ) .",
    "we therefore give only a short summary here , and present results for the lens fraction obtained with the new luminosity function .",
    "the probability distribution of point source magnification by a singular , spherical isothermal lens in terms of the sum of the magnifications of multiple images , @xmath91 , is @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "the bias factor for multiple imaging in a flux limited sample brighter than ( absolute luminosity ) @xmath172 is therefore @xmath173 this magnification bias is plotted as a function of the limiting ( absolute ) luminosity in figure  [ fig6 ] .",

    "the resulting fraction of multiple images expected in the flux limited sample is @xmath178 in this expression @xmath179 is the multiple image optical depth , i.e. the source plane probability that a source will be multiply imaged for the observer . from wyithe & loeb  ( 2002b )",

    "in addition , we find @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( considering all galaxies as potential lenses ) at @xmath174 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the lens fraction @xmath185 is plotted on the right hand panel of figure  [ fig6 ] for @xmath174 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( bottom to top ) . while at low redshifts the lensing fraction is less than one percent , at higher redshifts the fraction could be much higher .",
    "the vertical dashed lines correspond to the limiting absolute luminosities of the sdss quasar samples at @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath190 ( right ) .",
    "these limits suggest lens fractions of @xmath191 in the sdss sample at @xmath0 and @xmath192 in the sdss sample at @xmath11 .",
    "note that the fractions at @xmath0 and @xmath6 are consistent with the value obtained for the flat luminosity function assumed in wyithe & loeb  ( 2002b ) . at even higher redshifts the lens fraction approaches unity .",
    "the luminosity function at @xmath193 predicts that quasars having luminosities brighter than a limit that corresponds to the same co - moving space density as the sdss quasars at @xmath6 have a lens fraction of @xmath194 .",
    "we predict the quasar luminosity function under the hypothesis that quasar activity is associated with galaxy mergers .",
    "galactic halos are assumed to each host a black hole having a mass determined from a power - law relation with halo circular velocity , @xmath195 . upon merger",
    "we assume that the gas from the accreted halo is driven to the center , and that the quasar then shines at its eddington rate for a short period of time , proportional to the ( smaller than 1/2 ) mass ratio between the small and final halos in the merger .",
    "our model has 3 free parameters but at least the following 5 constraints : the luminosity function slope and normalization at @xmath196 , the evolution of the luminosity function slope and normalization , and the curvature of the luminosity function .",
    "our model is simplified by the fact that the effect of reionization on the luminosity function is limited to luminosities much fainter than those detectable in current quasar surveys .",
    "this very simple model reproduces all known properties of the luminosity function above @xmath3 , including the recently measured luminosity function slope at @xmath0 ( fan et al .",
    "2001a ) and the space density of quasars at @xmath6 ( fan et al .",
    "the model suggests a black hole ",
    "halo mass relation , @xmath197 consistent with that found by ferrarese  ( 2002 ) at @xmath198 , and a duty cycle of @xmath199 yr consistent with previous determinations ( yu & tremaine  2002 ; steidel et al .",
    "2002 ) . using the derived luminosity function",
    "we predict the resulting lensing rates for the highest redshift samples . the recently published flux limited samples of sdss quasars at @xmath0 and @xmath11 are predicted to have multiple image fractions of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "the model luminosity function computed using the halo merger rates is consistent with the density of faint quasars at low redshifts , and predicts a decline in the density of bright quasars towards low redshifts , but predicts a luminosity function slope that is shallower than observed . as has been noted previously , a more careful analysis ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) is required to understand the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at low redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , the consistency of the faint quasar normalization stands in contrast to models that associate quasar activity with the halo formation rate , as those predict no faint quasars at low redshifts .",
    "thus one is led to conclude that mergers are the likely trigger for quasar activity at all redshifts .",
    "the @xmath28@xmath65 relation that provides the best fit to the data may also have a simple physical origin .",
    "first , consider dimensional analysis .",
    "if we make the minimal assumption that the limiting luminosity of a quasar is only a function of the halo circular velocity @xmath65 , then the only dimensional parameters in the problem are @xmath65 and @xmath200 ( newton s constant ) . the only combination of these parameters that has dimensions of luminosity is @xmath201 and so we conclude @xmath202 _ what is the physics behind this relation ? _ the value of @xmath203 amounts to depositing the entire binding energy of a self - gravitating system during its dynamical time ( so that it does not have time to adjust ) . the binding energy of a self - gravitating mass @xmath204 is @xmath205 and the dynamical time is @xmath206 .",
    "the ratio between these quantities is @xmath207 . using the virial relation @xmath208",
    ", we get the energy deposition rate that would unbind a self - gravitating system on its dynamical time , @xmath209 .",
    "a quasar may therefore unbind the gas in the galaxy around it if its power output is too large . ]",
    "( silk & rees 1998 ; ciotti & ostriker  2001 ) .",
    "as the mass of the black hole increases and the quasar s eddington luminosity approaches this limit , the feedback will generate a powerful galactic wind and terminate the accretion that feeds the quasar .",
    "hence , the quasar phenomenon may be self terminating ( similarly to the formation of a proto - star ) . of course , if some of the quasar energy escapes ( due to incomplete absorption , partial covering factor or efficient cooling by the surrounding gas ) , then the feedback - limited quasar luminosity would be higher than @xmath210 . as long as the feedback from all quasars encounters self - similar conditions in different halos ,",
    "we may write @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a constant that is related to the inferred value of @xmath73 . equations ( [ vc ] ) , ( [ eps ] ) , ( [ led ] ) and the best - fit value of @xmath213 together with the relation @xmath214 , yield @xmath215 . we have shown that the assumption of a constant @xmath212 in equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) leads to a luminosity function that describes the data over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the constancy of @xmath212 ( which is also expected from dimensional analysis ) implies that feedback may indeed be the mechanism that regulates the growth of supermassive black holes in galactic potential wells .",
    "the similarity between our deduced values of @xmath142 and @xmath216 at high redshifts and the values inferred for remnant black holes in the local universe ( ferrarese 2002 ; tremaine et al .",
