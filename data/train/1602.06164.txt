    "recent advances in nanotechnology enable successful fabrication and control of systems in length scales where quantum features and fluctuations are dominant .",
    "if we are to use these quantum systems for useful purposes , such as heat to work conversion ( i.e , as a quantum heat engine ) , we have to deal with the limitations imposed by quantum mechanics , such as quantum friction , on the thermodynamical transformations and cycles  @xcite .",
    "quantum friction is the hallmark of finite - time thermodynamical transformations .",
    "the infinitely long lasting ones are the reversible processes , which can drive the quantum systems from an equilibrium state to the another one .",
    "reversible processes are , in general , optimal for the work output and the operational efficiency of the quantum heat engines , but they are in the expense of power output . for better powered quantum engines ,",
    "one typically requires faster thermodynamical transformations , which are irreversible and drive the system outside of equilibrium states , leading to ( unwanted ) entropy production .    in the present contribution",
    ", we investigate the concept of internal friction , which is the irreversibility in closed quantum systems and arises when a quantum system undergoes non - ideal , finite - time parametric adiabatic transformation  @xcite . consider a parametrically driven quantum system with a time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath0 .",
    "let the system be prepared initially in an equilibrium state with a heat bath .",
    "then , let the system be detached from the heat bath and undergo a parametric unitary change of its hamiltonian from an initial @xmath1 to a final value @xmath2 in a time interval , @xmath3 . if we differ the average work done on the system in a finite - time , @xmath4 , and the one performed in an infinite time , @xmath5 , the difference is non - negative and introduces the non - adiabatic work performed on the system by the driving agent , i.e. , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this indeed defines the internal friction in the system .",
    "the system state adiabatically follows the path of equilibrium states in an infinitely long process .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 can be considered as a quantitative measure from the deviation of adiabaticity . if the final density matrix for the reversible adiabatic process @xmath8 has a well - defined temperature , for example @xmath9 , then the irreversible work is directly related to the quantum relative entropy between the relevant states through the relation , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the origin of internal friction is entirely quantum mechanical , as it arises when the system hamiltonian at different times does not commute , i.e. , @xmath11 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "it can be associated with the diabatic transitions between energy eigenbasis of the hamiltonian .",
    "when the transformation lasts in a finite time , the system state is unable to follow the temporary changes in the hamiltonian and therefore develops coherences in the energy frame .",
    "this leads to store additional parasitic internal energy in the system , corresponding to the `` waste energy '' , which should be released to a heat bath if we want to thermalize the system at the temperature @xmath9 by a subsequent process  @xcite .",
    "the parametric adiabatic transformations are constituents of the quantum otto and carnot cycles .",
    "therefore , the role of internal friction in quantum thermal devices has been devoted a considerable attention , recently  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the quantum friction is found to limit the performance of the quantum heat / refrigerator devices .",
    "the strategies to fight against dissipative effects of the internal friction have also been investigated in the context of quantum thermal engines .",
    "these strategies can be collect under the common titles as `` shortcuts to adiabaticity ''  @xcite and `` quantum lubrication ''  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we will not discuss the minimizing strategies of the internal friction in quantum systems .",
    "our main concern is the concept of the internal friction and to discuss how it arises in a driven quantum system .",
    "we follow the ideas and mathematical tools introduced in refs .",

    "the hamiltonian of the system is subject to a parametric change from an initial value @xmath1 to a final value @xmath2 in a unitary process ( named as forward protocol ) followed by a reverse unitary transformation of the hamiltonian from @xmath2 back to its initial value @xmath1 ( named as backward protocol ) . due to the misalignment in the magnetic fields of the system ,",
    "the internal friction naturally arises .",
    "we quantitatively study the deviation from the adiabaticity by using the quantum relative entropy between the initial density matrix of the forward protocol and the final density matrix of the backward protocol .",
    "we investigate how the internal friction depends on the transformation time as well as the path that the parametric transformation follows .",
    "our results reveal the non - monotone character of the non - adiabatic work as a function of total protocol time .",
    "we also show that considering different possible scheduling pulses that generates the unitary transformation , almost frictionless protocol can be obtained in finite times .",
    "our results can be relevant to the relation between the macroscopic and microscopic irreversibility ( loschmidt paradox )  @xcite and related time symmetry arguments  @xcite .",
    "developments in nano - engineering systems makes the question of irreversibility in nano - scale thermodynamics a practical concern  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they can serve for solid examples to clarify and shed some light onto discussions among the novel perspectives of quantum thermodynamics such as unified quantum formulation of mechanics and thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "in addition , extension of our approach to non - equilibrium thermodynamical systems can be an intriguing application  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that dissipative quantum dynamics , entropy production and irreversibility has been widely discussed from different point of views  @xcite ; including nonlinear systems  @xcite , general description of friction in quantum mechanics with stochastic master equation treatments can be found in the literature , too  @xcite .",
    "our particular case here is limited to irreversibility associated with finite time adiabatic transformations which is the source of a profound quantum internal friction effect when the adiabatic control process is incompatible with the free evolution .",

    "the latter protocol is the backward transformation of the hamiltonian from @xmath2 back to @xmath1 .",
    "the main consequence of such a protocol is to quantitatively measure the internal friction using the initial density matrix of the forward protocol and the final density matrix of the backward protocol , which have the same hamiltonian @xmath1 .    the schematic representation of the proposed unitary forward - backward protocol is given in fig .",
