    "recently spherical field theory has been introduced as a non - perturbative method for studying quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this approach is to decompose field configurations in a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean functional integral as linear combinations of spherical partial waves . regarding each partial wave as a distinct field in a new one - dimensional system , the functional integral",
    "is rewritten as a time - evolution equation , with radial distance serving as the parameter of time .",
    "the core idea of spherical field theory is to reduce quantum field theory to a set of coupled quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "the technique used is partial wave decomposition , but this can easily be generalized to other modal expansions .  instead of concentric spheres and partial waves",
    ", we might instead consider a generic smooth one - parameter family of ( @xmath2)-dimensional manifolds ( disjoint and compact ) and basis functions defined over each manifold .",
    "there are clearly many possibilities and we can optimize our expansion scheme to suit the specific problem at hand .",
    "one important and convenient feature of spherical field theory is that it eliminates the need to compactify space  the spherical quantization surface is already compact .",
    "this is useful for studying phenomena which might be influenced by our choice of boundary conditions , such as topological excitations .",
    "another interesting example arises in the process of quantization on noncommutative geometries .",
    "spherical field methods have recently been adapted to study quantum field theory on the noncommutative plane @xcite .  in many instances , however , maintaining exact translational invariance",
    "is of greater value than non - compactness or exact rotational invariance .  in that case",
    "one could consider a system whose spatial dimensions have been compactified to form a periodic box .",
    "the next step would be to expand field configurations using free modes of the box and evolve in time .",
    "we will refer to this arrangement as periodic - mode field theory or , more simply , periodic field theory .    in periodic field theory",
    "the hamiltonian is time independent and linear momentum is exactly conserved .  in this work",
    "we describe the basic features of periodic field theory and use it to analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking in euclidean two - dimensional @xmath1 theory .",
    "we use the method of diffusion monte carlo to simulate the dynamics of the theory .",
    "the techniques discussed here have several advantages over conventional euclidean lattice monte carlo methods .",
    "one is that periodic boundary conditions are not imposed on the time variable , making it easier to determine the particle mass from an exponential decay fit .",
    "another is that the zero - momentum mode is regarded as a single degree of freedom ( rather than a collective mode on the lattice ) , which provides a simpler description of vacuum expectation values and symmetry breaking .",
    "other advantages arise in systems not considered here , such as the absence of fermion doubling and extensions to minkowski space using non - stochastic computational methods .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a derivation of periodic field theory .",
    "we then analyze two - dimensional @xmath1 theory and its corresponding periodic - field hamiltonian using diffusion monte carlo methods .",
    "we compute the critical coupling at which @xmath3 reflection symmetry is broken , and determine the critical exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "is associated with the inverse correlation length , and @xmath5 corresponds with the behavior of the vacuum expectation value of @xmath6 . ]  we find that our value of the critical coupling is in agreement with recent lattice results @xcite , and our values for the critical exponents are consistent with  predictions via universality and the two - dimensional ising model .",
