    "there is up to day no fully satisfying covariant gauge fixing of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the common faddeev - popov ( fp ) procedure is known to be invalid because of the gribov ambiguity @xcite : the gauge constraint ( such as @xmath1 in the landau gauge ) have many solutions ( gribov copies ) equivalent up to a gauge transformation .",
    "taking into account this ambiguity would give non - perturbative contributions ( typically of the form @xmath2 ) that vanish at all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "consequently , the fp procedure is actually justified when studying high energy phenomena and the perturbative predictions are in excellent agreement with the experiments . on the other range of the spectrum , when considering infrared ( ir )",
    "properties , the perturbative analysis extracted from the fp procedure is inconsistent because the coupling becomes large .",
    "the coupling is found to diverge at a finite energy scale ( known as a landau pole ) but of course this prediction is out of the range of validity of perturbation theory .",
    "there are two possible explanations of the failure of the perturbative predictions of the fp procedure .",
    "either the coupling indeed reaches large values ( but this seems to be at odds with the lattice simulation results ) or some nonperturbative effects , such as the gribov ambiguity , invalidates the fp procedure itself .",
    "in fact , we can avoid fixing the gauge by simulating gauge invariant quantities on the lattice and most of the ir studies are done in this way",
    ". however it would be convenient to have some analytic ( or semi - analytic ) predictions in that regime , which seem to require to fix the gauge ( see however @xcite ) , and therefore to take into account the gribov ambiguity .",
    "several analytic methods have been considered in order to access the ir properties .",
    "the most developed is based on the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations @xcite , which consist in an infinite set of coupled equations for the vertex functions . in order to make predictions , it is necessary to truncate in some way this infinite set .",
    "different schemes have been proposed but most of them consider the equations for the 2-point functions with an ansatz for the 3 and 4-point functions .",
    "( most of the analyses have been done in the landau gauge and we restrict the discussion to this gauge in the rest of the paper . ) this leads to some predictions on the behavior of the ghost and gluon propagators and two types of solutions have been found . in the so - called scaling solution @xcite , both propagators have a power - law behavior in the ir ,",
    "the ghost propagator is more singular than the bare one and the gluon propagator approaches zero in that limit .",
    "the exponents governing these two power - laws are not independent . in the so called decoupling solution ( or massive solution ) @xcite , the gluon propagator goes to a constant in the ir and the ghost propagator is as singular as in the bare theory .",
    "these correlation functions were also studied in the framework of the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) equation @xcite .",
    "again , one has to make some truncations in an infinite set of coupled equations @xcite .",
    "the results again depend on the approximation scheme , but seem to be consistent with the scaling solution .    a third approach , known as the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) model @xcite , relies more specifically on the influence of the gribov copies . by introducing several auxiliary fields , it is possible to restrict effectively the functional integration on the gluon field to the first gribov region where the fp operator is positive definite .",
    "it was originally expected that this restriction would give an unambiguous gauge fixing but it was later realized that many copies of some field configuration were present within the first gribov region @xcite .",
    "this procedure significantly reduces the number of gribov copies but unfortunately not to a single one .",
    "the gribov ambiguity is therefore still present in this model . in the first implementations of the gz model , the predictions for the propagators were consistent with the scaling solution .",
    "more recently a refined version of this model was introduced @xcite , that takes into account the appearance of some condensates .",
    "the results are then consistent with the massive solution of sd equations .    the results obtained in the sd approach triggered a large activity from the lattice community . since the predictions of the sd approaches are mostly for gauge dependent quantities , it was necessary to implement a gauge fixing procedure in the lattice , at odds with usual simulations .",
    "one of the merits of the precursor work of alkofer and von  smekal @xcite was to discard very singular solutions found previously for the gluon propagator and this was confirmed by the lattice simulations .",
    "however , a broad consensus on the details of the simulation results in @xmath3 and 4 was achieved only recently , mainly through large lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that in these dimensions , the simulations support the massive solution .",
    "the @xmath4 case is different in this respect  @xcite and is well described by the scaling solution and the explanation of this difference is still unclear ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite , we proposed an alternative to the analytical methods described above .",
    "its motivation relies on the fact that we do not have so far a fully justified covariant gauge fixing procedure that can be handled in analytical calculations .",
    "ideally , we should try to construct such a unambiguous gauge - fixing procedure , but this is an extremely hard task .",
    "alternatively , we propose to construct a model that uses as guiding principle the behavior of correlation functions observed on the lattice and that respects as many important known properties of correlation functions as possible .",
    "more precisely , since the gluon propagator is observed to be massive in the lattice simulations ( for @xmath0 ) , we propose to include this mass term directly at the bare level .",
    "( this corresponds to a particular case of the curci - ferrari model @xcite . )",
    "this modifies the theory in the ir but preserves the standard fp predictions for momenta @xmath5 at all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the mass term does not spoil the renormalizability .",
    "this model reproduces at one loop order with excellent precision the lattice predictions .",
    "we also showed that the spectral function of the gluons is not positive - definite , in agreement with other studies @xcite .",
    "our aims in the present article are the following .",
    "first , we give a detailed version of the calculations presented in @xcite , including some other one loop calculations that were not presented in the previous work for lack of space .",
    "second , we show that an appropriate renormalization scheme can be chosen that does not present a landau pole in the ir .",
    "third , we discuss in detail the size of higher loop corrections showing that , in fact , they seem to be rather small .",
    "this opens the door to perturbative calculations in qcd in the ir regime , with a huge number of possible applications .",
    "fourth , we analyze the @xmath4 case and explain why in the present model it is very different from the @xmath0 case .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we describe in detail the model and its general properties . in sect .",
    "iii , we present the 1-loop perturbative calculation of the 2-point functions and compare our results with the lattice data in @xmath6 and @xmath3 . in sect .",
    "iv , we perform a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of these propagators .",
    "we propose two different renormalization schemes , one of which is shown to be ir safe in the sense that it leads to no landau pole in the ir .",
    "we compare the rg results with the lattice data in @xmath6 and @xmath3 . in sect .",
    "v , we discuss the @xmath4 case .",
    "some technical details are presented in two appendices .",
    "as said in the introduction , the fp action is not justified at a non - perturbative level . in this section ,",
    "we present a modification of the fp action in the landau gauge , based on phenomenological considerations .",
    "our main guide is the observation that the gluon propagator tends to a finite positive value in the ir for @xmath0 .",
    "we propose to impose this property at the tree level by adding a mass term for the gluon in the fp action .",
    "we do not change the ghost sector since the ghost propagator is found to be ir divergent in the simulations .",
    "this may also be motivated by assuming that the shift symmetry @xmath7 is preserved beyond perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , we do not want to modify interactions in the action so as to preserve the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior of the theory and maintain the predictions of perturbative qcd ( or gluodynamics ) for momenta much larger than @xmath8 . from this analysis",
    "it is clear that if we choose not to modify the field content of the theory , mass terms are the only local and renormalizable modifications of the fp action that do not affect the uv behavior of the model .",
    "if we restrict to local terms , the only other possible way to modify the action is to introduce new fields as done in the gz model  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the appearance of the effective mass term in the ir is a complex problem and could be related with the gribov ambiguity , with some kind of condensates ( see for example @xcite ) , or with other nonperturbative effects , but our phenomenological approach does not rely on which of these scenarios is valid .",
    "this analysis leads us to consider the landau - gauge fp euclidean lagrangian for pure gluodynamics , supplemented with a gluon mass term : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the field strength @xmath11 are expressed in terms of the coupling constant @xmath12 and the latin indices correspond to the @xmath13 gauge group .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ eq_lagrang ] ) corresponds to a particular case of the curci - ferrari model  @xcite . at the tree level ,",
    "the gluon propagator is massive and transverse in momentum space : @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectral density associated with the propagator  ( [ eq_propag_bare ] ) is positive and therefore there is no violation of positivity at the tree level . as discussed in @xcite , violations of positivity are present in the model but they are caused by fluctuations .",
    "the gluon propagator observed in the lattice is not compatible at a quantitative level with the bare propagator  ( [ eq_propag_bare ] ) and we will show below that , by including the one - loop corrections , one obtains propagators for gluons and ghosts that are in impressive agreement with those obtained in the lattice in @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us mention that a mass term has been used to improve perturbative qcd results in order to reproduce the phenomenology of strong interactions  @xcite . moreover , there are successful confinement models  @xcite that use actions including a gluon mass term .",
    "the difference with the model used in those works is that the curci - ferrari model is renormalizable , allowing to perform perturbative calculations at any order .",
    "this also implies that the uv beta function identifies with the standard results of the fp procedure .",
    "when analyzing the model described above , we must face the problem that the mass term breaks the brst symmetry  @xcite which is very important in the perturbative analysis .",
    "this symmetry has the form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a global grassmanian parameter .",
    "the brst symmetry is in general used to prove the renormalizability of the theory . however , the breaking of the brst symmetry by the mass term is soft and therefore does not spoil renormalizability  @xcite .",
    "the brst symmetry is also used to reduce the state space to the physical space , in which the theory is unitary ( at least at the perturbative level ) and breaking this symmetry spoils the standard proof of unitarity .",
    "this problem is actually common to essentially all methods that try to go beyond the standard perturbation theory ( as the gz model ) because they all break the standard brst symmetry . in this respect ,",
    "the model considered here is not in a worse position than other approaches considered in the field .",
    "we must insist that this model is equivalent to the standard fp model in the uv limit @xmath18 if @xmath19 .",
    "this means that in the domain of validity of standard perturbation theory , the model is as unitary as qcd .",
    "the unitarity of the model in other momentum regimes is of course an important open problem , as it is in all gauge fixings in which standard brst symmetry is broken .",
    "the model with lagrangian  ( [ eq_lagrang ] ) , as a particular case of the curci - ferrari model , has a pseudo - brst symmetry ( not nilpotent ) that has the same form as the standard brst  ( [ brst ] ) except for the @xmath20 variation which reads @xmath21 . on top of this symmetry",
    ", the lagrangian has all the standard symmetries of the fp action for the landau gauge .",
    "this includes the shift in antighost @xmath22 , a symplectic group  @xcite , and four gauged supersymmetries . ]",
    "@xcite . as a consequence , the mass  @xcite and coupling constant  @xcite renormalization factors",
    "are fixed in terms of gluon and ghost field renormalizations .",
    "more precisely , by using the standard definition of renormalization factors ( here the subscript b denote bare quantities corresponding to their respective renormalized quantities without subscript ) : @xmath23 one can prove that the divergent part of the renormalization factors ( or , similarly , the renormalization factors themselves in a @xmath24 scheme ) verify the two non - renormalization theorems @xcite : @xmath25 these non - renormalization theorems are particular cases of those found in the curci - ferrari model for any gauge parameter @xmath26 , as proven recently @xcite .",
    "the finite parts of renormalized vertices also verify non - renormalization theorems , as will be discussed below , but their explicit form depend on the considered renormalization scheme .",
    "we present in this section a strict 1-loop calculation ( that is , without taking into account rg effects ) of gluon and ghost propagators in arbitrary dimension .",

    "let us first consider the calculation of the ghost self - energy in arbitrary dimension using dimensional regularization . only one diagram contributes ( see second line of fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) .",
    "the only difference with respect to standard yang - mills calculations is the form of the bare gluon propagator ( [ eq_propag_bare ] ) .",
    "introducing feynman parameters and performing internal momentum integrals one easily arrives at the following expression for the ghost 2-point vertex : @xmath35 the remaining integral can be performed analytically in integer dimensions as discussed below .",
    "let us only mention here the uv divergent part when @xmath36 : @xmath37 this is in agreement with previous calculations in the literature @xcite .",

    ", one must consider the sum of those self - energies with a bare contribution with renormalization factors .",
    "when @xmath44 approaches an integer dimension , the remaining integrals can be performed analytically .    once the renormalization conditions are imposed ( see eq .",

    "one observes that both gluon and ghost propagators can be fitted with the same choice of parameters in a very satisfactory way .",
    "note that the normalization conditions used in lattice simulations are not ( [ rencond ] ) .",

    "= 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm    = 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm    we have also compared our results with the data of two different lattice studies  @xcite for the @xmath51 group .",
    "these two data sets have different overall momentum scale and we have rescaled the momenta of the data of  @xcite for superimposing them with those of  @xcite .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath47 case where data are only available in a small momentum interval up to 1.9 gev , the data for @xmath51 were computed for momenta up to 8 gev .",
    "consequently one can explore the cross - over from standard perturbative results when @xmath52 is significantly larger than @xmath27 ( requiring rg methods ) and an ir regime similar to the one analyzed in the @xmath47 case .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig4dsu3 ] the gluon propagator and the ghost dressing function .",
    "we present also the gluon dressing function @xmath53 in order to make visible the uv regime .",
    "the best choice of parameters is @xmath54 and @xmath55  gev ( again with the renormalization prescription imposed at @xmath50 gev ) and it leads to a very satisfying agreement for momenta @xmath56  gev .",
    "beyond 2  gev , the agreement is not as good but this is not a surprise because expressions ( [ 4dprops ] ) are 1-loop results obtained from a fixed coupling constant calculation in a fixed renormalization point .",

    "[ fig4dsu3 ] . in any case , it is obvious that when @xmath5 , the model ( [ eq_lagrang ] ) reproduces correctly the high momentum regime once rg effects are taken into account because it just coincides in that case with the standard fp model .",

    "we choose to compare @xmath12 with the results of @xcite which make use of a very similar renormalization scheme : the coupling is defined through the taylor scheme and the ghost renormalization factor is fixed by the second line of eq .",
    "( [ rencond ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the gluon renormalization factor is fixed by the condition @xmath59 .",
    "because of the non - renormalization theorem of the coupling , this amounts to a relation between the coupling constant @xmath60 of @xcite and our which reads : @xmath61 we extract from fig . 1 of ref .",

    "the error is about 20% which , as discussed below is the typical estimate of higher loop corrections , see sect.[ir_suppress ] .",
    "an interesting feature of the 1-loop gluon propagator is that it is increasing in the ir . in fact",

    "as in @xmath6 , the 2-point vertex functions can be obtained in an explicit form : @xmath65 @xmath66 where again @xmath46 .",
    "these expressions are finite because in @xmath6 all divergences are logarithmic and lowering the dimension reduces the level of uv divergence of any diagram . accordingly",
    ", a possible renormalization scheme could be to use as renormalized parameters just the bare ones ( that are finite ) .",
    "however it is well known that is is more convenient to chose a renormalization scheme where renormalized parameters are defined at a running scale .",
    "this corresponds to a finite renormalization with respect to the bare parameters .",
    "this is convenient in order to avoid large perturbative corrections .",
    "moreover , choosing renormalized parameters at a running scale will allow us to perform a rg analysis in the next sections ( that improves considerably the results ) . in the present section we use the renormalization conditions  ( [ rencond ] ) .",

    "we will show below that the inclusion of rg effects improve significantly one - loop results .",
    "= 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm    in any case , our calculation reproduces the finite ir gluon propagator and ghost dressing function .",
    "it also reproduces the increasing behavior of the gluon propagator in the ir .",
    "indeed , an expansion of the inverse propagator at low momentum leads to @xmath70 .",
    "we showed in the previous section that the 1-loop perturbative results compare very well with the lattice data up to energies of order 2 gev and get worse at higher energies .",
    "this is not a surprise since in @xmath6 the perturbation theory generates logarithms of the momentum divided by some momentum scale ( the mass or the renormalization point @xmath71 ) .",
    "the pure perturbation theory fails at energies higher than 2 gev because these logarithms are large and one needs to implement the ideas of rg .",
    "actually since we have massless modes ( ghosts ) in the theory , it is expected a priori that the rg is necessary also for @xmath72 .",
    "we will see however that in this particular model , the ir behavior is milder than expected , essentially because ghosts interact by the exchanging gluons which are massive .    for @xmath73 , the uv behavior does not present large logarithms , and consequently the use of the rg is not mandatory in that regime .",
    "however , in practice , taking into account rg effects may improve the quantitative results .",
    "this idea is natural , but we are not able to test it because there is no uv data available in @xmath3 or @xmath4 . for @xmath73 , a rg adapted for the ir",
    "is much more important than for @xmath6 and at the end of the present section we show that such a rg procedure improves considerably the results in @xmath3 .",
    "the comprehension of the @xmath4 case also improves considerably by the inclusion of rg effects but this discussion is postponed to sect .",

    "is also valid for the finite parts .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the @xmath74 function of the coupling constant : @xmath86 the choice of a normalization prescription at vanishing momentum for the gluon 2-point vertex simplifies greatly the analytical treatment because as shown in the appendix [ sect_non - renorm ] the following relation is satisfied for the finite parts of the propagators and dressing functions : @xmath87 it is then easy to prove that : @xmath88    the perturbative results together with the renormalization scheme ( [ rencond ] ) enables us to compute the anomalous dimensions .",

    "observe that these @xmath74 functions are not only function of the coupling constant @xmath12 ( as for example if we use the @xmath24 scheme ) , but also depend on the dimensionless ratio @xmath92 . in principle , once these flow equations are integrated with some appropriate initial conditions , we would need to make another integral to determine @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_def_z_phi ] ) ) in order to determine the inverse propagators . however , since the flows of @xmath12 and @xmath95 are expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions for the ghost and gluon fields , these integrals can be done explicitly : @xmath96 @xmath97    studying the behavior of these anomalous dimensions for @xmath71 much larger and much smaller than @xmath27 together with eq .",
    "( [ eq_def_beta_g ] ) , we find : @xmath98 in the uv ( @xmath99 ) we obtain the standard , universal , @xmath74 function .",
    "this is in contrast to other approaches where masses are introduced in yang - mills theory but modifying the uv behavior of the model @xcite . in the ir ( @xmath100 )",
    ", we observe that , although smaller in absolute value than in the uv , @xmath101 remains negative which means that the coupling constant diverges at a finite energy scale : we encounter a landau pole in the integration .",
    "however , we stress that there are no large quantum corrections when @xmath102 ( at least when @xmath0 ) because there is no ir divergences . in this configuration ,",
    "a natural scheme is to use strict perturbation theory for @xmath103 and a rg improvement when @xmath104 .",
    "the absence of ir divergences might be surprising since the ghosts are massless .",
    "a simple way of understanding this is to observe that all diagrams , except those with a single ghost loop , include at least one gluon propagator , which regularize the ir behavior ( this issue is discussed in more detail in appendix [ appendix_suppress ] ) . in this sense a purely perturbative calculation for momenta @xmath105 1 gev and a rg improvement for uv regime ( @xmath106 1 gev ) is fully justified . in practice , since the rg flow presents a landau pole at an energy scale not far from 1gev , we want to make the matching at a higher energy , but lower than 2 gev where strict perturbation theory begins to become untrustable .",
    "a compromise is to perform the matching condition at 1.5 gev and this gives impressively good results , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4dsu3 ] .",
    "a drawback of the procedure described in the previous section is that there is some arbitrariness on the choice of the matching scale to join strict perturbative and rg results . in this sense a unified procedure , valid at all scales would be more satisfactory and this motivates the search for an ir safe rg scheme .    in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to note that the ir landau pole that appears in the previous rg scheme is not a physical effect but is actually a consequence of our renormalization scheme ( [ rencond ] ) .",
    "indeed , the prescriptions we chose there are _ not _ consistent , if @xmath71 is too small , with the 1-loop results ( and with the actual behavior observed in lattice simulations in @xmath3 ) that lead to an increasing propagator in the ir ( see sect .",
    "[ strictperturb ] ) . in order to avoid this problem and be able to take renormalization prescriptions at arbitrary scales , we present here a scheme which is not based on an explicit constraint of the 2-points vertex function but which comes from the nonrenormalization theorem ( [ no - renorm2 ] ) . in practice",
    ", we replace the first condition in ( [ rencond ] ) by imposing the relation : @xmath107 not only for the divergent parts but also for the finite parts .",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath95 does not correspond any more to the value of the renormalized propagator at zero momentum and accordingly there is no contradiction with the increase of the propagator in the ir .    within this new scheme ,",

    "the @xmath74 function for the mass is now changed to : @xmath108 the anomalous dimension for the ghost is unchanged ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_gamma_c ] ) ) while the anomalous dimension for the gluon field reads : @xmath109 where , as before , @xmath110 . finally , the expressions relating @xmath93 and @xmath94 to the coupling constants read now : @xmath111 @xmath112    the uv universal behavior of the @xmath74 function ( for @xmath99 ) is unchanged as expected . however , we observe that the beta function for the coupling constant in the ir is now _ positive _ : @xmath113 we need to insist on the fact that the universality of the beta function is only valid for mass - independent schemes or for @xmath114 up to two - loop order . in particular , for @xmath115",
    "there is no reason for the beta function to be scheme independent and it is typically not the case . the result ( [ irbeta ] ) means that in the present scheme , the ir behavior is possibly safe . actually , depending on the initial conditions of the flow we do , or do not , hit a landau pole .",

    "= 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm = 7.6 cm    a second consequence of this ir behavior is that if the flow does not hit a landau pole , then the coupling constant is attracted towards zero in the ir : the massive gaussian fixed point is attractive .",
    "this is a very appealing property because this justifies the use of perturbation theory in the regime @xmath72 , although its use at intermediate momenta ( @xmath116 ) is more delicate .",
    "the validity of perturbation theory at intermediate momenta is discussed in sect .",

    "the only region where a significative departure is seen is for intermediate momenta ( 1 gev @xmath119 2 gev ) for the gluon dressing function .",
    "the results , however , are not as good as those obtained with the scheme of sect .",
    "[ zeromomscheme ] .",
    "this may be surprising and we now explain why it is not so .",
    "first , as already mentioned and explained in detail in the appendix [ appendix_suppress ] , there are no ir divergences and consequently the use of rg is not mandatory for @xmath120 .",
    "second , the results of the previous section have been obtained by a mixed treatment , by using the best fit of strict perturbation theory and imposing a matching with rg results in the uv .",
    "the results discussed here are obtained with a unified treatment , valid at all scales .",
    "this is a more challenging situation because we do not have the freedom of choosing the matching scale . in this sense",
    "the ir safe scheme gives a more satisfying construction .",
    "third , as discussed in sect .  [ ir_suppress ] even if the relevant coupling in the present model is never large , it is nevertheless not very small . accordingly",
    "the result obtained in the present section are quite satisfactory and the surprise is more the level of precision achieved in the previous one .",
    "a possible explanation is that the choice of rg prescriptions that can be directly read from correlation functions ( and not from an implicit rg scheme as done in ( [ newrenormcond ] ) ) , may in practice reduce the contributions of higher loop corrections . in any case",
    "we may expect that two - loop corrections should improve considerably the present results and correspondingly reduce the scheme dependence of them .",
    "finally , the coupling constant compares much better with the one extracted from lattice simulations ( see eq .",

    "we saw in the previous subsection , that in that regime , the beta function for the coupling constant is positive and accordingly the gaussian ir fixed point is attractive . when @xmath123 , the coupling constant @xmath12 has dimension @xmath124^{(4-d)/2}$ ] and it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless coupling @xmath125 in order to analyze a process with characteristic momentum @xmath71",
    "of course , it may be appropriate to use powers of the mass in order to define a dimensionless coupling .",
    "this point is discussed below ( see sect .",
    "[ ir_suppress ] ) , but for the moment let us concentrate on the choice  ( [ gtilde ] ) which is the natural definition of the dimensionless coupling in the uv regime ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the @xmath74-function associated with @xmath126 is : @xmath127 for dimensional reasons , the function @xmath128 is only a function of @xmath126 and of the dimensionless squared mass : @xmath129 for any @xmath73 , as well known , in the uv regime ( @xmath114 or , equivalently @xmath130 ) , the coupling @xmath126 approaches rapidly a gaussian fixed point because of the dominance of the dimensional term @xmath131 .",
    "the case @xmath6 is also dominated by a gaussian fixed point in the uv , because of the negative sign of the @xmath132 term . at intermediate momenta",
    "@xmath133 , the expressions of the @xmath128 function is very complicated in arbitrary dimensions and its ( non illuminating ) expression involves special functions .",
    "however in the ir regime @xmath122 things become easier again , and one can give an explicit expression for the @xmath128 function at one - loop : @xmath134 the coefficient of the @xmath135 term is regular ( and non zero ) in all dimensions @xmath136 .",
    "one observes the appearence of an ir fixed point @xmath126 : @xmath137 when @xmath36 , the expression ( [ irbetaanyd ] ) approaches the @xmath6 result ( [ irbeta ] ) and the fixed point value approaches the gaussian limit @xmath138 .",
    "the coherence of these results relies on the hypothesis that @xmath139 when @xmath140 . to check this hypothesis",
    ", we write the @xmath74 function for the dimensionless mass @xmath141 : @xmath142 as before , the uv regime ( where @xmath143 ) is compatible with @xmath144 and this can already be seen in the @xmath145 term .",
    "the intermediate momentum regime ( @xmath133 ) gives complicated expressions , but the ir regime again simplifies to : @xmath146 note that the pre - factor of @xmath147 of this expression is twice the pre - factor of @xmath135 in the eq .",
    "( [ irbetaanyd ] ) .",
    "consequently when @xmath148 approaches its ir fixed point : @xmath149 for @xmath0 , this implies that a regime with @xmath139 and @xmath150 exists ( under the hypothesis that the flow does not hit a landau pole before approaching it ) .",
    "note that the dimensionless square mass diverges as @xmath151 , but the dimensionful mass goes to zero for @xmath73 .",
    "this is not incompatible with the fact the gluon propagator is finite in the zero momentum limit , because in the present scheme , the mass is _ not _ defined through the renormalization condition ( [ rencond ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that : @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath4 case is different . in that dimension ,",
    "the coupling constant would approach a fixed point in an hypothetical ir regime , but the leading contribution to the flow of @xmath141 is zero and one must analyze sub - leading contributions .",
    "this important particular case is analyzed in sect .",
    "[ 2dcase ] .      having considered the general ir behavior , we now repeat the calculation of the sect .",

    "the dimensionless running mass @xmath156 increases when @xmath71 decreases and we get an ir regime when @xmath122 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this regime is characterized by the @xmath122 limit of the function @xmath128 that for @xmath3 is @xmath157 and the corresponding ir fixed point is @xmath158 in the sect .",
    "[ ir_suppress ] it is discussed why , in fact , these couplings are not as large as it seems here .",
    "we want here only to discuss the corresponding consequences for gluon and ghosts propagators .",
    "the rg equations can be integrated numerically and from them , the propagators can be obtained as discussed in the @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3d ] .",
    "we note that the inclusion of these rg running considerably improve the results when compared with those of strict one - loop perturbative results and now compare very well with lattice simulations .",
    "this is not surprising , because even if the present model does not have ir divergences it is very usual that rg effects play an important role in field theories below four dimensions even at moderate values of the couplings .",
    "the coupling constants that appear along this work are frequently relatively large at intermediate scales @xmath159  gev .",
    "this situation is much better than having a landau pole , but it is anyway problematic for a perturbative analysis . in this section we argue that although the coupling constant is not small , the perturbation theory seems to be under control anyway .    first of all , as is well known @xcite , the parameter expansion is not @xmath160 but , because of angular factors and group factors : @xmath161 where @xmath52 is the momentum scale used to define the coupling constant . in @xmath123 , @xmath12 has dimension @xmath162 and the power of momenta in the previous formula is necessary in order to have a dimensionless expansion parameter .",
    "the angular factors considerably reduces the size of the expansion parameter .",
    "for example , for @xmath6 and @xmath163 , this expansion parameter has a maximum at values of order one as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4dparam ] .",
    "there is actually another effect that suppresses the radiative corrections in the ir as we discuss now in detail .",
    "note that when momenta are much smaller than the gluon mass , all diagrams that include internal gluon lines are suppressed by inverse powers of the gluon mass .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , as shown in appendix  [ appendix_suppress ] , the present model does not present ir divergences for @xmath0 at non - exceptional momenta .",
    "this is surprising at first sight since there are massless modes ( ghosts ) , but it can be understood because their interactions are mediated by massive gluons .",
    "a second consequence is that in that regime , the leading contributions are those with a minimum number of gluon propagators and we can consider an effective theory where the only dynamical degrees of freedom are the ( massless ) ghosts . in this effective theory , gluons appear only as external sources coupled to the ghosts via the bare ghost - gluon vertex while the ghosts interact via an effective four - point vertex that behaves as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the anti - ghost momenta . that this effective field theory is also ir safe for non - exceptional momenta for @xmath0 . ]",
    "this implies that the effective expansion parameter is suppressed by @xmath167 where @xmath52 is a typical external momentum . a naive interpolation between the uv parameter expansion @xmath168 given in ( [ expansionparam ] ) and the one relevant for the ir would be : @xmath169    = 7.6 cm    as shown in fig .  [ 4dparam ]",
    "this parameter is indeed relatively small and this makes a perturbative analysis well founded .",
    "actually , in a small region around 1  gev , the expansion parameter is of the order of 0.4 .",
    "this means that 2-loop corrections in this region will give contributions of order @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) , which fits with the discrepancy between the 1-loop results and the lattice results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4drg ] .",
    "a 2-loop calculation would give a more precise estimate of higher order corrections .",
    "similar results apply for other values of @xmath172 and @xmath44 . as an example",
    ", the same curve is presented for @xmath173 and @xmath3 in fig  [ 3dparam ] .",
    "it is shown that the actual values in the ir are slightly larger but remain relatively small .",
    "the explicit expression for propagators can also be obtained in @xmath4 . as before , there are no uv divergences for the same reasons as for @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding result is : @xmath174 @xmath175 where , again @xmath46 .    within the model , the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath0 which is observed in the lattice ( see the introduction )",
    "appears natural . in @xmath4 , we find that the gluon propagator and ghost dressing function develop logarithmic divergences when @xmath176 : @xmath177 such divergences exclude the possibility of controlling as strict one - loop calculation as was used above for @xmath0 .",
    "a proper treatment of the @xmath4 case requires a rg approach adapted to the ir regime .    as shown in the appendix [ appendix_suppress ]",
    ", the ir convergence of the loop integrals in @xmath4 does not improve when increasing the order of perturbation theory , as it does for @xmath0 .",
    "this is the typical situation at the upper critical dimension of a model and it is well known that a rg treatment is then necessary to study the ir behavior .",
    "we therefore apply the ir safe scheme described in sect .",
    "[ irsafescheme ] in the @xmath4 case .",
    "the anomalous dimensions read : @xmath178 @xmath179 with @xmath91 . as",
    "before , we can extract from them the @xmath74 functions for the mass and coupling constant . as discussed at the end of sect .",
    "[ sect_ir ] , the leading behavior of the flow of the dimensionless mass is vanishing in @xmath4 . in order to study the ir behavior , it is convenient to consider the following dimensionless combination : @xmath180 whose @xmath74 function takes the form : @xmath181 observe that this @xmath74 function is always negative and therefore leads to a ir landau pole . the only way round would be that @xmath182 would run to zero sufficiently fast when @xmath71 decreases",
    ". however the study of the flow of @xmath141 in the ir is at odds with this hypothesis .",
    "indeed , the @xmath74 function for @xmath183 behaves at small @xmath141 as : @xmath184 which leads to an increase of @xmath141 in the ir .    in conclusion ,",
    "the case @xmath4 is very different from higher dimensions : there is no fixed point and the flow runs to a landau pole .",
    "we relate this first property with the observation that , in @xmath4 and for @xmath185 , the @xmath74 functions for @xmath12 and @xmath141 are proportional ( see eqs .",

    "the two - loop calculation @xcite lifts this degeneracy and yields a fixed point with coupling constants @xmath189 .",
    "it would be interesting to study if the two - loop contributions lift in the same manner the degeneracy of the @xmath74 functions for @xmath126 and @xmath141 .",
    "we have shown in detail that a particular case of the curci - ferrari model , motivated by phenomenological considerations reproduces quantitatively several non - trivial correlation functions of pure gluodynamics in all ranges of momenta .",
    "the result is obtained from a very simple one - loop perturbative calculation and the surprising agreement is justified by estimating the size of higher loop corrections .",
    "moreover , we have proposed an ir - safe rg scheme that does not show a landau pole .",
    "therefore we have at hands a phenomenological model that correctly describes yang - mills correlators .",
    "these results question the common idea that the ir properties of qcd are beyond the scope of perturbation theory .    at the conceptual level",
    ", it would be more satisfying to be able to calculate the mass parameter from first principles and this is probably a non - perturbative and very difficult issue ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "however , once the existence of this mass is accepted , the rest of the analysis seems to be purely perturbative",
    ". the determination of the mass from first principles would be also interesting since it would fix the results in terms of the single parameter appearing in pure ym .",
    "another important open issue is that of the unitarity of the model . a discussed in sect .",
    "ii , usual proofs of unitarity do not work in this model because the nilponcy of the brst symmetry is broken .",
    "the situation is actually common to all schemes beyond the fp procedure , such as the gz model , but it does not unavoidably mean that the model breaks unitarity .",
    "it could be that a procedure permits to reduce the state space down to a physical hilbert space ( where unitarity is recovered ) that would not rely on the nilpotency of the brst operator .",
    "devising such a procedure is an open issue .    beyond these fundamental problems , the evidences that the model considered here is a good and simple phenomenological one opens the way to many applications .",
    "let us mention here some of them .",
    "3-point correlation functions have been measured on the lattice and their calculation is a direct extension of the work presented here and would give another test of the ability of the model to reproduce ym correlation functions .",
    "it would also be interesting to compute the 2-loop contributions to the ghost and gluon propagators , that would in particular give a direct measure of the size of higher order corrections .",
    "the calculation of rg flows and 2-point correlation functions can be easily extended at finite temperature and many thermodynamic properties can be extracted from it",
    ". of great physical interest would be to calculate within this model the quark - antiquark potential in the quenched approximation , although it is hard to believe that confinement would appear in such a simple analysis .",

    "<S> we investigate the 2-point correlation functions of yang - mills theory in the landau gauge by means of a massive extension of the faddeev - popov action . </S>",
    "<S> this model is based on some phenomenological arguments and constraints on the ultraviolet behavior of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the running coupling constant remains finite at all energy scales ( no landau pole ) for @xmath0 and argue that the relevant parameter of perturbation theory is significantly smaller than 1 at all energies . </S>",
    "<S> perturbative results at low orders are therefore expected to be satisfactory and we indeed find a very good agreement between 1-loop correlation functions and the lattice simulations , in 3 and 4 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> dimension 2 is shown to play the role of an upper critical dimension , which explains why the lattice predictions are qualitatively different from those in higher dimensions . </S>"
