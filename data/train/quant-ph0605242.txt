    "the momentum of a photon in a dispersive medium has been considered by many authors , due to its conceptual and practical importance .",
    "one of the issues is how the momentum is conserved when a photon with momentum @xmath4 in the vacuum is scattered from an atom in the medium to a new momentum state @xmath5 in the vacuum .",
    "should the momentum imparted on the atom be the difference of the momenta in the vacuum @xmath6 or the difference of the canonical photon momenta in the medium @xmath7 @xcite ?",
    "one might argue@xcite that , assuming the medium is dilute , the atom is localized in the vacuum space between particles of the medium , therefore the photon , before and after it hits the atom , travels in the vacuum and momentum should be conserved in terms of the vacuum momenta . on the other hand @xcite , one can also argue that it is the macroscopic field of the incident wave that induces and interacts with polarizations and polarization currents of atoms in the medium and therefore the imparted momentum should be the difference of the canonical photon momenta in the medium .  experimentally , this issue has been studied in two systems .",
    "one measures the recoil of a mirror immersed in a liquid when the light is reflected from it @xcite , and more recently @xcite , a measurement of the recoil frequency of the bose condensed @xmath8 using a two - pulse ramsey interferometer .",
    "both experiments confirm that atoms recoil according to canonical photon momenta .",
    "most theoretical studies related to this issue deal mainly with classical fields .",
    "some of the recent work by loudon @xcite and nelson @xcite clarified some issues related to momentum in a dielectric from a quantum and microscopic perspective .",
    "milonni and boyd @xcite consider a case where a source atom imbedded in the medium recoils due to its spontaneous decay .",
    "they find that the source atom recoils according to @xmath9 , where @xmath3 is the atomic frequency and @xmath10 is the speed of light in the vacuum . their calculation is based on a heisenberg picture approach , where the operator expectation value , @xmath11 is calculated to be @xmath12 . here we present a similar calculation in the schrdinger picture .",
    "the calculation in the schrdinger picture is particularly revealing because it includes explicitly processes that are responsible for the modification of the momentum imparted by the photon . as we show in the following , the photon travelling in the medium experiences a series of scatterings from medium atoms .",
    "different scattering amplitudes interfere to shift the central frequency of photons in the field .",
    "since the source atom is coupled directly to the field , by momentum conservation , the source atom recoils according to the modified central frequency of photons .",
    "our calculation is based on a quantum field quantized in the free space , which allows a separate description of the field and the medium , i.e. any wavelength and frequency of the field are calculated unambiguously in the vacuum .",
    "the calculation is based on a model that we have used previously @xcite@xcite .",
    "the source atom , with finite mass @xmath13 centered at position @xmath14 , has two internal levels , whose frequency separation is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the uniformly distributed dielectric atoms have @xmath15 ground states and @xmath16 excited states .",
    "the frequency separation of the ground and excited states is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the mass of the medium atoms to be infinite , which allows us to ignore recoil of the medium atoms . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the source atom is excited to the @xmath19 excited state sublevel with center of mass momentum @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , the dielectric atoms are all in their ground states , and there are no photons in the field .",

    "the medium is modeled to be infinite , i.e. photons are always inside the medium .",
    "the vaccum field amplitudes , the medium atoms excited state amplitudes , and the source atom center of mass motion is caculated as @xmath22 it is assumed that the medium atoms are far detuned from the source atom , @xmath23 and also @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spontaneous decay rate of the source atom .",

    "since the medium atoms are far detuned from the source atom , we include anti - rotating terms in the field - medium atoms interaction .",
    "we have not included such terms for the interaction hamiltonian between the source atom and the field because we have chosen the initial state to be the source atom excited with no photon in the field .    instead of writing amplitude equations for different states and then identifying terms corresponding to contributions from different processes @xcite",
    ", we adopt a resolvent approach @xcite , which allows us to write amplitudes directly from diagrammatic representations of the scattering processes .",
    "we want to calculate the recoil energy of the source atom , which includes the contribution from three amplitudes : the source recoiled atom with one photon in the field , the recoiled source atom with one medium atom excited , and the recoiled source atom with both the field and a medium atom excited .",
