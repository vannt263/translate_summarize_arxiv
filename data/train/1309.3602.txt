    "generally , most of the transient black hole candidates ( bhcs ) show lifqpos ranging between @xmath0 to @xmath1  hz in their power density spectra .",
    "more precisely these qpos are observed during hard and intermediate ( hard - intermediate or soft - intermediate ) spectral states .",
    "our study during the outburst phases of few galactic transient black hole candidates ( for e.g. , gx  339 - 4 , h  1743 - 322 , gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 etc . ) show that during the rising phases qpo frequencies are observed to be increasing monotonically and during declining phases the sources show a monotonically decreasing nature of qpo frequencies .",
    "more precisely from the spectral study , it was noticed that these evolutions of qpo frequency are observed during hard and hard - intermediate spectral states @xcite .",
    "we used rxte / pca data of gro  j1655 - 40 , gx  339 - 4 & h  1743 - 322 outbursts with a maximum timing resolution of @xmath2 to generate power - density spectra ( pds ) , using ",
    "powspec \" task of xronos package of heasoft 6.11 with a normalization factor of ` -2 ' to have the ` white ' noise subtracted _ rms _ fractional variability in @xmath3 kev ( 0 - 35 channels of pcu2 ) light curves of @xmath0  sec time bins . to find centroid frequency of qpos , pds",
    "are fitted with lorentzian profiles .",
    "observations of lifqpos in black hole candidates are reported quite extensively in the literature and at the same time many theoretical or empirical models are introduced to explain this important temporal feature of bhcs .",
    "but one satisfactory model namely shock oscillation model ( som ) by chakrabarti and his collaborators @xcite in mid 90s , shows that the oscillation of x - ray intensity is actually due to the oscillation of the post - shock ( comptonizing ) region . in this som solution , at the rising phase of the outburst , a shock wave moves toward the black hole , and at the declining phase of the outburst , a shock moves away from the black hole , which oscillates either because of a resonance ( where the cooling time of the flow is approximately the infall time ; @xcite ) or because the rankine - hugoniot condition is not satisfied @xcite to form a steady shock .",
    "-0.5 cm      for explaining evolution of the qpo frequency during the rising phase of 2005 gro  j1655 - 40 outburst , chakrabarti and his students @xcite introduced a new model , namely propagating oscillatory shock ( pos ) model . according to pos , the qpo frequency is inversely proportional to the infall time ( @xmath4 ) in post - shock region . for governing equations of pos model , see eq.1 - 3 of chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite . so far , we have studied qpo frequency evolutions during the outbursts of gro  j1655 - 40 ( 2005)@xcite , gx  339 - 4 ( 2010 - 11)@xcite , h  1743 - 322 ( 2010 & 2011)@xcite , and xte  j1550 - 564 ( 1998)@xcite .",
    "these evolutions are well fitted with pos model and from there accretion flow parameters related to evolutions are extracted . here",
    ", we discuss a brief summary of model fitted results obtained from the qpo frequency evolutions of first three sources during their individual x - ray outbursts .      during the rising phase , qpo frequency",

    "was decreased monotonically from @xmath13hz to @xmath14mhz and this evolution was fitted with the same pos model . here , we observed that initially ( upto @xmath15 days ) shock moved very slowly ( from @xmath16 to @xmath8 ) and then rapidly with high acceleration ( on last qpo observed day at @xmath17 ) . during the entire period ,",
    "strength of the shock was kept constant with @xmath18 .",
    "evolution of qpo frequency from @xmath19mhz to @xmath20hz observed during the rising phase of the outburst , where shock was observed to move from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with a constant velocity ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath23 , @xmath11 , and @xmath24 . during the declining phase , qpo frequency",
    "is found to decrease from @xmath25hz to @xmath26hz . according to pos , initial @xmath27",
    "days shock moved away slowly ( from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ) with initial velocity ( @xmath30 ) = @xmath31 and acceleration = @xmath32 .",
    "after that as of gro  j1655 - 40 , shock disappears with higher rate of acceleration ( @xmath33 ) with final velocity ( @xmath34 ) = @xmath35 .      during rising phase of 2010 outburst ,",
    "qpo frequency was increased from @xmath36 to @xmath37hz , with the movement of shock wave from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with @xmath40=1.39 , @xmath41 , and an accelerating velocity , changing from @xmath42 to @xmath43 cm / sec within a period of @xmath44 days .",
    "similarly , during 2011 rising phase , qpo frequency was increased from @xmath45 to @xmath46hz with movement of shock wave from @xmath47 to @xmath48 with the help of an accelerating velocity ( changing @xmath49 - @xmath50 cm / sec ) within a period of @xmath51 days , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . during declining phase of 2010 outburst",

    "similarly , during the 2011 declining phase , shock was found to move from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with an accelerating velocity ( changing @xmath63 - @xmath64 cm / sec ) and constant @xmath65 . as a result qpo frequency",
