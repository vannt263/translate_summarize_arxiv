    "revealing the color field distribution in the nucleon is a subject of fundamental importance to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and confinement .",
    "lattice qcd simulations provide a first principle source of knowledge about how the energy distribution manifests itself among a system of three static quarks ( 3q ) .",
    "this has to do with the relevant ansatz that accurately parametrizes and models the non - abelian force that binds the nucleon .",
    "the color distribution due to a 3q system has been of a problem of reviving interest of lattice simulations and has been revisited with variety of lattice techniques  @xcite . even though , an important aspect of this problem yet remains to be thoroughly investigated .",
    "that is , the energy distribution associated with the 3q system at finite temperature .",
    "tackling the problem of the gluonic distribution from this perspective involves the employment of a methodologically different set of unbiased hadronic operators .",
    "in addition to that , revealing the changes of the gluonic profile of the ( 3q ) system under various temperature conditions would certainly contribute to our perception of the underlying gluonic picture and the associated gluon dynamics .",
    "in fact , the distribution of gluonic fields in the baryon at high temperature , before quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) undergoes a phase transition , is unknown in detail and has not yet been under the scrutiny of the lattice approach .",
    "most of our current understanding of the ( 3q ) confining force is based on the analysis at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization which provides the best possible fits of the lattice data of the measured 3q system potentials has been controversial for a long period of time  @xcite .",
    "however , recent lattice qcd findings regarding the three quark potential are settled to support the so - called @xmath2-ansatz parametrization for small quark separation distances of @xmath4 fm and the y - ansatz for @xmath5 fm  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 ansatz accounts for a confining potential built up as a sum of two - body forces , the string tension is half that in the corresponding @xmath6 system and the confining part of the baryonic potential is in proportion to the perimeter of the triangle set up by the 3q system . on the other hand ,",
    "if the confining potential is proportional to the sum of the distances from the quarks to the fermat point with a string tension the same as that in the @xmath7 system , then due to its shape , this potential is known as the y - ansatz , giving rise to a three - body term relevant to a genuine interaction channel of the non - abelian force .",
    "ambiguities are known to arise , however , in the calculations of the gluonic distribution in the 3q system at zero temperature .",
    "the energy distribution may be vulnerable to systematic errors associated with excited - state contamination  @xcite when constructing the static baryon using a wilson loop operator .",
    "the configuration of the spatial links that best minimize the potential has to be adopted before hand . associated with this arbitrariness in tuning the ground state operator are the excited state potentials which manifest themselves in the revealed gluonic profiles as a bias reflecting the form of spatial links of the wilson loop operator  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 shape baryon operator provides a pronounced evidence where the flux distribution mimics the source  @xcite .",
    "the isolation of the ground state is challenging in the case of field - distribution calculations which involve four - point correlations rather than the ground state potential which is extracted in the large time limit of a three - point correlation  @xcite .",
    "for example , euclidean time evolution in the three quark wilson loop operator results in observable broadening of the junction in the y - shaped configuration  @xcite .",
    "statistical noise , nevertheless , imposes a practical constraint on any further increase in the exponentially decaying operator .    in this investigation ,",
    "the static baryonic states are accounted for by means of polyakov loops .",
    "this provides a gauge invariant operator which acquires a methodological importance  @xcite due to the ability to construct an unbiased 3-quark operator without recoursing to a particular assumption regarding the form of the configuration of the spatial links in wilson loops or the ultraviolet properties of these parallel transporters  @xcite . while carrying out energy density calculations into the zero temperature regime requires substantial numerical simulations with regard to the cpu time as well as the memory storage ,",
    "the use of these stringless hadronic operators for revealing the energy distribution at finite temperature is still an attractive idea from the practical feasibility point of view .",
    "this can be studied in conjunction with the thermal effects .",
    "at finite temperature , pure yang - mills su(3 ) lattice simulations for the action density in the mesonic sector display a flux distribution with a vibrating string - like shape .",
    "the density distribution shows a non - uniform pattern with an almost constant cross section in the intermediate distance region @xmath9 fm and non - constant cross section at larger quark separations  @xcite .",
    "the non - uniformity of the action density coincides with only a small decrease in the @xmath10 effective string tension @xmath11  @xcite suggesting the ground state may also display a non uniform action density distribution  @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize this analysis to the distribution of the color field inside the baryon .",
    "we consider one temperature near the end of the qcd plateau region at @xmath0 , and other just before the deconfinement point at @xmath1 .",
    "the three infinitely heavy quarks are accounted for by means of polyakov loops of the same time orientation .",
    "the field strength inside the corresponding quark system is revealed by correlating an improved action density operator  @xcite to these gauge - invariant hadronic operators .",
    "gauge - field smoothing  @xcite , in addition to a high statistics gauge - independent  @xcite averaging is employed to enhance the signal to the noise .",
    "this noise reduction approach can be employed in a controlled and systematic manner that has been proved effective in keeping the physics intact in the case of the static meson  @xcite .",
    "the analysis on either the @xmath7 force or the action density shows that smearing leaves no effect on the corresponding measurements taken for quark source separation distance scales greater than the diameter of the brownian motion of a diffused link i.e. the characteristic diameter of smearing .",
    "moreover , the systematic effects associated with this uv filtering procedure on the gluonic profile has been reported in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analysis on the smearing effects is revisited in this work for the 3q force .",
    "the relevant distance scale where the physics is preserved is established . after identifying this scale ,",
    "the characteristics of the action density profile are presented for selected 3q configurations and contrasted at the two considered temperatures .",
    "the map of this paper is as follows : in section  [ measurements ] and section  [ statistics ] , the details of the simulations and noise reduction techniques are described .",
    "the force in the 3q system for selected configurations is evaluated in section  [ forces ] . in section  [ act ] , the main aspects of the gluonic profile of the baryonic action density is analyzed and contrasted at the two temperatures . in the last section  [ conc ] , the conclusions are provided .",
    "the infinitely heavy quark state is constructed by means of polyakov loop correlators . in the confinement phase , for pure su(3 ) gauge configurations ,",
    "the correlators respect the center symmetry transformation @xmath12    where center @xmath13 of the gauge group @xmath14 is all the elements @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , with @xmath17 or @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",

    "the action density operator is calculated via a highly - improved @xmath24 three - loop improved lattice field strength tensor  @xcite .",
    "a scalar field that characterizes the gluonic field can be defined as    @xmath25    for baryonic systems , where @xmath26 denotes averaging over configurations and lattice symmetries , the vectors @xmath27 define the positions of the quarks and @xmath28 the position of the flux probe .",
    "cluster decomposition implies @xmath29 away from the quarks .    in this investigation",
    ", we have taken @xmath30 measurements at temperature @xmath31 , and @xmath32 measurements at temperature @xmath33 .",
    "the measurements are taken on hierarchically generated configurations .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated using the standard wilson gauge action on lattices with a spatial volume of @xmath34 .",
    "gauge configurations are generated with a coupling value of @xmath35 .",
    "the lattice spacing at this coupling is @xmath36 fm  @xcite .",

    "these sub measurements are binned together in evaluating eq .  .",
    "the total measurements are taken on 500 bins .",
    "the gluonic gauge configurations are generated with a pseudo - heatbath algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the heatbath is implemented by ( fhkp )  @xcite updating on the corresponding three su(2 ) subgroups .",
    "each update step consists of one heatbath sweep and 4 micro - canonical reflections .",
    "gauge - independent noise reduction can be employed by making use of the space - time translational invariance of the hyper - toroid . by space - translational invariance",
    ", measurements of the action density operator is repeated for each translated polyakov loops correlator .",
    "the measurements are then averaged over the spatial volume of the lattice .",
    "the periodicity in the time direction also allows averaging over the time direction @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of time slices of the lattice .",
    "the symmetry of the quark positions can be also exploited to gain a reduction in the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the flux - distribution has been averaged around all the symmetry planes of a given quark configuration .    local action reduction by smearing the gauge links has been performed on the whole four dimensional lattice . this procedure can be applied for correlating operators with polyakov loops .",
    "for example , the correlations with the topological charge has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using the cabbibo - marinari cooling .",
    "smearing the gauge field can be particularly helpful in reducing the statistical noise associated with evaluating the polyakov loop correlators .",
    "however this step may result in the elimination of short distance physics and one has to be careful with regard to the number of smearing sweeps and the relevant distance scale where the physical observables are extracted . in the next section ,",
    "we study the effects of gauge field smoothing on the 3q force and determine the distance scale and corresponding smearing level where the physical observables are left intact .",
    "we smooth the gauge field with an over - improved stout - link smearing algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the scheme of the over improvement of this algorithm is such that a minimal effect on the topology of the gauge field  @xcite is ensured .    in the standard stout - link smearing  @xcite ,",
    "all the links are simultaneously updated .",
    "each sweep consists of a replacement of all the links by the smeared links , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the sum of the two staples touching @xmath47 which reside in the @xmath48 plane . in the over - improved algorithm , however , the square staple is replaced by a combination of plaquette and rectangular staples .",
    "this ratio is tuned by the parameter @xmath49  @xcite . in the following we use a value of @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .    despite the noise reduction at short distance quark separation , the signal drawn in statistical noise at large distances if one opt merely to the link integration method  @xcite in evaluating the polyakov loops in eq .  .",
    "while the link integration method  @xcite provides efficient noise reduction at small quark separations for the expectation values of polyakov loops in eq .  , noise remains problematic at large separations .",
    "the method is expected to be efficient for the @xmath52 source separation range @xmath53  @xcite but has to be supplemented with a large number of measurements for the calculations of the larger distance @xmath7 potential  @xcite .",
    "the number of measurements has to be increased significantly for the corresponding 3q potential calculations with a three point correlator .",
    "the action density calculations would be , on the other hand , even more challenging in both cases  @xcite .",
    "the exponential reduction of noise provided by the leveling approach of the lscher weiss ( lw ) algorithm requires the hierarchical integration to be carried out over time sub - slices larger than the deconfinement temporal extent @xmath54  @xcite . for the temperatures considered here ,",
    "the division of measurements into binned sub - measurements resembles a one level implementation of the lw method , with updating the last time slice .",
    "unlike the force which is extracted from a three point correlator , the flux characterization eq .  , involves a four - point correlation function in the numerator presenting additional challenges with respect to the signal to noise level .",
    "the lattice space - time and configuration space symmetries can be auxiliary in enhancing the signal to noise ratio , however , a four dimensional gauge smoothing has to be employed to obtain a signal .    the force in the 3q system is a physical observable of direct relevance to the properties of the underlying energy distribution . in the following",
    "we consider the effects of the gauge smoothing procedure on the force experienced by a test color charge .",
    "this can give indications on the relationship between source separation distance and the number of smearing sweeps where the changes in physics is minimal .",

    "each set of data describes how the width of the gluonic flux vary at a given plane @xmath71 for the triangle base as the third quark @xmath59 moves to a larger values of @xmath62 .",
    "evidently , the increase of the temperature dramatically increases the rate of the broadening of the glue at all planes .",
    "apart from the pronounced thermal effects near the deconfinement point , we see the rates of broadening at @xmath72 are decreasing as one proceeds to the more distant planes from the base of the triangle .",
    "moreover , the wider the base of the isosceles triangle , the more pronounced is the corresponding decrease in the width , indicating that the gluonic tend to become more localized as the geometrical area enclosed by the quarks positions becomes larger .",
    "the shrinking of the width of the flux tube is a peculiar property to certain geometrical configurations of the multi - quark system .",
    "the decrease in the width with the increase of the inter - quark separation has never been observed in the meson either using polyakov lines at finite temperature  @xcite or wilson s loop at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the wilson loop based energy distribution at zero temperatures does not seem to indicate shrinking of the width of the flux tube  @xcite .",
    "near the deconfinement point , the broadening of the mean square width , @xmath73 , exhibits a clear linear divergence at distant planes from the base of the isosceles triangle for large separations , @xmath74 fm of the third quark @xmath59 .",
    "this result resembles the observed linear growing in the flux distribution width at the same temperature in the meson  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the growing width at distant planes from the base , @xmath75 , from plane to plane show only subtle changes .",
    "this indicates that the effects of the boundary and the junction fluctuations decays away by proceeding to large quark separations .",

    "the gluonic flux in the 3q system does not exhibit a symmetry between the width measured in the quark plane and that in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this has to do with the underlying gluonic structure and the associated fluctuations .",
    "for example , the string picture indicates an asymmetry in the mean square width between the two planes  @xcite .",
    "we report for completeness the general qualitative features of this ratio of the action density in the two perpendicular planes .",
    "the width of the tube in the perpendicular direction is measured through gaussian fits as    @xmath78    we measure the ratio between the width in the quark plane and that in the perpendicular plane to the quarks    @xmath79    it is interesting to consider this quantity since the predictions of the string model at zero temperature indicate asymmetric width pattern near the junction  @xcite . in a similar way to the characteristics of the flux that we have studied in the previous sections , we plot in fig .",
    "[ asp ] the aspect ratio at the two temperatures for the same quark position configurations .",
    "generally , the value of the aspect ratio indicates that the fluctuations in the quark plane are always larger than the perpendicular fluctuations for both temperatures .",
    "further inspection of fig .",
    "[ asp ] shows only subtle dependence on the temperature for the small isosceles bases .",
    "the aspect ratio is changing slowly as we move through the planes up to the third quark position for the smallest isosceles bases .",
    "however at larger bases , the asymmetry throughout the gluonic cone becomes pronounced .",
    "the results of the aspect ratio are indicating greater restoring forces for the gluonic distribution in the perpendicular direction to the quark plane .",
    "this effect diminishes as we consider planes away from the fermat point of the triangle quark configuration . near the deconfinement point @xmath77",
    ", the aspect ratio increases with the base length showing only a subtle dependency on @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior is reversed at the lower temperature @xmath72 for large quark separation .",
    "indeed we see at @xmath72 , for the bases @xmath69 fm and @xmath70 fm , a decrease in the aspect ratio at all planes with the increase of the third quark separation @xmath74 fm .    within the underlying gluonic picture of three squeezed string - like flux tubes meeting at a junction and assuming a y - shaped form , the predictions of this string model for the ratio of the mean square width of the flux distribution in the quark planes and the perpendicular direction at position of the junction has been worked out in ref  @xcite .",
    "however , one should carefully consider the geometrical aspects of the configuration and take into account any remnant ( @xmath72 ) or pronounced ( @xmath80 ) thermal effects before pursuing a complete confrontation with the predictions of the baryonic bosonic string models .",
    "we included the thermal effects  @xcite into the predictions that have been worked out earlier in ref .",
    "however , this comparison of the lattice data with the predictions of the models lies beyond the scope of the present presentation of the gluonic profile , and will be reported in details elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the flux strength distribution revealed with the action density using the wilson loop does not appear to produce an asymmetric gluonic pattern .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the radius of the tube is calculated with cylindrical coordinates assuming a cylindrical symmetry of the tube .",
    "the analysis provided here for the aspect ratio of the mean - square width provides another distinct feature of the glue , as revealed by polyakov loops rather than a manifestation of temperature effects .",
    "the gluon flux distribution of a three quark system in pure su(3 ) yang - mills vacuum has been revealed at finite temperature .",
    "this analysis is an extension of the calculations of the action density correlations obtained recently for the @xmath52  @xcite system to three quark systems .",
    "the infinitely heavy baryonic state has been constructed by three polyakov loops .",
    "the gluon flux is measured as a correlation between the action density operator and three traced ( gauge - invariant ) polyakov lines .",

    "each bin consists of an average over measurements that are closely spaced in configuration space .",
    "an over - improved version of the stout - link smoothing algorithm has been employed with number of sweeps such that the physics is preserved in a systematic and controlled manner .",
    "we have revealed the characteristics of the flux action - density measured for three sets of geometrical 3-quark configurations and the corresponding changes on the behavior due to the temperature .",
    "each set corresponds to isosceles triangle bases of length @xmath82 fm , @xmath69 fm and @xmath70 fm .",
    "the characteristics of the isosurface , the radius and the amplitude profiles of the action density correlations , in addition to the broadening ( or the shrinking ) pattern of the flux distribution , can be summarized in the following main points :    * a.  the iso - surface *  of the flux action - density displays a family of concave @xmath2 shapes at small as well as large quark separations .",
    "these @xmath2-shaped gluonic distributions persist and do not change into a y - shape as the distances between the quark sources are increased .",
    "the density plots in the quark plane display a nonuniform distribution at all distance separations .",
    "this contrasts the wilson loop results at zero temperature which exhibit uniform action density along each arm of the y - shaped profile .",
    "a remarkable feature of the revealed map of the contour lines of the flux strength is that the shape of the contour lines do not show significant sensitivity to the temperature for the two temperatures considered here . +",
    "* b.  the radius profiles *  give indications on the spread of the energy inside the baryon . at the lowest temperature near the end of the plateau , @xmath72 ,",

    "the distribution s peak ceases localizing around the fermat point of the 3q isosceles configurations when the height , @xmath62 , is greater than @xmath3 fm .",
    "the peak shifts to the outside of the triangle made at @xmath81 and shifts in the reverse direction to the inside of the triangle for @xmath39 . that is the amplitude gets higher when the radius shrinks at @xmath39 and the reverse manifest at @xmath81 .",
    "* d.  the flux mean - square width *  does not always broaden with the increase of the quark source separation as is the case in the meson .",
    "for the lowest temperature , @xmath39 , the flux distribution shrinks in width for large quark separations .",
    "the change in the width of the flux tube shows a non - broadening aspect which is a property of certain configurations of the multi - quark system .",
    "the width , however , grows linearly near the deconfinement point , @xmath81 , with the increase of the height of the triangle .",
    "in general , the slope of the decrease or increase in the width , at both temperatures , depends on the length of the triangle base . the wider the base of the triangle set up by the quarks positions , the lower or higher is the slop at temperatures @xmath72 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "* e.  the aspect ratio * between the mean square width of the flux distribution in the quark plane and the width in the perpendicular plan exhibits an asymmetry .",
    "the gluonic fluctuations in the plane of the quarks are greater than that in the perpendicular directions around fermat point , indicating a greater restoring force for the system in the plane of the quarks .",
    "the ratio between the two components of the mean square width decreases as we consider planes farther than the locus of the fermat point of the quark configuration .",
    "the temperature dependence for the aspect ratio is more pronounced at large quark separations while we see almost the same profiles for small isosceles bases .",
    "the deviation of the aspect ratio from unity is implied by the predictions of the string models and do not manifest using wilson loop operator in the action correlations .",
    "* future work * + as this work presents our first investigation of the flux distribution of the 3q system at finite temperature , there are many promising avenues of investigation remaining . for example , additional quark configurations could be examined in detail .",
    "lower temperatures remain to be investigated .",

    "<S> the action - density delocalizes and the width broadens linearly at large quark separations . </S>"
