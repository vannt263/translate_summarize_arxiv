    "the identification of the limiting distribution of @xmath6 , the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random word of length @xmath7 , whose letters are iid and chosen uniformly from an ordered , @xmath1-letter alphabet , was first made by tracy and widom @xcite .",
    "they showed that the limiting distribution of @xmath6 , properly centered and normalized , is that of the largest eigenvalue of the traceless @xmath8 gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) . in the non - uniform iid case ,",
    "its , tracy , and widom @xcite described the corresponding limiting distribution as that of the largest eigenvalue of one of the diagonal blocks ( corresponding to the highest probability ) in a direct sum of certain independent gue matrices .",
    "the number and respective dimensions of these matrices are determined by the multiplicities of the probabilities of choosing the letters , and the direct sum is subject again to an overall zero - trace type of condition .",
    "the well - known robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) correspondence between sequences and pairs of young tableaux led tracy and widom @xcite to conjecture that the ( necessarily @xmath1-row ) young tableau of a random word generated by an @xmath1-letter , uniform iid sequence has a limiting shape given by the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a @xmath8 traceless element of the gue .",
    "since the length of the longest row of the young tableau is precisely @xmath6 , this appears to be a natural generalization .",
    "johansson @xcite proved this conjecture using orthogonal polynomial methods .",
    "further , okounkov @xcite , and borodin , okounkov , and olshankii @xcite , as well as johansson @xcite , also answered a conjecture of baik , deift , and johansson @xcite regarding the limiting shape of the young tableau associated to a random permutation of @xmath9 . in particular , as @xmath7 grows without bound , the lengths @xmath10 of the first @xmath11 rows of the young tableau , appropriately centered and scaled , have the same limiting law as the @xmath11 largest eigenvalues of a @xmath12 element of the gue , a result first proved , for @xmath13 , in @xcite .",
    "the extension to the non - uniform iid case was addressed to some degree in its , tracy , and widom @xcite , who focused primarily on the top row of the young tableau . here",
    "the obvious conjecture is that the limiting shape has rows whose suitably centered and normalized lengths have a joint distribution which is that of the whole spectrum of the direct sum of gue matrices described above .",
    "below , we prove this result as a special case of the markovian framework .",
    "kuperberg @xcite conjectured that if the word is generated by an irreducible , doubly - stochastic , cyclic markov chain , then the limiting distribution of the shape is still that of the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a traceless @xmath8 element of the gue .",
    "for @xmath4 , this was shown to be true by chistyakov and gtze @xcite , who , in view of further simulations , expressed doubts concerning the validity for @xmath5 . for @xmath3",
    ", we will show that the conjecture holds as well .",
    "however , for @xmath14 , this is no longer the case . indeed , some , but not all , cyclic markov chains lead to a limiting law as in the iid uniform case already obtained by johansson @xcite .",
    "the precise class of homogeneous markov chains with which kuperberg s conjecture is concerned is more specific than the ones we shall study .",
    "the irreducibility of the chain is a basic property we certainly must demand : each letter has to occur at some point following the occurrence of any given letter .",
    "moreover , the doubly - stochastic hypothesis ensures that we have a uniform stationary distribution .",
    "however , the cyclic criterion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the markov transition matrix @xmath15 has entries satisfying @xmath16 , for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) , is more restrictive : cyclicity implies but is not equivalent to @xmath15 being doubly stochastic .",
    "kuperberg was led to introduce this latter restriction via simulations @xcite inspired by mathematical physics considerations , which appear to show that at least some irreducible , doubly - stochastic , _",
    "non-_cyclic markov chains do _ not _ produce such limiting behavior .",
    "let us also note that kuperberg implicitly assumes the markov chain to also be aperiodic .",
    "indeed , the simple @xmath19-state markov chain for the letters @xmath20 and @xmath21 described by @xmath22 for @xmath23 , produces a sequence of alternating letters , so that @xmath6 is always either @xmath24 or @xmath25 , for @xmath7 even , and @xmath26 , for @xmath7 odd , and so has a degenerate limiting distribution . even though this markov chain is irreducible , doubly - stochastic , and cyclic",
    ", it is periodic .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section @xmath19",
    ", we present the simple combinatorial formulation of the @xmath6 problem the authors developed in @xcite .",
    "next , in section @xmath27 , we use this formulation to rederive the two - letter markov case first studied by chistyakov and gtze @xcite . then , in order to extend these results to alphabets of size @xmath28 , we introduce , in section @xmath29 , a slight modification of our original combinatorial development , and so obtain a functional of combinatorial quantities which describes the shape of the entire young tableau with @xmath7 cells , along with a concise expression for the associated asymptotic covariance structure . in section @xmath30 , we apply markovian invariance principles to express the limiting shape of the young tableau as a brownian functional for all irreducible , aperiodic , homogeneous markov chains ( without the cyclic or even the doubly - stochastic constraint . ) using this functional we are then able to answer kuperberg s conjecture . in section @xmath31 , we investigate , in further detail , various symmetries exhibited by the brownian functional . in particular , we clarify the asymptotic covariance structure in the cyclic case , and obtain , for @xmath1 arbitrary , a precise description of the class of cyclic markov chains having the same limiting law as in the uniform iid case . in section @xmath32 , we further explore connections between the various brownian functionals obtained as limiting laws and eigenvalues of random matrices . finally ,",
    "in section @xmath33 , we conclude with a brief discussion of natural extensions and complements to some of the ideas and results presented in the paper .",
    "as in @xcite , one can express @xmath6 in a fundamentally combinatorial manner .",

    "@xmath63 is described by the following transition probabilities between the two states ( which we identify with the two letters @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",

    "next , we note that , for @xmath837 ,    @xmath838    so that @xmath839 , for some constant @xmath840",
    ". substituting this expression into and , writing @xmath841 , we obtain    @xmath842    writing @xmath843 , for any @xmath844 , gives us    @xmath845    in order for @xmath840 to be a real number , the discriminant of the quadratic equation in must satisfy    @xmath846    which leads to the inequality    @xmath847    this inequality , in turn , gives us constraints on @xmath848 .",
    "indeed , the necessary and sufficient condition needed for such a @xmath848 to exist is given by examining the quadratic in @xmath848 in at its extremal point , namely , at @xmath849 .",
    "doing so leads to the condition    @xmath850    or simply ,    @xmath851    since @xmath852 .",
    "the closer that @xmath853 is to @xmath854 , the more similar that the @xmath817 variances must be .",
    "thus , functions as a bound on the variability among these @xmath817 variances .",
    "provided that the variances satisfy , the condition on @xmath848 is given by    @xmath855    now consider the doubly stochastic case , where @xmath856 . applying the general fact that each row of @xmath405 must necessarily sum to zero , we use and to find that , for each @xmath437 ,    @xmath857    so that @xmath858 , for all @xmath437 . substituting @xmath158 back into gives us    @xmath859    so that @xmath860 .",
    "this then implies that @xmath861 and @xmath862 , for all @xmath437 , @xmath863 .",
    "but this is precisely a permutation - symmetric covariance matrix , which in the iid case corresponds to the class of markov chains having a uniform stationary distribution .",

    "the size of each block depends upon the multiplicity of the corresponding stationary probability .",
    "in addition , there is a zero - trace condition involving the stationary probabilities on the composite matrix .    as a first step in extending these connections between brownian functionals and spectra of random matrices ,",
    "recall the general case when the stationary probabilities are all distinct ( see remark [ rmtconnect ] ) .",
    "our brownian functionals then have no true maximal terms , so that the limiting shape , @xmath600 is simply multivariate normal , with covariance matrix @xmath405 ( or , more precisely , the matrix obtained by permuting the rows and columns of @xmath405 using @xmath392 , the permutation of @xmath324 previously defined ) .",
    "trivially , this limiting law corresponds to the spectrum of a diagonal matrix whose elements are multivariate normal with the same covariance matrix @xmath405 .",
    "we can see that this general result is consistent with the non - uniform iid case having distinct probabilities .",
    "indeed , each block is of size @xmath85 , and is rescaled so that the variance is @xmath870 , for @xmath871 . because of this rescaling , instead of having a generalized zero - trace condition , as in the non - rescaled matrices used in @xcite , our condition is rather a true zero - trace condition",
    "this zero - trace condition is clear , since the covariance matrix for _ any _ iid case ( uniform and non - uniform alike ) is that of a multinomial distribution with parameters @xmath872 , and any @xmath873 having such a distribution of course satisfies @xmath874 , so that @xmath875 , which implies the zero - trace condition for @xmath600 .",

    "let the @xmath216 submatrix @xmath894 of @xmath405 be written as    @xmath895    then    @xmath896    we simplify , by introducing new brownian motions and then decomposing the resulting expression into two independent parts .",
    "to do so , begin by defining the new variances and correlation coefficients @xmath897 , @xmath898 , and @xmath899 .",

    "introducing the brownian functional    @xmath906    @xmath907 , and using @xmath908 , and @xmath234 above , becomes    @xmath909    where @xmath220 is a standard normal random variable independent of the sigma - field generated by @xmath910 .",
    "turning now to the eigenvalues distributions , we first consider the centered , multivariate normal random variables @xmath911 , having covariance matrix    @xmath912    and let @xmath913 and @xmath914 be two iid , centered , normal random variables , independent of @xmath911 , with variance @xmath915 .",
    "then it is classical that    @xmath916    or , equivalently ,    @xmath917    where @xmath918 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath919 , @xmath907 , is defined in terms of @xmath918 , rather than in terms of @xmath910 , as in . then consider the random variable    @xmath920    using , and noting that the variance of the first term in is @xmath905 , it is easy to see that    @xmath921    where @xmath220 is a standard normal random variable independent of @xmath918 .",

    "let @xmath937 be a sequence of positive numbers decreasing to zero .",
    "then it is possible to find an increasing sequence of integers @xmath938 so that , for each @xmath11 , there is a markov chain on @xmath939 letters such that :    the maximal stationary probability @xmath940 is of multiplicity @xmath27 , and    the @xmath941 covariance submatrix @xmath942 governing the associated brownian functional @xmath943 is of the form    @xmath944    that is , the variance of @xmath945 becomes arbitrarily large in comparison to that of @xmath946 and @xmath947 .",
    "then , since @xmath948 , we have , as @xmath81 ,    @xmath949    so that , as @xmath91 ,    @xmath950    where @xmath168 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "the right - hand side of is known as the _ local score _ , and describes the largest positive increase that @xmath918 makes within the unit interval .",
    "such functionals are of great importance in sequence comparison , particularly in bioinformatics ( _ e.g. _ , see daudin , ettienne , and vallois @xcite . )",
    "moreover , @xmath951    which follows immediately from the classical equality in law , due to lvy , @xmath952 . thus , if we have a random matrix connection to @xmath943 , we can extend it to @xmath953 , at least in some limiting sense .",
    "this is also interesting from the following point of view .",
    "classically , the brownian functional @xmath954 , and a trivial random matrix connection can be seen by examining the eigenvalues of the random matrix    @xmath955    where @xmath220 is a standard normal random variable . then , clearly , @xmath956 has the half - normal law , since @xmath957 .",
    "thus , the functional @xmath958 has a random matrix interpretation , one which is considerably simpler than any potential random matrix interpretation for @xmath953 .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained the limiting shape of young tableaux generated by an aperiodic , irreducible , homogeneous markov chain on a finite state alphabet .",
    "the following remarks indicate natural directions in which our results in some cases can , and in other cases , may hope to , be extended .",
    "+ our limiting theorems have all been proved assuming that the initial distribution is the stationary one . however , such results as theorem 2 of derriennic and lin @xcite allow to extend our framework to initial distributions started at a specified state .",
    "indeed , in this case , _",
    "i.e. , _ if for some @xmath959 , @xmath960 , the asymptotic covariance matrix is still given by , and , for example , theorem [ thm4 ] remains valid .",
    "for an arbitrary initial distribution , what is needed in this non - stationary context is an invariance principle .",
    "more generally , our results continue to hold for @xmath961-order markov chains , and in fact , they extend to _ any _ sequence for which both an asymptotic covariance matrix and an invariance principle exist . + our limiting theorems have only been proved for finite alphabets",
    ". however , from the authors previous work @xcite , it is known that for countably infinite iid alphabets , @xmath6 has a limiting law corresponding to that of a non - uniform , finite - alphabet .",
    "hence , for a countably infinite - alphabet markov chain ( subject to additional constraints such as harris recurrence ? ) , we might still be able to obtain limiting laws of the form developed in this paper .",
    "+ by using appropriate existing concentration inequalities , one can expect to establish the convergence of the moments of the rows of the tableaux .",
    "+ one field in which the connection between brownian functionals and random matrix theory has been exploited is in queuing theory .",
    "the development below , following oconnell and yor @xcite , shows how brownian functionals of the sort we have studied arise as generalizations of standard queuing models .",
    "let @xmath962 $ ] and @xmath963 $ ] , @xmath964 , be two independent poisson point process on @xmath965 , with intensity measures @xmath966 and @xmath967 , respectively , with @xmath968 . here",
    "@xmath969 represents the _ arrivals _ process , and @xmath290 the _ service time _ process , at a queue consisting of a single server .",
    "the condition @xmath970 ensures that the _ queue length _          which is simply the number of arrivals during @xmath974 $ ] less the change in the queue length during @xmath974 $ ] , the classical problem is to determine the distribution of @xmath975 $ ] . the answer to this problem",
    "is given by _",
    "burke s theorem _",
    "@xcite ( see theorem @xmath85 of @xcite ) :      that is , @xmath766 has the same law as the arrivals process @xmath969 .",
    "moreover , since , the queue length after time @xmath144 is independent of the process @xmath766 up to time @xmath144 , one may take the departures from the first queue and use them as inputs to a second queue , and observe that the departure process from the second queue also has the law of @xmath969 . proceeding in this way ,",
    "one generalizes to a _",
    "tandem queue _ of @xmath7 servers , each taking the departures from the previous queue as its arrivals process .",
    "one can further generalize this model to a _",
    "brownian queue in tandem _ in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath978 be independent , standard brownian motions on @xmath965 , and write @xmath979 , for each @xmath11 and @xmath980 , and similarly for @xmath918 .",
    "let @xmath981 be a constant , and define , in complete analogy to and ,                  here @xmath918 is the arrivals process for the first queue , @xmath987 is the arrivals process for the @xmath961 queue ( @xmath988 , and @xmath989 is the service process for the @xmath961 queue , for all @xmath11 . using the ideas employed in burke s theorem , it can be shown that the generalized queue lengths @xmath990 are iid random variables .",
    "moreover , they are exponentially distributed with mean @xmath464 .                where the functional @xmath994 is as in theorem [ thm4 ] , with associated @xmath12 covariance matrix @xmath995 and parameter set @xmath996 .",
