    "relativistic heavy ion collisions at the rhic and lhc have produced a very hot and dense pocket of nuclear matter , known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "many experimental studies have been done in order to characterize the important properties of such matter produced under extreme conditions of temperature and density .",
    "the transport coefficients for strongly interacting matter are essential theoretical inputs for hydrodynamic evolution that are critical tools to analyze the heavy ion collision data @xcite . in relativistic hydrodynamic simulations the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients influence various observables like the flow coefficients , the transverse momentum distribution of produced particles . indeed , a finite but very small shear viscosity to entropy ratio ( @xmath2 ) was necessary to explain elliptic flow data that stimulated extensive theoretical studies of this ratio for strongly interacting matter .",
    "the transport coefficient viz . shear viscosity ( @xmath3 ) , in principle , can be estimated directly using the kubo formulation  @xcite .",
    "however , given that qcd is strongly coupled for energies accessible in heavy ion collision experiments , this task is complicated .",
    "further , lattice simulations at finite chemical potentials have been challenging and are limited only to small baryon chemical potential . this has lead to attempts to estimate shear viscosity in various effective models  @xcite involving different approximation schemes .",
    "these include relaxation time approximations to the boltzmann equation  @xcite , kubo formalism of evaluating equilibrium correlation functions  @xcite , transport simulation of boltzmann equation  @xcite , the perturbative qcd methods  @xcite , as well as lattice methods  @xcite .",
    "another key transport coefficient is the electrical conductivity ( @xmath4 ) of the strongly interacting matter .",
    "this enters in the hydrodynamic evolution of quark gluon matter where charge relaxation also plays an important role .",
    "it is also observed that the electrical conductivity of qgp influences significantly the soft photon production through a realistic hydrodynamic simulation  @xcite as well as in low mass dilepton enhancement  @xcite .",
    "further , it also suggested that the electrical conductivity can be extracted from charge dependent flow parameters from asymmetric heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal static electric conductivity @xmath4 represents the linear response of the electrically charged particle diffusion current density @xmath5 to an applied external electric field @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 . after evaluating the induced electric current one can calculate the proportionality coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "electrical conductivity can be derived from the green - kubo formula and is related to the correlation function for a system in thermal equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that very strong electric and magnetic field is created in non - central heavy ion collision at the rhic and lhc in the early stage ( 1 - 2 fm / c ) of the collision  @xcite .",
    "the produced large electrical field affects the medium and its effect depends on the @xmath8 of the medium .",
    "electrical conductivity is responsible for the production of electric current in the early stage of the collision .",
    "it is of fundamental importance for the strength of chiral magnetic effect  @xcite , a signature of cp - violation of the strong interaction .",
    "recently , electric conductivity has been studied by different groups  @xcite .",
    "it is related to the soft dilepton production rate  @xcite and the magnetic field diffusion in the medium  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 helps us to compare the effective cross sections of a medium s constituents among several theories , including lattice gauge theory  @xcite , transport models  @xcite , and dyson - schwinger calculations @xcite .",
    "it can also be computed on the lattice from the correlation function .",
    "thus , the study of transport coefficients is of great interest to measure the properties of strongly interacting matter .",
    "one of the important observations of hics is that the parton system generated at the early stage of the collisions has a strong anisotropy in momentum space due to the different expanding rate of the longitudinal and transverse directions  @xcite . in hics",
    "the longitudinal expansion is much faster than the transverse expansion , which causes the medium to become much colder in the longitudinal direction than the transverse direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 and a local momentum anisotropy appears @xcite .",
    "anisotropy causes the parton system produced to be unstable with respect to the chromomagnetic plasma modes  @xcite that facilitate one to isotropize the system  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the study of anisotropic plasma has received much interest due to the fact that the qgp , which has a local momentum - space anisotropy , is subject to the chromo - weibel instability @xcite .",
    "the effects of these instabilities are not very clear , but they are very important for the qgp evolution at the rhic or lhc . in recent years , the effect of anisotropy has also been studied to investigate the properties of quarkonium states  @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to study its effects on the properties of the qgp system .",
    "thus , it is important to include the momentum - space anisotropic effects in the calculation of transport coefficients .    in this context",
    "the ratio @xmath11 has gained attention recently in the heavy ion phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "it is quite natural to expect that qgp is a good conductor due to deconfinement of the color charges .",
    "but a small value of the ratio @xmath2 indicates large scattering rates that can largely damp the conductivity especially due to chargeless gluons .",
    "our main purpose in this work is to estimate the ratio @xmath11 for the isotropic as well as anisotropic qgp phase by solving a boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation ( rta ) .",
    "we use the quasiparticle model @xcite , which provides a reasonable transport and thermodynamical behavior of the qgp phase .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .",
