    "understanding the phenomena close to quantum critical points ( qcps ) is one of the major challenges in condensed matter physics .",
    "a qcp emerges when the characteristic temperature of a system , e.g. the nel temperature , is suppressed to zero by variation of a non - thermal parameter @xmath1 like pressure , magnetic field or doping . upon pressure - tuning a system towards a qcp ,",
    "the grneisen ratio @xmath2 is expected to display singular behavior , namely a divergence towards zero - temperature , while by tuning a system by magnetic field towards quantum criticality @xmath3 , as defined below , diverges.@xcite both grneisen parameters consist of ratios of the control - parameter and temperature derivatives of the entropy , which is accumulated close to the qcp ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the entropy , volume thermal expansion , specific heat and magnetization , respectively ) : @xmath8    indeed , both @xmath2 and @xmath9 have been experimentally shown to diverge in materials near qcps.@xcite since the magnetic field , in contrast to pressure or doping , can easily be tuned continuously in - situ , the magnetic grneisen ratio is ideally suited to investigate the nature of qcps .",
    "so far , the magnetic grneisen ratio close to qcps has been determined only indirectly by calculation from magnetization and specific heat data@xcite .",
    "note , that @xmath9 can be determined by a single measurement of the magnetocaloric ( mce ) effect , @xmath10 , as shown above .",
    "very recently , the field - dependence of the entropy close to a qcp has been calculated from highly non - adiabatic ( quasi isothermal ) @xmath11 traces , separating the effect of heat flow from / to the bath and the magnetocaloric effect of the sample , using independent measurements of the thermal conductance between sample and bath.@xcite however , a more direct measurement of the mce under truly adiabatic conditions is highly desired for comparison with theoretical scenarios .",
    "below , we show that the alternating - field technique is suitable for this purpose .",
    "previously , the spin - flip transition in insulating gdvo@xmath12 has been investigated using such technique down to 0.5  k.@xcite in this study not much care has been taken on the absolute values of the mce and eddy current heating plays no role , since the material is an electrical insulator .",
    "below , we report the application of the low - frequency alternating - field technique to clean metals and down to mk temperatures .",
    "we carefully investigate the effect of eddy current heating .",
    "furthermore , we prove by comparison with magnetization and specific heat measurements , that accurate absolute values of the adiabatic mce under are obtained .",
    "the definition of the mce implies that a change of the sample temperature @xmath13 caused by a small change of the magnetic field @xmath14 under adiabatic conditions needs to be detected .",
    "below , we demonstrate how the mce could be detected directly by applying a low - frequency alternating field , @xmath15 , and detecting the temperature oscillation of the sample with the same frequency , @xmath16 $ ] ( @xmath17 is a small delay due to the thermal resistance between the sample and thermometer ) .    our setup for generating the alternating field is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a sr830 lock - in amplifier ( stanford research systems ) is used to produce a current with low frequency ( typically 0.01@xmath180.1hz , the choice of the frequency will be discussed later ) .",
    "the current is amplified by a kepco bipolar power amplifier up to 8a and sent through a modulation coil ( 8a current corresponds to 25mt ) which is inserted to the main superconducting magnet and cooled within the liquid 4-he .",
    "the current is determined by measuring the voltage across a shunt resistance ( 4m@xmath19 ) with a keithley 195a multimeter .",
    "the modulation field is superimposed to the desired static magnetic field of interest which is generated by a large superconducting magnet .",
    "note , that a finite static magnetic field is required since the mce depends on the magnetization of the system ( cf .",

    "figure 2 shows the setup to detect the sample temperature under quasi - adiabatic conditions .",
    "the sample is glued on a thin sapphire plate and is cooled or heated through the weak thermal link ( thin cuni wire ) . if @xmath20 denotes the thermal relaxation through the link , the frequency of the field modulation must be adjusted such that @xmath21 in order to obtain quasi - adiabatic conditions .",
    "such adjustment is easily be performed at several different temperatures by taking temperature traces with differing frequency and calculation of the mce ( see below ) .",
    "if the mce is frequency independent , the measurements are performed under quasi - adiabatic conditions .",
    "the ruo@xmath22 resistive thermometer is glued on the sample and its leads are made from superconducting filaments to avoid an additional heat leak .",
    "the sample temperature is measured using a ls370 resistance bridge ( lake shore ) .",
    "the heat sink is weakly coupled to the mixing chamber and its temperature is pid controlled with a heater within the field - compensated region of the large superconducting magnet . in a typical measurement of the temperature dependence of the mce , we slowly sweep the temperature of the heat sink leading to a slow sweep of the average sample temperature . due to the alternating magnetic field",
    ", the sample temperature oscillates through its average value .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation gives the mec @xmath9 , while the average value determines @xmath23 .",
    "schematic view of the platform used for alternating field magnetocaloric effect measurements under quasi - adiabatic conditions . ]",
    "figure  3 shows a typical example of a temperature sweep during an alternating field mce measurement . we have chosen ybrh@xmath22si@xmath22 as this is a system close to a qcp , at which a pronounced divergence of the magnetic grneisen ratio has been observed.@xcite the data discussed here are obtained on a slightly fe - doped single crystal of 20.1 mg mass in a shape of plate with a thickness of 0.25 mm ( residual resistivity ratio @xmath1812@xcite ) . a relatively large piece of single crystal was chosen to determine precisely its magnetization and specific heat , which we will discuss later .",
    "the field was applied within the easy magnetic plane of the system ( parallel to the plane of the sample plate ) , which is perpendicular to the tetragonal @xmath24-axis .",
    "the static field is set to 50mt which is the critical field for undoped ybrh@xmath22si@xmath22 and the alternating field has an amplitude of 4.5mt with frequency of 0.1hz .",
    "a clear oscillation of the sample temperature due to the mce is resolved .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) displays the temperature variation on a larger time scale such that individual oscillations could not be resolved . here",
    "the thickness of the line is a measure of the oscillation amplitude . indeed",
    "the thickness of the @xmath25 trace increases as temperature is decreased , indicating a larger temperature oscillation @xmath26 with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is a clear evidence of quantum criticality in this material , since @xmath26 is expected to decrease linearly with decreasing temperature for a non - critical material with constant magnetic grneisen ratio @xmath27 .",
    "( color online ) sample temperature ( a ) and magnetic field ( b ) vs time for a measurement on doped ybrh@xmath22si@xmath22 .",
    "the red solid and dotted lines show a fit to @xmath28 and its background term , @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the inset displays the temperature variation of the sample over a longer time scale . ]    in order to quantify the mce at a given average temperature @xmath30 , we chose time intervals of five periods ( 5@xmath31 seconds in time ) and determine the amplitude of the temperature oscillation by fitting the temperature trace to @xmath32 ( red solid line in fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , where @xmath33 is the frequency of the field modulation @xmath34 .",
    "the second order polynomial in time ( @xmath29 , cf .",
    "red dotted line in fig .",
    "3(a ) ) is added to the fitting function to take into account the background temperature drift due to the slow sweep of the heat sink temperature .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature oscillation @xmath35 divided by the field modulation amplitude @xmath36 gives the mce .",
    "this value is associated to the average temperature @xmath30 given by the background temperature at the center of the time interval , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the time of the first data point for fitting .",
    "the magnetic grneisen ratio is then calculated by @xmath39 . by shifting the fitting interval across the temperature trace a dense and continuous curve of @xmath9",
    "is obtained , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this measurement from 3  k down to 0.3  k , the temperature of the heat sink was slowly decreased , using pid control , and below 0.3k the heater for the heat sink was turned off , since the thermal conductance of the thermal link is very small at low temperatures , and thus , the decrease of the average sample temperature is very slow .",
    "we have also performed a measurement with half value of the frequency ( @xmath33=0.05hz ) and the same @xmath36 in the entire temperature range from 3 to 60mk , using the same cooling rate of the heat sink , and confirmed that the result is exactly the same .",
    "this proves that the measurement is taken under effective adiabatic conditions ( @xmath21 ; i.e. , heat flow between sample and heat sink within one period is negligible . ) .",
    "the data are compared with @xmath40 calculated using eq . 1 from magnetization and specific heat data  @xcite taken at the same field of 0.05  t and measured using the same piece of single crystal .",
    "the excellent agreement between the two independent ways to obtain the magnetic grneisen ratio prove that this technique is best - suited to quantitatively obtain the true adiabatic mce .",
    "furthermore , the comparison shows the extraordinarily high resolution of the alternating field technique .    magnetic grneisen ratio for yb(rh@xmath41fe@xmath42)@xmath22si@xmath22 as a function of temperature .",
    "the open circles are determined by the alternating field technique while the solid squares are calculated from magnetization and specific heat data using @xmath43 . ]    at last we discuss the problem of joule heating caused by the field modulation .",
    "if the sample is very clean and the mean free path of the electrons is rather high , the frequency and the amplitude of alternating field have to be low to avoid joule heating due to eddy currents .",
    "figure  5 shows data obtained in the normal state of a high - quality single crystal of the clean heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath44 in magnetic field applied parallel to c - axis .",
    "note here that the material has a very large electronic mean free path of 810@xcite and alternating - field is applied perpendicular to the plane of a platelet sample ( 1.3@xmath451.1@xmath450.33mm@xmath46 ) with a twice larger frequency of 0.2hz than the one used for fe - doped ybrh@xmath22si@xmath22 .",
    "this condition causes a severe problem with eddy current heating . as clearly seen in fig .  5 , the temperature of the sample oscillates with twice the frequency of the field modulation which is due to joule heating .",
    "eddy currents induced by the variation of a magnetic field are proportional to the time derivative of the field , @xmath47 .",
    "since eddy current heating is proportional to the square of the current , @xmath48 $ ] , it results in an oscillation with @xmath49 frequency .",
    "note that the heating effect has two components ; constant and 2@xmath33-oscillating ones .",
    "figure  5 also shows that as soon as the alternating field is turned on , the average sample temperature raises immediately due to the constant heating component , followed by the 2@xmath33-oscillation .",
    "we have also verified that the amplitude of @xmath49 component increases rapidly with amplitude @xmath36 and frequency of the alternating field , whereas the @xmath50 component due to the intrinsic mce remains constant .",
    "the eddy current heating can very effectively be suppressed by a reduction of the cross - section of the sample perpendicular to the field axis and as well as by reducing the frequency and/or amplitude of the field modulation .",
    "sample temperature ( a ) and magnetic field ( b ) vs time for a high - quality single crystal of cecoin@xmath44 for @xmath51[001 ] .",
    "note that the temperature oscillation has twice the frequency of the field modulation . ]    at an elevated temperature , where the electrical conductivity is smaller , and therefore , the eddy current heating is less severe , a mixture of intrinsic 1@xmath33 and extrinsic 2@xmath33 oscillations can be found , as shown in fig .",
    "the temperature as a function of time is well fitted by a function with two oscillating components , @xmath52 ( red line in fig .",
    "we deduced @xmath35 , using several different frequencies but the same @xmath36 and found a constant @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that the obtained @xmath35 is still valid under the influence of eddy current heating .",

    "we developed a high - resolution low - temperature alternating - field technique for quasi - adiabatic measurements of the mce and magnetic grneisen ratio for clean metallic samples down to mk temperatures and in large magnetic fields .",
    "the performance check has revealed excellent agreement with the magnetic grneisen ratio calculated by magnetization and specific heat measurements .",
    "the main advantages of the new technique compared to the latter are that it is much faster and easier and that its resolution is much higher .",
