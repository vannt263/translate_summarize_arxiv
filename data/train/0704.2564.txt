    "our environment is pervaded by large - scale complex systems , rooted in different backgrounds : sociology , decision - making , economy , transportation , ecology , regulation and transport in biology , information transfer , and so on @xcite .",
    "the major characteristic of these systems is that they do not have any regular structure , and they exist over complex networks .",
    "characterizing these networks is a nontrivial task , and finding the most important quantities to classify the static structure of them has been intensely researched .",
    "recent research on networks has shifted the focus from the structural ( topological ) analysis to the study of processes ( dynamics ) on these complex networks @xcite .",
    "one of the most common phenomena that occur in a large number of processes is diffusion , where the flow across the links , and consequently , the rate of change of a generalized density at a given node , is driven by the local density gradients between the nodes and its neighbors .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the properties of the diffusion and the related diffusion - operator ( or laplace - operator ) on these networks . in our work , besides the results , we present a technique , based on impurity - averaged perturbation theory , which gives a novel tool to study processes on networks especially _ small - world _ networks .    first introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite ,",
    "small - world networks were constructed to model social interactions @xcite . in the original construction , on a regular lattice",
    ", each node is connected to @xmath0 nearest neighbors , then each link of a node is rewired to a randomly chosen node with probability @xmath1 .",
    "changing the value of @xmath1 , one can interpolate between a regular ( @xmath2 ) and a completely random , erds - rnyi , network ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the original construction of watts and strogatz was difficult to treat mathematically so a new construction was suggested @xcite combining two networks : a regular @xmath4-dimensional one , and on the top of that an erds - rnyi network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_2d ] ) with parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to this construction as the `` _ plain _ '' sw network in order to distinguish it from power - law sw networks , defined later .",
    "well known classical models ( originally defined on regular lattices ) have been studied on these networks , such as the ising model @xcite , the xy model @xcite , diffusion @xcite , and synchronization @xcite .",

    "on top of a regular @xmath4-dimensional lattice , the random long - range links have a _ distance - dependent power - law probability distribution _",
    ", where the probability of two nodes being connected is give by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the euclidean distance between the two nodes in the original regular lattice , @xmath7 is the strength of the distance - dependent suppression of the random long - range links , and @xmath1 is the density of such long - range links ( i.e. , @xmath1 is the average number of random links on a node . )",
    "@xmath8 is the normalization - factor of the distribution @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the linear size of the @xmath4-dimensional lattice .",
    "both the structure of these networks @xcite and diffusive dynamics on these networks @xcite have been studied by others , in one dimension .",
    "our results provides a detailed exploration of the phase diagram in diffusion processes as the connection topology interpolates between the original `` plain '' sw ( @xmath11 ) and the purely short - range connected ( @xmath12 ) network .",
    "one expects that when the probability of the random links decays rapidly enough ( @xmath13 ) , the large scale behavior of the processes on them is not affected by these links .",
    "when the probability of the random links decays slowly ( @xmath14 ) , the results of the original sw network should be recovered @xcite . in between",
    ", there is a transition which is the focus of this paper .",
    "our starting point is a calculation on rapidly - updated networks which turns out to be the first - order approximation of a naive perturbation expansion for the quenched system . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "this expansion breaks down and we apply a self - consistent calculation .    earlier numerical work @xcite for @xmath15 , in the context of the random - walk , suggested that a crossover from the transient to the recurrent phase occurs at around @xmath16 .",
    "here , we compute the asymptotic scaling properties of the propagator analytically ( and confirm it numerically in @xmath15 ) , and precisely construct the full phase diagram for all @xmath4 .",
    "this work provides a detailed account of the self - consistent perturbative approach , briefly introduced in refs . @xcite and @xcite , and expanded numerical results .    in our research",
    "we will consider different diffusion - driven processes , defined in the following sections , _ on _ these networks .",
    "two different cases will be distinguished : the _ rapidly - updated _ network , when the rearrangement of the random links on the network takes place on a timescale much faster than the process itself , and the _ quenched _ network , when the random links can be considered static with respect to the timescale of the process . in the network literature ,",
    "the first case of rapidly - updated networks is often referred to as _ annealed _ networks , and we will refer to them as annealed in this manuscript also . we will denote the annealed average of a quantity by @xmath17^{ann}$ ] and the quenched average by @xmath17 $ ] . in many cases , in the quenched system , the effect of the random long - range links can be understood by a general criterion @xcite , based on averaging over the long - range links in a mean - field ( or annealed ) fashion ( see section [ ch : ann ] . ) .",
    "for a few models , this criterion is violated , leading to non - mean - field behavior such as diffusion on a small - world network with a one - dimensional spatial structure .",
    "such a power - law sw network can emerge in a randomly - folded polymer where , besides the one - dimensional chain of the monomers , two distant monomers can be adjacent to each other , facilitating random long - range links , because of the spatial conformation of the polymer @xcite . for example , in three dimensions , for an ideal chain , the probability of two distant sites to be adjacent is proportional to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance of the two segments , while for a polymer chain in a good solvent , this probability is proportional to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "note , that in the case of small - world networks generated by such polymer configurations , the random links are correlated : there is a high chance to find an other long - range link around an existing one of the same length scale . in the case of annealed networks ,",
    "these correlations are `` washed away '' by the constant rearrangements of the links but , in the quenched case , the correlations can change the universal , large scale , behavior of the processes on them .",
    "in our study , we will deal with uncorrelated random links and leave the correlated case for further research .",
    "another field where such structure can emerge is that of synchronization problems in distributed computing @xcite where synchronization is achieved by introducing random communications between distant processors . choosing a power - law sw network may be preferable as it lowers the cost associated with communications .",
    "it was also argued that `` wiring - cost '' considerations @xcite for spatially embedded networks , such as cortical networks @xcite or on - chip logic networks @xcite , can generate such power - law suppressed link - length distribution . in general , wiring cost in sw networks can result to the introduction of power - law sw networks @xcite .",
    "one case in which the diffusion equation arises on a pl - sw network is a macromolecule randomly moving along a polymer chain jumping over adjacent segments with nonzero probability @xcite ; if the macromolecule motion is fast compared to rearrangements of the links , then the network may be considered as quenched , while if the macromolecule motion is slow compared to the link rearrangements then the network is annealed @xcite .",
    "the equation describing random walk processes is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the probability of finding the walker at site @xmath23 at time @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the relative _ transition rate _ through the random links .",
    "above we have used that the diffusion operator @xmath26 on sw networks , embedded in regular @xmath4-dimensional networks , can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the regular @xmath4-dimensional laplace operator on the underlying lattice , @xmath26 is the laplacian on the random part of the network , and @xmath25 is the relative strength of the relaxation through the random links .",
    "for example , in one dimension , @xmath29 .",
    "the diffusion through the random links is @xmath30 where @xmath31 if there is a random long - range link connecting sites @xmath32 and @xmath23 . for pl - sw networks",

    "because the diffusion equation has only a first - order time derivative , formally its solution can be written as @xmath43 using the spectral decomposition of the diffusion operator one obtains @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the projector to the subspace of @xmath35 .",
    "it is often useful to introduce the laplace transform of the green s function , @xmath46 .",
    "performing the integration over the time domain , one finds @xmath47    in order to characterize the diffusion process on different networks , one of our focuses is on the scaling properties of the _ expected number of returns _ of the random walker by time @xmath48 . for one node at site @xmath32",
    ", it is defined as @xmath49 averaging over all nodes in the network one then has @xmath50 we are interested in its long - time behavior in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a random - walk process is called _ recurrent _ if in an infinite system , the expected number of returns is infinite as @xmath51 and @xmath52 if , on average , the walker visits the origin only finite number of times . using the spectral decomposition of @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) , one obtains @xmath54 the above form is useful for exact numerical calculations for a given realization of the network .    to analytically extract the leading - order asymptotic scaling properties for @xmath55 , instead of the sharp cutoff , it is sufficient to use a kernel that suppresses the integrand for @xmath56 . to make our calculation easier",
    ", we chose @xmath57 @xcite . from the spectral decomposition of the green s function , and repeating the same steps as above , now for the exponential cutoff , one finds @xmath58 in order to make the formalism similar to that of the other phenomena described in this section , let us introduce a modified gf , @xmath59 it is basically the gf defined in the space orthogonal to the uniform zero mode . note that , in the next section , defining the gf in this subspace will be necessary because the coupling matrix is non - invertible . in terms of this",
    "modified gf @xmath60      in this section , we motivate the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) process @xcite on networks , which can be thought of in terms of a synchronization paradigm in a noisy environment .",
    "consider a distributed task - processing network , where the processing nodes , in order to schedule and perform new tasks , must _ wait _ for the results delivered by other nodes .",
    "this task - dependency between nodes correspond to the links , which in general , can be asymmetric or directed , quenched or time - dependent .",
    "examples include distributed - computing systems @xcite , manufacturing supply chains , or e - commerce - based services facilitated by interconnected servers @xcite .",
    "understanding the scaling behavior of the fluctuations in our model will help us better understand the generic features of delays and back - log formation in large - scale networked processing systems",
    ". in particular , for certain distributed computing schemes ( parallel discrete - event simulations ) @xcite , it was shown @xcite that on regular grids , the evolution of the task - completion ( or synchronization ) landscape is governed by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite equation .",
    "the resulting landscape is  rough \" , corresponding to a large spread in the locally - completed tasks on different nodes . in general",
    ", the width provides a sensitive measure of the average degree of de - synchronization in task - completion networks , @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the local progress on node @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the mean progress , and @xmath65 is the number of processing nodes in the system . when the network has an underlying @xmath4-dimensional structure with linear size @xmath10 , one also has @xmath66 .    in order to improve the uniformity of the progress of the nodes in the above distributed - computing example , ultimately leading to better scalable performance , one must suppress large fluctuation in the synchronization landscape .",
    "for example , one can construct a scalable autonomous synchronization schemes where the nodes , in addition to their nearest neighbor on the grid , also communicate with random ( possibly distant ) neighbors ( with a very low frequency ) ; the sole purpose of communications through the random links is to keep the spread of the task - completion landscape under control @xcite . in this case , the underlying synchronization network is a sw network ( which can be quenched or annealed , depending on the implementation ) .",
    "while the precise local synchronization rules give rise to strongly non - linear effective interactions between the nodes , one can gain some insight by considering the linearized version of the effective equations of motion .",
    "as it was shown for the basic distributed - computing synchronization problem @xcite , the dynamics , neglecting non - linearities , can be effectively captured by the ew process @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the ew process to complex networks @xcite ( focusing on pl - sw networks in this paper ) , is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the diffusion operator _ on the network _ and @xmath69 ( without loss of generality ) is a delta - correlated white noise with variance @xmath70 : @xmath71 in general , the symmetric relaxational couplings between the nodes , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , can be weighted .",
    "the generalized network laplacian then can be written as @xmath74 for unweighted networks with unit coupling strength @xmath72 is simply the adjacency matrix .",
    "clearly , the precise scaling behavior of synchronization landscape ( its width , in particular ) is strongly affected by _ both _ the nonlinearities and the underlying interaction topology .",
    "our results provide a detailed account on the network s effect on the ew synchronization problem . because of the linear nature of the model , this is a much simpler problem than the actual synchronization dynamics , but , as we shall see in the following sections , the behavior of it is still nontrivial , particularly on quenched sw networks .",
    "the understanding of the ew process ( on networks ) is a necessary first step before tackling more complicated , nonlinear problems .",
    "using the fokker - planck description of the ew process , it can be shown @xcite that the steady - state probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the possible surface configurations is @xmath75 \\propto \\exp { \\left}(-{h[\\vec{h } ] } { \\right } ) , \\label{ss_pdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the configuration - vector and @xmath77 $ ] is the steady - state hamiltonian of the surface @xmath78=\\frac12 \\sum_{ij } h_i { \\delta}_{ij } h_j = \\frac12 \\sum_{ij } a_{ij } ( h_i - h_j)^2 \\;. \\label{eq : h[h ] aij}\\ ] ] the steady - state green s function ( gf ) or _ propagator _ of the system is defined as the two - point correlation function . since the steady - state pdf is gaussian , the two - point correlation function is the inverse of the coupling matrix . in our case , @xmath79 is non - invertible because of the uniform eigenmode @xmath80 with zero eigenvalue [ eq .  ( [ zero_mode ] ) ] .",
    "the singularity of this mode can also be traced back to eq .",

    "this problem can be overcome by constructing observables which lie in the space orthogonal to the zero mode of the network laplacian .",
    "it can be achieved by , e.g. , measuring height fluctuations from the mean [ see eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) ] .",
    "hence , the appropriately defined gf is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the inverse of @xmath79 in the space orthogonal to the uniform zero mode .",
    "particularly useful for numerical purposes , one can employ the spectral decomposition of the inverse of the network laplacian in the space orthogonal to the zero mode @xmath85 note that since the gf is constructed from the height fluctuations measured from the mean , the zero mode automatically drops out from the sum .    employing the gf , the average width can be expressed as @xmath86 or , for numerical purposes , @xmath87      in the network research literature , an `` abstract '' transport efficiency can be considered in analogy with electric conductance properties of a network @xcite .",
    "the average resistance of a network gives a simplified but palpable interpretation of its transport properties .",
    "if the average network resistance is low , it can be interpreted as a network with good transport properties ; if the resistance is high , the network is likely to be a poor choice for transportation purposes .",

    ", in transport or flow problems on networks , one often considers the  load \" of the nodes or the links , which can be captured by an appropriately defined betweenness measure @xcite ( for a given dynamics ) .",
    "this observable captures the amount of traffic , information , or data , the nodes or the links typically handle in the corresponding information , social , or infrastructure network .",
    "for example , in random routing or search problems on complex networks , an appropriate _ node betweenness _ can defined as _ the expected number of visits _ to node @xmath63 by a random walker ( starting at a source node and before reaching its randomly chosen target ) , averaged over all source and target pairs @xcite .",

    "@xmath100 for the same rw problem ( the expected number of times a walker travels across the link between nodes @xmath63 and @xmath88 , averaged over all source and target pairs ) can be written as @xmath101 the link betweenness , capturing the load of the connections between the nodes , can be used to extract the congestion threshold in bandwidth - limited traffic .",
    "further , one can also show that the average first - passage time for the above random - walk problem ( averaged over all source and target pairs ) can be written as @xcite @xmath102 as all of the above examples illustrate , the average two - point resistance of a graph @xmath99 ( or , equivalently , the average steady - state width of the associated ew synchronization landscape ) plays a fundamental role in the efficiency of prototypical transport problems .",
    "in the literature of networks the disorder of links is considered _ annealed _ or _ mean - field _ ( mf ) when it can be approximated by its average value .",
    "such a situation can emerge when the process investigated on the network feels only the average effect of the links due to the dynamics of the system , in other words , when the timescale of the changes in the configuration of the links is much shorter than the characteristic timescale of the process on it .",

    "<S> it has been well - established that in a large class of interacting systems , adding an arbitrarily small density of , possibly long - range , quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction topology , will give rise to mean - field like behavior ( i.e. , the small - world - like random links can be treated in a mean - field fashion ) . in some cases , however , mean - field scaling breaks down in `` low - dimensional '' small - world networks , where random links are added to a low - dimensional regular structure . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such cases are the common diffusion and the edwards - wilkinson process , the main subjects of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this break - down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively , where the mean - field prediction appears as the lowest - order term of a naive perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic analytic results are also confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the network laplacian . </S>",
