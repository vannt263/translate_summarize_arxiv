    "this suggests that a similar equilibration mechanism might be at work in the relaxation dynamics of the rather complex laponite samples , where some competing length scale is confining the particle fluctuations , thus leading to saturation of the incoherent scatering function .",
    "the waiting - time dependent saturation is in line with the fact that effective temperatures , measured through the fdt , should become the bath temperature at fixed time - delay and sufficiently long waiting times where saturation is found .",
    "the measurements in  @xcite are such that the effective temperature does indeed tend to the bath temperature at fixed working frequency ",
    "equivalently time - delay ",
    "when @xmath2 is large enough , although this result remains controversial  @xcite .    with this analytic study we showed that the qualitative aging dynamics of the vortex glass  @xcite as well as the elastic line in a quenched disordered environment  @xcite is mainly due to the non - equilibrium relaxation of the pure elastic lines .",
    "the effect of quenched disorder and line - line interactions is to change the details of the scaling , more precisely the temperature and time - dependence in @xmath133 , but not the qualitative features . along this line",
    ", the study of the aging dynamics of the pure kpz equation  @xcite will allow one to better rationalize the results in  @xcite , where the aging dynamics of this equation with a disordered potential  and driving force  was analyzed .",
    "furthermore , the results obtained here could be strongly related to the non - equilibrium relaxation dynamics of confined polymers  @xcite .",
    "we presented the first analytic calculation of finite - size fluctuations during an out - of - equilibrium relaxation .",
    "this study complements the analysis in @xcite and @xcite for the width fluctuations at saturation and growth and in @xcite for other quantities such as the maximum height displacement  indeed , it is also simple to include the @xmath2-dependence in this calculation .",
    "our results make explicit the dependence on the waiting - time and display the crossover to equilibrium .",
    "they constitute a benchmark for rcz proposal to classify interface dynamics into universality classes  @xcite , now extending it to the non - equilibrium relaxation .",
    "as regards the time - reparametrization invariance scenario for glassy dynamics we do not expect it to hold , without modification , in models with multiplicative aging scaling . following the steps sketched in @xcite to study the asymptotic averaged dynamics of the ew line ( or massless scalar field ) and its corresponding dynamic action",
    ", one soon realizes that the multiplicative @xmath247 factor has to be extracted from the asymptotic analysis to search for time - reparametrization invariance .",
    "this is similar to what was shown in @xcite for the o(@xmath12 ) model in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "one should also notice that the dynamics of the ew line depends on the dimensionality of the transverse space .",
    "for instance , one can show that for infinite systems diffusion disappears and the aging regime persists at infinite waiting - times ( _ i.e. _ the scaling becomes additive ) in two transverse dimensions  @xcite .",
    "one has then the interesting possibility of testing the time - reparametrization invariance scenario in the ` critical ' ew equation with two transverse dimensions .",
    "the detailed analysis of the dynamic symmetries of the generic ew line goes beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we conclude with a note on the relevance of our results for coarsening phenomena .",
    "the domain walls between equilibrated regions during domain growth are usually described as elastic objects .",
    "recently , the distribution of domain sizes and perimeter lengths in two - dimensional ising ferromagnetic growth was shown to be unexpectedly non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "the wide distribution of domain sizes and domain wall lengths combined with the highly non - trivial fluctuating dynamics of finite - length elastic lines derived here suggest that characterising the fluctuations of standard two - times observables in domain - growth phenomena can be a quite complicated problem .",
