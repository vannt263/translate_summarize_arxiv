    "in @xcite de giorgi proposed the following conjecture .    [ 1.1 ] let be given @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 integer .",
    "for every @xmath3 let @xmath4 be a minimizer of the functional for @xmath5 @xmath6 in the class of all functions @xmath7 satisfying the initial conditions @xmath8 , @xmath9 . then , there exists @xmath10 , and satisfies the equation @xmath11    the interest in this conjecture resides in the possibility of connecting the _ difficult _ semilinear wave equation with a comparably _ easier _ problem : the constrained minimization of the uniformly convex functional @xmath12 .",
    "note for instance that no uniqueness for the semilinear wave equation is available for large @xmath13 whereas the functional @xmath12 always admits a unique minimizer .",
    "the reference to _",
    "elliptic regularization _ in this context is related to the fact that the euler - lagrange equation for the functional @xmath12 can be formally computed as @xmath14 namely , minimizing @xmath12 consists in addressing a fourth - order elliptic regularization in time of the semilinear wave equation .",
    "the statement of conjecture [ 1.1 ] does not specify the convergence notion for @xmath15 nor the solution notion for equation .",
    "we shall tacitly assume in the following that the convergence is ( at least ) almost everywhere in space and time , that convergence holds ( at least ) for subsequences , and that equation will be solved ( at least ) in the distributional sense .",
    "along with these provisions , the main result of the paper is the following .    [ main ] let @xmath16 .",
    "then , conjecture _ [ 1.1 ] _ holds true .    in the scalar case @xmath17 , conjecture [ 1.1 ]",
    "is illustrated in figure [ fig ] .     in the scalar case @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the dashed lines are the minimizers of @xmath12 for @xmath21 ( top at @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( bottom ) , whereas the solid line is the unique solution of @xmath26 , along with the given boundary conditions . ]",
    "note that the possibility of considering @xmath27 seems to be nontrivial and it is currently out of reach for the present analysis .",
    "moreover , although not explicitly mentioned in the original text of conjecture [ 1.1 ] , one may quite naturally wonder if the limit trajectory @xmath7 attains the initial conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 as well . in this regard ,",
    "we shall remark that our analysis is still partial as the only condition @xmath28 is ascertained in the following .    on the other hand , we are in the position of proving some generalization of conjecture [ 1.1 ] as well .",
    "indeed , assumptions on the initial data @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be weakened and convergence is proved to take place in a suitable topology ( and , correspondingly , to a stronger solution notion ) .",
    "more significantly , we can allow for more general nonlinearities , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we prove conjecture [ 1.1 ] for all @xmath32 .",
    "the natural energy estimate for semilinear wave equation entails a pointwise - in - time bound on @xmath7 in terms of data .",
    "the core of the proof of conjecture [ 1.1 ] relies in checking that , even in the elliptic - regularized situation of the euler - lagrange equation , we are in the position of establishing a corresponding _ integral _ energy estimate for @xmath4 independently of @xmath33 .",
    "namely , we have the following .    [ ee ] let @xmath4 minimize @xmath12 for @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath37 where @xmath38 depends on @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath39 but not on @xmath33 .",
    "the proof of this lemma will be detailed in section [ apri ] .",
    "once the energy estimate is established , conjecture [ 1.1 ] follows by passing to the limit in ( a suitable variational version of ) the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "this limiting procedure is discussed in section [ limit ] .",
    "eventually , extensions and comments are collected in subsection [ comments ] .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first result in the direction of elliptic regularization of nonlinear hyperbolic equations .",
    "elliptic regularization has been already considered in the frame of parabolic problems and results in the linear case can be found in lions & magenes @xcite .",
    "the first application of this variational perspective to a nonlinear dissipative problem is due to ilmanen @xcite in the context of mean curvature flow .",
    "results and applications to rate - independent dissipative systems have been presented by mielke & ortiz @xcite and then extended and coupled with time - discretization in @xcite . in the case of gradient flows , two relaxation and scaling examples are provided by conti & ortiz @xcite whereas the general abstract theory is addressed in @xcite . some application to mean curvature flow of cartesian surfaces is in @xcite and the elliptic regularization of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations",
    "is discussed in @xcite . finally ,",
    "a similar functional approach ( with @xmath33 fixed though ) has been considered by lucia , muratov , & novaga @xcite in connection with travelling waves in reaction - diffusion - advection problems .    on the other hand ,",
    "the literature on the semilinear wave equation is vast and it is clearly beyond the purposes of this note to provide a comprehensive review . the reader can consider the monographs by lions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap . 1 ) and by shatah & struwe (",
    "* subsect .",
    "8.3.1 ) for a collection of results , references , and historical remarks .",
    "this section brings to the proof of lemma [ ee ] .",
    "we start by presenting a formal argument in subsection [ formal ] .",
    "then , the rigorous proof is achieved by means of a time - discretization procedure and is detailed in the subsections 2.2 - 2.5 .    in the following @xmath40 stands for the usual scalar product in @xmath41 and @xmath42 is used both for the corresponding norm and the modulus in @xmath43 and @xmath44 . moreover ,",
    "given @xmath45 ( note that @xmath46 , take @xmath47 ) , for all @xmath48 we will use the notation @xmath49 in particular , let us observe that @xmath50 @xmath51    define the space @xmath52 and let @xmath4 minimize @xmath12 over the non - empty , convex , and closed set @xmath53 by considering @xmath54 for @xmath55 we obtain that @xmath56 for the sake of notational simplicity , we shall drop the superscript @xmath33 from @xmath4 in the remainder of this section .",
    "let us present here some heuristics for lemma [ ee ] . by assuming smoothness",
    ", we get from that @xmath7 solves @xmath57 namely , the euler - lagrange equation holds along with the _ final _ homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath58    test now by the function @xmath59 and take the integral on @xmath60 . by recalling that @xmath61",
    "we obtain the equality @xmath62 note that this computation amounts in testing by @xmath63 , integrating in time , and summing the result with the same relation integrated in time once again ( see ) .",
    "namely , we summarize this procedure as follows @xmath64    owing to the final boundary conditions , the right - hand side of can be controlled as follows @xmath65 where @xmath38 depends on @xmath39 . hence , for @xmath34 ,",
    "one has that @xmath66 namely , the energy estimate holds .",
    "the argument of subsection [ formal ] is formal .",
    "in particular , the final boundary conditions make no sense as @xmath67 only .    in order to provide a rigorous proof of lemma [ ee ]",
    "we will proceed by time - discretization . to this aim",
    "let the time step @xmath68 be fixed , consider the space @xmath69 and define the functional @xmath70 by @xmath71 given the vector @xmath72 , in the latter we have used the notation @xmath73 for its _ discrete derivative _",
    "@xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 and so on .",

    "the strategy of the proof of lemma [ ee ] consists in establishing the energy estimate at the time - discrete level ( subsection [ stab ] ) and then pass to the limit as @xmath91 ( subsection [ passage ] ) . as a preparatory step , we present the euler - lagrange equation for the time - discrete functional @xmath83 in subsection [ eesec ] .",
    "let us define the convex set @xmath92 the time - discrete functional @xmath83 is clearly convex .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 turns out to be coercive on @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , the coercivity of @xmath83 in @xmath94 with respect to the components @xmath95 is immediate . as for the coercivity in @xmath96 we preliminarily observe that , for all @xmath97 , @xmath98 where @xmath38 depends on @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we have that @xmath99 where @xmath38 is the constant in .",
    "in particular , the functional @xmath83 controls the norm in @xmath96 ( up to constants depending on @xmath39 , @xmath33 , and @xmath84 ) .",
    "moreover , the quadratic character of the first term in @xmath83 and the latter computation ensure that the functional @xmath83 is uniformly convex in @xmath96 along @xmath93 .",

    "note incidentally that the final boundary conditions in imply , in particular , that @xmath108 .",
    "the strategy of the proof of the energy estimate at the time - discrete level is exactly the same as that of section [ formal ] . in particular , we present a time - discrete version of estimate by using the time - discrete euler - lagrange equation instead of .",
    "namely , we perform the following @xmath109 ( note that @xmath110 for @xmath111 )",
    ".    we shall start by the first term in .",
    "hence , we test relation on @xmath112 and sum for @xmath113 in order to get that @xmath114    let us now treat separately the terms in the above left - hand side . the fourth - order - in - time term can be handled as follows .",
    "@xmath115    next , we treat the third - order - in - time term of as @xmath116    as for the remaining terms in we compute @xmath117    by recollecting the computations - into equation we deduce that @xmath118    let us now move to the consideration of the second term in .",
    "we multiply by @xmath84 and take the sum for @xmath119 getting @xmath120    before going on , we prepare some computations in order to handle some terms in the above left - hand side . by summing by parts , we have that @xmath121    moreover , we can also compute that @xmath122    finally , let us observe that @xmath123    let us now write estimate by choosing @xmath124 and taking advantage of the final boundary conditions as @xmath125 by taking the sum of the latter and and using equality and estimates - , we obtain that @xmath126 the latter is nothing but the discrete analogue of the former ( and formal ) estimate .",
    "similarly to , the above right - hand side can be bounded as follows @xmath127 eventually , we have proved the following .",
