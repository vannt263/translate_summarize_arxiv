    "<S> we investigate the transient response of a @xmath0-type system with one transition decaying to a modified radiation reservoir with an inverse square - root singular density of modes at threshold , under conditions of transparency . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the time evolution of the linear susceptibility for the probe laser field and show that , depending on the strength of the coupling to the modified vacuum and the background decay , the probe transmission can exhibit behaviour ranging from underdamped to overdamped oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> transient gain without population inversion is also possible depending on the system s parameters . </S>",
    "<S> + pacs : 42.50.gy,42.70.qs    2 it has been now well documented that quantum coherence and interference effects can modify the absorption and dispersion properties of an atomic system @xcite . in the most common situation , that of a @xmath0-type three - level system , the medium becomes transparent to a probe laser field near an otherwise absorbing resonant transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved via the application of a second laser field coupling to the linked transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to steady state studies , considerable work has been done on the transient properties of coherent phenomena such as , for example , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , gain ( or lasing ) without inversion @xcite and coherent population trapping @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as has been recently shown @xcite , transparency can occur in the steady state absorption of a @xmath0-type system when one of the atomic transitions is coupled to a modified radiation reservoir having a threshold with an inverse square - root dependence of the density of modes , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the heaviside step function and @xmath3 being the gap frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such a density of modes can be found near thresholds in waveguides @xcite , in microcavities @xcite , and near the edge of a photonic band gap material which is described by an isotropic model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that there is current interest in coherent phenomena which occur in modified reservoirs having relatively weak modal densities where the born and markov approximations can be applied @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that coherence effects can take a considerable time to be set up @xcite , and the purpose of the present work is to investigate this question when structured radiation reservoirs are employed . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study the @xmath4 behaviour of the absorption of a @xmath0-type system , similar to the one used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where transparency in the @xmath5 @xmath6 absorption spectrum of the system was predicted . in our system , one of the atomic transitions is spontaneously coupled to a frequency - dependent reservoir which displays the above mentioned inverse square - root behaviour in its density of modes . solving the equation of motion for all times , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the rate at which the atomic medium becomes transparent to the probe field depends crucially on both the background decay rate of the upper atomic level and the strength of the coupling to the modified vacuum modes . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , under certain conditions , the system can exhibit transient gain without inversion .    </S>",
    "<S> the atomic system under consideration is shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of three atomic levels in a @xmath0-type configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the atom is assumed to be initially in state @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition @xmath8 is taken to be near - resonant with a frequency - dependent reservoir , while the transition @xmath9 is assumed to be far away from the gap and is treated as a free space transition . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system can be described using a probability amplitude approach . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system , in the interaction picture and the rotating wave approximation , is given by ( we use units such that @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 -i \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } |1\\rangle \\langle1| \\ , . </S>",

    "<S> also , @xmath20 is the laser detuning from resonance with the @xmath9 transition , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the energy of state @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the probe laser field angular frequency . in addition </S>",

    "<S> it is assumed that these states are situated far from the gap so that such background decay can be treated as a markovian process . </S>",
    "<S> we note that we are interested in the perturbative behaviour of the system to the probe laser pulse , therefore @xmath25 can also account for the radiative decay of state @xmath26 to state @xmath7 finally , @xmath27 @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the quantization volume , @xmath28@xmath33 is the unit polarization vector , @xmath34 is the photon annihilation operator and @xmath35 is the angular frequency of the @xmath36 mode of the modified radiation reservoir vacuum field .    </S>",

    "<S> the time evolution of the absorption and dispersion properties of the system are determined by , respectively , the imaginary and real parts of the time - dependent linear susceptibility @xmath47 . in our case , the susceptibility can be expressed as @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the atomic density . the solution of eqs . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , if @xmath89 then @xmath90 . therefore , at least two roots and at most three roots contribute on the solution ( [ a1 t ] ) depending on the system parameters .    within our perturbative approach , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ suscep ] ) yields @xmath91 , where @xmath57 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a1 t ] ) . as has been shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , steady state transparency occurs for the case that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case that also interests us here . in figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> we plot the time evolution of the imaginary part of the linear , time - dependent susceptibility @xmath93 $ ] for different values of the background decay @xmath25 and with @xmath94 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath95 , the susceptibility is always positive ( which denotes absorption in our convention ) , has a maximum and the steady state value is reached adiabatically . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath96 , the system exhibits only absorption , however small oscillations are visible at the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath25 decreases , then these oscillations become more pronounced , and small gain ( or lasing ) without the presence of population inversion between @xmath26 and @xmath7 , shown by negative values of the time - dependent linear susceptibility , is found . </S>",
    "<S> if the background decay decreases further and reaches the regime that @xmath97 the oscillations increase further , the gain without inversion increases , the interaction becomes more non - adiabatic and the steady state value is reached for very large times .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour displayed in the previous figure can be understood if the time evolution of the population of the excited state @xmath26 is examined . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from figure 3 , after an initial weak absorption the population of the state @xmath26 can either decay smoothly to zero ( for the case @xmath95 ) or evolve by undergoing damped rabi oscillations between states @xmath26 and @xmath98 due to reversible decay which arises via the interaction with the modified reservoir @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations increase as the background decay decreases compared to the coupling strength to the frequency - dependent radiation reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way a time - dependent coherence between states @xmath26 and @xmath98 is created which is responsible for the phenomenon of transient gain without inversion shown in figure 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour of the system is related to the one predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite in a typical three level @xmath0-type atomic system which exhibits electromagnetically induced transparency through the application of a coupling laser field . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in our case , is that the transparency and the transient gain without inversion occur due to the coupling to a radiation reservoir with an inverse square - root singularity of the density of modes at threshold and are not induced by an external laser field .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have discussed the transient properties of the transparency in a @xmath0-type atom in which one transition spontaneously decays to a specific frequency - dependent radiation reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the absorption and thus the way that the steady state is reached depends crucially on the background decay rate and the strength of the coupling to the modified reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> transient gain without population inversion is found to exist if the coupling strength to the modified reservoir is larger than the background decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> we have only been concerned with the time evolution of the linear absorption properties of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the dispersive properties of the system , which is another topic of interest @xcite , will be discussed separately . </S>",
    "<S> in such a study the simple relationship between the real part of the susceptibility and the group velocity can not be applied ( as it holds only for the steady state ) , and a different approach needs to be implemented . </S>"
