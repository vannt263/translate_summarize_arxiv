    "migration in a geographically structured population may have opposing effects on the genetic composition of that population and , hence , on its evolutionary potential . on the one hand , gene flow caused by migration",
    "may be so strong that it not only limits but hinders local adaptation by swamping the whole population with a genotype that has high fitness in only one or a few demes .",
    "on the other hand , if migration is sufficiently weak , gene flow may replenish local populations with genetic variation and contribute to future adaptation . in this case",
    ", locally adapted genotypes may coexist in the population and maintain high levels of genetic variation as well as differentiation between subpopulations . for reviews of the corresponding ,",
    "well developed one - locus theory , see karlin ( 1982 ) , lenormand ( 2002 ) , and nagylaki and lou ( 2008 ) .",
    "if selection acts on more than one locus , additional questions arise immediately .",
    "for instance , what are the consequences of the genetic architecture , such as linkage between loci , relative magnitude of locus effects or epistasis , on the degree of local adaptation and of differentiation achieved for a given amount of gene flow ?",
    "what are the consequences for genetic variation at linked neutral sites ? what genetic architectures can be expected to evolve under various forms of spatially heterogeneous selection ?    for selection acting on multiple loci ,",
    "the available theory is much less well developed than for a single locus .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the interaction of migration and selection , even if the latter is nonepistatic , leads to linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) between loci ( li and nei 1974 , christiansen and feldman 1975 , slatkin 1975 , barton 1983 ) .",
    "ld causes substantial , often insurmountable , complications in the analysis of multilocus models .",
    "therefore , many multilocus studies are primarily numerical and focus on quite specific situations or problems . for instance , spichtig and kawecki ( 2004 ) investigated numerically the influence of the number of loci and of epistasis on the degree of polymorphism if selection acts antagonistically in two demes .",
    "yeaman and whitlock ( 2011 ) showed that concentrated genetic architecture , i.e. , clusters of linked , locally beneficial alleles , evolve if stabilizing selection acts on a trait such that the fitness optima in two demes differ .",
    "linkage disequilibrium is also essential for the evolution of recombination .",
    "the evolution of recombination in heterogeneous environments has been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , charlesworth and charlesworth 1979 , pylkov et al .",
    "1998 , lenormand and otto 2000 ) , and the results depend strongly on the kind of variability of selection across environments , the magnitude of migration , and the sign and strength of epistasis .",
    "recent years have seen some advances in developing general theory for multilocus migration - selection models .",
    "the focus of this work was on the properties of the evolutionary dynamics and the conditions for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism in limiting or special cases , such as weak or strong migration ( brger , 2009a , b ) , or in the levene model ( nagylaki 2009 ; brger 2009c , 2010 ; barton 2010 ; chasnov 2012 ) .",
    "this progress was facilitated by the fact that in each case , ld is weak or absent .    using a continent - island - model framework , brger and akerman ( 2011 ) and bank et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analyzed the effects of gene flow on local adaptation , differentiation , the emergence of dobzhansky - muller incompatibilities , and the maintenance of polymorphism at two linked diallelic loci .",
    "they obtained analytical characterizations of the possible equilibrium configurations and bifurcation patterns for wide ranges of parameter combinations . in these models , typically high ld is maintained . in particular",
    ", explicit formulas were derived for the maximum migration rate below which a fully polymorphic equilibrium can be maintained , as well as for the minimum migration rate above which the island is swamped by the continental haplotype .    here",
    ", we explore the robustness of some of these results by admitting arbitrary ( forward and backward ) migration between two demes .",
    "this generalization leads to substantial mathematical complications , but also to new biological insight . because our focus is on the consequences of gene flow for local adaptation and differentiation , we assume divergent selection among the demes , i.e. , alleles @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are favored in deme 1 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are favored in deme 2 .",
    "the loci may recombine at an arbitrary rate . by ignoring epistasis and dominance ,",
    "we assume genic selection . mutation and random drift are neglected .",
    "because we assume evolution in continuous time , our model also describes selection on haploids .",
    "the model is set up in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we derive the equilibrium and stability structure for several important special cases .",
    "these include weak , strong , highly asymmetric , and super - symmetric migration , no or weak recombination , independent or strongly recombining loci , and absence of genotype - environment interaction . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the dependence of the equilibrium and stability patterns on the total migration rate while keeping the ratio of migration rates , the recombination rate , and the selection coefficients constant ( but arbitrary ) .",
    "in particular , we derive the possible bifurcation patterns for the cases of independent loci ( linkage equilibrium ) and for completely linked loci . with the help of perturbation theory",
    ", we obtain the equilibrium and stability configurations for weak or strong migration , highly asymmetric migration , and weak or strong recombination . for these cases ,",
    "we determine the maximum migration rate below which a stable , fully polymorphic equilibrium is maintained , and the minimum migration rate above which the population is monomorphic .",
    "numerical work complements our analytical results .",
    "the next four sections are devoted to applications of the theory developed in sections 3 and 4 . in section 5 and 6",
    ", we use the migration load and a new , genuine multilocus , fixation index ( @xmath0 ) , respectively , to quantify the dependence of local adaptation and of differentiation on various parameters , especially , on the migration and the recombination rate . in section 7 , we investigate the invasion conditions for a mutant of small effect ( @xmath1 ) that is beneficial in one deme but disadvantageous in the other deme .",
    "we assume that the mutant is linked to a polymorphic locus which is in selection - migration balance .",
    "we show that linkage between the loci facilitates invasion . therefore , in such a scenario",
    ", clusters of locally adapted alleles are expected to emerge ( cf .",
    "yeaman and whitlock 2011 , brger and akerman 2011 ) . in section 8 ,",
    "we study the strength of barriers to gene flow at neutral sites linked to the selected loci by deriving an explicit approximation for the effective migration rate at a linked neutral site .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in section 9 . several purely technical proofs",
    "are relegated to the appendix .",
    "we consider a sexually reproducing population of monoecious , diploid individuals that is subdivided into two demes connected by genotype - independent migration . within each deme",
    ", there is random mating .",
    "we assume that two diallelic loci are under genic selection , i.e. , there is no dominance or epistasis , and different alleles are favored in different demes .",
    "we assume soft selection , i.e. , population regulation occurs within each deme .",
    "we ignore random genetic drift and mutation and employ a deterministic continuous - time model to describe evolution .",
    "a continuous - time model is obtained from the corresponding discrete - time model in the limit of weak evolutionary forces ( here , selection , recombination , and migration ) .",
    "we denote the rate at which individuals in deme 1 ( deme 2 ) are replaced by immigrants from the other deme by @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "then @xmath7 is the total migration rate .",
    "the recombination rate between the two loci is designated by @xmath8 .",
    "alleles at locus @xmath9 are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath3 , at locus @xmath10 by @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "we posit that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are favored in deme 1 , whereas @xmath3 and @xmath4 are favored in deme 2 . in deme @xmath11 ( @xmath12 )",
    ", we assign the malthusian parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 to @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "because we assume absence of dominance and of epistasis , the resulting fitness matrix for the genotypes reads @xmath17    by relabeling alleles , we can assume without loss of generality @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    ", we can assume @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath23 by exchanging demes , i.e. , by the transformation @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 denotes the deme @xmath27 ) , or by exchanging loci , i.e. , by the transformation @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we can further assume @xmath30 without loss of generality , cf .  appendix [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "the fitness matrix is also obtained if the two loci contribute additively to a quantitative trait that is under linear directional selection in each deme ( brger 2009c ) .",
    "then @xmath31 if the genotypic values are deme independent , i.e. , if there is no genotype - environment interaction on the trait level .",
    "because in the case @xmath31 degenerate features can occur , it will be treated separately ( sections [ sec : theta=0 ] and [ sec : super_symm ] ) .",
    "therefore , unless stated otherwise , we always impose the following assumptions on our parameters :    [ eq : parameter ] @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34    from and , we infer @xmath35 therefore , locus @xmath9 is under weaker selection than locus @xmath10 in both demes , i.e. , @xmath36 for @xmath12 , if and only if @xmath37 holds .",
    "the population can be described by the gamete frequencies in each of the demes .",

    "we note that @xmath52 corresponds to an excess of the locally adapted haplotypes in deme @xmath11 .",

    "it is often more convenient to work with allele frequencies and the ld measures @xmath57 .",

    "their magnitude is determined by the time scale . by rescaling time , for instance to units of @xmath70 or @xmath72 ,",
    "the number of independent parameters could be reduced by one without changing the equilibrium properties .",
    "we distinguish three types of equilibria : ( i ) monomorphic equilibria ( me ) , ( ii ) single - locus polymorphisms ( slps ) , and ( iii ) full ( two - locus ) polymorphisms ( fps ) .",
    "the first two types are boundary equilibria , whereas fps are internal equilibria ( except when @xmath73 )",
    ". the stability properties of the me and the coordinates and conditions for admissibility of the slps can be derived explicitly .",

    "the equilibrium and stability structure for weak migration can be deduced from the model with no migration by perturbation theory . in the absence of migration ( @xmath110 ) , the two subpopulations evolve independently . because selection is nonepistatic and there is no dominance , in each deme",

    "boundary equilibria remain unstable for sufficiently small migration rates .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the coordinates of the perturbed equilibrium to leading order in @xmath117 and @xmath104 .",

    "its coordinates are given by .",
    "proposition [ prop_weak_mig ] remains valid if the assumptions and are dropped .",
    "apart from the obvious fact that migration reduces differences between subpopulations , the above approximations show that the lower the recombination rate , the smaller is this reduction .",

    "thus , the dynamics of the full system is a cartesian product of the two one - locus dynamics .",

    ", however , the load in each deme does not always increase with increasing @xmath72 .",
    "the reason is that for sufficiently strong migration , generically , first one locus , then one of the haplotypes becomes fixed ( proposition [ prop_strong_mig ] ) .",

    "in such a case , the load of the total population may also decrease with increasing @xmath72 .",
    "this occurs for large migration rates ( not far below @xmath338 ) and it can occur for completely linked loci as well as for loci in le . in the ci model , the load always increases with the migration rate ( brger and akerman 2011 )    finally , although @xmath458 is increasing in @xmath70 if migration is weak , this is not necessarily so if migration is strong . by using a grid of parameter combinations",

    "therefore , most of our mathematical results focus on existence and stability of polymorphic equilibria and on the dependence of the equilibrium configurations on the model parameters ( migration rates , selection coefficients , recombination rate ) .    the model is introduced in section 2 .",

    ", a stable ( @xmath116 ) and an unstable fully polymorphic equilibrium may exist if recombination is intermediate , and @xmath116 is simultaneously stable with a boundary equilibrium . in general ( section [ section_general ] ) , we can not exclude the existence of more than two internal equilibria or complicated dynamical behavior .",
    "numerical searches produced no such instances .",
    "what can be shown easily is that , if @xmath540 , any fully polymorphic equilibrium exhibits ld . in all cases , where an internal equilibrium was calculated ( numerically or analytically )",
    ", it exhibited positive ld .    in the super - symmetric case ,",
    "in which selection in deme 2 mirrors that in deme 1 and migration is symmetric , an assumption made in several applications , a fully polymorphic equilibrium exists always and , presumably , is stable ( section [ sec : super_symm ] ) .",

    "whereas in section 3 the focus was on the efficient presentation of the existence and stability results of equilibria , in section 4 these results are used to derive the possible bifurcation patterns with the total migration rate @xmath72 as the bifurcation parameter .",
    "all possible bifurcation patterns could be derived under the assumption of le ( theorem [ le_theorem ] , figures 2 and 3 ) , and under the assumption of complete linkage ( theorem [ mainresult_no_reco ] , figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the latter case is considerably more complex . interestingly , in each case , every bifurcation pattern can occur for every ratio @xmath542 of migration rates by choosing the selection coefficients appropriately .",
    "hence , the assumption of symmetric migration does not yield simpler equilibrium configurations than general migration if arbitrary selection coefficients are admitted .    in each of these cases ( le or @xmath73 ) , we determined the maximum migration rate @xmath338 admitting an asymptotically stable , fully polymorphic equilibrium ( corollaries [ corollary_mmaxinf ] and [ corollary_mmax0 ] ) .",
    "the maximum migration rate @xmath431 for @xmath73 always exceeds or equals that ( @xmath337 ) for le , i.e. , @xmath543 .",
    "although for strong recombination , @xmath338 can be very slightly smaller than @xmath337 ( section [ qle ] ) , in the vast majority of investigated cases , @xmath338 is bracketed by @xmath337 and @xmath431 ( figure 6 , section [ sec : general_case ] ) .",
    "proposition [ prop_strong_mig ] demonstrates that a me is globally attracting if migration is sufficiently strong ( except in the degenerate case noted above ) .",
    "if we interpret the equilibria @xmath97 and @xmath98 as fixation of a generalist ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 are haplotypes of intermediate fitness ) , and @xmath93 and @xmath100 as fixation of a specialist ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the locally adapted haplotypes ) , then depending on the sign of @xmath201 one of the generalists becomes fixed for high @xmath72 if @xmath224 is intermediate ( i.e. , @xmath294 if @xmath193 , @xmath544 if @xmath105 ; but note that , depending on the selection coefficients , both @xmath545 and @xmath546 can be arbitrarily close to 0 or 1 . ) .",
    "the critical value @xmath72 as well as @xmath545 and @xmath546 are independent of @xmath70 .",
    "otherwise , one of the specialists becomes fixed for large @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that a generalist becomes fixed for strong migration is a distinct feature of ( balanced ) two - way migration : in the ci model or if migration is sufficiently asymmetric ( @xmath275 or @xmath303 if @xmath193 ) , one of the specialist haplotypes swamps the populations and becomes fixed .",
    "another difference between highly asymmetric and more symmetric migration patterns is that in the first case , it is always the locus under weaker selection that first loses its polymorphism while @xmath72 increases , whereas this not necessarily so in the latter case ( see section [ sec : admissibility_slp_m ] and theorem [ mainresult_no_reco ] , cases a3 and a4 ) .    in summary , we determined quantitatively when the following three evolutionarily stable states discussed by kawecki and ebert ( 2004 ) occur : ( i ) existence of a single specialist optimally adapted to one deme and poorly to the other , ( ii ) existence of a single generalist type which has higher average fitness in the whole population than than any of the specialists , and ( iii ) existence of a set of specialists each adapted to its deme , i.e. , coexistence in a polymorphism .",
    "local adaptation and differentiation occur only in case ( iii ) .    in section 5",
    ", we used the migration load in each deme to quantify the degree of local adaptation . in section 6",
    "we introduced a new multilocus version of @xmath0 to measure differentiation .",
    "if migration is weak , then local adaptation and differentiation decrease with increasing migration rate and increase with increasing linkage between the loci ( figure 7 ) . in particular , for given ( small ) migration rate , local adaptation and differentiation are maximized if the fitness effects are concentrated on a single locus ( corresponding to @xmath73 in our model ) .",
    "however , as discussed in section 5 , for high migration rates , the migration load of the total population can decrease with increasing recombination or migration rate .",
    "similarly , at high recombination and migration rates , @xmath0 can increase with increasing migration or recombination rate .",
    "thus , for given , relatively high migration rate , @xmath0 may be minimized at intermediate recombination rates .",
    "apparently , it is always maximized in the absence of recombination .    in section 7 , we investigated the conditions for invasion of locally beneficial mutants . at an isolated locus , such a mutant can invade and become established in a migration - selection equilibrium if and",
    "only if its advantage exceeds a threshold that increases with the immigration rate of the wild type ; see .",
    "if , however , this mutant occurs at a locus that is linked to a locus that is already in migration - selection balance , then its invasion is facilitated , i.e. , its local selective advantage can be smaller ( figure 8b ) .",
    "equivalently , for given selection coefficients and total migration rate , the minimum recombination rate needed for invasion increases if @xmath224 , or the influx of the ( deleterious ) wild type relative to the efflux of the new mutant , increases ( figure 8a ) .",
    "for the extreme case of one - way migration from a ` continental ' population to an ` island ' population that is adapting to a new environment , brger and akerman ( 2011 ) proved that invasion of a locally beneficial mutant is always facilitated by increased linkage to a locus in migration - selection balance .",
    "thus , our results complement the numerical finding by yeaman and whitlock ( 2011 ) for a multilocus quantitative - genetic model that clusters of locally adaptive mutations , or concentrated genetic architectures , build up in spatially structured populations with opposing selection pressures in two demes .",
    "because tighter linkage is required for invasion under increasingly asymmetric migration rates , more concentrated architectures and a greater advantage for recombination - reducing mechanisms ( such as chromosome inversions ) should be expected for highly asymmetric migration . in finite populations ,",
    "invasion of new mutants occurs only with a certain probability , and genetic drift may erase polymorphism .",
    "numerical work , supported by analytical methods , has already shed some light on the dependence of the probability of establishment of new , locally adaptive mutations on the recombination rate and other factors ( yeaman and otto 2011 , feder et al .",
    "analytical work on the role of genetic drift and finite population size on these issues is in progress .",
    "our results also show that , in the absence of epistasis and under the present form of balancing selection , reduced recombination between selected loci is favored , except when migration rates are sufficiently symmetric and high ( section 5 ) .",
    "selection inducing certain forms of epistasis may favor high recombination in structured populations more easily ( pylkov et al .",
    "1998 ; lenormand and otto , 2000 ; bank et al .",
    "therefore , general predictions about the emergence of clusters of locally adaptive mutations in regions of reduced recombination , or of genomic islands of speciation ( wu and ting 2004 ) or of differentiation ( feder et al .",
    "2012 ) , can not be made in the absence of detailed information about epistasis and the spatial pattern of selection and migration .",
    "at least in the absence of epistasis , the most favorable situation for the emergence of such clusters should occur in populations that are adapting to a new environment , still receiving maladaptive gene flow but sending out only very few or no migrants ( corresponding to a continent - island model ) .    in section 8",
    ", we derived the approximation for the effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus that is located between the selected loci .",
    "this approximation is simply the sum of the two effective migration rates under one - way migration ( brger and akerman , 2011 ) .",
    "because in the present model , polymorphism at the selected loci is maintained by balancing selection , the effective migration rate may be greatly reduced compared with the actual migration rate ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "thus , strong barriers against gene flow may build up at such neutral sites and enhance ( neutral ) differentiation ( see charlesworth and charlesworth 2010 , chap .",
    "future work will have to study the actual amount and pattern of neutral diversity at such sites in finite populations .",
    "we are grateful for useful comments on the manuscript by two anonymous referees .",
    "one of them inspired us to introduce the new multilocus fixation index .",
    "this work was supported by grants p21305 and p25188 of the austrian science fund fwf .",

    "generically , one of the following nine parameter sets applies :    @xmath547    in addition , there are the following three parameter sets : @xmath548    the sets  yield the complete parameter space of the selection coefficients .    we show that the parameter sets  can be derived from and by simple transformations .",
