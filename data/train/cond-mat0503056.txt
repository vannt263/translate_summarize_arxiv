    "the intriguing fermi surface ( fs ) evolution with doping in electron - doped cuprate nd@xmath4ce@xmath5cuo@xmath6 revealed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements@xcite has attracted much attention recently.@xcite it was observed that at low doping a small fs pocket appears around @xmath7 . upon",
    "increased doping a new pocket begins to emerge around @xmath8 and eventually at optimal doping @xmath9 the several fs pieces connect to form a large curve around @xmath10 . by use of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model and hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field treatment ,",
    "et al._@xcite have studied the fs in consideration of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and reached remarkable agreement with experiments .",
    "however , in their work the on - site @xmath3 is treated as a doping - dependent effective parameter , specifically @xmath11 at doping @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath9 . similarly a doping - dependent @xmath3 was argued by others based on numerical calculations.@xcite alternatively , the strong - coupling @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath14 model was adopted by some of us to construct the fs.@xcite without tuning parameters we have also obtained consistent results with arpes data .",
    "very recently , a systematic analysis of the optical conductivity for electron - doped cuprates was undertaken by millis _",
    "et al._@xcite it suggests that ( i ) the electron - doped materials are approximately as strongly correlated as the hole - doped ones and ( ii ) the @xmath3 value is _ not _ strongly doping dependent within the electron - doped family .",
    "both of these implications are in apparent disagreement with the theoretical studies by kusko _",
    "et al._,@xcite and in favor of the strong - coupling model used by us.@xcite on the other hand , our result at optimal doping from the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath14 model@xcite has not been reconciled by exact diagonalization calculations.@xcite thus it is still open whether the strong - coupling model , as implied by point ( i ) above , is available to explain the arpes data at optimal doping .    here our attention is focused on the issue relevant to point ( ii ) above , i.e. , for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model whether the strong doping dependence of @xmath3 as argued by kusko _",
    "et al._@xcite is really necessary for the interpretation of arpes data .",
    "theoretically it is not convincing to have a strongly doping - dependent @xmath3 since it is a local interaction within an atom and difficult to be changed by adding carriers . to understand why a strongly doping - dependent @xmath3 is needed by kusko _",
    "et al . _ , we come to some details of their work . within the hf mean - field theory ,",
    "two af energy bands are derived , with the minimum of the upper band around @xmath7 and the maximum of the lower one around @xmath8 . at low electron - doping ,",
    "the upper band is crossed by the fermi level , leading to a small fs pocket around @xmath7 . with increasing doping",
    ", the af order weakens and the lower band shifts towards the fermi level .",
    "the essential observation is that the af order decays with doping too slowly under a constant @xmath3 , and consequently the lower band is still too far away from the fermi level even at optimal doping to contribute any spectral intensity around @xmath8 .",
    "therefore an effective @xmath15 , which decreases with increasing @xmath16 , is enforced to expedite the decline of the af order so that the lower band approaches the fermi level rapidly leading to the consistency with arpes results .    actually , as we know , the hf theory overestimates the af order due to the ignorance of fluctuations .",
    "so a tempting idea is that the _ real _ af order should decay with doping in a ( much ) quicker way than obtained in the hf theory .",
    "then it is interesting to ask how much the hf results will be improved if the fluctuations are taken into account and whether the arpes data can already be explained with a _ doping - independent _ @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we try to answer these questions by studying the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model with the kotliar - ruckenstein slave - boson ( sb ) approach.@xcite the method well considers the af fluctuations for a wide range of interactions@xcite and has been used to study the stripes in hole - doped cuprates.@xcite we have found that , compared to the hf results , the af state derived from the sb approach has a much lower energy and the order parameter decreases much faster with doping .",
    "consequently , the arpes results can be reproduced under a constant @xmath3 .",
    "we start with the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model on a square lattice which reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 represent the nearest neighbor ( n.n . ) , second n.n . , and third n.n",
    ". sites , respectively , and the rest of the notation is standard . throughout the work @xmath0 is taken as the energy unit and typical parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are adopted .    in the spirit of the kotliar - ruckenstein sb approach,@xcite four auxiliary bosons",
    "@xmath21 are introduced at each site to label the four different states , which can be empty , singly occupied by an electron with spin up or down , or doubly occupied .",
    "the advantage of introducing bosons is that the interaction term can be linearized , i.e. , the product of density operators @xmath22 is replaced by @xmath23 , the occupation number operator for double occupancy . as the expense ,",
    "the hopping term becomes complicated because any hopping process of electrons must be accompanied by the transitions of slave bosons .",
    "explicitly , if an electron ( with spin @xmath24 ) hops from site @xmath25 to @xmath26 , the slave bosons must change simultaneously at both sites @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for example , at site @xmath25 , associated with the annihilation of the electron the bosonic state will transit either from the singly occupied one with spin @xmath24 to the empty one or from the doubly occupied one to the singly occupied one with spin @xmath27 .",
    "namely , the transition of the bosons at site @xmath25 can be described by the operator @xmath28 . to eliminate the unphysical states in the enlarged ( fermionic and bosonic ) hilbert space , the following constraints have to be imposed at each site : @xmath29 the first constraint states that a site is either empty , singly occupied , or doubly occupied . and the second one guarantees that , when an electron with spin @xmath24 locates at site @xmath25 , this site is either singly occupied with spin @xmath24 or doubly occupied .    in order to study the af order , we divide the lattice into two sublattices @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for sublattice @xmath32 ( @xmath33 )",
    ", we introduce a set of bosons @xmath34 , and lagrange multipliers @xmath35 which are associated with the constraints ( [ eq : cons1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cons2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus the original hamiltonian , with lagrange multiplier terms added , can be rewritten , in terms of fermionic operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 corresponding to sublattice @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , as follows    @xmath38    where the operators @xmath39 have been renormalized@xcite to ensure the exact result at @xmath40 even in mean - field treatment as adopted subsequently . with mean - field approximation , the bosons are replaced by _ c _ numbers and assumed to be site - independent on each sublattice , i.e. , @xmath41 ( and correspondingly @xmath42 ) . at the same time , the constraints are softened to be satisfied only on the average on each sublattice , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "this treatment is equivalent to making a saddle - point approximation in the path - integral formulation .",
    "now the hamiltonian becomes quadratic in terms of fermionic operators and can be easily diagonalized in momentum space .",
    "finally we have @xmath44 where the energy bands read    @xmath45/2 \\pm \\sqrt{[\\lambda_b^{\\sigma}-\\lambda_a^{\\sigma}+ ( z_{b\\sigma}^2-z_{a\\sigma}^2)\\varepsilon'_k]^2/4 + ( z_{a\\sigma}z_{b\\sigma}\\varepsilon_k)^2}\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 and the constant @xmath47\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above @xmath48 is the total number of lattice sites , @xmath49 is restricted to the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) , and the operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to @xmath36 and @xmath37 by unitary transformations .",
    "the grand canonical thermodynamic potential is given by [ @xmath52 with @xmath53 : temperature ] @xmath54 + e_0\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the chemical potential decided by @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the total number of electrons ) .",
    "all the parameters are determined to give the lowest free energy @xmath58 .",
    "the calculation will be simplified if we search for the af solution which satisfies the relations : @xmath59 .",
    "( correspondingly the energy bands @xmath60 become spin degenerate , i.e. , @xmath61 . )",
    "the staggered magnetization , which characterizes the af order , is given by @xmath62 .",
    "in the following we are limited to @xmath63 only at which the af long - range order is possible for the two - dimensional model .     for the af order to be stabilized at half filling : ( a ) @xmath64 vs @xmath65 when @xmath66 ( b ) @xmath64 vs @xmath2 at fixed @xmath67 [ blue ( black ) lines ] and @xmath68 [ red ( dark gray ) lines ] .",
    "all solid lines are from sb approach and dashed ones from hf theory.,width=321,height=151 ]    to look at the differences between sb and hf results , we first consider the half - filled case , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "as is well known , the pure @xmath0-@xmath3 ( with @xmath70 ) model takes on the af order for arbitrarily small @xmath71 due to the perfect nesting effect .",
    "after inclusion of the long - range hoppings , the af order will be frustrated and a critical @xmath72 is required to stabilize it .",
    "the relations between @xmath64 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 from both sb and hf approaches are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc ] . while fig .",
    "[ fig : uc](a ) shows @xmath64 vs @xmath1 when @xmath66 which has been given previously,@xcite we further present @xmath64 vs @xmath2 at fixed @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc](b ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath64 increases with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath64 at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained from sb approach is always larger than that from hf theory .",
    "this is expected in view that the hf theory overestimates the af order .",
    "once the fluctuations are taken into account , the critical value @xmath64 will be largely raised as seen in the sb approach .",
    "we notice that for parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 as adopted by kusko _",
    "et al._@xcite the accurate critical value is @xmath75 from sb approach rather than @xmath76 from hf theory .",
    "thus those values for doping - dependent @xmath3 selected by them,@xcite i.e. , @xmath77 at @xmath78 are actually unreasonable , which are already too small to stabilize the af order .    ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath79 .",
    "the red ( dark gray ) lines are from sb approach and black ones from hf theory .",
    "the dashed line in panel ( a ) shows that @xmath80 jumps to zero at @xmath81 in sb approach , and correspondingly the dashed one in panel ( b ) gives the energy at @xmath82.,width=264,height=340 ]    then we come to see how the af order declines with increasing doping @xmath83 under fixed @xmath3 . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the critical value at half filling is @xmath84(sb)@xmath85(hf ) .",
    "we choose @xmath86 and solve the self - consistent equations .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath80 as a function of @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : af](a ) , where the red ( dark gray ) and black lines are obtained from sb and hf approaches , respectively .",
    "it is seen that at half filling the af order derived from sb approach becomes weak relative to that from hf theory . and it is even weaker with increasing doping because @xmath80 decreases much faster in sb approach than in hf theory .",
    "in addition , we have found that the af state becomes energetically unfavorable at @xmath81 in sb approach , leading to a first - order transition as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : af](a ) .",
    "this first - order termination of the af order , compared to the claim of a quantum critical point,@xcite seems to be closer to the experimental observation where a steep disappearance of the af phase was found.@xcite also the doping range that the af order survives is quantitatively consistent with experiment.@xcite in contrast , @xmath80 keeps finite up to @xmath87 and goes to zero continuously in hf theory ( not shown ) .",
    "the corresponding ground state energies from both approaches are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : af](b ) .",
    "the energy derived from sb approach is notably lower than that from hf theory and the energy difference increases with increasing doping .",
    "this indicates that the study of the af property is largely improved within the sb approach .",
    "subsequently the energy bands @xmath88 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] , with red ( dark gray ) lines from sb approach and black ones from hf theory .",
    "( the definitions of @xmath89 in the magnetic bz have been analytically extended to the original bz . )",
    "while the upper bands derived from two approaches look similar at each doping , the lower bands take on different behaviors . within hf",
    "theory , the lower band shifts very slowly towards the fermi level with increasing doping and is still far away from it at @xmath9 . on the other hand , within sb approach ,",
    "the lower band lifts towards the fermi level as a whole . at @xmath90",
    "it is already rather close to the latter and may contribute the spectral intensity within the experimental resolution . at optimal doping , it is nearly crossed by the fermi level around @xmath8 .    in order to directly compare with the arpes data , we have calculated the spectral function @xmath91 within sb approach .",
    "the density plots for integration of @xmath91 times the fermi function over an energy interval @xmath92 $ ] mev ( same as that adopted in arpes experiments@xcite ) around the fermi level are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : akw ] by the top row . at low doping @xmath93 a small fs pocket forms around @xmath7 [ and equivalently @xmath94 . at doping @xmath90",
    "the spectral intensity begins to appear around @xmath8 , and becomes strong at optimal doping . at the same time",
    ", the fermi patch around @xmath7 deforms with increasing doping , i.e. , half of the fs around @xmath7 loses much of its intensity .",
    "the theoretical results agree well with the arpes data.@xcite for comparison , the corresponding plots from hf theory are shown by the bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig : akw ] , which , however , do not exhibit the main experimental features .",

    "the top row is from the sb approach and the bottom row from hf theory , under a doping - independent constant @xmath79 ( with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the lorentzian broadening is @xmath98.,width=325,height=215 ]",
    "in the above sections , after suitable consideration of the af fluctuations we have reached consistent results with arpes measurements under a doping - independent constant @xmath3 , in contrast with the previous argument for a doping - dependent @xmath3.@xcite the agreement is satisfactory in view that all input parameters except @xmath3 are extracted from experiments .",
    "we do not exclude that a tunable @xmath3 with doping will help lead to a perfect comparison between theory and experiment . even in this case , however , not a strong doping - dependence of @xmath3 as given by kusko _ et al . _",
    "( @xmath99% variation from @xmath12 to @xmath9)@xcite is needed .",
    "this may reconcile one of the discrepancies in recent explanations of both arpes and optical conductivity mentioned before .",
    "as for the magnitude of @xmath3 , an intermediate value @xmath100 is adopted here , which is somewhat too small at @xmath12 to produce the observed mott gap ( @xmath101 ev)@xcite in the parent compounds of electron - doped cuprates .",
    "a larger @xmath102 is expected , but it will be unfavorable to the appearance of the spectral intensity around @xmath8 in our current calculation . on the other hand , we should note that , if the af fluctuations are fully taken into account , an even quicker decreasing of @xmath80 with doping than displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : af](a ) will be the case .",
    "then a larger @xmath3 than adopted here , towards strong - coupling regime , could be chosen and fixed throughout the doping range , leading to the similar intensity maps shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : akw ] . the evaluation of the biggest @xmath3 available to explain the arpes data as well as the possibility to cross over to the strong - coupling model need further work.@xcite    in conclusion",
