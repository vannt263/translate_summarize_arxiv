    "the main goal of this paper is to present a detailed study of the relation between the rotated - electron site distribution configurations that emerge from the electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation @xcite and the momentum occupancy configurations of such quantum objects .",
    "clarification of this problem provides important information about the microscopic mechanisms that control the unusual finite - energy spectral properties of the model @xcite .",
    "the solution of the problem reported here involves the introduction of the concepts of a _ local pseudoparticle _ and an _ effective pseudoparticle lattice_. it is found that the bare - momentum pseudoparticle description associated with the bethe - ansatz takahasi s thermodynamic equations @xcite is related by fourier transforms to such a local - pseudoparticle representation .",
    "the latter representation refers to local - pseudoparticle occupancy configurations of spatial coordinates that correspond to an effective pseudoparticle lattice .",

    "finally , the application of the holon , spinon , and @xmath2 pseudoparticle description to the evaluation of the finite - energy spectral - weight distributions @xcite involves a second unitary transformation , which maps the @xmath2 pseudoparticles ( and composite @xmath67 or @xmath68 pseudoparticles ) onto @xmath2 pseudofermions ( and composite @xmath67 or @xmath68 pseudofermions ) and is defined in the _ pseudofermion subspace _",

    "in such a limit there is a huge degeneracy of @xmath0-spin and spin occupancy configurations .",

    "the pseudoparticle bare momentum obeys well defined boundary conditions which are a necessary condition for the fulfilment of the periodic boundary conditions for the original electrons .",

    "this description corresponds to a separation of the pseudoparticle translational and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter degrees of freedom are described by the @xmath66-site rotated - electron distribution configurations studied in the previous section . that internal structure is such that the @xmath67 pseudoparticle transforms as a @xmath0-spin zero quantum object under application of the off - diagonal generators of the @xmath0-spin @xmath1 algebra .",
    "in addition , such an internal structure is a necessary condition for the fulfilment of the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> the relation of the rotated - electron site distribution configurations that describe the energy eigenstates of the one - dimensional hubbard model to the momentum occupancy configurations of the same states associated with the bethe - ansatz quantum numbers is clarified . </S>",
    "<S> this allows an explicit study of the complex behavior that occurs for the electronic degrees of freedom , following the electron - rotated - electron unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior plays a central role in the non - perturbative mechanisms associated with the organization of the electronic degrees of freedom in terms of exotic objects whose momentum occupancy configurations describe the energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> our study involves the introduction of the concepts of _ local pseudoparticle _ and _ effective pseudoparticle lattice _ , </S>",
    "<S> needed for the relation of both the local pseudoparticle internal structure and the pseudoparticle occupancy configurations to the rotated - electron site distribution configurations . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide further useful information about the microscopic mechanisms behind the anomalous finite - energy spectral properties of low - dimensional complex materials . </S>"
