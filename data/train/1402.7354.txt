    "knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies has long been pivotal to the study and testing of galaxy formation and evolution theories , but an economical method for it s estimation has remained elusive to astronomers for decades ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the main reason for this is the fact that the galaxy photometry does nt sufficiently constrain the stellar mass , which is dependent on both the stellar populations of the galaxy and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of those populations .",
    "the imf represents the distribution of stellar masses at a single star formation event .",
    "the form of the imf is critical for estimating the mass of the galaxies and in understanding the stellar feedback and the chemical enrichment processes taking place within them .",
    "it is currently accepted , from direct star counts , that the imf shape in our milky way can be approximated by a power - law @xmath9 with the @xcite slope @xmath10 , above a stellar mass @xmath11  and a more shallow slope below @xmath12 @xcite . though this imf seems universal within the milky way its applicability to external galaxies has been uncertain for decades ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "early attempts , comparing the dynamical mass - to - light ratio",
    "m / l to the value inferred from stellar population synthesis , concluded that at least some spiral galaxies @xcite and etgs @xcite require an overall kroupa / chabrier mass normalization of the imf like the milky way . by studying the variation of the average m /",
    "l of galaxies in clusters at different redshifts , @xcite concluded that a salpeter imf slope was required for the mass range of @xmath13 .",
    "more recently @xcite studied near - infrared spectral features , where the contribution from dwarf stars is easier to measure .",
    "they concluded that massive elliptical galaxies have a dwarfs - dominated imf , unlike the milky way .",
    "@xcite studied the imf by comparing stellar masses from strong gravitational lensing to stellar masses from population synthesis .",
    "their models assume massive etgs are spherical , satisfy a power law dependence of imf normalization with galaxy mass , have dark halos following the mass - concentration relation predicted by simulation and the total to stellar mass derived by halo abundance matching .",
    "they concluded massive etgs as a class have a salpeter - like mass normalization of the imf .",
    "@xcite used more general axisymmetric dynamical models allowing for the imf , the stellar profiles , the halo slope and the stellar fraction to freely vary in different galaxies to reproduce the data .",
    "the models were constrained by integral - field stellar kinematics for a sample of 260 etgs spanning a large range of masses and @xmath14 .",
    "they found a systematic trend in the imf normalization .",
    "the average imf varies from kroupa / chabrier to salpeter and heavier with increasing @xmath14 , which was shown to trace the bulge fraction @xcite .",
    "a number of recent works appear so far consistent with a systematic imf variation .",
    "these used either spectral synthesis to study absorption features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however quantitative agreement between the different approaches has not yet been achieved and full consensus has not been reached ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the 1-d spectrum of the galaxies was obtained from the deep2 spectrographic survey @xcite .",
    "it is a magnitude limited , @xmath20 24.1 , galaxy redshift survey . in this study",
    ", we use the extended groth strip @xcite field of the survey due to the availability of hst imaging @xcite .",
    "the data was taken by the deimos multi - object spectrograph , mounted on the keck-2 telescope , with a observed wavelength range of 6500 - 9100 , in a spectral resolution of @xmath21 at 7800 .",
    "the typical total exposure time for each galaxy is 1 hour , with average seeing of @xmath22 .",
    "the 2-d spectra of the galaxies were observed using slitlets of dimensions 1@xmath23 .",
    "1-d spectra of the galaxies were then derived using the boxcar technique , within extraction windows of @xmath24 . due to the design of the survey ,",
    "the spectra of the objects are divided into 2 halves . for our study",
    ", we use the blue half of the wavelength range so as to observe the cak and g stellar lines for our given redshift range .",
    "a hst / acs survey of the egs was done by the go program 10134 [ p.i : m. davis ] @xcite .",
    "the survey was done with the f606w ( v ) and f814w ( i ) filters , at 5 @xmath14 magnitude limits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the observations were done in a four point dither pattern , which was processed by the stsdas multidrizzle package to produce a final mosaic of the field with a pixel scale of @xmath27 .",

    "these criteria reduced the sample to @xmath30 .",
    "the galaxy spectra were then logarithmically rebinned to 60  per spectral pixel and a signal - to - noise @xmath31 cut - off was applied .",
    "we visually inspected the spectra after their initial spectral fits ( section [ sec : ppxf ] ) and retained galaxies showing clear and well - fitted stellar absorption lines .",
    "this reduced the sample to @xmath32 .",
    "after the photometric analysis ( section [ sec : jam ] ) , a visual inspection of the contour fits of the galaxy photometry and the model was done to ensure that the models accurately reproduce the galaxy photometry , removing galaxies with non - axisymmetric features , e.g. disturbed morphology or strong dust .",
    "this reduced our sample to 87 .",
    "another selection criterion implemented on our galaxy sample was that of luminosity - weighted age of the galaxies , derived by identifying the best - fitting single stellar population model with solar metallicity via full - spectrum fitting .",
    "galaxies with best - fitting template age < 1.2 gyr were removed .",
    "a similar selection was made by @xcite who found that young galaxies have strong stellar population gradients , hence breaking the assumption of constant stellar m / l .",
    "finally we removed galaxies with strong evidence for multiple population using full - spectrum fitting ( section [ sec : pop ] ) , leading to a final sample of 68 galaxies .",

    "more information on these galaxies will be given in a follow up paper .",
    "to create dynamical models for our galaxies , we first extracted reliable velocity dispersion for the galaxies , using the ppxf code @xcite .",
    "the spectrum fitting was done with a subset of 53 stellar spectra taken from the indo - us library of coud feed stellar spectra library @xcite .",

    "a bootstrapping technique was used to estimate the real errors on the derived single aperture velocity dispersions .",
    "the technique involved re - sampling the residuals between the observed spectrum and an initial best fit .",
    "the bootstrapped spectra are then fitted with an `` optimal '' template which is the summation of the templates used for the initial fit of the spectrum , multiplied with their respective weights .",
    "the process was iterated 500 times , and the distribution of the stellar kinematic values was used to estimate the velocity dispersion and its error .",
    "we compare our derived velocity dispersion with that of @xcite , for our 40 common galaxies , using the lts_linefit routine , modified to constrain the slope to 1 .",
    "we find that our velocity dispersion are consistent with those of @xcite with negligible offset of @xmath36 dex and an observed rms scatter of 0.094 dex .",

    "we assume for all galaxies the average inclination @xmath2 for random orientations ( @xmath39 being edge - on ) .",
    "for a few galaxies for which this inclination is not allowed by the deprojection of the mge model , we assign the lowest allowed inclination .",
    "we adopt an anisotropy @xmath1 which is the typical value , within one half - light radius , for early type galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown the @xmath7 to be very weakly sensitive to the adopted inclination ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  4 ) .",
    "but our quoted errors do not include the effect of our constant anisotropy assumption .",
    "given our lack of spatially resolved data , we are unable to separate luminous and dark matter in our galaxies .",

    "the extensive modelling study of @xcite measure a low dark matter fraction ( @xmath43 ) , within @xmath44 , for nearby galaxies of similar mass as ours .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite provide a general argument as to why dark matter should further decrease with increasing redshift .",

    ", our @xmath7 would only provide an upper limit to the imf mass normalization .",
    "we use the parametrization of the photometry and the redshift of the galaxies to derive their absolute magnitude .",

    "the m / l derived from these template sets are offset by only 0.07 dex and have an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex .",
