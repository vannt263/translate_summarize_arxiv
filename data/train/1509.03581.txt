    "the experimentally observed large change of the entropy , i.e. 14.0 mj / g / k @xcite or 12.58 mj / g / k @xcite , is mainly attributed to the electronic contribution related to spin fluctuations on the rh atoms .",

    "the reversibility of this transition and the small relaxation time makes it attractive for applications .",
    "transport measurements demonstrate a strong drop of the electrical resistivity during the metamagnetic phase transition @xcite from the afm to the fm state .",
    "as the metamagnetic transition can be manipulated by an external magnetic field , this feature of the resistivity leads to a giant magnetoresistance phenomena in the system around @xmath2 , that makes ferh an appealing material for future data storage devices @xcite .",

    "the rh - related electronic states for both of the dos spin channels in these cases exhibits hybridization with fe minority - spin states ( essentially , above the fermi energy ) and majority - spin states ( below the fermi energy ) , in line with the discussion by sandratskii and mavropoulos @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that in the afm state the vanishing total magnetic moment on the rh site is a result of the hybridization - governed redistribution of spin density and not because of vanishing spin density within the rh atomic site .",
    "the dos    note also , that the rh dos at the fermi level is rather small and , therefore , a pronounced stoner enhancement of the magnetic moment induced on rh can be ruled out .",

    ", these results demonstrate the following effects of increasing magnetic disorder : ( i ) a stabilization of the fm state with respect to the afm state and ( ii ) the stability of the fm state is a result of the decrease of the rh magnetic moment .    therefore , when discussing the driving forces behind the metamagnetic afm - fm phase transition , other additional effects than just the magnetization of the rh sublattice have to be considered .",

    "the magnetic moment of rh is induced by a spin dependent hybridization of its electronic states with the electronic states of surrounding fe atoms .",

    "the interaction with the third fe neighbor depends only weakly on the reference state , while the interactions with the first neighbour are close to @xmath43  mev in the case of fm reference state and is about @xmath44   mev for the afm state .",
    "since the rh magnetic moment in the afm state is equal to @xmath45 , it does not contribute to the magnetic energy . as a consequence",
    "only the fe - fe exchange interactions are responsible for the stabilization of this state .",
    "in contrast to this situation , the fm order in the system can be stabilized by a rather strong fe - rh interaction since the rh magnetic moments are non - zero , giving a negative contribution to the magnetic energy competing with the positive one due to the fe - fe interatomic exchange .",
    "thus , the transition from the afm to fm state is essentially a result of the competition of these interactions .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the fm and afm energy variation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_etot_ndlm ] and demonstrating the stabilization of the fm state upon increase of the magnetic disorder , can be attributed to the modification of the fe - fe exchange coupling parameters , in particular , to a strong decrease of the afm interactions with the first neighbors . in the dlm state",
