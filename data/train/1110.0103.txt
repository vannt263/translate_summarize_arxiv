    "major internal components are created using materials known to have high radiopurity , e.g. ofhc cu , hdpe , and ptfe . a radiopurity screening program , similar to that used for lux , will be implemented for selection of materials for all major internal items , ensuring that internal backgrounds are limited below goals .",
    "the lux collaboration identified several highly radiopure samples of ti ( @xmath40.4  mbq / kg @xmath5u , @xmath40.8  mbq / kg @xmath6th , @xmath41.6  mbq / kg @xmath12k ) , enabling the use of that material for construction of the inner and outer cryostat vessels .",
    "ti is a very attractive option for cryostat construction due to its strength , cleanliness , and relative transparency to gamma rays , in comparison with steel and cu which are typically used for construction of cryogenic vessels .",
    "gamma transparency is attractive when using an external scintillator veto , which can catch escaping gammas to provide rejection of some intrinsic backgrounds ( sec .",

    "the same digitizers will also provide data acquisition functionality , replacing the vme - based lux daq system .",
    "the self - shielding properties of liquid xe are extremely advantageous in the rejection of gamma backgrounds .",
    "unfortunately , the self - shielding makes it extremely difficult to calibrate the detector with external gamma sources . for liquid xe tpcs the size of lux or greater , external calibration sources are grossly inefficient at producing low - energy er events within the fiducial volume . for this reason ,",
    "internal calibration sources are being developed and deployed for testing in lux , with an eye toward adaptation for the lz detectors .",
    "these sources will maximize calibration efficiency at the center of the detector for both fixed- and variable - energy calibrations , which will set the light yield scale at the wimp search region and determine er rejection capability , respectively .    for fixed - energy calibrations , @xmath13kr@xmath14 is a favored candidate @xcite .",
    "@xmath13kr@xmath14 generates two conversion electrons at 32.1 and 9.4  kev , separated by a characteristic time of 154  ns .",
    "the characteristic time separation is long enough to be easily distinguished during analysis .",
    "the 1.8  hr half - life of @xmath13kr@xmath14 quickly reduces the source activity below appreciable levels on the time scale of days , and the signature of the isotope allows any residual contamination to be easily rejected during dark matter searches .",
    "variable - energy calibrations can be accomplished with a beta emitter .",
    "one particular candidate under investigation is tritium , with a q - value of 18.6  kev .",
    "tritium would be introduced in the form of tritiated methane .",
    "removal of tritiated methane at ppm levels from gaseous xe has been achieved with efficiencies exceeding 99.98% @xcite .",
    "significant advances in purification must be attained before use in liquid xenon , as background subdominance of the tritiated methane beta signature requires it to be present at levels @xmath410@xmath15",
    "g / g in xe in lux , and @xmath410@xmath16  g / g in lzd , during wimp searches .",
    "a major addition to the lz detectors is the presence of an organic scintillator volume surrounding the active region .",
    "the scintillator will be instrumented with large - area pmts , and will serve primarily to enhance rejection of internal backgrounds , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : internal - backgrounds ] .",
    "the scintillator will likely be operated at liquid xe temperatures to enhance light yields @xcite , though development work remains to be completed to determine the impact of temperature on scintillator transparency , as well as explore an optimal cooling strategy and additional cryogenic safety concerns .",
    "the lz detectors will use a water shield to eliminate external backgrounds in a configuration similar to that of lux .",
    "the lux 8  m @xmath2 6  m water shield is equipped with 20 large - area pmts which allow the water shield to provide cherenkov veto functionality .",
    "the lzs detector will use the existing lux water shield , as the lzs active region represents a modest scale - up in linear dimensions , and the layer of scintillator surrounding the active region will greatly supplement background reduction .",
    "lzd will use a 12  m @xmath2 12  m water shield with comparable or improved cherenkov veto efficiency , which reduces external backgrounds far below significance ( sec .",
    "[ sub : external - backgrounds ] ) .",
    "liquid xe detectors greatly benefit from increases in mass , as the efficiency of their self - shielding capability dramatically increases as well . for a gamma or neutron to create a false wimp signature , the particle must pass several cm into the detector , scatter through a small angle corresponding to a low energy deposition , and escape the detector without scattering again .",
    "the probability of escape drops exponentially with increases to linear detector dimension .",
    "the increased size of the lz detectors ( 50  cm @xmath2 50  cm for lux ; 85  cm @xmath2 85  cm or 1  m @xmath2 1  m for lzs 1.5 or 3  tonne respectively ; 2  m @xmath2 2  m for lzd ) will greatly aid rejection of backgrounds from both external and internal sources .",
    "however , background requirements for these detectors also become much more stringent as experiment running times increase .",
    "the increase in xe mass and detector surface area also increases sensitivity to backgrounds which were not significant for smaller detectors .",
    "an extensive search has been performed to understand these background sources .",
    "external backgrounds are generated primarily from muon spallation events in the rock , as well as muon capture in the detector water shield itself .",
    "both event types produce a high - energy neutron flux which is able to penetrate to the fiducial volume of the detector with non - negligible efficiency .",
    "extensive modeling work performed for the lux experiment indicates that these background sources will remain subdominant to internal backgrounds . as lzs will use the existing lux water shield and will offer enhanced self - shielding , these backgrounds are not considered to be significant for lzs either .",

    "care will be taken during the manufacturing process to keep all major internals under active n@xmath8 purge in order to limit rn exposure .",
    "the increase in xenon mass for the lz detectors brings a corresponding increase in sensitivity to intrinsic xenon backgrounds which were not considered for previous detectors .",
    "of particular concern are a class of isotopes which undergo `` naked '' or `` semi - naked '' beta decay , meaning that the decay has a significant probability of emitting a beta without an accompanying gamma which would enhance veto capabilities .",
    "naked beta decays produce no accompanying gamma , while semi - naked beta decays produce an accompanying gamma with enough energy to potentially escape the active region .",
    "one notable example of a naked beta emitter is @xmath18bi , a member of the @xmath5u decay chain , which can be introduced into the xenon through rn emanation from detector internals .",
    "activation of xe through muon capture , neutron capture , or fast neutron activation is also of concern .",
