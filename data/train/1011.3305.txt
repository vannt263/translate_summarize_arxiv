    "classical cepheids are the key standard candles , which are used to set the zero point of the extragalactic distance scale @xcite and also serve as young - population tracers of great importance @xcite .",
    "they owe their popularity to their high luminosities and photometric variability ( which make them easy to identify and observe even at large distances ) and the fact that the luminosities , intrinsic colours , and ages of these stars are closely related to such an easy to determine quantity as the variability period",
    ".    it would be best to calibrate the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) , period - colour ( pc ) , and period - luminosity - colour relations via distances based on trigonometric parallaxes , however , the most precisely measured parallaxes of even the nearest cepeheids remain insufficiently accurate and , more importantly , they may be fraught with so far uncovered systematic errors . here the baade ",
    "wesselink method @xcite comes in handy , because it allows the cepheid distances ( along with the physical parameters of these stars ) to be inferred , thereby providing an independent check for the results based on geometric methods ( e.g. , trigonometric and statistical parallax ) .    however , all the so far proposed versions of the baade  becker  wesselink method ( surface brightness technique @xcite , maximum - likelihood technique @xcite ) depend , in one way or another , on the adopted reddening value .",
    "both techniques are based on the same astrophysical background but make use somewhat different calibrations ( limb - darkened surface brightness parameter , bolometric correction  effective temperature pair ) on the normal colour . here",
    "we propose a generalization of the @xcite technique , which allows one to independently determine not only the star s distance and physical parameters , but also the amount of interstellar reddening , and even calibrate the dependence of a linear combination of the bolometric correction and effective temperature on intrinsic colour .",
    "we now briefly outline the method .",
    "first , the bolometric luminosity of a star at any time instant is given by the following relation , which immediately follows from the stefan  boltzmann law : @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the star s bolometric luminosity , radius , and effective temperature , respectively , and the @xmath5 subscript denotes the corresponding solar values . given that the bolometric absolute magnitude @xmath6 is related to bolometric luminosity as @xmath7 we can simply derive from eq .",
    "( 1 ) : @xmath8 now , the bolometric absolute magnitude @xmath6 can be written in terms of the absolute magnitude @xmath9 in some photometric band and the corresponding bolometric correction @xmath10 : @xmath11 and the absolute magnitude @xmath9 can be written as : @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the star s apparent magnitude and interstellar extinction in the corresponding photometric band , respectively , and @xmath15 is the heliocentric distance of the star in pc .",
    "we can therefore rewrite eq .",
    "( 3 ) as follows : @xmath16 @xmath17 let us introduce the function @xmath18 , the apparent distance modulus @xmath19 , and rewrite eq .",
    "( 7 ) as the light curve model : @xmath20 where constant @xmath21",
    "we now recall that interstellar extinction @xmath14 can be determined from the colour excess @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total - to - selective extinction ratio for the passband - colour pair considered , whereas @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are rather precisely known quantities .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is a function of intrinsic colour index @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite used a very crude approximation for the effective temperature and bolometric correction , reducing the right - hand of the light curve model ( eq .",
    "7 ) to the linear function of the observed colour , with the coefficients containing the colour excess in a latent form .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite used non - linear approximation in eq .",
    "( 7 ) to calculate cepheid radii .",
    "the key point of our approach is that the values of function @xmath30 are computed from the already available calibrations of bolometric correction @xmath31 and effective temperature @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "these calibrations are expressed as high - order power series in the intrinsic colour : @xmath33 with known @xmath34 and @xmath35 amounting to @xmath36 ; in some cases the decomposition also includes the metallicity ( @xmath37 $ ] ) and/or gravity ( @xmath38 ) terms .    as for the star s",
    "radius @xmath3 , its current value can be determined by integrating the star s radial - velocity curve over time ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the radius value at the phase @xmath42 ( we use mean radius , @xmath43 ) ; @xmath44 , the systemic radial velocity ; @xmath45 , the current phase of the radial velocity curve ; @xmath46 , the star s pulsation period , and @xmath47 is the projection factor that accounts for the difference between the pulsation and radial velocities .",
    "given the observables ( light curve  apparent magnitudes @xmath13 , colour curve ",
    "apparent colour indices @xmath48 , and radial velocity curve  @xmath49 ) and known quantities for the sun , we end up with the following unknowns : distance @xmath15 , mean radius @xmath50 , and colour excess @xmath22 , which can be simply found by the least - squares or maximum likelihood technique .    in the case of cepheids with large amplitudes of light and colour curves ( @xmath51 )",
    "it is also possible to apply a more general technique by setting the expansion coefficients @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 8) free and treating them as unknowns .",
    "we expanded the function @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) into a power series about the intrinsic colour index @xmath53 of a well - studied `` standard '' star ( e.g. , @xmath54 per or some other bright star ) with accurately known @xmath55 : @xmath56    the best fit to the light curve is provided with the optimal expansion order @xmath57 .",
    "we use this modification to calculate the physical parameters and reddening @xmath22 of the cepheid , as well as the calibration @xmath0 for the given metallicity @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "our sources of data include berdnikov s extensive multicolor photoelectric and ccd photometry of classical cepheids  @xcite and very accurate radial - velocity measurements of 165 northern cepheids  @xcite taken in 1987 - 2009 ( about 10500 individual observations ) with a coravel - type spectrometer @xcite .",
    "these data sets are nearly synchronous , to prevent any systematic errors in the computed radii and other parameters due to the evolutionary period changes resulting in phase shifts between light , colour and radial velocity variations @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath27 = 5777 k , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we proceeded from @xmath59 data and found the best solutions for the @xmath60-band light curve and @xmath61 color curve to be those computed using the @xmath62 function based on two calibrations @xcite of similar slope ( see fig .  2  e ) ; the poorer results obtained using the other cited calibrations can be explained by the fact that the latter involved insufficient number of supergiant stars .",
    "there is yet no consensus concerning the projection factor ( pf ) value to be used for cepheid variables  @xcite .",
    "different authors use constant values ranging from 1.27 to 1.5 , as well as pfs depending on the pulsation period and other parameters .",
    "different approaches lead to small systematic differences in the inferred cepheid parameters , first of all , in the radii . based on geometrical considerations ,",
    "@xcite derived phase - dependent pfs as simple three - parametric analytic expressions depending on the pulsation velocity , limb darkening coefficient , and spectral line broadening , adjusted to coravel radial velocities of cepheids .",
    "we suspect that the period dependence reflects mainly the dependence of the pf on limb darkening .",
    "to compare our results with other calculations , we finally adopted a moderate dependence of pf on the period advocated by  @xcite : @xmath63 though we repeated all calculations with other variants of pf dependence on the period and pulsation phase to assure the stability of the calculated colour excess .",
    "to test the new method , we used the maximum likelihood technique to solve eq .",
    "( 7 ) for the @xmath60-band light curve and @xmath64 colour curve for several classical cepheids residing in young open clusters : sz  tau ( ngc  1647 ) , cf  cas ( ngc  7790 ) , u  sgr ( ic  4725 ) , dl  cas ( ngc  129 ) , gy  sge ( anonymous ob - association  @xcite ) as well as for approximately 30 field cepheids from our sample . we found two @xmath65 calibrations  those of  @xcite and  @xcite  combined with the @xmath66 calibration as a function of normal colour @xmath67 proposed by  @xcite  to yield the best fit to the observed @xmath60-band light curve via eq .",
    "a weak sensitivity of calculated reddening , @xmath68 , to the adopted pf value ( constant or period / phase  dependent ) and to the derived @xmath50 value can be explained by very strong dependence of the light curve s amplitude on the effective temperature , @xmath69 , and , as a consequence , on the dereddened colour .    though the internal errors of the reddening @xmath68 seem to be very small , the values determined using the two best calibrations , @xcite and @xcite , may differ by as much as @xmath70 , due to the systematic shift between these two calibrations ( fig .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the inferred parameters for the cluster cepheids studied .",
    "1 shows the observed and smoothed data and the final fit to the @xmath60-band light curve for u  sgr cepheid .",
    "our reddenings seem to agree well with the corresponding webda values , particularly if we remember that the errors of the adopted cluster reddening estimates are as high as @xmath71 .",
    "our next step will be to make use of the calibrations of @xmath72 and @xmath10 as a function of red and infrared colours @xmath73 and to compare derived reddening ratios with the conventional extinction laws .",
    "note that the inferred radius and luminosity of sz  tau are too large for its short period ; this cepheid probably pulsates in the @xmath74 or even in the @xmath75 overtone , as may be indirectly evidenced by its low colour amplitude ( about @xmath76 ) .",
    "2 shows the observed data , the fit to the @xmath60-band light curve , and the inferred calibration @xmath77 vs @xmath67 ) calculated for tt  aql cepheid ( as a @xmath78-order expansion in the normal colour ) .",
    "the inferred calibration is very close to that of @xcite .",

    "aql , @xmath84 . in some cases",
    "( with large amplitude of color variation ) the `` free '' calibration ( eq .  10 ) can markedly improve the model fit to the observed light curve of the cepheid variable .",
    "2  f shows the example of calibrations of the @xmath30 functions derived from nine cepheids with different metallicity and surface gravity values .",
    "temperature difference at @xmath85 is amounted to @xmath86 .    when applied to an extensive sample of cepheid variables with homogeneous photometric data and detailed radial velocity curves ,",
    "the new method is expected to give a completely independent scale of reddenings , a new period - colour - luminosity relation , and a new distance scale for the milky - way cepheids .",
