    "the remarkable changes in cluster disk galaxy populations between intermediate redshifts ( z @xmath2 0.5 ) and the present are well known . up to 50% of the population of intermediate redshift clusters",
    "are comprised of blue , star - forming galaxies , which have been shown to be predominantly normal spiral and irregular galaxies , a fraction of which are interacting or obviously disturbed . by the present epoch , this population has been depleted by a factor of 2 and replaced by a population of s0 galaxies .",
    "however the processes by which this has occurred are still not fully understood ( cf .",
    "dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 )    the processes which cause the transformation of the cluster spiral galaxy population to s0s are expected to have very significant effects on cluster galaxy star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "we have undertaken a comparison of sfrs between field and cluster spirals in 8 low redshift clusters in order to investigate whether these sfrs show evidence of continuing morphological transformation of disk galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "the comparison survey , details of which are published elsewhere ( moss , whittle & irwin 1988 ; moss & whittle 1993 ; moss , whittle & pesce 1998 ; moss & whittle 1999 ) uses h@xmath0 emission , resolved into disk and circumnuclear emission , as an estimator of the sfrs .",
    "our cluster sample ( viz . galaxies in 8 clusters abell 262 , 347 , 400 , 426 , 569 , 779 , 1367 and 1656 ) , and our field sample ( viz . galaxies in adjacent supercluster fields ) were observed in an identical manner , thus eliminating systematic effects in detection efficiency .",
    "furthermore , both ( supercluster ) field and cluster samples approximated volume limited samples , largely eliminating the systematic bias between cluster and field detection rates which may have been present in many earlier comparison studies ( cf .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a difficult question is which criterion to choose to normalise field and cluster disk galaxy samples . some authors ( e.g. hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 ; balogh et al .",
    "1998 ) have chosen to use bulge to disk ( b / d ) ratio on the grounds that it is a less subjective and star formation contaminated normalisation parameter . however",
    "the relation between b / d ratio and hubble t - type has considerable scatter ( baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ; de jong 1995 ) such that an increase in the s0/s ratio in clusters is likely to mask systematic changes of sfr between field and cluster spirals .",
    "since the latter changes are of interest for the present study , the b / d ratio is not a suitable normalisation parameter .",
    "accordingly we have chosen hubble type as the normalisation parameter , and further restricted field and cluster samples to a total of 320 spirals ( sa and later ) and peculiars .",
    "some 39% of spirals and 75% of peculiars were detected in h@xmath0 emission .",
    "it is estimated that emission detection is 90% complete to an equivalent width limit of 20  , and @xmath2 29% efficient below this limit ( cf .",
    "moss et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the detected emission divides approximately equally between _ diffuse _ and _ compact _ emission which is identified with disk emission and circumnuclear starburst emission respectively .",
    "examples of both types of emission are given in figure 1 .    a particular difficulty which arises in adopting the hubble type as the normalisation parameter is the relation between the star formation properties of the galaxy and its hubble type . in particular ,",
    "a decrease in disk star formation rate may shift a galaxy to an earlier type .",
    "this shift in type may not be detected in any comparison of field and cluster spirals ( hashimoto et al .",
    "this makes any comparison of _ disk _ emission between field and cluster spirals uncertain . by contrast , circumnuclear emission is relatively independent of type ( kennicutt 1998 ) , and in this case a reliable comparison of field and cluster spirals is possible .    as is characteristic of circumnuclear starburst emission ( cf .",
    "kennicutt 1998 ) , the detected compact emission correlates with both a disturbed morphology of the galaxy ( significance level , 8.7@xmath3 ) indicative of tidally - induced star formation , and with the presence of a bar ( significance level , 3.1@xmath3 ) .",
    "furthermore this emission correlates with both local galaxy surface density ( significance level , 3.9@xmath3 ) and cluster central galaxy space density ( significance level , 5.3@xmath3 ) . since there is no significant difference in the incidence of galaxy bars between the field and cluster samples ,",
    "whereas disturbed galaxies are more common in the cluster environment , it is considered that the observed enhancement of circumnuclear emission is due to tidally - induced star formation , whether from galaxy  galaxy , galaxy  group or galaxy  cluster interactions .",
    "finally , the enhancement of circumnuclear starburst emission with increasing cluster density is not wholly accounted for by the correlation of this emission with local galaxy surface density .",
    "a kendall partial rank correlation test shows an additional cluster effect ( significance level , 3.3@xmath3 ) such that there is a higher incidence of circumnuclear emission for galaxies in a region of a given local galaxy surface density in richer clusters , as compared to that for galaxies in regions of the same surface density in poorer clusters .",
    "although lavery & henry ( 1988 ) first proposed that the butcher - oemler effect could be explained as star formation triggered by galaxy  galaxy interactions in intermediate redshift clusters , it was long considered that the typical cluster velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 1000 @xmath4 @xmath5 ) was too high for strong tidal interactions to occur .",
    "however recent work ( e.g. gnedin 1999 ) has shown that a non - static cluster potential can enhance tidal interactions for cluster galaxies .",
    "such a non - static potential can arise in sub - cluster merging , and indeed there is evidence that the two richest clusters in our sample ( abell 1367 and 1656 ) are recent post - merger systems ( donnelly et al . 1998",
    "; honda et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it appears that the merger events in these clusters leading to a rapidly varying cluster potential , may have caused an increase in galaxy tidal interactions and the associated observed enhancement of circumnuclear starburst emission .",
    "tidal interactions of galaxies in clusters are likely to be an effective mechanism for the transformation of spirals to s0 galaxies ( e.g. gnedin 1999 ) . it was noted above that the observed enhancement of circumnuclear emission in spirals with increasing cluster density is not wholly accounted for by that due to increasing local galaxy surface density .",
    "this implies that tidal interactions , and associated morphological transformation of spirals to s0s , proceeds faster in richer as compared to poorer clusters , perhaps because sub - cluster merging is more common for the former .",
    "this in turn may explain the hitherto anomalous absence of a type  local galaxy surface density ( @xmath6 ) relation in irregular clusters at intermediate redshift ( dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . whereas significant morphological transformation of the cluster disk galaxy population may be expected for regular ( rich ) clusters at @xmath7 (",
    "for which the timescale for transformation is shorter ) and for irregular ( poor ) clusters at @xmath8 ( for which a longer time duration for transformation is available ) , for irregular clusters at @xmath7 , there has been insufficient time for this to take place , leading to the observed absence of a @xmath6 relation ."
