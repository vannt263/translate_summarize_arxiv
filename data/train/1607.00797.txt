    "the unexpected effects of quantum correlations were initially described by einstein , podolsky and rosen in their 1935 paper @xcite as a phenomenon questioning the completeness of quantum mechanics . the natural proposal to overcome the problems raised therein was to assume the existence of hidden variables : additional parameters are not present in the quantum mechanical description , but which characterize the behavior and evolution of a quantum system .    in 1964 , however , john bell @xcite proposed an inequality that must be satisfied by any local hidden - variable alternative to quantum mechanics .",
    "it turns out that quantum mechanics violates this inequality , and thus , no local hidden - variable theory can reproduce its full predictions .",
    "bell s inequality was further generalized in 1969 by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt @xcite , and many versions of bell - type inequalities have been proposed since then @xcite .",
    "epr - correlations have been a research topic in the field of particle physics . in particular , the system of neutral kaons exhibits interesting quantum correlations which have been studied since the discovery of the kaons in the 1960 s . due to the strangeness quantum number",
    "the neutral kaon and ist antiparticle are different states , allowing for a description as a two state system . however ,",
    "due to the decay of the kaons , the time - evolution of the two - state system is non - unitary .",
    "the details can be found in particle physics textbooks ( see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; in the context of quantum optics this has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    treating the system of neutral kaons as a two - state system allows us to draw some analogies to photons @xcite , but existing approaches suffered from a series of shortcomings @xcite .",
    "the most important issues were problems with the normalization of the state of the decaying system , the difficulty of choosing an active method to measure the quasi - spin @xcite and the difficult problem of a generalization to a higher number of particles .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors proposed a reformulation of the problem in terms of an effective operator formalism . here ,",
    "the time evolution of the system as well as the measurement angles can be incorporated into an effective operator that offers a series of advantages over the direct photon - analogy method : by including the non - unitary time evolution into the effective operator , one ensures that normalization is only performed with respect to the surviving particles .",
    "another advantage is the possibility to generalize it to an arbitrary number of particles just by the usual tensor product . finally , an interesting property of neutral kaons , namely the violation of cp - symmetry is easily included within the formalism .    in this paper",
    ", we present a generalization of this approach to general decay processes and apply it to trapped ion systems . in detail , the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the physics of neutral kaons and the existing approaches to effective operators . in section iii",
    "we describe our generalized approach .",
    "section iv presents an application to kaons and various bell inequalities in this setting .",
    "section v describes applications to trapped ions such as @xmath0yb or @xmath1yb , which may be used to simulate kaonic behavior in quantum optics .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss possible further directions of research .",
    "in this section we give a brief summary of the quantum mechanics of the neutral kaon system , which sets the stage for the further considerations .",
    "the neutral kaons are composed of a strange quark and a down anti - quark , where the strange quark carries a quantum number called strangeness . due this quantum number",
    "we can distinguish the neutral kaon from its antiparticle @xmath2 the second relevant quantum number is related to the behaviour of the kaons under charge conjugation @xmath3 and parity @xmath4 . since the kaons are pseudoscalar particles , one obtains ( making a choice for a possible arbitrary phase ) @xmath5 in particular , @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not commute and hence there are no common eigenstates ; in fact , we may construct the cp eigenstates from the strangeness eigenvectors to be @xmath8    neutral kaons are produced by generating an @xmath9 pair , which hadronizes into strange particles . a particularly clean way is pursued at @xmath10 at frascati : the kaons are generated from the decay of a @xmath11 meson , which consists of two strange quarks , but is heavy enough to ( exclusively ) decay into a pair of neutral kaons .",
    "the @xmath11 meson has a definite @xmath7 quantum number and the kaon state in the moment of the decay of the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath13    kaons decay through weak interaction processes , the relevant weak transition is the decay of the strange quark into an up quark .",
    "hence the possible final states are either two or three pions , since there is no phase space for heavier states .",
    "however , the two- and three - pion states with vanishing orbital angular momentum @xmath14 have different cp eigenvalues , @xmath15 thus , if @xmath7 were conserved , the @xmath16 could decay exclusively to two pions , while @xmath17 could only decay into three pions . since the phase space for the decay into three pions is much smaller than the one for the decay into two pions",
    ", the @xmath17 has a significantly longer lifetime .",
    "weak interactions mediate not only the decays of the kaons , but also an effect called mixing .",
    "since the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 have common decay channels @xmath20 , a @xmath18 state can oscillate into a @xmath19 state through the process @xmath21 .",
    "thus the neutral kaon states undergo a mixing which in the two - dimensional space of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is described by a hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are hermitean @xmath25 matrices . note that this hamiltonian takes into account the decay of the kaons through the contribution of @xmath24 , which makes the total hamiltonian non - hermitean .    assuming first that cp is a good quantum number , the two @xmath7 eigenstates ( [ cp1 ] ) and ( [ cp2 ] ) are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and the eigenvalue equation reads @xmath26 the eigenvalues are complex , since @xmath27 is non - hermitean .",
    "we decompose them into real and imaginary parts as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the masses of the short and long - lived states and @xmath30 are the decay widths .",
    "note that @xmath31 , so @xmath32 is the width of the short - lived , while @xmath33 is the one of the long - lived kaon .",
    "furthermore , if cp were conserved , we would have @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq:8 ] ) is non - hermitean , which not only leads to complex eigenvalues , but also the eigenvectors are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "we make a choice of the relative phases of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38    weak interactions violate the cp symmetry ; in fact this was discovered in the system of neutral kaons . as a consequence , @xmath7 and @xmath27 do not commute and thus the cp eigenstates ( [ cp1],[cp2 ] ) are not identical to the eigenstates @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the hamiltonian . to this end ,",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian become @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and only if cp is conserved we have @xmath41",
    ". however , cp violation is a small effect ; rewriting the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath37 and @xmath36 in terms of the cp eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath42 we define the @xmath7 violating parameter @xmath43 , which has a value of approximately @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that there is cp - violation observed in the neutral kaon system , shown here by the non - zero @xmath45 parameter leads to a slight non - orthogonality of the short and long - lived states .    including @xmath7 violation , the total time evolution of the kaon system",
    "is then given by @xmath46 with the time - dependent functions @xmath47 the lifetime difference in the kaon system is substantial : the lifetimes of the two states are : @xmath48 for the short - lived state @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the long - lived state @xmath51 .",
    "there are two physical properties of neutral kaons that make them important for our model : the first one is decay as the system is represented by the two states with different lifetimes .",
    "the second property is flavour oscillation . as the state @xmath52 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) evolves in time , the particles undergo mixing , essentially an oscillation between particle and antiparticle ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) ) .",
    "this type of behaviour is known as neutral particle oscillation and will prove useful to us , as we will want to make our measurements at different times , by performing the measurement on one particle and allowing the other to evolve for an additional time @xmath53 , before measuring .",
    "this effectively allows to measure the spin in different directions .      for a system of two particles of spin-1/2",
    ", one can select four settings for the directions of the corresponding spins ( two for each particle , say @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for alice s particle and @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for bob s particle ) .",
    "these can be used as parameters for the chsh inequality @xcite @xmath58 where the bound is valid for local realistic theories and can be violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "one can define a quasi - spin quantity , for neutral kaons , with the parametrization @xmath59 and thus give the possibility to the experimenter of choosing different quasi - spin directions .",
    "one must be careful though , there is no arbitrary spin direction in this case , one only has the choice of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , due to the fact that only strangeness or lifetime measurements can be performed .    for a certain quasi - spin direction @xmath64 at a certain measurement time @xmath65",
    ", the expectation value can be written in terms of the probability of obtaining a @xmath66 [ denoted here by y(yes ) @xmath67 n(no ) ] as @xmath68 noteworthy is the fact that the probability @xmath69 does not only include the case of detecting a @xmath70 , but also non - detection events .",
    "using our parametrization and the fact that @xmath71,\\ ] ] we can find an operator that satisfies the property @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is called an `` effective operator '' .    with this , the matrix form of the effective operator in the lifetime eigenbasis is    @xmath74    as can be constructed by following the derivations in ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath75 . here , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the decay constants of the short and long - lived states .",
    "a few remarks are in order : first , from the matrix form of this operator , we see that for large times , when the probability that the particles have decayed is very high , the effective operator tends to minus identity .",
    "this is a reasonable expectation , since , as the particles decay , the overall amount of detection events decreases .",
    "second , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) it is easy to see that in the case of a multi - particle system the generalization is straightforward : @xmath78 .",
    "the experimental set - up of a bell - test is rather standard : a pair of particles produced at a source propagate in opposite directions .",
    "they are detected by two experimenters , by tradition named alice and bob .",
    "there are two possible ways to test any given bell - type inequality in this situation :    * fix the measurement times and measure for different quasi - spins .",
    "* fix the quasi - spins and measure at different times .",
    "because of the scarcity of directions when it comes to choosing a quasi - spin , the former option does not provide interesting information , other than what would be , much easier , obtained with non - decaying systems like photons .",
    "however , the decay and strangeness oscillation make the latter much more appealing . in short ,",
    "both alice and bob agree upon a single measurement direction , say @xmath79 and each measures his or her particle at a different time .",
    "the measurement procedure in the case of kaons , also requires a certain amount of discussion : while it surely is possible to allow the particles to decay , and then identify the initial particle by it s decay products ( passive measurement ) this does not allow the experimenter a free choice of measurement times .",
    "one possibility ( active measurements ) would be to insert a piece of matter in the way of the kaon beam , and thus , force the particle to decay , by interaction .",
    "the distance between the object and the kaon source would help set the measurement times .",
    "another essential aspect is the ability of the experimenter to choose their measurement angle ( in our case a choice between the particle and its antiparticle ) . a more detailed analysis of the various types of measurements that can be performed on kaons ,",
    "is given in ref .",
    "in this section we describe our generalization of the effective operator formalism .",
    "later , we will see how it can be applied to other systems beyond neutral kaons .",
    "this generalization is based on the bloch equation formalism @xcite .",
    "we start by treating a closed three - level system at zero temperature , with population decay from the upper two levels to a ground level ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "the long and short - lived states @xmath49 and @xmath51 would correspond to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath82 level plays the role of a general `` decayed '' level .",

    "this is a standard method in digital quantum simulations and the approximation can be made arbitrarily good by shorting e.g. the time intervals ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "second , as explained above , there are different decay channels between kaons and the chosen ion examples [ compare eq.([eq:35 ] ) and eq.([eq:36 ] ) ] .",

    "the generalized formalism was applied to neutral kaons , in order to show that it does indeed reproduce previous results , and then applied to the case of two ytterbium isotopes , @xmath0yb and @xmath1yb .",
    "the purpose of the latter is to exemplify a similar type of behaviour , which comes naturally for kaons , on a different , but practically relevant system ; the motivation given by the fact that trapped ions are an important implementation for quantum computation in particular and quantum information processing in general .",
    "the treatment of entanglement in unstable systems can provide a new way of studying the predictions of quantum mechanics in systems other than kaons and ions .",
    "the behaviour treated above can be reproduced with other systems , for example photons travelling through optical fibres . in this case birefringence",
    "determines fast and slow polarization modes , an analogue of the long and short - lived states of neutral kaons , and polarization dependent loss is an analogue to the decay property @xcite .",
    "meson - antimeson systems exhibit one interesting feature that does affect the amount of violation one observes in bell - type inequalities , the phenomenon of cp - violation . because cp - violation translates into an asymmetry between matter and antimatter the eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian",
    "become slightly non - orthogonal ( due to the different probabilities corresponding to the states representing the particle and its antiparticle ) .",
    "such behaviour can also be simulated in the case of trapped ions by an imperfect preparation of the initial bell - state .",
    "another essential feature of the formalism is that it allows for an analytical method to be applied ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) ) , because it reduces the entire time evolution of the system to exponentiating one single operator that encompasses both unitary and non - unitary time evolution .    for future research",

    "the arbitrary rotation in the qubit basis @xmath196 is performed via a polarized rf - field . in this way , any superposition of @xmath82 and @xmath81 can be prepared .",
    "this also assures that a readout is possible in any basis ( corresponding to a rotation from the @xmath197 to the @xmath198 , in the kaon case ) .",
    "the decay is simulated by a second polarized laser @xmath199 driving the transition @xmath200 . from @xmath166 ,",
    "the ion decays very fast into the @xmath201 levels , the probabilities for each of the @xmath202 are equal .",
    "this essentially turns the @xmath203 and @xmath204 sublevels into a generalized decayed state ( the third state in our kaon formalism ) .",
    "there is an inconvenience here , however .",
    "due to the equal probability of a decay from the @xmath4 level back to any of the three @xmath201 sublevels , one also gets dephasing .",
    "we will see in the second example how this problem can be overcome .",
    "the essence of the effective formalism is that it does not distinguish between a non - detection event and one of the two possible states ( decayed or @xmath139 , when measuring @xmath177 , in the kaon case ) .",
    "this could be translated into @xmath205    this provides the option of performing the opposite measurement ( corresponding to @xmath206 above ) . for this , we perform a population inversion between the @xmath201 sublevels and the @xmath195 level . then , a typical fluorescence measurement can be performed on the @xmath6 level .",
    "there is also a second option to perform the population inversion and that is a population shelving from the two sublevels , representing the decayed state , to some other atomic level .",
    "the implementation is done by running a pump laser between the @xmath6 and @xmath4 states , this leads to a population transfer to all four @xmath209 sublevels , due to decay .",
    "then a combination of @xmath183 and @xmath210 polarized lasers move the populations of the upper three @xmath211 sublevels to the @xmath212}$ ] states , and ultimately to the @xmath207 sublevel .    coherent driving of the @xmath213 transition causes a problem , because the level splitting of all @xmath214 states are equal . to isolate this transition ,",
    "an ac stark shift is induced , to increase the distance between the qubit levels and the sublevels @xmath215 and @xmath216 .      finally , we transfer again the state @xmath139 onto @xmath218 before performing a state dependent fluorescence measurement by driving the @xmath219 transition .",
    "this measurement is again an inverse measurement similar to the first example , essentially measuring the probability @xmath220 ( using kaon notation ) ."
