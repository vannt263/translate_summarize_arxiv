    "the and candidates were collected on a single trigger consisting of a two levels : the hardware trigger required electromagnetic energy above threshold ( usually 10 gev ) in a .2 x .2 ( @xmath13 x @xmath14 ) tower .",
    "the software trigger required @xmath15 20 gev and made loose shower shape and isolation cuts .",
    "offline electrons were required to have mostly electromagnetic energy , a shower shape consistent transversely and longitudinally with an electron , be isolated from other activity in the calorimeter , and be matched with a central detector track .",

    "the candidates satisfied @xmath18 25 gev and @xmath19 25 gev , resulting in a sample of 10346 candidates .",
    "the candidates had two electrons with @xmath20 gev , one of which satisfied all the cuts , and the other passed all except the track match cut .",
    "there was an invariant mass cut of @xmath21 gev , creating a sample of 782 candidates .",

    "offline tracks ( `` loose '' muons ) were confirmed by energy in the calorimeter and required to pass through the central iron ( @xmath23 ) and through a minimum magnetic field ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "`` tight '' muons were defined satisfy the loose requirements plus have a matching track in the central detector , have a good quality fit to the vertex point , central detector track and muon track , be in time with beam crossing , and be isolated in the calorimeter .",
