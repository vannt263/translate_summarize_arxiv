    "the electronic mach - zehnder interferometer@xcite ( mzi ) was proposed to study the decoherence @xcite and orbital entanglement effects @xcite by using edge channels in the regime of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "its high interference contrast , observed at temperature of about 20 mk , is the consequence of ballistic transport through the quasi - onedimensional edge channels .",
    "the effect of temperature , @xcite bias voltage , @xcite and the interferometer size @xcite on the interference contrast are currently under intense investigation .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath4 is another important parameter , which controls the structure of the edge state consisting of compressible and incompressible stripes .",
    "@xcite in previous experiments both a monotonic growth of visibility with increasing magnetic field @xcite and a local maximum @xcite were observed within the @xmath0=2 plateau . in these works",
    "only the number of edge channels rather than the precise value of the filling factor @xmath5 was specified . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the electron density , @xmath7 the planck constant and @xmath8 the elementary charge . in this paper , we systematically study the behavior of the mzi visibility in a broad range of filling factors .",
    "we found that the interference for the lowest landau level ( ll ) appears at a filling factor of @xmath0=2.0 , reaches a maximum of visibility of about 50  % at @xmath0=1.5 , and then decays to zero near @xmath0=1.0 .",
    "although the interference occurs only in the outer edge channel , the visibility is strongly affected by the presence of the inner edge channel and its evolution , when @xmath0 is varied between 1 and 2 .",
    "the interferometer ( see fig .  1 ) was fabricated on the basis of a modulation doped gaas / ga@xmath9al@xmath10as heterostructure containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) 90  nm below the surface . at  4  k ,",
    "the unpatterned 2deg density and mobility were @xmath6=2.0@xmath1110@xmath12  m@xmath13 and @xmath14=206  m@xmath15(vs ) , respectively .",
    "photolithography was employed to define hall bars with large contacts ( connected to leads s , d2 and all gates at fig .  1 ) . the ring - shaped interferometer mesa , contact d1 , the quantum point contacts ( with air bridges ) , and the modulation gate ( labeled as mg in fig .",
    "1 ) were patterned by means of electron - beam lithography .",
    "the quantum point contact ( qpc ) no.0 was used to select the outer edge channel for the interference experiment .",
    "we studied two mzis with an arm length of 14 and 9  @xmath14 m and an arm width of @xmath16 m ( @xmath17 m ) , respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the qpcs of the larger mzi had 120  nm gap between sharp tips ( tip radius @xmath1850  nm ) ; for the smaller mzi a 400  nm gap was used .",
    "the area between two interfering paths , determined from the period of the ab oscillations in a magnetic field , was 48 and 25 @xmath19 for these mzis .",
    "a standard lock - in technique ( @xmath20300  hz ) with 1  @xmath14v excitation at terminal s and detection at terminal d2 was employed ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "most of the measurements were performed at a temperature of 25  mk .",
    "( b ) visibility versus magnetic field for both interferometers .",
    "full and open squares correspond to data acquired with at least 4  h waiting time , full circles with 1  h. , width=321 ]",
    "in fig.2 ( inset ) we show a typical trace of current @xmath21 in detector d2 vs  the voltage at the modulation gate @xmath22 . the measured interference contrast is quantified by the visibility which is defined as . when changing magnetic field @xmath4 the qpc transmission has to be readjusted to 1/2 , because it sensitively depends on @xmath4 .",
    "in some cases resonances in the qpc transmission characteristics occurred . in this case the half transmission point with the highest  @xmath23 was selected .",
    "@xcite in order to relate the magnetic field to the filling factor in the mzi arms , the two point conductance of the interferometer between terminal s and d2 with all qpcs opened was measured ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the electron density of the narrowest section of the interferometer can be probed in this way . for the larger interferometer",
    "the transition between the @xmath0=2 and @xmath0=1 hall plateaus is located at @xmath4=5 t and corresponds to the filling factor @xmath0=1.5 . for the smaller interferometer",
    "the transition point shifts to 4.8  t. these reference points were used to determine the filling factor in the range of 3  t@xmath24  t. the visibility of the larger mzi shown in fig.2b with full squares emerges at @xmath254.4 t ( @xmath0@xmath181.7 ) , reaches a maximum of 17% at @xmath0=1.5 , and then non - monotonically decreases to 6% at @xmath4=7.5 t ( @xmath0=1.0 ) . for the smaller interferometer ,",
    "a measurable visibility ( full circles and empty squares at fig.2b ) emerges near @xmath4=3.5 t ( @xmath0@xmath182.0 ) , reaches maximum around b=5 t , and then decreases to zero at about @xmath4=8 t ( @xmath0@xmath180.9 ) .",
    "right after the magnetic field is ramped to the next data point , the visibility drops significantly ( about 50% ) .",
    "however , after some waiting time it recovers and approaches a saturation value .",
    "the saturation takes up to 10  h. as a reasonable compromise between optimum visibility and reasonable data acquisition time we have chosen 1 h ( full circles in fig.2b ) and 4 h ( open squares in fig.2b ) for the waiting time . a measurable visibility was observed in the @xmath0 interval @xmath26 with a maximum in @xmath27 near ( @xmath0=1.5 ) .",

    "current recorded at detector d2 , when qpc1 is closed and qpc2 is opened .",
    "the peak in each curve corresponds to maximum scattering between edges in the lower mzi arm and correspond to @xmath0=1.5 .",
    "inset : data from ( a ) plotted vs filling factor.,width=321 ]    to assure that it is the filling factor which controls the visibility and not the absolute magnetic - field magnitude , we changed the electron density in the interferometer by a back gate .",
    "a decrease in the electron density shifts the entire @xmath27 curve to smaller magnetic fields ( fig.3a , inset in fig.3b ) . as an independent check of the determination of filling factor within the interferometer arm",
    ", we looked at the backscattering properties .",
    "the quantum point contact qpc0 is set to transmit only the outer channel , qpc1 is completely closed , and qpc2 is completely opened . in absence of backscattering within the lower interferometer arm , qpc1 redirects all current from s to the detector d1 , while d2 sees zero signal .",
    "however , when the filling factor is close to 1.5 , backscattering occurs between the counter - propagating lower arm edge channels which appears as signal in d2 ( fig.3b ) .",
    "the maximum of this signal corresponds to the point @xmath0=1.5 where the backscattering is strongest .",
    "we see that a back gate voltage of -28  v shifts the peak , in other words , the point of maximum scattering , from 4.8 to 4.1  t , i.e. , the density decreases by 15  % .",
    "the maximum of visibility was earlier reported to occur on the upper end of the @xmath0=2 plateau , @xcite while we observed it at @xmath0=1.5 .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by an unequal filling factor in the two mzi arms in ref .  .",
    "according to ref .",
    "a mesa width which is not much larger than the depletion length results in different electron densities and therefore different filling factors . to avoid this problem we used the same width for both interferometer arms as well as for the input and output leads .     extracted from the exponential fits according to eq .  [ 1_over_t ] .",
    "the data for the large interferometer ( open circles ) have been multiplied by 2.,width=321 ]",
    "there are three fundamental reasons for a reduction of the visibility : ( i ) genuine decoherence by inelastic scattering ; ( ii ) phase averaging , due to a finite energy window , imposed by temperature and voltage ; @xcite and ( iii ) phase averaging due to fluctuations of charges trapped nearby .",
    "@xcite the last possibility can probably be excluded , since fluctuations in the environment are not expected to strongly depend on @xmath4 .",
    "a recent experimental study of @xmath28 showed that it changes exponentially with @xmath29 :    @xmath30    where the characteristic temperature @xmath31 is inversely proportional to the length of the interferometer arm @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite the electromagnetic environment of the interferometer is expected to give rise to a @xmath35 dependence .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it is again unclear why such an environmental effect should strongly vary with @xmath4 .    as demonstrated by the solid lines in fig .  4",
    ", our data also vary exponentially with @xmath29 above 45  mk . however , at lower temperatures a crossover to a weaker temperature dependence is observed .",
    "the presence of such a crossover is reflected by the extrapolated values of @xmath36 , which significantly exceed the allowed maximum of 100% , and the fact that the fit lines do not cross at @xmath29=0 , but rather at 7  mk .",
    "although it is notoriously hard to exclude that electron heating contributes to the apparent saturation of @xmath37 at @xmath3845  mk ( fig.4 ) , the latter two facts refer to the high - temperature regime and indicate that the behavior of @xmath39 may be more complex than a simple exponential .    despite these differences ,",
    "our data confirm a clear correlation between the extracted values of @xmath40 and the visibility , when the magnetic field is varied . like the visibility",
    ", @xmath40 has a maximum around @xmath3 ( see the inset of fig .  4 ) .",
    "@xcite thus , it is clear that the phase coherence length is magnetic field dependent .",
    "v. ( b ) characteristic energies @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see text ) extracted from @xmath43 together with @xmath44 as a function of magnetic field @xmath4.,width=321 ]    the visibility can also be measured as a function of a dc voltage added to the small ac bias .",
    "this _ differential _ visibility shows a lobe structure @xcite vs  @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "5a we show the evolution of the lobe structure with filling factor",
    ". the observed change of the lobe characteristics resembles the change of visibility with @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , i.e. , the largest distance between the zeros in @xmath37 is found near @xmath0=1.5 and reduces , when @xmath0 moves from = 1.5 to @xmath0=1.0 or 2.0 .",
    "( fig.5b , open squares ) . for @xmath46",
    "more than one pair of side lobes can be observed ( fig.5a , @xmath4=3.9 t ) . the data in fig .",
    "5a can be well approximated by a product of an oscillatory function and a gaussian envelope : @xmath47 which contains the parameters @xmath41 as period of the cosine term and @xmath48 as characteristic width of the envelope .",
    "for a direct comparison , we plot these characteristic energies together with the characteristic temperature @xmath44 extracted from the temperature dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "the energies @xmath41 and @xmath48 agree rather well for @xmath49 , while @xmath48 is slightly smaller than @xmath50 for @xmath51 . on the other hand , @xmath44 is about 15 times smaller . despite the difference in numbers ,",
    "the overall @xmath0  dependence of all energy scales is quite similar .",
    "hence , it appears that the b  dependence of the characteristic energies is closely related to the evolution of the structure of edge states with @xmath0 .",
    "for the following , one has to keep in mind that qpc0 is tuned such that current is injected exclusively into the _ outer _",
    "incompressible strip with @xmath52 .",
    "according to accepted theory , @xcite at small bias the current flows close to the interface between compressible and incompressible stripes . already in ref .",
    "it was realized that the lobe pattern can not be understood in terms of a single electron picture , nor within a simple mean - field approach . nevertheless , the charges injected into the interferometer by the dc  component of the bias appear to induce an overall phase shift , i.e. , they act similar to the modulation gate .",
    "youn et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the average phase shift @xmath53 is determined by the average number @xmath54 of non - equilibrium electrons and the intra  channel coulomb interaction constant @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the traversal time of the electrons through the interferometer and @xmath58 the drift velocity along the edge . using @xmath59 m/s and @xmath60 m ,",
    "one obtains @xmath61 at @xmath62v . with increasing @xmath63 the number of possible charge - density distributions in the interferometer and hence the fluctuations of @xmath64 increases , which according to the numerical calculations in ref",
    ".   leads to a suppression of the visibility at higher @xmath45 . for smaller @xmath55 a larger @xmath45",
    "is needed to reach the first zero of @xmath23 .",
    "if one now assumes that the interaction parameter @xmath55 is affected by the screening properties of the environment of the outer edge channel , the changes of the structure of the 2deg enclosed by the outer edge between @xmath65 and @xmath52 would indeed suggest an nonmonotonic variation of @xmath66 , because the screening is most effective at @xmath3 , where the entire bulk of the 2deg is compressible . on the other hand , at @xmath52 and 2 ,",
    "the bulk of the 2deg is incompressible , implying reduced screening and correspondingly larger values of @xmath55 .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observed nonmonotonic variation of @xmath41 .",
    "the energy scales @xmath41 and @xmath48 must then be related to @xmath67 and @xmath66 .    very recently ,",
    "another theory based on the chiral luttinger liquid approach to the qhe has been suggested .",
    "@xcite in this theory , the excitations are dipolar ( neutral ) and charged edge magnetoplasmon modes with different group velocities @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the model allows to calculate @xmath70 , which is consistent with the observed @xmath29  dependence of @xmath71 .",
    "in addition it predicts for the ratio between @xmath72 . from our data",
    "we deduce a similar experimental value of @xmath73 .",
    "this model requires two well defined edge channels and is valid at @xmath74 .",
    "hence , it remains to be explained , why the experimental data show a visibility maximum for @xmath75 .",
    "another theory for @xmath52 results in a @xmath76 for screened and @xmath77 for unscreened coulomb interactions .",
    "@xcite for the transition between @xmath52 and @xmath65 , so far no theory exists .",
    "qualitatively , one may expect that a fermionic picture is more appropriate here , since the screening by the compressible interior of the interior of the 2deg tends to suppress the luttinger liquid effects .    for a better microscopic understanding of the effect , it is essential to relate the various phenomenological energy scales of the different theories to a realistic model of the structure of the edge channels , i.e. the distribution of compressible and incompressible strips at the mesa edge .",
    "@xcite this distribution considerably changes between @xmath52 and @xmath78 . at @xmath3 and above the outer incompressible strip",
    "is well localized at the mesa edge .",
    "depending on the steepness of the confining potential , it starts to spread out for @xmath79 and fills the whole mesa , once @xmath52 is reached .",
    "the precise reason for the decay of the interference for @xmath51 is still an open question .",
    "the measured temperature dependence of the visibility suggests that @xmath71 is suppressed in this regime again . on the other hand ,",
    "an edge strip that spreads out over 100 nm and more can not be considered as a quasi - one - dimensional object anymore . in particular , it does not enclose a well defined magnetic flux .",
    "the integration of such qhe - specific features into models considering simple one - dimensional conduction channels provides new challenges for the theory .",
    "in summary we investigated the effect of the filling factor on the visibility in a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "surprisingly , the visibility was found to be highest around @xmath0=1.5 and decreases to zero when the adjacent integer filling factors are reached .",
    "this dependence originates from an evolution of the structure of edge channels with magnetic field , which strongly affects three energy scales of the interference in a very similar way : @xmath44 , which determines the temperature dependence of the visibility in the linear regime , and @xmath50 and @xmath80 , which determine the size and damping of the lobe structure of @xmath37 in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this observation suggests that the linear and the nonlinear regimes are governed by the same energy scale .",
