    "1999 as radio emission at 6  cm ) .",
    "it may be possible that all rosat observations of gy  31 took place during low - activity phases .",
    "canonical stellar evolution theory predicts that stars below @xmath491 are fully convective ( drake et al .",
    "1996 ) . hence",
    ", like low - mass late - type stars , brown dwarfs may emit x - rays ; and in cha i , one bona - fide brown dwarf and possibly two brown dwarf candidates are detected x - ray sources ( nc98 ) .",
    "however , convection alone is not enough to generate magnetic fields ( and coronal x - ray emission ) .",
    "some kind of rotation - induced dynamo is needed .",
    "differential rotation could drive dynamo activity ( @xmath41-@xmath492 dynamo ) but convection implies rigid rotation and thus a solar - type dynamo should be quenched in completely convective stars ( drake et al .",
    "however , in the absence of differential rotation , another type of dynamo , related to the coriolis force and driven by turbulent convection , can take over and cause coronal x - ray activity ( @xmath493 dynamo ) .",
    "if x - ray emission in brown dwarfs is driven by a dynamo , then it may be that only the fastest rotating brown dwarfs can be detected given the sensitivity of current instrumentation .",
    "projected rotational velocities @xmath101 are known for two bona - fide brown dwarfs ( see table 4 ) .",
    "they rotate relatively fast , but are not observed deeply with rosat ( nor are they detected ) .    while an old star with a very late spectral type , like eg .",
    "m9 , may in fact display weak coronal ( @xmath91 and x - ray ) activity , eg . due to low rotation",
    ", both young low - mass stars and young brown dwarfs with spectral types of late m or l can be fully convective and may then show x - ray emission . as the brown dwarf ages , fusion of deuterium in its center will stop , so that the temperature in its core will decrease .",
    "consequently , the temperature gradient between center and surface will decrease and , hence , the convection velocity will decrease .",
    "therefore , old brown dwarfs may not be able to show x - ray emission , even if they rotate fast , while old main sequence stars may still be able to produce x - rays .",
    "perhaps , the very low x - ray detection fraction of brown dwarfs is due to variability in the sense that brown dwarfs are no or very faint x - ray emitters for most of the time , but are in an high state for a time that is short compared to the typical exposure .",
    "however , it is unlikely that we would , by chance , detect x - ray emission from several brown dwarfs ( or candidates ) in cha i and taurus , while all pleiades and field brown dwarfs remain undetected .",
    "also , the x - ray detected objects in cha i and taurus do not show significant variability .",
    "the x - ray detected brown dwarfs in cha i may be close binaries with magnetic field configurations like in x - ray bright rs  cvn - type binaries .",
    "however , it would be surprising that @xmath481  _ 1 _  ( as a binary and being the x - ray brightest ) is the faintest object in the optical among the six @xmath91 detected objects in cha i ( crn99 ) ; if the other brown dwarf candidates in cha i were close binaries , too , they should be brighter x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray emission may be linked to accretion or magnetic reconnection between the brown dwarf and a circumstellar disks , but no k - band near - ir excess is seen in the cha i objects ( crn99 ) . however , as far as @xmath481  _ 1 _  is concerned , excess emission is observed at 6.7 and 14.3 @xmath494 by isocam with a color index @xmath495=0.15 $ ] as in normal class ii objects ( comern et al .",
    "1998b ) ; the fact that no excess is detected in the k - band is probably due to a very low accretion rate .",
    "also , in the cases of @xmath1 oph gy  202 as well as tau mho-4 and mho-5 , some near - ir excess does indicate the presence of circumstellar material ( wilking et al .",
    "1999 ; briceo , unpublished ) .",
    "@xmath91 emission , a proxy for chromospheric activity , might be related to x - ray emission .",
    "two of the three x - ray detected objects in cha i show strong @xmath91 emission with @xmath496  ( crn99 ) , and also the four detected objects in taurus show strong @xmath91 emission ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 , briceo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , the brown dwarf @xmath1 oph gy  141 shows similarily strong @xmath91 emission ( luhman et al .",
    "1997 ) , but no x - ray emission .",
    "@xmath91 emission is weak in most of the other bona - fide brown dwarfs ( see table 4 ) .",
    "x - ray emission of brown dwarfs , if typically present even in brown dwarfs as old as the pleiades or older , may be similar to late - type low - mass stars , with @xmath497 .",
    "this can not be rejected from our upper limits .",
    "however , it may be possible that only brown dwarfs younger than @xmath498 myrs emit x - rays . then , in contrast to normal stars , they get fainter and fainter in @xmath35 as they age ( burrows et al . 1995 ) .",
    "hence , their x - ray luminosity should also decrease .",
    "however , because low - mass objects like brown dwarfs probably have only weak or no winds , they have much longer time - scales for angular momentum loss compared to normal stars ( basri & marcy 1995 , martn & zapatero - osorio 1997 ) . hence ,",
    "if x - ray emission of brown dwarfs is due to a rotationally driven dynamo , as in other fully convective low - mass stars , then x - ray luminosities should decrease more slowly in brown dwarfs than in normal stars , so that the non - detection of pleiades brown dwarfs would be surprising .",
    "we conclude that rotation is not the key parameter in x - ray emission of brown dwarfs .",
    "more important may be the fact that the convection velocity of brown dwarfs decreases significantly , because they become fainter as they age .",
    "then , one would also expect @xmath91 emission to be weaker in middle - aged and old brown dwarfs compared to young brown dwarfs .",
    "indeed , strong @xmath91 emission is observed only in young brown dwarfs , but neither in pleiades nor field brown dwarfs . from the x - ray detection of a few @xmath87 myr young brown dwarfs and candidates and the undetection of the @xmath431 myrs old pleiades brown dwarfs",

    "1998 ) assumed that brown dwarfs display the same x - ray luminosity as very late - type stars like vb  8 , ie .",

    "here , we have obtained @xmath500 as typical x - ray emission level for young brown dwarfs .",
