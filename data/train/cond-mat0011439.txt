    "the mott metal - insulator transition is a paradigm for the importance of electron - electron interactions in condensed matter systems .",

    "the underlying mechanism that drives the transition is by now well understood , but details on e.g. transport properties remain largely unknown in @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to the lack of nonperturbative methods for treating strongly correlated electron systems . the situation is more fortunate in two cases : @xmath4 , where much progress has been made in recent years @xcite and @xmath5 , where nonperturbative methods permit essentially a full solution of the problem .",
    "the 1d case is the one we will be concerned with here . a full characterization of the mott insulating phase requires the knowledge of dynamical correlation functions .",
    "the frequency dependent optical conductivity @xmath6 is one of the most important examples from an experimental point of view .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath6 in the metallic regime is easily understood in terms of the tomonaga - luttinger theory @xcite .",
    "the situation in the mott insulating phase is much more complicated due to the spectral gap that is dynamically generated by the electron - electron interactions . here",
    "@xmath6 has until now only been studied by perturbative methods @xcite , which break down in the most interesting regime of frequencies close to the optical gap . in these proceedings we use methods of integrable quantum field theory to determine @xmath6 in 1d mott insulators for all frequencies much smaller than the bandwidth , which is the large scale in the field theory approach to the problem",

    "the paradigm of a 1d mott insulator is the hubbard model @xmath7 here @xmath8 are fermionic annihilation operators of spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 of a one - dimensional chain and @xmath11 .",
    "the 1d hubbard model is solvable by the bethe ansatz @xcite and the exact solution establishes the presence of a mott transition at half - filling ( one electron per site ) and @xmath12 . in other words , for a half - filled band the model is insulating for any nonzero value of the on - site repulsion @xmath13 , whereas it is metallic for a less than half - filled band .",
    "many properties have been determined exactly @xcite , but the asymptotic behaviour of dynamical correlation functions are at present known only in the metallic @xcite and the gas phase @xcite . in order to make progress in the insulating phase and to clearly expose the mechanism underlying the transition it is very useful to consider the scaling limit of the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "this field theory limit corresponds to weak coupling and can be obtained directly from the exact spectrum and scattering matrix of the lattice model @xcite .",

    "computation of higher order terms in ( [ expansion2 ] ) becomes cumbersome and probably of no physical interest , since the previous analysis suggests that they become important outside the region of applicability of the field theory approach to physical systems .",

    "spectral weight is transferred to lower energies and physics beyond that of a pure 1d mott insulator emerges .",
    "there are at least two mechanisms that should be taken into account in this range of energies .",
    "firstly , as mentioned before , a small dimerization occurs in the 1d chains and will almost certainly affect the structure of @xmath6 around its maximum . secondly , the interchain hopping is no longer negligible @xcite and ought to be taken into account .",
