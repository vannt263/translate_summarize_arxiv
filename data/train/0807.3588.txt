    "theoretical modeling of atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets ( egp ) is a young field , about one decade old , and as youngsters usually are , it is very active , restless , and sometimes quite unpredictable .",
    "it had recently undergone a transition from a purely care - free stage ( no observations were available ) to a more difficult stage where there already are some observations to be fit by the theory .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly describe our recent efforts in this area .",
    "we will try to convince the reader that despite its young age and many shortcomings , the theory is actually doing quite well .",
    "the basic aim of a model atmosphere is to predict both the structure ( physical and chemical state ) of an atmosphere as a function of depth , as well as the theoretical emergent spectrum .",
    "the latter is the most important result of a modeling exercise because by comparing the model predictions to actual observations one might constrain the physical conditions in planet atmospheres , and indirectly also of the whole planet .",
    "the general problem of atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets is an extremely complex one that should generally involve a 3-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical treatment of atmospheric motions and day / night side energy redistribution , with departures from chemical equilibrium , and a self - consistent description of clouds ( particle size distribution , cloud position in the atmosphere ) , together with a self - consistent treatment of the radiation field .",
    "such a challenge is still far beyond current computational capabilities , not withstanding the lack of , or inadequacies in , many ingredients needed for the modeling effort , such as complete and reliable atomic and molecular data and optical constants for cloud particles , to name just a few .",
    "obviously , one has to resort to approximations .",
    "it is fair to say that the work of different groups differs mostly by what actual approximation are adopted , and what simplifications are being made . in the absence of exact calculations",
    "it is difficult to decide which approximations are the most restrictive .",
    "therefore , the current and future development of this field will proceed by gradually relaxing more and more approximations , and the observational tests , whenever available , become the judge of whether one is on track .",
    "the current standard model atmospheres of extrasolar planets are based on the following assumptions : ( i ) the atmosphere is assumed to be a plane - parallel , horizontally homogeneous layer ( which reduces the problem to 1-d ) ; ( ii ) the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium ; ( iii ) the atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium ( or radiative+convective equilibrium in convectively unstable layers ) ; ( iv ) local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) holds ( therefore the opacity and emissivity are known functions of only temperature and density , and can , therefore , be pre - tabulated and not computed on the fly during model construction ) ; and ( v ) the atmosphere is in a modified chemical equilibrium ( the local chemical equilibrium which takes into account possible rainout and consequent depletion of species ) .",
    "most groups that produce egp model atmospheres adopt the above assumptions , and use different modeling codes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our group has originally used a code described in @xcite , with an additional algorithm to treat radiation scattering in clouds  @xcite .",
    "we later switched to a more powerful procedure based on adapting the general - purpose stellar atmosphere code tlusty ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , originally designed for non - lte model atmospheres of hot stars , and extended to other stellar types and accretion disks . the specific variant for the atmospheres of egp s and brown dwarfs is called cooltlusty , and has been described briefly in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the code uses the above mentioned five basic assumptions .",
    "the chemical equilibrium and departures from it due to the rainout of the species is treated following @xcite , and the opacity tables are computed as described in @xcite .",
    "soon after the @xcite grid of egp model atmospheres was completed , the very close - in egp , ogle - tr-56b , ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* konacki et al . ( 2003 ) ) ) was discovered , with a planet - star separation of a mere 0.0225 au . we set out to extend our grid to higher irradiations , and found that the computed atmospheric structure depends very sensitively on whether the tio / vo opacity is included in the opacity table or not ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the basic conclusions of that paper are the following : the models without tio / vo always exhibit a monotonic temperature / pressure ( @xmath0 ) profile , with temperature decreasing outward .",
    "when the tio / vo opacity is included , the models remain essentially unchanged for larger planet - star separations , simply because tio and vo are rained out everywhere in the atmosphere , save in the deepest layers which have virtually no effect on emergent spectra .",
    "for very close separations , the model with tio / vo exhibits a significant temperature increase toward the surface . in analogy with the solar - system planets , the region of temperature inversion may be called a  stratosphere . \" but the biggest surprise was that for a certain range of planetary distances , there are actually two legitimate solutions when tio / vo opacity is taken into account ",
    "one with a monotonic decrease of temperature toward surface and one exhibiting a stratosphere !    this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "full lines represent models computed for the opacity table without tio / vo , while the dashed and dot - dashed lines represent models with tio / vo .",
    "the middle model exhibits the true bifurcation  the dashed and dot - dashed lines correspond to the two solutions for the atmospheric structure with exactly the same input parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , elemental composition , and irradiation ) .",
    "the fact that the model without tio / vo is very close to the low - surface - temperature branch of the model with tio / vo clearly indicates that the model bifurcation , and the very existence of the outward temperature increase , arises due to the tio / vo opacity .",
    "the physical explanation of this effect is straightforward ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "tio / vo provide a strong opacity in the optical wavelengths , where the external irradiation ( in the case of solar - type stars ) has its maximum .",
    "therefore , the incoming stellar radiation is efficiently absorbed in the upper atmosphere , thus leading to its heating .",
    "the explanation of bifurcation is analogous .",
    "an atmosphere either `` chooses '' a high surface temperature , in which case tio / vo is present , and the incoming stellar flux is efficiently absorbed ( so one indeed has , consistently , a high surface temperature ) . or , the atmosphere `` choses '' a low surface temperature , in which case tio / vo does not exist near the surface , and , therefore , there is no efficient mechanism to absorb incoming stellar radiation in the upper atmosphere to heat it .",
    "the difference in the temperature structure is reflected in the emergent spectrum . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the emergent flux that coresponds to ogle - tr-56 , with a planet - star separation equal to 0.0225 au . the thick line is a model without tio / vo , and the thin line with tio / vo .",
    "similar results were later obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fortney et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fortney et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "however , there is a potentially serious problem with this picture .",
    "since the presence of tio and vo is quite natural at high-@xmath1/high-@xmath2 points , one confronts a situation in which there are two regions rich in tio / vo , separated by a middle region that is tio / vo free . in a gravitational field with a monotonic pressure profile , this gap could act like a cold trap in which the tio / vo that is transported by molecular or eddy diffusion from the upper low-@xmath2 region into the intermediate cooler region , would condense and settle out , thereby depleting the upper low-@xmath2 tio / vo - rich region .",
    "this would eventually leave no tio / vo at altitude to provide the significant absorption that could lead to a bifurcation .",
    "the situation is much more favorable for very close - in planets , where the temperature is so high that tio / vo is present everywhere in the atmosphere . in this case , one obtains a single solution , that with a stratosphere .",
    "we note that the models presented in @xcite considered no day / night side heat redistribution .",
    "consequently , these models generally tend to overestimate the atmospheric temperature .",
    "we conclude that tio / vo reliably operate only in a limited temperature range ( @xmath3 k ) , because otherwise the cold trap effect may deplete them .",
    "one can speculate , though , that diffusion , turbulent mixing , or a wind may actually replenish tio and vo , but no explicit calculations or even rough estimates have yet been done .",
    "experience from the solar - system giant planets indicates that a number of unknown , optically - active compounds may exist in the upper atmosphere . with extreme irradiation , a complex non - equilibrium photochemistry will very likely take place .",
    "consequently , there may be a number of as yet unknown opacity sources in the upper atmosphere that may build a stratosphere , even in the absence of tio / vo . in view of these uncertainties ,",
    "one is free ( indeed , forced ) to parameterize the extra opacity ; specifically its magnitude ( @xmath4 ) , and its position in the physical and the wavelength space .",
    "therefore , we have adopted such a philosophy .",
    "our approach is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in early studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the degree of the day / night side heat redistribution was described through an empirical parameter , originally denoted as @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "we introduced an analogous parameter , @xmath6 , as a fraction of incoming flux that is redistributed to the night side .",
    "the underlying assumption was that the fraction @xmath6 of the incoming flux is somehow removed before the incoming radiation reached the upper boundary of the atmosphere , and deposited at the lower boundary of the night - side atmosphere .",
    "although this treatment is useful for obtaining a rough estimate of the effects of day / night side heat redistribution , it is unsatisfactory from the physical point of view .",
    "there are two main problems : ( i ) it is unphysical to assume that the incoming flux is removed at the top of the day - side atmosphere and injected in the bottom of the night - side atmosphere , and ( ii ) the calculated entropies in the convection zones at the day and the night side may be generally different . since convective transport is very efficient , the temperature gradient is essentially exactly adiabatic",
    ". consequently , the whole convective core has to he isentropic , and , thus , can not exhibit any difference between the day and night sides .    to overcome these problems ,",
    "we have recently adopted an improved , albeit still parametric , approach ",
    "@xcite . out of the total incoming energy , the fraction @xmath7 is assumed to be radiated on the day side , and the fraction @xmath6 on the night side .",
    "the irradiation energy is removed on the day side in a given depth range , parameterized by limiting pressures @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this energy is deposited on the night side in depth range parameterized by limiting pressures @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are generally different from @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but in actual calculations we usually take them to coincide with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the modeling proceeds as follows : at the day side , the input parameters are @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the surface gravity ) ; @xmath14 ( which corresponds to @xmath15 in the case of stellar atmospheres ) ; @xmath6 ; @xmath8 ; and @xmath9 .",
    "other parameters are the distance and the radius of the parent star , and the elemental composition ( which is assumed to be the same on the night side ) .",
    "the computed model gives the structure ( essentially , the @xmath0 profile and the self - consistent radiation intensity ) , plus the entropy in the convection zone . at the night side ,",
    "the input parameters are : @xmath12 ( which must be the same as at the day side ) ; @xmath6 ; limiting pressures @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; and a trial @xmath16 .",
    "the model again yields a @xmath0 profile , and the entropy at the convection zone , which is generally different from the entropy at the day side .",
    "the intrinsic temperature @xmath16 is adjusted by trial and error so that both entropies ( day and night ) match .",
    "we note that with strong irradiation , the convection zone may be very deep ( at @xmath17 of the order of @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) , and , therefore , the entropy matching is important for evolutionary models , and not so much for predicting emergent spectra .",
    "for close - in egps the planet - star contrast ratios in the mid - infrared are relatively large , often exceeding @xmath20 , and such contrasts are well within reach of the infrared space telescope _",
    "spitzer_. using its irac and mips cameras , and the irs spectrometer , one can now measure the summed light of the planet and the star in and out of the secondary eclipse , and , from the difference , determine the planet s spectrum at superior conjunction ( see several reviews in these proceedings ) .",
    "this has led to a breakthrough in the study of extrasolar planets , for it provides a means to probe the physics , chemistry , and even meteorology of their atmospheres .    before this conference , secondary - eclipse fluxes in the irac and mips",
    "channels had been measured for five transiting planets ",
    "hd189733b , tres-1 , hd 209458b , hd 149026b , and gj 436b .",
    "our group has performed a detailed analysis of four of them ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we have not analyzed gj 436b .    .",
    "we also indicate the position where the monochromatic optical depths for the characteristic wavelengths of the four irac and the mips channel are equal to 2/3 .",
    "( taken from burrows et al .",
    "2007.),width=230 ]    the results are displayed in the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the four transiting planets . for hd 209458b ,",
    "we show three models with an upper - atmosphere extra absorber ( and with resulting stratospheres ) , and one traditional model without an extra absorber .",
    "the values of the redistribution parameter @xmath6 for the models with an extra absorber are 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , and the limiting pressures for the energy sink are 0.01 and 0.1 bars .",
    "the extra absorber , assumed to contribute between 0.4 and 1 @xmath21 m , is placed at altitude below pressures of 25 mbars .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 profiles for the four hd 209458b models depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , together with the  formation depths , \" defined as the position in the atmosphere where the monochromatic optical depth reaches 2/3 , are displayed in fig .",
    "the plot explains why the flux in the irac 2 , 3 , 4 , and mips bands are higher for the model with an extra absorber ( stratosphere ) , while it is lower in the irac 1 band .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that for hd209458b the models with a stratosphere fit the irac 1 , 2 , and 4 points quite well .",
    "however , the irac 3 point near 5.8 @xmath21 m is difficult to fit since the radiation in this band is formed at essentially the same position in the atmosphere as the irac 4 .",
    "analogously , for hd149026b , the model with a stratosphere is clearly preferable .",
    "the situation for hd 189733b is uncertain ; in any case a stratosphere may exist , but there is no compelling case for it . on the other hand ,",
    "the tres-1 data are fitted perfectly with a traditional model without a stratosphere .",
    "since the total irradiated flux is largest for hd 149026b and smallest for tres-1  see @xcite , the presence of the stratosphere seems to be very roughly correlated with the total stellar flux at the planet s surface . in @xcite , we have analyzed also the observed light curves of two non - transiting planets ( @xmath22 and b , and hd179949b ) , and found that for @xmath22 and b the presence of a stratosphere is strongly indicated in order to fit the observed data .",
    "we have found ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that a consistent fit to all data at secondary eclipse for several strongly irradiated transiting planets ( hd 209458b , hd 149026b , and possibly hd 189733b ) , and very likely a non - transiting planet @xmath22 and b , requires that their atmospheres have temperature inversions ",
    "stratospheres  at altitude .",
    "such a thermal inversion affects : ( i ) planet / star contrast ratios at the secondary eclipse ; ( ii ) their wavelength dependences ; and ( iii ) day - night flux contrast during a planetary orbit",
    ". moreover , the presence of the thermal inversion / stratosphere seems to roughly correlate with the total irradiated flux .",
    "temperature inversion is caused either by tio / vo , as first suggested by @xcite , or by another , as yet unidentified , opacity sources .",
    "these may be tholins , polyacetylenes , or various non - equilibrium compounds .",
    "we invoke such extra absorbers , because a cold - trap effect can operate to deplete the upper atmosphere of tio / vo .",
    "however , one may speculate that with ongoing mass loss and/or rotational shear instabilities the atmosphere may be partially replenished in tio / vo .",
    "therefore , while tio / vo might be responsible for the formation of thermal inversions in the strongly irradiated planets , the exact nature of the absorber must be viewed as very uncertain ."
