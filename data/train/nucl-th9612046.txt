    "recently , new information on the @xmath8-propagation in the nucleus has been obtained from a coherent pion decay experiment  @xcite and from a @xmath9 spin - flip transfer experiment  @xcite . in the first experiment the @xmath1c(@xmath4he , t@xmath2)@xmath1c(g.s . )",
    "reaction was used to measure the isovector spin - longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) response function in the @xmath0 resonance region . in the second experiment",
    "the spin observables of the @xmath9 reaction were used to decompose the charge exchange cross section in the @xmath0 resonance region into its spin - longitudinal ( lo ) and spin - transverse ( tr ) components .",
    "similar to the @xmath11-nucleus total cross section data  @xcite the lo cross sections of both reactions show a substantial downward energy shift of the @xmath0 resonance in nuclei , as compared to the proton target . from a consistent @xmath0-hole model analysis of pion and photon scattering , and charge exchange reactions",
    "@xcite it is found that a large part of the observed shift is due to a nuclear medium effect on the lo response function .",
    "the medium effect is caused by the strongly attractive , energy dependent @xmath0-particle - nucleon - hole residual interaction @xmath12 . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath12 can be well described by the @xmath6 model ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the strong attraction of the @xmath11-exchange in the lo channel produces a collective pion mode at excitation energies of @xmath13 mev in the laboratory frame .",
    "the collectivity shifts the lo response function down in energy by 60 mev relative to the spin - transverse ( @xmath14 ) response function .",
    "other , smaller effects come from @xmath0 conversion processes , such as @xmath15  @xcite , and from projectile excitation  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the @xmath0-hole model of refs .",
    "@xcite to the calculation of the damping of the collective pion mode in the nucleus .",
    "the major decay channels are the coherent pion decay , the quasi - free decay , and the 2p emission . while various calculations for the coherent pion decay were published already in refs .",
    "@xcite we give here the results for the quasi - free ( @xmath2p ) decay and the 2p emission .",
    "since the coupling interaction for the quasi - free decay is known we can use this process to study the distortion effects on the outgoing pion and proton wave functions . for the 2p emission process",
    "we assume a @xmath6 interaction .",
    "we show that the 2p emission in the @xmath0 resonance energy region is dominated by the zero - range landau - migdal interaction , the strength of which can be exctracted from the data .",
    "both the pion induced reactions and the charge exchange reactions are well reproduced by calculations with a landau - migdal parameter in the range of @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we describe the @xmath0-hole model used in the analysis of the experimental data . the formalism and the methods of calculation",
    "were presented already in recent papers  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we discuss only those formulas which are connected with the quasi - free decay and the 2p emission .",
    "we start our formulation by writing down the fivefold differential cross section for the charge exchange reaction @xmath17 in the lab frame ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) @xmath20 here @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) denote the target ( excited intermediate nucleus ) and projectile ( ejectile ) , respectively . the @xmath22 system de",

    "the index @xmath39 indicates that in case of the 2p emission the wave functions of the two outgoing identical fermions have to be antisymmetrized .",
    "the wave function @xmath40 describes the intermediate @xmath22 system and is defined by  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the doorway state excited initially by the reaction .",

    "the interaction @xmath75 is the so - called landau - migdal term .",

    "the special value for the landau - migdal parameter @xmath77 ( in units of @xmath78 800 mev @xmath79 ) is known as the ` minimal @xmath80 ' because it cancels out the attractive short range part of the @xmath11-echange potential  @xcite .",

    "the various parameters are fixed as follows : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 gev , @xmath94 gev , @xmath95 gev , and @xmath96 gev .    as a consequence of the pauli principle",
    "the wave functions of the two outgoing protons have to be antisymmetrized .",
    "this leads to two contributions to the 2p emission process , namely the direct and the exchange term ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the antisymmetrization has to be carried out only for the finite - range @xmath11- and @xmath81-exchange potentials .",
    "the landau - migdal term is a zero - range interaction and has not to be antisymmetrized .",
    "this treatment of the @xmath69 interaction is in line with microscopic nuclear structure calculations  @xcite and microscopic g - matrix calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore the landau - migdal parameter @xmath80 extracted from the 2p emission reactions can be directly compared with the values found in these calculations  @xcite .",

    ". therefore the integrated cross sections for ( @xmath97he , t ) induced processes are in a way less exclusive than the pion induced reactions and show only the gross features of the process .",
    "furthermore , our calculations treat the distorsion effects on the incoming and outgoing particles in the adequate frameworks . in the pion induced reaction the distorsion of the incoming pion",
    "is treated within the isobar hole model while the distorsion of the decay pion and protons is described by optical model wave functions  @xcite . in the ( @xmath97he , t ) charge exchange reaction the projectile and ejectile and the decay particles",
    "are described by optical model wave functions , whereas the @xmath0 propagation through the nucleus is again treated within the isobar - hole model .      in fig .",
    "2 we compare the results of our calculations for the @xmath1c(@xmath2,p@xmath2)@xmath3b reaction to the data of ref .",

    "three different calculations are compared to the data .",
    "the dashed curve shows the result of our calculations with @xmath101 while the dot - dashed curve shows the result with @xmath102 . by comparison of both curves",
    "one recognizes that the inclusion of the residual interaction reduces the quasi - free decay cross section by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "this reduction is due to the absorption taking place in the multiple scattering of the pion .",
    "a similar reduction factor is also observed in the total pion - nucleus cross section  @xcite .",

    "we describe the relative motion of the decay particles with respect to the residual nucleus by optical model wave functions .",
    "this is a consistent method within the framework of direct nuclear reaction theory and has been used in the analysis of other reactions , like a(e , e pp ) . for",
    "the calculation of the proton and pion wave functions we used the optical potential parameters , as derived from elastic proton - nucleus  @xcite and elastic pion - nucleus scattering  @xcite . using these optical model wave functions we overestimate the absorption and thus obtain a lower limit for the @xmath1c(@xmath2,p@xmath2)@xmath3b cross section .",
    "a comparison of the solid curve with the data shows that we underestimate the data by @xmath105%  .",
    "this is in agreement with our expectation and assures us that our treatment of the distortion effects is reasonable . in the following calculations we will use the same model for the description of the distortion effects on the outgoing particles .",

    "3 we show the results for the @xmath1c(@xmath2,pp)@xmath5b cross section at @xmath106 = 165 mev . the experiment was performed in coplanar geometry with the angle of proton 1 fixed at @xmath107 .",
    "the threefold differential cross section is plotted versus the angle of proton 2 .",
    "the dashed curve shows the result of our calculation with @xmath101 while the dashed - dotted curve shows the result with @xmath102 .",

    "the solid curve shows the result with additional inclusion of the distortion effect on the outgoing proton wave functions .",
    "this leads to a further reduction of the cross section by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "the calculations shown here were performed with a minimal landau - migdal parameter @xmath109 in the 2p emission matrix element , which gives a very good agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "neglection of the @xmath11- and @xmath81-exchange potentials in the decay interaction leads to almost the same results .",
    "thus the landau - migdal term is the most important ingredient to the @xmath69 interaction .",
    "this is a consequence of the large momentum and energy transfer involved in the @xmath69 decay process leading to a very short ranged interaction .",
    "we remark that the determination of the @xmath80 parameter in the ( @xmath2,pp)-reaction is rather direct since this reaction is dominated by the intermediate @xmath110 excitation . on the other hand , in case of the @xmath1c(@xmath2,pn)@xmath5c reaction  @xcite or photon induced 2p emission reactions  @xcite many competing processes are possible and the landau - migdal parameter @xmath80 can only be extracted in an indirect way .    in fig .",
    "4 we study the same reaction as in fig .  3 ; here the two protons were detected at @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and the cross section is plotted as function of the kinetic energy of proton 1 .",
    "the curves shown have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "note that the data are given in arbitrary units .",
    "thus the data are normalized to the solid curve .",

    "the dependence of the cross section on the kinetic energy of the proton 1 is reproduced well .",
    "the slight deviation of the calculated cross section from the data at low kinetic energies could indicate that the treatment of the distortion on the outgoing nucleons should be improved for these energies .      in fig .  5  ( a ) we compare our results for the @xmath1c(@xmath97he , tp@xmath2 ) reaction with the data of hennino _ et al .",

    "we see no effect of the residual interaction in this energy and angle integrated cross section , i. e. the cross sections with and without inclusion of @xmath12 are the same .",
    "this is an indication that the p@xmath2 events in this reaction come only from the nuclear surface",

    "two calculations are compared to the data : the solid curve shows the result with @xmath102 while the dashed curve shows the result with @xmath101 . in both cases",
    "the distortion effects are taken into account . in order to reproduce the magnitude of the experimental data we used a landau - migdal parameter of @xmath113 .",

    "both values for @xmath80 lie in the range from 0.25  0.35 and are thus in agreement with values of the landau - migdal parameter found in microscopic g - matrix calculations  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented microscopic calculations for the quasi - free decay of the @xmath0 resonance and the 2p emission in nuclei induced by pion absorption and by charge exchange reactions .",
    "these calculations are performed within the framework of the @xmath0-hole model and are consistent with our former calculations of inclusive and exclusive reactions on nuclei . since the coupling interaction for the quasi - free decay",
    "is known we use this process to study the distortion effects on the outgoing pion and proton wave functions . in the 2p emission reactions we describe the @xmath0+n@xmath7 n+n decay interaction by a @xmath70 model , which is consistent with our description of the residual interaction .",
