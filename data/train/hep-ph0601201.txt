    "the idea of construction of sum rules , relating the form - factors of electron with the cross sections of electro - production processes at @xmath0 high energy collisions was born in 1974 . in a series of papers",

    "these cross sections do not decrease as a function of the center of mass total beam energy @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , they are enhanced by a logarithmical factor @xmath3,which is characteristic for weizsacker - williams approximation .",

    "was calculated : @xmath7 the fact that the same coefficients appear in eqs ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) suggests that a relation exists between inelastic cross section and elastic form factors .",
    "this relation was later on derived in the paper @xcite .    here",
    "we review an extension of these studies to strong interaction particles , considering qed interactions in the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "we demonstrate sum rules which relate the nucleon and light nuclei form - factors with the differential cross sections of electron scattering on the corresponding hadrons in peripheral kinematics .",
    "this kinematics corresponds to the region of very small values of bjorken parameter @xmath8 in deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
