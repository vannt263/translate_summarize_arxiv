    "topological states of matter are usually characterized as fully gapped insulating or superconducting states in the bulk with gapless excitations on the surface .",
    "recently it has been recognized that gapless systems can also possess nontrivial momentum space topology and protected surface states  @xcite .",
    "being gapless in the bulk , these states fall outside the classification scheme of the gapped topological insulating and superconducting states  @xcite . some interesting examples of such gapless systems in three dimensions are semimetallic phases , where two non - degenerate energy bands touch either at isolated point nodes or weyl points  @xcite , or along a line node  @xcite .",
    "these systems constitute intriguing examples of fermionic quantum critical systems  @xcite ( power law behaviors of thermodynamic quantities ) with nontrivial momentum space topology .",
    "the quasiparticles possess linear dispersion in the vicinity of the weyl points , and in particular the weyl points act as the monopoles and anti - monopoles of unit strength of the berry curvature , and the topological invariant for these systems is determined by the strength of the ( anti)monopoles ( @xmath7 ) , which also determines the chirality or the handedness of the quasiparticles . in the presence of translational invariance , weyl fermions are topologically protected , in the sense that they can only be eliminated when a pair of such point nodes with opposite handedness ( chirality ) merge in momentum space due to the tuning of some external parameter @xcite .",
    "a number of systems have been recently shown  @xcite to support massless weyl fermions ( in either semi - metal or superconducting phases ) as the bulk low energy excitations , and the associated topologically protected zero - energy surface states in the form of open fermi / majorana arcs .",
    "there are also interesting proposals for systems which can exhibit line nodes in the bulk and dispersionless zero - energy bound states on the surface  @xcite .    however , these gapless systems are yet to be experimentally realized , the only exception being the weyl fermions around the fermi surface poles in the @xmath5-phase of @xmath8he  [ ] .",
    "therefore , it behooves us to identify promising experimental systems for realizing gapless topological states of matter . in this direction ,",
    "gapless superconducting systems are expected to play an important role .",
    "in particular the charge conjugation symmetry of superconductor guarantees that the chemical potential of the nodal excitations is exactly tuned at the band touching points or lines . in a recent paper  [ ] , one of us has argued that the uranium based unconventional superconductors with both line and point nodes can serve as multi - functional systems .",
    "motivated by this , we critically examine the nodal topology of the superconducting @xmath0 phase of the heavy - fermion compound upt@xmath1 .",
    "our main findings are summarized below :    1 .",
    "we show that the superconducting @xmath0 phase of the heavy - fermion compound upt@xmath1 provides a spectacular example of triplet , chiral @xmath9-wave pairing , which supports a line node in the basal @xmath10 plane and double berry ( anti)monopoles at the intersection of the closed fermi surfaces with the @xmath4-axis .",
    "we demonstrate that the line node acts as a vortex loop in the momentum space , while the double berry monopole ( of strength @xmath11 ) generalizes the notion of the weyl fermions ( unit monopoles ) to double majorana ",
    "weyl fermions .",
    "the line node is expected to give rise to dispersionless , zero - energy surface andreev bound states ( sabs ) on the @xmath12 surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the double monopoles give rise to two protected fermi arcs on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 surfaces , which are bounded by the images of the monopole and the antimonopole on the surface brillouin zone .",
    "_ in the absence of disorder , the ballistic double majorana ",
    "weyl fermions give rise to a large anomalous thermal hall conductivity @xmath15 , which is measurable with conventional experimental set up_. we also predict a topological phase transition between the @xmath5 and the @xmath0 phase .",
    "finally , we consider the effects of weak disorder on the nodal quasiparticles .",
    "both types of nodal quasiparticles possess linearly vanishing density of states @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , weak disorder acts as a marginally relevant perturbation that gives rise to a finite density of states at zero energy . in this process",
    ", weak disorder vanquishes the ballistic quasiparticle poles . _ therefore , the line node and the double - weyl point nodes become unstable against an infinitesimal amount of disorder , which converts the topological semimetallic phase of the bcs quasiparticles into a diffusive phase_. immediately below the transition temperature , the specific hxeat varies as @xmath17 ( due to the linear density of states associated with ballistic excitations ) and eventually crosses over to @xmath18 ( characteristic of a diffusive phase ) . due to the broken time reversal symmetry",
    ", the diffusive phase still supports anomalous thermal hall effect .",
    "we argue that the value of @xmath19 in this diffusive metal is comparable to that in the ballistic double majorana ",
    "weyl regime , for smooth disorder that does not cause appreciable backscattering between two nodes of opposite chirality .",
    "by contrast , the diffusive phase emerging from of a time - reversal invariant @xmath5-phase with line nodes does not support anomalous thermal hall effect , even though it shows the crossover behavior for the specific heat similar to the @xmath0-phase .",

    "the power - law temperature dependence of the ultrasonic attenuation  @xcite , the nmr relaxation rate ( @xmath21 )  @xcite , magnetic field penetration depth  @xcite and thermal conductivity  @xcite suggest the existence of nodal excitations with density of states ( dos ) @xmath16 . the linear in energy dos is also supported by the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "it has been realized early on that the superconducting order parameter satisfying this requirement must belong to either the pseudospin - singlet @xmath23  @xcite or the pseudospin - triplet @xmath24  @xcite irreducible representation of the hexagonal @xmath25 point group .",
    "early attempts to unambiguously discriminate between these two possibilities based on existing measurements proved inconclusive  @xcite .",

    "recently , this conjecture has received strong support from the phase - sensitive josephson interferometry  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 pseudospin - triplet order parameter is characterized by two basis functions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 multiplying the @xmath28-vector @xmath29 .",

    "the choice of the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the above expression for @xmath35 is determined by energetic considerations , and in zero external magnetic field , two different phases are realized : the @xmath5-phase with @xmath36 is stable at high temperatures ( @xmath37  mk ) and the low - temperature @xmath0-phase with @xmath38 is realized at @xmath39  mk .",
    "the latter choice results in the pairing wavefunction @xmath40 which is time reversal symmetry breaking , chiral pairing and has u(1 ) axial symmetry .",

    "we find that @xmath41 , i.e. the @xmath5-phase has zero net orbital momentum , @xmath42 .",

    "both the @xmath5 and @xmath0 phase possess gapless line nodes at the equator @xmath46 , consistent with nmr and thermal conductivity data  @xcite .",

    "experimentally , trs in @xmath0 phase was first indicated  @xcite by the muon spin resonance ( @xmath50sr ) measurements@xcite .",
    "very recently , the same conclusion was reached by the observation of a field - trainable polar kerr effect , which is only present in the @xmath0 phase but disappears in the @xmath5 phase  @xcite .",
    "it has also been confirmed that the polar kerr effect is not related to the presence of a small antiferromagnetic moment in the basal @xmath10 plane .",
    "together , josephson interferometry and the polar kerr effect measurements provide compelling evidence in favor of the chiral @xmath24 state  @xcite .",

    "<S> the recent phase sensitive measurements in the superconducting @xmath0-phase of upt@xmath1 provide strong evidence for the triplet , chiral @xmath2 pairing symmetries , which endow the cooper pairs with orbital angular momentum projections @xmath3 along the @xmath4-axis . in the absence of disorder </S>",
    "<S> such pairing can support both line and point nodes , and both types of nodal quasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> the point nodes , located at the intersections of the closed fermi surfaces with the @xmath4-axis , act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the berry curvature , and generalize the notion of weyl quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the @xmath0 phase should support an anomalous thermal hall effect , the polar kerr effect , in addition to the protected fermi arcs on the ( 1,0,0 ) and the ( 0,1,0 ) surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the line node at the fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in the momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy , dispersionless andreev bound states on the ( 0,0,1 ) surface . at the transition from the @xmath0-phase to the @xmath5-phase , the time reversal symmetry is restored , and only the line node survives inside the @xmath5-phase . as both line and double - weyl point nodes possess linearly vanishing density of states , we show that weak disorder acts as a marginally relevant perturbation . consequently , an infinitesimal amount of disorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole , while giving rise to a diffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting diffusive phase exhibits @xmath6-linear specific heat , and an anomalous thermal hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the low temperature thermodynamic and transport properties display a crossover between a ballistic thermal hall semimetal and a diffusive thermal hall metal . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the diffusive phase obtained from a time - reversal invariant pairing exhibits only the @xmath6 linear specific heat without any anomalous thermal hall effect . </S>"
