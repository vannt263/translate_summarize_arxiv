    "this talk will discuss the experimental evidence for and against pentaquarks , in particular the `` exotic '' baryonic states that have charge and flavor quantum numbers that require a minimal valence quark configuration of four quarks and one anti - quark .",
    "the recent work in this field began with the first report  @xcite , at the 2002 panic conference , of a narrow @xmath1 at 1540 mev decaying to @xmath2 .",
    "there are older chapters in the search for positive strangeness `` @xmath3 '' resonances  @xcite and of charmed strange pentaquarks  @xcite that we will omit here . in the three years since the announcement of a positive strangeness baryon , named the `` @xmath4 '' , an enormous amount of work has been done , seemingly by every particle physics collaboration in the world , to seek evidence for narrow pentaquark states .",
    "this led to the sightings for states identified as the @xmath4 , the @xmath5 , the @xmath6 , and the @xmath7 .",
    "after an initial flurry of positive reports for these states , null results , that is , searches that led to no observed narrow exotic structures , started to dominate the field . as i will try to show below , from the perspective of the 2005 panic conference , there was a certain sociological `` bandwagon effect '' in 2003 and the first half of 2004 in which numerous groups rushed be part of the wave of positive sightings .",
    "the bandwagon lost momentum when measurements repeated with higher statistics gave negative results , and when numerous negative searches emerged in previously unexplored channels . while over 50 experimental papers discussing pentaquark searches can now be found in the literature , over the same time period there have been over 550 theoretical papers .",
    "thus , the impact of pentaquark searches has been to renew interest in models of qcd which try to address the fundamental question of why nature prefers only the conventional 3-quark baryonic states and not more complex configurations such as pentaquarks .",
    "what are pentaquarks ?",
    "qcd does not explicitly forbid baryons with four quarks and an antiquark , or mesonic - like states two quarks and two anti - quarks .",
    "this was discussed in the context of bag models , for example , by jaffe  @xcite and deswart _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in soliton models",
    "there were early discussions by , among others , kopeliovich  @xcite , chemtob  @xcite , and walliser  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent interest in pentaquarks stems from bold predictions made by diakonov , petrov and polyakov  @xcite in the context of a chiral - quark soliton model for an anti - decuplet of pentaquark states .",
    "they predicted a narrow @xmath8 mev ) @xmath9 state , the @xmath4 , close to @xmath10 mev .",
    "the same model predicted seven non - exotic pentaquark baryons which could behave like ordinary @xmath11 states or hyperons .",
    "the model also predicted a set of cascade - like ( @xmath12 ) states near 2070 mev , two of which , the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 had the charge - flavor  exotic structures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . in this model ,",
    "the pentaquarks emerge as rotational excitations of the soliton , with @xmath17 .",
    "the initial experimental reports of states corresponding , perhaps , to this specific anti - decuplet prediction led to extensive theoretical re - evaluation of qcd models to shed additional light on pentaquark physics .",
    "for example , in a quark - model approach jaffe and wilczek  @xcite explored the possibility of di - quark attraction strong enough to cause new stable hadronic structures . in that model",
    ", the pentaquarks consist of two bosonic @xmath18 diquark pairs coupled via @xmath19 to an anti - quark , with the lowest states having @xmath17 .",
    "an octet of di - quark pentaquarks was predicted to accompany the anti - decuplet , and it was suggested that charm and bottom analogs to the @xmath4 might also be stable against strong decay .",
    "the lattice community tried to find evidence for pentaquark structures , and results from a total of 10 groups have appeared  @xcite . in all those studies ,",
    "the crucial point was to distinguish a simple @xmath20 continuum scattering state from a `` bound '' @xmath4 pentaquark structure .",
    "the results were conflicting , with equal numbers of results reporting a pentaquark structure as not , and with disagreement among the affirmative results regarding the spin and parity of the ground state .",
    "a way of summarizing the various categories of pentaquark searches since october 2002 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] . the table groups experiments by reaction type , and",
    "uses green ( horizontal bars ) or red ( vertical bars ) circles to show the experiments in each category that found positive or negative evidence , respectively , for pentaquarks . for example , in the first row are the experiments done with few - gev real photons on deuterium or carbon .",
    "four positive @xmath4 pentaquark sightings are entered , but then a recent negative result completes the row . the negative result in this reaction category was a high - statistics repetition ( from clas at jefferson lab ( clas - d2 )  @xcite ) of one of the previous positive sightings ( also from clas at jefferson lab ( clas - d1 )  @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the table is meant to suggest that pentaquarks in this category of reaction have likely been ruled out . as another example",
    ", the one positive @xmath13 measurement from na-49/cern  @xcite is followed , on two rows of the table , by at least 10 negative results from either hadronic or electromagnetically induced reactions .    the intent of the table in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] is also to show how a kind of `` bandwagon '' effect took place starting in late 2002 , with a succession of positive pentaquark sightings from diverse collaborations . by the middle of 2004 a total of 14 positive sightings",
    "were reported .",
    "there was concern about the consistency of these reports , especially the somewhat discrepant reported mass values , and the generally poorly - understood backgrounds in the reported mass spectra .",
    "the rush of positive sighting then stopped , and from the middle of 2004 until late 2005 most of the reports were negative .",
    "as seen in the table , in many cases one can say that a given negative result essentially repudiates a specific previous positive sighting .",
    "few experiments have been repeated under exactly identical experimental conditions , so there is room for continued debate in some cases .",
    "the remaining unchallenged positive findings ( rows not ending in a red ( vertical bars ) marker ) are becoming harder to reconcile .",
    "this table is not exhaustively complete .",
    "for example , more experiments than are shown reported _ not _ seeing a @xmath7 state , though rigorous upper limits were seldom given . also , we omit the phenomenological studies that reanalyzed existing @xmath20 phase shift and scattering data to infer a maximum allowable width for the @xmath4 .",
    "these led to estimates of @xmath21 mev for the allowable total width of the @xmath4  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .    in the category of real gev photons on nuclei ,",
    "the initial report from leps / spring-8  @xcite used a carbon ( scintillator ) target ; a subtle fermi - motion correction was needed since only a @xmath22 and @xmath23 were detected in the reaction @xmath24 . a follow - up experiment from leps / spring-8 on deuterium  @xcite",
    "was performed under the same conditions as the carbon experiment .",
    "more evidence for the @xmath4 formation was shown at conferences , but that result is unpublished .",
    "the leps collaboration also reported a weak positive signal , from the same data set , in the exclusive channel @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the identified @xmath26 tagged the strangeness of the @xmath4 , but the signal sat on a large and steeply - sloped background .",
    "stronger positive evidence for a @xmath4 was reported by clas / jlab  @xcite in an exclusive measurement on deuterium , @xmath27 .",
    "a 4.6 to 5.8 @xmath28 signal was seen above a large background that was difficult to estimate quantitatively due to nuclear final state interaction effects .",
    "both leps and clas suffered from unknown or poorly - known background distributions under their resolution- and statistics - limited signal peaks .",
    "clas at jefferson lab repeated the measurement on deuterium in early 2004 , and reported results in mid-2005  @xcite . with six times the statistics , no @xmath4 peak was seen in the @xmath29 reaction , and a model - dependent upper limit of 4 to 5 nanobarns was set for a state at 1.54 gev .",
    "the previous clas result , when fitted with a luminosity - scaled background shape from the higher statistics run , was reduced in significance to about @xmath30 .",
    "clas also did not see a signal in the @xmath31 final state , albeit the kinematic conditions were not the same as those at leps . on balance",
    ", there is no good strong experimental evidence left to suppose the existence of a @xmath4 produced in these channels .    in exclusive production by gev - scale real photons on the proton",
    ", excitement was generated by the saphir collaboration at bonn  @xcite when they reported a 300 nanobarn positive signal in the reaction @xmath32 .",
    "the strangeness of the decaying @xmath33 was indeterminate , but the narrowness of the signal , @xmath34 mev , was believed to signal formation of the pentaquark .",
    "this same reaction was tested with much higher statistics at the same kinematics by the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "no @xmath4 signal was found , and an integrated upper limit of 0.8 nb was set at 1.54 gev , with similar results over a wide range of mass values and production angles .",
    "a second channel of exclusive production on the proton was reported by clas  @xcite , in @xmath35 .",
    "the neutron was detected by missing mass , the pion was constrained to go into the forward hemisphere in the center of mass , and the @xmath22 from the putative pentaquark decay was constrained to be in the backward hemisphere .",
    "this combination of cuts was thought to enhance diffractive production of a high mass non - strange nucleon resonance which could then decay to a @xmath23 and a @xmath4 .",
    "a @xmath36 signal was reported .",
    "so far , this measurement has not been repeated at any other lab .",
    "it is perhaps the most convincing remaining candidate as of the beginning of 2006 .",
    "the ideal way to make a @xmath4 pentaquark that has a mass near 1.54 gev is to scatter @xmath22 particles of about 430 mev / c momentum from neutrons .",
    "review of the low energy kaon scattering phase shifts revealed no signatures , but left open the possibility of excitation of a small , less than 1 mev wide state  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the diana collaboration at itep used a slowing 850 mev / c @xmath22 beam in a xenon bubble chamber to report a narrow signal at 1.54 gev  @xcite .",
    "the detected final state of @xmath37 had no well - defined strangeness , but the initial @xmath22 did define the strangeness . in recent years",
    "there have been no high intensity low momentum kaon beams in the world to repeat this kind of measurement . to evade this problem , the belle collaboration at kekb , searched for hadronic events stemming from identified @xmath22 s , produced in @xmath38 collisions , that interacted in detector elements near the collision point  @xcite .",
    "their sensitivity was slightly better than that of the diana experiment , but they did not confirm the previous measurement . an upper limit given in terms of the width of the state was reported , @xmath39 mev .",
    "a second nearly ideal way to make a @xmath4 pentaquark is in the reaction @xmath40 , where the pentaquark decays to @xmath37 .",
    "this avenue was followed by the tof collaboration at cosy / jlich which reported  @xcite a 4 to 6 @xmath28 signal in this channel using a non - magnetic time of flight spectrometer . unfortunately , their experimental background under the signal , like in many of the other positive sightings , was not calculable , and so had to be fitted with a polynomial .",
    "this leads to concern about the reliability of the signal - to - background estimation .",
    "also , there was no hint of the @xmath4 band in a @xmath41 dalitz plot analysis .",
    "this measurement has not been repeated yet at cosy or any other laboratory , so it stands , at the present time , as a surviving candidate .    at much higher energies",
    ", one can consider pentaquark production in the fragmentation of quark systems from various targets .",
    "the hermes collaboration at hera reported  @xcite a @xmath4 signal from quasi - real photons ( @xmath42 ) produced in positron scattering at 27 gev on deuterium .",
    "it was a statistically weak signal , relying on background estimation from a standard monte carlo fragmentation model , but also invoking the presence of a number of poorly - characterized excited hyperon resonances , in addition to the putative @xmath4 . at the other end of the @xmath43 continuum ,",
    "a @xmath4 signal was reported by the zeus collaboration  @xcite at hera from @xmath44 collisions near a c.m .",
    "energy of 310 gev .",
    "a narrow bump appeared at 1.52 gev above a quark fragmentation monte carlo background estimation , but only for @xmath45 ( gev / c)@xmath46 .",
    "the signal was visible in both the @xmath37 and the @xmath47 combinations , which , while neither tags the strangeness of the signal uniquely , does hint at the formation of both @xmath4 and @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , the signal resides very near the steeply - sloped phase - space background for the detected final state , such that the significance of the signal hinges crucially on the reliability of the background monte carlo model .",
    "furthermore , a second bump near the putative @xmath4 was seen , and this was ascribed to a poorly - known @xmath49 hyperon resonance , and such hyperon bumps are otherwise unseen in high energy experiments .",
    "these two experiments in high energy lepton scattering can be contrasted with the much higher statistics measurements from the babar collaboration at slac  @xcite . in that measurement ,",
    "beam halo electrons and positrons scattered from the beam pipe surrounding the interaction region , resulting in nuclear scattering of the leptons from beryllium .",
    "such events are dominated by the lowest @xmath43 s , and thus are comparable to the kinematics of the hermes measurement . there was no hint of a @xmath4 in the babar @xmath37 spectrum , contradicting the previous experiment .",
    "the comparison of babar to zeus is less significant since the latter result was for @xmath50 ( gev / c)@xmath46 ; indeed , zeus saw no signal at lower @xmath43 .",
    "we also note that babar did not see a signal for the @xmath4 or any of the other pentaquark states in @xmath38 collisions not related to `` beam pipe '' scattering , and set upper limits about an order or magnitude below the production of ordinary baryons near the candidate mass values  @xcite .",
    "mining old data for new phenomena , five neutrino bubble chamber experiments from cern and fermilab were combined to report a narrow peak of a few dozen @xmath37 events at 1.53 gev  @xcite .",
    "there was a clear excess of events above the mixed - event background , not only at the location of the putative pentaquark but also at higher masses .",
    "thus , it is possible that the estimated background was not understood well enough to reliably claim the presence of a specific new signal at 1.53 gev .    in scattering hadronic probes at high energy from nuclear target , a positive signal for the @xmath4 decaying to @xmath37",
    "was reported by the svd collaboration , using 70 gev protons in a fixed - target arrangement at a c.m .",
    "energy of about 11.5 gev .",
    "their initial report  @xcite was supported by a more recent  @xcite detailed analysis which increased their pentaquark signal by a factor of about 8 .",
    "the signal in the @xmath37 mass spectrum comprises about 300 events per channel , with a substantial background under the peak that was modeled using mixed events and standard monte carlo .",
    "the statistics of this measurement must be contrasted to the results of wa-89 collaboration for the scattering of a 340 gev / c @xmath51 beam from carbon and copper  @xcite . at these high energies",
    "it is hard to imagine that the beam energy , probe , or target material could make much difference to the production of pentaquarks .",
    "thus , the featureless 40,000 counts per channel in the wa-89 spectrum strongly suggests that hadronic production of the @xmath4 has not occurred .",
    "the sphinx collaboration at ihep had also looked using 70 gev protons on carbon for a @xmath4 signal with a null result  @xcite .",
    "they were able to reconstruct decay channel @xmath37 , but also had results for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "their upper limits were in the range of 30 nb / nucleon , and a production ratio of @xmath54 to @xmath55 of less than 0.02 .",
    "a further negative result for 800 gev protons on a carbon target was reported by hypercp at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "their upper limit was given as less than @xmath56 @xmath4 production of all reconstructed @xmath57 events .",
    "finally , a negative result was reported by hera - b  @xcite for the interaction at 41.6 gev c.m .",
    "energy of protons on several nuclear targets .",
    "they set modest upper limits for @xmath4 production of less than 16 @xmath58b / n and less than about @xmath59 relative to the @xmath26 .",
    "thus , despite the recent positive result reported by svd-2 , the evidence is greatly against the production of @xmath4 pentaquarks in high energy hadronic production .",
    "further non - observations of the @xmath4 were reported for @xmath60 decays involving @xmath61 from bes  @xcite , for @xmath62 collisions from cdf  @xcite , and from events in @xmath38 collisions at the @xmath3 pole from aleph  @xcite .",
    "the significance of these results in relation to the positive observations at low energies is difficult to estimate , since the production mechanism of exotic pentaquarks is , well , exotic .",
    "nevertheless , these results add some weight to the conclusion that these states have in fact not been seen .    in the theoretical models mentioned earlier  @xcite @xcite , the other exotic pentaquarks that were predicted were two cascade - like ( @xmath12 ) states in the mass range of 1.75 to 2.07 gev .",
    "the na-49 collaboration at cern found evidence  @xcite for narrow states at 1.86 gev in @xmath63 collisions at 17 gev c.m .",
    "energy , detected via decays such as @xmath64 .",
    "( note that the particle data group calls this state the @xmath65 . )",
    "the close agreement of the predictions with this experimental result was very exciting , especially in view of the previous seemingly accurate predictions of the mass of the @xmath4 .",
    "however , a deluge of contrary experimental results followed this one positive claim for a cascade pentaquark .",
    "at least ten results have been released which repudiate the existence of the states seen by na-49 : from wa-89  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , hera - b  @xcite , aleph  @xcite , hermes  @xcite , focus  @xcite , babar  @xcite , zeus  @xcite , compass  @xcite , and e690/fermilab  @xcite .",
    "in general , the negative reports have much higher statistics than the original positive report , and came from @xmath63 , @xmath44 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 experiments .",
    "upper limits relative to production of the well - known @xmath68 state were typically an order of magnitude below the na-49 observation .",
    "thus , there is really no chance left that these exotic pentaquarks candidates exist at measurable production levels .",
    "the h1 collaboration at hera reported evidence  @xcite in @xmath44 collisions for a narrow anti - charmed baryon dubbed the @xmath6 , which would have a minimal quark configuration of @xmath69 .",
    "the state had a mass of 3.099 gev , was as narrow as the experimental resolution , and detected via the decays @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it was reported to contribute about @xmath72 of the @xmath73 production rate in dis . as in many of the other pentaquark searches , the signal comprised two or three `` high '' channels above a very substantial background .",
    "a 5.4@xmath28 significance was claimed for the high - count region .",
    "much higher statistics negative results were subsequently reported in the same final states by zeus  @xcite , focus  @xcite , and aleph  @xcite .",
    "no other positive sightings have come out .",
    "if the @xmath74 pentaquark were an isovector object , not the isoscalar predicted in most models , then other charge states exist , such as a @xmath7 .",
    "the decay of this state to @xmath75 is especially easy to look for . whereas many non - sightings have been mentioned in the pentaquark literature , a recent result from the star collaboration at rhic claims  @xcite a narrow state decaying to @xmath75 in deuteron - gold collisions at 200 gev @xmath76 c.m .",
    "energy , with a 4.2@xmath28 significance .",
    "the state sits atop a very large but smooth mix - event background , but unfortunately also sits next to an equally large bump that is attributed to @xmath77 particle identification errors .",
    "confirmation of this structure and its interpretation are clearly needed .",
    "in summary , after three years of intense activity , pentaquarks have come and gone . in this paper / talk we have not had time or space to dwell on many specifics of any of the experiments , but the overall trends are very consistent . most of the positive sightings have been contradicted or placed in doubt by better measurements .",
    "the remaining candidates have no common thread to unify their phenomenology .",
    "most important , no single truly convincing positive measurement claim has appeared .",
    "recent new candidates suffer ( again ) from low statistics and poorly - understood backgrounds . as was shown in this paper",
    ", there was a rush of positive sightings between late 2002 and mid-2004 . from that time forward almost all experiments showed null results for detection of @xmath74 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 pentaquarks .",
    "thus , one can conclude that a `` bandwagon '' rush of over - optimistic positive sightings was in effect initially , but now the lack of convincing evidence for narrow exotic pentaquarks is overwhelming .",
