    "critical properties of systems described by several complex fields coupled to the gauge field have a long history of studies and are relevant for numerous problems in physics which include normal - superfluid transitions in multi - component neutral or charged liquids ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , superfluid  valence - bond solid ( sf - vbs ) transitions in lattice models @xcite , the higgs mechanism in particle physics @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite argued that the sf  vbs transition in a @xmath2-dimensional system is an example of a qualitatively new type of quantum criticality ( `` decondined criticality '' ) that does not fit the ginzburg - landau - wilson ( glw ) paradigm . as suggested in reference @xcite , an experimental realization of the sf - vbs transition is possible in the system of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattice .",
    "if true , the significance of the claim that dcp opens a new era in the theory of phase transitions is hard to overestimate .",
    "the study of the sf - vbs transition within the dcp theory framework , and the closely related problem of the runaway flow to strong coupling in the theory of scalar quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite is the main focus of this work .",
    "we also discuss a short - range analog of the dcp action , namely , the model describing lattice phases of the two - component bose - hubbard ( bh2 ) system with large integer filling factors @xcite .",
    "the only difference between the dcp and bh2 models lies in the interaction range .",
    "the dcp action is characterized by a long - range coulomb type interaction , which is replaced with the contact @xmath3-functional form in the bh2 analog . despite this difference ,",
    "the gross features of the phase diagram are surprisingly similar in both models , especially in the regimes of intermediate and strong coupling between the two field components .",
    "even quantitatively , the phase diagrams are nearly indistinguishable , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "both feature a bicritical point ( bp ) above which there are three phases : a superfluid ( sf ) , a paired phase and an insulator .",
    "the superfluid is characterized by the order parameters for two complex scalar fields , @xmath4 . in the paired phase",
    "the order parameter is @xmath5 while @xmath6 . in the context of the dcp theory ,",
    "the paired phase is associated with the valence - bond supersolid ( sfs ) ; within the bh2 model @xcite it corresponds to the super - counter - fluid ( scf ) phase describing pairing between particles of one component and holes of another @xcite .",
    "finally , the insulating phase represents the vbs state in the dcp theory and the mott insulator ( mi ) state in the bh2 model . in this phase",
    "all off - diagonal order parameters are zero .",
    "the crucial difference between the two models is seen _ below _ the bicritical point bp , where direct transitions from insulator to sf take place . in the dcp action",
    "this line describes the sf - vbs transformation .",
    "an implicit assumption made in refs .",
    "@xcite was that as the interaction constant between the field components , @xmath7 , weakens down to @xmath8 ( where dcp and bh2 actions become identical and describe two decoupled xy - models ) , there exists a lower tricritical point ( tp ) @xmath9 below which the vbs - sf transition becomes continuous . since lower",
    "tp does exist in the short - range bh2 model @xcite , the expectation was that both models have essentially identical phase diagrams , with only one important difference in the short - range case the continuous transition below lower tp accounts for the u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) universality , while the continuous transition in the dcp action for @xmath10 would be in the new  deconfined \" universality class .",
    "however , as we suggested earlier @xcite and now clearly demonstrate below , no such lower tp exists in the dcp action and the line of i - order sf - vbs transitions extends all the way to @xmath11 .",
    "the tool we introduce for studying subtle features of the phase diagram is the numerical flowgram method .",
    "it is based on scaling properties of quantities similar to binder cummulants @xcite and turns out to be much more adequate for analyzing weakly i - order transitions than the conventional method based on the bimodal shape of the energy / action distribution and hysteresis loops .",
    "the flowgram technique can also be used for systematic identification of polycritical points . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no other method can achieve this goal with comparable accuracy .",
    "first , we construct the flowgram for the bh2 model and demonstrate its efficiency for those parts of the phase diagram which can be reliably identified by more conventional methods .",
    "next , we apply the new method to the most controversial region of the bh2 phase diagram between bp and upper tp , which we failed to resolve in the previous study @xcite .",
    "the existence of upper tp proves that the mean field does reproduce the topology of the phase diagram for the short - range model correctly , with the reservation that fluctuation - induced effects significantly shorten the interval between the bicritical and the upper tricritical points .",
    "finally , we apply the flowgram method to the self - dual version of the dcp action @xcite .",
    "we have identified the bicritical and the upper tricritical points , but no lower tp has been found .",
    "we directly observe the runaway flow to strong coupling and prove that its ultimate fate is a i - order transition . more specifically , for small @xmath7 , we observe data collapse with respect to the coupling strength rescaled by the system size @xmath12 .",
    "this collapse indicates the existence of an effective long - range coupling @xmath13 and proves that it is never weak in the @xmath14 limit : no matter how small is @xmath7 at short scales it always gets renormalized to @xmath15 where the i - order transition takes place .",
    "perfect data collapse continuously relating small @xmath7 to one for which i - order transition is observed at accessible sizes provides crucial evidence against lower tp and in support of the claim that the direct vbs - sf transition is always weakly i - order in accordance with the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm @xcite .",
    "on one hand , our results represent the first solution of the long - standing runaway problem for the two - component field - theory in question . on the other hand",
    ", they explain the outcome of recent numerical simulations which report either difficulties with finite - size scaling of the data @xcite or weakly i - order transitions @xcite in microscopic models of the sf - vbs transition .",
    "there are many equivalent formulations of the action describing multi - component scalar fields coupled by the abelian gauge field @xcite . in what follows we will concentrate on the case of two identical non - convertible components and",
    "will employ the integer - current lattice representation which can be viewed as either a high - temperature expansion for xy models in three dimensions , or as a path - integral ( world - line ) representation of the interacting quantum system in discrete imaginary time in @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "the dcp action is explicitly symmetric with respect to exchanging the components . after",
    "the gauge field is integrated out , it reads @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the lattice fourier transform of the long - range interaction potential @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 , which implies the asymptotic form @xmath21 .",
    "the summation over sites of the simple cubic space - time lattice with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath22 , is assumed .",
    "integer currents @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined on the lattice bonds and are subject to the zero - divergence , @xmath26 , constraint , i.e. the configuration space of @xmath27-currents is that of closed oriented loops , see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . in terms of particle world lines ,",
    "currents in the time direction represent occupation number fluctuations away from the commensurate filling , and currents in the spatial directions represent hopping events . in the discussion of the sf  vbs transition , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "currents in the dcp action represent world lines of spinons which are vbs vortices carrying fractional particle charge @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the insulating vbs state is characterized by small current loops ; the corresponding spinon order parameter , @xmath31 , is zero in this phase .",
    "when spinon world lines proliferate and grow macroscopically large , the system enters the superfluid state .",
    "the paired phase ( sfs ) occurs at large @xmath7 , when only loops in the @xmath32 channel grow macroscopically large . since bound pairs of spinons with opposite",
    "vorticity make particle and hole excitations , the sfs state is a superfluid with the solid vbs order , i.e. a supersolid .    as discussed above , many features of the dcp action are remarkably similar to those of a more conventional two - component bose - hubbard model @xcite with the short - range interaction potential @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "phase diagrams for the long- and short - range actions are shown in fig .",
    "different phases are identified in terms of loop sizes for @xmath35 and @xmath36 currents similar to the discussion given above : the mott insulator ( mi ) is characterized by small @xmath35- and @xmath36-loops , in the two - component sf there are macroscopically large @xmath35- and @xmath37-loops , and in the scf state only @xmath38 loops are macroscopically large .",
    "previous monte carlo data for the bh2 model ( [ ab ] ) did not agree with the mean field theory which describes the system in terms of three fields  @xmath39 for each component and @xmath40 for the paired field @xcite . omitting gradient terms the mean - field action",
    "is given by : @xmath41 + { 1 \\over 4 } \\big [ u_\\psi ( |\\psi_1|^4   +    |\\psi_2|^4 ) + u_\\phi |\\phi|^4   \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\gamma ( \\phi \\psi^*_1 \\psi_2 + \\rm{c.c . } ) \\ ; , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are some effective coefficients which depend on the bare coupling parameters @xmath43 in the action ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "trivial minimization of ( [ action ] ) with respect to the order parameter fields results in the phase diagram which can be formulated in terms of two dimensionless variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with all other coefficients rescaled to become unity @xcite .",
    "a sketch of the diagram is presented in fig .",
    "it features a continuous scf - mi transition , which terminates at bp point , as well as i - order mi - sf and scf - sf transitions .",
    "the scf - sf transition starts as a first - order line at bp and goes up to upper tp .",
    "then , it continues as a second ( ii ) order line for larger values of @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the mi - sf transition is of i - order type between bp and lower tp .",
    "then , it continues as a ii - order @xmath47 transition line towards the @xmath48 point where the components become decoupled .",
    "the length of the i - order line along the scf - sf boundary is predicted to be about two times shorter than that along the mi - sf line , see fig .",

    "the bold ( red ) solid line represents i - order transitions .",
    "dotted lines are used for ii - order transitions .",
    "the top of the solid line corresponds to upper tp , and the bottom  to lower tp .",
    "all three phase boundaries meet at bp . ]",
    "it is worth stressing that the i - order transition is induced by fluctuations of the paired field @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , one can approximately integrate @xmath49 out using gaussian approximation for this field and generate an effective interaction term @xmath50 .",
    "it destabilizes the system for sufficiently small @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "thus , the vicinity of bp must feature a i - order line ( along mi-2sf and scf-2sf ) .",
    "correspondingly , there are two minimal values of @xmath52  one for @xmath53 and the other for @xmath54  below which the transition becomes continuous along the respective boundaries .",
    "it is also important to realize that at the mean - field level there is no difference between the bh2 and dcp models .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite did find an extended i - order mi - sf boundary and lower tp , but failed to resolve conclusively bp and upper tp .",
    "standard numerical tools based on studies of hysteresis and probability distributions for the action were not precise enough for this system ( close to tp the i - order transition is very weak and hard to identify in finite - size simulations ) . in all other respects , the mean field theory and simulations agreed on the topology of the phase diagram .",
    "another important observation is that simulations of the same model ( [ ab ] ) in @xmath55 dimensions @xcite revealed an extended region of first - order transitions above bp .",
    "since @xmath56 is the upper critical dimension where fluctuations become essentially insignificant this result was expected .",
    "thus , an intriguing possibility has emerged that the predicted first - order transition is destroyed by fluctuations in @xmath57 .    in this work",
    "we apply a new flowgram method to perform a more refined analysis of the phase diagram in the vicinity of bp point and find that the scf - sf boundary does contain a i - order region in @xmath57 .",
    "the distance between bp and upper tp turns out to be an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by the mean - field theory .",
    "we attribute this to the fluctuation induced suppression of the pairing effect so that higher @xmath46 is required to produce the scf phase .    at this point",
    "one may ask why not to trust the mean - field theory on another prediction , namely , the existence of lower tp for the dcp action .",
    "the precise answer lies in how the effective coefficients in ( [ action ] ) depend on @xmath58 , and @xmath12 . for the short - range model ,",
    "the relation is rather straightforward , @xmath59 , leading to finite value of lower tp at some @xmath60 .",
    "ostensibly , the long - range nature of interaction in ( [ dcpa ] ) , which culminates in the runaway flow @xcite , makes the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath7 system size dependent through @xmath62 ( in leading order in @xmath7 ) and precludes simple perturbative reasoning for lower tp even for small @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "pairing correlations are never weak at large scales in the dcp action , and it is possible that this model is always above lower tp of the mean field theory ( [ action ] ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the flowgram method and apply it to the study of the short - range model ( [ ab ] ) . the most fundamental property of current loops responsible for the superfluid response of the system are winding numbers @xcite @xmath63 integer @xmath64 numbers count how many times @xmath65 currents wind around the system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the superfluid stiffness , @xmath66 , is directly proportional to @xmath67 . for any scale - invariant transition there should be @xmath68 loops of size @xmath69 in a volume @xmath70 , which implies that @xmath71 at criticality and directly leads to the josephson relation @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , at the continuous transition point not only the @xmath73 value but also the whole distribution function @xmath74 is universal since it is governed by the system behavior at the largest scale .    given close similarities between the dcp and bh2 phase diagrams it is convenient to introduce the following terminology : the transition line between phases with zero and non - zero @xmath75 winding number fluctuations is called a _",
    "neutral _ line ( described by proliferation of _ neutral _",
    "@xmath76 loops ) , and the transition line between phases with zero and non - zero @xmath77 winding number fluctuations is called a _ charged _ line ( described by proliferation of _ charged _",
    "@xmath78 loops in addition to the loops of @xmath79 which are already macroscopic ) .",
    "this terminology originates from the identification of @xmath27-currents as world line trajectories for charged spinon fields in the dcp action ; only @xmath80-currents are coupled by the long range coulomb potential . using this terminology , the scf - sf ( sfs - sf ) transition is a charged line and the mi - scf ( vbs - sfs ) transition is the neutral line ; the two lines merge at bp .",
    "notice that above bp the neutral winding number fluctuations @xmath81 on the charged line must exhibit linear growth with @xmath12 because the paired phase is characterized by finite stiffness ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lin ] ) . the same language will be used for the short - range action ( [ ab ] ) even though no coulomb potential is involved .    formally , in eq .",
    "( [ dcpa ] ) only @xmath82 numbers may have non - zero values in the thermodynamic limit . indeed , charged winding numbers couple to @xmath83 and thus are forbidden .",
    "however , charged loops of macroscopic size which simply do not wind around the system ( but are similar to winding loops otherwise ) are allowed and their contribution to the action can be estimated as @xmath84 ( one would get the same result for loops with non - zero winding numbers if the zero - momentum compotent of the interaction potential is `` regularized '' : @xmath85 ) .",
    "since @xmath86 imposes a global constraint on a single variable of the configuration space of the model it may not have any effect on the nature of the scale - invariant transition .",
    "for example , on approach to the critical point charged loops of larger and large size ( but smaller then @xmath87 ) will proliferate anyway .",
    "we remove the global constraint by setting @xmath88 for only one reason  to use non - zero winding number fluctuations as an indication of the deconfinement transition .",
    "we expect @xmath89 at the transition point .",
    "the advantage of looking at the @xmath90 numbers is that they are sensitive _ only _ to the deconfinement transition to the sf phase and remain zero in both the vbs and sfs phases .",
    "the key elements of the flowgram method are :    * introduce a definition of the critical point for finite - size systems consistent with the thermodynamic limit and insensitive to the transition order , + * at the transition point , calculate quantities which are scale - invariant for the continuous phase transition in question , vanish in one of the phases and diverge in another ; in our case such quantities are statistical averages of winding numbers squared , @xmath91 , + * study the flow of @xmath92 with system size @xmath12 for given model parameters . as far as the thermodynamic critical points are concerned",
    ", the critical values of the corresponding parameters in the action are naturally obtained by extrapolating the sequence of finite - size critical points to @xmath93 .    observing how @xmath94 scales with @xmath12 at the transition point allows studying the order of a transition , since @xmath95 has to saturate at some universal constant for second - order and to diverge for first - order transitions . moreover ,",
    "radical changes in the flowgram from saturation to divergence with an unstable separatrix in between as a function of coupling parameters is a clear sign of tp .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the flowgram method does not rely on detecting energy barriers between competing phases .",
    "it is simply based on phase coexistence typical for first - order transitions .",
    "we use the following definition of a transition point : for any given set of @xmath96 or @xmath97 we determine the critical value of @xmath98 from the condition that the ratio of probabilities of having zero and non - zero winding numbers is some fixed number @xmath99 of the order of unity : @xmath100 for the neutral and the charged lines , respectively .",
    "we use this particular criterion ( among many others ) because in the thermodynamic limit it gives exact answer for both second- and first - order transitions , since the ratio of probabilities in ( [ crit_def ] ) is zero in the superfluid phase and infinity in the insulating phase @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , at the critical point we compute @xmath101 . for the scale - invariant continuous transition one",
    "expects this quantity to approach its universal value as @xmath102 ; for the the i - order transition it has to diverge with @xmath12 since in the superfluid phase @xmath103 .",
    "the bicritical point is detected by observing vanishing charged winding numbers @xmath104 at the neutral line as @xmath12 is increased , and diverging , @xmath105 , neutral winding numbers on the charged transition line .",
    "close to the weakly i - order transition the ratios @xmath106 ( [ crit_def ] ) and averages @xmath101 exhibit strong fluctuations and are hard to compute precisely .",
    "however , fluctuations in @xmath101 are _ strongly correlated _ with fluctuations in @xmath106 .",
    "this property , known as covariance , can be used to reduce statistical errors @xcite .",
    "we have employed covariance , by plotting @xmath101 _ vs _ @xmath106 , to reduce error bars by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "the flowgram method also allows to  visualize \" the renormalization of coupling parameters .",
    "if data obtained for @xmath107 collapse on top of data for @xmath108 then one can consider this as an evidence that two systems are already in the scaling regime and are governed by the same effective coupling at large scales , @xmath109 . in practice , we plot data for @xmath110 as a function of @xmath111 where @xmath112 is some interaction - dependent length - scale , i.e. we study if system properties at large scales are identical for different coupling constants @xmath7 up to the length - scale renormalization and are part of the same renormalization flow . if true , all data points for the dcp model should collapse on a single master curve . in the limit of small @xmath7 , the runaway flow starts as @xmath113 @xcite , thus the length scale renormalization should follow the @xmath114 law .",
    "the most controversial region on the phase diagram for the bh2 model ( [ ab ] ) is located in the vicinity of bp , see fig .  [ fig1 ] , where previous simulations failed to resolve the difference between bp and upper tp .",
    "the standard feature of i - order transitions  a double - peak shape of the probability distribution for energy / action @xmath115  works reliably only if there is a significant barrier between two phases . on approach to tp",
    "the barrier vanishes and the double - peak distribution method fails to work .    using flowgrams one can identify the first - order transition even if no distinct discontinuity in system properties can be clearly seen . the cornerstone of the first - order transition is phase coexistence . in our case",
    "these phases are the insulator characterized by loops of small size ( in the corresponding channel ) and the superfluid in which the number of proliferated loops grows with the system size , so that the mean square winding number @xmath116 for large enough sizes .",
    "the statistical properties of such mixture are drastically different from those of the second - order transition point characterized by scaling behavior , where the same number of loops of size @xmath117 must be seen regardless of the ( large ) system size . the tricritical point",
    "is then characterized by the unstable separatrix separating the two limiting behaviors .    in fig .",

[ fig1inset ] ) is _ topologically _ identical to the mean field result @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a strong ( about an order of magnitude ) suppression of the i - order region above the bp due to strong fluctuation - induced corrections .",
    "the field theory of dcp , built on fractionalized spinons ( or vortices in the vbs phase ) , hints at the remarkable possibility of a _ generic _ continuous sf - vbs transition .",
    "obviously , such ii - order transition which occurs between phases characterized by different broken symmetries can not be derived from the conventional landau expansion in powers of the corresponding order parameter fields .",
    "one can not even justify the perturbative expansion because it should start from the fully disordered quantum groundstate which has no broken symmetries ( and topological orders ) .",
    "there are strong arguments that disordered quantum groundstate simply does not exist @xcite .",
    "another option is using a phenomenological landau theory which combines superfluid and solid orders into one multi - component order parameter with non - zero modulus as a ( non - perturbative ) constraint @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , predicts that sf - solid transitions are generically of first - order with the exception of special high - symmetry points .    at first glance ,",
    "dcp predictions are in sharp contradiction with the landau approach .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difficulty in the dcp theory , namely , the runaway renormalization flow to strong coupling which makes the idea of generic continuous sf - vbs transition speculative and without reliable analytical support @xcite . in the absence of stable perturbative fixed points other possibilities have to be explored as well .",
    "one alternative is that the dcp action is , in fact , a theory of generic i - order sf - vbs phase transitions ( ! ) contrary to the original predictions .",
    "early work on 3d scalar quantum electrodynamics @xcite did suggest that the renormalization flow leads to the i - order transition if the number of the matter - field components is relatively small ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "this prediction , however , is not taken seriously because it is known to be incorrect for the one - component system which , by the duality mapping @xcite , can be shown to have a continuous 3d xy transition .",
    "what happens in the multi - component case is a vast open problem in critical phenomena .",
    "it is worth noting , however , one aspect which is absent in the one - component case and becomes crucial in the case of two and more components it is the presence of paired phases that may intervene between insulator and sf .",
    "pairing effect was shown above to induce i - order superfluid - insulator transition for moderate coupling between components .",
    "paring correlations in combination with the runaway flow to strong coupling @xcite would provide a natural explanation for the generic weakly i - order sf - vbs transitions in the dcp theory , as conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram for the dcp action shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is not specific to the @xmath134current representation .",
    "a similar phase diagram is obtained for the xy phase - gauge field formulation of the theory ref .",
    "more refined and extensive simulations have shown that early monte carlo results for the easy - plane model mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , section iiia , did not go to sufficiently large system sizes to observe deviations from the power - law scaling and signatures of the weakly i - order transition @xcite .",
    "since for @xmath135 the length scale for observing the i - order transition , if any , is guaranteed to diverge , one has to be extremely careful in monitoring deviations from the scaling behavior expected for the continuous scale - invariant transition . in refs .",
    "@xcite the second - order sf - vbs transition with the correlation length exponent @xmath136 was deduced using straightforward power law fits of the data for system sizes @xmath137 . to make a point of comparison",
    ", we studied @xmath138 for the short - range model ( bh2 ) along the sf - mi line for system sizes @xmath139 using finite - size scaling of the superfluid density derivative , @xmath140 .",
    "we found that ( i ) the scaling curves are nearly perfect straight lines on the log - log plot from the bp all the way to the lower tp , ( ii ) good scaling with @xmath141 was observed up to @xmath142 _ in the middle of the i - order line ( ! ) _ , and ( iii ) in the upper half of the continuous @xmath47 sf - mi line the slope of the best linear fit produced a set of interaction dependent @xmath143 in the range between @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "this set of data is indicative of the fact that corrections to scaling are extremely important to take into account even for continuous transitions . with corrections to scaling included into the fits",
