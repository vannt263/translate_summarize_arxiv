    "one of the most important results from the @xmath64 collider hera is the observation that about @xmath65 of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) events exhibit a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) between the direction of the proton beam and that of the first significant energy deposition in the detector  @xcite .",
    "these lrg events , @xmath66 , result predominantly from the diffractive dissociation of the virtual photon , @xmath67 , and have been interpreted in terms of the exchange of a colour - singlet object known as the pomeron ( @xmath68 ) , introduced to describe the energy dependence of total cross sections in hadron - hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "the hera data @xcite have been analysed in terms of a diffractive structure function , @xmath69  @xcite , defined in analogy with the proton structure function , @xmath70 .",
    "the results are consistent with a `` resolved pomeron '' model where @xmath69 factorises into a regge - inspired pomeron flux and a pomeron structure function .",
    "the latter has been analysed @xcite using the dglap evolution equations .",
    "the extracted parton densities are dominated by gluons .",
    "alternatively , a number of qcd models @xcite has been proposed to describe diffraction in dis . in these models ,",
    "the virtual photon dissociates into a @xmath71 or @xmath72 state that interacts with the proton by the exchange of a gluon ladder .",
    "the diffractive cross section can then be formulated in terms of contributions from @xmath71 and @xmath72 final states .",
    "the @xmath72 component is expected to dominate the diffractive cross section at high masses , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the three - parton final state in both classes of models is that , in the rest frame of the system @xmath6 ( @xmath74 centre - of - mass system for the resolved pomeron model ) , the @xmath71 system tends to populate the virtual - photon hemisphere , while the gluon is emitted in the opposite direction ( the pomeron direction in the resolved pomeron model ) . in the resolved pomeron model ,",
    "the gluon is the remnant of the pomeron left after the boson - gluon fusion process has produced a @xmath71 pair ; as a remnant , it follows the original pomeron direction . in dipole models , to leading order , the gluon in the @xmath72 fluctuation from the virtual photon either couples directly to the exchanged gluon ladder or emerges from it , depending on the reference frame . in this case also , therefore , it follows the direction of the gluon ladder ( @xmath75 pomeron in resolved pomeron model ) and the @xmath71 pair carries on in the direction of the virtual photon .",
    "studies of the hadronic final state and jet production in diffractive interactions have been presented by both h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite . in this paper , the jet - like structure of the hadronic final state",
    "is studied with the aim of isolating three - parton final states by selecting three - jet events . as was already observed in @xmath76 experiments @xcite ,",
    "three - jet topologies can be clearly separated only for centre - of - mass energies above about 20 gev .",
    "the measurements are thus performed in a restricted phase - space region populated by high - mass diffractive systems .",
    "such systems are a small fraction of the total diffractive cross section .",
    "they are separated from a substantial background of non - diffractive processes by requiring a large rapidity gap .",
    "a search is made for jets using an algorithm that allows the study of jet configurations aligned with respect to the @xmath74 axis and ensures good parton - hadron correlations .",
    "the properties of the three - jet final states are used to test the expectation that the gluon from the dominant @xmath72 contribution is emitted in the pomeron direction .",
    "cross sections are presented as a function of the jet pseudorapidity and jet transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath74 axis .",
    "in addition , the internal structure of the jets is measured for jets found in either the photon or the pomeron directions , with the aim of distinguishing between quark- and gluon - initiated jets .",
    "the different measurements are compared to models of diffraction in dis .",
    "the data were collected with the zeus detector at hera during 1998 - 2000 when hera collided 27.6 gev electrons or positrons range studied , @xmath77 and @xmath78 scattering are assumed to give identical results since contributions from @xmath79 exchange are negligible . ] on 920 gev protons .",
    "a total of @xmath80  pb@xmath1 of @xmath81 data and @xmath82  pb@xmath1 of @xmath83 data was used .",
    "a detailed description of the zeus detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a brief outline of the most relevant components for this analysis is given below .",
    "the zeus high - resolution uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal ) @xcite covers @xmath84 of the total solid angle .",
    "it is divided into three parts with respect to the polar angle axis pointing in the proton beam direction , referred to as the `` forward direction '' , and the @xmath6 axis pointing left towards the centre of hera .",
    "the coordinate origin is at the nominal interaction point .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath85 , where the polar angle , @xmath86 , is measured with respect to the proton beam direction . ] as viewed from the nominal interaction point : forward ( fcal ) , rear ( rcal ) and barrel ( bcal ) calorimeters .",
    "each part is subdivided longitudinally into electromagnetic ( emc ) and hadronic ( hac ) sections .",
    "the cal energy resolution , as measured in test - beams , is @xmath87 for positrons and @xmath88 for hadrons .",
    "charged particles were tracked by the central tracking detector ( ctd ) @xcite , which operates in a magnetic field of 1.43 t provided by a thin superconducting coil . the ctd is a drift chamber consisting of 72 cylindrical layers , organised in 9 superlayers , covering the region @xmath89 .",
    "the transverse momentum resolution for full - length tracks is @xmath90 , with @xmath91 in gev .    in 1998 ,",
    "a forward plug calorimeter ( fpc ) @xcite was installed in the @xmath92 @xmath93 beam hole of the fcal with a small hole of radius @xmath94 cm in the centre of the fpc to accommodate the beam pipe .",
    "this increased the forward calorimetric coverage by about 1 unit of pseudorapidity to @xmath95 .",
    "the fpc consisted of a lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeter divided into electromagnetic and hadronic sections which were read out separately by wavelength - shifting fibres and photomultipliers .",
    "the emc ( hac ) sections were segmented into cells of @xmath96 @xmath93 ( @xmath97 @xmath93 ) area and constituted a total of 76 read - out channels .",
    "the energy resolution was @xmath98 and @xmath99 for positrons and pions , respectively , where the energies are measured in units of gev @xcite .",
    "the small - angle rear tracking detector ( srtd ) @xcite was used to measure the position of those positrons scattered at a sufficiently small angle to strike it .",
    "it consists of two planes of scintillator strips attached to the front face of the rcal .",
    "the srtd signals resolve single minimum - ionizing particles and provide a position resolution of 0.3 cm .",
    "the position of those positrons falling outside the srtd acceptance was measured in the cal .",
    "the luminosity was measured via the positron - proton bremsstrahlung process , @xmath100 , using a lead - scintillator calorimeter ( lumi ) @xcite located at @xmath101 m in the hera tunnel .",

    "two further variables are introduced : @xmath112 in resolved pomeron models , where the interaction is described as the exchange of a particle - like pomeron , @xmath113 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron and @xmath114 is the fraction of its momentum carried by the parton within it that is probed by the virtual photon .",
    "three monte carlo ( mc ) models for the diffractive deep inelastic process @xmath111 have been considered in order to describe the diffractive hadronic final state .    the rapgap 2.08/06 mc generator @xcite implements the ingelman - schlein factorisable model @xcite for the pomeron .",

    ", it became clear that neither ridi nor satrap gave a reasonable description of the data .",
    "as discussed in section 8 , this was traced to inadequacies in the implementation of the modelling of higher - order qcd processes in these models .",

    "a new implementation of higher - order qcd processes in satrap was carried out @xcite , in which the cdm approach was implemented in a similar fashion to that in rapgap .",
    "this model is referred to as satrap - cdm .",

    "the variables @xmath130 and @xmath109 were determined from the information of the scattered positron . the hadronic final - state system , @xmath6 , resulting from the dissociation of the virtual photon ,",

    "events with @xmath147 were selected , where @xmath148 is the pseudorapidity of the most - forward cluster with energy above 400 mev , as measured in the cal and fpc ; * at least three reconstructed efos in the hadronic final state to ensure that the event plane could be determined .",

    "the cross section in these models is dominated by configurations strongly aligned with respect to the @xmath74 axis in the forward region . as already mentioned , this is most probably a consequence of the inadequacies of the implementation of the modelling of higher - order qcd processes in these models . in satrap - cdm ,",
    "the shape and normalisation of the @xmath176 distribution is in better agreement with the data .",
    "+ in all models , the gluon in the @xmath72 final state is emitted with very small transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath74 axis .",
    "the contributions from higher - order qcd processes are expected to be important and to influence the kinematics of the corresponding hadron jet which , due to string effects , tends to have smaller pseudorapidity ( larger transverse momentum ) compared to the initial parton . given the @xmath230 requirement applied in defining the measured cross sections , the absolute predictions from these models depend on an appropriate treatment of these higher - order qcd emissions and a proper description of the forward hadron - jet dynamics ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "this is particularly clear in the case of satrap , which fails to reproduce the three - jet data but provides a good description of inclusive diffractive dis  @xcite .",
    "the differential jet shapes , @xmath231 , were measured for the most - forward and most - backward jet in three - jet events , where the forward region is defined by the pomeron direction .",
    "the measurements were performed in the @xmath74 centre - of - mass frame for jets with energy , @xmath174 , above 9  gev .",
    "this requirement removes the contributions from the least - energetic jet in the event which , in the @xmath73-range considered and for the given @xmath159 , has energy below this threshold and for which hadronisation effects on the jet shape are expected to be important .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the measured jet shapes compared with the rapgap - cdm predictions ( the satrap - cdm predictions , not shown , are almost identical ) .",
    "the jet in the pomeron direction is broader than the jet in the photon direction .",
    "these measurements are described by models in which a gluon populates the pomeron hemisphere and a quark is found in the photon direction .",
    "the energy distribution of the two jets is similar , indicating that the observed difference in the measured jet shapes can be ascribed to the different nature of the initial partons .",
    "moreover , the difference between the jet shapes in the pomeron and photon directions is qualitatively similar to that between quark- and gluon - initiated jets as measured in @xmath76 experiments @xcite .",
    "this measurement therefore supports the validity of the picture where the three - body final state is dominated by a @xmath72 configuration with the gluon preferentially emitted in the pomeron direction .",
    "multi - jet production has been studied in the kinematic region @xmath2 gev@xmath121 , @xmath4 gev , @xmath5 gev and @xmath196 , for diffractive events with @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "a study of three - jet production , using the exclusive @xmath7-algorithm with @xmath178 in the centre - of - mass system of the hadronic final state , has been presented .",
    "the rate of three - jet production has been measured to be @xmath232 of the diffractive jet cross section , and is consistent with being independent of @xmath130 and @xmath73 .",
    "the topologies of the three - jet final states have been studied in terms of the jet fractional - momentum variables @xmath233 and @xmath187 ; all possible topologies have been observed .",
    "the distribution of the events in the ( @xmath217 ) plane shows that , for a given @xmath159 , the favoured topologies are those for which one leading jet carries approximately twice the energy of either of the other two jets @xmath218 .",
    "differential cross sections for three - jet production have been measured as a function of the jet pseudorapidity , @xmath205 , and jet transverse momentum , @xmath176 , with respect to the @xmath74 axis .",
    "the total cross section for three - jet production , determined by integrating the @xmath205 distribution , is @xmath234 .",
    "the @xmath176 distribution for the most - forward jet is dominated by configurations with @xmath176 below 3 gev but exhibits a long tail towards larger values , reflecting the presence of higher - order qcd contributions .",
    "the differential jet shapes , @xmath235 , of the two most - energetic jets in three - jet events have been measured .",
    "the jet in the pomeron direction is broader and consistent with the shape of gluon - initiated jets as predicted by diffractive mc models .",
    "+ the data are broadly consistent with models in which the hadronic final - state is dominated by a @xmath72 system with the gluon preferentially emitted in the pomeron direction .",
    "such configurations are predicted both by resolved pomeron models ( as implemented in rapgap ) with a pomeron dominated by gluons , and by models where the virtual photon dissociates in a @xmath72 system which interacts with the proton via the exchange of a gluon ladder ( as implemented in satrap and ridi ) .",
    "rapgap provides a reasonable description of the measured distributions , although it underestimates the measured cross section by about @xmath228 .",
    "this deficit may be attributed to the absence of next - to - leading - order corrections , which are only included approximately via parton cascades .",
    "the predictions from satrap and ridi fail to describe the shape and normalisation of the @xmath205 and @xmath176 distributions .",
    "however , it has been shown that an improved implementation of the modelling of higher - order qcd processes in satrap - cdm gives reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "thus , the study of three jets in diffraction constitutes a very sensitive method to investigate the dynamics of diffractive deep inelastic scattering .      the strong support and encouragement of the desy directorate",
