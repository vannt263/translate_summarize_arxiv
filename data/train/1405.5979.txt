    "imagine travelling between three locations such as eindhoven ( @xmath4 , a medium - sized town in the netherlands ) , a parking lot @xmath5 on the border of the dutch capital amsterdam , and the city center @xmath6 of amsterdam . in figure",
    "[ fig : epa ] the travel times by car between these locations are depicted by the leftmost triangle , while the travel times by bike are depicted by the second triangle .",
    "the large distances between @xmath4 and either @xmath5 or @xmath6 are covered much faster by car than by bike . on the other hand , because of crowded streets , the short distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is covered considerably faster by bike than by car . as a consequence , an attractive alternative for travelling from @xmath4 to @xmath6 by car",
    "is to travel by car from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and continue by bike to @xmath6 . in other words , to get from @xmath4 to @xmath6 we first do a step in the car metric and then a step in the bike metric , where we optimise the sum of the two travel times .",
    "computing this _ car - bike metric _ for the remaining ordered pairs leads to the picture on the right in figure  [ fig : epa ] .",
    "the corresponding matrix computation is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is _ tropical _ or _ min - plus _ matrix multiplication , obtained from usual matrix multiplication by changing plus into minimum and times into plus .",
    "note that the resulting matrix is not symmetric ( the transpose corresponds to the `` first bike , then car '' metric ) , and that it does not satisfy the triangle inequality either .",
    "the bike metric and the car metric were both picked from the @xmath9-dimensional cone of symmetric matrices satisfying all triangle inequalities .",
    "hence one might think that such tropical products sweep out a @xmath10-dimensional set .",
    "however , if we perturb the travel times in the two metric matrices slightly , then their min - plus product moves only in a _",
    "three_-dimensional space , where the entry at position @xmath11 remains the sum of the entries in positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while the entry in position @xmath14 moves freely .",
    "this preservation of dimension when tropically multiplying cones of distance matrices is one of the key results of this paper .    while keeping this min - plus product in the back of our minds , we next contemplate the following different setting .",
    "three gossipers , eve , patricia , and adam , each have an individual piece of gossip , which they can share through one - to - one phone calls in which both callers update each other on all the gossip they know .",
    "record the knowledge of @xmath15 in a three - by - three uncertainty matrix with entries @xmath16 ( for `` @xmath17 s gossip is known by @xmath18 '' ) and @xmath19 ( for the other entries ) . then initially that matrix is the _ tropical identity matrix _",
    ", with zeroes along the diagonal and @xmath19 outside the diagonal .",
    "a phone call beteen @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for example , corresponds to tropically right - multiplying that tropical identity matrix matrix with @xmath20 resulting in this very same matrix .",
    "a second phone call between @xmath5 and @xmath6 leads to @xmath21 note the resemblance of this computation with the car - bike metric computation above .",

    ", where each phone call between gossipers @xmath22 and @xmath23 comes with a parameter @xmath24 $ ] to be interpreted as the fraction of information that gets broadcast correctly through the phone line , and where each gossiper @xmath18 knows a fraction @xmath25 $ ] of @xmath17 s gossip .",
    "assume the ( admittedly simplistic ) procedure where @xmath22 updates his knowledge of gossip @xmath17 to @xmath26 if this is larger than @xmath27 and retains his knowledge @xmath27 of gossip @xmath17 otherwise , and similarly for gossiper @xmath23 . in this manner",

    "lossy gossip is tropical matrix multiplication_. note that lossy gossip is different from _ gossip over faulty telephone lines _ discussed in @xcite , and also from gossip algorithms via multiplication of doubly stochastic matrices as in @xcite ( though the elementary matrices @xmath39 there are reminiscent of our matrices @xmath40 ) .",
    "this paper concerns the entirety of such uncertainty matrices , or compositions of finite metrics .",
    "our main result uses the following notation : fixing a number @xmath2 ( of gossipers or vertices ) , let @xmath41 be the set of all _ metric _ @xmath0 matrices , i.e. , matrices with entries @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for standard notions in polyhedral geometry",

    "the _ surplus length _ of a detour from @xmath17 to @xmath18 is defined as the difference between the length of the detour and the minimal distance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the graph .",

    "is indicated by an asterix @xmath229 .",
    "this shows that the cones in the grey boxes intersect in a cone of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the intersection between @xmath227 and @xmath228 is obtained by setting equal certain surplus lengths in the graphs representing @xmath227 and @xmath228 . ]",
    "these graphs were obtained as follows .",
    "first , generate all @xmath230 possible piecewise linear affine maps @xmath46 ^ 6 \\rightarrow g_4 $ ] of the form @xmath231 where @xmath232 are unordered pairs of distinct indices . among the image cones ,",
    "select only the six - dimensional ones , and compute their linear spans .",
    "there are 289 different linear spans .",
    "compute the @xmath226-orbits on these spans ; this yields @xmath233 orbits . choose a representative for each of these orbits on spans , and for each representative select all cones with that span .",
    "it turns out that , for each representative span , one of the cones contains all other cones . to show that the orbits of these 16 maximal cones give all of @xmath162 , left - multiply each of these 16 cones with all possible lossy phone call matrices and",
    "show that the resulting unions of cones are contained in the union of the 289 maximal cones ; this is facilitated by the fact that each of these cones is the intersection of @xmath162 with ( the topological closure in @xmath46^{n \\times n}$ ] of ) a six - dimensional subspace .",
    "then we check that the faces of these 289 six - dimensional cones do indeed form a polyhedral fan , i.e. , that the intersection of any two of these faces is a common face of both . in the process of this check , which we performed both with ` mathematica ` and ( more rapidly ) with ` polymake ` @xcite , we find that the fan has @xmath234-vector @xmath235 .",
    "this latter check yields the statement about the unique coarsest fan structure in theorem  [ thm : n234 ] .",
    "next , the group @xmath236 acts on @xmath162 by transposition .",
    "taking orbit representatives under the larger group @xmath237 from among the @xmath233 yields 11 cones . among these , 9 are simplicial ( have six facets ) , the cone @xmath185 has 12 facets , and the remaining cone has 9 facets .",
    "the cone @xmath185 is the union of three simplicial cones ( see figure  [ fig : optgraphs4 ] ) , which are permuted by @xmath226 , so we need only one .",
    "this is @xmath238 in figure  [ fig : cones_s4 ] .",
    "the cone with @xmath239 facets turns out to be the union of two simplicial cones . splitting this up yields @xmath240 and @xmath228 in the figure .",
    "it turns out that each @xmath241 is the image of @xmath204 under a linear map into @xmath242 with non - negative integral entries with respect to the standard bases , and that these maps can be realised using weighted , labelled graphs with detours .",
    "these are the graphs in the picture .",
    "the graphs without the detours realise the kleene star @xmath152 with @xmath243 .",
    "finally , connectivity in codimension @xmath54 is proved by figure [ fig : connected ] .",
    "it shows that any maximal cone can be connected to @xmath185 by passing through ( relatively open ) codimension - one faces ; note the specified labelling .",
    "most intersections in figure [ fig : connected ] are of a simple type , where one of the edge weights becomes zero to go from one cone to the neighbouring cone ; these contracted edges are then marked with an asterix on both sides .",
    "the only exception is the connection from @xmath227 to @xmath228 .",
    "although ( suitable elements in the @xmath226-orbits of ) these cones intersect in a five - dimensional boundary cone , the boundary cone is obtained from the parametrizations specified by the graphs with detours by restricting the parametrization to a hyperplane where two of the weights are equal .",
    "this leads to the following theorem .",
    "the cones realised by the graphs of figure [ fig : cones_s4 ] give a polyhedral fan structure on @xmath162 .",
    "this polyhedral fan is pure of dimension @xmath205 and connected in codimension @xmath54 .",
    "its intersection with a sphere around the origin is a simplicial spherical complex .",
    "moreover , every element of @xmath162 is the product of ( at most ) @xmath205 lossy phone call matrices .",
    "the spherical complex of figure  [ fig : s3 ] clearly has trivial homology .",
    "this phenomenon persists for @xmath214 : a computation using ` polymake ` shows that all homology groups of the intersection of @xmath162 with the unit sphere in @xmath233-dimensional space are zero .",
    "we do not know whether this is true for general @xmath2 .",
    "more extensive computations establish the claimed facts about @xmath244 . since @xmath230 is a small number , but",
    "@xmath245 is not , the computation requires many refinements .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "it turns out that every element has an expression as a tropical product of at most 10 lossy phone call matrices .",
