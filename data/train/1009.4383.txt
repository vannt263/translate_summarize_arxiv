    "motivated by the algorithmic problem of searching large graphs , we study the expansion properties of real - world networks and the extent to which these properties can be exploited to better understand and facilitate decentralized search .",
    "complex networks of linked entities arise across diverse domains , from sociology ( e.g. social networks ) to biology ( e.g. neural networks , protein interactions ) to technological and information systems ( e.g. p2p networks , the web , power grids ) .",
    "scientists from disparate fields , especially within the past decade , have attempted to characterize both the structure and function of these networked systems .",
    "the standard approach here has been to measure topological features of the graph representing the network and correlate them with functional or dynamic aspects of the network ( e.g. evolution of the network , the behavior of processes that occur over the network ) .",
    "for instance , in their seminal paper on small - world networks , watts and strogatz @xcite showed that many real - world networks simultaneously exhibit short average path lengths and relatively high degrees of clustering .",
    "they further showed that these features can facilitate spreading processes across a network ( e.g. the spread of a virus ) @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study a feature that has received comparatively less attention in the study of real - world - regular graphs and 2 ) the _ minimum _ ( not maximum ) expansion in these graphs @xcite . ]",

    "expansion_.      given a network @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the set of links among the nodes , the _ expansion _ of a set of nodes @xmath3 is a function of the number of nodes in @xmath4 to which @xmath5 is connected ( see section [ sec : preliminaries ] for more precise definitions ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath6 is the set of nodes to which @xmath5 is connected , then the _ expansion _ of @xmath5 is @xmath7 .",
    "informally , an expander graph is a graph in which any subset of nodes has good expansion ( i.e. has many neighbors ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , a network is said to be a @xmath8-expander if every @xmath3 has an expansion of _ at least _",
    "@xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , the classical definition of an expander graph focuses on samples with the _ minimum _ expansion ( as @xmath8 is a minimum if every sample @xmath5 has an expansion of at least @xmath8 ) .",
    "expander graphs have been shown to have many applications from constructing error correcting codes to routing calls in telephone switching networks @xcite .",
    "although these classical expander graphs are well - studied , there has been surprisingly less attention paid to studying the sample in a network with the _ maximum _ expansion , and it is this in which we are most interested .",
    "our overall aim in this work is to investigate the extent to which a vertex set with high expansion can be leveraged to both understand and facilitate efficient decentralized search in networks .",
    "we now describe the problem of decentralized search .",
    "a central algorithmic problem in the study of complex networks is how to efficiently search them in a decentralized manner .",
    "this scenario arises in many practical applications from querying peer - to - peer file sharing networks to focused web crawling @xcite . starting from some initial source node",
    ", we must locate , access , or route a message to some other target node in the network . without full knowledge of the global network topology , we are unable to simply compute the shortest path or access the target node directly .",
    "thus , we must hop from node to node until the target node is found .",
    "decentralized search , then , is related to information diffusion or dissemination , as an efficient search will involve efficiently disseminating a query message to large portions of the network . in this work",
    ", we study the effect of network expansion on decentralized search .",
    "if , using only local information , nodes are visited in such a way that their overall distance is close to many other nodes ( i.e. the set of visited nodes has high expansion ) , then the efficiency of search might be improved . moreover ,",
    "the magnitude of expansion in a network may shed light on the extent to which a network can be efficiently searched by _ any _ search algorithm .",
    "these are precisely the questions we investigate here .",
    "we rigorously investigate decentralized search across a span of networks much wider and more diverse than previously studied in work on searching graphs .",
    "our main contributions include the following :    * borrowing from concepts in expander graphs , we introduce the concept of _ expansion signatures _ , which concisely captures the overall expansion properties of a network .",
    "we find that , in many networks , relatively small samples of nodes can exhibit significantly high expansion .",
    "however , we also find that there are a few networks for which small samples with high expansion may not exist .",
    "* we propose an expansion - based , decentralized search strategy , which explicitly tries to locate these samples with high expansion in order to quickly discover the most nodes in a search .",
    "we evaluate a number of search algorithms such as degree - based searches , breadth - first searches , and random walks .",
    "we show that an expansion - based search strategy generally outperforms others . *",
    "we demonstrate that _ expansion signatures _ correctly infer the extent to which a network can be efficiently searched ( which we refer to as `` searchability '' ) .",
    "moreover , we show that it is the maximum expansion in a network , rather than the minimum expansion , that contributes most to searchability and information dissemination in a network . at the same time",
    ", we find that standard graph - theoretic measures , such as average path length , _ fail _ to fully explain the extent to which a network is easily searched .",
    "the last point is our most significant finding .",
    "existing works have mostly studied the effect of _ minimum _ expansion on the ease of dissemination in a network ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other works have focused on the effect of standard graph properties such as average path length on searchability and ease of dissemination ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time , we show that it is the _ maximum _ expansion ( rather than minimum expansion ) that most affects efficient searchability . our results , then , offer a more comprehensive picture of decentralized search and information diffusion in networks than has previously been appreciated .",
    "interestingly , one of the first experiments on decentralized search in networks was the famous chain - letter study by the social psychologist stanley milgram @xcite . in this experiment , participants were given the name , address , and occupation of an unknown target person and told to forward a chain letter to this person by passing the letter on to a single acquaintance meeting two main conditions : 1 ) the acquaintance must be someone with whom the individual knew on a first - name basis and 2 ) the acquaintance chosen should be the one perceived as closest to the target @xcite .",
    "this study not only provided some evidence for short paths in social networks ( the median path length between sources and targets was @xmath10 among letters that reached their destination ) , but also showed that individuals were able to collectively discover these short paths _ without _ full knowledge of the network @xcite .",
    "kleinberg @xcite later modeled this problem algorithmically using a 2-dimensional grid with probabilistically - added long - range connections and shed light on the precise conditions that these short paths were discoverable using a decentralized search algorithm .    in both the works of milgram @xcite and kleinberg @xcite , although nodes had no knowledge of global network connectivity , there was , in fact , _ external _ knowledge that aided searches . in the milgram experiment , for instance",
    ", individuals were instructed to forward letters to the local acquaintance that was perceived as being closest to the target - as measured by geographic or occupational similarity in many cases .",
    "thus , external knowledge of geographical distance and occupational similarity was employed as an aid in the search heuristic . in other words",
    ", there was knowledge ( or , at least , an assumption ) that individuals closer geographically or more similar occupationally are more likely to know each other .",
    "liben - nowell et al .",
    "@xcite , in fact , showed some evidence for the geographical basis of online friendships in the livejournal social network . in kleinberg s model",
    "also , it is assumed that message holders have access to external knowledge and know the local contacts of _ all _ nodes in the network ( i.e. nodes are aware of the manhattan distances between all nodes in the underlying grid structure and use this information as a forwarding heuristic ) .",
    "boguna et al .",
    "@xcite have recently modeled this external information as a hidden metric space .",
    "unfortunately , in many real - world scenarios , such as unstructured peer - to - peer file sharing networks , these types of external information and similarity - based heuristics are unavailable as search aids , and the problem of decentralized search becomes even more challenging .",
    "typical approaches here resort to variations on flooding the network ( which can be unscalable ) , random walks ( which may be less effective in finding information ) , or imposing structure on the network to improve searchability ( which requires additional overhead ) @xcite . for",
    "a review of decentralized search both in the contexts of complex networks and specifically p2p , one may refer to @xcite .",
    "our focus in this work is to investigate efficient search on networks with _ arbitrary _ structure in which similarity - based heuristics ( e.g. geographic distance ) are unavailable .",
    "for the first time , we investigate the relationship between _ expansion _ and the extent to which a network is efficiently searchable .",
    "we further show that a search strategy based on expansion generally outperforms typical existing approaches such as random walks and flooding - based techniques .",
    "we begin a discussion of our work with some preliminaries .",
    "we now briefly describe some notations and definitions used throughout this paper .",

    "notice that , given a sample @xmath5 , the maximum possible expansion on _ any _ network of @xmath18 nodes is : @xmath19 .",
    "the _ expansion quality _ @xmath20 , then , captures the extent to which a sample achieves this maximum possible expansion .",
    "a score of @xmath21 indicates that the sample `` touches '' or is one hop away from every other node in the network .",
    "we study expansion and search in a total of ten different networks : two random graph models , a neural network , a power grid , a co - authorship network , an email network , a citation network , a p2p file - sharing network , and two online social networks .",
    "it should be noted that not all of these networks may require efficient decentralized search ( e.g. a co - authorship network , the neural network of a worm ) .",
    "nevertheless , these datasets represent a rich set of diverse networks from different domains .",
    "this allows us to more comprehensively study network expansion and thoroughly assess the performance of decentralized search strategies in the face of varying network topologies .",
