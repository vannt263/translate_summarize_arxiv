    "at the time of discovery , supernova ( sn ) 2006gy was the most luminous sn ever found @xcite",
    ".   generated a great deal of interest ; in addition to being @xmath3100 times more luminous than a typical type ii ( hydrogen - rich , core - collapse ) sn at peak , it exhibited a long rise time ( @xmath370 day ) and slow decline , leading to speculation that it may have been the first observed example of a pair - instability sn ( @xcite ) or a pulsational pair - instability sn @xcite .",
    "was classified as a type iin sn ( see @xcite for a definition of the type iin subclass and @xcite for a review of its spectral properties ) based on the relatively narrow emission features present in the early - time sn spectrum @xcite . some type iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) are known to be overluminous relative to their typical sn  ii counterparts , probably due to the collision of fast - moving sn ejecta and a dense , possibly clumpy , circumstellar medium ( csm ; @xcite ) . in a companion paper @xcite , a detailed spectroscopic comparison of  is made to other sne  iin .",
    "is unique within the sn  iin subclass , however , because typical interaction models can not explain its early - time behavior , suggesting the need for alternative models for this particular object @xcite .",
    "pair - instability sne @xcite are expected to occur in very massive , low - metallicity stars , such as those that may have been present in the metal - free environment of the very early universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of a pair - instability sn in the comparatively local universe , then , could potentially reveal a great deal about the first generation of stars .",
    "the light curves of pair - instability sne are expected to exhibit a relatively slow rise , followed by a broad turnover after the peak , and a peak luminosity that is considerably larger than that of typical sne @xcite .",
    "qualitatively each of these characteristics matches those observed for .",
    "other more luminous sne have been announced since the discovery of : sne 2005ap @xcite and 2008es @xcite .",
    "this suggests that while these events are rare , there may be a new subclass of very luminous supernovae ( vlsne ) .",
    "the peak luminosity and photometric evolution of both sne 2005ap and 2008es are difficult to explain via the pair - instability model @xcite , implying that peak luminosities @xmath5 few @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 are possible without a pair - instability explosion .",
    "there is a wide diversity of alternative models that have been developed to explain the early - time observations of .",
    "@xcite argue that the peak luminosity and light - curve evolution can be explained via the thermalization of shock energy deposited into a massive ( @xmath310 ) , optically thick shell .",
    "similar explanations were offered for sne 2005ap and 2008es @xcite . based on a model of the light curve near peak ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the combination of ejecta colliding with dense clumps in the csm and @xmath313   of @xmath4ni are responsible for the early - time luminosity of .",
    "@xcite are unable to match the light curve with a standard pair - instability sn model ; however , they can reasonably reproduce the ( @xmath7400 day ) light curve of  using a pair - instability model where they artificially reduce the ejecta mass , such that the radioactive heating is less than 100% efficient .",
    "@xcite use a model of a pulsational pair instability within a massive star to explain the light curve of .",
    "some of the models make predictions for the late - time behavior of .",
    "those with a large yield of @xmath4ni @xcite would expect a decline in bolometric luminosity at the rate of @xmath4co deay , 0.98 mag ( 100 day)@xmath9 , or faster if the radioactive - decay energy is not converted to optical emission with 100% efficiency .",
    "the shell - shock model @xcite predicts a rapid decline after @xmath3200 day , though the authors note that this decline may be offset by the production of a large amount of @xmath4ni or continued csm interaction . the pulsational pair - instability model @xcite predicts another sn explosion at the location of  about 9 years after the initial outburst from .",
    "more than a year after the explosion , @xcite detected  in the near - infrared ( nir ) at a luminosity comparable to that of the peak luminosity of most sne  ii .",
    "this property had not been predicted by any of the models . when coupled with the lack of a detection in the radio and x - rays , this led @xcite to conclude that the luminosity could not be powered by the continued interaction of the sn ejecta with csm . @xcite",
    "draw similar conclusions based on their detection of weak h@xmath10 emission at a comparable epoch .",
    "@xcite conclude that only two possibilities are able to explain the late - time observations of : ( i ) the explosion produced @xmath52.5 of @xmath4ni , possibly as a pair - production sn , which was heating dust and consequently generating the large nir excess , or ( ii ) a massive ( @xmath3510 ) , dusty shell , located @xmath31 light year from the site of the sn , was being heated by the radiation produced at peak , and re - radiated that energy as a nir echo @xcite .",
    "for the first case , if the luminosity were powered by radioactive decay , then future observations should indicate a continued decline at the rate of @xmath4co decay .",
    "a dust echo , on the other hand , would result in a nir light curve that stays roughly constant for @xmath312 years before exhibiting a rapid decline",
    ".    evolved massive stars , such as red super giants and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , are often observed with massive dust shells , so if these stars explode as type iin sne one might expect a late - time ir echo .",
    "many sne  iin have been observed to exhibit a late - time nir excess @xcite which in some cases lasted @xmath0 1 year .",
    "this excess has been attributed to nir echoes @xcite , though we note that the formation of new dust has been argued specifically for sn 1998s @xcite and sn 1995n @xcite .",
    "dusty regions near the sn should also lead to uv / optical scattered light echoes @xcite ; thus , dust is capable of providing significant optical and nir emission at late times .",
    "the optical decline of type iin sne at late times is very heterogeneous @xcite , and therefore caution must be applied when determining the source of any late - time emission .    in this paper",
    "we present new nir observations of , taken around the peak of optical emission , as well as optical and nir observations obtained more than two years after  exploded . in @xmath11 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "we discuss the results in @xmath11 3 , and in @xmath11 4 we offer some conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the distance to ngc 1260 ( the host galaxy of ) is 73.1 mpc , and that the total color excess toward  is @xmath12 mag @xcite , of which @xmath13 mag is in ngc 1260 and galactic extinction accounts for @xmath14 mag .",
    "all spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have been corrected for this color excess assuming @xmath15 using the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "nir observations of  were obtained simultaneously in   with the peters automated infrared imaging telescope ( pairitel ; @xcite ) starting on 2006 october 13 ( 54 day after explosion ) .",
    "pairitel is a 1.3-m robotic telescope , located on mt .",
    "hopkins , az , which obtained observations for 30 min to 1 hr at each epoch through normal queue - scheduled operations for the next 24 months . in total",
    "there were 124 epochs obtained .",
    "all images were processed via an automated pipeline @xcite .",
    "analysis of  has proved challenging because the sn is located very close to the nucleus of ngc 1260 ( separation @xmath16 1@xmath17 ; @xcite ) .",
    "pairitel has a large native scale of 2@xmath17 pixel@xmath9 , precluding spatial resolution of the sn from the nucleus .",
    "this necessitates image differencing to obtain the light curve of the sn .",
    "image subtraction was performed with hotpants , and the flux in each difference pair was determined via aperture photometry at the location of the sn .",
    "an example subtraction , which clearly shows flux from  after the reference image has been subtracted , is shown in figure  [ ptel - subtract ] .    despite observations extending more than two years past the date of discovery ,",
    "has not faded beyond the point of detectability with pairitel .",
    "consequently , all  images of  contain some flux from the sn .",
    "we thus adopted the `` nn2 method '' of @xcite to determine the relative nir flux changes of the sn .",
    "the nn2 method treats all images equally and does not require a template image with no light from the source of interest , .",
    "it uses the subtraction of all @xmath18 possible pairs of images to mitigate against possible errors associated with the use of a single reference template image .",
    "the downside to the nn2 method is that it only produces the differential flux between each of the @xmath19 epochs of observations . to convert these flux differences into magnitudes requires an absolute calibration , which must be obtained independently of the results from the nn2 method .",
    "uncertainties in the individual subtractions were estimated by measuring the scatter in fake sne inserted at locations having a surface brightness similar to that at .",
    "early - time nir observations of  ( defined here as those made before  passed behind the sun during 2007 ) show a remarkably flat light curve , as seen in figure  [ early - lc ] . to transform the relative flux differences from the nn2 method to an absolute scale",
    ", we subtracted the archival two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) image from each of the images obtained on 2006 nov . 13.24 , 14.25 , 15.38 , and 16.37 to determine the  magnitudes of the sn on these dates .",
    "the mean sn flux was then used to transform the relative flux from the nn2 method to the absolute flux of the 2mass system @xcite .",
    "pairitel uses the old 2mass camera and telescope ; hence , we do not expect any large systematic effects in the 2mass subtractions .",
    "the final calibrated  photometry is summarized in table  [ ptel - data ] .    on 2006 nov .",
    "01 , @xcite obtained palomar hale ( 5  m ) ao images in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands , clearly resolving  from the host - galaxy nucleus , and measured its flux . in the @xmath21 band our calibration and the @xcite measurement",
    "agree to within 1@xmath22 , while the agreement in the @xmath20 band is somewhat worse ( @xmath32@xmath22 ) .",
    "@xcite had only a single 2mass star within the field of view of their ao images , whereas @xmath0100 2mass stars were used to calibrate the pairitel images ; when coupled with the difficulty associated with photometry of ao images , this may explain the differences between the two measurements .",
    "we note that were we to adopt the @xcite measurements as our calibration , there would be an overall systematic shift of our @xmath20 and @xmath21 light curves to brighter values , which in turn would lead to worse agreement between the nir data and early - time optical spectra ( see figure  [ early - sed ] ) .",
    "this suggests that our calibration method is sufficient .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in our photometry are dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration , which is @xmath30.03 mag in @xmath20 , @xmath30.06 mag in @xmath23 , and @xmath30.04 mag in @xmath21 .",
    "this uncertainty is the same for all epochs , so a change in the calibration would lead to a systematic shift of the entire light curve .",

    "the most likely explanation for this large luminosity in the nir is warm dust .",

    "this scenario would have required the production of @xmath5 10  @xmath4ni , which in turn would produce a large late - time luminosity that decays at the rate of @xmath4co .",
    "the late - time nir luminosity is not accounted for in either the general pair - instability models or the artificial model of @xcite ; it therefore provides a serious challenge to the pair - instability sn hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that the dust existed prior to the sn explosion , at large distances from the explosion site , and was heated via collisions with the expanding material in the expanding blast wave .",
    "the intense ultraviolet / optical output from a sn at its peak vaporizes any dust in the vicinity of the sn @xcite .",
    "this radiation near peak creates a dust - free cavity into which the sn ejecta may expand at early times ; however , the ejecta blast wave will eventually reach the edge of the dust - free cavity , at which point collisional excitations may generate nir emission .",

    "based on the observed width of the h@xmath10 line from , @xcite estimate the speed of the blast wave to be 4000 km s@xmath9 , which would mean that this material would take @xmath370 yr to reach the edge of the dust - free cavity .",
    "even if there are ejecta traveling at more typical sn velocities of 10,000 km s@xmath9 , it would take over 28 yr for this material to reach the edge of the dust - free cavity .",
    "given that the nir excess is present @xmath31 yr following explosion , and that the sn ejecta could not reach the dust in such a short time , collisional heating of dust by sn ejecta can not explain the observed nir excess .",
    "the emission features that arise in sne  iin , as in , originate from the interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense csm .",
    "shocked gas , located between the forward shock which is plowing into the csm and a reverse shock of the sn ejecta , can cool , and if the density is large enough , it may form new dust grains .",
    "the cooling time for such dust is short ( @xmath310100 s ) , but a persistent heat source can generate an extended period of nir emission . the physical conditions for post - shock dust formation are not necessarily easy to produce : strongly interacting sne are often x - ray sources , which could prevent the formation of new dust grains in the post - shock gas . in a few cases ,",
    "however , evidence for the formation of dust in the post - shock region has been found for sne 1998s @xcite , 2006jc @xcite , and 2005ip @xcite , and possibly also sn 2006tf @xcite .",
    "this newly formed dust is then heated by the energy from the shock as it continues to propagate into the csm , which gives rise to the prolonged nir excess .",
    "this scenario is difficult to reconcile with the case of sn 2006gy , however .",
    "spectra taken around day 200 show a decline in the luminosity of the h@xmath10 emission line , which indicates a reduction in the csm interaction at this time @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as detailed by @xcite , the lack of x - ray , h@xmath10 , and radio emission a little more than a year after the sn explosion implies that the observed nir luminosity can not be explained by shock - heated dust .",
    "in fact , the radio nondetection of   continues through day 648 @xcite .",
    "@xcite do claim the detection of very weak h@xmath10 emission from  on day 394 , but the inferred luminosity of @xmath310@xmath58 erg s@xmath9 is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the observed nir luminosity at this time .",
    "@xcite also claim an @xmath38-band detection of 19.4 mag on day 394 ( though we note that @xcite report an upper limit of @xmath59 20 mag , and @xcite give an upper limit of @xmath59 20.3 mag , at a similar epoch ) , which would constitute an optical luminosity similar to that observed in the nir .",
    "the source of this optical luminosity could potentially be the heat source for newly formed dust at day @xmath3400 , though it can not explain the similar nir luminosity seen on day 736 . while  was detected in the optical at @xmath0 800 day to have a luminosity similar to that seen in the nir , the very blue nature of optical data suggest that it is a scattered light echo ( see below ) of uv / optical emission from the sn peak .",
    "the light echo must originate _ outside _ the dust - forming region and therefore can not heat the dust . while we can not strongly rule out dust formation in the post - shock region of it is implausible to explain the late - time nir luminosity via new dust , because there are no signs of a heating source that lasts for @xmath0 1 yr .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation for the late - time nir excess is a dust - heated echo , as first discussed by @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behavior of ir echoes predicted by @xcite provides an excellent match to the observed behavior of .",
    "the ir emission comes from dust near the explosion site which is heated by the early - time uv / optical emission from the sn .",
    "the model predicts a fast rise in the ir , followed by an extended plateau ( see below ) before the ir luminosity follows a rapid decline",
    ".  exhibits a very slow decline in the nir , only a factor of @xmath32 in flux over the course of @xmath31 yr , consistent with being on the extended plateau phase as predicted by the model .",
    "the plateau occurs because the hottest dust , which exists right at the edge of the dust - free cavity described above , dominates the emission .",
    "according to the view of a distant observer , the emitting volume is a series of paraboloid light fronts that expand throughout the dust - free cavity ( see figure 1 of @xcite or figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "as a paraboloid expands it continually heats dust at @xmath48 , which is what gives rise to the plateau in the light curve . after a time @xmath32@xmath48/@xmath60",
    ", the vertex of a given paraboloid will reach the back edge of the cavity and will no longer be heating dust at @xmath61 .",
    "emission from the dust will be dominated by the uv / optical radiation produced by the sn at peak , and once this radiation sweeps past the back edge of the cavity the ir luminosity begins to rapidly decline .",
    "therefore , if we know the duration of the plateau phase we can determine the size of the dust - free cavity .",
    "constraints on the cavity size can be determined by assuming that the echo starts at our first @xmath27 observation on day 405 and ends on our last observation on day 736 . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath62 cm , however , it would be contrived if our observations were to perfectly bookend the plateau phase of the echo : the echo almost certainly started prior to day 405 and continued beyond day 736 . if we instead assume that the slight nir excess seen at day @xmath3100 ( see figure  [ early - lc ] ) is the rise of an ir echo , then we find that @xmath63 cm , which shows reasonable agreement with the value we calculated for the dust - free cavity in @xmath11 3.2.2 , @xmath55 cm , considering the uncertainties in the dust temperature and the likelihood that the plateau extends beyond day 736 .",
    "our nir observations are only sensitive to the warmest dust , but if we assume that the nir luminosity peaks in the @xmath27 band , then a lower limit to the total energy emitted in the ir is @xmath64  @xmath65 d , or @xmath5 4@xmath66 erg .",
    "this is comparable to the canonical optical output of a normal sn  ii .",
    "typically , this would pose a significant problem for the ir echo hypothesis as it would require order unity of the original optical radiation from the sn to be absorbed and re - radiated in the nir .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the argument used by @xcite to argue against the light - echo hypothesis for sn 2005ip . in the case of  this is not a problem , however , because the nir emission falls well within the available energy budget to heat the dust . after applying a bolometric correction , @xcite find that @xmath67 erg were emitted by  during the first @xmath3220 day of the light - curve evolution , which means that less than 2% of this energy has been absorbed and re - radiated by the dust .",
    "this value is comparable to those found by @xcite for sne 1979c and 1980k .",
    "if we assume that the dust radiates as a blackbody , we can estimate the optical depth of the dust shell as @xmath68 .",
    "we note that like @xmath69 above , this value constitutes a lower limit for @xmath70 .",
    "even if the nir luminosity is a factor of 10 larger than our lower limits , this would imply @xmath71 , which corresponds to an optical extinction of @xmath72 .",
    "this is far less than the total observed extinction from the host , @xmath73 @xcite , suggesting that the dusty shell responsible for the ir echo can not produce all of the non - galactic reddening observed toward . that there is a considerable amount of dust along the line of sight , which is not in the csm of ,",
    "should not come as a surprise given that there is a prominent dust lane in ngc 1260 ( see figure  [ false - color ] ) .    with this information in hand , it is now possible to estimate the total dust mass of the shell that creates the nir echo ; according to @xcite , it is simply related to the dust properties , the optical depth of the dust , and the inner and outer radii of the shell . above we estimate the inner radius of the dust shell to be @xmath38@xmath74 cm .",
    "the value of the outer radius can be deciphered from the decay of the nir light curve following the plateau .",
    "as we have not yet observed the nir decay , we adopt an outer radius of 2@xmath48 , which _ minimizes _ the dust mass in the shell . finally , we follow the same assumptions as @xcite about the dust properties : a grain density @xmath75 = 3 g @xmath76 , grain radius @xmath77 m , and mean absorption efficiency @xmath49 = 1 . with these asumptions",
    "we find a total dust mass of @xmath78 . assuming a typical value for the dust - to - gas ratio , 1:100",
    ", the total mass of the circumstellar shell is @xmath310 .",
    "this value shows good agreement with the initial estimate of 510  from @xcite , which was based on only observations taken between 400 and 465 day after explosion .",
    "we note that @xmath310  constitutes a lower limit to the total mass of the shell , because the actual value of the duration of the plateau and @xmath69 could potentially be much larger than the values we adopted above .    at a distance of @xmath310@xmath6 cm from the sn explosion site ,",
    "it is not immediately evident that the dust giving rise to the nir echo is part of the progenitor s csm or the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the large dust mass needed at @xmath310@xmath6 cm could be explained if the progenitor passed through a phase of eruptive mass loss @xmath310001500 yr prior to explosion , in an event similar to observed outbursts from @xmath79 car .",
    "pre - existing dust in the walls of a giant hii region , where a massive star like sn2006gy s progenitor might have lived , can not account for the ir echo because at typical distances of @xmath310 pc or more from the sn , the dust would be far too cold to reproduce the nir excess .",
    "@xcite predicts that any sn with an ir echo due to pre - existing csm dust should also show a faint scattered light echo in the optical as well .",
    "he shows that this dust can lead to optical emission characterized by a @xmath80 scattering law , where @xmath10 is some value between 1 and 2 .",
    "more than a year after explosion  had faded rapidly in the optical @xcite .",
    "therefore , we obtained _ hst _ images to search for a possible late - time scattered light echo .",
    "our optical detection on day 825 shows a significant change in the optical decline rate of . between day 200400 the sn faded by @xmath5 3 mag in the optical @xcite , whereas the decline between day 400825 was only @xmath31 mag .",
    "in addition to this reduced rate of decline , the sn underwent significant color evolution . assuming that @xmath32 and @xmath34 approximate the @xmath81 and @xmath82 bands , respectively",
    ", we find that @xmath83 mag on day 825 .",
    "by contrast , with a 12000 k color temperature at peak @xcite , the observe color of  would have been @xmath84 mag .",
    "thus , the spectrum on day 825 is _ bluer _ than the spectrum at peak .",
    "indeed , the @xmath30.4 mag color change shows excellent agreement with a @xmath85 scattering law .",
    "a @xmath57 scattering law , on the other hand , would predict a @xmath86 mag change to the @xmath87 color , or roughly @xmath88 mag during the late - time epochs .",
    "this behavior is similar to what one would expect from a scattered light echo : as in the case of an ir echo , when successive paraboloids sweep out to progressively larger radii , dust in the circumstellar ( or in some cases the interstellar ) environment can scatter that light toward the observer , creating a plateau in the optical light curve of the sn . at the same time , scattering preferentially selects shorter wavelengths , which results in a spectrum that is bluer than that of the sn at peak .",
    "this is the precise behavior observed for the type ia sne 1991 t @xcite , 1998bu @xcite , and 2006x @xcite which both showed significant departures from the expected decline rate of type a sne . spectra taken roughly two years after maximum , for sne 1991 t and 1998bu , and @xmath310 months after maximum for sn 2006x , show emission features similar to those seen in the spectra near peak superposed on top of a blue continuum for both these sne .",
    "light echoes have also been observed around a number of core - collapse sne , e.g. sn 2003gd @xcite and sn 1993j @xcite , though we note that late - time spectra of the light echoes do not exist in these cases .    in figure  [",

    "we note that the early - time spectra of  show considerable line blanketing blueward of @xmath34000  , such that the emission decreases blueward of our @xmath31 detection .",
    "the nir emission rapidly rises toward the ir , suggesting that there is considerable ir emission to which our nir measurements are not sensitive .",

    "note that no correction for reddening has been made .",
    "the photometry shows excellent agreement with a @xmath80 scattering law , where @xmath90 .",
    "the lack of an actual reflection spectrum precludes a more detailed model of the scattering dust at this time .",
    "given that the other typical scenarios for a large late - time luminosity from a sn , @xmath4co decay and extended csm interaction , have been ruled out , we conclude that the late - time _ hst _",
    "detection is a scattered light echo .",
    "the location of the scattering dust is of interest as it can help determine properties of the environment local to . above",
    "we show that the csm dust responsible for the nir echo can not account for all the reddening observed toward , suggesting that the sn light passes through external , non - csm dusty regions in the host galaxy prior to reaching us . therefore , the scattered light echo could originate in a number of different locations .    with only a single epoch of the unresolved scattered light echo",
    ", a precise determination of the location of the scattering dust can not be obtained .",
    "nevertheless , we can gain some insight into the dust location based on the total optical and nir emission .",
    "for the case where the nir - echo dust also gives rise to the scattered light echo , and assuming the sn can be modeled as a single short pulse of uv / optical radiation , the ratio of the scattered light luminosity ( @xmath91 ) to the ir luminosity at late - times can be shown to be @xcite :    @xmath92^{1/2}}-\\frac{(1-g)^2+gct / r_2}{[(1-g)^2 + 2gct / r_2]^{1/2}}\\right\\ } \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 is the dust albedo , @xmath60 is the speed of light , @xmath94 is the time since the sn explosion , @xmath95 is outer radius of the dust shell , and @xmath96 is a measure of the degree of forward scattering .",
    "the case @xmath96 = 0 corresponds to isotropic scattering and @xmath96 = 1 is completely forward scattering .",
    "note that in equation  [ eqn2 ] we have assumed that @xmath97 , where @xmath48 is the inner radius of the dust shell , and that the albedo is independent of frequency .",
    "empirical estimates and numerical calculations @xcite show @xmath98 0.6 . for the dust albedo",
    "we adopt @xmath99 0.6 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we can not constrain @xmath95 with our current observations , but we do know that @xmath95 must be greater than @xmath48 , and the value of equation  [ eqn2 ] does not change when @xmath100 . for reasonable limits to the outer radius , @xmath101 , we find that @xmath1020.60 .    direct integration of the _ hst _ optical flux yields an optical luminosity of @xmath3(7.4@xmath250.5)@xmath103 .",
    "this value is somewhat uncertain because our data do not extend into the ultraviolet ; however , optical spectra taken near peak show that line blanketing severely reduces the flux blueward of @xmath34000    @xcite , so this uncertainty should not have a significant effect on the total scattered light luminosity .",
    "if we assume that the nir flux continues to decline at the same rate as that observed between day 405 and 736 , then we find a lower limit to the ir luminosity ( again because our nir observations only probe emission from the hottest dust ) of @xmath104  on day 825 .",
    "therefore , on day 825 , @xmath105 , consistent with the predicted values above in the case where the scattering dust is the same dust responsible for the ir echo .",
    "the alternative possibility is that the scattering dust is not located in the csm , instead existing at some other location in ngc 1260 along the line of sight .",

    "our observations appear to be consistent with one of two scenarios : either ( i ) the scattered light echo is due to csm dust , which has also been heated and is radiating in the ir , or ( ii ) a dusty region @xmath320 pc from the sn is responsible for the late - time optical luminosity .",
    "this latter scenario seems very plausible if the progenitor of  was a very massive star , @xmath5 100 @xcite .",
    "if this were the case we might expect that the progenitor resides in the center of a giant hii region with multiple dense , dusty clouds nearby .",
    "this scenario might be very similar to the carina nebula surrounding @xmath79 car , which has multiple dusty molecular clouds only 1020 pc from @xmath79 car ( e.g. @xcite ) . perhaps given a similar progenitor birth environment , evidence for patchy dust at the tens of pc scale around grb environments also appears to be secure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the sn has been localized well outside the central kpc of the host galaxy , with the exception of sn 2008es , for which a definitive host has not yet been identified @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the location of  was not in fact special .",
    "current and future surveys will dramatically increase the rate of discovery of vlsne , which should , in turn , allow for a more systematic study of their host environments ( for a discussion of the rates of vlsne see @xcite ) .",
    "given our interpretation for the late - time optical and nir emission arising from a dust shell at @xmath38@xmath74 cm from the sn , what might we expect from future observations of ? the ir - echo models of @xcite show that after a time @xmath121 , the ir luminosity falls off the plateau and exhibits significant decline . based on our predicted value for the size of the dust - free cavity ( see @xmath113.2.2 )",
    ", we would expect that the plateau phase of the ir echo has ended , and that the ir flux is now in steady decline .",
    "future observations of this decline will place limits on the outer extent of the dust shell , which will in turn provide better limits on the total mass of the dust shell .",
    "our ability to predict the behavior of the scattered light echo is limited by the current degeneracy concerning the physical location of the scattering dust .",
    "if the same dust is responsible for both the ir and scattered light echoes , then we would expect that the optical emission is now fading , in a manner similar to what ought to be seen in the nir .",
    "our observations are also consistent with dust located at @xmath320 pc from the sn , in which case we might expect the scattered light echo to continue at roughly a constant flux for several more years . continued observations with _ hst",
    "_ would allow us to distinguish between these two situations",
    ".    the shell - shock model of @xcite may also explain the peak luminosity of several other vlsne : 2005ap , 2006tf , 2008es @xcite .",
    "this model requires large csm densities at a distance of a few @xmath122 cm , which can be accomplished if the sn progenitor undergoes significant ( @xmath30.11   yr@xmath9 ) mass loss during the few decades prior to explosion @xcite .",
    "the most luminous lbvs have observed mass shells with @xmath510  ( @xcite and references therein ) , indicative of giant eruptions @xcite but not lbvs in their more typical state with less violent wind variability ( see @xcite for a general reference on lbv winds ) . the possible connection between large csm densities and vlsne may suggest that their progenitors are lbvs @xcite . for the case of , @xcite argue that the dusty shell at @xmath310@xmath6 cm could exist if the progenitor underwent an lbv - like eruptive mass - loss phase @xmath31200 yr prior to the sn .",
    "ir echoes for other vlsne have not been reported to date , but we strongly encourage a search for them . if a substantial fraction of them exhibit late - time characteristics similar to , this may be suggestive of a common timescale , @xmath31000 years and @xmath310 years , for extreme mass loss in the progenitors of vlsne . the combination of a vlsne and ir echo would point to multiple phases of eruptive mass loss , which is reminiscent of lbv behavior .",
    "the instability driving these eruptions still remains unclear ( one possibility is the pulsation pair - instability described by @xcite to explain ) , and we encourage future observational and theoretical work to better characterize these systems .",
