    "the phenomenon of quantum entanglement @xcite is central to the development and understanding of quantum information theory and computation @xcite . for a general bipartite mixed quantum state it",
    "is not known how to determine in an efficient way whether the state is entangled or separable .",
    "an experimental setup usually involves mixed quantum states , and the need to control , manipulate and quantify entanglement in such states is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "the characterization of entangled states of a quantum system composed of two subsystems thus remains one of the key unsolved problems in the theory of quantum information .",
    "we will consider here only the finite dimensional case .",
    "entanglement of a quantum state may be revealed experimentally through negative expectation values of certain observables , called entanglement witnesses , that have positive expectation values in all separable states  @xcite .",
    "jamiokowski isomorphism relates the entanglement witnesses to positive maps on matrix algebras  @xcite . in this way",
    "the study of entanglement witnesses is closely related to the study of positive maps .",
    "this study was pioneered by strmer  @xcite , who has recently given an extensive review  @xcite .    in order to investigate the separability problem using positive maps we need to understand the structure of the set of positive maps .",
    "unfortunately , this is a problem which seems just as difficult as the original separability problem .",
    "since the set of positive maps is a compact convex set , a classification of the extremal positive maps would entail a classification of all positive maps .",
    "this is our motivation for studying the extremal positive maps .",
    "the contents of the paper are organized in the following manner .    in section 2",
    "we review some basic theory regarding positive maps and entanglement witnesses .",
    "we define the link between entanglement witnesses and positive maps , known as the choi  jamiokowski isomorphism .",
    "an important class of positive maps , the completely positive maps , is defined .",
    "these maps are quantum operations , since they map quantum states into quantum states . the important distinction between decomposable and non - decomposable maps",
    "is made , and the relation to the peres separability criterion  @xcite is shown . furthermore , the unital and trace preserving properties of positive maps are defined , and the relation between these two properties is established .",
    "these two concepts are further discussed in section  3 .",
    "finally , the expectation values of entanglement witnesses in pure product states are introduced .",
    "these are positive semidefinite biquadratic forms , the zeros of which play an important role .",
    "the importance of the zeros for the understanding of the extremal entanglement witnesses and the corresponding extremal positive maps is outlined .    in section 3",
    "we argue that any entanglement witness may be transformed into a unital and trace preserving form through a product transformation .",
    "we use the fact that a map is trace preserving if and only if the transposed map is unital to define conditions on this product transformation .",
    "we then suggest an iteration scheme to solve the resulting equations , and we define and investigate the conditions under which this iteration scheme will converge .",
    "finally , in section  4 we use the unital and trace preserving form of a generic extremal entanglement witness in the @xmath0 system that we have produced numerically  @xcite , to create various plots showing how the corresponding positive map acts .",
    "we present similar plots illustrating the action of the choi ",
    "lam extremal positive map .",
    "we also discuss briefly an example of extremal witnesses in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we introduce our notation and review some mathematical background .",
    "we write @xmath3 for the set of hermitian @xmath4 matrices , which is a real hilbert space with the natural scalar product @xmath5    the mathematical description of a finite dimensional composite quantum system involves the complex tensor product @xmath6 and the real tensor product @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "we write the components of @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 the matrix elements of an @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 are @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a product vector @xmath17 has components @xmath18 , and a product matrix @xmath19 has components @xmath20 .",
    "we define the partial transpose @xmath21 as the transpose with respect to the second factor in the tensor product , @xmath22 we use _ density matrices _ , positive matrices of unit trace , to represent physical states of the most general kind , so called mixed states .",
    "the set of all @xmath12 density matrices we call @xmath23 , or @xmath24 if we need not specify the dimension .",
    "it is a compact convex set of dimension @xmath25 , completely determined by its extremal points , which are the pure states @xmath26 with @xmath9 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the partial transpose @xmath27 of a density matrix @xmath28 need not be positive definite . a density matrix with a positive partial transpose",
    "is called a ppt state , thus we define the set of ppt states as @xmath29 .",
    "a density matrix @xmath30 lies on the boundary @xmath31 if it has rank @xmath32 .",
    "then it lies in the interior of a face @xmath33 , which is the set of density matrices on a @xmath34 dimensional subspace @xmath35 .",
    "every face of @xmath36 is of the type @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath31 consists of faces arranged in the same hierarchical structure as the lattice of subspaces of @xmath37 .",
    "a @xmath38 density matrix has the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 real and @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath42 is a three dimensional sphere , the bloch sphere .",
    "the boundary states , with @xmath43 , are the pure states .",
    "the set @xmath44 of @xmath0 density matrices has dimension eight .",
    "its boundary @xmath45 consists of a seven dimensional set of rank two matrices , and a four dimensional set of rank one matrices , the pure states .",
    "every rank two state in @xmath44 lies in the interior of a bloch sphere @xmath46 .",
    "a density matrix @xmath30 is _ separable _ if it is of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "its partial transpose is then positive .",
    "this fact , that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of separable states , provides an easy test for separability , known as the peres criterion  @xcite .",
    "a density matrix is _ entangled _ if it is not separable .",
    "the separability problem , how to decide whether a given density matrix is separable or entangled , is difficult because it is difficult to recognize the entangled ppt states .",
    "we define the dual set @xmath54 the dual of @xmath55 is @xmath56 , thus @xmath28 is separable if and only if @xmath57 for every @xmath58 . for this reason we call a matrix @xmath58 an _",
    "entanglement witness_. note that we do not impose here the usual condition on an entanglement witness @xmath13 that it should have at least one negative eigenvalue , so that @xmath59 for some @xmath30 .",
    "the convex set @xmath56 is completely determined by its extremal points , which are the pure product states @xmath60 with @xmath17 and @xmath61 , for which @xmath62 thus @xmath58 if and only if the biquadratic form @xmath63 is non - negative definite .",
    "since @xmath64 we see that @xmath65 if and only if @xmath58 .",
    "a _ map _ , in the terminology used here , is a linear transformation @xmath66 such that @xmath67 when @xmath68 the complex matrix elements @xmath69 defining the map satisfy the relations @xmath70 , so that the map preserves hermiticity .",
    "the relation @xmath71 defines a one to one correspondence between a hermitian matrix @xmath72 and a map @xmath73 .",
    "as we define the correspondence here it differs slightly from the well known choi ",
    "jamiokowski isomorphism , which associates the matrix @xmath13 with the map @xmath74 .",
    "it is useful to introduce matrices @xmath75 and @xmath76 that are basis vectors in the two hilbert spaces .",
    "then the map @xmath77 is given by real matrix elements @xmath78 such that @xmath79 we will choose the basis vectors to be orthonormal , then the matrix elements are @xmath80 furthermore , we will choose the unit matrices as basis vectors , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "then the matrices @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 are traceless .",
    "the transposed map @xmath87 may be defined in a basis independent way by the condition that @xmath88 it has matrix elements @xmath89 , or @xmath90 .",
    "thus transposition of the map @xmath91 corresponds to transposition of the real matrix @xmath92 and hermitian conjugation of the complex matrix @xmath69 .",
    "as defined here , the maps @xmath93 and @xmath94 act on @xmath95 and @xmath96 as follows , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the partial traces .",
    "the matrix @xmath13 may be expanded in terms of the basis vectors @xmath100 as @xmath101      by definition , a _ positive _ map @xmath66 transforms positive matrices into positive matrices , that is , if @xmath102 then @xmath103 .    in terms of the map @xmath104",
    "the biquadratic form introduced in equation   may be written as @xmath105 the condition that @xmath106 for all @xmath107 , @xmath108 means that @xmath109 is a positive matrix for every @xmath107 . since the pure states @xmath110 are all the extremal points of @xmath111 , this is another way of saying that @xmath104 is a positive map .",
    "we conclude that @xmath13 is an entanglement witness if and only if @xmath104 is a positive map .",
    "an equivalent condition is that @xmath112 is a positive map .",
    "this correspondence between entanglement witnesses and positive maps places the positive maps in a central position in the theory of quantum entanglement .      an obvious condition on a physical map @xmath113 , transforming physical states into physical states , is that it should be positive .",
    "a less obvious condition is that it should be _ completely positive _ , so that every map of the form @xmath114 is positive , where @xmath115 is the identity map .",
    "the most general form of a completely positive map is @xmath116 with @xmath117 matrices @xmath118 .",
    "this form gives the following matrix elements of @xmath13 , @xmath119 we see that the map @xmath104 is completely positive if and only if @xmath21 is positive .",
    "it is well known that @xmath21 may be positive without @xmath13 being positive , because the transposition map @xmath120 on @xmath121 is positive but not completely positive .",
    "a separable state @xmath28 , as defined in equation  , remains positive under the application of positive maps to its local parts , thus @xmath122 is a positive matrix when @xmath123 and @xmath124 are positive maps . in this way",
    "positive maps give necessary conditions for separability .",
    "positive maps can also give sufficient conditions for separability  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the correspondence described above between entanglement witnesses and positive maps . for @xmath125",
    "let us define @xmath126 as @xmath127 where @xmath13 is an entanglement witness and @xmath128 the corresponding positive map .",
    "in index notation we have that @xmath129 clearly @xmath130 is positive if @xmath28 is separable . the other way around , if @xmath130 is positive for every entanglement witness @xmath13 we have that @xmath131 for every @xmath13 , implying that @xmath28 is separable .",
    "note that this proof of sufficiency does not use the full condition that @xmath130 should be positive , it uses only the condition that @xmath130 should have a non - negative expectation value in the maximally entangled pure state ( bell state ) @xmath132 .",
    "if we use the full positivity condition , one single positive map can in principle reveal the entanglement of many different states for which we would need many different entanglement witnesses . the ppt condition associated with the transposition map is a striking example , it is equivalent to all the conditions provided by a much larger set of entanglement witnesses .",
    "the basic reason for the efficiency of maps in revealing entanglement is nonlinearity : the separability condition that a product @xmath133 of positive maps should map @xmath28 into a positive matrix is highly nonlinear in @xmath28 .",
    "an entanglement witness @xmath13 , on the other hand , gives an inequality @xmath57 linear in @xmath28 .",
    "a positive map @xmath134 is said to be _",
    "decomposable _ if it can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are completely positive , and @xmath138 is transposition on @xmath139  @xcite . since @xmath140 it follows that @xmath93 is decomposable if and",
    "only if @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are both positive matrices .",
    "this decomposition of @xmath13 implies for every ppt state @xmath28 that @xmath144 in particular , @xmath13 is an entanglement witness , and we call it a decomposable witness .",
    "it is not very useful as a witness , however , since it can not reveal the entanglement of an entangled ppt state .",
    "it was shown by woronowicz that all positive maps @xmath134 with @xmath145 are decomposable  @xcite . in these dimensions entangled ppt states therefore do not exist , and the peres criterion is both necessary and sufficient for separability .",
    "by virtue of the peres criterion , the development of practically useful separability criteria in dimensions @xmath146 is a problem closely related to the understanding of the nondecomposable positive maps .",
    "a map @xmath147 is _ unital _ if it maps the identity @xmath148 to the identity @xmath149 , that is , if @xmath150 it is _ trace preserving _ if @xmath151 for all @xmath95 , that is , if @xmath152 which means that @xmath153 thus the map @xmath154 is trace preserving if and only if @xmath155 is unital .",
    "a physical map should conserve probability , which means that it should be trace preserving . in terms of the corresponding matrix @xmath72 the condition for @xmath104 to be unital",
    "is that @xmath156 and the condition for @xmath104 to be trace preserving is that @xmath157 equation   implies that @xmath158 , whereas equation   implies that @xmath159 .",
    "thus the map may be both unital and trace preserving only if @xmath160 . if @xmath161 the proper condition is rather that @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "since we regard normalization constants as unimportant we will abuse the language and call the map unital and trace preserving if equation   holds , even when @xmath161 .    in terms of the matrix elements",
    "@xmath165 the condition for unitality is that @xmath166 , and the condition for trace preservation is that @xmath167 .",
    "this means that a unital and trace preserving map @xmath104 is generated by an entanglement witness of the form @xmath168      since the conditions defining @xmath72 as an entanglement witness are the infinite set of inequalities @xmath169 it is clear that @xmath13 is a boundary point of @xmath55 if and only if at least one of these inequalities is an equality .",
    "we call the pure product state @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 a zero of @xmath13 if @xmath173 since a zero is a minimum of the non - negative function @xmath174 , it follows that the first derivative in every direction at the zero must also vanish .",
    "these conditions amount to a set of equalities @xmath175 these equations may be regarded as linear constraints on the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "it should be remembered that each equation is complex and is equivalent to two real equations , except that equation   is real .",
    "a careful counting shows that one zero implies @xmath176 real valued constraints on @xmath13 .",
    "if the second derivative in every direction is strictly positive , then the zero @xmath177 is a quadratic minimum , and there are no more constraints on @xmath13 from this zero . if the second derivative in some direction vanishes , then the third derivative in this direction must also vanish , and the zero is a quartic minimum .",
    "this imposes further constraints on @xmath13 , which we do not detail here .",
    "the distinction between quadratic and quartic zeros is important . obviously , the quadratic zeros are isolated points . a quartic zero may be an isolated point , but it may also belong to a continuous set of zeros .    an entanglement witness @xmath13 is extremal if and only if it has so many zeros that all the constraints from all the zeros together determine @xmath13 uniquely up to a proportionality constant",
    ".      an extremal entanglement witness @xmath13 is understood in terms of its zeros .",
    "it corresponds to an extremal positive map @xmath104 , and we have to understand what the zeros of the witness imply for the corresponding map .",
    "let @xmath177 be an isolated zero of @xmath13 , and define @xmath178 , @xmath179 .",
    "we use the identities @xmath180 since @xmath181 and @xmath182 are both positive matrices , it follows that @xmath183 we also know that @xmath181 and @xmath182 have no other zero vectors , otherwise the zero vectors would span subspaces of dimension two or higher , and the zero @xmath177 would not be isolated .",
    "hence @xmath181 has rank @xmath184 and @xmath182 has rank @xmath185 .    to summarize , when @xmath13 is an extremal entanglement witness the corresponding maps @xmath104 and @xmath112 are extremal positive maps .",
    "an isolated zero @xmath177 of @xmath13 defines a rank one state @xmath186 mapped by @xmath104 to a rank @xmath184 state in @xmath187 , and a rank one state @xmath188 mapped by @xmath112 to a rank @xmath185 state in @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the zero of @xmath13 defines a point on the boundary of @xmath111 which is mapped to a point on the boundary of @xmath187 , and a point on the boundary of @xmath187 which is mapped by the transposed map to a point on the boundary of @xmath111 .",
    "we understand that the map @xmath104 is extremal precisely because the image @xmath189 inside @xmath187 touches the boundary of @xmath187 in as many points as possible .",
    "the identity map @xmath190 and the transposition map @xmath191 are two examples of extremal positive maps .",
    "they have the special property that they are rank one preservers , mapping pure states to pure states .",
    "they are extremal precisely because they map the boundary of @xmath1 onto itself .",
    "they both preserve volume .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of @xmath192 are @xmath193 , because @xmath192 is its own inverse , @xmath194 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath195 be a unitary matrix and define @xmath196 .",
    "then @xmath197 and @xmath198 are both rank one preservers , and they are extremal because they map the boundary of @xmath1 onto itself .",
    "they also preserve volumes .",
    "these maps and the corresponding entanglement witnesses are fundamentally different from the generic extremal witnesses we find numerically , which have only quadratic zeros , so that the corresponding maps map only a finite number of points from the boundary of @xmath1 to the boundary , and map all other boundary points to the interior .",
    "an extremal map of this generic kind is contractive , it reduces volumes , since it maps @xmath1 to a subset of itself .",
    "we argue now that every positive map @xmath199 where @xmath13 is an entanglement witness may be transformed into a unital and trace preserving form through a product transformation of the form @xcite @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "furthermore , we present here an efficient iteration procedure for doing the transformation numerically .",
    "a product transformation of this kind preserves all the essential characteristics of @xmath13 . for instance , if @xmath13 is extremal in @xmath203 and non - decomposable , then so is @xmath204 , and a zero @xmath205 of @xmath13 corresponds to a zero @xmath206 of @xmath204 , where @xmath207    as we saw in section  [ sec : unitaltrprmaps ] the result to be proved is that every entanglement witness @xmath13 may be transformed to a form as given in equation  . in  @xcite it was proved that every strictly positive density matrix may be transformed to such a form .",
    "but the theorem is actually valid more generally than it is stated there , since the proof is valid for every entanglement witness having no zeros , in other words , every witness lying in the interior of @xmath203 . here",
    "we want to apply this type of transformation to extremal witnesses , which lie on the boundary @xmath208 and have a maximal number of zeros .",
    "what could in principle go wrong in the limit when the boundary is approached from the inside of @xmath203 is that the transformation could become singular , but we find in practice that no such problems arise .    in terms of the transformed map @xmath209 the conditions to be fulfilled",
    "are that @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "we will assume here that @xmath160 , otherwise the proper conditions would be that @xmath212 and @xmath213",
    ".    in index notation equation   reads as follows , @xmath214 according to equation   the transformation @xmath215 then reads as follows , @xmath216 or in the indexfree notation , @xmath217 similarly , the transformation @xmath218 reads @xmath219 or @xmath220 the conditions for @xmath221 to be unital and trace preserving are that @xmath222 thus the problem to be solved is to find @xmath195 and @xmath223 such that @xmath224      this problem can be solved in two steps .",
    "first we find positive hermitian matrices @xmath225 and @xmath226 solving the equations @xmath227 then we solve the equations @xmath228 for @xmath195 and @xmath223 .",
    "the general solutions are @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are arbitrary unitary matrices , and @xmath232 , @xmath233 are the uniquely defined positive hermitian square roots , which we compute for example by diagonalizing @xmath182 and @xmath181 and taking the square roots of the eigenvalues .",
    "equation   makes sense because the matrices @xmath225 and @xmath226 are strictly positive as long as @xmath195 and @xmath223 are nonsingular , and the maps @xmath234 and @xmath235 , as well as the inversions @xmath236 and @xmath237 , transform strictly positive matrices into strictly positive matrices .",
    "the method suggesting itself for solving equation   is simply to iterate the equations . given an approximate solution @xmath238 for @xmath182 we try to compute a better approximation @xmath239 by a series of four transformations , @xmath240 we start the iterations for example with @xmath241 .",
    "a sufficient condition for the convergence of @xmath238 to a unique limit @xmath182 is that each transformation @xmath242 is contractive ( except in the direction along @xmath182 ) .",
    "a small perturbation @xmath243 of @xmath238 transforms linearly as @xmath244 where the linear map @xmath245 is the derivative of the nonlinear transformation @xmath242 .",
    "the transformation is contractive if all eigenvalues of @xmath245 ( except the special eigenvalue which must be close to 1 ) are smaller than one in absolute value .",
    "now @xmath245 is a composition of four linear maps , @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are linearizations of the matrix inversions , @xmath249    the examples of extremal positive maps @xmath234 and @xmath235 that we have studied numerically are strongly contractive , and we find in practice that this is enough to ensure that @xmath245 is contractive , with eigenvalues typically no larger than about @xmath250 , even though @xmath247 and @xmath248 are not contractive .",
    "we have used this iteration scheme on a large number of numerically produced extremal entanglement witnesses @xcite , and also on many non - extremal witnesses constructed as convex combinations of the extremal ones .",
    "numerically our attempts , which are in the thousands , always converge , and it also appears that for a given witness @xmath13 the solution @xmath182 is unique , independent of the initial guess @xmath251 .",
    "we now specialize to the case @xmath252 .",
    "the set @xmath253 of normalized density matrices has dimension @xmath254 . when @xmath160 a linear positive map from @xmath139 to @xmath121 may be transformed to a form where it is unital and trace preserving .",
    "given a unital and trace preserving positive map @xmath255 .",
    "it maps @xmath1 into @xmath1 , and the maximally mixed state @xmath256 to itself .",
    "we plot two dimensional planar sections in order to illustrate how the image @xmath257 lies inside @xmath1 .",
    "we present such plots here for two different examples of extremal positive maps .",
    "the first example corresponds to a randomly chosen generic extremal witness found in a numerical search .",
    "such witnesses have only quadratic zeros .",
    "the second example is the choi",
