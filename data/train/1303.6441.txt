    "one of fundamental conclusions produced by ongoing studies of the dynamics of matter waves in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is that the effective local nonlinearity , induced by inter - atomic collisions , gives rise to robust bright solitons  and soliton complexes chap01:njp2003b , kono , fatk , torner , morsch , extra - reviews , boris .",
    "in addition to their fundamental significance , the solitons may be employed in applications . in particular , the use of solitons in matter - wave interferometers should help to dramatically increase the accuracy of these devices , see refs . @xcite-@xcite and a recent review  billam2 .    in the usual settings ,",
    "the existence of bright solitons requires the presence of the self - focusing nonlinearity .",
    "they may also be supported by nonlinear lattices , which feature alternation of spatial domains of self - focusing and defocusing , which give rise to the corresponding periodic _ pseudo - potential _ @xcite . on the other hand , self - defocusing nonlinearities , acting in the combination with periodic linear ( lattice ) potentials , support bright solitons of the bandgap type @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a common belief was that the self - defocusing per se could not give rise to bright solitons .",
    "the situation had changed when it was demonstrated that the repulsive cubic nonlinearity with the local strength growing with the distance from the center , @xmath0 , faster than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spatial dimension , can readily support stable solitons and solitary vortices @xcite . in the same works ,",
    "it was proposed how the corresponding profiles of the nonlinearity modulation can be created in bec and nonlinear optics . in particular , the spatial modulation of the scattering length of inter - atomic collisions , induced by spatially inhomogeneous magnetic or optical fields via the feshbach - resonance mechanism , can give rise to the required profile in bec .",
    "similarly , robust solitons and vortices were predicted in a more exotic model , with the constant strength of the defocusing nonlinearity but the diffraction coefficient decaying faster than @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to implement this new option for the creation of bright solitons by purely repulsive nonlinearity landscapes in other physical settings .",
    "for instance , it was recently demonstrated that the same mechanism works too in one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) media with the repulsive quintic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the present work aims to propose a way of creating bright solitons in fermi gases , with balanced spin - up and spin - down components .",
    "the possibility is to combine the spatial growth of the _ s_-wave scattering length , which accounts for the repulsion between the components , in one or two directions , and the harmonic - oscillator ( ho )  confining potential acting in the other directions .",
    "it should be noted that the dilute two - spin - component fermionic gases with the repulsive _",
    "s_-wave interaction do not feature phase coherence , as they are not superfluids @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their ground states can be accurately described by means of the density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the thomas - fermi - von weizscker ( tf - vw ) form of the density functional to predict density profiles and chemical potentials of the fermi droplets ( i.e. , bright solitons ) in two different configurations , which are considered in sections ii and iii , respectively : the quadratic growth of the scattering length in one direction ( @xmath4 ) and transverse ho confinement in the @xmath5 plane ; or the quadratic growth of the scattering length in the @xmath5 plane and ho confinement acting along @xmath4 . then",
    ", in sections iv  and v , following previous results obtained in the framework of the mean - field description of bec sala - mod , we , canary , we consider fermi gases without intrinsic interactions ( in particular , it may be a spin - polarized , i.e. , single - spin - component , gas ) and demonstrate that they give rise to localized ground states under the action of the 2d or 1d ho confinement , if its tightness , i.e. , the corresponding confinement frequency , grows in the transverse directions faster than @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the same confinements with the spatially growing tightness support , in a similar way , localized ground states in bec with the self - repulsive nonlinearity .",
    "in the presence of an external trapping potential @xmath8 , the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite ensures that the single - body local density @xmath9 of the ground state of a quantum system composed of interacting identical particles can be obtained by minimizing the energy functional , @xmath10=f[n]+\\int \\int \\int u_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x , y , z)\\ n(x , y , z)\\ dxdydz , \\label{eq : etf}\\]]where @xmath11 $ ] is an internal - energy functional , which is independent of @xmath8 . for the dilute normal fermi gas with two equally - populated spin states ,",
