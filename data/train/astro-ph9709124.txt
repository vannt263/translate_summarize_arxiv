    "systematic redshift surveys out to @xmath19 , and the discovery of lyman - limit galaxies at @xmath20 , have allowed considerable progress to be made in understanding the star - formation history of some bright , present - day galaxies , and suggest that global star - formation activity in our universe peaked at around @xmath21 ( e.g.  lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; pei & fall 1995 ; madau et al .",
    "1996 ; though see smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) .",
    "however , these same optical surveys appear to confirm that the properties of massive elliptical galaxies are little changed by @xmath19 , consistent with the picture that most of the stars in massive ellipticals were formed in a relatively short - lived , intense starburst at high redshift ( e.g.dunlop et al .  1996 ) .",
    "if , as has been suggested by a number of authors ( e.g.  zepf & silk 1996 ) , this initial starburst is biased towards the formation of significant quantities of _ high - mass _ stars ( and hence dust ) then a massive elliptical in the throes of formation would be expected to emit copious quantities of far - ir radiation . when viewed at high redshift , such an object",
    "would therefore be expected to be a strong sub - mm source .",
    "consequently it has long been anticipated that the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies will be one of the key cosmological issues which can be best addressed through the introduction of deep sub - mm imaging .    despite the success of the optical surveys described above in sampling the universe out to @xmath20 , and the exciting potential of deep sub - mm surveys to probe the high - redshift universe , the study of radio galaxies remains arguably the best method by which to trace the cosmological evolution of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is because selection on the basis of strong _ extended _ radio emission guarantees : ( i ) that the host galaxy is a giant elliptical or the progenitor thereof ( matthews , morgan & schmidt 1964 ; lilly & longair 1984 ) , a key advantage over optical / ir surveys where one is forced to resort to circumstantial evidence , such as comoving number densities , to help make an educated guess as to the most appropriate low - redshift counterpart for a given high - redshift source ; ( ii ) highly efficient selection of high - redshift galaxies , the properties of which should _ not _ be significantly biased by gravitational lensing ( in contrast , for example , to optically selected quasars which are selected primarily on the basis of their strong , _ compact _ emission ) .",
    "these considerations suggest that steep - spectrum radio galaxies are currently the targets of choice to trace the cosmological evolution of dust and gas ( and hence star - formation activity ) in massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "furthermore , such reasoning has already received a considerable observational boost as a result of the successful mm / sub - mm detections of first 4c41.17 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1994 ; chini & krgel 1994 ) and then 8c1435@xmath16635 ( ivison 1995 ) .",
    "the most useful physical parameter which can be extracted from such observations is the _ mass _ of dust , and hence the amount of gas which remains to be converted into stars at the epoch of observation .",
    "however , as discussed in detail by hughes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , to obtain a reliable estimate of the dust and gas masses in high - redshift objects requires that the uncertainty in dust temperature be minimized through obtaining mm  far - ir measurements which extend to significantly shorter wavelengths than the rayleigh - jeans tail , preferably straddling the rest - frame far - ir emission peak .",
    "furthermore , it is helpful ( through observations of co lines ) to confirm that gas / dust ratios in such high - redshift sources are at least consistent with those seen in low - redshift galaxies , before daring to extrapolate from the dust mass to the total mass of gas available for future star formation .    in this paper",
    "we address both these issues through a concerted programme of new mm / sub - mm / far - ir observations of the @xmath22 radio galaxy , 8c1435@xmath16635 .",
    "such a programme has only been made possible through the advent of new , highly sensitive facilities , in particular the newly - commissioned sub - mm bolometer array , scuba , on the jcmt , and the pht far - ir camera aboard _ iso_. together these facilities offer the opportunity of moving mm / far - ir studies of high - redshift objects from the pioneering world of bare detections to the reliable extraction of meaningful physical parameters .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "first we describe our existing and new mm @xmath23 far - ir measurements of 8c1435 + 635 , which prove beyond doubt that the far - ir emission from this galaxy is produced by dust .",
    "next , we use these data to derive new constraints on the dust and inferred gas mass in this galaxy .",
    "we then discuss the implications of our results for the evolutionary status of 8c1435@xmath16635 , compare its properties with those of 4c41.17 , and conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of this work for the evolution and formation of massive ellipticals in general . unless otherwise stated we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25kms@xmath26mpc@xmath26 throughout ; the impact on our conclusions of adopting a lower value for @xmath27 is specifically addressed in  4 .",
    "the existence of a large mass of dust in 8c1435 + 635 was first inferred as a result of its detection at @xmath28@xmath3 m ( @xmath29mjy ) by ivison ( 1995 ) . at the time of this observation ,",
    "8c1435 + 635 ( 4c63.20 ) was the most distant known radio galaxy , with a redshift @xmath22 corresponding to a look - back time of around 92 per cent of the age of the universe .",
    "its prodigious radio luminosity ( @xmath30whz@xmath26sr@xmath26 , lacy et al .",
    "1994 ) allied with a surprisingly weak lyman @xmath31 line ( @xmath32w , spinrad , dey and graham 1995 ) , made 8c1435 + 635 a natural target for observers in the sub - mm / mm regime where reservoirs of dusty , molecular gas betraying the galaxy s initial , brief burst of star formation might be seen .    a further attraction of this source as a potential target for mm / sub - mm observations arises from the fact that , like 4c41.17 ( dunlop et al .  1994 ) , 8c1435 + 635 is an ultra - steep spectrum ( uss ) radio source , in which extrapolation of its radio spectrum leads to an expected synchrotron contribution of less than 0.01mjy at @xmath33 mm .",
    "for this reason , the 1250-@xmath3 m emission observed by ivison ( 1995 ) was difficult to explain as arising from anything other than thermal radiation from dust .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth re - emphasizing that this one data - point was insufficient to conclusively exclude some previously undetected high - frequency synchrotron component from being responsible for the rest - frame far - ir emission .",

( 1997 ) have shown that the uncertainties in calculating the mass of dust responsible for the thermal , sub - mm emission in high - redshift radio galaxies are : ( i ) our limited knowledge of the rest - frame mass absorption coefficient , @xmath80 , and its dependence on frequency ; ( ii ) the dust temperature , @xmath81 , which has rarely been constrained to better than @xmath82k for any high - redshift system , even assuming optically thin dust , and , finally , ( iii ) the elusive values of @xmath83 and @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , these problems are sometimes coupled .",
    "for example , hughes et al .",
    "( 1993 ) noted that there is a trade off between @xmath81 and the critical frequency at which the dust becomes optically thick  models with dust that becomes optically thick in the far - ir can support higher temperatures than models with dust which remains optically thin into the mid- or near - ir regimes .",

    ", we adopt an average value of @xmath84m@xmath60kg@xmath26 for @xmath80 at 800@xmath3 m , with @xmath85 where @xmath86 , the frequency dependence of the dust grain emissivity , is @xmath87 ( the best - fit value ) .",
    "it matters little whether we adopt @xmath65 or @xmath88 , though the latter value is difficult to reconcile with the observed spectral index . in both cases our mass estimates are directly comparable with those presented elsewhere  by hughes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cimatti et al .  ( 1998 ) , for example . to adopt @xmath88 would raise our dust temperature estimate by around 10k , but the dust mass remains within 20 per cent of that deduced for @xmath65 .    to estimate @xmath81 ,",
    "we have assumed that the dust is optically thin .",
    "isothermal fits to the data then suggest that @xmath89k and @xmath90 ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "if the true far - ir opacity is significant , for example , if the dust becomes optically thick at 200@xmath3 m ( as is possibly the case for arp  220 , emerson et al .  1984 ) , then we could contrive a fit to the data which supports @xmath91k without compromising the 175- or 450-@xmath3 m data .",
    "having adopted average dust parameters , qualified the validity of our fits and explained the possible sources of error , a dust mass estimate of @xmath92m@xmath9 then follows from equation ( 2 ) of hughes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "although absolute measurements of dust masses are prone to large errors , if one wants to investigate galactic evolution by comparing the dust masses of high - redshift and low - redshift galaxies ( using dust mass as a ` galactic clock ' , eales & edmunds 1996 ) some of the sources of error are removed .",
    "uncertainties in both @xmath83 and the mass absorption coefficient are irrelevant as long as the same values are used at low and high redshift . our dust mass estimate for 8c1435 + 635 is much larger than the highest dust mass derived for local spirals by eales & edmunds ( 1996 ) : a factor of 3 if @xmath24 and a factor of 10 if @xmath93 ( local ellipticals have , of course , even lower dust masses ) .",

    "this is often claimed as evidence that the gas / dust ratio is the same at high redshifts as at low redshifts .",
    "this is not necessarily correct .",
    "the metallicity of a galaxy will be a strong function of cosmic time ( edmunds 1990 ) , and so the hydrogen / co ratio and the hydrogen / dust ratio will undoubtedly change with time ( a possibility which we consider further when estimating the gas mass in  3.3 ) .",
    "the constancy of the gas / dust ratio actually tells us that the ratio of the fraction of metals going into co to the fraction of metals being bound up in dust is not changing with cosmic time . although this may not seem a strong statement ,",
    "it is reassuring that the physics of the interstellar medium ( at least in this respect ) does not appear to be changing over a large fraction of the age of the universe .",

    "we find a value @xmath102l@xmath9 ( kkms@xmath26pc@xmath60)@xmath26 , higher than that for ultraluminous _ iras _ galaxies ( @xmath103 ) ; indeed , only quasars such as br1202@xmath740725 and h1413 + 117 ( @xmath104 ) and the radio galaxy , 4c41.17 , ( @xmath105 ) rival the efficiency with which 8c1435 + 635 apparently converts its gas into stars . without exception",
    "these systems host active nuclei , which may well indicate that what we are viewing is related to agn activity rather than the birth of their stellar populations .",
    "an estimate of sfr , as derived above from the far - ir luminosity , is inevitably of dubious value in an active object such as 8c1435 + 635 simply because it is hard to distinguish whether the dust is heated primarily by the agn or by young massive stars .",
    "however , the issue of the heating source is itself arguably of little importance because even if the dust heating could be reliably attributed to young massive stars , an estimate of the instantaneous sfr ( however reliable ) does not allow one to distinguish between a violent , short - lived starburst and a more sustained burst of star formation in which a significant fraction of the galaxy s eventual stellar mass might be converted into stars .    in practice , therefore , the most useful indicator of the evolutionary status of 8c1435 + 635 is an estimate of the mass of gas which , at the epoch of observation , has yet to be processed into stars . a massive reservoir of gas would suggest that the galaxy is extremely young ( present - day ellipticals have a large ratio of stellar mass to molecular gas mass , where the latter is typically @xmath106m@xmath9 , e.g.  wiklind , combes & henkel 1995 , lees et al .",
    "1991 ) . with the information gleaned from our continuum and spectral - line measurements , both of which are the deepest to date",
    ", we should be able to discuss the gas mass with more confidence than is usually the case .",
    "nevertheless , extrapolating from a dust mass to the total mass of baryons in a galaxy which are _ not _ already locked up in stars at the epoch of observation generally involves three , often rather uncertain , steps .",
    "first a value has to be measured or adopted for the ratio of molecular co gas to dust .",
    "second , a value has to be assumed for the ratio of molecular hydrogen to co ( expected to be a function of galaxy metallicity and hence age ) .",
    "third , to the total mass of h@xmath13 must be added the mass of atomic hydrogen through the adoption of a ratio of hi / h@xmath13 . to quantify the combined effect of uncertainties in these three steps we have chosen to calculate what can safely be regarded as rather robust lower and upper limits to the total baryonic gas mass of 8c1435 + 635 , by first adopting the highest reasonable values for _ all three _ relevant ratios , and then adopting the lowest reasonable values .",
    "the highest reasonable value for the ratio of co to dust in 8c1435 + 635 is constrained by our own failure to detect co emission . using the normal galactic calibration of @xmath101/@xmath107",
    ", our non - detection corresponds to a molecular gas / dust ratio of @xmath108 .",
    "this limit seems entirely consistent with observations of other high - redshift galaxies in which co has actually been detected ; observations of the lensed quasars br1202@xmath740725 , fsc10214 + 4724 and h1413 + 117 ( ohta et al.1996 ; omont et al .",

    "1997 ) yield values in the range @xmath110 , after correcting to our adopted cosmology ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we must then ask how reasonable it is to apply the galactic calibration to a galaxy at @xmath111 , particularly since metallicity is expected to increase with age in most reasonable models of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is at present impossible to test this directly , but we can gain some confidence that the ratio of @xmath11 in 8c1435 + 635 is indeed very unlikely to significantly exceed 1000 from observations of lyman @xmath31 absorbers .",
    "studies of damped lyman @xmath31 absorption systems suggest @xmath112 ( fall , pei & mcmahon 1989 ; wolfe 1993 ) and we can be confident that 8c1435 + 635 is a more highly evolved system than damped lyman absorbers , the supposed progenitors of disk galaxies , since 8c1435 + 635 is already more luminous than an @xmath113 galaxy in starlight .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath114 , and hence @xmath115m@xmath9 as an upper limit to the molecular gas mass of 8c1435 + 635 .",
    "we thus simply sidestep the issue of whether this gas mass arises from a co luminosity close to our limit coupled with a near - galactic calibration , or whether the co luminosity is much lower and a low - metallicity calibration might apply .",
    "lastly to produce an upper limit on total baryonic gas mass we must adopt a generous value for the ratio @xmath116 .",

    "1997 ) found @xmath117 for h1413 + 117 , although this may have been affected by differential lensing ; andreani , casoli & mirabel ( 1995 ) found @xmath118 for _ iras _ galaxies ; wiklind et al.(1995 ) found @xmath119 for far - ir - selected elliptical galaxies , whereas lees et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found @xmath120 ) . for our present purpose",
    "we therefore adopt the largest of these values ( @xmath121 ) and hence arrive at a robust upper limit of @xmath122 for 8c1435 + 635 within our adopted cosmology ( the effect of varying cosmology is discussed in  4 ) .",
    "we now proceed , in an analogous way , to calculate a highly conservative value for the total gas mass in 8c1435 + 635 .",
    "models of galactic evolution suggest that metallicity should increase with time , and that the gas / dust ratio should decrease accordingly ( edmunds 1990 ) .",
    "if we take the gas / dust ratio appropriate for present - day galaxies , we should therefore obtain a firm lower limit for the true gas content of 8c1435 + 635 .",
    "estimates of the gas / dust ratio in the local universe range from @xmath123 for the milky way to @xmath124 for some nearby galaxies ( usually where only the warm dust has been sampled  devereux & young 1990 ) , and so we adopt @xmath125 ( accepting the galactic calibration for @xmath66/@xmath107 ) to deduce @xmath126 as an firm lower limit to the molecular gas mass of 8c1435 + 635 .    finally , we apply the adopt the lowest of the reported values for @xmath127 discussed above ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) to arrive at a robust lower limit of @xmath129 for 8c1435 + 635 within our adopted cosmology .",
    "what then can we conclude from our basic result that 8c1435 + 635 contains between @xmath14 and @xmath130m@xmath9 of material which has yet to be turned into stars at the epoch of observation corresponding to @xmath131 ?",
    "one important , and _ model - independent _ point , is that our new observations have largely served to confirm the similarity between the sub - mm properties of 8c1435 + 635 and 4c41.17 , despite differences between their optical morphologies , surface brightnesses , colors and spectra .",
    "the fact that these two objects , both at @xmath131 and both with comparably extreme radio luminosities , should both appear to contain a few @xmath132m@xmath9 of gas must be telling us something rather basic .",
    "in simple terms , the extreme far - ir luminosities , dust and gas masses of these two sources must either be due to their extreme redshift , or associated in some way with their extreme radio luminosities .",
    "observations of larger samples of sources spanning a range in redshift and in radio luminosity will be required to answer this question , but it is interesting to consider briefly the implications of either option .    if these extreme sub - mm properties are due primarily to redshift , this would imply that all massive ellipticals at @xmath131 could still be in the process of forming a significant fraction of their eventual stellar populations . indeed ,",
    "if it is assumed that the present - day counterpart of 8c1435 + 635 is a very massive elliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath133m@xmath9 , the upper end of our derived range of gas masses is consistent with a picture in which , at the epoch of observation , 8c1435 + 635 has yet to form the _ vast majority _ of its eventual stellar population .",
    "this possibility gains further credence from the fact that our derived dust mass has arguably been minimized to a certain extent by the assumption of an einstein - de sitter universe . in a low - density universe",
    "the derived masses increase by up to a factor of four , in which case even our lower limit on the gas mass rises to @xmath134 making it difficult to argue against the conclusion that 8c1435 + 635 is rather young .",
    "would such a conclusion be consistent with the recent discovery that the dominant stellar population in at least some ( and arguably all ) radio galaxies is already @xmath135gyr old by @xmath136 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; spinrad et al .",
    "the answer is yes , and indeed there is an interesting ( if somewhat frustrating ) degeneracy at work here : reducing @xmath27 to the point where it is hard to escape the conclusion that 8c1435 + 635 and 4c41.17 contain an entire galaxy s worth of gas also stretches the cosmological timescale , allowing 3gyr to elapse between @xmath137 and @xmath138 , in which case the epoch of spectacular sub - mm emission from young elliptical galaxies would indeed be expected to correspond to @xmath139 .",
    "if our derived lower limit on the gas mass of @xmath140m@xmath9 is in fact closer to the truth then we would seem to be forced back towards the conclusion that we are witnessing either ( i ) the tail end of the formation process of massive ellipticals , or ( ii ) a new injection of gas / dust from an interaction which we see heated by the agn or by a violent interaction - induced starburst in what could be an otherwise well - evolved underlying galaxy whose stars were formed at still higher redshift .",
    "this latter option seems completely plausible because while the ages of radio sources and their host galaxies appear to be completely decoupled ( differing by two orders of magnitude at the present day ) , the fact that global radio - source activity seems to trace the cosmic star - formation history of the universe ( dunlop 1997 ) suggests that both radio sources and starbursts are fueled in a fundamentally similar way , perhaps through galaxy - galaxy interactions . in this context it would perhaps not be too surprising if the massive fuel supplies required to power the ultra - luminous radio sources 8c1435 + 635 and 4c41.17 also inevitably resulted in an associated massive burst of star - formation activity .",
    "of course in a heirarchical picture of galaxy formation the distinction between a massive merger and the final stages of galaxy formation might be viewed as rather artificial .",
    "while uncertainties beyond the scope of this work ( e.g.  the value of @xmath27 and the metallicity of high redshift radio galaxies ) mean that the precise interpretation of the large mass of dust residing in 8c1435 + 635 remains ambiguous , we have demonstrated the power of scuba to constrain the properties of dust in galaxies at @xmath111 .",
    "the radio galaxies 8c1435 + 635 and 4c41.17 are undeniably extreme objects , but their very similar dust and gas masses mean that they can certainly serve as useful benchmarks for future sub - mm studies of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "thus , whilst at present we can not determine whether the spectacular far - ir properties of 8c1435 + 635 and 4c41.17 are primarily due to their extreme redshifts , or their extreme radio luminosities , the quality of our scuba data provides encouragement that sub - mm observations of complete samples of radio galaxies , spanning a range of redshifts and radio luminosities , should be able to settle this issue in the near future .",
    "perhaps most exciting of all , our observations of 8c1435 + 635 serve to re - emphasize that if most massive ellipticals do indeed form in comparably spectacular starbursts , such objects will be easily detected by the first sub - mm surveys of blank fields , even out to @xmath141 ."
