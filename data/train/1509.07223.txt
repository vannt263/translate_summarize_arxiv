    "wireless communications are inherently insecure , due to the broadcast nature of the medium , which makes security a pivotal design issue in the implementation and operation of current and future wireless networks . compared to the traditional key - based cryptographic techniques that are applied to upper layers , physical layer security can enhance the secrecy of wireless communications without using secret keys and complex encryption / decryption algorithms , and thus has been recognized as an alternative for cryptographic techniques .",
    "the key idea of physical layer security is to exploit the randomness of wireless channels to offer secure data transmissions @xcite . in early studies , e.g. , @xcite , the principle of physical layer security",
    "was established in a single - input single - output wiretap channel .",
    "subsequently , physical layer security in multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) communication systems has been intensively investigated @xcite , due to the benefits of mimo techniques such as high data rate and high link reliability .",
    "most recently , physical layer security in large - scale wireless networks , such as mobile ad hoc and sensor networks , has been receiving considerable attention @xcite .",
    "a key property of large - scale wireless networks is that the node locations in the network were spatially randomly distributed . as such , stochastic geometry and random geometric graphs",
    "are used for modeling the locations of spatially random - distributed nodes . in @xcite ,",
    "the throughput of large - scale decentralized wireless networks with physical layer security constraints was investigated .",
    "considering the path loss as the sole factor influencing the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver , @xcite examined the secrecy rate in cellular networks . in @xcite",
    "the secrecy rate achieved by linear precoding was analyzed in the broadcast channel with spatially random external eavesdroppers , and in @xcite the secrecy rate achieved by linear precoding in cellular networks was analyzed .",
    "we note that @xcite only considered point - to - point transmissions .",
    "this leaves physical layer security with cooperative relays in large - scale networks as an open problem .",
    "since the relay channel efficiently improves the coverage and reliability in wireless networks @xcite , it is of practical significance to investigate the secrecy performance of such channels . particularly important in this context would be extensions of previous work on relay wiretap channels which focused on scenarios where the location of an eavesdropper(s ) is fixed and known at the source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this work we propose a secure transmission scheme for a relay wiretap channel , where a source transmits to a destination via a decode - and - forward ( df ) relay in the presence of multiple spatially random - distributed eavesdroppers .",
    "the source is equipped with multiple antennas , while the relay , the destination , and the eavesdropper are equipped with a single antenna each .",
    "in addition to information signals , we assume that the source transmit artificial noise signals in order to confuse the eavesdroppers . aiming at maximizing the secrecy throughput , while satisfying a secrecy outage probability constraint , we determine both the optimal power allocation factor between an signals and information signals and the optimal wiretap code rates .    compared to current studies on physical layer security in relay networks @xcite , our contributions are threefold .",
    "first , we consider a more practical scenario where the locations of the eavesdroppers are spatially randomly distributed and not known at the source .",
    "second , we propose a new secure transmission scheme that maximizes the secrecy throughput in such a scenario .",
    "third , we derive explicit expressions for the transmission outage probability and the secrecy outage probability , which enable us to analytically characterize the secrecy throughput of the relay wiretap channel .",
    "we note that these expressions are independent of realizations of the main channel and the eavesdropper channel .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system_model ] describes the system model and presents the proposed scheme . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we analyze and optimize the secrecy performance achieved by the proposed scheme . numerical results and related discussions are presented in section [ sec : numerical ] . finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] draws conclusions .",
    "we consider a relay wiretap channel , as depicted in fig . [ system_model ] , where a source ( s ) communicates with a destination ( d ) with the aid of a relay ( r ) in the presence of multiple spatially random eavesdroppers .",
    "we assume that the source is equipped with @xmath0 antennas , while the destination , the relay , and the eavesdroppers are equipped with a single antenna each .",
    "we also assume that there is no direct link between the source and the destination .",
    "we denote @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the distance between the source and the relay and the distance between the relay and the destination , respectively , and denote @xmath3 as the path loss exponent . as in @xcite ,",
    "the eavesdroppers are modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath4 with density @xmath5 .",
    "this model is practical and representative for decentralized networks where each node is randomly distributed @xcite .",
    "the source , the relay , and the destination do not belong to @xmath4 .",
    "we now detail the proposed transmission scheme .",
    "the proposed scheme utilizes two time slots . in the first time slot ,",
    "the source transmits information signals together with an signals to the relay . in this time slot ,",
    "the transmitted signals from the source are overheard by the eavesdroppers .",
    "the role of the an signals is to confuse the eavesdroppers . in the second time slot",
    ", we assume that the source is silent .",
    "while it is clear that this will lead to a sub - optimal solution , such an assumption does allow for analytical tractability in a special case . removing this assumption means",
    "more power can be added to the signal in the first time slot .",
    "our other work @xcite , in which we consider multiple antennae at all nodes , quantifies the advantage of adding source noise in the second time slot .",
    "we also assume the relay transmits the received signals to the destination using the df protocol . in this time slot",
    ", the broadcast signals are also overheard by the eavesdroppers .",
    "we assume that all the channels are subject to independent and identically distributed rayleigh fading .",
    "we also assume a quasi - static block fading environment in which all the channel coefficients remain the same within one time slot .",
    "we denote @xmath6 as the @xmath7 channel vector from the source to the relay and denote @xmath8 as the channel coefficient from the relay to the destination .",
    "we now express the transmitted and received signals in two time slots separately . in the first time slot , the transmitted signal at the source is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 beamforming matrix at the source and @xmath12 denotes the combination of the information signal and the an signal . to perform a such transmission , we first design @xmath10 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is used to transmit the information signal and @xmath15",
    "is used to transmit the an signal .",
    "the aim of @xmath10 is to degrade the quality of the received signals at the eavesdroppers . by transmitting an signals into the null space of @xmath6 through @xmath10",
    ", the source ensures that the quality of the received signals at the relay is free from an interference . in designing @xmath10 ,",
    "we choose @xmath14 as the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath16 .",
    "we then choose @xmath15 as the remaining @xmath17 eigenvectors of @xmath16 .",
    "such a design ensures that @xmath10 is a unitary matrix .",
    "we then design @xmath12 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the information signal and @xmath20 is an @xmath21 vector of the an signal .",
    "we define @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as the fraction of the power allocated to the information signal . as such",

    "moreover , we confirm that @xmath29=\\mathbf{i}_n$ ] . based on , , and",
    ", the received signal at the relay in the first time slot is expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the transmit power at the source , and @xmath32 denotes the thermal noise at the relay , which is assumed to be a zero mean complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "we next express the received signal at a typical eavesdropper located at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in the first time slot as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the @xmath7 channel vector from the source to the typical eavesdropper located at @xmath35 , @xmath39 denotes the distance between the source and the typical eavesdropper located at @xmath35 , and @xmath40 denotes the thermal noise at the typical eavesdropper located at @xmath35 , which is assumed to be a zero mean complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 .    in the second time slot",
    ", the relay adopts the df protocol to forward signals to the destination .",
    "specifically , the relay first decodes the transmitted signals from the source and then broadcasts them after re - encoding .",
    "therefore , we express the received signal at the destination as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the transmit power at the relay , @xmath8 denotes the channel coefficient from the relay to the destination , @xmath45 denotes the transmitted signal of the relay with @xmath46=1 $ ] , and @xmath47 denotes the thermal noise at the destination , which is assumed to be a zero mean complex random variable with variance @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 .",

    "we express the instantaneous snr at the destination as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for the instantaneous snr at the eavesdroppers ,",
    "we assume that the eavesdroppers are non - colluding , which means that each eavesdropper decodes her own received signals from the source and the relay , without cooperating with other eavesdroppers .",

    "mathematically , @xmath67 is formulated as @xmath69 henceforth , we refer to @xmath70 as the secrecy throughput .    the goal of this work is to maximize the secrecy throughput of the relay wiretap channel with spatially random eavesdroppers under secrecy constraints . to achieve this goal",
