    "high energy astrophysical sources show a temporal variability in a broad spectral range . the x - ray ( 1 - 10 kev ) and hard x - ray ranges ( 10 - 100 kev ) are especially important observing windows to understand the temporal characteristics of high energy sources which involve spectral changes .",
    "for instance , a black hole candidate shows state changes in its flux and spectrum ; in the quiescent state the x - ray emission is dominated by the hard emission , whereas in outburst the soft emission from the accretion disk becomes dominate .",
    "some low mass x - ray binaries produces bright bursts in x - rays , so called x - ray bursts , which are caused by thermonuclear flashes of accreting material on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "an accreting x - ray binary pulsar sometimes shows intense outbursts in x - rays when the neutron star passes the disk or dense stellar wind of its companion .",
    "cyclotron resonance lines , one of the direct observational approaches to measure the magnetic field of a neutron star , are most easily observable in the hard x - ray range from binary pulsar during outburst .",
    "an isolated neutron star with a high magnetic field , a so called magnetar , occasionally shows an outburst with multiple short duration bursts in hard x - rays believed originate from a large release of its internal magnetic energy . the time - domain astronomy which has been revolutionized by _",
    "@xcite has become a frontier field of astronomy .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) onboard _ swift _ has been monitoring the hard x - ray sky ( 14 - 200 kev ) thanks to its wide field of view since 2004 . on the other hand , the gas slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ) on the _ maxi _ mission @xcite has been observing the sky in softer energy band ( 2 - 30 kev ) since 2009 .",
    "both instrument teams are providing the light curve data in real - time to the public @xcite .",
    "however , the swift / bat transient monitor @xcite is limited to a single energy band of 15 - 50 kev because the pipeline is using the data extracted in a single 15 - 50 kev band on - board ( the data product called the bat scaled - map data ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no realtime transient monitor producing light curves in the full dynamic range of the bat and the gsc data with the same time axis . by combining the data of the bat and the gsc , we are able to construct broadband light curves of high energy transient sources with a high scientific merit .",
    "for example , the spectral state changes of several black hole candidates are investigated intensively using the bat and the gsc data ( xte j1752@xmath0223 , e.g. , @xcite ; swift j1753.5@xmath00127 , e.g. , @xcite ; swift j1910.2@xmath00546 , e.g. , @xcite ; gx 339@xmath04 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the state transition of bright low - mass x - ray binaries have also been studied in detail using both bat and gsc data ( e.g. , @xcite . ) . using both the _ maxi _ and the _ integral _ data , there is the web page for monitoring x - ray and hard x - ray activities of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "therefore there is a great demand to gather broad band light curves of high - energy transient sources from multiple missions and present them in a consistent format along a single time axis .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the broadband transient monitor utilizing the bat and gsc data .",
    "this transient monitor covers the dynamic range from 2 kev to 200 kev , which is ideal to monitor high energy transients in a broad spectral coverage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the analysis method in  2 . in ",
    "3 , our broadband transient monitor is introduced .",
    "we further discuss our broadband transient monitor in  4 .",
    "the flowchart of our pipeline is shown in figure [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "as the initial step to construct the broadband transient monitor , independent pipelines were developed just to mirror the _",
    "swift _ bat data to our server .",
    "this step is rather crucial for the entire process because it takes a significant amount of time to download the bat data from the _ swift _ data archive center in the u.s .",
    "( swift data center ( sdc ) and heasarc ) to japan .",
    "since the _ swift _ data are initially stored at the sdc , and then , archived to the heasarc seven days after the observation , two separate pipelines were developed to mirror both sdc and heasarc data , which are available to the public from our web server ( the sdc data mirror and the heasarc data mirror ) located in japan .",
    "note that only the swift / bat related data are mirrored from the heasarc to our server .",
    "the script to mirror the sdc data is running once an hour , whereas the script to mirror the heasarc archive runs once a day .",
    "the basic bat data analysis is performed using the heasoft software package .",
    "the batsurvey script is used to process the bat survey ( detector plane histogram ( dph ) ) data .",
    "the default eight energy bands ( 14 - 20 kev , 20 - 24 kev , 24 - 35 kev , 35 - 50 kev , 50 - 75 kev , 75 - 100 kev , 100 - 150 kev and 150 - 195 kev ) and the original time resolution of the dph data ( timesep = `` dph '' ) were specified in the script .",
    "the typical exposure time of the original dph data is five minutes .",
    "products are made for 146 sources which were flagged as bright hard x - ray sources in the bat 70 month all - sky hard x - ray survey @xcite .",
    "the data after august 2009 , when _ maxi _ and _ swift _ operations overlap , were processed .",
    "the batsurvey script produces so - called ` level 2 ' catalogs for each source , which contain the extracted count - rate and the incident angle of the source .",
    "once the batsurvey process is completed , all the level 2 catalogs ( final outputs of the batsurvey script ) are merged using batsurvey - catnum script and time sorted by ftsort for all 146 sources .",
    "the bat count rates extracted by the batsurvey script must be corrected for the energy dependent vignetting of incoming photons @xcite . to model this off - axis effect in the count rate at each energy band , we processed the survey data between 2004 and 2005 , when the crab nebula was in the field of view at various incident angles .",
    "figure [ fig : crab_offaxis ] illustrates the significant energy dependent systematic effect between the crab count rate and incident angle in the 15 - 20 kev and the 100 - 150 kev band , as an example .",
    "a quadratic function was used to fit the trend between the count rate and the incident angle for all eight energy bands ( table [ tbl : offaxis_corr ] ) . in each band , the count rate is corrected by the rate of the on - axis crab rate to the estimated crab rate at the given incident angle .",
    "next , the original eight energy bands are binned to four energy bands ( 14 - 24 kev , 24 - 50 kev , 50 - 100 kev and 100 - 195 kev ) . and",
    "then , a one day averaged and a 90-minutes ( 1 orbit ) averaged light curves are generated using rebingausslc .",
    "the _ maxi _ gsc one day and 90 minutes light curves are downloaded from the _ maxi _ public web page for the common sources of the bat 146 bright sources in the input catalog of the bat data process and the 369 ( as of july 2015 ) sources listed in the _ maxi _ public web page . the number of common sources in the current monitor is 106 .",
    "this limitation mainly comes from the number of sources in the bat input catalog .",
    "however , since all the created bat sky images are stored in our computer , only the source extraction tool , batcelldetect , is needed to run through all the archival images to add a new source from the bat data .",
    "we have a plan to add the sources which were detected in outburst in the bat transient monitor @xcite in the past six years to our transient monitor pipeline .",
    "the light curves of the bat and the gsc are combined and plots are generated using the python matplotlib module .",
    "the bat light curve data are available in fits format .",
    "the interactive light curve based on the python mpld3 module is also available , so that a user can move and zoom - in the light curve interactively .",
    "our broadband transient monitor is available to the public from the web server at aoyama gakuin university : http://yoshidalab.mydns.jp / bat_gsc_trans_mon/. currently , the broadband light curves of 106 known sources are accessible from the web page .",
    "the web page updates @xmath13 times a day depending on the amount of the data which need to be processed .",
    "the products of our bat - gsc broadband transient monitor are summarized in table [ tbl : bb_product_summary ] .    here",
    ", we highlight the products of several sources in our broadband transient monitor .",
    "figure [ fig : bb_lc_cygx1 ] and [ fig : bb_lc_grs1915 ] show our broadband light curves of the black hole binaries cygnus x-1 and grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "those light curves clearly show multiple spectral state transitions between  low - hard \" and  high - soft \" states , which are believed to indicate a change in the geometry of the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the last clear state change was happening around mjd 57125 for cygnus x-1 and around mdj 56252 for grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "as can be seen in the light curves , the borderline energy which the emission becomes brighter or dimmer when the source is in the high - soft state is around 10 kev for cygnus x-1 and 15 kev for grb 1915 + 105 .",
    "figure [ fig : bb_lc_gx339 ] shows the long - term temporal behavior of gx 339 - 4 , a galactic transit black hole with a low - mass companion . during the giant outburst in the year 2010 ( e.g. , mjd 55200 - 55600 ) , the burst emission showed a strong hard - to - soft evolution .",
    "the initial hard emission was visible up to the highest energy band of 100 - 195 kev .",
    "this hard x - ray emission episode is dominated by comptonized photons from the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-ray blazar , mrk 421 , showed several flares visible up to 100 kev ( figure [ fig : bb_lc_mrk421 ] ) .",
    "since the bat energy range is located at the dip between the two broad peaks in the spectral energy distribution of mrk 421 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the bat hard x - ray emission is not that evident compared to the soft x - ray band of the gsc .",
    "however , during the outburst , the hard x - ray emission is clearly visible in the bat data , and the broad - spectral properties of the source can be investigated using our monitor .",
    "figure [ fig : bb_lc_ngc4151 ] shows the light curve of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 4151 which has a hard continuum in its spectrum @xcite . unlike previous examples , its emission and the temporal variability are clearly visible in the bat data rather than the gsc data .    in figure [",
    "fig : bb_lc_a0535 ] , the several giant outburst episodes are visible in the broadband light curve of a high - mass x - ray pulsar a0535 + 262 .",
    "since the emission during the giant outbursts were so intense , the temporal profile up to 100 kev is clearly visible even in the one orbit light curve ( right panel of figure [ fig : bb_lc_a0535 ] ) .",
    "a recent study showed that the energy of the cyclotron resonance line of a0535 + 262 , which was found typically around 45 kev , increased when the flux was high @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to monitor those cyclotron sources in a broad energy band to understand the transient spectral features in various flux levels .",
    "as can be seen in those examples , our transient monitor includes various types of sources and can monitor interesting temporal and spectral stages of high energy sources .",
    "we constructed the broadband transient monitor using the _ swift _ bat and the _ maxi _ gsc data and made it available to the public .",
    "this work is the first attempt to analyse the bat survey data in real - time for constructing multi - band light curves .",
    "although the updating frequency of the light curve is still not ideal , we can now run the pipeline several times a day in real - time .    although it varies based on the _ swift _ pointing , a typical exposure time of an individual object for the bat is roughly four hours per day ( about eight hours at the highest day ) . applying the bat survey sensitivity equation described in @xcite",
    ", this typical exposure corresponds to a 5-sigma sensitivity of @xmath110 mcrab ( 14 - 195 kev ) .",
    "on the other hand , the daily averaged 5-sigma sensitivity of the gsc is @xmath115 mcrab in the 4 - 10 kev band @xcite .",
    "therefore , the daily sensitivity of the bat and the gsc are comparable .",
    "therefore , it is a good match to combine the bat and the gsc data to monitor high energy transient sources on a daily basis .",
    "all the _ maxi _ gsc light curve data in the current broadband transient monitor is downloaded from the _ maxi _ s public web page .",
    "since all of the light curves are created using an aperture photometry method @xcite , the count rates in the light curves could be contaminated with bright x - ray sources located near the object . due to a relatively poor position resolution of the gsc ,",
    "if other bright x - ray source is located within 2 degrees from the object , there might be an issue in the light curve .",
    "for those sources which could be affected by nearby contaminations , we have a future plan to generate the gsc light curves of the source using the point spread function ( psf ) fit method which should provide a contamination free light curve @xcite using the gsc data . at the current stage",
    ", the sources which are located within 2 degrees from catalog sources in the rosat bright source catalog @xcite with the count rate greater than 1 count s@xmath3 are flagged as possible contaminated sources at the top page of the monitor ( see table [ tbl : src_list ] ) .",
    "the processing time of the current pipeline is limited by the analysis of the bat survey data .",
    "our pipeline is processing the bat survey data at the finest time resolution with the eight energy bands .",
    "although we can process the data in the coarser time resolution and the smaller energy bands to speed up the process , the best spectral and temporal information can be extracted in the current setup for the bat data .",
    "for example , the outputs of our pipeline can provide 8 channel spectral data of the sources every five minutes when high energy sources are in the very bright state .",
    "we have a plan to process the data with multiple available computers or graphical processing unit ( gpu ) to speed up the process .",
    "the current broadband transient monitor contains 106 sources .",
    "however , it is not a difficult task to add sources to the monitor .",
    "we are planning to add sources based on not only the information from various observatories ( e.g. , the astronomer s telegram , the gamma - ray coordinates network ) but also requests from the community .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for comments and suggestions that materially improved the paper .",
