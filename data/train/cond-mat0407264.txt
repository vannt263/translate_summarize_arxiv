    "in the physics of highly correlated electron systems the electronic orbitals and their interactions are in the focus of recent experimental and theoretical research , because the orbitals play a key role in the coupling of charge and spin of the electrons with the lattice .",
    "transition - metal oxides , where the shape and anisotropy of the @xmath3electron orbitals determine the fundamental electronic properties , provide a rich field for this kind of investigations . for example the perovskite titanates @xmath4tio@xmath5 ( with @xmath4 = y , la , or some trivalent rare - earth ion ) are known as realization of a mott insulator .",
    "the @xmath6 electronic configuration of ti@xmath7 corresponds to an effectively half - filled conduction band , where the on - site coulomb repulsion inhibits double occupation of the ti ",
    "sites resulting in an insulating ground state.@xcite although from their electronic configuration these titanates seem to be quite simple model systems , their orbital properties still have to be resolved especially in the case of latio@xmath5 .",
    "the debate on the orbital ground state of latio@xmath5 was triggered by its unusual magnetic properties .",
    "below the nel temperature @xmath8  k,@xcite latio@xmath5 reveals a slightly canted @xmath9type antiferromagnetic structure with an ordered moment of @xmath10,@xcite which is strongly reduced as compared to the spin - only value of @xmath11 and , hence , indicates a strong importance of the spin - orbit coupling . on the other hand the nearly isotropic spin - wave dispersion with a small gap of about 3  mev contradicts a dominant spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    this puzzling situation originates from the fact that the orthorhombic gdfeo@xmath5 structure of latio@xmath5 deviates only weakly from the ideal cubic perovskite structure : the quasicubic crystal field of the nearly ideal oxygen octahedron surrounding the ti@xmath7 ion splits the five orbital @xmath1 levels into a lower @xmath12 triplet and an excited @xmath13 doublet .",
    "the single electron occupies the lower @xmath12 triplet and is jahn - teller active.@xcite in principle the jahn - teller effect is expected to lift the remaining threefold degeneracy resulting in a distortion of the oxygen octahedron in favor of one of the three orbitals .",
    "however , the competing influence of spin - orbit coupling can not be neglected in the case of a single electron in a @xmath12 level , as has been outlined already by goodenough@xcite and by kugel and khomskii.@xcite it is important to note that , as long as the orbital triplet remains degenerate , the exchange interactions are inherently frustrated even in a cubic lattice.@xcite    to promote possible physics of this degeneracy in latio@xmath5 , an orbital - liquid ground state has been suggested.@xcite further detailed theoretical studies@xcite favoring the orbital - liquid picture worked out that the frustration can be resolved via an order - by - disorder mechanism giving rise to magnetic spin order with disordered orbital states .",
    "the observed spin - wave excitations were found to be in accord with this model . in a different theoretical approach",
    "@xcite the crystal field of the la ions caused by the gdfeo@xmath5type distortion has been shown to lift the degeneracy of the ti@xmath12orbitals and to stabilize the antiferromagnetic @xmath9type order . in ref .",
    "the orbital - ground state was derived as approximately @xmath14 .",
    "however , solovyev @xcite has found that the hartree - fock approximation alone fails to provide the description of the magnetic properties of latio@xmath5 and ytio@xmath5 .",
    "several recent experimental investigations strongly support the existence of orbital order in latio@xmath5 . specific - heat , electrical resistivity , thermal - expansion , and infrared experiments@xcite exhibit anomalies near the nel temperature , which indicate significant structural changes and have been interpreted in terms of the influence of orbital order via magneto - elastic interactions .",
    "transmission - electron microscopy revealed small atomic displacements ascribed to a weak jahn - teller distortion.@xcite detailed x - ray and neutron - diffraction studies@xcite of crystal and magnetic structure revealed an intrinsic distortion of the oxygen octahedra , which leads to a large enough splitting of the ti@xmath12 triplet state .",
    "the remeasured magnetic moment @xmath15 turned out to be slightly larger than determined before.@xcite the reexamination of the ti nuclear magnetic resonance spectra@xcite proves a large nuclear quadrupole splitting , which is ascribed to a rather large quadrupole moment of the @xmath1 electrons at the ti sites .",
    "this discarded the earlier interpretation@xcite of the nmr results in terms of orbital degeneracy and clearly favored the orbital order .    in this communication",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the temperature dependence and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of latio@xmath5 , which we obtained on an untwinned single crystal . in an earlier publication",
    "@xcite it was mentioned that the anisotropy observed in the paramagnetic regime requires to include the spin - orbit coupling into the crystal - field calculation . in the present analysis",
    "we develop this approach and go beyond the hartree - fock approximation.@xcite besides the spin - orbit coupling we are taking into account the ti  o exchange as well .",
    "we will show that the obtained orbital - order pattern is basically in agreement with nmr data @xcite and allows to describe consistently the temperature dependence and anisotropy of the observed experimental susceptibility .",
    "in latio@xmath0 the ti@xmath7 ions ( electronic configuration @xmath6 , spin @xmath16 ) are situated in slightly distorted octahedra formed by the oxygen ions .",
    "the dominant cubic component of the crystal field splits the five @xmath1electron states into a lower triplet @xmath12 and an upper doublet @xmath17 .",
    "the low - symmetry component of the crystal field is expected to be small with respect to the cubic one and , therefore , one may be tempted to analyze the magnetic susceptibility using the basis of the @xmath12 states with a fictitious orbital momentum @xmath18 , only.@xcite however , this procedure is not convenient for latio@xmath0 for the following reason : indeed , the wave functions of the fictitious momentum @xmath18 are defined in a local coordinate system @xmath19 with its axes parallel to the @xmath20 axes of the non distorted octahedra . in the real structure of latio@xmath0 ,",
    "there are four different fragments tio@xmath21 , which are distorted and rotated with respect to each other , i.e. the @xmath18 basis should be rotated correspondingly for each of the four inequivalent octahedra . during these rotations",
    "all @xmath1electron states are mixed . in this situation",
    "it is preferable to stay in the crystallographic coordinate system using the full basis of @xmath1electron states .    thus , to determine the energy - level scheme of ti@xmath7 in latio@xmath5 , we start from the hamiltonian @xmath22 the first term denotes the spin - orbit coupling with spin @xmath23 and orbital momentum @xmath24 .",
    "for ti@xmath7 the parameter of the spin - orbit coupling is expected to be about @xmath25  k.@xcite the second term represents the crystal field with the spherical tensor @xmath26 .",
    "the crystal - field parameters @xmath27 are calculated using available data about the crystal structure .",
    "@xcite the sum runs over the lattice sites @xmath28 .",
    "the main contributions to the quantities @xmath29 originate from the point charges @xmath30 of the lattice and so called exchange charges .",
    "hence , the intrinsic parameters of the crystal field are given by @xmath31 the exchange contribution originates from the charge transfer from oxygen into the unfilled @xmath1shell , i.e. the covalence effect , and the direct titanium - oxygen exchange coupling:@xcite @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denote the overlap integrals for ti@xmath36o@xmath37 , which are determined in local coordinate systems with the @xmath38axis along the titanium - oxygen bond .",
    "all integrals are calculated using the hartree - fock wave functions@xcite of ti@xmath7 and o@xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is an adjustable parameter , which we have extracted from the cubic crystal - field splitting parameter @xmath41 , which can be assumed as approximately similar for all titanium oxides , as e. g. for ti@xmath7 in al@xmath42o@xmath0 with @xmath43  @xmath44.@xcite    in latio@xmath0 there is no inversion symmetry at the oxygen position and , therefore , each oxygen ion exhibits a dipole moment @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the polarization constant @xcite and @xmath47 is the electric field of the surrounding ions at the oxygen site with number @xmath48 . for the oxygen positions @xcite o1 ( @xmath49 , 0.25 , @xmath50 ) and o2 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) at @xmath54  k , the values of the dipole moments ( in units of @xmath55 ) were calculated as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( o1 ) and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( o2 ) , respectively .",
    "the relative signs for the other three o1 and seven o2 positions change like the signs of the corresponding coordinates ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath38 ) , e. g. for the o1 position ( @xmath66 , 0.25 , @xmath67 ) we obtain @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath68 and so on .",
    "the corresponding expressions for corrections to the crystal - field parameters @xmath69 are calculated as usual.@xcite    in the crystallographic coordinate system , with the cartesian axes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath38 chosen along the crystal axes @xmath70   , @xmath71   , and @xmath72    in pnma representation ( corresponding to @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 in pbnm representation , which is used in many papers ) , respectively , ( values at room temperature 298  k ) we obtain the crystal - field parameters ( in k ) for the titanium ion in position ti1@xmath76 as given in table  [ cfp ] . for the other three titanium positions the absolute values of @xmath29 are the same , but their signs are different ( cf . table  [ signs ] ) . note that the quantum mechanical contributions are comparable to the classical ones and even dominate for @xmath77 .",

    "@xcite the effective magnetic moment per one ti@xmath7 is about @xmath91 .",
    "the antiferromagnetically ordered moments are aligned along the @xmath74direction and weak ferromagnetism shows up along the @xmath73direction ( in pnma).@xcite we suggest that this can be explained as follows : due to the spin - orbit coupling the orientations of the titanium magnetic moments are connected with the quadrupole ordering . if we assume that the spin is aligned perpendicular to the @xmath1electron charge - distribution plane , i. e. along @xmath92 , a ferromagnetic alignement along the @xmath73axis can result from the @xmath65 component of @xmath93 , which is positive at all four ti places , and a @xmath9type antiferromagnetic order along the @xmath74axis is favored as the sign of the @xmath38component of @xmath93 changes between the ti sites , correspondingly .",
    "as neutron scattering detects the averaged magnetic moment of the four inequivalent ti places per unit cell with vice versa twisting of the quadrupolar moments , the observed @xmath91 is just the projection of the total magnetic moments onto the @xmath74direction .",
    "the latio@xmath5 single crystal , prepared by floating zone melting,@xcite was essentially the same as used previously for the thermal - expansion measurements described in ref .  .",
    "the crystallographic axes were determined from x - ray laue pictures .",
    "additional neutron - diffraction experiments@xcite on the same crystal revealed only a small twin - domain of about 5% of the crystal volume , hence the crystal can be regarded as practically untwinned .",

    "it is remarkable that absolute value and anisotropy are very well reproduced by this straight - forward calculation .    in the second step , we allowed a variation of the covalency parameters @xmath140 . with the same exchange constant of 200  k and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 ( dotted lines ) the description of the relative splitting of the susceptibilities between the different axes is improved , but the curvature is still not reproduced",

    "we have got @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "these deviations from the nearest - neighbor isotropic molecular - field results can be considered as a hint for an spin - orbit dependent exchange like @xmath153 between the titanium ions . in principle",

    "another influence , which to our opinion can not be excluded as well , is the next nearest neighbor interaction between the titanium ions .",
    "obviously this question should be addressed to further analysis , when more experimental information will be obtained .",
    "however , both types of mentioned interactions can produce the corrections of a few percent , but we believe that the essential physics of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and orbital ordering will be the same as described above .    note that the factor @xmath108 is quite large and , therefore , according to eq .",

    "we have estimated the quadrupole moments at the ti sites and have deduced the charge - distribution picture for the @xmath1electrons in the crystallographic coordinate system .",
    "based on the orientation of the quadrupolar tensor , it is possible to suggest an explanation for the low value of the ordered moment , observed in the antiferromagnetic state . the straight - forward calculation of the paramagnetic susceptibility yields the correct anisotropy , which we measured in an untwinned latio@xmath5 single crystal .",
