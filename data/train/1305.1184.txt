    "the most important aim of weather forecasting is to give a robust and reliable prediction of the future state of the atmosphere based on observational data , prior forecasts and mathematical models describing the dynamical and physical behaviour of the atmosphere .",
    "these models consists of sets of hydro - thermodynamic non - linear partial differential equations of the atmosphere and its coupled systems ( like surface or oceans for instance ) and have only numerical solutions .",
    "the difficulty with these numerical weather prediction models is that since the atmosphere has a chaotic character the solutions strongly depend on the initial conditions and also on other uncertainties related to the numerical weather prediction process",
    ". therefore , the results of such models are never fully accurate .",
    "a possible solution is to run the model with different initial conditions ( since the uncertainties in the initial conditions are one of the most important sources of uncertainty ) and produce an ensemble of forecasts .",
    "using a forecast ensemble one can estimate the probability distribution of future weather variables which allows probabilistic weather forecasting @xcite , where not only the future atmospheric states are predicted , but also the related uncertainty information .",
    "the ensemble prediction method was proposed by @xcite and since its first operational implementation @xcite it has become a widely used technique all over the world and the users understand more and more its merits and economic value as well . however , although e.g. the ensemble mean on average yields better forecasts of a meteorological quantity than any of the individual ensemble members , it is often the case that the ensemble is under - dispersive and in this way , uncalibrated @xcite , so that calibration is needed to account for this deficiency .",
    "the bayesian model averaging ( bma ) method for post - processing ensembles in order to calibrate them was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of bma is that for each member of the ensemble forecast there is a corresponding conditional probability density function ( pdf ) that can be interpreted as the conditional pdf of the future weather quantity provided the considered forecast is the best one .",
    "then the bma predictive pdf of the future weather quantity is the weighted sum of the individual pdfs corresponding to the ensemble members and the weights are based on the relative performance of the ensemble members during a given training period . in this way bma is a special , fixed parameter version of dynamic model averaging method developed by @xcite .",
    "the weight parameters and the parameters of the individual pdfs are estimated using linear regression and maximum likelihood ( ml ) method , where the maximum of the likelihood function is found by em algorithm . in practice",
    ", the performance of the individual ensemble members should have a clear characteristic ( and not a random one ) or if it is not the case this fact should be taken into account at the calibration process ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite",
    "the bma method was successfully applied to obtain 48 hour forecasts of surface temperature and sea level pressure in the north american pacific northwest based on the 5 members of the university of washington mesoscale ensemble @xcite .",
    "these weather quantities can be modeled by normal distributions , so the predictive pdf is a gaussian mixture .",
    "later , @xcite developed a discrete - continuous bma model for precipitation forecasting , where the discrete part corresponds to the event of no precipitation , while the cubic root of the precipitation amount ( if it is positive ) is modeled by a gamma distribution . in @xcite",
    "the bma method was used for wind speed forecasting and the component pdfs follow gamma distributions , while using von mises distribution to model angular data , @xcite introduced a bma scheme to predict surface wind direction .",
    "finally , @xcite described a bma model for wind vector forecasting , where wind vectors are modeled using bivariate normal distribution .    the bivariate normal model for wind vectors is also used in the ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) method for post - processing ensemble forecasts @xcite .",
    "the emos , introduced by @xcite for calibrating ensemble forecasts following normal distribution ( sea level pressure , temperature ) , produces a single normal pdf , where the mean and the variance depends on the ensemble members .",
    "however , the method can be extended to truncated normal distribution @xcite , too , and in this way it can be used for calibrating wind speed data .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a bma model for wind speed forecasting where the component pdfs , similarly to the emos pdf of @xcite , follow truncated normal distribution .",
    "the advantage of this model to the gamma model of @xcite is that for parameter estimation the truncated data em algorithm for gaussian mixture models @xcite can be used which works with closed formulae both in expectation ( e ) and in maximization ( m ) steps . in this way",
    "the estimation of parameters is much faster , which is a key issue in operational applications .",
    "we test our model on the ensemble forecasts of wind speed produced by the operational limited area model ensemble prediction system ( lameps ) of the hungarian meteorological service ( hms ) called aladin - huneps @xcite and compare the results obtained with the corresponding results of @xcite where for calibration the bma gamma model of @xcite was used .",
    "the aladin - huneps system of the hms covers a large part of continental europe with a horizontal resolution of 12 km and it is obtained by dynamical downscaling ( by the aladin limited area model ) of the global arpege based pearp system of mto france @xcite .",
    "the ensemble consists of 11 members , 10 initialized from perturbed initial conditions and one control member from the unperturbed analysis , implying that the ensemble contains groups of exchangeable forecasts .",
    "the data base contains 11 member ensembles of 42 hour forecasts for 10 meter wind speed ( given in m / s ) for 10 major cities in hungary ( miskolc , szombathely , gyr , budapest , debrecen , nyregyhza , nagykanizsa , pcs , kecskemt , szeged ) produced by the aladin - huneps system of the hms , together with the corresponding validating observations for the period between october 1 , 2010 and march 25 , 2011 ( 176 days , or 1760 data points ) .",
    "the forecasts are initialized at 18 utc .",
    "the data set is fairly complete since there are only two days ( 18.10.2010 and 15.02.2011 ) where three ensemble members are missing for all sites and one day ( 20.11.2010 ) when no forecasts are available .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble .",
    "this is the histogram of ranks of validating observations with respect to the corresponding ensemble forecasts computed from the ranks at all stations and over the whole verification period ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.7.2 ) .",
    "this histogram is far from the desired uniform distribution as in many cases the ensemble members either underestimate or overestimate the validating observations ( the ensemble range contains the observed wind speed in @xmath0 of the cases , while its nominal value equals @xmath1 , i.e @xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , the ensemble is under - dispersive and in this way it is uncalibrated .",
    "therefore , statistical post - processing is required to improve the forecasted probability density function .",
    "let  @xmath3  denote the ensemble forecast of a certain weather quantity  @xmath4  for a given location and time .",
    "in bma for ensemble forecasting @xcite to each ensemble member @xmath5  corresponds a component pdf  @xmath6 , where  @xmath7  is a parameter to be estimated .",
    "the bma predictive pdf of  @xmath4  is @xmath8 where the weight  @xmath9  is connected to the relative performance of the ensemble member  @xmath5  during the training period .",
    "obviously , the weights form a probability distribution and in this way they are nonnegative and  @xmath10 .",
    "bma model is valid only in the cases when the sources of the ensemble members are clearly distinguishable , as for the university of washington mesoscale ensemble @xcite .",
    "however , most of the currently used ensemble prediction systems produce ensembles where some ensemble members are statistically indistinguishable . usually , these exchangeable ensemble members are obtained with the help of perturbations of the initial conditions , which is the case for the 51 member european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ensemble @xcite or for the aladin - huneps ensemble described in section [ sec : sec2 ] .",
    "suppose we have  @xmath11  ensemble members divided into  @xmath12  exchangeable groups , where the  @xmath13th  group contains  @xmath14  ensemble members , so  @xmath15 .",
    "further , denote by  @xmath16  the @xmath17th member of the @xmath13th group .",
    "for this situation @xcite suggested to use model @xmath18 where ensemble members within a given group have the same weights , pdfs and parameters .    to simplify notations we give the results and formulae of this section for model , but their generalization to model is rather straightforward .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , for weather variables such as temperature , pressure or wind vectors bma models with normal component pdfs can be fit reasonably well .",
    "however , for modeling wind speed , which can take only nonnegative values , a skewed distribution is required .",
    "a popular candidate is the weibull distribution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xcite considers a bma model based on gamma distribution .",
    "here we follow the ideas of @xcite and @xcite and for wind speed modeling we employ a truncated normal distribution with a cut - off at zero  @xmath19  with pdf @xmath20 where  @xmath21  and  @xmath22  denote the pdf and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the standard normal distribution , respectively .",
    "the mean  @xmath23  and variance  @xmath24  of @xmath19  are @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we assume that location  @xmath26  is a linear function of the forecasted wind speed that leads to bma mixture model @xmath27 where  @xmath28  is the pdf defined by . to simplify the model , in what follows",
    "we also assume  @xmath29 .",
    "this reduces the number of parameters and makes computations easier .",
    "furthermore , the bma gamma model of @xcite , used as a reference , also operates with this restriction .",
    "continuous ranked probability score ( crps ) is the most popular scoring rule for evaluating density forecasts @xcite . given a cdf  @xmath30  and a real number  @xmath31 ,",
    "the crps is defined as @xmath32 where  @xmath4  and  @xmath33  are independent random variables with cdf @xmath34  and finite first moment .",
    "crps is a proper scoring rule which is negatively oriented , i.e. the smaller the better , and it can be reported in the same unit as the observation .",
    "now , if  @xmath35  then short calculation shows @xmath36^{-1 } \\bigg[a\\big(x-\\mu,\\sigma^2\\big )     + ( x-\\mu)\\big(\\phi\\big(\\mu/\\sigma\\big)-1\\big)- \\sigma\\varphi\\big(\\mu/\\sigma\\big)\\bigg],\\ ] ] where  @xmath37  with  @xmath38 ,  that is @xmath39    further , if  @xmath40  and @xmath41  are independent , then the pdf of  @xmath42  is @xmath43^{-1}\\ !",

    "now , using one can easily obtain the crps corresponding to the cdf @xmath47  of mixture model , namely @xmath48      parameters  @xmath49 ,  and  @xmath50  are estimated using training data consisting of ensemble members and verification observations from the preceding  @xmath51  days ( training period ) . in what follows",
    ",  @xmath52  denotes the @xmath13th ensemble member for location  @xmath53  and time  @xmath54 and by  @xmath55  we denote the corresponding validating observation .",
    "we consider three approaches which mainly differ in estimation of the parameters  @xmath56  of location .",
    "similarly to the normal bma model of @xcite we estimate location parameters @xmath57  and  @xmath58  with a linear regression of @xmath55  on  @xmath52  over the time points in the training period .",
    "we call this approach naive since it does not take into account that for truncated normal distribution  @xmath59   location  @xmath26  does not equal to the mean  @xmath23 .  however , one should remark that with the increase of  @xmath26  the correction term in decreases in an exponential rate .    to estimate weights",

    "ensemble members , validating observations and bma models are available for 146 calendar days ( on 20.11.2010 all ensemble members are missing ) .      using the ideas of @xcite we consider two different groupings of ensemble members . in the first case we have two exchangeable groups .",

    "to get them only five perturbations are calculated and then they are added to ( odd numbered members ) and subtracted from ( even numbered members ) the unperturbed initial conditions @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain the following pdf for the forecasted wind speed : @xmath100 where for weights  @xmath101 $ ]  we have @xmath102 .    in order to check the overall performance of the probabilistic forecasts ( based on models and ) in terms of a probability distribution function",
    ", the mean crps ( the average of the crps values of the predictive cdfs and corresponding validating observations taken over all locations and time points considered ) and the coverage and average widths of 66.7% and 90% central prediction intervals are computed and compared for both bma methods ( truncated normal and gamma ) and raw ensemble . in the latter case , the ensemble of forecasts corresponding to a given location and time is considered as a statistical sample , the empirical cdf of the ensemble replaces the predictive cdf and the sample quantiles are calculated according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 7 ) .",
    "we remark that the coverage of a  @xmath103  central prediction interval is the proportion of validating observations located between the lower and upper @xmath104  quantiles of the predictive distribution . for a calibrated predictive pdf",
    "this value should be around  @xmath105 .",
    "additionally , the bma and ensemble medians are considered as point forecasts , which are evaluated with the use of mean absolute errors ( mae ) and root mean square errors ( rmse ) .      to get a first insight about the calibration of bma post - processed forecasts we consider probability integral transform ( pit ) histograms .",
    "the pit is the value of the predictive cumulative distribution evaluated at the verifying observations @xcite , which is providing a good measure about the possible improvements of the under - dispersive character of the raw ensemble .",
    "the closer the histogram is to the uniform distribution , the better the calibration is . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the pit histograms corresponding to all three parameter estimating methods and to both bma models and are displayed .",
    "a comparison to the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) shows that post - processing significantly improves the statistical calibration of the forecasts .",
    "further , on the basis of significance levels of kolmogorov - smirnov tests given in table [ tab : tab1 ] , for both models and one can accept the uniformity of pit values corresponding to truncated normal bma model with full maximum likelihood parameter estimation method .",
    "however , one should remark that for the three group model mean corrected parameter estimation also yields acceptable pit values .",
    ".significance levels of kolmogorov - smirnov tests for uniformity of pit values corresponding to two- and three - group models . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we remark that mean correction step in full ml parameter estimation method seems essential .",
    "running the algorithm without it ( that is @xmath106 ) e.g. for the three group model yields smaller crps ( @xmath107 ) but larger mae and rmse values ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) and wider central prediction intervals .",
    "moreover , in this case the pit values do not fit the uniform distribution .",
    "we introduced a new bma model for post - processing ensemble forecasts of wind speed providing a predictive pdf which is a mixture of normal distributions truncated from below at zero .",
    "the model was tested on the 11 member aladin - huneps ensemble of the hms using two different bma models .",
    "one assumes two groups of exchangeable members ( control and forecasts from perturbed initial conditions ) , while the other considers three ( control and forecasts from perturbed initial conditions with positive and negative perturbations ) . for both models",
    "a 28 day training period was used and three types of parameter estimation : a naive and two more sophisticated one with mean correction and full maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the latter resulted pit values which perfectly fit the uniform distribution both for the two- and for the three - group model .",
    "the comparison of the raw ensemble and of the truncated normal bma forecasts shows that the mean crps values of bma post - processed forecasts are considerably lower than the mean crps of the raw ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the mae and rmse values of bma median forecasts are also lower than the maes and rmses of the ensemble median .",
    "the calibration of bma forecasts is nearly perfect as the coverage of the @xmath110 and @xmath111 prediction intervals are very close to the nominal levels . from the three competing parameter estimation methods the overall performance of the full ml estimation seems to be the best .",
    "compared to the performance of gamma bma model of @xcite for wind speed data investigated in @xcite one can observe that truncated normal bma post - processing yields slightly lower crps , mae and rmse values and narrower central prediction intervals .",
    "however , the great advantage of the model presented here appears in the speed of parameter estimation .",
    "the em algorithm for estimating the weights and distribution parameters of the truncated normal bma model uses closed formulae while in case of the gamma bma model a numerical optimization is required . running the ensemblebma package of r @xcite on a pc under a 64bit window 7 operating system (",
    "intel core i5 - 3470 cpu , 3.40 ghz , 4 cores , 8 gb ram ) the estimation of parameters of the three - group model e.g. for 25.03.2011 using training period of 28 calendar days , for the gamma bma model took @xmath112 seconds , while for the truncated normal with naive , mean corrected and full ml parameter estimation methods , @xmath113 s , @xmath114 s and @xmath115 s , respectively .",
    "the difference is more convincing when we perform modeling for all possible 148 calendar days .",
    "the corresponding running times were @xmath116 s for the gamma bma and @xmath117 s ,",
    "@xmath118 s and @xmath119 s for the truncated normal bma models . in this way the truncated normal bma model outperforms the traditional gamma bma model both in accuracy and calibration of forecasts and in computation time .",
