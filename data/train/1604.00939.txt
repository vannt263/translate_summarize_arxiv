    "the answer to this question is encoded in the behavior of fs and the correct behavior of fs across the bkt transition point was uncovered in @xcite : the fs develops a cusp singularity , however stays finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is in contrast to the previously seemingly established results on the divergence of the fs at the bkt transition point @xcite that were based on asymptotically exact calculations within the effective gaussian description of the xxz chain in the gapless regime @xmath260 and extending the results towards @xmath6 .",
    "here we clarify why divergence in fs appears within the gaussian approximation and show that when correcting the gaussian model by marginally irrelevant perturbations ( a necessary ingredient of the effective theory describing the bkt transition ) , the fs in the thermodynamic limit becomes finite .      since the effective gaussian model , given by eq .",

    "fs is related to the overlaps of the ground states at slightly shifted anisotropy parameters and the ground state contains information on all distances , whereas an effective approach only connects low - energy properties of the microscopic and effective models .",

    "the problem is that the mapping itself of the xxz spin-@xmath0 model to the gaussian theory becomes singular for @xmath28 .",
    "this singularity is encoded as well in the dependence of the luttinger liquid parameter on the anisotropy of the microscopic model when @xmath26 . despite the fact that perturbations to the gaussian model are marginally irrelevant and they die out in the infrared limit ( fixed - point value of @xmath268 is zero ) , and thus the fixed - point action is gaussian , they are crucial to be kept for obtaining correct correlation functions and hence for calculating the fs due to eq .",
