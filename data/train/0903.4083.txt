    "in 1867 , during the time when j. c. maxwell ( 1831 - 79 ) was publishing his electromagnetic theory , l. v. lorenz ( 1829 - 91 ) published his theory equating light vibrations with electric currents @xcite . this work is translated to modern vector notation and critiqued in @xcite .",
    "lorenz starts with kirchhoff s ohm s law expression . for scalar potentials with a finite propagation speed , he obtains delayed potentials .",
    "these potentials satisfy inhomogeneous wave equations and , when charge is conserved , the eponic lorenz condition @xcite .",
    "they are nonlocal .",
    "all their derivatives also must be inhomogeneous wave function solutions for correspondingly differentiated remote sources .",
    "since the potentials satisfy wave equations they can be augmented with homogeneous wave equation solutions .",
    "these sourceless augmentations are local .",
    "their derivatives depend only on proximate values .",
    "the composite potentials still satisfy wave equations and the lorenz condition with one and the same propagation speed .",
    "but they are no longer strictly delayed .",
    "their differential character is mixed , local and nonlocal .    in his 1867 paper ,",
    "lorenz never develops first order field equations from his potentials .",
    "in fact , until now , this has been ignored . with magnetic induction as the vector potential curl ,",
    "i obtain lorenz field equations with maxwell form .",
    "this allows lorenz delay to be fully probed . for nonlocal potentials , the fields in these equations",
    "are nonlocal also .",
    "the desirable locality can be restored as a far field approximation for systems that satisfy specific size constraints @xcite . for the augmented potentials ,",
    "the lorenz field equations incorporate fields for electric displacement and magnetic field strength by adding polarization fields .",
    "this development is presented formally in sec .",
    "[ sec : lorenz - fields ] .",
    "it shows that wave function potentials satisfying the lorenz condition assure charge conservation .",
    "thus , the form invariant lorenz condition is charge conservation .",
    "this limits potentials transformation .",

    "constants for units adjustment are set to unit value .",
    "all fields satisfy wave equations with propagation speed @xmath5 .",
    "these definitions pass the augmentation strengths to the polarizations . without strengths , the polarizations vanish when the augmentations are derived from a gauge function , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the fields satisfy maxwell form equations : +    [ eqs : fieldequations ]    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    together eqs .",
    "( [ eq : divd ] ) and ( [ eq : curlh ] ) give the condition for charge conservation@xmath21 the eq .",
    "( [ eq : augmenteddelayedlorenzcondition ] ) lorenz condition too gives this when acted on by the wave equation operator @xmath6 .",
    "fields derived from the delayed potentials can not be proportional to those derived from the potential augmentations .",
    "this means coupling normally provided by the constitutive relations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is not primal .",
    "there are three choices .",
    "first , take the relations as valid in very small space - time volumes where boundary conditions are set .",
    "second , further augment the potentials with proportional delayed potentials . then , wave function speed can be adjusted for dielectric constant @xmath24 and magnetic permeability @xmath25 by measurement .",
    "third , couple the fields by local and nonlocal fluxes . to see this , notice that the relation @xmath26 allows two energy continuity expressions to be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : curle ] ) and ( [ eq : curlh ] ) . when @xmath27 and @xmath28 are replaced by @xmath29 and @xmath30 using the expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,    [ eqs : energycontinuity ] @xmath33 + 4\\pi\\mathbf{\\mathbf{d}}\\bullet\\mathbf{\\mathbf{j}}.\\label{eq : dxhcontinuity}\\ ] ] more directly , @xmath34 + 4\\pi\\mathbf{e}\\bullet\\mathbf{\\mathbf{j}}.\\label{eq : exhcontinuity}\\ ] ]    both exist when the polarizations vanish .",
    "but when @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish , the latter vanishes and the former carries the entire flux .",
    "this coupling allows local polarization waves to emerge from a nonlocal electromagnetic field .",
    "the hertz dipole radiation solution discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : light - mechanization ] is the only extant example which exhibits this emergence .",
    "as sources go to zero the potentials become possible augmentations .",
    "so , the potential augmentations can conserve charge .",
    "these augmentations are then restrained by the lorenz condition .",
    "potentials in matter free space have not been so restrained previously . with this restraint ,",
    "the potentials describe waves that can be considered to propagate by progressively conserving charge .",
    "features are given in sec .",
    "[ sub : polarization - waves ] .",
    "there i show the polarizations will describe rays without the longitudinal fields that plague other formulations @xcite .",
    "an example with lissajous vector potential is presented in sec .",
    "[ sub : polarization - flux - localization ] . in this",
    "instance rays are real space paths determined by linearly independent potential vector component phases . with neither wave packet dispersion @xcite nor quantum mechanical nonlocality",
    ", these rays provide localization that has long eluded discovery .",
    "localization to rays is relaxed for linearly dependent component phases .",
    "as representative lorenz potential augmentations consider    [ eqs : augpotentials ]    @xmath35    @xmath36    when @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are functionally dependent only on phase factors @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , these potentials satisfy the homogeneous wave equation and the lorenz condition . since @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,    [ eqs : polarizations ]    @xmath45    @xmath46     + when the vector potential components are periodic functions they can be considered to be plane waves . unlike lorenz fields defined by nonlocal potentials , the polarizations are local functions",
    "they are orthogonal , @xmath47 , and have no longitudinal components , @xmath48 ; they carry a flux @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 when @xmath51 and travel indefinitely in a ray direction @xmath52 at speed @xmath5 without driving sources .",
    "polarization waves provide , at least , a classical solution to the @xcite duality . to see how , consider a vector potential with lissajous phases @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . though periodic components are not essential , added insight is provided by the simple form    [ eqs : expotentials ] @xmath59 when @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the lorenz condition gives @xmath63    this also satisfies the homogeneous wave equation @xmath64 .",
    "so these potentials can be taken to define the eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : pandm ] ) lorenz polarizations and flux given in the appendix .",
    "when @xmath65 for @xmath66 the phase moves on the parametric line    [ eq : exshcoords ] @xmath67/(k_{1x}k_{2y}-k_{2x}k_{1y}),\\label{eq : exshx}\\ ] ] @xmath68/(k_{1x}k_{2y}-k_{2x}k_{1y})\\label{eq : exshy}\\ ] ]    with velocity@xmath69 giving @xmath70/(k_{1x}k_{2y}-k_{2x}k_{1y})^{2}$ ] . if the flux vector were to have a component perpendicular to the phase velocity the ray would dissipate .",

    "so , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can satisfy two alternative conditions for flux and phase velocity directions to be aligned .",
    "the phase @xmath75 is a parameter that gives simple harmonic polarizations .",
    "but @xmath75 is not a wave phase factor unless @xmath76 , because it is confined to the line defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : exshcoords ] ) . as @xmath77 , the ray - like character persists .",
    "although the case for @xmath66would appear to have physical relevance in describing light - like waves , the more general case in which @xmath78 may provide a particle description for light . in this case , the phase point @xmath79 moves on a path defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : exshcoords ] ) with @xmath75 replaced by @xmath80 or @xmath81 . now , the flux has the eq .",

    "must again be applied to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "the concentrated energy bearers can be marshaled into ensembles .",
    "above , i have shown the lorenz condition can select light - like rays from electromagnetic fields .",
    "this permits light mechanism study .",
    "also , its equivalence to charge conservation limits potentials transformation .",
    "these aspects are discussed below .",
    "early last century , h. a. lorentz ( 1853 - 1928 ) made two comments on maxwell field potentials .",
    "first , the eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : eandb ] ) electric field strength and magnetic induction are unchanged in form for any gauge function , @xmath86 , that gives new potentials defined by +    [ eq : gaugetransform ]    @xmath87    and    @xmath88    gauge restraints are now widely accepted @xcite .",
    "some gauges do not even specify a gauge function .",
    "for these , a gauge function further restrains the potentials .",
    "the second comment was that eq .",
    "( [ eq : delayedlorenzcondition ] ) , dubbed the lorentz condition , causes the maxwell field potentials to satisfy the eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : potentialwaves ] ) wave equations .",
    "this is shown in @xcite .",
    "lorentz did not relate these comments .",
    "so , the lorentz condition has been treated as a gauge that can be freely changed .",
    "this freedom and wave function potential nonlocality have caused potential reality to be denied . when eq .",
    "( [ eq : delayedlorenzcondition ] ) is charge conservation , as i have shown above that it is , these comments are coupled . as charge conservation ,",
    "( [ eq : delayedlorenzcondition ] ) is a basic law . with this , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lorenz - fields ] i have shown the eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : potentialwaves ] ) wave function potentials give the eq .",
    "( [ eqs : fieldequations ] ) field equations with maxwell form .",
    "this is the second comment converse .",
    "thus , maxwell fields must always have wave function potentials .",
    "the potentials can be local , nonlocal or mixed .",
    "further , as a basic law , eq .  ( [ eq : delayedlorenzcondition ] ) can not be freely changed .    when the original potentials are sourced wave functions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gaugetransform ] ) resolve to three lorenz classes that need not have the gauge function form .",
    "first , the new potentials are not wave functions .",
    "second , the new potentials are wave functions with changed source values .",
    "third , the new potentials are wave functions with unchanged source values . in the first case",
    "the lorentz condition will not apply . then",
    ", charge will not be conserved and the potentials will not propagate with a wave speed . both must be spurned .",
    "the latter , because tests in @xcite show longitudinal electric fields to propagate with finite speed .",
    "the last two cases will conserve charge if the lorentz condition persists .",
    "this persistence will assure lorenz field equations in which charge and current density are deemed observables that produce potentials and fields yielding emergent light - like waves .",
    "these conserve charge progressively as described in sec .",
    "[ sub : polarization - waves ] .",
    "further , localized energy is conveyed on ray forming phase points as described in sec .",
    "[ sub : polarization - flux - localization ] . for gauge transformations",
    ", persistence requires the lorenz gauge , @xmath89 .",
    "it suppresses the polarizations and , thus , their dependent , emergent rays .      in the late eighteen hundreds , h. von helmholtz ( 1821 - 94 ) tried to unite electromagnetic theories @xcite . to this end",
    "he based his concept on electric and magnetic polarization . from this",
    "he obtained wave equations for a homogeneous medium .",
    "his transverse waves have speed @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the vacuum light speed . only difficult",
    ", precision measurements could complete the theory , because his longitudinal wave speed has any value greater than or equal to zero .",
    "unlike helmholtz waves , lorenz waves are simply transverse , because eq .  ( [ eq : divd ] ) gives @xmath92 .",
    "to promote his concept , helmholtz issued a challenge to measure a coupling between electromagnetism and dielectric polarization .",
    "his former student , h. hertz ( 1857 - 94 ) , later claimed the prize .",
    "he then went on to observe dipole radiation reflection and interference .",
    "based on this hertz concluded that polarization propagation is like vacuum light ( * ? ? ? * and 122 - 3 ) and @xcite .",
    "hertz s dipole field @xcite has radial , transverse wave emergence in the far field . at intermediate distances",
    "the waves have greater than light speed that approaches light speed in the far field .",
    "these waves change from longitudinal to transverse as the radial direction changes from dipole length to dipole equator .",
    "hertz reconciled these properties in the equatorial plane by observing strobed interference between free air and straight wire waves @xcite .",
    "his and recent @xcite reports suggest light structure may be open to study . antiphased fields in @xcite may represent an eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlh ] ) ampere law based , magnetoinductive internal structure @xcite .    for vacuum polarization waves eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxhcontinuity ] ) takes a simple form . by the gauss theorem",
    ", it represents an equality between the temporal energy change in a volume and the energy flux through its surface . for monochromatic waves",
    ", @xmath85 can be written using the hertz analogy as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is photon energy and @xmath95 is photon flux with coherence length inversely related to monochromaticity departure @xcite .",
    "this dependence means that the photon power density must approach zero as the coherence length becomes very large for monochromatic photons .",
    "the compact , quantum particle photon concept is untenable in this limit .",
    "the concept is further threaten by confounding photon size with wavelength .",
    "this problem is revealed by the table [ cap : some - vacuum - photon ] benchmarks . there",
    "the lowest energy photons have a wavelength greater than the earth orbit radius .",
