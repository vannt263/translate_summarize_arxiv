    "in the late stage of evolution , the low- and intermediate - mass stars lose large amount of mass and produce circumstellar shells . various dust species are present in the cold and dense shells of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , post - agb stars and planetary nebulae ( pne ) , among which silicate dust in o - rich shells and sic dust in c - rich shells are well identified through their spectral features .",
    "there are two prominent spectral features respectively peaking around 21@xmath0 and 30@xmath0 .",
    "both features are observed in circumstellar shells of c - rich stars in both the milky way and the magellanic clouds ( mc ) . so far , the 21@xmath0 feature is detected in about 18 galactic objects ( cerrigone et al .",
    "2011 ) and 9 mc objects ( volk et al .",
    "the 21@xmath0 feature is only seen in proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) , a transient phase in stellar evolution .",
    "in contrast , the 30@xmath0 feature is detected in the whole late stage of stellar evolution , from agb to post - agb to pn ( hony et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all the 21@xmath0 sources also display the 30@xmath0 emission feature as well as the so - called `` unidentified infrared ( uir ) '' emission bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath0 .",
    "the uir bands are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( lger & puget 1984 , allamandola et al .",

    "the 30@xmath3 m feature does not correlate with the 21@xmath3 m feature , implying that their carriers are not related .",
    "figure  [ fig:21vs30 ] also shows that the 21@xmath0 feature does not correlate with the uir features .",
    "this argues against large pah clusters as a possible carrier for the 21@xmath0 feature .",
    "moreover , it appears that the 30@xmath0 feature and the uir features weakly anti - correlate , suggesting that the uir carriers ( e.g. pahs ) may result from the decomposition or shattering of the 30@xmath0-feature carrier .",

    "zhang et al .  ( 2009a ) examined nine inorganic carrier candidates for the 21@xmath0 feature , including nano tic , fullerenes with ti , sis@xmath15 , doped sic , the sic and sio@xmath15 mixture , feo , fe@xmath15o@xmath16 and fe@xmath16o@xmath17 .",
    "we found that except feo nanodust , they are all problematic : they either require too much material ( i.e. , violating the abundance constraint ) or produce extra features which are not seen in astronomical objects .",
    "feo seems to be a promising candidate carrier for the 21@xmath0 feature for two reasons : ( 1 ) fe is an abundant element ; and ( 2 ) feo has a pronounced spectral feature around 21@xmath0 ( posch et al .",

    "1989 ) . for nonspherical dust ,",
    "the predicted 21@xmath0 feature is even broader .",
    "finally , to account for the power emitted from the 21@xmath0 feature in hd56126 , the feo model requires @xmath19 , exceeding the iron budget of @xmath20 available in hd56126 .",
    "therefore , feo nanodust is unlikely a valid carrier for the 21@xmath0 feature .",
    "the 30@xmath0 feature , extending from @xmath1224 to @xmath1245@xmath0 , is very strong and accounts for up to @xmath1230% of the total ir luminosity of the emitter .",
