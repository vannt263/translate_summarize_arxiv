    "in nuclear reactions two extreme types of reaction mechanisms can exist : the compound  nucleus ( cn ) and the direct ( di ) process . in the cn mechanism",
    "the projectile merges in the target nucleus and excites many degrees of freedom of the cn .",
    "the excitation proceeds by way of a multistep process and therefore has a reaction time typically of the order @xmath37s to @xmath38s . after this time the cn decays into various exit channels .",
    "the relative importance of the decay channels is determined by the branching ratios to the final states . in the di process",
    "the projectile excites only a few degrees of freedom ( e.g.  single  particle or collective ) .",
    "the excitation proceeds in one single step and has a characteristic time scale of @xmath39s to @xmath40s .",
    "this corresponds to the time it takes the projectile to pass through the target nucleus ; this time is much shorter than the reaction time of cn processes .",

    "[ 1 ] were determined with the help of the code dfold  @xcite .      in thermonuclear scenarios",
    "the projectile energy is well below the coulomb and/or centrifugal barrier .",
    "consequently , the cn formation may be suppressed , because there are almost no cn levels that can be populated , especially in light , magic and far  off  stability nuclei . in this work",
    "the theoretical cross sections are calculated by only considering the dc  contributions .",
    "the theoretical cross section @xmath45 is obtained from the dc cross section @xmath46 by  @xcite , @xcite @xmath47 the sum extends over the ground state and excited states in the final nuclei , where the spectroscopic factors @xmath48 are known . the isospin clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients are given by @xmath49 .",
    "the dc cross sections @xmath50 are essentially determined by the overlap of the scattering wave function in the entrance channel , the bound  state wave function in the exit channel and the multipole transition  operator .",
    "the radial dependence of the wave functions in the dc  integral is in our case determined uniquely by the folding potentials .",
    "in the folding approach the nuclear density @xmath41 for the stable nucleus @xmath0s was derived from the experimental charge distribution  @xcite .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath5 for @xmath0s(n,@xmath1)@xmath2s of the optical potential in the entrance channel was adjusted to fit the thermal ( @xmath0s+n)scattering cross section of ( @xmath51)barn  @xcite . even so this cross section is not determined well , we fitted our normalization factor to reproduce 1.1barn .",
    "however , applying the same fitting procedure to the ( @xmath52s+n)scattering cross section that is known much better ( ( @xmath53)barn  @xcite ) we obtained almost the same volume integral per nucleon in the two cases ( @xmath52s+n : 501.7mev@xmath54 ; @xmath0s+n : 497.1mev@xmath54 ) . the imaginary part of the optical potential is small for the ( @xmath0s+n)channel and can be neglected . for the exit channels",
    "the normalization constants @xmath5 were adjusted to the energies of the ground and the excited states .",
    "the potentials obtained in this way ensure the correct behavior of the wave functions in the nuclear exterior .",
    "the spectroscopic factors for one  nucleon stripping of @xmath2s were determined from the most recent experimental @xmath0s(d , p)@xmath2s  data  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . for these calculations the program oxbash  @xcite was used to calculate the wave functions and spectroscopic factors .",
    "the calculated spectroscopic factors are larger than those extracted from the experimental @xmath0s(d , p)@xmath2s  data ( see table  [ t1 ] )",
    ". this fact might be due to the strong truncation of the model space ( only one neutron in the pf ",

    "inclusion of more particle  hole excitations should give smaller spectroscopic factors .",

    "is compared with the experimental data from the thermal to the thermonuclear energy region in fig .",
    "there are two types of e1transitions contributing for the transitions to the residual nucleus @xmath2s .",
    "the first one comes from an s  wave in the entrance channel exciting the negative  parity states 3/2@xmath55 and 1/2@xmath56 ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "these transitions give the well  known 1/v  behavior ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the second type of e1transition comes from an initial p  wave and excites the positive  parity state 3/2@xmath57 in the final nucleus .",
    "this transition has a v  behavior and can be neglected in the relevant energy range ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the e1transition to the 7/2@xmath56ground state of @xmath2s can also be neglected , because of the higher centrifugal barrier necessary for the incoming d  wave ( see table  [ t1 ] ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] this contribution effects the deviation from an 1/v  behavior of the cross section only above about 700kev .    the spin and parity assignments of the final states in @xmath2s , the q  values for the transitions to the different final states , the spectroscopic factors obtained from @xmath0s(d , p)@xmath2s and shell  model calculations are shown in table  [ t1 ] .",

    "the enhancement in the region of 176kev comes from resonant contributions  @xcite not considered in the dc  calculation .",
    "dc is also the dominant reaction mechanism for neutron capture by neutron ",
    "rich isotopes far  off stability occurring in the @xmath3and r  process . for such isotopes",
    "the q  value and therefore the excitation energy of the compound nucleus gets still lower , leading to a further substantial diminution of the level density of the compound nucleus .",
    "thus , the dc  contribution becomes the dominating reaction mechanism .",
    "structure models are indispensable for extrapolating reaction rates to nuclei near and far  off the region of stability , because only a limited or no experimental information is available in this region .",
    "the dc cross reaction @xmath0s(n,@xmath1)@xmath2s can be considered as a benchmark of different nuclear  structure models ( shell model , relativistic mean field theory , quasi particle random phase approximation , hartree fock bogoliubov theory ) for calculating neutron ",

    "<S> at the karlsruhe pulsed 3.75mv van de graaff accelerator the @xmath0s(n,@xmath1)@xmath2s(5.05min ) cross section was measured by the fast cyclic activation technique via the 3.103mev @xmath1ray line of the @xmath2s  decay . </S>",
    "<S> samples of elemental sulfur enriched in @xmath0s by 5.933% were irradiated between two gold foils which served as capture standards . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0s(n,@xmath1)@xmath2s  cross section in the thermonuclear and thermal energy range has been calculated using the direct  capture ( dc ) model combined with the folding procedure used for the determination of the potentials . </S>",
