    "the existence of envelope autosolitons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , in homogeneous nonlinear medium with dissipation and amplification , was revealed by pereira and stenflo@xcite .",
    "they found the exact solution for autosolitons with arbitrary growth and damping strengths in the perturbed nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "later , autosolitons were discovered in nonlinear fiber optics , namely in fibers with amplifiers and distributed filters ( the latter corresponds to the frequency - dependent damping in the nonlinear schrdinger equation )  @xcite and also for waves on the surface of deep water@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) homogeneous medium with amplification and nonlinear damping , the possibility of existence of a 2d analog of the pereira - stenflo solitons was recently shown by a variational approach  @xcite .",
    "autosolitons in a weakly dispersive nonlinear media , described by the korteweg - devries equation , have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the autosolitons can be distinguished from ordinary solitons .",
    "the latter exist in conservative media and are originated from the balance between the nonlinear and dispersive effects of the wave propagation .",
    "the properties of these generated solitons are defined by the initial conditions ( their number , parameters like amplitudes , widths , etc . )",
    "@xcite , with the solutions characterized by their corresponding properties . as for to the autosolitons",
    ", they can be generated in nonconservative media when effects of amplification and dissipation are present .",
    "for the existence of autosolitons , one should add to the equilibrium condition between nonlinearity and dispersion the requirement of a balance between amplification , frequency - dependent damping and nonlinear dissipation .",
    "in distinction from ordinary solitons , the properties of the autosoliton , as a rule , are fixed by the coefficients of the perturbed nlse and by any initial perturbation that is attracted to this point ( attractor in the space of coefficients ) .",
    "mathematically , the problem is described by the nlse with complex parameters .",
    "if the imaginary parts are large , the equation is equivalent to the so - called complex ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "an interesting limit is represented by the nlse with small complex coefficients .",
    "the purpose of this article is to show that the analog of autosoliton is possible in a trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "recently the existence of bright and dark solitons in bec has been demonstrated ( see theory in @xcite ) .",
    "dark solitons have already been observed in bec with repulsive interaction between atoms @xcite . for attractive interactions ,",
    "bright solitons exist in 1d bec .",
    "it is well known that two- and three - dimensional condensates with attractive interaction between atoms and trapping potential are unstable if the number of atoms exceeds the critical value ( @xmath1 ) . below this value",
    "a stable ground state can exist , corresponding to solitary solutions @xcite .",
    "when the number of atoms exceeds @xmath1 the collapse occurs . at large densities",
    "the inelastic scattering processes involving two and three atoms come into play , leading to the effective nonlinear damping of the condensate .",
    "the process of feeding atoms from the thermal cloud can be modeled as a linear amplification described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relevance of the three - body inelastic processes was discussed .",
    "the statistical data obtained from experiments with @xmath2li supports the growing and collapse picture @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the 3d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation are performed in refs .",
    "the present work shows that periodic oscillations occur in the condensate and , for particular values of atomic feeding and three - body dissipation parameters , stable states of the cloud can exist .",
    "thus , we can expect the occurrence of analog autosolitons in 2d and 3d becs .",
    "the problem is described by the complex ginzburg - landau equation with trapping potential in the nlse limit with small nonconservative perturbations .",
    "this equation is nonintegrable and , therefore , analytical solutions can only be obtained by considering approximate methods like the variational approach @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we first use the time - dependent variational approach to obtain the solutions .",
    "as showed previously , the time - dependent variational approach is quite effective to study the dynamics of 3d bec in trapping potential with conservative perturbations @xcite .",
    "these autosoliton solutions can be considered as the nonlinear modes of such system like solitons for the integrable nlse @xcite .",
    "exact numerical simulations are also performed in the present work , which confirms that , in the present case , the variational approach is a convenient and reliable approximation .",
    "let us describe the dynamics of a trapped bose - einstein condensate in the framework of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the space - time dynamics of the condensate wavefunction can be analyzed by the gp equation in the mean field approximation : @xmath3 where we use a standard simplified notation for the time derivative through a lower index @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the trap harmonic potential ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the two and three body interaction parameters , where @xmath8 is given by the @xmath9- wave atomic scattering length . @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are positive defined coefficients related , respectively , to feeding , dipolar relaxation and three - body inelastic recombination parameters .",

    "if @xmath10 is decreased ( or @xmath11 increased ) , the system will eventually achieve a stable region where the formation of autosoliton is possible .",
    "we did a series of time - dependent simulations of the system within the gaussian variational approach , using eq.([sys1 ] ) , and also by performing exact numerical calculations with eq.([gp ] ) . in our numerical calculations",
    ", we have used the finite - difference crank - nicolson algorithm .",
    "the exact initial wave functions were used following the prescription given in @xcite . in the next , we present simulations in a range of parameters that lead to long - time stable autosolitons .",

    "the formation of the autosoliton is demonstrated either by gaussian variational approach or by exact numerical calculations .",
    "there is a remarkable agreement between both approaches .",

    "the remarkable agreement between both approaches , already observed in case that @xmath87 ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , also apply to this case that @xmath90 , with the number of atoms not depending on the initial conditions .    in @xmath0li experiment",
    "the feeding parameter can be indirectly inferred from measurements done by the rice group @xcite and will correspond to an average rate of about 600 atoms / s @xcite .",
    "the two- and three - body losses were also measured @xcite and estimated  @xcite , giving atom loss rates of about @xmath91@xmath92/s and @xmath93@xmath94/s .",

    ", we have for condensed atoms @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "considering this magnitudes , the autosoliton can possibly be observed experimentally in @xmath0li , either by results with decreasing @xmath10 due to losses , or by increasing the dissipation rate due to other mechanism as the feshbach resonances@xcite . in case of diminishing @xmath10 ,",
    "the autosoliton formation is more likely determined by dipolar relaxation rather than three - body recombination losses .",
    "in this work we study the possibility of existence of autosolitons in trapped 3d bec in the presence of two- and three - body inelastic processes : dipolar relaxation and three - body recombination . using the time - dependent variational approach for nonconservative 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ,",
    "we derive expressions for the parameters of autosoliton and check their stability .",
    "the results obtained by using the present time - dependent gaussian variational approach , in the nlse with atomic feeding and nonlinear dissipative terms , show a remarkable agreement with exact numerical calculations , when the parameters were such that stabilization was achieved .",
    "we should note that , stabilization can also be numerically observed in the model given in ref.@xcite , where @xmath10 is decreased in time , but their parameters are far from the realistic ones , and dipolar relaxation was neglected .",
    "such stabilization verified in ref.@xcite has not been recognized as a manifestation of autosoliton , a characterization that we are pointing out in the present work .",
    "we have shown that the transition from unstable ( collapsing ) to stable point ( autosoliton ) solely depends on the magnitude of the parameters .",
    "also the present work include non negligible two - body dissipative effects that model the dipolar relaxation losses , and that can be associated with values measured in ultracold @xmath0li@xcite . in case of decreasing @xmath10 due to collapsing and losses , the autosoliton is more likely to be formed first due to dipolar relaxation rather than by three - body recombination processes . these results can be relevant in current experiments with attractive scattering length and possibly display new phenomenon of pereira - stenflo type autosoliton formation in bose condensates .",
    "we believe that such phenomenon is already occurring in the long time behavior in the actual experiments with @xmath0li @xcite ( @xmath98 140hz ) , since for longer times ( @xmath9960s ) the maximum number of atoms ( @xmath100 1300 atoms ) is considerably reduced , as expected in our simulations .",
    "we hope that experiments with direct observation of the evolution of the condensate can clarify this matter .",
