    "the production of four pions in @xmath0 annihilation and in @xmath1 decays is interesting in its own right but it also represents a non - negligible component of hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "in fact , almost 5 @xmath3 of the lowest - order hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath4 is due to four pions @xcite . at the level of accuracy required for",
    "a comparison of the standard model prediction for @xmath4 with the recent bnl measurement @xcite , better knowledge of this contribution would be welcome ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the determination of the fine structure",
    "constant at @xmath5 , the relative importance of the four - pion contribution is even bigger but in this case the available precision is sufficient for the time being .    in this talk , i report on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite where we have constructed the relevant amplitudes up to invariant four - pion masses of about 1 gev .",
    "this is not enough for the purpose of calculating @xmath4 , but it is a first step in this direction . even if it is impossible to calculate the amplitudes directly from",
    "qcd our aim was to construct amplitudes that are at least consistent with qcd .",
    "this program turned out to have some surprises in store .",
    "the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite starts from a calculation to next - to - leading order in the low - energy expansion of qcd , employing the methods of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding low - energy amplitudes can not be used directly in the physical region because the four - pion threshold of 560 mev is already close to the resonance region .",
    "but the low - energy amplitudes contain nontrivial information how to continue to higher energies . at next - to - leading order ,",
    "the traces of @xmath6 and scalar meson exchange appear in the amplitudes .",
    "supplemented by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and double @xmath6 exchange , the resulting @xmath9 cross sections describe the available experimental data very well up to cms energies of about 1 gev .",
    "there are altogether four different channels accessible in @xmath0 annihilation and @xmath1 decays into four pions . in the isospin limit that we assume throughout , the amplitudes of either @xmath10 @xcite or @xmath11 @xcite are sufficient to determine all four amplitudes .",
    "one important advantage of the chiral approach is that not only chiral symmetry but also charge conjugation invariance , bose symmetry and electromagnetic gauge invariance are manifest at each stage of the calculation .    .",
    "solid lines denote pions and the wavy line stands for the virtual photon.,width=264 ]    at leading order in the low - energy expansion , the amplitude is completely determined by `` virtual '' bremsstrahlung . from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] , the matrix element of the electromagnetic current governing the amplitude for @xmath10 is found to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 92.4 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "this matrix element has a very suggestive structure : @xmath16 is the ( lowest - order ) scattering amplitude for @xmath17 and the second term reduces to the usual bremsstrahlung factor for real photons ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "although the amplitude ( [ eq : tree ] ) is by itself not of direct phenomenological relevance we can use the isospin relations @xcite and calculate also the leading - order @xmath1 decay amplitudes . in the chiral limit ( @xmath19 )",
    ", those amplitudes should coincide with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , there are two ( identical ) misprints in ref .",
    "@xcite that have moreover propagated into some of the subsequent literature ( @xcite and references therein ) . although the structure is correct , the normalization is not : the correct amplitude ( [ eq : tree ] ) and the corresponding @xmath1 decay amplitudes are smaller by a factor @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 in rate ) .",
    "this normalization error also affects the so - called cleo current @xcite in the monte carlo package tauola @xcite .    the `` current algebra '' amplitude ( [ eq : tree ] ) is important for checking the low - energy limit of qcd but it is not a realistic approximation in the physical region . in order to see the traces of meson resonance exchange , we have to go at least to next - to - leading order .",
    "at next - to - leading order in the chiral expansion , the amplitude consists of two parts : a loop amplitude @xcite and a tree amplitude containing the ( renormalized ) coupling constants of the chiral lagrangian of @xmath22 @xcite . with the standard values of those constants ,",
    "one arrives at cross sections that are still unrealistic . as indicated by the dotted curves in figs .  2,3 , the theoretical cross sections are significantly smaller than the measured ones .",
    "the seeds of meson resonance exchange appear first in the coupling constants of @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , those constants are known to be saturated by meson resonance exchange to a large extent @xcite .",
    "this saturation makes the matching between the strictly chiral amplitude to @xmath22 and a more realistic meson resonance exchange amplitude almost trivial . using the standard chiral resonance lagrangian @xcite ,",
    "the resonance amplitudes are guaranteed to exhibit the correct low - energy behaviour to @xmath22 .    in four - pion production ,",
    "only the @xmath6 and the ( isoscalar ) scalar mesons contribute at @xmath22 .",
    "as could have been expected , @xmath6 exchange dominates by far . the overall contribution from",
    "scalar exchange turns out to be very small so that the controversial structure of the scalar sector is not relevant in practice .",
    "the modified amplitudes with @xmath6 and scalar exchange are definitely more realistic than the chiral low - energy amplitudes . however , except in the vicinity of the @xmath6 pole , the resulting cross sections are still too small ( not shown in figs .",
    "the obvious lesson is that important ingredients of the amplitudes are still missing that only show up at orders @xmath23 or higher in the chiral expansion .",
    "the most important missing degrees of freedom are easily found : both quantum number considerations and experimental information @xcite indicate that @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchange must be incorporated . whereas the lowest - order coupling of the @xmath7 to pions is unique , there is some ambiguity in the @xmath24 couplings ( to be resolved eventually by studies of three - pion production @xcite ) . with a simplifying assumption for those couplings @xcite , including double @xmath6 exchange that also comes in at @xmath25 and performing a resummation of some terms making up the @xmath6-dominated pion form factor ,",
    "the amplitudes assume their final form . except for the ambiguity in the @xmath24 couplings ,",
    "all resonance couplings can be determined from the respective decay widths .",
    "the two main assets of our amplitudes are :    * they contain the relevant degrees of freedom for describing four - pion production up to energies of about 1 gev .",
    "* they exhibit the correct low - energy behaviour to @xmath22 by construction .    for energies below 1 gev , annihilation data are available for the channel @xmath26 mainly . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the theoretical cross sections are compared with the most recent ( and most precise ) data from the cmd-2 collaboration @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the full data set ) . the cross section for our model",
    "is shown as the full curve .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to omitting the loop amplitude of @xmath22 @xcite ( except for the contribution to the width of the @xmath6 meson ) .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that the amplitude is completely dominated by resonance exchange .",
    "although a possible enhancement of the cross section in the region between 800 and 900 mev could not be explained with our amplitude the gross features of the data can be reproduced over a range of two orders of magnitude with almost no free parameters .",
    "in retrospect , the simplifying assumption for the @xmath24 couplings ( that actually has a theoretical basis @xcite ) is justified by comparison with experiment : other choices for the couplings could not reproduce the data .",
    "note that @xmath7 exchange does not contribute in this channel : the cross section near 1 gev is completely dominated by @xmath8 exchange .",
    "the experimental situation is less satisfactory for the other annihilation channel @xmath27 .",
    "the most precise experiment @xcite has measured the cross section at only two energies below 1.05 gev .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment is shown in fig .",
    "the loop contribution is even less relevant in this case .",
    "the theoretical cross section increases by three orders of magnitude from the @xmath6 resonance to match the two data points . for this channel ,",
    "the cross section near 1 gev is dominated by @xmath7 exchange .",
    "the theoretical prediction is therefore less sensitive to assumptions about the @xmath24 couplings .",
    "our amplitudes and the corresponding cross sections can not be extended to the phenomenologically most interesting region above 1 gev without further input .",
    "the reason is that the amplitudes do not satisfy the high - energy constraints of qcd .",
    "in fact , the theoretical cross sections exceed the data soon above 1 gev of cms energy",
    ". additional higher - mass states must be included to access the region up to 2 gev and to ensure a proper high - energy behaviour .",
    "resummations similar to the pion form factor may also be necessary .     with data @xcite :",
    "complete cross section ( full curve ) , without loop contributions ( dashed curve ) , cross section for the amplitude of @xmath22 ( dotted curve).,width=283 ]    [ fig : cc ]     @xcite.,width=283 ]    [ fig : nc ]    from our amplitudes we can also extract the branching ratios for the four - pion decay modes of the @xmath28 . for @xmath29 several contributions to the amplitudes",
    "are of comparable size , with partly destructive interference . in this way",
    ", uncertainties in the resonance couplings are enhanced .",
    "we therefore quote predictions for the branching ratios with a 40 @xmath3 uncertainty : @xmath30 for comparison , the particle data group @xcite lists @xmath31",
    "the following features of our model for four - pion production are worth repeating :    * the amplitudes exhibit the correct low - energy structure to @xmath22 in the chiral expansion . *",
    "all symmetries of the transitions are manifest in the qft framework of chpt : ( broken ) chiral symmetry , gauge invariance , bose symmetry and charge conjugation . * in addition to @xmath6 ( and the less important scalar ) exchange , @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchange are crucial for understanding the experimental results already at energies below 1 gev . * good agreement with available data is obtained , covering several orders of magnitude in cross sections . * to extend the amplitudes to energies above 1 gev , the correct high - energy behaviour still needs to be implemented . for the same reason , comparison with @xmath1 decay data is postponed .",
