    "microscopic understanding of nuclear collective dynamics is a long - term goal of low - energy nuclear theory . large amplitude collective motion ( lacm ) , as seen in fission and fusion , provides a particularly important challenge .",
    "those phenomena can be understood in terms of many - body tunneling involving the mixing of mean fields with different symmetries .",
    "we have yet to obtain a microscopic understanding of lacm that is comparable to what we have for ground states , excited states , and response functions .    for heavy , complex nuclei ,",
    "the theoretical tool of choice is the self - consistent nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of dft is that , while treating the nucleus as a many - body system of fermions , it provides an avenue for identifying the essential collective degrees of freedom and provides an excellent starting point for time - dependent extensions .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) theory appears , in principle , to provide a proper theoretical framework to describe the lacm .",
    "however , the main drawback of tdhfb , when applied to fission , is its inability to describe the quantum - mechanical motion under the collective barrier .    on the other hand , the adiabatic approximation to tdhfb ( atdhfb ) has been successfully applied to the lacm @xcite .",
    "the main assumption behind atdhfb , well fulfilled in the context of spontaneous fission , is that the collective motion of the system is slow compared to the single - particle motion of individual nucleons @xcite .",
    "according to the path formulation of the fission problem @xcite , atdhfb provides the best framework to tackle the problem of nuclear dynamics under the barrier .",
    "another advantage of atdhfb is that it provides a connection between the microscopic many - body theory and phenomenological models based on collective shape variables .",
    "the main theoretical input for an estimate of fission half - lives is collective inertia ( mass tensor ) and collective potential .",
    "atdhfb provides the best framework to calculate mass tensor @xcite .",
    "however , in most applications , various approximations are adopted . in the commonly used cranking expression , for instance",
    ", the derivatives with respect to collective coordinates ( i.e. , collective momenta ) are evaluated using the perturbation theory , and the thouless - valatin self - consistent terms yielding time - odd fields are neglected .",
    "the resulting collective masses are known to be too small @xcite ; hence it is imperative to go beyond the perturbative cranking treatment .    in the self - consistent investigations of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the gogny energy density functional , collective masses were calculated by explicitly evaluating the collective - coordinate derivatives appearing in the atdhfb mass expression .",
    "the resulting collective mass obtained in such an approach turned out to exhibit appreciable variations along the collective path , suppressed in the perturbative cranking treatment .",
    "furthermore , they noted that atdhfb cranking mass could be an order of magnitude greater than the perturbative cranking mass .",

    "<S> illustrative calculations are carried out for one - dimensional quadrupole fission pathways in @xmath0fm . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the collective mass exhibits strong variations with the quadrupole collective coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> these variations are related to the changes in the intrinsic shell structure . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between collective inertia obtained in cranking and perturbative cranking approximations to atdhfb , and within goa , are discussed . </S>"
