    "in the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions ( sm ) , the fermions acquire mass by interacting with the higgs field , which is also assumed to be responsible for the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry . at the lhc",
    ", the sm higgs boson is expected to be produced mainly via the gluon fusion although the vector boson fusion production will also play a significant role . for a higgs with",
    "a mass of 120  gev , the corresponding production cross sections are @xmath1  pb and @xmath2  pb .    the lep2 experiments ruled out a sm higgs boson lighter than 114 gev ( at 95% confidence level ) , whereas the current precision electroweak measurements indicate that the mass of the sm higgs should be lower than about 154  gev ( 95%  c.l . )  @xcite . despite its low branching ratio of about 0.002 in this region of interest",
    ", the @xmath0 decay channel will provide an exceptionally clean final - state topology due to the presence of two energetic photons . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath0 decays are expected to provide one of most promising signatures for a discovery with the cms detector at lhc .",
    "the event selection requires two photon candidates with a @xmath3  gev each .",
    "the dominant backgrounds consist of 1 ) the irreducible background coming from the direct diphoton production ( @xmath4  pb ) , and 2 ) the reducible backgrounds from @xmath5 ( @xmath6  pb ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8  pb ) . the signal rate is thus rather small compared to backgrounds . to suppress contributions from the reducible background processes , both photon candidates are required to be well isolated , both in the tracker and in the hadron and electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the reconstructed @xmath9 invariant mass for @xmath10  gev and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "made of about 76,000 pbwo@xmath12 crystals , the cms ecal is one of the best calorimeters in high - energy physics , designed to give cms a superior discovery potential for the higgs in the critical low - mass range .",
    "the target energy resolution of @xmath13 for electrons and photons with an energy above about @xmath14  gev has been successfully achieved in several test beam studies . as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , precise , in situ calibration and monitoring of the ecal response will be crucial for a clean reconstruction of the @xmath0 signal .",
    "this task will be accomplished using a dedicated laser monitoring system and calibrations with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 decays and the `` @xmath18-invariance '' method  @xcite .",
    "to improve the search sensitivity , the selected events are split into categories based on the compactness of photon showers and the pseudo - rapidity of the photon candidates .",
    "this allows us to take advantage of better mass resolution when we expect it , yet still use all of the selected events .",
    "the confidence levels are then computed by using the log likelihood ratio frequentistic method  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that for @xmath19  gev this `` cut - based '' approach should lead to a @xmath20 discovery with less than 30  fb@xmath21 of integrated luminosity .",
    "moreover , if the higgs boson will be discovered in this channel , we will be able to measure its mass with a statistical precision of @xmath22 , already with about 30  fb@xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , approximately 5  fb@xmath21 are needed for a 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion in the same mass range if the sm higgs boson does not exist in that mass range .    a different search strategy , referred to as the `` optimized analysis , '' consists in using a neural net to discriminate between the signal and background .",
    "photon isolation and event kinematics variables are used as inputs .",
    "signal significance is derived using the neural net output and reconstructed diphoton invariant mass .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the mass distribution after a cut on the neural net output at 0.85 , for @xmath23  gev .",
    "the optimized analysis should lead to a significantly better discovery potential . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig:2 ] , for @xmath19  gev the @xmath0 signal should be discovered with about 10  fb@xmath21  @xcite .      establishing @xmath24 production via vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) will be crucial for understanding the exact nature of the higgs mechanism .",
    "such events will be characterized by the presence of two back - to - back high - rapidity jets .",
    "therefore , the forward jet tagging should result in a clean separation of the vbf signal from the gluon fusion signal and the majority of backgrounds . for @xmath19  gev",
    ", a @xmath20 discovery of the @xmath0 vbf signal can be achieved with about @xmath25  fb@xmath21 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "with a standard cut - based analysis with less than 30  fb@xmath21 of integrated luminosity we can discover the sm higgs boson with @xmath20 significance between the lep lower limit and 140 gev .",
    "a significantly better discovery potential can be achieved using an optimized analysis , for which only about 10  fb@xmath21 will be needed to establish the @xmath0 signal .",
    "the detector resolution for the reconstructed higgs boson mass profits from the excellent energy resolution of the cms crystal calorimeter .",
