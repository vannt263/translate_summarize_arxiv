    "radio galaxies are a class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) spouting powerful radio jets whose axis is not aligned along the line of sight . while the formation mechanism of relativistic jets is not fully understood , it must be closely related to mass accretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "in fact , studies of galactic black holes have revealed that the relative power of the jets to accretion critically depends on the state of the accretion disk , which is predominantly determined by the mass accretion rate . for agns ,",
    "however , detailed studies of accretion disk state in relation to the jet formation are still limited .",
    "broad band observation of nearby , bright radio galaxies hence give us ideal opportunities to unveil this problem , because , unlike `` blazars '' , the innermost disk can be well observable in the x - ray band with much smaller contribution from the jet emission .",
    "4c 50.55 ( igr j21247 + 5058 ) is a fanaroff - riley type ii broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) , discovered by _",
    "integral _ in its first survey catalogue @xcite .",
    "the source is also detected in the first 9 months data of _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) survey of agns @xcite .",
    "though being the brightest blrg in the hard x - ray sky above 10 kev , 4c 50.55 , located at @xmath6 , had been unrecognized as a bright x - ray source until the _ integral _ and _ swift _ era , due to the obscuration by the galactic plane .",
    "this source is also of great interest for understanding the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes at high fractions of eddington luminosity , which is estimated to be @xmath7 ( see section  [ differ_sed ] ) .",
    "@xcite determined the redshift to be @xmath8 based on the detection of a broad h@xmath9 emission line in the optical spectrum . from the observed flux densities at 1.4 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) , @xcite estimate the inclination angle to be @xmath10 , assuming a lorentz factor of @xmath11 and a typical power ratio between the core and total known for radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the inferred viewing geometry of the nucleus is well consistent with the classification of 4c 50.55 as a blrg .",
    "the initial results on the x - ray spectra are reported by @xcite , who used the _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift_/xrt data combined with a time - averaged _ integral _ spectrum .",
    "they find that the spectra below 10 kev are apparently hard , and complex , multiple layers of absorber are required .",
    "iron - k features are not significantly detected and the strength of reflection components , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the solid angle of the reflector , is not tightly constrained ( @xmath14 ) . in this paper , we present the first simultaneous broad band x - ray data of 4c 50.55 observed with _",

    "the xiss and hxd - pin covers the 0.212 kev and 1070 kev , respectively . since agns are time variable , the simultaneous coverage is critical for studying the continuum shape over the broad band , in particular to accurately constrain the compton reflection component .",
    "moreover , the _ suzaku _ exposure is quite deep ( a net exposure of @xmath15 100 ksec ) , and thus provides us with the best quality dataset so far obtained from this source .",

    "figure  [ curve_s ] shows the x - ray light curves obtained with the xis - fis ( 210 kev , _ upper _ ) and with the hxd / pin ( 1540 kev , _ middle _ ) , and their hardness ratio ( pin / xis , _ lower _ ) .",
    "the zero point of time corresponds to the start time of the _ suzaku _ observation .",
    "the xis light curve in the 210 kev band indicates a rapid flux increase by @xmath33 in the last 20 ksec exposure .",
    "the time scale of this variability is @xmath34 sec , indicating that the emission region is within @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the gravitational radius ) for a black hole mass of @xmath37 ( see section  [ differ_sed ] ) . by contrast , the light curve in the 1540 kev band does not show evidence for significant variability above the statistical errors in the same epoch .",
    "thus , there is a hint for decrease in the hardness ratio between the pin and xis , although its significance is marginal . for the following spectral analysis , we separate the observation period into two , epoch  1 ( 01.4@xmath38 sec ) and epoch  2 ( 1.4@xmath381.7@xmath38 sec ) .            we analyze the _ suzaku _ spectra of epoch  1 and epoch  2 separately , by performing simultaneous fit to those of the xis - fis in the 19 kev band , the xis - bi in the 18 kev band , and the hxd / pin in the 1260 kev band .",
    "given the fact that the spectrum of 4c 50.55 is subject to a heavy galactic absorption , we do not utilize the xis - bi data below 1 kev to avoid any possible uncertainties in the response .",
    "we find that the effects of pile - up are significant above 9.0 kev for the xis data .",
    "further , we discard the xis data of the 1.71.9 kev band because of calibration uncertainties associated with the instrumental si - k edge . in the simultaneous fit ,",
    "the flux normalizations for the xis - fis and xis - bi are set free , while that of the pin is fixed at 1.18 relative to that of the xis - fis @xcite .",
    "we firstly apply a single power law model ( modified by the galactic absorption fixed at @xmath16@xmath39 ) to the xis and pin data in epoch  1 , covering the 160 kev band .",
    "the fit is found to be far from acceptable ( @xmath40 ) and results in a very flat slope , @xmath41 .",
    "this is because the spectral shape below 10 kev is much harder than that above 10 kev .",
    "next we apply a cut - off power law model , in the form of @xmath42 , over which a narrow gaussian is added to represent an iron - k emission line at 6.4 kev .",
    "we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 kev with @xmath45 .",
    "there remain strong absorption features around 1 kev suggesting intrinsic absorption , however .",
    "when we add another absorption at the source redshift ( @xmath46 ) , the fit becomes much better , yielding @xmath47 , @xmath48 kev , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "finally , similar to the analysis done by @xcite , we consider double absorber model with two different column densities , @xmath51  and @xmath52 , whose covering fraction is @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . the fit is significantly improved ( @xmath55 ) with @xmath56 , @xmath57 kev , @xmath51@xmath58 , @xmath52@xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the photon index becomes a reasonable value for agns .",
    "note that our `` double absorber '' model has three free parameters for the absorber , while the `` double partial covering '' model ( * `` pcf*pcf * '' * in the xspec terminology ) adopted by @xcite has four .",
    "since the latter model does not give a significant improvement for our data ( @xmath61 ) , we adopt the former as a base continuum model for the following analysis .",
    "the high quality _ suzaku _ spectra are quite useful to constrain the reflection component , which is indicated by the presence of the iron - k emission line .",
    "thus , we include it by utilizing our modified version of `` pexriv '' reflection code @xcite that assumes a cutoff power law continuum and contains a self - consistent fluorescence iron - k line calculated according to the same algorithm as described in @xcite .",
    "the additional free parameter is the relative reflection strength , @xmath62 , while we fix the ionization parameter , temperature , and inclination angle at 0 , @xmath63 k , and 35 degrees @xcite , respectively",
    ". the solar fe abundance by @xcite ( fe / h = @xmath64 ) is assumed .",
    "considering that the reflection most likely occurs in the accretion disk , we smear both reflected continuum and iron - k emission line by the * `` diskline '' * kernel @xcite .",
    "the innermost radius @xmath65 is set as a free parameter by assuming an emissivity law of @xmath66 for a fixed outer radius @xmath67 . when constraining @xmath65 , we utilize only the xis spectra around the iron - k band ( 39 kev for the xis - fis and 38 kev for the xis - bi ) and fix all the other parameters except for the normalization .",
    "thus , the spectral fit is performed by iteration ; after @xmath65 is determined from the xis - only fit , it is then fixed when finally determining the continuum parameters in the xis+pin fit .",

    "swift_/bat ( @xmath179 erg @xmath18 s@xmath22 ) . the large long - term variability in the hard x - ray above 10 kev suggests that it is mainly produced by the intrinsic emission , not purely by the change of the absorber as discussed by @xcite in the frame work of a `` patch torus '' model @xcite . while there remains a possibility that compton thick absorber ( @xmath180 @xmath18 ) may completely cover a part of the emission region to cause the flux variability , it would produce signals of heavy obscuration such as a deep iron - k edge feature in the x - ray spectra , which are not seen in the data .",
    "thus , at least variability of the continuum flux is required to explain these results , while that of the absorber can also contribute to the variability , in particular below 10 kev ( ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for ngc  1365 ) .",
    "we significantly detect an iron - k emission line and obtain a tight constraint on the reflection component , even though it is quite weak as reported by @xcite . the reflection strength",
    ", @xmath181 is much smaller compared with seyfert 1 galaxies , which typically have @xmath182 @xcite . even correcting for a variability effect that the direct continuum flux was higher in our observations by a factor of @xmath1361.4 than the 22-months average , the reflection is still small , @xmath183 .",
    "the weak reflection is also consistent with the narrow iron - k emission line , which indicates that the reflection is mainly produced by relatively outer parts of the disk ( hence with a small solid angle ) , unlike the results from typical seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "our 4c  50.55 result confirms the trend reported by @xcite for radio loud agns .",
    "the analysis of the iron - k line profile yields an ( apparently ) large innermost radius , @xmath184 , by assuming an emissivity law of @xmath66 .",
    "our diskline result suggests it unlikely that a `` standard disk '' extends down to close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the black hole , @xmath115 6 @xmath112 .",
    "instead , it is possible that the disk is there but its inner part is covered by an optically thick corona , as estimated by our comptonization model fit , which would smear out relativistic iron - k broad lines .",
    "note that the obtained @xmath65 value does not directly mean that the disk is truncated at that radius , because ( 1 ) the estimated @xmath65 critically depends on the emissivity profile and ( 2 ) there may be another line component from distant parts , such as the torus .",
    "if the scale height of the x - ray irradiating corona is sufficiently small , then one would expect a flatter slope for the emissivity law , even close to @xmath185 . in this extreme case",
    ", we were not able to obtain good constraints on @xmath65 from our data . to examine the second possibility",
    ", we apply a two - components line model to the xis 39 kev spectra , consisting of a narrow gaussian at 6.4 kev and a broad diskline , which represents that from the torus and disk , respectively .",
    "we obtain a worse fit than the single diskline fit by @xmath186 even with a larger degrees of freedom , suggesting that the two components model is not a good description of the data .",
    "nevertheless , when @xmath65 of the disk line component is fixed at 10 @xmath112 as found from 3c  120 @xcite , both lines are found to be significant with equivalent widths of 19@xmath187 ev and 24@xmath18815 ev , respectively .",
    "thus , we do not completely exclude the possibility for the presence of a moderately broadened iron - k line in the observed spectra of 4c  50.55 .",
    "the inferred geometry of the accretion disk in 4c  50.55 ( i.e. , truncated and/or inner parts covered by corona ) may be common features of agns with powerful jets .",
    "recent _ suzaku _ studies indicate that radio galaxies also have relatively narrow iron - k emission lines e.g. , @xmath189 20 @xmath112 for 3c 390.3 @xcite and @xmath190 44 @xmath112 for 4c + 74.26 @xcite from the single diskline fit , and @xmath191 for 3c 120 from the multiple components fit @xcite .",
    "this result is in accordance with an expectation from theories that jets are more easily produced by radiatively inefficient accretion flow than by a standard disk .",
    "another key parameter to understand the accretion flow is the eddington ratio , which is estimated to be @xmath192 for 4c 50.55 ( section  [ differ_sed ] ) .",
    "similarly , we also estimate that of 3c  120 to be @xmath193 , using the 210 kev flux @xcite and the black hole mass of @xmath194  @xcite .",
    "thus , these two sources may belong to a very similar class of agns , except for the radio loudness to the x - ray flux ( log @xmath161 for 3c  120 and log @xmath195 for 4c  50.55 ) , which could be partially explained by the small inclination angle of 3c  120 ( @xmath196 ; see @xcite ) compared with 4c  50.55 ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the physical reason for the difference in their x - ray spectra that the reflection component and iron - k lines are stronger in 3c  120 ( @xmath198 ) is not clear at present .",
    "4c 50.55 and 3c  120 are rare objects having distinctively high fractions of eddington luminosity compared with other typical blrgs , for instance , @xmath199 = 0.010.07 for 3c 390.3 @xcite , @xmath200 for 4c  + 74.26 @xcite , and 0.0010.002 for arp 102b @xcite .",
    "by analogy to the galactic black holes , these low eddington ratio sources likely correspond to the low / hard state , where the accretion disk is accompanied by steady jets , while normal seyfert galaxies may do to the high / soft state , where the disk extends close to the isco with quenched jet activity .",
    "the accretion flows in 4c  50.55 and 3c  120 could be explained as a high luminosity end of the low / hard state .",
    "alternatively , they may be another state achieved with even higher mass accretion rates than in the high / soft state , where the disk structure is also similar to that found in the low / hard state ( i.e. , truncated disk ) .",
    "for this possibility , it is interesting to note the similarly to the high - eddington ratio galactic black hole grs  1915 + 105 , which exhibits a similarly narrow iron - k emission line over a comptonization dominated continuum , implying that the inner disk is fully covered by a corona @xcite ; in grs  1915 + 105 , a compact jet is also detected in a steady state with a hard spectrum , so - called in class  @xmath110 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in summary , the unified picture of accretion flows over a wide range of black hole mass is far from established .",
    "further systematic studies of the accretion disk structure of radio loud agns at various accretion rates based on detailed x - ray spectroscopy and multi - wavelengths data are very important to reveal these fundamental problems .",
    "we thank gerry skinner for providing the _ swift_/bat light curve of 4c  50.55 , and the _ suzaku _ team for the calibration of the instruments .",
