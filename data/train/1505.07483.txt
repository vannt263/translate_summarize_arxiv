    "the lyman alpha ( ) emission line of atomic hydrogen ( ) is intrinsically the most luminous spectral emission feature in astrophysical nebulae .",
    "it is produced by the spontaneous decay from the first excited state to the ground state ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the principle quantum number ) , where the energy difference between the levels dictates a photon energy of 10.2  ev , or wavelength @xmath7   .",
    "after the capture of an electron in ionized gas , the transition probabilities of the following radiative cascade are such that 68% of recombinations involve the production of a  photon @xcite .",
    "thus if all ionizing photons had an energy slightly above the ionization edge of , @xmath8% of the total ionizing energy would be reprocessed into the  line . because the line may be intrinsically so luminous ,  was initially proposed as the spectral beacon by which to identify the first generations of primeval galaxies almost five decades ago @xcite .",
    "plays a pivotal role in contemporary astrophysics , where it is used to identify high - redshift ( @xmath9 ) star - forming galaxies by either narrowband filter observations or spectroscopic techniques , and frequently to confirm the redshift of candidate galaxies selected by other methods . indeed",
    "the recognition that  observations have attained makes the detection of  a primary science goal for many new instruments on large telescopes : first light has recently been seen by hypersuprime cam ( hsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the subaru telescope , the multi unit spectroscopic explorer ( muse , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at eso s very large telescope , and the cosmic web imager ( cwi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at palomar",
    ". furthermore , the hobby eberly dark energy experiment ( hetdex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will find on the order of @xmath10  galaxies , and  detection is among the science goals for spectroscopic instruments on the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and all plans for extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "the above introductory paragraphs on  production are incomplete .",
    "while  forms in astrophysical nebulae at the stated intensities , the transition is a resonant one , and  is also absorbed by  in the same transition .",
    "after absorption to the @xmath11 level ( in the absence of electron collisions ) , there is is no alternative but for the electron to de - excite through .",
    "the optical depth of , as seen in the core of the absorption line , is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the temperature of the gas and  the column density in @xcite .",
    "thus at the limiting temperatures to which hydrogen can remain neutral ,  becomes optically thick to  at @xmath14  .",
    "assuming a number density of 1 atom per cubic cm , a cloud will exceed @xmath15 when its diameter exceeds @xmath16",
    "pc , or just 2 au . taking the milky way as an example , there are very few sightlines through which  drops below @xmath17  @xcite , implying that would almost always see upwards of @xmath10 optical depths .",
    "the upshot is that in most galaxies ,  undergoes a radiative transfer process : photons scatter until they either escape from the galaxy or are absorbed by a dust grain , and dust extinction is also strongest in the far uv .",
    "this transfer may be thought of as a diffusion - like process , where photons take random walks in both physical and frequency space @xcite .",
    "the path taken by  is entirely regulated by the distribution of  that it encounters and must traverse , which in turn determines the likelihood that will encounter dust . fortunately  may see a significantly lower optical depth if it is shifted in frequency or the  is moving ; the former can occur either after many scattering events as it diffuses in frequency through the redistribution profile , or by scattering in  that is itself kinematically offset from the  media where the  formed .",
    "ultimately the emitted  luminosity ( also its ew and departure from intrinsic /  ratio of 8.7 ) will be a function of  distribution , gas kinematics , dust content , and galaxy viewing angle .",
    "transfer makes it hard to interpret the observed  flux and ew from an individual galaxy , because the escape fraction , , is difficult to predict for given configuration .",
    "however the transfer process , and the sensitivity of  to different ism properties , is also one of the major advantages of the transition .",

    "@xmath18 _ the evolution of galaxies . _",
    "the fraction of galaxies with  @xmath1  ( the canonical definition of a -emitter , lae ) , at absolute uv magnitudes brighter than 18 , is just 5% in the nearby universe",
    "@xcite , where laes are rare .",
    "however this fraction increases strongly with increasing redshift , to @xmath19% at @xmath20 @xcite to over 50% at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "evolves even more strongly over the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "this monotonic evolution , that spans a factor of 100 in , is a key result of many  surveys but has no conclusive explanation .",
    "dust and  covering have both been suggested , and the answer must indeed lie among the quantities mentioned above , or combinations thereof , in the co - evolving properties of stars , gas and dust .",
    "@xmath18 _ the epoch of reionization .",
    "_  emission offers a unique opportunity to study the ionization state of intergalactic medium ( igm ) at an epoch where other methods  e.g. the gunn - peterson trough in qso spectra and thompson scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  are insensitive . the  emitter fraction and  evolution discussed above reverses after @xmath22 , decreasing to @xmath23% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath24 .",
    "possible interpretations include an increase in the ionizing photon escape fraction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which is anyway needed for reionization ) , but also that and increasingly neutral igm starts to absorb the  produced by the galaxies themselves .",
    "disentangling the scenarios requires more information and solid constraints on the reionization history and topology require much larger samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these will become available in the coming years with hsc . moreover , as the igm becomes neutral , the damping wing of  absorption may begin to affect the profile shape of the  line that is transmitted , giving  another unique application .",

    "_  scatters coherently in the restframe of the  atom , and at scattering events is shifted in frequency by the velocity of the scattering medium .",
    "thus as  may escape from galaxies because of frequency shifts , the kinematic structure of the atomic gas becomes imprinted onto the line .",
    "this manifests as both a redshift ( for outflowing gas ) of the centroid of the main emission peak ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also as characteristic features that modify the shape of the line profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while there are many probes of kinematics in astrophysics , nebular line kinematics exclusively traces the warm ionized medium .",

    "@xmath18 _ atomic gas surrounding galaxies . _ as well as modifying the line profile , scattering also changes the surface brightness profile of emitted @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms by which galaxies obtain the gas they need to fuel star formation is one of the most pressing issues in extragalactic science ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and necessitates a knowledge of the  distribution outside of star - forming regions and into the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) . probing this",
    "circumgalactic  is observationally very challenging . in principle",
    "it can be done by @xmath25  cm observations of  directly , but current telescopes can not push such techniques beyond the very local universe . an alternative is to use absorption spectroscopy of background qsos that pierce galaxy halos at different impact factors , enabling us to measure  temperatures , densities and kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately appropriately bright qsos are rare and thus studies , while rich with information , are limited to statistical studies of the average galaxy .",
    "a promising third method is to illuminate the circumgalactic  with produced in the central star - forming regions . indeed  is perfect for such an application ,",
    "being both the brightest intrinsic emission line , and being resonant in precisely the medium we need in order to image the cgm .",
    "section  [ sect : intro : key ] presents the main astrophysical applications of  emission , both as a diagnostic of the galaxies themselves and the igm . the key difficulties of observing high-@xmath9 galaxies",
    "are that fluxes are low and high signal - to - noise data are hard to obtain , that spatial information is minimal or absent , and that important features are redshifted away from atmospheric transmission windows . in the local universe surface brightness is higher by a factor of @xmath26 , and spatial sampling can become almost arbitrarily high .",
    "moreover , only in the local universe can we assemble the complete set of multi - wavelength observations , including but not limited to , all the continuum bands that probe both hot and cold stars , emission lines that provide a wealth of intrinsic diagnostics of the nebulae in which  forms , direct measurements of far infrared continuum for both hot and cold dust , direct  measurements at @xmath25  cm , x - ray observations of coronal gas , and many more .",
    "indeed the science objectives discussed in section  [ sect : intro : key ] can , with the exception of reionization , all be undertaken in the low-@xmath9 universe . here",

    "this makes  an import observable to obtain in any thorough study of ( particularly star - forming ) local galaxies .",
    "moreover the question can be inverted : when as much information on the dust and gas content ( distribution , kinematics , etc ) has been assembled , observations of  can then be used to calibrate our understanding of the  transport mechanisms , and the effects of dust , gas , star - formation evolutionary stage may all be disentangled .",
    "this is the way , for example , we will assemble the relevant knowledge to interpret the evolution of the fraction with redshift . in turn",

    "local  observations will allow us to read kinematic information off the line profile and conversely to predict the flux , ew , and line profile shapes , precisely as needed to address topics such as cosmic reionization that really hinge upon knowing the spectral profile .",
    "indeed this is one of the major legacies established by our ultraviolet satellites ; the only difficulties are that such satellites are both expensive and competitive .",
    "this review focuses mainly upon empirical studies of  emission and absorption in star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "somewhat arbitrarily , i have defined the ` local universe ' to mean redshifts where space - based facilities are needed to observe . in principle",
    "this means @xmath28 or so , but the most distant samples discussed are at @xmath29 , and thus we are considering roughly the latter half of cosmic time . where appropriate i may concentrate upon what about galaxies teach us about , or about what  teaches us about galaxies .",
    "the layout of the remainder is as follows : + @xmath18 in section  [ sect : prehistory ] i present a brief history of observations in the local universe , which were ongoing at a time when the first generations of high-@xmath9 searches were also beginning .",
    "this concerns the first vacuum uv observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star - forming galaxies using low dispersion spectrographs .",
    "+ @xmath18 in section  [ sect : hstspec ] we discuss how the _ hubble space telescope _ changed the landscape by providing high - resolution spectra that can resolve the  feature and interstellar absorption lines , thereby probing atomic gas kinematics and covering .",

    "+ @xmath18 in section  [ sect : govprop ]",
    "i then synthesize all the observational data from the previous sections , and introduce some more speculative discussion about how various processes fit together .",
    "+ @xmath18 finally i do not present explicit conclusions , but close the review in section  [ sect : conc ] with a number of perspectives and pressing open questions .",
    "these are concerned future observations and uses of  at both low- and intermediate-@xmath9 , with a view to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "the literature makes use of several observable quantities that pertain to , that often are specific to how much escapes or aim to illustrate how ` strong ' the feature is .",

    "is mainly produced by recombinations in photoionized nebulae , where under standard case b assumptions 68% of ionizing photons absorbed by hydrogen are reprocessed into  in the following radiative cascade ( see @xcite for an intuitive explanation )",
    ". for continuously star - forming galaxies , with constant star formation rate ( sfr ) , the equivalent width ( ew ) ranges between @xmath30 .",
    "for very young systems the ew peaks around 300  @xcite , while very high ews that exceed 1000    may in principle be expected for very low metallicity , population iii stellar systems @xcite .",
    "naturally if the sfr is declining the intrinsic  ew may take any value less than these , and it is worth noting that for a simple stellar population ( ssp ) ,  exceeds 20  only during the first 6  myr @xcite .",
    "measuring the flux and ew of most emission lines is straightforward .",
    "however for  this is not necessarily so and these quantities may depend upon both methodology and definition . as a resonant transition ,",
    "both nebular  and continuum radiation with wavelength @xmath31    may be absorbed by .",
    "depending upon the column density , this absorption may reach equivalent widths of several tens of  , which is a substantial fraction of the nebular flux .",
    "fluxes measured in a given aperture may or may not be reduced by this amount .",
    "narrowband imaging , for example , needs to be continuum - subtracted and therefore measures the sum of nebular emission and absorption .",
    "spectroscopic observations , on the other hand , may enable the observer to isolate the components and separate nebular emission from ism absorption , should this be the goal of the measurement .",
    "however even with in spectroscopic mode isolating the emission - only flux depends upon the spectral resolution , and the separation will be much easier with high - resolution slit spectrographs than low - resolution survey telescopes .    not only is  absorbed in the ism but also , depending on temperature and the properties of their winds , in the atmospheres of stars .",
    "for the hottest o stars  ews may be negligible , but as the population ages or the star formation rate declines , the dominant source of uv continuum will shift to progressively cooler stars .",
    "@xcite showed that  measurements from some local galaxies may be subject to significant uncertainties from stellar absorption , and recent models by @xcite demonstrate that stellar  absorption may reach ews of @xmath32   .",
    "for example , the effect of stellar absorption may also vary from o - star dominated systems where the nebular ew is high and the stellar feature is negligible , to later b - star systems where the reverse is true .",
    "the stellar feature may therefore shorten the timescale over which an episode of star - formation remains bright in , and the effect may even be seen on resolved scales within a galaxy .",
    "equivalent widths have the advantage that only a short range in wavelength is needed to make the measurement , over which the effects of interstellar dust ( reddening curve , total extinction ) should have a negligible effect .",
    "as discussed above , the evolutionary phase of star formation dominates the intrinsic ew .",
    "/balmer line ratios , however , may also be used as a measure of the strength of , and because the intrinsic ratios are limited to a narrow range of values , have other advantages .",
    "for example the  line ( @xmath33 ) is a well - known , calibrated tracer of current star - formation activity in nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for case b nebulae at temperatures in the range 5,00020,000  k and electron density in the range @xmath34@xmath35  @xmath36 , the /ratio ranges between 8.1 and 11.6 @xcite .",
    "thus deviations from the intrinsic line ratios encode information about the  scattering and dust absorption .",
    "while different authors do tend to adopt slightly different values , the range of permitted values is relatively narrow . for this review",
    "we will adopt the value of /@xmath37 , which for @xmath38  k gas corresponds to @xmath39  @xmath36 , and as a convention can be traced back to at least @xcite .",
    "frequently we make reference to the  escape fraction ( ) , in an effort to find a quantity that most closely reflects the combined impact that gas and dust have on suppressing the emission line .",
    "we define  as the ratio of the emitted  luminosity to that intrinsically produced , but naturally a number of assumptions can enter our estimates of the intrinsic value .",
    "the most robust estimates of  will naturally come from comparing  with other hydrogen recombination lines , where in practice  is the strongest and easiest to observe . assuming that  is unobscured",
    ",  will simply be the observed /  ratio divided by its intrinsic case b value ( 8.7 as mentioned above ) .",
    "of course  can also be significantly absorbed by dust , and in local ` normal ' galaxies suffers about 1 magnitude of extinction on average @xcite .",
    "obviously redder hydrogen lines would be better as they suffer less extinction but also become systematically weaker in flux , and become harder to observe in the near infrared .",
    "radio recombination lines would be optimal , suffering no extinction at all , but are even more challenging to observe beyond the very local universe .",
    "thus often the best route to  is to dust - correct  using the  line , which should recover all the star formation down to moderate optical depths @xcite .",
    "however when  becomes very optically thick , in very dusty star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even dust - corrected  traces only a small fraction of the true ionized gas , making the inferred escape fraction prone to strong biases . in such instances ,",
    "one may do better by comparing the -derived sfr with that estimated from dust emission in the fir , under the assumption that systematic errors on the sfr calibrations are smaller than the fraction of  that is recoverable . in the highest optical depth regimes this is probably true .",
    "the major contributing observatories in this field are just three : the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , and the _ galaxy evolution explorer _",
    "( galex ) , while piecemeal observations have been contributed by other telescopes .",
    "restframe fuv observations began with the iue in 1977 , hst started operation just 13 years later and is still returning  data at @xmath40 some 25 years on ; the demarcation between history and present is arbitrary of course .",
    "for the sake of this review , i will adopt the pre - hst era , which is almost exclusively the iue and thus is also restricted by method to spectrophotometry of pre - selected targets . in the ` modern ' era we then have two main operational tools .",
    "firstly hst , which like iue performs pointed observations of individual targets , but in doing so yields data that are always rich with features since both spatial and spectral resolutions are significantly higher .",
    "secondly , the galex satellite is similar to the iue in resolving power but its strength comes instead from its 1.2 degree field of view , which provided the survey efficiency to yield the statistical significance that was not available at low-@xmath9 with any other telescope .",
    "even before iue some extragalactic objects were observed with sounding rocket experiments , which were able to launch small uv telescopes above enough of the atmosphere to observe in the uv . specifically targeting the first known quasar 3c273",
    ", rocket payloads provided the first measurement of  and balmer emission lines from any astrophysical body @xcite . combining",
    "the measured  flux with optical measurements revealed a /  ratio of 4 , a measurement that then sat in stark contrast to the value of @xmath41 that was expected for nebular recombinations and a  enhancement from collisions . in 1977",

    "today  observations play a major role in understanding the interstellar and circumgalactic media of galaxies at effectively all redshifts .",
    "the 1978 launch of iue opened up the restframe uv to systematic study .",
    "iue had a single 20@xmath4310  entrance aperture and _ short _ and _ long - wavelength prime _ channels ( swp and lwp , respectively ) that could provide @xmath44 spectroscopy between 1150 and 3000  .",
    "first observations were again turned to qsos and various seyfert galaxies , and immediately showed  to be weaker than expected for recombination theory , with /  and /  values almost never falling along characteristic reddening curves , and  always being preferentially suppressed @xcite .",
    "interpretations varied , with suggestions that multiple scatterings of  could be responsible , that broad - line regions experience a wide variation in their extinction laws , ionization / excitation from already - excited states , and that there may be no representative intrinsic spectral shape for seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed @xcite concluded that the low observed  fluxes were likely the result of a combination of reddening , high densities , and high  optical depth .",
    "all these effects conspire in the same direction but as no single dominant quantities could be identified , it started to become clear that transfer in true astrophysical objects is a complicated multi - parametric process .",
    "when iue was first turned to star - forming galaxies , the results directly mirrored those obtained in both nearby qsos and also those being reported from high-@xmath9 blind narrowband and spectroscopic surveys ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review , and the forthcoming pasa review in this series by s. malhotra ) :  was either absent or unexpectedly weak in all galaxies .    with the intent of studying the analogues of primeval galaxies at high-@xmath9 , @xcite found  in emission from just one of three nearby -selected galaxies , and in that single case with a flux well below that expected for the nebular dust content ( figure  [ fig : mt81 ] ) .",
    "this led them to conclude that under normal conditions ,  emission would be an unlikely phenomenon .",
    "it was determined that if a normal prescription for dust attenuation were used to explain the /  ratio , this would greatly over - predict the /  ratio compared to observation .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite , who furthered the discussion , showing how a mixed medium of  and dust could preferentially suppress , and that static  columns of density above @xmath45  would be needed to reconcile the line ratios .",
    "further , they raised the issue that , where 21  cm data are available , most blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) are found to sit inside extended  halos of sufficient column density to reproduce the measured fluxes .",
    "all signs pointed towards the fact  emission would not be the good observational beacon to identify primeval galaxies in the early universe that @xcite had predicted .     and a metallicity of @xmath46 .",
    "at the wavelength of @xmath47 , the galaxy shows only a  absorption feature .",
    "the _ lower _ panel shows a very different object  c1543 + 0907 , with a redshift of @xmath48 and metallicity of 1/10 the solar value . at the wavelength of @xmath49",

    "was discovered @xcite , seemingly confirming the prediction .",
    "however the spread on the relation was worryingly large , and it was clear that something beyond variations in the extinction law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were behind the wide range of line ratios , with ism geometry and holes being the most often cited scenarios .",
    "@xcite performed a full reanalysis of the iue archival data , resulting in several changes .",
    "firstly the iue data reduction software reached a higher level of maturity , and new spectral extraction and cosmic - ray removal tools were implemented : this reduced the measured  significantly in about half the sample , and completely removed the weak  feature that had been reported in some galaxies . secondly , these authors performed proper spatial matching between the iue and apertures used for optical line spectroscopy .",
    "when the homogenized reanalysis was complete , both the  and /balmer line ratios showed no significant correlation with nebular dust attenuation or the uv continuum colour ( @xmath51 ) , and only a weak but significant correlation with nebular oxygen abundance .",
    "results concerning the /  line ratios can be seen figure  [ fig : gia96 ] .",
    "regarding these correlations , it is not clear why  throughput should be more strongly correlated with oxygen abundance than nebular attenuation .",
    "metals alone do not absorb , which can only happen by interaction with dust grains .",
    "thus if the @xmath50 anti - correlation results from a positive correlation between metal and dust abundance , then a tighter correlation between /  and  would be expected .",
    "this correlation is completely absent .",
    "furthermore , when the dust reddening measured from the balmer decrement is used to correct the observed  for extinction , the  flux does not reach the expected case b recombination value in a single galaxy in the iue sample .",
    "this demonstrates that either some preferential attenuation of  must be at play in every galaxy , or / and that dust attenuation laws , when applied as a screen of absorbing material , are not representative .",
    "when interpreting these analyses of the iue samples , it is important to keep in mind the selection functions by which the individual samples were established . when effective telescope areas are small and exposure times need to be long , the result is small samples .",
    "some of the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) and  galaxy studies were designed to study the analogues to ` primeval ' galaxies that are undergoing their first phase of star - formation , and the samples did not include galaxies with strong starbursting nuclei @xcite . yet the primeval stages of galaxy formation , prior to the initial dust and metal production , are expected to be short - lived because the first generations of supernovae will enrich the local ism on timescales of just a few myr .",
    "consequently the bulk of the galaxy population we can observe in the high redshift universe is likely to be significantly more metal - enriched than that of primeval galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "secondly , the absorption centroid of  is blue - shifted by @xmath70  relative to the systemic frame of rest of the galaxy .",
    "the result of this first resolved observation of a emission line is an asymmetric profile that comprises a blue absorption component and a red emission peak , similar to the  profile .",
    "even though the wing of the absorption profile is quite extended , the velocity offset is sufficient to shift the neutral medium partially out of resonance with , and enable some of the  radiation to escape .",
    "the lis lines intrinsic to haro2 were also found to be blue - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity and by the same velocity as measured from the  absorption ( @xmath70  ) .",
    "the peak of the  emission , however , is instead redshifted by 350  , or roughly twice the blueshift of the neutral medium .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that much of the  is able to avoid  absorption in haro2 because it does not see the atomic gas as static , and the redshifted  emission supports a picture in which the that is emitted is ` backscattered ' from a receding shell of  gas @xcite .",
    "furthermore in haro2 , diffuse soft x - ray emission covers and extends beyond the uv - bright , star - forming regions , which is produced by the mechanical energy released by the star formation episode @xcite .",

    "more compelling evidence for a causal association comes from the fact that all the  emission lines in the sample show -like asymmetric profiles , indicating that photons are interacting directly in the outflowing medium . for this",

    "galaxies in the @xcite sample were originally chosen to span a range of metallicities and dust contents , but both of these quantities were found to be secondary in governing  emission / absorption when compared to the presence / absence of outflowing neutral gas .",

    "however while there is clearly gas that does not have a velocity shift , the centroids of the absorption profiles are offset  usually by @xmath79   which demonstrates that there is fast - moving gas that can doppler shift  out of resonance with the static material .",
    "additional support for this comes from the fact that the peak of the  profile is redshifted in every case .",

    "note , however , that this does not mean it is the case that all galaxies with a strong outflow are  emitters  clearly there are galaxies with @xmath83  and  below 2   .",
    "furthermore while the correlation exists , the causal mechanism by which feedback affects the transport has not necessarily been established .",
    "for example , whether feedback is simply shifting the  out of resonance by scattering from bulk - flowing gas , or the instigation of fluid instabilities that disrupt the ism .",
    "in addition to gas kinematics , the plethora of resonance absorption lines in the uv also provide a proxy for the fractional covering of the cold  medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the principle is simple : strong resonance transitions are assumed to be saturated at normal metallicities and column densities , and thus if the absorbing line does not drop to the level of zero intensity then the observation hints that there may be multiple clouds inside the spectroscopic aperture that do not fully cover the stellar sources of continuum radiation that lie beneath .",
    "thus if there are direct sightlines between the observer and the ionized regions ,  may escape unimpeded , and importantly , without frequency shift . indeed if scattering could be completely mitigated and dust confined to the cold gas phase ,  should be at least @xmath84 , where  is the  covering fraction .",
    "these methods have been used to place indirect limits on the escape of ionizing radiation from starburst galaxies @xcite , and have recently been verified by direct observations in the ionizing continuum with hst / cos @xcite .",

    "very well exposed continuum observations are needed to solve for covering fraction , but solutions include the possibility of @xmath86 for the thickest gas neutral columns in -emitting galaxies but not in the case of absorbing systems .    many of the resonant uv transitions , including the  discussed above , have an associated fluorescent transition at longer wavelength , denoted with a * ( e.g. * ) , that provide additional diagnostics of the atomic medium @xcite . since the absorption lines are resonant , they may be partially filled by scattered radiation , very similarly to . however , the fluorescent transition associated with each line has a roughly similar einstein @xmath87 coefficient to the resonant de - excitation , which implies that roughly half of absorbed photons should be emitted in the longer wavelength * line at every scattering . in a symmetric , energy - conserving system without losses , absorption along the sightline",

    "further information may be inferred from the profiles of . while  and @xmath85 have cross sections of the same order of magnitude and become optically think at similar column density , the metal abundances imply that  may be absorbed by gas that is not visible to metal absorption . particularly in the galaxies of @xcite and lars14",

    "are hst spectroscopic studies are performed in small apertures or narrow slits . even for the most distant objects discussed so far , the 2.5 arcsec entrance window of cos corresponds to a physical size of just 6  kpc , and obviously the apertures will sample much smaller scales in more nearby galaxies ( e.g. just 130  pc in ) .",
    "thus while providing a very rich picture about  and the ism , spectroscopic measurements are restricted to the chosen sightlines : as shown in figure  [ fig : cosuvlya ] , these will sample only a fraction of the galaxies .",

    "in other regions jets of brighter  fuzz are visible , again seeming uncorrelated with obvious signs of  production such as  emission .",

    "results inferred from small - aperture spectroscopic observations will be a strong function of both the size and placement of the aperture .    in ,  produced in knots a and b may still be emitted , and all the observation can say is that more radiation from the stellar continuum is absorbed locally than the sum of directly emitted  and any  scattered into the line - of - sight . thus for a given pixel we still can not say whether  is scattered and absorbed by dust locally , or whether it propagates some kpc and contributes to the halo emission . remarkably in this three - region decomposition of , is that the strongly emitting knot c is also the dustiest , and shows @xmath96 magnitudes , while knot a in particular is far less extinguished @xcite . under the simplistic assumption that dust plays a dominant role in regulating  visibility , this would be unexpected , although results from these  absorbing knots are reminiscent of the dwarf galaxies discussed in section  [ sect : hstspec ] .",

    "however , because of galex s wide field - of - view and the large continuous wavelength range provided by slitless spectroscopy , the cosmic volumes probed are in fact rather large , and covering several @xmath10  comoving .",
    "thus while the individual parameters in the schechter function may not be very tightly constrained , the small number of galaxies is certainly because of the relative paucity of laes at lower redshifts .",

    "thus whatever process is turning -emitters off it does not affect the shape of the remaining ew distribution ( i.e. galaxies with  @xmath1 ) .",
    "of course the equivalent width distribution of the overall population changes significantly , as many galaxies drop below the canonical 20  limit ; the higher ew tail of the distribution remains largely constant .",

    "@xcite argue instead for a scenario that requires no such preservational scattering , but is still built upon a clumpy dust distribution ( which may anyway follow the cold gas ) .",
    "this model does not require clumps to act as mirrors to  and nor does it predict  ew to rise with .",
    "similarly @xcite point out that a galaxy is likely made up of many  regions with a large variety of optical depths and since we see only down to an optical depth of 1 at each wavelength , observed radiation in each line ( and continuum ) comes from regions of different sizes . at the dusty end of the galaxy distribution these latter two scenarios do not require any scattering at all , and indeed recently @xcite have shown that significant emission can be detected from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , from which it most likely escapes through holes in the ism .",

    "* ) , and at lower stellar age and mass .",
    "considering the well - known mass - metallicity relationship @xcite , it equally well explains why laes should be more prevalent at lower metallicities .",

    "if this dust were distributed purely as a screen surrounding the star - forming regions , the apparent over - luminous  observed in some laes can not be explained without severely modifying extinction laws .  would have to see at least the expected attenuation , plus an excess of absorption because of scattering .",

    "however such a dust geometry can not make high a /ratio , which saturates for optically thick nebulae at @xmath147 .",
    "what can explain the simultaneous high /  and /  ratios is a clumpy distribution of dust , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "this model , originally implemented by @xcite and @xcite , assumes dust to be distributed in dense clumps and the effective attenuation law changes significantly with the average number of clumps along the line - of - sight .",
    "e.g. again without scattering , varying @xmath151 within 10 clumps may produce /@xmath153 with /@xmath68 , and can explain the line ratios seen in the dustiest local laes .",
    "the fact that  is seen at all from local ulirgs @xcite also suggests that  must find paths of low dust optical depth .",
    "then we need to explain why the local dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , ) centrally absorb at  despite their very low dust contents .",
    "indeed hst spectroscopy shows some absorption component in every object observed , demonstrating that  has effects that range between small dips and very broad , damped absorption features .",
    "@xcite presented an evolutionary sequence for the  spectral profile expected from a star cluster ( assuming an ssp ) .",
    "this model assumes that during the earliest stages of a cluster s evolution ( @xmath154  myr ) local  absorption would be expected because the surrounding medium is completely static . over the subsequent",

    "the application of this model to dwarf galaxies suggests that their star - formation episodes may be too young and that feedback has not yet had time to accelerate the neutral ism @xcite .",
    "this scenario is probably an over - simplistic representation of whole galaxies , where stars form in different regions over extended timescales , but nevertheless the qualitative arguments may be helpful in understanding the influence of galaxy winds .",
    "all the observed line profiles , including those of the local dwarf galaxies , can in principle be unified within such a scenario @xcite . in the complete literature of low-@xmath9 galaxies",
    "only one example shows symmetric  emission without an obvious absorption component ( tol1214277 , * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , several major questions still remain to be answered .",
    "this closing section is dedicated to outlining a handful of the most pressing questions that , while perhaps challenging , can be addressed within current samples , or with possible extensions with present - day facilities .",
    "the spatial distribution of emitted and absorbed  must reflect some set of properties of the  gas .",
    "in very nearby galaxies , 21  cm observations have already revealed the structure of the cold atomic gas where , for example , the _  nearby galaxy survey _",
    "( things , @xcite ) and vla - angst @xcite surveys have found an atomic medium that is largely inhomogeneous and clumpy .",
    "it is clear that if  photons were injected in these galaxies they would experience more scattering in some regions than others .",
    "examining at least these 21  cm observations , we see that the  does not much resemble the shells and slabs in which many radiation transfer calculations are done . in order to empirically determine the effects that and its distribution have on  emission requires resolved observations of individual targets in both  and .",
    "currently we may contrast average  surface brightness profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) with those of the intensity at 21  cm ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these samples show both  and 21  cm intensity profiles that are best fit with srsic profiles that are close to exponential ( @xmath156 ) , while uv / optical wavelengths in the lars sample show significantly higher srsic indices ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "does the  surface brightness trace the gas column density ?",
    "while curious , this may be entirely coincidental as the sample selection is very different in the two cases . such observations established in the same galaxies",
    "would be enormously instructive in interpreting the  halos of both galaxies at low and high redshifts .",
    "it is unfortunate that resolutions attainable in 21  cm and in the uv / optical are not well matched ; sampling small physical scales at 21  cm requires very local galaxies , while the redshift requirements to observe  imply targets must lie beyond several tens of mpc .",
    "progress has been made by @xcite and @xcite , but with synthesized beam sizes of @xmath115  arcsec in the best case ( usually much coarser ) , such  observations can place only two resolution elements inside the linear size of the acs / sbc camera .",
    "however vla in configurations b and a can provide resolutions down to around 4 and 1.3 arcsec , respectively , albeit with a substantial increase in observing time .",
    "observational programmes at higher resolution ( vla c and b configurations ) are ongoing , but it is clear that large steps forward may be taken if observations are pushed to the highest spatial resolutions , and such observations are now essential .",
    "the total integrated  profile of a galaxy is built by emission from different regions , likely with differing kinematics , orientation , and with different contributions to the total .",
    "the spectral profiles of measured in small apertures tend to be , with radiation absorbed from the blue and re - radiated in the red . in these small apertures ,",
    "escape fractions are also low .",
    "however imaging tells us that these photons are often not expunged from the system , but scattered back into the line of sight at different position , where large - aperture photometry measures significantly higher .",
    "it is an unfortunately common feature of absorption spectroscopy that we rarely know the line - of - sight distance between the emitting sources and the absorbing gas .",
    "ideally we would like to know where the frequency redistribution of occurs , and whether the halo emission shares a similar profile to that of the more central regions where the starburst is located .",
    "for example if frequency redistribution occurs close to ionizing clusters and  is singly scattered at large radii , the profile may indeed be similar over large distances .",
    "however if photons also get caught for many scatterings in halo gas then a new kinematic structure may be encoded in the , or double - peaked profiles may be seen .    to resolve this",
    "we may take high resolution spectra of the diffuse -emitting regions in galaxy halos .",
    "these observations would be best supported by aperture - matched optical spectroscopy of  or , to tightly constrain the rest velocity distribution of , and ideally also the highest possible resolution 21  cm observations ( previous section ) . the best tool for this would be hst / stis with narrow slits , which could provide resolutions of around 20  , but again at the cost of long integrations in faint regions .",
    "@xcite have shown that in , the blue wing of the profile sets on at a similar wavelength over at least 10  kpc , suggesting the star forming regions are surrounded by a  medium that may be rather homogeneous in both space and velocity .",
    "however 21  cm observations find gas at much larger radii , where  has not yet been spectroscopically detected ; whether the profile bends smoothly and traces the edge of a bubble , and how this effect may vary in different galaxies are all currently unknown .",
    "section  [ sect : galexprop ] discusses the effect of a large number of galaxy properties on the emission of .",
    "many have been studied over time , but largely overlooked has been the effect of ionization state of the ism . specifically ionizing radiation from stars may not only produce recombination nebulae but also heat the diffuse warm medium . thus as well as producing , the further propagation of lyc radiation may increase the ionization levels of the diffuse gas , lowering the optical depth of the  regions to lyman radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that the ism of galaxies may be very inhomogeneous , and that  may be absorbed close the nebulae in which it forms , the propagation of ionizing radiation could potentially have a large impact upon the first stages of  transfer .",
    "the ionization parameter ( the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons per atom ) governs the excitation of the gas , which is usually quantified observationally by the excitation parameter ( an emission line ratio that contrasts high and low ionization species ) .",
    "this is done most effectively by taking ratios of @xmath158 and @xmath159 ions : @xcite performed ` ionization parameter mapping ' of several local starbursts using the [ ] @xmath160/[]@xmath161 ratio , to identify highly ionized cones that could signpost lyc emission .",
    "similar integrated measurements of ` green pea ' galaxies found high [ ] @xmath149/[]@xmath162 ratios @xcite that implies high ionization states , and indeed these galaxies have been found to be high - ew  emitters ( @xcite ; henry et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "currently we do not know how these highly ionized regions affect  on small scales in the ism .",
    "resolved  imaging has now been obtained for over 50 galaxies with acs , but as yet the ionization structure has only been mapped in one of them .",
    "@xcite used vlt / muse observations of [ ] and [ ] to map the ionization parameter and gas kinematics in , and compare with the  imaging from @xcite .",
    "two outflowing and highly - ionized conical regions are revealed , that approximately align with the brightest  regions .",
    "this would be consistent with a scenario in which  may propagate with less scattering through these highly ionized regions , but the observations of one system can not establish a causal relation , and a large sample of similar observations needs to be obtained .",
    "pertinent observational questions include whether  emission is systematically enhanced in regions of high [ ] / [ ] , or whether chimneys through the ism may feed brighter regions of  emission in extended halos .      given the importance of  observations at both low and high redshift ( see section  [ sect : intro : key ] ) , a vital question becomes whether we can predict the  escape fraction , equivalent width , or line profile from a given set of quantities .",
    "i.e. if we are given a dust content , a characteristic velocity for outflowing atomic gas , etc , do our predictions for  emission / absorption match reality ?    given the absence of strong correlations involving  ( for example in figure  [ fig : globtrends ] ) , one may be tempted to conclude that our understanding is not this sophisticated .",
    "however if , on the other hand , the  that we observe is governed by geometrical considerations such as viewing angle , then averaged over many galaxies the answer may be more encouraging . for example it has been shown that transfer models inside homogeneous shells can reproduce very wide ranges of line profiles @xcite , similar to those that are observed globally at high-@xmath9 ; furthermore when coupled with semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , such models are able to reproduce the broad features of the  lf over a wide range of redshift @xcite .",
    "this may imply that our more general picture of transport is correct .",
    "it is not clear whether current samples are sufficiently large , or span a high enough dynamic range in luminosity / sfr for such an exploration .",
    "however in the coming years , larger databases of global properties will become available ; galex laes will remain at around 100 objects ; hst spectroscopic samples already exceed this while imaging observations remain somewhat smaller .",
    "this should permit statistical studies studies using linear discriminant analyses , to determine how combinations of properties produce the observed  characteristics .",
    "many such possibilities may be envisaged if the signal is strong enough and the samples are sufficiently large .",
    "more empirically motivated simulations can be performed using the wealth of data available for low-@xmath9 galaxies as input .",
    "in such an approach , nature sets up the ism instead of computers .",
    "for example , transport calculations have been run in synthetic galaxies output by hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , although as yet there has been no attempt to construct realistic input conditions of a galaxy based upon observation .",
    "such an experiment is not easy , especially without detailed knowledge of the , but as that becomes available the more the study becomes a possibility . with maps of the ionizing stellar population , nebular gas and ionization structure ,  distribution including large and small scale kinematics , it will become possible to generate sets of model galaxies that are based upon real systems for which  observations have been obtained .",
    "transfer simulations in such models will then recover the  morphology and spectral profile , that can be tested against observation .",
