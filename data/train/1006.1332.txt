    "understanding the formation and dynamics of complex spatial structures or patterns has been of continuing interest due to the fundamental importance of predicting and controlling system properties and material functions .",
    "however , a comprehensive understanding is hindered by the fact that the processes involved are usually nonlinear , nonequilibrium , can span a variety of length and time scales , and are highly influenced by the complex coupling with materials growth and processing conditions .",
    "typical examples include the growth of strained solid films and the formation of nanostructures such as quantum dots or nanowires , which involve the interplay among microscopic crystalline structure , mesoscopic or nanoscale surface pattern , topological defects ( e.g. , dislocations ) , as well as various growth parameters such as temperature , misfit strain , growth rate , and film thickness @xcite .",
    "the system dynamics and evolution are further complicated in alloy samples , due to the additional coupling to spatial / temporal variation of alloy composition particularly in the case of phase separation @xcite",
    ".    to address these complex phenomena a variety of theoretical modeling and simulation methods have been developed , which can be roughly characterized via the level of description that they focus on . at the microscopic level capturing crystalline details , atomistic modeling techniques such as monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "have been widely adopted .",
    "for example , nanostructure ( e.g. , islands / pits ) formation during strained film epitaxy has been studied via the kinetic mc method incorporating elastic interaction and strain energy @xcite , while detailed structure and dynamics of crystal defects like grain boundaries and dislocations have been simulated by md @xcite .",
    "however , the limitation of small length and time scales addressed in these atomistic methods leads to large computational demands and hence the restriction of system size and evolution time range that can be accessed .",
    "such limitation can be overcome via continuum modeling methods , including continuum elasticity theory used in strained film growth @xcite and the well - known phase field models that have been applied to a wide range of areas such as crystal growth , nucleation , phase separation , solidification , defect dynamics , etc .",
    "these continuum approaches feature coarse - grained , long - wavelength scales and diffusive time dynamics , but are not formulated for the short - wavelength scales associated with microscopic crystalline details .",
    "to incorporate the advantages of these approaches and hence be able to simultaneously model crystalline details on length and time scales of experimental relevance , the phase field crystal ( pfc ) @xcite model and the related amplitude representation @xcite were developed recently .",
    "the pfc model incorporates the small length scales of the crystalline structure with diffusive time scales by describing the dynamics of the atomic number density field @xmath0 , a continuum field variable that is spatially periodic at atomic length scales in crystalline state @xcite . to alleviate the limitation imposed by the necessity of describing small length scales , an amplitude representation was developed to describe slowly varying envelope or amplitude functions while maintaining the basic features of crystalline states , particularly elasticity , plasticity and multiple crystal orientations .",
    "both the original pfc and corresponding amplitude representation have be extended to binary alloys @xcite . in the binary case",
    "the amplitude representation describes the amplitude and phase of the density field @xcite and also the concentration profile @xcite , which is assumed to vary on `` slow '' scales compared to atomic lattice spacing .",
    "a wide range of phenomena has been studied via this pfc method for both pure and binary material systems , including solidification @xcite , grain nucleation and growth @xcite , phase segregation @xcite , quantum dot growth during epitaxy @xcite , surface energy anisotropy @xcite , formation and melting of dislocations and grain boundaries @xcite , commensurate / incommensurate transitions @xcite , sliding friction @xcite , and glass formation @xcite . in addition , recent work has been conducted to extend the modeling to incorporate faster time scales associated with mechanical relaxation @xcite , and to develop new efficient computational methods @xcite .",
    "the pfc model can be connected to microscopic theory via classical density functional theory ( dft ) of freezing @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the pfc free energy functional can be derived from classical dft for either pure materials or binary mixtures @xcite , by approximating the two - point direct correlation function with a truncated fourier series and expanding the ideal - gas part of the dft free energy functional in a power series of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( up to 4th order ) @xcite .",
    "while this connection provides insight into the parameters that enter pfc models , the approximations used are quite drastic and the resulting model is a poor approximation of classical dft @xcite . a similar connection could be made with the atomic density formulation of jin and khachaturyan @xcite which is similar in form to the classical dft , although the parameters that enter are given a different physical interpretation .",
    "the main difficulty in directly simulating classical dft is that the solutions for @xmath0 are very sharply peaked around the lattice positions ( at least in metallic crystals ) , while simple pfc models predict very smooth sinusoidal profiles .",
    "this difference makes numerical simulations of a simple pfc model much simpler than classical dft as the former model s grid spacing can be a factor of ten larger than the latter s , so that in three dimensions a pfc model can simulate systems three orders of magnitudes larger than classical dft with the same memory requirements .",
    "in addition it has been shown that a simple pfc can be adjusted to match many material properties , such as surface energy and its anisotropy , bulk moduli , and the miscibility gap in three - dimensional ( 3d ) bcc iron @xcite and the velocity of liquid / solid fronts in two - dimensional ( 2d ) hexagonal crystal of colloids @xcite .",
    "another benefit of pfc modeling is the ability to efficiently simulate microstructure dynamics . at present",
    ", pfc dynamics has been largely introduced phenomenologically using time - dependent ginzburg - landau type dynamics @xcite .",
    "recent progress includes the derivation of hydrodynamic evolution equations for crystalline solids based on the poisson bracket formalism and the simplification to pfc equations @xcite .",
    "very recently research has been conducted to connect the pfc - type models with microscopic dynamics ( smoluchowski equation ) via dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite .",
    "these results were also based on the truncation of dft free energy up to two - point correlation function , and for single - component systems .    in this paper",
    "we provide a systematic derivation of pfc dynamics from ddft , for both single - component and binary systems that involve the evolution of atomic number density and alloy concentration fields ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ddft ] ) .",
    "our derivation includes contributions from three - point direct correlation functions , which have been shown important for the dft calculations @xcite .",
    "the original pfc models can be recovered via the lowest order approximation of our ddft results , with the pfc parameters being connected to quantities of dft correlation functions .",
    "our calculations can be directly extended to incorporate fourth and higher order correlation functions in dft .    to complete the pfc methodology for binary systems ,",
    "the full amplitude equation formalism is established for a 2d system with hexagonal / triangular crystalline symmetry .",
    "it incorporates the effects of species - dependent atomic mobility and average ( zeroth - mode ) atomic density that are usually coupled with the dynamics of structural amplitudes and concentration field during system evolution but absent in previous studies of binary pfc . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : ampl ] , the standard multiple - scale expansion is first applied to derive the lowest order amplitude equations , followed by a hybrid approach that we develop here to obtain the equations incorporating all orders of expansion .",
    "furthermore , stochastic amplitude equations are derived for both single - component and binary pfc models , showing the corresponding noise dynamics as well as its coupling due to different atomic mobilities of system components ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] ) .",
    "as has been discussed in previous research , the advantage of the amplitude equation representation can be revealed via its large increase of computational efficiency due to the large length and time scales involved @xcite and also its amenability to advanced numerical schemes such as adaptive mesh refinement method @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these amplitude equations are more amenable to analytic calculations as shown in recent studies of surface nanostructure formation in strained epitaxial films @xcite as well as in most recent results for establishing the correspondence between pfc type models and traditional phase field approaches @xcite . to further illustrate these advantages , in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl ] we present a sample application of the derived binary pfc amplitude equations to the phenomenon of surface segregation and alloy intermixing .",
    "this is of particular importance in material growth ( e.g. , group vi or iii - v semiconductor thin film epitaxy @xcite ) , but rather limited information and understanding is available to date .",
    "we focus on both liquid - solid(crystal ) coexistence profile and the coherent growth of strained solid layers , and show the control of intra- and inter - layer diffusion by varying material parameters including solute expansion coefficient ( due to different atomic sizes ) , misfit strain in alloy layers , and the mobility difference between alloy components .",
    "this study provides an understanding of mass transport mechanisms during material growth and evolution .",
    "the dynamic processes of strained layer growth as well as the associated composition overshooting phenomenon are obtained in our calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl ] .",
    "the results are compared to experimental findings of vertical composition segregation or surface enrichment as widely encountered during the growth of various alloy heterostructure systems such as inas / gaas , ge / si , gaas / gasb , inp / ingaas , etc . @xcite .",
    "we start from the ddft equation governing the evolution of a time - dependent local atomic number density field @xmath2 , @xmath3 , \\label{eq : ddft}\\ ] ] which was first proposed phenomenologically @xcite and was later derived by various groups via microscopic brownian dynamics @xcite and hamiltonian dynamics and hydrodynamics @xcite ( see ref .",

    "details of the correlation functions depend on the specific material systems studied and are usually calculated via various approximations @xcite . following the original pfc approach @xcite , the fourier component of the two - point correlation function @xmath15",

    "this can be justified from the previous results of hard - spheres dft calculations that nonzero wavenumber components of @xmath24 have been shown to yield minor contributions @xcite and that as order @xmath14 increases , the oscillation details of @xmath25 become less and less relevant compared to the zero wavenumber mode @xcite .    defining the rescaled atomic density field @xmath26 and using the approximations ( [ eq : c2 ] ) and ( [ eq : c3 ] ) , the free energy functional ( [ eq : f_rho_c3 ] ) becomes @xmath27 , \\label{eq : f_c3}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 - { \\cal f}[\\rho_l]$ ] , and @xmath29 substituting eq .",

    "however , this would then be a 2nd - order dynamic equation due to the absence of @xmath37 term , and as found in our numerical tests , is more difficult to converge at long enough time compared to the full 3rd - order eq .",
