    "the most important success of the inflationary universe scenario @xcite is that it provides a causal mechanism for the origin of the observed density fluctuations and microwave background anisotropies  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "key to this success is the fact that the physical wavelength corresponding to a fixed comoving scale is exponentially stretched during the period of inflation .",
    "thus , provided that the period of inflation lasts sufficiently long , fluctuations on scales of cosmological interest today originate on sub - hubble scales during inflation .",
    "since inflation red - shifts all initial classical fluctuations , it is reasonable to assume that matter starts out in a quantum vacuum state ( in the frame set by the background cosmology , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "each fluctuation mode thus starts out in its vacuum state at the time that the initial conditions are set up ( e.g. the beginning of the period of inflation ) , it undergoes quantum vacuum oscillations while the wavelength is smaller than the hubble radius , but freezes out when the wavelength equals the hubble radius ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews of the theory of cosmological fluctuations ) .",
    "subsequently , the quantum state of the fluctuations undergoes squeezing on super - hubble scales , and re - enters the hubble radius during the post - inflationary friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) phase as a highly squeezed and effectively classical state ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the classicalization of the state ) .    however , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this success of inflationary cosmology leads to an important conceptual problem , the _ trans - planckian problem_. since the period of inflation in typical scalar - field - driven inflationary models is very long ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , the scales of cosmological interest today are not only sub - hubble , but in fact sub - planck at the beginning of inflation .",
    "thus , the formalism used to calculate the evolution of fluctuations is in fact not justified .",
    "it is possible that the unknown trans - planckian physics will lead to an evolution of the fluctuations on sub - planckian scales which from the point of view of free scalar field theory coupled to general relativity looks non - adiabatic . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , toy models for such an evolution were constructed making use of modified dispersion relations which were assumed to describe the physics on sub - planckian scales . since the time interval spent in the trans - planckian domain may depend on the wavelength",
    ", such models may lead to changes in the spectral index of the fluctuations .",
    "subsequently , other approaches to the trans - planckian problem were suggested , e.g. analysis based on space - space non - commutativity  @xcite , space - time non - commutativity  @xcite , minimal trans - planckian assumptions ( starting each mode in some vacuum state at the time when its wavelength equals the planck length )  @xcite .",
    "these analysis typically give that trans - planckian corrections to the predictions for cosmological fluctuations are proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter during inflation , @xmath2 a new scale at which non standard physical effects show up and @xmath3 a number which depends on the initial state assumed at the time of `` creation '' . on the other hand ,",
    "analysis based on modified dispersion relations give a correction proportional to the time spent by the physical modes in the region where adiabaticity is violated , see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "tanaka  @xcite and starobinsky  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) have , however , raised an important concern regarding the possible amplitude of trans - planckian corrections ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for unrelated concerns ) : if trans - planckian physics leads to an excited state for fluctuation modes on sub - hubble but super - planck scale during the period of inflation , the back - reaction of these excitations on the background must be considered . in the case",
    "where the trans - planckian effects are modeled by a modified dispersion relation , a simple estimate of the energy density carried in these ultraviolet modes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the physical wavenumber , @xmath6 is the occupation number , and @xmath7 is the frequency of the mode , leads to the conclusion that @xmath8 will exceed the background density unless @xmath6 is smaller than @xmath9 [ see also eq .",
    "( [ consbeta ] ) above ] , thus constraining the possible effects of trans - planckian physics on the spectrum of fluctuations ( in the above , we have assumed that the ultraviolet cutoff is the usual planck scale @xmath10 which is not mandatory at all ) .    in this article , we point out some subtleties with the above back - reaction argument which may change the conclusions dramatically . if we assume , as is conventionally done in analyzing quantum fields in curved space - time , that the ultraviolet cutoff scale is time - independent in terms of physical length , then in an exponentially expanding background geometry , the contribution of ultraviolet ( i.e. sub - hubble ) modes to the energy density is constant in time , as , in fact , follows directly from the time translation invariance of the physics .",
    "moreover , the corresponding equation of state , due to the fact that the dispersion relation is modified , can strongly differ from that of ultra - relativistic particles and , as we demonstrate below , tends to that of the vacuum .",
    "hence , our main conclusion is that , instead of preventing inflation , the ultraviolet modes may in fact simply renormalize the value of the cosmological constant driving inflation .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section , sec .",
    "ii , we describe the arguments that have been put forward to claim that there is a back - reaction problem and we criticize them .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we present an explicit calculation of the equation of state of a scalar field with a modified dispersion relation . we show that the ultraviolet modes possess an equation of state which is almost that of a cosmological constant . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we point out problems with our approach , indicate directions for further investigations and present our general conclusions .",
    "as explained in the introduction , it is possible that the trans - planckian effects affect the standard inflationary predictions . in this paper , for the sake of illustration , we model physics at very short scales by a non - linear dispersion relation @xmath11 . for wave - numbers such that @xmath12 where @xmath2 is a new scale at which non - standard physical effects show up , the dispersion relation is linear for obvious phenomenological reasons . on the contrary , for modes such that @xmath13 , the shape of @xmath14 is a priori unknown .",
    "it is has been shown that a non - adiabatic evolution of the mode function in the trans - planckian region necessarily implies a modification of the inflationary predictions , in particular a modification of the power spectrum . to be more precise , in cosmology",
    ", the dispersion relation becomes time - dependent and equal to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote comoving frequency and wavenumber , respectively ) .",
    "then , the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation is satisfied provided that @xmath18 , where the quantity @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 ( a prime stands for the derivative with respect to conformal time ) , see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "if the previous condition is worked out , then one sees that the wkb approximation is violated if @xmath21 and that corrections to the standard result can occur in this case .",
    "this conclusion has been criticized in refs .",
    "@xcite and many reasons why a modification of the inflationary power spectrum would be unlikely have been provided in these articles . in the following",
    ", we will examine each of them .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been claimed that if @xmath11 is such that the wkb approximation is violated for @xmath22 then there are no preferred initial conditions .",
    "this is certainly correct for the class of dispersion relations considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but not true in general .",
    "an explicit counter - example has been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite and is studied in the present paper .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ disp ] . on this plot ,",
    "one notices that in the region where @xmath23 there is an interval of finite range , namely @xmath24 $ ] , in which the wkb approximation is violated ( _ i.e .  _",
    "@xmath25 ) . important for our analysis is also the fact that for @xmath26 the adiabatic approximation is restored , which follows since we have @xmath27 . in this latter regime ,",
    "the adiabatic vacuum is obviously the preferred initial state .",
    "the other arguments involve the calculation of the stress - energy tensor and are as follows . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the initial conditions are fixed for all wavenumbers at some initial time .",
    "if the number of e - foldings of inflation is greater than about 70 , the physical wavelength of modes which are currently probed in cosmic microwave experiments is smaller than the planck length at the beginning of inflation .",
    "one usually assumes that the evolution starts out from the adiabatic ( bunch - davis ) vacuum .",
    "if the evolution is non - adiabatic in the region @xmath22 , then the state in the region @xmath28 will differ from the usual adiabatic vacuum . therefore ,",
    "if one concentrates only on what happens in the region @xmath28 , the trans - planckian effects boil down to a modification of the initial conditions .",
    "this last argument has been used in refs .  @xcite as follows . roughly speaking",
    ", a non - vacuum state means a non - vanishing energy density and there is now the danger that this dominates over the energy density of the inflationary background which is @xmath29 .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , this is actually what happens unless the level of excitation of the initial state compared to the adiabatic vacuum is very small , leading to unmeasurably small trans - planckian effects of the spectrum of fluctuations . since observational evidence seems to indicate that inflation is the correct theory of the very early universe , refs .",
    "@xcite conclude that trans - planckian effects of significant importance are in fact not possible .    in order to understand the above argument in more details ,",
    "let us be more accurate about what has actually been done in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that cosmological perturbations ( density fluctuations and gravitational waves ) can , in some contexts , be viewed as a free scalar field @xmath30 on a time - dependent background space - time . in the case of gravitational waves ,",
    "the correspondence is exact , for scalar metric fluctuations ( density perturbations ) , the correspondence is only exact if the equation of state of the background is time - independent . in the general case , the squeezing factor for the density fluctuations",
    "is given not by the flrw scale factor @xmath31 , but by a function @xmath32 which depends both on the background geometry and the background matter - for details see e.g. @xcite .",
    "then , the corresponding energy density and pressure are given by the mean values of the stress - energy tensor @xmath33 .",
    "in an excited state characterized by the mode distribution function @xmath34 , one has    @xmath35\\times   \\left[a^2\\left|\\left(\\frac{\\mu_k}{a}\\right)'\\right|^2       + k^2\\left|\\mu_k\\right|^2\\right]\\ , , \\\\",

    ", @xmath39 denotes conformal time , and a prime the derivative with respect to @xmath39 .    in the above expressions , the terms proportional to the factor @xmath40 are divergent in the ultra - violet regime , i.e. @xmath41 , and represent the quantum vacuum contribution .",
    "this means that , in order to give sense to the above expressions , the stress energy tensor should be first properly renormalized , for instance by adiabatic regularization  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will simply subtract the contribution of the quantum vacuum energy since this is what has been done in refs .",
    "another justification is that we are in fact mainly interested in the terms proportional to @xmath42 which describe the contributions originating from the excited quanta .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , considerations have been restricted to physical modes such that @xmath28 . in this region ,",
    "the dispersion relation is linear and , since the wkb approximation is satisfied , the mode function can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 . inserting this mode function into the vacuum expressions of the energy density and pressure",
    ", one finds @xmath45 we see that the coefficient @xmath46 represents the number of particles , @xmath47 .",
    "this describes the modification of the standard initial conditions due to the trans - planckian effects ( let us remind that the usual adiabatic initial conditions correspond to @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "then , a back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that @xmath50 where we have used the fact that , in de sitter space - time , the coefficient @xmath51 is scale - independent ( time translation invariance ) .",
    "if we require that the energy density of the test scalar field be smaller than the background density , then it follows that @xmath52 a similar expression has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath53 and , crucially , @xmath1 replaced with @xmath54 , the present value of the hubble parameter .",
    "it is clear that the constraint on @xmath51 is completely different ( and much more difficult to satisfy ) if one uses @xmath55 in the above equation rather than @xmath56 ( we also notice that @xmath2 needs not be the planck mass ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is again ( see above the discussion of the preferred initial conditions ) that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was assumed that violation of the wkb approximation in the trans - planckian region necessarily implies that @xmath57 as @xmath58 , as for the dispersion relation envisaged in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in this case , the adiabatic condition is violated today for a range of trans - planckian modes , and one should indeed replace @xmath1 by @xmath54 as done in ref .",
    "this results in a very strong constraint on @xmath59 .",
    "this was in fact the essence of the criticism made in ref .",
    "@xcite against the dispersion relation considered in ref .",
    "however , again , the argument does not apply for dispersion relations of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ disp ] and , therefore , is not true in general .",
    "the reason can be very easily understood from fig .  [ disp ] . since , after inflation , the hubble parameter decreases and",
    "since , at some point , its value becomes smaller than the minimum of the dispersion relation , the adiabatic condition is restored at late times for all modes , and particle production stops .",
    "therefore , in this case , the calculation should be done with @xmath1 and not with @xmath54 as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that there is a window for which the modification of the power spectrum is not completely negligible and for which there is no back - reaction problem , see for instance the discussion after eq .",
    "( 68 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other arguments presented against possible trans - planckian modifications of the inflationary power spectrum involve the calculation of the equation of state ( which is characterized by the parameter @xmath60 ) .",
    "the main argument is that the `` dangerous '' created particles behave as a radiation field ( or as ultra - relativistic particles ) and , therefore , that their energy density scales as @xmath61 and not as the vacuum , see ref .",
    "we now explain why this line of reasoning is problematic .",
    "first of all , using the stress - energy tensor of a test scalar field is questionable since one wants in fact to calculate the equation of state of the cosmological perturbations , not that of a test scalar field .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the equation of state of the effective stress - energy tensor of the cosmological perturbations differs on super - hubble scales ( which is a region in which the adiabatic condition is not valid and thus has similarities to the trans - planckian interval where the adiabatic condition is violated ) from the equation of state of a test field .",
    "it is @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 .",
    "the difference is clearly of utmost importance in the present context .",
    "in fact , what should be done is to calculate the stress - energy tensor of cosmological perturbations ( which is second order in the perturbed metric ) in the case where the dispersion relation is modified . to our knowledge",
    ", this calculation has never been performed , and is very complicated .",
    "therefore , this is beyond the scope of the present article .    keeping the previous point in mind ,",
    "let us come back to the calculation of the stress - energy tensor of a test scalar field .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction [ and demonstrated explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ enerphys ] ) ] , @xmath8 is in fact constant and does not scale as @xmath61 despite the fact that @xmath64 .",

    "( [ rhouv ] ) .",
    "the first one comes from the upper limit while the second one originates from the lower limit .",
    "the corresponding physical interpretation is clear : due to the expansion of the background , there is a flow of modes coming from the trans - planckian region and entering the region @xmath28 and there is also a flow of modes leaving the region @xmath28 while they are becoming super - hubble modes .",
    "( [ nonconserv ] ) is similar to eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is the absence in ref .",
    "@xcite of the second term on the right - hand - side ( describing the outgoing flow of modes ) .",
    "this term is necessarily present because the integral in eq .",
    "( [ rhouv ] ) can not be computed with a vanishing lower integral since , for @xmath66 , the mode function is no longer given by eq .",
    "( [ wkbstandard ] ) but rather by @xmath67 .",
    "however , the second term in ( [ nonconserv ] ) is clearly very small in comparison with the first one and , therefore , can be safely neglected .",
    "finally , maybe the most important reason why calculating the back - reaction can be more subtle than previously thought is the following .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath68 is in fact obtained from an inconsistent procedure since it does not take into account the fact that the dispersion relation is modified [ let us remind that the previous considerations are based on eqs .",

    ", we shall study the equation of state of the ultraviolet terms ( [ rhouv ] ) and ( [ uv2 ] ) in a toy model for trans - planckian physics in which we can describe the excitation of the mode functions in the far ultraviolet range from well - defined vacuum initial conditions in a mathematically consistent way .",
    "we shall show that the fact that the dispersion relation is modified can change the equation of state , a conclusion also reached in ref .",
    "@xcite in a slightly different context .    to summarize",
    ", the calculation of the back - reaction must be performed with the trans - planckian corrections taken into account ( _ i.e .",
    "_ in the present context with a modified dispersion relation ) .",
    "it is clearly inconsistent to calculate the modified power spectrum with the trans - planckian corrections on one hand and , on the other hand , to evaluate the corresponding back - reaction without these corrections .",
    "this can change , in a crucial way , the calculation of the energy density and/or the equation of state .",
    "we model the trans - planckian effect by means of the following non - standard dispersion relation @xcite @xmath70 this dispersion relation is chosen such that the modes evolve adiabatically for extremely high wavenumbers , but , given an appropriate choice of the constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 , there is an intermediate region of wavenumbers in which the mode evolution is not adiabatic .",
    "we will start the modes in their adiabatic vacuum in the extreme ultraviolet and calculate how they are excited during the phase in which the evolution violates the adiabaticity condition .    if we introduce the new dimensionless coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a new free energy scale to be specified later on , then the dispersion relation can be re - written as @xmath78 it is represented in fig .

    "nevertheless , we have shown with the help of the previous toy model that any attempt to evaluate the equation of state of the cosmological perturbations in a regime where the dispersion relation is modified must take into account these trans - planckian corrections .",

    "given this setup , we consider the energy density @xmath195 of ultraviolet modes ( modes with wavelength smaller than the hubble radius ) which is the sum of  ( [ nuven ] ) and  ( [ fuven ] ) , see eq .",
    "( [ totalrho ] ) . by time - translation invariance of the background , both terms are independent of time in a de sitter background in which @xmath1 is constant .",
    "thus , @xmath196 this seems to indicate that the ultraviolet energy density evolves like a cosmological constant , and its back - reaction , rather than preventing inflation , will simply lead to a renormalization of the cosmological constant .",
    "naive intuition , namely treating the equation of state as radiative , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath197 , would have led to a problem with this conclusion , namely an extreme non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the ultraviolet modes , a non - conservation on the energy density scale of @xmath198 ( in this context the difference between @xmath199 and @xmath189 is not relevant ) .",
    "however , our analysis of the previous section has shown that in fact the energy - momentum tensor of the ultraviolet modes is that of a cosmological constant , up to correction terms which are suppressed by a factor of @xmath200 compared to the dominant terms .",

    "the back - reaction of the linear fluctuations on the background is described by contributions @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( and we use the ultraviolet energy densities and pressures as the back - reaction quantities ) to the energy density and pressure .",

    "( [ br2 ] ) , the back - reaction terms can lead to a faster rolling of the scalar field @xmath222 .",

    "we have shown that the back - reaction of an excited state preserving time - translation invariance does not prevent inflation , but simply leads to a renormalization of the hubble constant .",
    "however , back - reaction will lead to a slightly faster rolling of the scalar field .",
    "as long as the occupation numbers @xmath193 are smaller than @xmath227 , the rolling will be consistent with the standard inflationary paradigm .",
    "such occupation numbers can lead to observable effects on the cosmic microwave background .    to render the analysis well defined , we have considered a dispersion relation for which the violation of adiabaticity is concentrated in a finite range of physical wavenumbers @xmath228 .",

    "they are squeezed while @xmath230 , and then emerge as excited states when @xmath231 .",
    "let us also notice that by making the wavelength interval @xmath228 small , the energy density in the far ultraviolet modes can always be made small compared to the cutoff energy density @xmath232 ( or @xmath233 ) .",

    "the hilbert space of modes is time - independent , but as time proceeds an increasing subset of this space gets populated .",
    "our mechanism for continual excitation of new modes appears to be more smooth than the lattice approach of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are several important deficiencies in our analysis .",
    "first , we have used an ad - hoc regularization and renormalization prescription which consists of imposing effectively an abrupt cutoff in momentum space , and of subtracting the ground state energy of each field fourier mode .",
    "this procedure is not covariant .",
    "it would be of interest to study our problem using a mathematically more rigorous regularization prescription , such as adiabatic regularization ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another serious concern is that we have considered matter fluctuations without taking into account the induced metric fluctuations .",
    "it is well known that the inclusion of metric fluctuations leads to dramatically different results for super - hubble - scale perturbations  @xcite .",
    "thus , one might expect that the gravitational fluctuations could play an important role in the far ultraviolet region where @xmath234 .",
