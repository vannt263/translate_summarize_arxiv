    "to understand the connection between the observed properties of mesons and baryons and the underlying qcd quark - gluon dynamics is one of the greatest challenges in hadron physics . at present , models are needed to establish a link between the results from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations @xcite and the existing experimental data , as well as the ones from future experimental programs , for instance at jlab and fair .",
    "any realistic model of hadrons must incorporate two key features that dominate the real world : ( i ) dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking ",
    "responsible for the spontaneous generation of a constituent quark mass , which , in the chiral limit , is linked to the existence of the zero - mass pion through the famous njl mechanism , and ( ii ) quark confinement .",
    "our model differs in two important aspects from the very successful dyson - schwinger approaches ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) : ( i ) we work in a framework formulated in _ physical",
    "_ minkowski space instead of _ unphysical _ euclidean space , which allows , for instance , the straightforward calculation of transition form factors in the timelike region , and ( ii ) we are able to accomodate a lorentz - scalar confining interaction as suggested by phenomenological approaches and lattice calculations  @xcite ( although those indications are not definitive ) . such a scalar confining interaction can be included without spoiling chiral symmetry , as it decouples in the chiral limit , allowing the njl mechanism to work .    a more detailed description of our work , which can be viewed as an extention , improvement and application of earlier work by gross , milana and avkli @xcite based on the covariant spectator theory ( cst )  @xcite , can be found in refs .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we propose a manifestly covariant model for the @xmath0 interaction that incorporates both spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "our model is particularly suited for the treatment of the light mesons such as the pion . in this case",
    "a four - channel cst formulation is employed which is invariant under charge conjugation . on the other hand , in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the cst equation reduces to the schrdinger equation .",
    "this makes our approach suitable for a unified description of all @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we use a kernel consisting of the sum of a momentum - space @xmath1-function with a pure vector lorentz structure and a mixed scalar - vector confining interaction .",
    "our kernel includes ( strong ) phenomenological form factors @xmath2  @xcite for each quark line associated with momentum @xmath3 .",
    "they can be regarded an effective description of the infinite sum of overlapping gluon loop corrections to the interaction vertices and they also provide convergence in loop integrals .",
    "spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking is included via a njl - type mechanism : a self - consistency condition ensures that the cst equation for a pseudoscalar bound state has a zero - mass solution ( goldstone pion ) in the chiral limit of a vanishing current quark mass @xmath4 . a finite dressed quark mass",
    "is then generated dynamically through the self - interactions of the quark with the @xmath0 interaction kernel . in previous models  @xcite",
    "the quark mass function has been approximated by a phenomenological function . in the present approach",
    "we actually calculate the mass function directly from the @xmath0 interaction kernel , which makes our model completely self - consistent . for",
    "a particular lorentz scalar - vector mixing the confining potential does not contribute to the dynamical quark mass generation . in this case",
    "our mass function involves only 3 free parameters , the constituent quark mass @xmath5 in the chiral limit , a mass parameter @xmath6 from the quark form factors and the strength @xmath7 of the @xmath1-function kernel .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fixed in the chiral limit by a fit to the lattice data  @xcite extrapolated to @xmath8 , which gives @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the mass function for different values of @xmath4",
    "is then found by solving the corresponding gap equation , with @xmath7 as a function of @xmath4 chosen appropriately to fit the data .",
    "the mass function result reads  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the ( strong ) quark form factors with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the lattice data ( calculated in euclidean space ) are compared with our minkowski - space results at negative @xmath15 , as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .    .",
    "the five curves and ( extrapolated ) data sets from bottom to top correspond to bare quark masses @xmath8 ( black , blobs ) , @xmath16 gev ( blue , squares ) , @xmath17 gev ( green , diamonds ) , and @xmath18 gev ( red , triangles ) and @xmath19 gev ( brown , inverted triangles).,height=226 ]    when fixing our mass function parameters we have fitted only the first 50 data points ( in the low-@xmath15 region between 0 and @xmath20 ) of the chiral - limit extrapolation of the lattice data .",
    "the reason for this are finite lattice spacing effects , responsible for the deviation of the lattice data from the correct asymptotic uv - behavior , that are expected to be small in this low-@xmath15 region .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows , that for small @xmath4 and for small @xmath15 our mass function provides a good fit to the lattice data .",
    "as a first application of the formalism developed in  @xcite we use the mass function  ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the chiral limit for the computation of the pion electromagnetic form factor in relativistic impulse approximation ( ria )  @xcite . for simplicity , we adopt an approximated pion vertex function that is an off - shell extension of the solution in the chiral limit , together with a dressed quark current that satisfies the ward - takahashi identity  @xcite . remarkably , the pion form factor @xmath21 result is insensitive to the particular choice of the quark form factors @xmath2 , but it depends on the pion mass @xmath22 , in particular at small @xmath23 . for sufficiently large @xmath24 one expects the ria , i.e. , keeping only the spectator quark pole contribution of the triangle diagram , to be a good approximation for the full triangle diagram of the pion form factor , not only at high but also at low @xmath23  @xcite . in particular , the value @xmath22=0.42 gev gives the best fit to the experimental data  @xcite over the full range of @xmath23 . at large @xmath23",
    "we find an interesting scaling behavior between form factors of different pion masses : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a scaling parameter . in figure  [ fig:2 ] the large-@xmath23 tail of the form factor for @xmath27 gev",
    "is scaled to fit the one for @xmath28 gev .     when scaled with @xmath29",
    "( red dashed line ) to fit the form factor @xmath30 ( black solid line ) together with the @xmath31-pole contribution ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "the right panel shows the same form factors but scaled with @xmath23 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]   when scaled with @xmath29 ( red dashed line ) to fit the form factor @xmath30 ( black solid line ) together with the @xmath31-pole contribution ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "the right panel shows the same form factors but scaled with @xmath23 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    it should be emphasized that this is a very simple model for the pion form factor that does not include explicit contributions from the @xmath31 meson which should be important according to vector meson dominance .",
    "nevertheless , our result exhibits the correct monopole behavior at large @xmath23 and is in good agreement with the data .",
    "a possible explanation would be that part of these contributions are already effectively contained in the strong quark form factors , but this interesting hypothesis needs to be further investigated .    to summarize , the purpose of this work is to show that our model is able to give sensible results for both , the quark and the pion structure at the same time .",
    "it is clear that for a more quantitative study of the light meson properties the solution of the complete four - channel cst equation is needed , together with a more refined dressed quark current including the @xmath31 pole contribution",
