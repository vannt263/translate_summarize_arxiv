    "a cat(0 ) space @xmath0 has two natural boundaries with the same underlying point set , the visual boundary , @xmath1 and the tits boundary , @xmath2 .",
    "the obvious bijection from @xmath2 to @xmath1 is continuous , but need not be a homeomorphism .    in the classical case where @xmath0 is a riemannian @xmath3-manifold of non - positive sectional curvature ,",
    "then @xmath4 , so the visual boundary contains very little information ( only the dimension ) .",
    "the tits boundary , on the other hand , is much more interesting .",
    "for example the tits boundary of @xmath5 is also @xmath6 , while the tits boundary of @xmath7 is discrete .",
    "these are of course different for @xmath8 . even in the case",
    "where @xmath9 , there are at least two other possible tits boundaries : the tits boundary of @xmath10 is the spherical suspension of an uncountable discrete set ; and the examples of croke and kleiner give the infamous eye of sauran pattern . in this paper",
    "we examine the other extreme , where the visual topology dictates the tits metric .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 admits a geometric group action .",
    "ruane showed in @xcite that if @xmath1 is a suspension of cantor set , then @xmath2 is the spherical suspension of an uncountable discrete set . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that if @xmath1 is the join of two cantor sets , and if @xmath0 admits a geometric action by a group @xmath11 that contains @xmath12 , then @xmath2 is isometric to the spherical join of two uncountable discrete sets .    in this paper , we prove that the same result holds without the @xmath12 assumption on @xmath11 .",
    "we use the action of ultrafilters over @xmath11 on @xmath1 , whose properties were investigated in the paper @xcite",
    ". we will also show that if @xmath1 is the suspension of a join of two cantor sets , then @xmath2 is also the spherical suspension of the spherical join of two uncountable discrete sets .",
    "these results suggest the definition of tits rigidity , and the above results can be rephrased into saying that the suspension of a cantor set , the join of two cantor sets and the suspension of the join of two cantor sets are tits rigid . on the other hand , a sphere of dimension @xmath13 is not tits rigid since , as we saw , @xmath5 and @xmath7 have different tits boundaries .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : this section reviews some basic notions and defines tits rigidity ; section 2 completes the proof that the join of two cantor set is tits rigid ; and section 3 proves that the suspension of the join of two cantor set is tits rigid .",
    "we states some questions in section 4 .",
