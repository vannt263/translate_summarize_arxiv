    "neutrino interactions with nucleons and nuclei have received a considerable attention in recent years stimulated by the needs in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments which give information about the oscillation probability @xmath8 .",
    "actually , new high quality data on cross sections are becoming available from miniboone and sciboone experiments @xcite . the neutrino energy that enters critically in the oscillation probability",
    "is not directly measurable but has to be reconstructed from the reaction products . in appearance",
    "experiments the initial and final neutrinos fluxes are compared to get the oscillation probability .",
    "in fact , miniboone was designed to measure the @xmath9 appearance signal in the energy range around @xmath3 gev , detecting electrons from the @xmath10 reaction via cerenkov radiation . in this case ,",
    "neutral current @xmath11 events ( nc@xmath12 ) are an important source of background because the electron is not distinguished from a photon coming from @xmath13 decay if the other photon is missed .",
    "this would lead to fake @xmath1 signal in contrast with the true coming form the ccqe .",
    "however , another important source of single - photon background exists : the @xmath6 ( nc@xmath14 ) reaction , which can also be interpreted as a @xmath1 arriving signal .",
    "recent miniboone experiment reported , after various refinements , a persisting excess of electron - like events at low energy @xcite . in the recent nc@xmath14 cross section calculation and analysis from hill @xcite , it has been shown that process seems capable to provide enough photons to cover the excess found by miniboone .",
    "however , the implemented model is not completely _ consistent _ since the vertex and propagator used for the @xmath7 correspond to a different value of the parameter associated to contact transformations on the spin 3/2 field ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then , it is important to treat consistently and on the same footing both , the @xmath15 and photon production cross sections , to provide a trustily constraint of these of backgrounds . in the @xmath16 gev region relevant for miniboone and sciboone experiments , the process following in importance to the qe scattering is the excitation of the @xmath17 mev ) resonance .",
    "nuclei are used as neutrino detectors and require the inclusion of nuclear medium effects on the free nucleon cross sections .",
    "a consistent treatment should remedy the before mentioned resonance vertex - propagator correspondence and also keep the preservation of the electromagnetic gauge invariance in presence of finite widths .",
    "this program has been already developed with success for another reactions involving the @xmath7 resonance , which encourage us to develop here a model for the evaluation of the cross section of the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "we perform here the calculation of nc@xmath14 cross section by considering only the contribution of the resonant amplitude shown in fig .",
    "the total cross section is given by        ( e_^cm)= _ 0^e_^+ de_^cm _ e_^-^e_^+ de_^cm _ -1^+1dcos_0 ^ 2d _ spin , pol| m|^2 , [ crossw]where @xmath18 , with the limits in the integrals estimated from kinematical conditions , and where @xmath19 .",
    "the resonant amplitude reads    @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the neutrino , initial and final nucleon momenta , respectively , and @xmath24 is the @xmath25 boson momentum .",
    "@xmath26 reads ( @xmath27 is photon momentum and @xmath28 ) _",
    "r^(p , p,q)= ^(p,p_,q_=p_-p)_^ *  ig_(p_=p - q)w^(p_,q = p - p_,p ) , [ deltapole]some calculations involving the @xmath7 production take the simplest form for @xmath29 ( contact constant @xmath30 ) @xcite and , simultaneously , the simplest one for the vertex ( @xmath31 . to avoid this problem and get @xmath32 -independent amplitudes we use a set of reduced @xmath32-independent feynman rules @xcite .",
    "the expression for the corresponding bare @xmath7 propagator and weak vertex @xmath33 was defined in ref .",
    "finally , the @xmath34 decay vertex , from which @xmath35 is extracted through the cvc hypothesis , was defined in ref .",
    "the amplitude , should be multiplied by the new isospin factor @xmath36 for both processes with single photon production induced by neutral currents : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we show in figure [ fig2 ] the cross section for nc@xmath12 and nc@xmath14 backgrounds to the ccqe process , for @xmath39 gev .",
    "the contribution of the radiative @xmath40 process is roughly one hundred times smaller than the neutral current one , since @xmath41 . in the same figure",
    "we compare our results with those from fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained within an inconsistent model .",
    "we can observe that differences are not important at low energies but yes in the upper region where the @xmath7 resonance becomes relevant .",
    "this is also an expectable result originated by the fact we are considering the correct complete @xmath7 propagator ( @xmath42 ) in eq . .      in summary ,",
    "the results obtained within our present _ consistent _ formalism for @xmath40 process were compared with a previous determination that lacks in consistence in the treatment of the resonance field @xcite .",
    "our treatment gives similar results in the low energy region and increases the single photon cross section in the @xmath7 region . in view of these results",
    ", it would be interesting to reanalyze the excess of events counting contribution of this reaction done in ref .",
    "this finally answer the question if radiative corrections provides enough photons to cover the low energy excess found by miniboone ."
