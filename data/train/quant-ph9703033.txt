    "both before and since the recent demonstrations of bose - einstein condensation  @xcite in dilute alkali gases , the concept of the phase of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has attracted a deal of theoretical study . traditionally , the existence of a phase is taken as a signature of spontaneous symmetry breaking and strictly it is only the relative phase of two bec s that can be assigned a definite value .",
    "many people have discussed the difficulties associated with the fact that in many cases , we may know the number of atoms present fairly precisely .",
    "the condensate is thus in a state that can not possess a well - defined phase .",
    "recently , several authors  @xcite have modelled systems containing two bec s , demonstrating that a relative phase can arise naturally , even when both condensates are initially in number states .",
    "typically , atoms are permitted to leak out from both traps and are detected by some apparatus below . as it is unknown",
    "from which trap any individual atom comes , the distribution of positions at which atoms are detected shows interference fringes . at the same time , the quantum state of the two traps evolves from a simple product of number states into an entangled state of varying number _ differences _ between the traps allowing a well - defined relative phase to appear between the two condensates .",
    "the value of the relative phase is randomly distributed from run to run so that for an ensemble of runs , the phase symmetry is restored .    the influence of inter - atomic collisions on such a system has also been considered  @xcite .",
    "the notable results are a reduction in the visibility of the observed interference pattern , and in the conditional visibility of the entangled state , due to diffusion of the condensate phase . moreover , stopping the detection process after a relative phase has been established leads to collapses and revivals in the conditional visibility  @xcite , as the collisions cause the phases of different components of the entangled state to rotate at different rates .",
    "as the total state is a discrete sum of number difference states , the phases realign periodically and the visibility is restored .",
    "an obvious consequence of detecting atoms is that the system can not attain a steady state . in time , the trap occupancies fall so low that the entangled state is reduced in size until eventually the atoms in one or both traps are exhausted altogether . if one envisaged using the two - trap system as a real `` device '' rather than merely an analogy for a single condensate , this might be a serious problem .",
    "a natural use would be as a kind of two - beam `` atom laser '' in which additional atoms would be tapped off from each trap through an output coupler into separate beams  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) , as in the case of two remarkable recent experiments at mit  @xcite .",
    "the relative phase between the bec s in the traps built up by the measurement process would then be reflected in the same well - defined relative phase between the two output beams , that could be exploited for some other interference experiment .",
    "while such a scheme could operate in a pulsed fashion where the traps were repeatedly filled with atoms , measured until exhausted and then the process repeated ( as was the case for the experiments just mentioned ) , it would also be useful to have a continuous output .",
    "this would clearly require a continuous pumping of new atoms into the traps .",
    "we note of course , that interference measurements on the output beams would themselves act to produce a relative phase between the traps .",
    "it may be however , that the desired rate of measurements on the output beams is too low to stabilize the phase over long periods , whereas the detection rate directly on the traps may be as large as necessary . here",
    "we assume that the rate at which subsequent measurements are made on the output beams is so low that they have a negligibly small feedback on the entangled state in the traps .",
    "( note that the output rate may be relatively high as long as most of the leaked atoms are not actually detected in an interference experiment . )    in this paper , we explore the effects of pumping a two - trap bec system .",
    "we investigate what kind of steady states may be reached when pumping is included , and study the competing effects of the collisions and measurements in such a steady state .",
    "we also allow output couplers on each trap as discussed above .",
    "we explore two types of pumping from thermal atom baths coupled to each trap . in the first ,",
    "we allow two - way pumping where atoms are exchanged with the baths in both directions .",
    "such a scheme was considered for a single - trap atom laser based on evaporative cooling by wiseman @xmath0 _",
    "al  _ @xcite . in the second model",
    ", atoms may enter the traps from a thermal bath , but the reverse process is forbidden . this kind of irreversible pumping scheme has been considered in an atom laser model by holland _",
    "et al  _ @xcite .",
    "we can then consider our whole system as a means of transferring non - condensate atoms in a thermal bath , into two coherent beams with the coherence established by the detection process . in this sense ,",
    "the system might be considered a primitive two - beam atom laser .",
    "we emphasize though , that in this paper we include no line - narrowing element , a central component of true optical lasers  @xcite .",
    "the linewidth of the output beams would be at least that of the output couplers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : ingreds ] we describe our model in detail while in section  [ sec : state ] we discuss the nature of the entangled state more fully . using monte - carlo wave function simulations ,",
    "we consider pumping from a thermal bath of atoms in section  [ sec : steady ] examining the visibility and other parameters , when the pumping of the trap is either two - way or inwards - only .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : collapses ] , we turn to the phenomenon of collapses and revivals of the condensate phase and present some interesting effects associated with pumping .",
    "we now set out the model in full detail . in all the work below we assume a system of two traps containing condensates with occupation numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "we occasionally write @xmath3 to indicate either trap .",
    "atoms may leak from either trap and be detected below at a mean rate @xmath4 establishing a relative phase .",
    "( we assume that an atom in either trap has the same probability of detection ) .",
    "the traps are pumped from two thermal reservoirs containing @xmath5 and @xmath6 non - condensate atoms with rate coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . at different points in the paper",
    ", we assume that atoms may move either in both directions between the traps and reservoirs , or only into the traps , so that we define separate rates @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the simplest systems",
    ", we would expect @xmath13 but the inclusion of some irreversible pumping process can prevent atoms escaping from the trap into the baths giving @xmath14 one example would be to couple the thermal bath to an excited trap level @xmath15 . an atom in @xmath16 can decay to the bec  mode @xmath17 by spontaneous emission . if the medium is optically thin , the emitted photon is lost and excitation out of the ground state is impossible .",
    "we see in section  [ sec : steady ] that this one - way pumping leads to quite different behavior to the two - way pumping .",
    "the physical validity of the two types of thermal pumping has been discussed at some length in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also allow a separate leak from each trap into an empty mode at rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 to act as `` output '' beams .",
    "while we here leave the mechanism unspecified , we note that several techniques for creating an output coupler have been demonstrated by the mit group  @xcite in which rf signals or a bias in the trapping field are used to couple a portion of the condensate to untrapped spin states  @xcite .",
    "finally , the atoms in each trap experience collisions amongst themselves at a rate @xmath20    the master equation for the system may thus be written @xmath21 + \\gamma \\int_{0}^{2\\pi } d\\left [ \\psi \\left ( \\phi \\right ) \\right ] \\,d\\phi \\,\\rho + \\chi _ { 1}^{\\text{out}}\\left ( n_{1}+1\\right ) d\\left [ a_{1}\\right ] \\rho + \\chi _ { 1}^{\\text{in}}n_{1}d\\left [ a_{1}^{\\dag } \\right ] \\rho   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\chi _ { 2}^{\\text{out}}\\left ( n_{2}+1\\right ) d\\left [ a_{2}\\right ] \\rho + \\chi _ { 2}^{\\text{in}}n_{2}d\\left [ a_{2}^{\\dag } \\right ] \\rho + \\nu _ { 1}d\\left [ a_{1}\\right ] \\rho + \\nu _ { 2}d\\left [ a_{2}\\right ] \\rho , \\label{eq : master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian describing collisions amongst the atoms is  @xcite @xmath22 ,   \\label{eq : hamil}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 is the annihilation operator for an atom in trap @xmath24 also , for an arbitrary operator @xmath25 the superoperator @xmath26 \\rho $ ] is defined by @xmath27 \\rho = c\\rho c^{\\dag } -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( c^{\\dag }",

    "it has been shown elsewhere  @xcite that this may always be written in the form    @xmath35    where the conditional visibility @xmath36 and conditional phase @xmath37 are determined by the previous history of the system .    in order that the average number of atoms in the traps become constant in time for the thermal pumping schemes , we require a relation between the various coefficients in the master equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "assuming equal detection and pumping rates for traps 1 and 2 , the pumping rates must satisfy    * for two - way pumping with @xmath38 @xmath39 * for one - way pumping with @xmath40 and @xmath41@xmath42    note that for @xmath43 the two - way pumping rate @xmath44 is larger than the one - way rate @xmath45 by a factor of approximately @xmath46 in the one - way case , on average one atom is added for each atom detected or lost to an output coupler , while in the two - way case , on average _ all _ the trapped atoms are exchanged with the reservoirs for every loss by detection or output coupling .",
    "this difference has important consequences below .",
    "our main interest in this paper is to find the equilibrium state of the model just described , under a variety of conditions and explore the different influences of detection , pumping and collisions .",
    "for example , we naturally expect increasing collisions to reduce the phase coherence and drive the state towards a narrower number distribution . in preparation , however , we should first discuss the nature of the entangled state and our methods for characterizing it more fully .    in earlier studies that consider only detection of the atoms  @xcite , the initial state is normally taken as the product state @xmath47 with @xmath1 atoms in trap 1 and @xmath2 atoms in trap 2 .",
    "the unnormalized state following a single detection with phase @xmath32 is found by applying the field operator @xmath48 : @xmath49 by extension , after @xmath50 detections the state has the form @xmath51 where the @xmath52 are functions of the phases of all the detected atoms @xmath53 if collisions are included , the state experiences unitary evolution under the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) in between detections and the coefficients @xmath54 are also functions of time .",
    "here , with the inclusion of pumping the situation is similar , but as one can continue to detect atoms indefinitely , the entangled state can become very large  ( note of course that the number of detections @xmath55 can now arbitrarily exceed the initial occupancy of the traps ) .",
    "it becomes more natural to drop the dependence on @xmath50 and write the state at time @xmath56 as @xmath57 this is an approximate relation because we truncate the sum at some cut - off @xmath58 this is particularly important numerically as the exact state can become prohibitively large for calculations .",
    "such a truncation is possible because the probability of all detections occurring from a single trap is small ( assuming the initial trap occupancies are not wildly different ) and hence the coefficients at the extreme ends of the entangled state are negligible . in our simulations , we drop terms for which @xmath59 we characterise the state in terms of the mean number of atoms in each trap , and the width of the number difference distribution with the natural definition @xmath60 frequently we also wish to describe the phase distribution for which we use the width  @xcite @xmath61 for a minimum uncertainty state , we have @xmath62 aside from the evolution of the conditional visibility , our main interest below is in the behavior of these two measures of the state .",
    "we now turn to finding the steady states of our system . with thermal pumping schemes",
    "however , a genuine steady state is achieved only for an average over many trajectories . for a given set of parameters ,",
    "each trajectory differs not only in the actual relative phase established between the two traps , but more importantly , in the instantaneous atom numbers as a function of time .",
    "as the trajectory simulation proceeds , the occupancy of each trap exhibits thermal fluctuations which lead to time variations in other properties of the system such as the conditional visibility .",
    "only the time - averaged properties approach a true steady state . as discussed in section  [ sec : ingreds ] , we treat two cases : two - way pumping in which atoms may be exchanged between the bath and trap in both directions , and one - way pumping in which atoms can only move from the bath into the trap .",
    "we begin with representative plots of the visibility as a function of time for a single trajectory with no collisions @xmath63 the visbility for two - way pumping is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoway]a . there are initially @xmath64 atoms in each trap and the pumping rate is chosen to balance the detection rate . on average ,",
    "@xmath65 atoms are detected in a time @xmath66 the visibility is extremely noisy with frequent fluctuations of order 1 .",
    "our simulations show the occupancies of the traps also display large fluctuations as would be expected for coupling to thermal baths in particular , a zero in the visibility is always associated with a zero in one or other of the atom numbers . the visibility for a typical trajectory with one - way pumping",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoway]b . in this case",
    ", there are again large fluctuations but on a much longer time scale .",
    "this difference has a simple origin mentioned earlier : for the one - way case , on average one atom is added to the system for each atom detected and so all the atoms are replaced once in time @xmath67 . in the two - way case ,",
    "@xmath68 atoms are exchanged with the baths for each atom detected , and so in @xmath69 , all the atoms are replaced @xmath68 times over and we expect a correspondingly shorter time scale for the fluctuations . as a comparison , in fig .  [ fig : twoway]c we show a trajectory for a `` regular '' pumping model in which atoms are dripped into the trap at a constant rate to replace those lost by detection . in this case , the collisional rate is @xmath70 but the visibility shows a much improved response than in the ( collisionless ) thermal pumping cases , indicating the severe influence of the thermal pumping .",
    "in fact , the visibility is degraded by the number fluctuations in two distinct ways .",
    "when the occupancy of one of the traps falls due to a fluctuation to within a few times @xmath71 of zero , the extreme terms in the entangled state are removed , the number distribution narrows and the visibility falls . in particular , if one of the traps is completely emptied ( as occurs several times in figs .",
    "[ fig : twoway]a and b , ) the state is then a pure number difference state and any relative phase is completely destroyed .",
    "the visibility can of course be restored once fluctuations increase the atom number again , but there is no relation between the new relative phase and the phase before the trap was emptied .    even when both traps have @xmath72 , the visibility is reduced according to the number difference between the traps .",
    "this is obvious ",
    "if one trap has significantly more atoms than the other , then we can predict with better than 50  % accuracy from which trap the next atom will be detected , and the visibility must fall accordingly .",
    "we can calculate this effect simply as follows . in our system , the atom numbers experience thermal fluctuations in _ time _ due to the pumping .",
    "suppose for a moment we have a different situation in which there is no pumping , and we perform a series of detection runs with a thermal distribution in the _ initial _ trap numbers and measure the visibility after a well - defined relative phase has been set up ( but before the traps are significantly depleted ) .",
    "if we picture the condensates as coherent states with some relative phase : @xmath73 the expected visibility is just @xmath74 which is a familiar expression for optical fields . defining the relative occupancy @xmath75 we have @xmath76 more correctly",
    ", we should derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : betafrel ] ) directly from the entangled state description of the twin - trap system . in general",
    ", the fringe visibility is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the normalized correlation function  @xcite .",
    "while in general , @xmath79 is not easily evaluated for the entangled states with which we are concerned , it can be shown for example that for the projected two - mode coherent state  @xcite @xmath80 which is the most natural expression of a state with relative phase with fixed total atom number @xmath81 @xmath82 tends to unity in the limit of large @xmath81    figures  [ fig : scatter]a and  b test eq .",
    "( [ eq : betafrel ] ) in the form of scatter plots of the points @xmath83 for two - way and one - way pumping respectively with the same parameters as figs  [ fig : twoway]a and b. the prediction  ( [ eq : betafrel ] ) is indicated by the black squares in each plot .",
    "the correlation is clearly much stronger in the one - way case .",
    "this difference is entirely due to the difference in time scales discussed above .",
    "if we are to have a well - defined phase , the number must be partially uncertain .",
    "indeed , we see later that in the presence of collisions the average state has moderate number - squeezing but with a variance of the same order as a coherent state .",
    "so for a reasonable visibility we should require an entangled state of order @xmath84  terms .",
    "such an entangled state is set up by the same number of detections and requires a time of order @xmath85 now for two - way pumping , the time scale for replacement of all the atoms once over is @xmath86 hence , the exchange of atoms with the baths occurs faster than an entangled state of a particular phase can be constructed and we may expect a reduced visibility .",
    "there can be only a weak correlation between the instantaneous visibility and the instantaneous relative occupancy @xmath87 , and the visibility is generally lower than the optimum given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betafrel ] ) . with one - way pumping however , the time scale for replacement of all the atoms is larger by a factor @xmath88 the visibility is able to keep up with the drift in number and is then limited only by  eq .",
    "( [ eq : betafrel ] ) .    we can also calculate the mean visibility over time @xmath89 for an arbitrary pair of mean atom numbers @xmath90 and @xmath91 again , we think of an ensemble of runs with no pumping and a thermal distribution of initial states @xmath92 and @xmath93 the mean visibility over many runs is the weighted average of @xmath94 over the probability distribution [ see eq .",

    "[ fig : pdepend ] , we show the average visibility for a thermal distribution as a function of the mean atom number ratio @xmath107 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betamean ] ) .",
    "the plotted points show the time - averaged visibility calculated from trajectory simulations with one - way pumping and @xmath108 error bars are shown at 1 standard deviation .",
    "as expected , the mean visibility falls with increasing disparity in the mean atom number .",
    "we have seen that the one - way pumping process shows significantly higher visibility than the two - way pumping . from this point on ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the one - way model and add the effect of an output coupler from each trap . in our results",
    "we find two distinct regimes according to the length of the simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : longbeta ] shows the visibility as a function of time averaged over 200 trajectories for a simulation with @xmath109 @xmath110 and an initial state @xmath111 the one - way pumping rate was chosen to maintain the mean population at @xmath64 in each trap .",
    "there are clearly two regimes : for @xmath112 the mean visibility shows a steady decline , while for @xmath113 the visibility tends to a steady - state value of @xmath114 consistent with the calculation of the previous section . in the initial stage of a particular run ,",
    "the populations of the traps become decorrelated due to the thermal nature of the pumping until they are completely uncorrelated and the time - averaged visibility is @xmath115 the time for this decorrelation varies from run to run , having a characteristic length of @xmath116 thus the average over many trajectories shows a gradual decline until all members of the ensemble are likely to be decorrelated .",
    "we are thus led to examine the behavior of the system in the two regimes @xmath117 when the trap populations are likely to be quite close , and @xmath118 when there is no correlation between the populations .",
    "we treat these two cases in turn . in all cases , we start our simulations with the initial state @xmath119 and calculate quantities averaged over 200 trajectories .",
    "* @xmath120 for the short - time regime , we arbitrarily choose @xmath121 to show results .",
    "figure  [ fig : paramshort]a shows the visibility as a function of @xmath122 again averaged over five trajectories",
    ". as expected , the visibility decreases with increasing collisions which increasingly disrupt the relative phase  @xcite .",
    "we have also performed simulations with a range of output couplings from @xmath110 to @xmath123 @xmath124 .",
    "this leads to a small decrease in @xmath36 ( of less than 0.025 for the strongest coupling ) .",
    "this effect is simply a result of the fact that the pumping rate is increased to balance the additional loss of atoms and so the trap populations decorrelate faster .",
    "the nature of the average state of the system is indicated in fig .",

    "are the widths of the number distribution @xmath71 ( dotted line ) and phase distribution @xmath125 ( dot - dashed ) and @xmath126 : the root mean square of the product of the two ( solid ) .",
    "the filled circles denote the actual simulations performed .",
    "the number distribution clearly narrows strongly with increasing collisional rate while the phase distribution spreads as collisions degrade the relative phase .",
    "the simulations with non - zero output coupling ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramshort]b ) produced a reduction of less than 5 % in the number width and no discernible change in the other parameters .",
    "note that for zero collisions , the product of the widths ( solid ) is unity indicating a minimum uncertainty state .",
    "further , for all values of @xmath127 the number width @xmath128 which is the width we would expect if the state was a projection of a coherent state onto a basis of fixed total atom number .",
    "the real state is thus quite strongly number squeezed .",
    "this in consistent with recent analytic work by dunningham _",
    "et al  _ @xcite using a bose - broken symmetry model .",
    "they show that in the limit of a large collisional rate , the true state of the condensate is the amplitude - squeezed state that minimizes number fluctuations . *",
    "@xmath129 in the large time regime , the mean visibility has no dependence on the output coupling rate ",
    "once the atom numbers are completely uncorrelated , the precise rate at which atoms enter the trap is irrelevant .",
    "the number and phase widths shown in figure  [ fig : paramlong ] show very similar trends to the short time case .",
    "note that even with the uncorrelated trap numbers , the state is still minimum uncertainty for @xmath109 indicating that the pumping rate is low enough for the visibility to adjust to changes in number .",
    "again , other simulations showed that the only effect of output coupling was to reduce the number width by a few percent .",
    "in this final section , we consider the application of pumping processes to the interesting phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the relative phase .",
    "several authors have shown that if a relative phase is prepared by detection and the entangled state subsequently evolves purely under the influence of the interatomic collisions , the visibility of the phase experiences recurrent collapses and revivals of period @xmath130 due to the differential rate of phase rotation in the entangled state  @xcite .",
    "a demonstration of collapses and revivals of the phase , perhaps through light scattering experiments , would be a significant result in bec  physics .",
    "it is interesting to consider how the collapses and revivals are affected by pumping and leaking of atoms through the traps .",
    "naively , we might expect that the oscillations would be destroyed by the time all the atoms had been replaced a few times over . in fact , we have found the collapses and revivals to be remarkably robust to pumping processes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse]a , we show the visibility for a single trajectory _ without _",
    "pumping or output coupling in which there are initially 200 detections from a total of 1000 atoms , followed by a period in which the system evolves only under the influence of collisions with @xmath131 .",
    "the oscillations in the visibility are clear .",
    "[ fig : collapse]b shows a trajectory with the same number of detections and collision strength , but with a continual flushing of the trapped atoms by pumping and output coupling . on average , all the atoms are replaced in a period @xmath69 and the atom numbers exhibit large fluctuations ( fig.@xmath132[fig : collapse]c ) . despite this ,",
    "the collapse and revivals persist for a considerable period and only disappear when the atom number in trap 2 ( thick line in fig.@xmath133[fig : collapse]c ) approaches zero at @xmath134 if the trajectory is such that neither atom number approaches zero , the oscillations may continue much longer still .",
    "as the simulation progresses however , while the period of the revivals is unchanged , the peaks broaden  the collapse time increases .",
    "this is associated with the gradual reduction in the width of the number difference of the initial entangled state due to the repeated addition and removal of atoms indicated in fig.@xmath132[fig : collapse]d .",
    "essentially , every addition or removal of an atom through an output coupler tends to drive the state to a narrower number distribution . in their treatment of collapses and revivals for a _",
    "fixed _ number of atoms , wong _",
    "et al_.@xmath132@xcite have shown that the visibility during a collapse should decay according to @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the width of a gaussian approximation to the coefficients @xmath137 and there have been @xmath50 detections from an initial state of @xmath68 atoms in each trap . for a broad distribution , and @xmath138 to lowest order",
    "we have @xmath139 so that in our notation @xmath140 the black squares in fig.@xmath132[fig : collapse]d are estimates of @xmath71 calculated from the collapse widths in fig.@xmath132[fig : collapse]b using eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) .",
    "the agreement with the directly measured values for the width of the number distribution ( solid line ) confirms that the increase in the collapse time is due purely to the change in @xmath141    figure  [ fig : collapse]b also shows a variation in the height of the visibility peaks .",
    "note that the variation is not monotonic , an effect we have found to be generally true .",
    "a natural guess is that the peak heights are associated with the relative occupancy @xmath142 which we found led to a maximum visibility for systems where the detections are _ not _ stopped in section  [ sec : steady ] .",
    "we have tested this using scatter graphs of the peak visibility similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] .",
    "we find a moderate confirmation of the connection . in cases",

    "collapse]b for @xmath143 for which the minima are significantly greater than zero , the correlation is poor and we conclude that the pumping process has produced an additional degradation of the state beyond that implied simply by the mean number difference .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the steady - state behavior for two pumping scenarios to show how an ongoing measurement process can generate a phase coherence between atoms derived from thermal baths , even in the presence of phase diffusion due to atomic collisions within the traps .",
    "we find important qualitative differences between systems with two - way and one - way pumping , the phase coherence being substantially improved for the one - way case .",
    "systems displaying collapses and revivals of the condensate phase should provide an opportunity for examining the time - dependent effects induced by pumping .",
    "we remark finally that a natural extension to our model would be the inclusion of extra trap levels that would allow for line narrowing and genuine laser action .",
