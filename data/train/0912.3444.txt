    "in this paper i would like to give an overview of the study of supersymmetric vacua and bps operators of @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories using the idea of hilbert series ( hs ) .",
    "i will consider as explicit example the super - conformal field theories ( scft ) living on a stack of n d3 branes at the tip of the calabi - yau ( cy ) six dimensional conical singularity @xmath1 .",
    "this kind of `` new '' approach to @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories was born from a set of very simple observations : every @xmath0 supersymmetric field theory has a special subset of operators : the local bps operators , we would like to have a generating function ( hs ) counting them according to their global charges ; the local bps operators are the holomorphic functions over the moduli space : once we know the bps spectrum of the theory we also know its moduli space .",
    "to write down explicit hs counting all the local bps operators of a non - abelian field theory is a rather complicated task and we will refer the interested reader to the original literature @xcite . in this review paper",
    "we would just like to point out that the hs contains a lot of informations related to the field theory , and it is worthwhile to study them . in particular",
    "the hs contains the structure of generators and relations of the chiral ring and it knows about the dimension , the symmetries and the algebraic geometric structure of the complete moduli space .    in the special case of scft",
    "living on d - branes at singularities we can calculate the hs at weak coupling , using field theory , or at strong coupling using string theory and compare the two results . moreover the hs knows about the central charge and the exact r - charges of the elementary fields , it contains part of the kk spectrum in supergravity and the values of the volume of the supergravity compactification manifold h and of some of its supersymmetric three cycles .    with this short introduction",
    "we hope to have motivated the reader to know more about hs . in the following",
    "we will at first introduce our favorite example of supersymmetric theories : the scft living on n d3 branes at the tip of the cy singularity @xmath1 ; we will then divide the study of their chiral ring in @xmath2 and @xmath3 : we will introduce the idea of master space ( ms ) and we will illustrate the generic structure of the hs for n=1 ; we will comment on some of the properties of the ms and will summarize some of the informations we could obtain from the hs .",
    "we will then study the @xmath3 case : we will introduce the idea of plethystic exponential ( pe ) and we will write down the generic form of the hs counting all the local bps operators for generic n for every scft on d3 branes at toric cy singularity ; we will comment on some of its properties and we will explain some of the informations we can obtain from the hs regarding the complete moduli space of the theory for generic n. we will finally analyze , with an explicit example , some of the generalities explained all along the paper , and we will conclude with some comments about other possible applications .",
    "this paper is based on the author s phd thesis @xcite , presented at the infn conference , 21/09/2009 , rome , for the `` premio fubini 2009 '' .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on the scft living on n d3 branes at the tip of cy singularity @xmath1 .",
    "the main reasons for this choice are : they are simple enough to obtain explicit and general results , and they are very interesting for at least two reasons : they are the basis of very interesting phenomenological models that embed generalizations of the mssm and susy breaking mechanisms in string theory ; and they all have a strong coupling description in the ads / cft correspondence : type iib string theory on @xmath4 .    the low energy dynamics of d3 branes at @xmath5 is a quiver gauge theory @xcite : it is an @xmath0 supersymmetric field theory with a manifold of ir superconformal fixed points , it has gauge group @xmath6 , chiral bifoundamental matter fields , and a particular form for the superpotential . for simplicity we will always assume that the singularity @xmath5 is toric , meaning that it admits at least a @xmath7 isometry . in this case",
    "there is a rather complete dictionary between the field theory and the dual geometry .",
    "the natural presence of chiral fields is what makes these theories phenomenologically interesting . indeed generalizing a bit this setup one can reproduce very interesting mssm - like scenario , susy - breaking , renormalization group flows and confinement",
    ", moreover they are nice models to study non - perturbative instanton processes that could produce some perturbatively forbidden couplings like some mass terms or yukawa interactions .",
    "on the other end the ads / cft correspondence claims that the field theory living on n d3 branes at the @xmath1 singularity is dual , in a strong / weak coupling sense , to type iib string theory propagating on the @xmath8 background with n unit of flux : @xmath9 .",
    "we would like to study two main objects of these field theories : their moduli spaces and their bps operators for generic n number of d branes .",
    "the moduli space @xmath10 is the variety of expectation values of the scalar fields that do not break the supersymmetry ; the local bps operators are local gauge invariant operators @xmath11 killed by half of the supercharges @xmath12 .",
    "the gauge group factors are su(n ) groups and they admit two kinds of invariant tensors : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge invariant operators constructed contracting the elementary bifoundamental fields with the @xmath15 are trace - like and are called mesonic operators , while the operators obtained using the @xmath16 are determinant - like and are called baryonic operators .",
    "these are the two kinds of bps operators we want to study .",
    "the global symmetries of these scfts come from the geometry of @xmath5 .",
    "there exist two different types of symmetries : the mesonic ones coming from the isometries of @xmath5 and the baryonic ones under which only the determinant like operators are charged and coming from the topology of three cycles of h.    the setup of d branes at singularity has a set of nice properties that will make easier our analysis .",
    "a first crucial observation is that at least a part of the moduli space of the gauge theory is explicitly realized in the geometry .",
    "indeed some of the scalar degrees of freedom parameterizing the moduli space @xmath17 must also parameterize the space transverse to the branes . in the abelian case we just have one d3 brane and it is just a free point in the transverse geometry , hence the moduli space of the theory must contain at least the six dimensional singularity @xmath5 . in the generic non - abelian case we have n d3 branes that , being mutually supersymmetric , will behave as a set on n non - interacting particles on @xmath5 . because the ground state of the d3 branes is bosonic we have a system of n bosons and the non - abelian moduli space must contain the n - times symmetric product of the transverse singularity : sym@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the group of permutations of n objects acting on the n factors @xmath5 .",
    "these nice properties allow for geometrical intuition and subdivide the problem in n=1 and @xmath3 .",
    "our path to understand the complete spectrum of local bps operators and the full moduli space @xmath20 will be somehow an unusual path : we want to compute hs !    the set of holomorphic functions over the moduli space @xmath17 is exactly the set of all local bps operators of the gauge theory .",
    "we want to construct a function that encode the informations of the chiral ring of the theory .",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "the gauge theory has generically @xmath21 global abelian symmetries : @xmath22 coming from the isometries of @xmath5 , the mesonic symmetries , and @xmath23 baryonic symmetries : anomalous and non - anomalous , coming from the @xmath24 factors inside the @xmath25 of the uv description of the quiver gauge theory that decouple in the ir superconformal fixed points ; the ones associated to the three cycles in h are the non - anomalous ones .",
    "we want to count the bps operators according to their charges under these various @xmath24s .",
    "let us introduce a set of @xmath21 chemical potentials @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we would like to have a function that once expanded for small values of the chemical potentials @xmath28 gives the numbers @xmath29 of bps operators with charges @xmath30 under the corresponding global abelian symmetries . in the mathematical literature",
    "this function is called the hilbert series of @xmath17 , and it is actually counting the holomorphic function over the algebraic variety @xmath17 according to their charges under the action of its symmetry group .",
    "in general @xmath17 has a nice symplectic quotient description : it is the quotient of the algebraic variety @xmath31 defined by the derivatives of the superpotential with respect to the elementary fields ( f - flatness conditions ) by the complexified gauge group @xmath32 : @xmath33 this description of the moduli space clearly individuate a parent space @xmath31 , that we will call the master space ( ms ) of the theory @xcite , and it will be very useful to study the full moduli space @xmath20 for generic n. the ms is a gauge dependent space that can be associated to every @xmath0 field theory , it is simpler than the full moduli space and we could start enjoying to classify its properties . in the case of d3 branes at @xmath5",
    "it turns out that the knowledge of just a subset of the ms for one brane is enough to obtain the hs counting bps operators for generic n !",
    "let us start discussing the abelian n=1 case .",
    "the plan will be the following : we will fully characterize the moduli space in the abelian case and we will then explain the generic structure of the hs ( [ hsintro ] ) for one brane . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the non - abelian case .    with just one brane",
    "we are left with a set of @xmath34 groups , the gauge dynamics is trivial and @xmath35 .",
    "the ms @xmath36 is the complete moduli space of the theory and contains as a sub set ( the locus where all the baryonic operators have zero vacuum expectation value ) the geometrical six dimensional transverse singularity @xmath5 .",
    "the master space is a @xmath37 fibration over @xmath5 with the fiber structure induced by the baryonic symmetries .",
    "it is nice to observe that @xmath36 has a very rich structure :    * @xmath35 is a @xmath21 dimensional toric variety , and can be completely characterized in term of algebraic geometry . in particular",
    "@xmath36 is generically reducible in * * a @xmath21 dimensional component @xmath38 that is a toric calabi yau cone , * * and a set of lower dimensional generically linear components @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath38 has the rigid structure already explained and moreover it has nice transformation properties under seiberg dualities and a defined meaning in the dual string theory / strongly coupled description .",
    "a case by case analysis shows instead that the lower dimensional spaces @xmath39 are less constrained , even if one can show that they could parameterize a subclass of rg flows of the theory . for these reasons we would like to concentrate on @xmath38 , that indeed turn out to be the variety containing the necessary informations to obtain the bps spectrum for generic n.",
    "we know that @xmath38 is the fibration : @xmath40 , where the fiber are generated by the baryonic symmetries of the theory , while the isometries of the base space @xmath41 are the mesonic symmetries .",
    "let us define @xmath42 the vector of non - anomalous baryonic charges and @xmath43 the generic chemical potential associated both to the mesonic and the baryonic symmetries .",
    "it is natural to guess that the hs for @xmath38 admits a decomposition in sectors having a different set of baryonic charges : @xmath44 where for every fixed values of @xmath42 the function @xmath45 counts all the operators with fixed non - anomalous baryonic charges and all the possible mesonic charges ; and @xmath46 are some multiplicities : the number of different operators with the same values all non - anomalous charges . if we consider only the non - anomalous baryonic charges the multiplicity @xmath46 is in general a complicated function , if instead we consider also the anomalous charges the multiplicity is always one .",
    "the non - anomalous charges are of course the good quantum variables , but we will see that the addition of the anomalous charges will be useful to study interesting properties of the non - abelian spectrum and of the non - abelian moduli space .    one can verify that the hs actually decomposes as in ( [ g1intro ] ) .",
    "we can compute it in at least two ways .",
    "we can calculate the left end side of ( [ g1intro ] ) using the field theory and some algebraic geometric techniques , and then perform some king of generalized laurent expansion in the baryonic charges @xcite .",
    "alternatively we can compute it directly on the gravity side @xcite . to every bps operators",
    "one can associate a quantum state of a d3 brane wrapped over a three cycle in h. if the three cycle is trivial the corresponding operator will be a mesonic operator ; if the three cycle is non - trivial the associated operator is a baryonic operator .",
    "there exist an infinite number of states of d3 branes wrapped in h. indeed every section of every possible line bundle over @xmath5 individuates a suspersymmetric embedding of a d3 brane .",
    "the topology of the cycle fixes the baryonic charges @xmath42 and using an index theorem we can compute @xmath45 counting all the sections of the associated line bundle according to their charges under the isometry of @xmath5 .",
    "the multiplicities @xmath46 can be computed instead using the kahler cone and the quiver combinatoric .",
    "we address the interested reader to the original papers , here we just want to point out that ( [ g1intro ] ) can be computed for every scft on d3 branes at singularities both in field theory and in the dual gravity side , and the two results agree .",
    "@xmath47 contain very interesting informations :    * @xmath48 is the mesonic partition function , it contains the structure of the algebraic equations defining the variety @xmath5 and part of the kk spectrum of the supergravity reduction over h ; * taking a limit and minimizing @xmath49 , for generic @xmath42 , we can obtain the volume of h , and for @xmath50 the volumes of all the possible non - trivial three cycles @xmath51 in h. moreover using the ads / cft correspondence we obtain the value of the central charge a and of the r - charge for every elementary field at the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "we would like now to discuss the bps operators in the non - abelian case .",
    "the step from n=1 to generic n is rather non - trivial due to the non - abelian dynamics and the non - trivial finite - n relations among the bps operators . moreover",
    "a direct computation of the hs in the field theory side becomes computationally prohibitive around n=3 . in this section",
    "we want to point out that the knowledge of the geometrical structure of @xmath38 , namely its symmetries and its hs decomposition ( [ g1intro ] ) , is enough to obtain the hs counting all the local bps operators for generic n and to obtain some interesting informations about the non - abelian moduli space @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "as we have already explained the geometric intuition for the d3 brane system induce to think that to pass from n=1 to generic n we need to consider some sort of n - times symmetric product .",
    "the direct analysis of the generic bps operator and the geometric quantization of the dual d3 brane state in presence of n units of flux , support this guess and define the precise meaning of the n - times symmetric product .",
    "the moduli space @xmath20 is non - toric and non - cy .",
    "it can be described as a @xmath52 fibration over the mesonic moduli space : @xmath53 . to explicitly write down the generic form of the hs of @xmath20 , it is useful to introduce a special function called the plethystic exponential : pe@xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it is the generating function for the order n - symmetric products . indeed",
    "the plethystic exponential ( pe ) evaluated on a function @xmath55 , counting a certain set of operators , generates the functions @xmath56 counting all the possible n - times symmetric product of the operators counted by @xmath55 .",
    "let us introduce the chemical potential @xmath57 , we define the plethystic exponential pe@xmath58 as : @xmath59 = \\exp\\left ( \\sum\\limits_{r=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\nu^r g_1(t^r)}{r}\\right ) = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty g_n(t ) \\nu^n.\\ ] ]    using the pe we will easily pass from n=1 d brane to generic n d branes .",
    "moreover the pe has an inverse function called the plethystic logarithm ( pl@xmath60 ) : acting with the on a generating function we obtain the generating series for the generators and the relations in the chiral ring .    to pass to the generic n case we just need to construct the partition function counting all the possible n times symmetric products of the functions counted by @xmath49 .",
    "the pe plays exactly this role .",
    "the hilbert series counting the bps operators for arbitrary number n of branes is obtained from ( [ g1intro ] ) applying the pe to every fixed @xmath42 sector : @xmath61\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the hilbert series counting the bps operators for n d3 branes .",
    "once we have @xmath62 we can expand it in power of the chemical potential @xmath43 and obtain the numbers of independent local bps operators for every values of the charges .",
    "we could also look for large charges limits to study thermodynamical properties of the quiver theory @xcite , or we can apply the pl to @xmath62 and study the structure of generators and relations in the chiral ring @xcite .",
    "summarizing : the study of the ms for just one brane gave us the tools to compute partition functions counting bps operators for arbitrary number n of branes for every scft living on n d3 branes at the tip of @xmath5 .",
    "the nice surprises are not finished yet .",
    "the bps operators are the holomorphic functions over the moduli space @xmath20 and knowing the complete spectrum of bps operators is equivalent to know the full moduli space . following this line of thinking",
    "it is clear that @xmath62 can teach us something about @xmath20 .",
    "once again the ms can help to obtain informations about @xmath20 .",
    "sometimes the ms @xmath38 for just one d3 brane has some symmetries not manifest in the uv lagrangian describing the field theory ; we call them hidden symmetries",
    ". these symmetries are typically non - abelian extensions of some anomalous or non - anomalous baryonic @xmath24 symmetries .",
    "it is nice to observe that the symmetries of the moduli space @xmath20 can be naturally studied with the help of the hs ( [ nhs ] ) . indeed sometime",
    "it is possible to reorganize the spectrum of bps operators in multiplets of the hidden symmetries in such a way that the hs for the @xmath2 master space will be explicitly written in term of characters @xmath63 of these symmetries .",
    "if it is the case , it would imply that the bps operators are in representation of the symmetries of @xmath38 .",
    "we just learned how to pass from one brane to generic n. if we are able to reorganize the generating functions @xmath62 , for the non - abelian case , in representations of the global symmetries guessed form the abelian case , we could claim that both the bps operators and the complete moduli space @xmath20 , for generic @xmath64 , have the hidden symmetries of the n=1 master space @xmath38 .    indeed in a case by case analysis it is possible to show that , if we introduce a set of chemical potentials @xmath65 , @xmath27 parameterizing the cartan sub - algebra of the hidden symmetries group , it is sometime possible to rewrite the hs of @xmath20 in such a way that it will have a nice expansion in characters : @xmath66    we could try to use the tools we just developed to study other problems , and we will comment about some applications in the conclusions .",
    "right now we would like to give an easy explicit example to illustrate some of the general points explained in the main text .",
    "till now the discussion was quite abstract , let us try to give an explicit example .",
    "we choose to study the low energy field theory living on n d3 branes at the tip of the complex cone over @xmath67 .",
    "this particular surface is called the zeroth hirzebruch surface @xmath68 .",
    "the field theory can be nicely represented by the quiver diagram in figure [ f0 ] . to every small circle we associate an su(n ) gauge group factor , and to every arrow from su(n)@xmath69 to su(n)@xmath70 we associate a chiral field @xmath71 charged under the foundamental of su(n)@xmath69 ad the anti - foundamental of su(n)@xmath70 .     field theory . ]",
    "the superpotential of the theory is : @xmath72 .",
    "let us start with the abelian n=1 case .",
    "the ms @xmath36 can be readily found taking the derivatives of the superpotential .",
    "there are three irreducible pieces : @xmath73 with @xmath74 where @xmath75 means the locus of zero of the polynomials inside the brackets .",
    "the ms has a rich structure .",
    "it is reducible in three irreducible components .",
    "the @xmath38 is @xmath76 dimensional and it is a cone . the complete intersection @xmath77 is a well known toric cy three - fold , it is called the conifold and it has @xmath78 isometry group .",
    "@xmath38 is the product of two conifold and it is indeed a six dimensional cy toric cone .",
    "if we give weight @xmath79 to all the eight basic fields in the quiver the hs of @xmath38 is : @xmath80 let us analyze the symmetries of the field theory . from the form of the quiver and of the superpotential",
    "we can see that there are two mesonic non - abelian @xmath81 : the fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 are doublets of the first @xmath81 , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are doublets of the second @xmath81 . on top of these there are also a non - anomalous @xmath86 r - symmetry under which all the elementary fields have the same @xmath87 charge , and a non - anomalous @xmath88 baryonic symmetry with charge + 1 for the fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and -1 for the fields @xmath84 and @xmath85 . at the classical level there are other two @xmath24s that are actually anomalous in the quantum theory .",
    "we conclude that the classical symmetry of the field theory is : @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath38 is the product of two conifold and has @xmath90 symmetry .",
    "namely the symmetry of the ms is bigger than the symmetry of the lagrangian describing the scft .",
    "we call the new symmetries the hidden symmetries of the theory .",
    "we would like to decompose the hs of @xmath38 in sectors with different baryonic charges as in ( [ g1intro ] ) .",
    "we introduce the chemical potentials @xmath79 and @xmath91 for the r and non - anomalous baryonic charges , and we define the characters @xmath92\\times[m]\\times[p]\\times[q]=[n , m , p , q]$ ] for the @xmath93 representations : the first two brackets for the @xmath94 mesonic symmetries , and the second two brackets for the @xmath94 hidden symmetries .",
    "we can organize the four fields @xmath95 in the @xmath96 $ ] representation and the four fields @xmath97 in the @xmath98 $ ] representation .",
    "the hs ( [ hsf0 ] ) can be refined with all the chemical potentials and can be written explicitly in @xmath90 covariant form :    @xmath99 t^{\\beta + \\beta ' } b^{\\beta - \\beta ' }   \\label{hsf0ref}\\ ] ]    to write down the decomposition ( [ g1intro ] ) we just need to explicitly write the @xmath93 characters and set to one the chemical potentials associated to the @xmath94 hidden symmetry group .",
    "this last operation would generate the multiplicities @xmath46 .    using the completely refined decomposition of the hs for @xmath38",
    "we can obtain the expression for the hs counting all the local bps operators for generic n , according to their symmetries .",
    "the final result is : @xmath100 \\left ( pe_{\\nu } \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty [ 2 n + \\beta , 2 n + \\beta ' , 0 , 0 ] t^{4 n + \\beta + \\beta ' } b^{\\beta - \\beta ' } \\right ] \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left .   - pe_{\\nu } \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty [ 2 n + \\beta , 2n + \\beta ' , 0 , 0 ] t^{4 n +   \\beta + \\beta ' } b^{\\beta -\\beta ' } \\right ] \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the first pe contains all the terms in the second pe and hence all the coefficients in the expansion are positive .",
    "this is the explicit demonstration that for generic n the chiral spectrum organizes into representations of @xmath101 and , as a consequence , also the moduli space of the non - abelian theory with generic rank n has symmetry @xmath101 . once again",
    "if we want to count the operators according to the non - anomalous symmetries as in ( [ nhs ] ) it is enough to explicitly write down the characters and then set to one the chemical potentials associated to the hidden symmetries .",
    "we tried an alternative algebraic geometrical approach to four dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories .",
    "we make strong use of the concept of master space , hilbert series and plethystic exponential . for the specific setup of d3 branes at cy singularities we got as a result the control over the spectrum of bps operators and its symmetry properties for generic n ; the complete description for the moduli space for one brane , and interesting properties for generic n.    there are many other applications or generalizations of the techniques and results we discussed in these notes . for example it is possible to extend the counting procedure to include also the fermionic operators @xcite , to study marginal deformations of the field theories @xcite or to study the behavior of hs and ms under quantum dualities like seiberg duality @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that , even if the tools we developed work very well for the gauge theories living on d3 branes at cy three - fold , they can easily be applied to other interesting field theories .",
    "some examples are the study of sqcd - like theories @xcite or , more recently , the study of the three dimensional conformal field theories living on m2 branes at cy four - fold singularities @xcite .",
