    "at the same time that the @xmath0 mission was being conceived as nasa s final great observatory ( originally as sirtf ) , results from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) demonstrated that the most luminous galaxies in the universe are dusty and heavily obscured , with most of their luminosity arising from optical and ultraviolet luminosity which is reradiated by the absorbing dust @xcite .",
    "a fundamental motive of @xmath0 was to track the evolution of these luminous galaxies through the history of the universe . in",
    "what follows , we review the success of @xmath0 in achieving this goal .",
    "our conceptual sketch of such an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) is shown in figure 1 and described in the caption .",
    "undoubtedly , starbursts are present to some extent in all such sources .",
    "the starburst ulirgs are the most fertile star forming regions in the universe .",
    "however , the observed characteristics are determined both by the luminosity of the starburst and the luminosity of dust heated by a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . here , we separate the two phenomena to track separately the evolution of starbursts and agn .    the plots and results that we show below derive only from irs low resolution observations .",
    "more detailed diagnostics can be made for those sources with high resolution data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the heavy extinction in the most obscured sources can hide even infrared emission lines arising near the central agn .",
    "for example , the presence of only blueward asymmetries on infrared forbidden lines from heavily obscured uliirg agn indicates that the obscuring dust is thick , even at the scale of the narrow line region of agn @xcite .",
    "in general , the new irs results confirm the initial demonstration by @xcite that strong emission from polyclyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) is associated with starbursts , but not with agn .",
    "the photodissociation region at the interface between the surrounding molecular cloud and the hii region of a starburst provides the appropriate physical conditions for strong pah excitation and emission @xcite .",
    "the hundreds of low resolution spectra accumulated by the irs give an empirical result that `` pure '' starbursts - sources with no evidence in any spectral region of an agn - always have equivalent width for the 6.2 @xmath8 m  pah feature , ew(6.2 @xmath8 m ) , to be ew(6.2 @xmath8 m  ) @xmath7 0.4 @xmath8 m  @xcite .",
    "conversely to starbursts , there are large numbers of sources with irs spectra which are `` pure '' agn , having no evidence in any spectral region of an observationally significant starburst ; these have ew(6.2 @xmath8m)@xmath4 0.1 @xmath8 m .",
    "we have used these simple observational criteria to derive the samples of starbursts and agn presented below , as explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "10 @xmath8 m .",
    "such sources are optically bright and have known redshifts , so irs spectral measures of the dust continuum are made at 7.9 @xmath8 m . the center spectrum is a heavily obscured agn with an apparent spectral peak at 7.9 @xmath8 m  arising because of deep silicate absorption at longer wavelengths and other absorption features at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the dust continuum is measured at this 7.9 @xmath8 m  peak .",
    "the lowest spectrum is a starburst with strong pah features .",
    "starburst luminosity is measured by the peak of the strong 7.7 @xmath8 m  pah feature .",
    "( the illustrated spectra have higher s / n than individual sources actually observed at such redshifts ; spectra which are shown derive from brighter , lower redshift examples . ) ]    our primary motivation for using the simple observational measurement of peak flux densities for the pah 7.7 @xmath8 m  feature in spectra of `` pure '' starbursts or the 7.9 @xmath8 m  spectral peak for `` pure '' obscured agn is to have reliable and self - consistent data for the large numbers of sources discovered by @xmath0 at z @xmath9 2 , for which s / n is poor , and deconvolution of the total flux within spectral features is uncertain .    to measure total infrared luminosities",
    ", we have used as an initial calibration a limited number of ulirgs or starbursts having iras fluxes and irs spectra , so that l@xmath10 can be estimated as in @xcite .",
    "these calibrations , from @xcite , are given in the captions of figures 3 and 4 .",
    "this estimate of l@xmath10 arises only from the iras wavelengths , with an assumed correction for colder dust components , so our calibration will be improved as more far infrared and submillimeter observations accumulate .",

    "the most important results in figures 3 and 4 are that the form of luminosity evolution is very similar for both starbursts and agn , and that no definitive indication is found for the epoch at which luminosity evolution reaches a maximum .",

    "tracing the evolution of star formation in the universe is a fundamental objective of observational cosmology . the star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "can be estimated with many observational techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "starbursts have been observed to the highest redshifts ( z @xmath9 7 ) using rest frame ultraviolet luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but determination of intrinsic source luminosities and true sfrs requires large corrections for obscuration by dust . the availability of infrared spectra showing the pah features , suffering much less extinction than optical or ultraviolet features , allows a new test of obscuration corrections @xcite .",
    "results are shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the dramatic contrast in sfrs that would be measured from the pah 7.7 @xmath8 m  feature , compared to sfrs measured from the ultraviolet continuum ( details in @xcite ) . even for starbursts selected in the ultraviolet ,",

    "figure 6 shows that the extinction is much greater in many infrared selected starbursts , but extinction is still high even in ultraviolet selected starbursts . required corrections for dust obscuration are higher by factors of 2 to 3 than generally assumed for the ultraviolet",
