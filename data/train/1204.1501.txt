    "a nova eruption in a cataclysmic binary star ( cv ) occurs as a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf primary star once it has accumulated a critical mass from its late - type , usually main - sequence , companion . in the process of the eruption",
    ", material is ejected into the interstellar medium .",
    "the mass of the shell typically amounts to @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is recent evidence that the mass of the white dwarf increases in the course of the secular evolution of cvs @xcite .",
    "consequently , in nova eruptions less than the accumulated mass is ejected . with typical mass - transfer rates of a few @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite the typical recurrence time of a nova eruption @xmath4 .",
    "this distinguishes the classical novae from the recurrent novae that have much shorter recurrence times in the order of decades , and in most cases have a giant donor .    in between nova eruptions the binary",
    "is supposed to appear as a  normal \" cv , i.e.  its behaviour is dominated by its current mass - transfer rate and the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hibernation model predicts that most of the time between eruptions the system passes as a detached binary @xcite .",
    "the proposed scenario here is that the binary separation increases due to the mass lost from the white dwarf during the eruption .",
    "the primary is heated by the thermonuclear runaway , thus in return heats the companion star , driving it far out of thermal equilibrium , and so sustaining a high mass - transfer rate in spite of the increased separation .",
    "the mass - transfer rate gradually decreases and eventually the donor can relax to thermal equilibrium , losing contact to its roche lobe , and the system becomes detached . while there is still no observational evidence for the latter part of this scenario , i.e.  the state of actual  hibernation \" ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , it is already well established that old novae are part of the cv class .",
    "for example , the system dq her ( nova her 1934 ) is known as the prototype intermediate polar , while rr pic ( nova pic 1925 ) shows the characteristics of an sw sex system @xcite .",
    "gk per ( nova per 1901 ) seems to be an intermediate polar , revealing , decades after its nova eruption , the typical behaviour of a dwarf nova , with semi - periodic outbursts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of a nova shell around the dwarf nova z cam @xcite proves that ( at least some ) systems discovered as cvs are also old novae .    in spite of these , more or less isolated and exotic , cases",
    ", there is still only a fragmentary knowledge of the generally valid long - term behaviour of classical novae before and after their eruption .",
    "a study based on 97 relatively well observed galactic novae by @xcite revealed a decrease in brightness with a mean slope @xmath5 per year during the first 130 years after the eruption .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite who derived , from a sample of nine very well covered cases , a mean decline rate of @xmath6 per year , half a century after outburst .",
    "this is all our knowledge , at present .",
    "most classical novae have orbital periods between 3 and 6 hours @xcite . in this period range",
    "we find several other classes of cvs , in particular dwarf novae , magnetic cvs , and nova - like variables like sw sex and ux uma stars , most of them characterised by high mass - transfer rates .",
    "do all these cvs suffer nova eruptions ? is the magnetic field of the white dwarf of any importance for the eruption recurrence time ? and",
    "do post - novae really go into hibernation , i.e.  do cvs become detached for a time as a consequence of the nova eruption ?",
    "we do not know , although answering these questions would be rather important for our understanding of cvs .",
    "the only way to progress here would be a more exhaustive investigation of the detailed behaviour of old novae decades and centuries after their outbursts .",
    "as a first step towards this goal , it is necessary to identify the remnants of past novae , especially those which had erupted long time ago .",
    "our knowledge , in this respect , is largely incomplete .",
    "there are about 200 confirmed or suspected novae with eruptions before 1980 , but for less than half of them a spectrum of the post - nova has been obtained .",
    "only for 39 of these , a value for the orbital period is listed .",
    "moreover , eight of these can be regarded as uncertain since they were obtained photometrically without the light curve presenting definite orbital features like eclipses or ellipsoidal variations , two more ( dy pup and di lac ) are based on unpublished data @xcite , and the 5.714 d period of v1017 sgr is marked as  preliminary \" @xcite .",
    "this leaves a mere 28 old novae with a well - established orbital period .    to improve the current situation on systematic research on old novae",
    "we have started a program to identify nova candidates with @xmath7 photometry via their specific colours and to confirm them with low - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently bright systems , we furthermore plan to determine their orbital period by measuring radial velocities obtained with time - series spectroscopy . since our main interest regards the underlying cv we intend to limit our research to novae where the nova shell is already sufficiently faint to provide only a negligible contribution at least to the optical spectrum .",
    "the time scale for the fading of the nova shell will be different for individual systems .",
    "however , a literature research on well - known novae shows that after about 30 years the nebular lines have disappeared from the spectra in almost all systems . in order to facilitate the selection , we therefore limit our study to novae that erupted before 1980 .",
    "we here present the results for ten candidate old novae .",

    "since both the shape and the time scale of the photometric variability as well as the observed difference in magnitude ( @xmath152.5 mag ) are consistent with a mira type light curve lebzelter11 - 1 , we favour the latter possibility , and suggest to remove v1310 sgr from the list of potential classical novae .      the nova was discovered due to its photometric variability that reached a maximum photographic brightness of 6.5 mag as reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite classifies it as a moderately fast nova with @xmath51 .",
    "the eruption light curve is given by @xcite , who furthermore reports a  fairly constant \" brightness of @xmath52 for the pre - nova in the years 19571968 , as well as for the post - nova in 19701972 .",
    "consistent with these findings , @xcite present @xmath53 for the pre - nova in the years 19661967 .",
    "however , in the same time range the authors also find an unusually red and strongly variable colour for this object to @xmath54 . since modern finding charts @xcite show a fairly crowded region of the sky at the given position , it is thus likely that above values for the pre- and post - nova do not represent the nova itself , but rather the combined brightness of the nova and its close visual companions .",
    "supporting this interpretation we find the nova to have a steep blue continuum , and a much fainter brightness than reported of @xmath55 .",
    "emission lines of the balmer and hei series are clearly discernible , albeit comparatively weak .",

    "the spectroscopy reveals a blue continuum and ( for a nova ) comparatively strong balmer and hei emission lines ( fig.[novaspec_fig ] , table [ eqw_tab ] ) .",
    "this system is the one in our sample that looks most like a dwarf nova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but for the blue slope and the presence of a broad bowen / heii component .",
    "the broad and structured balmer emission lines ( fig .",

    "column 5 presents the  age \" of the post - nova , i.e.  the time that has passed from the eruption to the current observations , and column 6 summarises the time @xmath72 in which the nova has declined by 3 magnitudes as taken from @xcite .    in order to examine the sed of the confirmed novae",
    ", we have fitted a power law @xmath81 to the continuum of the dereddened spectra .",
    "we restricted the fit to wavelengths @xmath82 because the continuum bluewards of @xmath83 in many systems is less well defined due to the presence of several emission lines , and also the noise in general increases towards the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "the such derived values for the power - law exponent are given in column 7 of table [ erup_tab ] .",
    "note that the corresponding uncertainty listed there corresponds to the standard deviation of the fit , and does not take into account additional uncertainties concerning the instrumental response function and the dereddening process .",
    "finally , in column 8 we list the full width at half maximum of a gaussian fit to the h@xmath30 line .",
    "we have used this line instead of the stronger and usually better defined h@xmath31 line in order to avoid potential contamination of the shell material .    starting with the sed",
    ", we find that @xmath31 for most systems falls well below the value of 2.33 for a steady - state accretion disc @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who places nova - like cvs in this range , but differs from the results of @xcite who derive an average value of @xmath84 with a standard deviation of @xmath85 for their sample of dereddened post - novae . within our sample",
    ", mt cen stands out by presenting with @xmath86 by far the largest value . in principle",
    "this could mean that this system is dominated by a still hot dwarf , but considering that it was observed 78 years after the eruption , this appears unlikely .",
    "we furthermore note that the largest correction for interstellar extinction had to be used for mt cen .",
    "this might be coincidental , but there is also the possibility that the uncertainties in the dereddening process are the reason behind mt cen s exalted position , and perhaps also behind the difference between our results and @xcite .",
    "another system with an sed significantly different from the others in our sample is v2109 oph , whose continuum can not be fitted by a single power - law , but instead follows different laws for the range redwards of 5900   ( @xmath87 ) and for the range 50005900   ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed by @xcite for the old novae v630 sgr and v842 cen , of which the former is more similar to our case , since it also presents the less steep continuum slope for the blue part of its sed .",
    "the authors interpret their findings as the signature of a disrupted inner accretion disc , and , encouraged by the strong heii emission in the system , suggest that v630 sgr is a magnetic cv . in v2109 oph , however , the heii line is not particularly strong for an old nova , and with the present data there is no reason to suspect magnetic accretion . instead , fig .",
    "[ deredspec_fig ] shows that the continuum slope bluewards of 5000   again increases and appears similar to that redwards of 5900   .",
    "bumpy \" continuum could in principle be the signature of an sed that is dominated by the stellar components instead of the accretion disc .",
    "further evidence for this , e.g.  in the form of stellar absorption lines , however is missing . without further data it therefore remains unclear if the shape of the continuum in v2109 oph is intrinsic or an artifact due to a problem in the extraction or dereddening process .",
    "looking at the eruption amplitudes we find that two systems , v909 sgr and v728 sco , match the criterion of @xcite for a tremendous outburst nova ( ton ) , @xmath89 .",
    "based on the assumption that the absolute eruption magnitude is very similar for all novae the authors ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that a large eruption amplitude indicates a faint post - nova , either because it is seen at high inclination @xcite , or because it is intrinsically faint due to a low mass - transfer rate .",
    "v728 sco could fit into the former category .",
    "it is the only system in our sample whose emission lines are broad enough to be well - resolved ( last column in table [ erup_tab ] ) , and additionally these lines show a distinctive structure ( fig .  [ v728scosp_fig ] ) .",
    "following @xcite a large eruption amplitude and a fast decline can also indicate a magnetic nova , since discless systems , or those with a disrupted disc , should be intrinsically fainter than disc cvs . since v909 sgr additionally presents a particularly strong heii emission , it is a good candidate for this category .",
    "we have conducted a study on ten candidate old novae . among them",
    "we have found two probable mira stars whose variability likely was confused with a nova eruption , and we propose to delete these stars , v1310 sgr and v734 sco , from the list of potential novae .",
    "we have furthermore spectroscopically confirmed seven previously selected candidate post - novae , as well as recovered one system , v728 sco , that was found to be @xmath152@xmath25 away from the reported coordinates .    within the confirmed old novae",
    "we find a group of four objects that  after correction for interstellar reddening ",
    "share very similar spectral properties : mt cen , v655 cra , il nor , and v2572 sgr , all have the blue continuum and the weak emission lines that are typical for high mass - transfer systems .",
    "the remaining four novae instead present at least one pecularity that distinguishes them from the other systems in our sample .",
    "v2109 oph presents a  bumpy \" continuum for which with the current data we do not find an explanation , and v909 sgr shows several trademarks of a magnetic systems .",
    "v812 cen has an unususally strong balmer decrement , and one can assume that the ejected material still contributes to the h@xmath31 emission .",
    "last , not least , v728 sco is the only system in our sample where we find convincing evidence that it has a comparatively high inclination , and it should therefore be possible to derive its orbital period with time - series photometry .",
