    "the concept of topological order  @xcite was initiated in the 80 s with the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect and high temperature superconductivity  @xcite . since then it has also been seen in short range resonating valence bond states  @xcite and in quantum spin liquids  @xcite .",
    "once it s usefulness was realized in solid state quantum computation  @xcite several exactly solvable models have been constructed achieving this .",
    "the classic example emerged when kitaev wrote down the toric code hamiltonian in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "these systems are examples of lattice models which host anyons  @xcite as part of their low energy excitations .",
    "they can also be thought of as particular phases of the @xmath2 lattice gauge theory which host these deconfined excitations with anyonic statistics .",
    "they posses ground states with degeneracies which are topological invariants .",
    "this degeneracy is stable up to the addition of weak perturbations .",
    "this feature makes this model a probable candidate for fault tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "these models have been extended to other discrete groups and involutary hopf algebras as well  @xcite . in these cases",
    "they can be thought of as arising from lattice gauge theories based on these discrete groups or involutary hopf algebras  @xcite .",
    "earlier works showing the existence of anyons in two dimensional discrete gauge theories can be found in  @xcite .",
    "discrete gauge theories emerge in these models when a continuous gauge group breaks down to one via spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "these systems are usually perturbed by adding qudit terms to act on the edges of the lattice which carry the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "they drive the system out of the topological phase  @xcite .",
    "the resulting models are rendered unsolvable analytically and are thus subject to study using numerical methods .",
    "however by considering restricted plaquette and vertex operators they can be made solvable .",
    "such studies were carried out in  @xcite .",
    "this resulted in condensed phases of the quantum double model .",
    "these works were crucial in understanding the stability of these topological phase represented by the quantum double model .",
    "it is thus an important problem to find exactly solvable models which remain in topological phases in the presence of these perturbations .    in this spirit",
    "we introduce exactly solvable models which are constructed by looking at possible hamiltonians that can be generated using the transfer matrices of such systems .",
    "we show exactly solvable models which include the single qudit perturbations . the cases of abelian and non - abelian groups are studied separately .",
    "it is shown that in the abelian case the system remains in the topological phase corresponding to the quantum double model .",
    "the situation turns out different for the non - abelian cases .",
    "we find that the model remains in a topological phase but it is in a modified version with respect to the corresponding topological phase of the quantum double model .",
    "these are seen by studying the examples of the group algebras of @xmath0 and @xmath1 denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "we then go beyond the transfer matrices of lattice gauge theories by introducing more parameters in the transfer matrix of lattice gauge theories to find other topological phases .",
    "this transfer matrix is made up of two - qudit operators apart from the usual operators making up the transfer matrix of lattice gauge theories .",
    "we work with the @xmath5 case to show how one can obtain the double semion phase from such considerations . for more general groups",
    "these transfer matrices contain the twisted quantum double models as defined in  @xcite .",
    "such models were also defined in  @xcite while considering trivial global symmetry groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the transfer matrices of two dimensional lattice gauge theories .",
    "the local operators used to build these transfer matrices and the parameters used to study phase transitions between different phases is explained here .",
    "hamiltonians of two dimensional lattice models are obtained from these transfer matrices by taking their logarithms .",
    "this can be done in different ways resulting in several models .",
    "these include exactly solvable models and models which can not be solved analytically .",
    "the models of interest are presented in section 3 .",
    "their excitations along with their braiding statistics and fusion rules are studied in section 4 .",

    "the system is defined on a two dimensional lattice @xmath6 with gauge degrees of freedom located on the links of this lattice .",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom belong to the group algebra of a gauge group @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 , with basis elements @xmath9 and multiplication rule given by @xmath10 .",
    "thus the states on the links are given by linear combinations of @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath5",
    "this is nothing but the familiar two state system given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath14 is also discretized with elements of the algebra @xmath8 living on the links .",
    "this can be used to construct partition functions for this system by associating weights to links and faces of the closed triangulated 3-manifold @xmath14 in the spirit of state - sum models  @xcite .",
    "however when @xmath14 is not closed the tensors associated to the weights have non contracted indices at the ends of the unit time interval giving us transfer matrices . such a procedure was used to construct transfer matrices of lattice gauge theories in  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite the partition function , and hence the transfer matrix , was built out of structure constants of the algebra @xmath17 , which in this case is given by @xmath8 , as the weights associated to links and plaquettes .",

    "this imposes the following conditions on the coefficients @xmath205 and @xmath206 & = & + & = & + & = & 1 .    using these conditions it is easy to check that the fusion and braiding rules for the operator creating the fluxes is that of the double semion phase .",
    "we have used modified transfer matrices of 3d lattice gauge theories with discrete gauge groups to find exactly solvable quantum models in two dimensions .",
    "the abelian cases were studied with the example of the @xmath0 groups and were shown to generate a quantum phase identical to the quantum double phase based on the group algebra of these abelian groups .",
    "this was seen by studying the excitations of these systems .",
    "the excitations were the same as the @xmath0 anyon models .",
    "the only change was in the operator creating these excitations . in the case",
    "when the vertex operators were modified the flux excitations were created by new operators whereas in the case where the plaquette operators were modified the operators creating the charge excitations were modified .",
    "thus these models present another example of a system hosting @xmath0 anyons on the two dimensional lattice .",
    "there have been other examples of exactly solvable lattice models which host the @xmath0 anyons  @xcite .",
    "the important point about the models presented in this paper is that they involve terms which are usually added as perturbations on the links to induce quantum phase transitions of the @xmath0 quantum double models .",
    "the models remain solvable in spite of including these terms .",
    "the only difference is that the modified vertex and plaquette operators obey a deformed version of the quantum double algebra .",
    "it is interesting question to find out if a suitable choice of a representation category can generate these models using the string - net formalism  @xcite .",
    "the story changes when the discrete groups are non - abelian .",
    "the example of the dihedral group @xmath1 was studied and the phase was found to be different from that of the corresponding quantum double phase . in particular the phase was found to be a modified version of the @xmath1 quantum double phase .",
    "the abelian charge was no longer an excitation of the system instead it condensed to the ground state .",
    "the flux excitations corresponding to the @xmath72 $ ] conjugacy class is not existent that is can not be expanded in the set of excitations of the system .",
    "similar models were studied in  @xcite where they add the magnetic terms to the links just like perturbations .",
    "the plaquette operators were considered to be projectors to a normal subgroup of the full gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting phases in  @xcite are condensed versions of the @xmath1 quantum double phase .",
    "the construction of the transfer matrices for two dimensional lattice gauge theories was shown in  @xcite .",
    "in particular it was shown to contain the quantum double models for any involutory hopf algebra .",
    "the models in  @xcite were found by trivializing the @xmath105 and @xmath169 parameters .",
    "this implies there were no perturbation terms included in the transfer matrices considered in  @xcite .",
    "the models considered in this paper can be considered as an extension of the formalism presented in  @xcite where we make non - trivial choices for the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath169 .",
    "condensed phases of abelian quantum double models were exhibited in  @xcite .",
    "the models considered in this paper can be regarded as another way to obtain condensed phases along lines similar to  @xcite .",
    "the models considered in this paper included only four spin couplings .",
    "we could include more couplings which will result in more complicated models .",
    "for example if we couple a plaquette with the legs of the plaquette we can obtain models similar in spirit to the double semion model  @xcite . however we can not use the transfer matrix in eq.([tz2 ] ) to obtain the double semion model .",
    "the reason being that there are no choices of parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 which will result in this model .",
    "this calls for the construction of more general transfer matrices which can lead to these kinds of models . in section 5",
    "we showed how we can go about finding the double semion phase by including two - qudit operators in the transfer matrix of lattice the gauge theory .",
    "we only worked out the case of @xmath5 in this section . for other groups",
    "this reduces to the twisted quantum double models constructed in  @xcite .",
    "these models can be thought of as arising due to the introduction of new parameters to the vertices which we denoted as @xmath173 .",
    "hence it is natural to use @xmath172 to obtain the models dual to the twisted quantum double models .",
    "we will explore these in future works .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transfer matrix approach provides a variety of lattice gauge models including topological and non - topological ones .",
    "this approach may very well be appropriate for studying quantum phase transitions in these lattice models .",
