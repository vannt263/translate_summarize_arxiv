    "8 shows that the inferred mass loss rates are almost independent of the amount of circumstellar dust and stellar luminosity .",
    "also there is not any obvious trend with metallicity within the scatter .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noticing that while the stars in the intermediate and metal rich clusters span the whole range of measured mass loss values , the two metal poor stars of m15 have rather high rates , despite the relative low content of dust ( cf .",
    "this is not surprising since one expects that among the most metal poor objects only those with large mass loss rates can have detectable dust .",
    "the blue tail hb morphology of m15 also shows that some of its stars ( if genuine post - rgb stars ) have lost almost their entire envelope on the rgb .",

    "dust grains are very efficient in absorbing and scattering starlight and could contribute to driving or accelerating stellar winds",
    ". however , as widely discussed in the recent review by willson ( 2000 ) , pure stationary flow models seem inadequate to describe the mass loss phenomena since a strongly dust - driven wind in an oxygen - rich star requires large light - to - mass ratios ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "only the coolest and most luminous agb stars with direct signatures of dusty winds possibly satisfy this criterion .",
    "if winds are dust driven , non - steady phenomena like pulsational effects must be invoked to drive or enhance a stellar wind and to promote dust formation .",
    "the role of pulsating atmospheres in agb mass loss has been considered for many years both on theoretical and observational basis ( cf .",

    "however , interpreting h@xmath56 emission can be complicated ( dupree 1986 ) .",
    "for example , dupree et al . (",
    "1994 ) suggest from its time variability that h@xmath56 emission is due to atmospheric shocks which might drive the mass loss . in either interpretation",
    "the presence of h@xmath56 emission in rgb spectra would generally indicate ongoing mass loss .    in the star in which mass loss is best understood , the sun , the mass loss mechanism",
    "is ultimately tied to the magnetic field generated by the convective zone ( e.g. , dupree 1986 ) . since cluster rgb stars have convective zones they could well have magnetic fields .",
    "there are no direct measurements of such fields , and interpreting signatures of chromospheric activity which might arise from magnetic fields is quite complex ( e.g. , ayres et al .",
    "there is some recent evidence for rgb starspots which would imply magnetic activity ( stefanik et al .",
    "soker ( 2000 ) and garca - segura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that magnetic activity might play a role in agb mass loss on the basis of planetary nebula morphology .",
    "some non - canonical deep mixing in the upper rgb has been also invoked to produce excess luminosities and enhancing the mass loss close to the rgb - tip ( cf .",
    "e.g. sweigart 1997 ; cavallo & nagar 2000 , weiss , denissenkov & charbonnel 2000 ) , but a solid physical picture of the overall impact on the red giant evolution is still lacking .",
    "can our observations give further information on the rgb mass loss process ?    according to our mid - ir survey , strong mass loss processes seem to occur only close to the rgb - tip , during the last few million years of the rgb lifetime at @xmath57 ( fusi pecci & renzini 1975 ; salaris & cassisi 1997 ) .",

    "we will refer to the fraction of the time that mass loss is `` on '' as @xmath58 .",
    "the fraction of time that the mass loss is `` off , '' or has dropped below our detection threshold , is @xmath59 . since of the 52 isocam sources 20 show evidence for mass loss , a first global estimate is @xmath60 .",
    "considering the small numbers , there is no evidence that @xmath61 for the individual clusters varies from this global value .",
    "things are not so simple . in principle , all the stars brighter than @xmath57 in each cluster should have been detected . in practice , due to the broad isocam psf , some stars are missed .",
    "first , while there is sometimes more than one star within an isocam point source psf , we selected only the brightest .",
    "second , in the dense cores of m15 & ngc  6388 it is not possible to associate the isocam objects with any near - ir stellar counterpart .",
    "the number of lost stars basically depends on the crowding , and thus on both the cluster distance and density  the larger their values the larger the number of stars in each pixel field of view , other things being constant .    to estimate the number of missed stars , we have computed the expected number of giants brighter than @xmath62 within the isocam field of view in two ways .",
    "first we used a theoretical approach : the fraction of light within the isocam beam , was computed using a king model and the _ specific evolutionary flux _ by renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) , assuming an average lifetime @xmath63 myr at @xmath57 ( fusi pecci & renzini 1975 ; salaris & cassisi 1997 ) .",
    "as an alternative we counted the number of stars detected in our @xmath64 survey within the same beam .",
    "the two methods provide similar results ( within 20% ) .",
    "the numbers are given in table  2 .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the corresponding number of isocam point sources detected in each cluster , as expected given the wide isocam psf .    how can the missed stars affect our estimate of @xmath61 ? the missed stars may or may not be losing mass .",
    "only if they differ in some systematic way from the detected stars will they affect @xmath58 . since the brightest and reddest star was selected and since strong mass loss occurs only close to the tip of the rgb , the missed ( fainter ) stars may be less likely to have mass loss",
    ". a lower limit can be obtained by assuming that none of the missed stars has detectable mass loss . in that case for each cluster @xmath65 ( number of stars with dust excess)/(total number of stars ) ( cf .",
    "last line of table  2 ) .    in 47",
    "tuc and ngc  362 , where crowding does not severely affect statistics , @xmath6615% , while lower values have been inferred in m15 and ngc  6388 but in this cluster the very central core region was not sampled . in @xmath1",
    "cen 34 stars with dust excess should have been detected if @xmath6615% as in 47  tuc and ngc  362 , but taking into account that only @xmath29% of the brightest giants are sampled ( see sect .",
    "3 ) , the expected number of detections drops down to @xmath67 , fully consistent with the inferred zero value .",
    "the result of m54 is not statistical significant , since it is too distant ( see also sect .",
    "broad time limits can be placed on the episodic variations . at average rates between 10@xmath39 and 10@xmath52 @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "table  3 ) each major mass loss event should occur on time scales somewhat shorter than the evolutionary times ( 56 myr on the upper rgb ) and longer than the time it takes the outflowing gas to reach the radii where we observe the dust , i.e. , decades , whatever be the actual mass loss mechanism ( several bursting episodes with multiple shells or more continuous flows ) . in principle",
    "such a lower limit to the episodic variation timescale can be as short as an instantaneous event , possibly at much higher mass loss rates , but our observations do not allow to constrain timescales with such a temporal resolution .    the total mass lost is crudely @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the total time interval in which a star experiences mass loss ( either through many short - living episodes or a more continuous flowing ) .    in order to account for a total mass loss of about @xmath70 required by the models to explain the hb morphology , and by assuming an average @xmath71 , @xmath72 should be @xmath73 , well within the inferred limits and almost one order of magnitude smaller than the total evolutionary time on the upper rgb .    another interesting result seen from figs .  8",
    ",  9 is that there is not any clear dependence of mass loss on metallicity , although more data , in particular for the metal poor clusters , are needed to draw firm conclusions .",
    "again this result is not unexpected .",
    "the earlier h@xmath56 studies also suggested little metallicity dependence in mass loss rates and are consistent with @xmath74 .",
    "however our observed time scales are much longer than the day to day variation observed in h@xmath56 emission .",
    "both the time scale and @xmath61 could be consistent with rgb magnetic cycles .",
    "further , studies of horizontal branch morphology ( catelan & de freitas pacheco 1993 ; lee , demarque & zinn 1994 ) suggest at most a mild metallicity dependence on mass loss efficiency except possibly at the lowest metallicities . in a recent paper van loon ( 2000 ) analyzing the mass loss rates of a sample of obscured agb stars also finds very modest dependence on metallicity , but possibly for different reasons related to the pulsation activity ( e.g. van loon 2001 ) .",
    "the observed metallicity independence of mass loss coupled with the fact that mass loss for rgb stars can be far below the criterion for radiatively driven winds suggests that dust may not be related to the driving mechanism for rgb mass loss .",
    "dust can simply be a tracer of the out flowing gas and not responsible for the outflow .",
    "our isocam survey of the central region of six massive globular clusters provided mid - ir photometry for 78 sources with identified stellar counterparts .",
    "52 sources are associated with bright giants close to the rgb - tip . of these about 40%",
    "have strong mid - ir excess ascribed to the presence of dusty circumstellar envelopes . correcting for stars not detected because of the low spatial resolution of isocam ,",
    "dusty envelopes are inferred around about 15% of the brightest giants ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the inferred mass loss rates are in the range @xmath76 , assuming as reference values an outflow velocity of 14  @xmath77 and a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 200 at the metallicity of 47  tuc and for a stellar luminosity of 1000  @xmath78 .",
    "* the mass loss occurs very near the rgb - tip and is episodic .",
    "* the mass loss episodes must last longer than a few decades and less than a million years .",
    "* there is no indication for a strict metallicity dependence of the frequency of mass loss occurrence .",

    "rtr is partially supported by nasa ltsa grant nag 5 - 6403 and stsci grant go-8709 .",
