    "the two sources are well detected in the k - band ( isaac ) .",
    "both sources are clearly detected in all four irac channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath14 m ) .",
    "the first of theses sources , hudf - jd1 , appears to be positionally associated ( within 1 arcsec ) with an x - ray source . since no acceptable fit to its observed spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "could be found in terms of stellar synthesis models , mobasher _ et al .",

    "is estimated to be m@xmath26 m@xmath19 for an adopted salpeter initial mass function with minimum and maximum stellar masses of 0.1 and 100  , respectively .",
    "the strong balmer break displayed by hudf - jd2 requires that its sed be dominated by stars of spectral types a0 or later , _",
    "i.e. _  main - sequence stars with masses less than @xmath27 ( _ e.g. , _  allen 1973 ) .",
    "this fact unambiguously indicates a rather old age ( @xmath28300 myr ) for the stellar population of hudf - jd2 .",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) conclude that the stars were formed at z@xmath29 ( _ i.e. _  an age of the universe @xmath30 myr ) , and possibly as high as z@xmath3112 - 20 , so that most of the stars were in place when the universe was only @xmath32 myr old .",
    "moreover , their model fitting indicates that hudf - jd2 formed the bulk of its stars very rapidly , on time scales @xmath33 myr , and the subsequent evolution was essentially passive . a stringent upper limit to the starburst age",
    "is set by the photometric redshift @xmath34 of hudf - jd2 , which corresponds to a time when the universe was only 830 myr old . adopting this prior",
    ", the model fitting procedure indicates that the age of the stellar population in hudf - jd2 is likely to be bracketed between 350 and 650 myr .",
    "these ages correspond to redshifts of galaxy formation between 10 and 20 .",
    "the estimated reddening is quite modest , with @xmath35 at 95%confidence limit .",
    "the best - fit model sed also provides estimates of the overall metallicity of the galaxy , which is bracketed within the interval @xmath36 , _",
    "i.e. _  between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the following , we will use a fiducial value of @xmath39 , keeping in mind that this value may be uncertain by a factor of two .",
    "given the high redshift of hudf - jd2 and the short time scale over which its stellar population was formed , it is of interest to explore whether the radiation from this galaxy was able to reionize its surrounding intergalactic medium . in this letter",
    ", we estimate the output of ionizing radiation from hudf - jd2 over its past history . we will show that the lyman continuum flux radiated by this source in the early phases of its evolution may be enough to reionize its surrounding igm appreciably and , under favorable conditions , even ionize it completely . for consistency with mobasher _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2005 ) paper , we adopt @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "reionization is a process that depends on the uv output of galaxies integrated over the time interval when they are active uv sources . in this respect ,",
    "hudf - jd2 is a promising reionization source in that , according to the models , its integrated lyman continuum photon flux is about @xmath40 photons that had to ionize the neutral hydrogen gas within a comoving volume of about @xmath41 mpc@xmath42 , the exact volume depending on the specific redshift ( within the range @xmath43 ; see below ) at which h was fully ionized . for a comoving hydrogen density of @xmath44 atoms  mpc@xmath45 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "spergel _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) , it appears that the produced lyman continuum photons outnumber the h atoms by almost an order of magnitude and that , therefore , a complete reionization is a real possibility .",
    "however , a realistic treatment of this process should take into account the facts that only a fraction @xmath46 of the lyman continuum photons escape from the source , and that the ionized gas may recombine , and do so at a particularly high rate if the igm material is clumped , traditionally parametrized by the clumping factor , @xmath47 .",
    "these effects tend to reduce the overall efficiency of the ionization process .    here , we take advantage of the extensive set of model calculations made by sfp who considered a wide range of semi - analytical models to estimate the reionization of the igm .",
    "all cases studied by sfp were based on the implicit assumption of a  snapshot \" of a statistical assembly of cosmic sources , which possibly formed at different epochs and were efficient uv radiation emitters over different time intervals , but , _ on average _ , constituted a steady supply of ionizing photons over the chosen redshift interval .",
    "the situation studied here is quite different .",
    "hudf - jd2 is a single , powerful source for which both the birth time and subsequent evolution are constrained by the observed sed .",
    "therefore , we have to allow explicitly for its past evolution .",
    "although the physical quantity that determines the reionization is the total ( _ i.e. _  time integrated ) lyman continuum photon flux , for a convenient comparison with observations , sfp parametrize their models in terms of the ratio of the lyman - continuum photon flux to the uv flux at 1400 , @xmath48 , which by construction remains constant over the time reionization takes place . for the case of hudf - jd2 , it is convenient to consider the ratio of a _ time averaged _ lyman - continuum photon flux to the _ current _ uv flux at 1400 .",
    "first , we define the average lyman - continuum photon flux as :    @xmath49}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the instantaneous lyman - continuum photon flux of the galaxy , @xmath51 is the time of the galaxy birth , and @xmath52 is the time interval during which reionization takes place .",
    "we adopt @xmath53  myr , which coincides with the approximate duration of the starburst in hudf - jd2 as estimated by mobasher _",
    "et al._(2005 ) .",
    "we can relate the average lyman - continuum photon flux @xmath54 to the luminosity in the detectable uv by defining an effective ionization parameter :    @xmath55    figure 1 shows the ionization parameter as a function of age for a starburst lasting 100 myr , which is computed using starburst99 models ( leitherer _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) for different metallicities and adopting a salpeter initial mass function within the interval 1 and 100 m@xmath56 . for our range of metallicity , the value of @xmath57 at about 350 - 650  myrs ( _ i.e. _  the range within which the hudf - jd2 age is likely to lie ) is rather high . for our fiducial metallicity of @xmath58 and for an age of 500  myr",
    ", we find @xmath59  erg@xmath21 , _ i.e. _  4.8 times higher than the value for a 100,000k blackbody source , even though in the synthesis models no star ever attains such a high effective temperature .",
    "this is because the ionizing flux was very high at the early epochs , while the observed 1400   flux correponds to a later epoch when the starburst has weakened considerably .",
    "we note that since the ionization parameter depends rather strongly on the age and metallicity of the galaxy , @xmath60 may be uncertain by a factor of two .",
    "the results are nearly the same for any starburst duration shorter than 100  myr . in this context",
    ", we note that a relatively long starburst ( _ i.e. _  duration @xmath31100  myr ) is probably needed to account for the high metallicities implied by the best - fitting sed and that these , in turn , may require multiple episodes of nuclear reprocessing .    scaling the results of sfp model calculations for @xmath61 ( their table  1 , and appendix a ) , we have computed the constraints on source surface brightness for a case in which reionization starts at @xmath62 and is complete by @xmath63 ( _ i.e. _  about 500 and 400 myr , respectively , before the epoch corresponding to our observations ) with ionization efficiency @xmath59  erg@xmath21 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "in this diagram the scaling factor is simply the ratio of the @xmath60 value to the reference value of sfp for @xmath64k , @xmath65  erg@xmath21 .",
    "the one difference relative to sfp model calculations is that here the only contribution to the near uv flux is from stellar radiation because the nebular emission of the galaxy is negligible at the time it is observed .",
    "this simple scaling procedure can be employed to describe all cases involving individual sources with well defined evolutionary histories .    in our case",
    ", we find that with the observed magnitude at @xmath66 ( corresponding to rest - frame wavelength 1400 ) , @xmath67 , and an effective source density of @xmath68 arcmin@xmath69 ( _ i.e. _  one source within the nicmos field , @xmath70 ) , hudf - jd2 , as an isolated source , could have ionized the hydrogen gas within the volume encompassed within the solid angle subtended by the hudf - nicmos boundaries up to the redshift @xmath71 ( _ i.e. _  the _  cell of universe \" _ that we can associate to it ) only if the escape fraction of lyman - continuum photons is @xmath72 ( for c=1 ) or the clumping factor is @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this is already an impressive result because we are dealing with _",
    "one _ source , which , even with rather severe assumptions , such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , can be responsible for at least 20% of the ionization of its universe cell .    by taking an escape fraction less than unity",
    "we are implicitly including the effects of absorption of lyman continuum photons by both neutral hydrogen and dust grains within hudf - jd2 .",
    "however , in our calculations we also have to allow for dust extinction that may attenuate the source spectrum at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit .",
    "the best - fit to hudf - jd2 sed yields an estimate of a rather modest selective extinction @xmath77 ( mobasher _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) , which implies an upper limit to the extinction at rest frame 1400   of about @xmath78 magnitudes .",
    "this result is retatively independent of the adopted extinction law , be it the effective attenuation law for starburts galaxies ( _ e.g. , _  calzetti _ et al . _   1996 ,",
    "charlot & fall 2000 ) , or the recent measurements of the extinction law in a galaxy at @xmath79 ( mediavilla _ et al . _",
    "the extinction correction increases the source flux at rest frame 1400   by a factor of @xmath80 on average , thus moving the source to the right in figure 2 ( open triangle ) , indicating that for @xmath75 and @xmath76hudf - jd2 by itself could account for up to 25% of the total ionization of its surrounding igm .",
    "in addition , hudf - jd2 may not be an isolated source , but rather the brightest member of a population of galaxies within one and the same volume , whose other members are too faint to be detected in the available images . adopting a schechter luminosity function with a slope @xmath81 and a cutoff magnitude @xmath82 ( as appropriate for z=3 galaxies ; steidel _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) , with the condition that hudf - jd2 is the only source brighter than @xmath83 or @xmath84 , and assuming that the other members of the same group are identical in nature to hudf - jd2 except for being fainter , the total power turns out to be between 4.2 and 6.7 times higher than hudf - jd2 itself , depending on whether the lf extends just to @xmath85 or down to @xmath86 , respectively . as a consequence , the global effect for reionization would correspond to that of a source density @xmath87 higher , _",
    "i.e. _  0.86  arcmin@xmath69 ( open circle in figure 2 ) .",
    "if this is the case , then it follows that hudf - jd2 , together with its lower luminosity companions , could _ easily _ produce enough lyman - continuum radiation to reionize the igm in their neighborhood under most reasonable circumstances ( _ e.g. _ , escape fraction as low as 0.2 and clumping factor as high as 20 ) .",
    "correspondingly the electron scattering optical depth for our reference model , in which reionization starts at z@xmath88 and is complete at z@xmath89 , turns out to be @xmath90 .",
    "we have considered the possible effects the source hudf - jd2 on the reionization of the universe .",
    "we find that hudf - jd2 may indeed be capable of reionizing its portion of igm ( _ i.e. _  the gas within a volume defined by the subtended solid angle of the hudf - nicmos field and the redshift of complete reionization , z@xmath91 ) , possibly with the help of unseen fainter companions , starting the process at a redshift as high as z@xmath92 .",
    "regardless of whether hudf - jd2 is able to account for the _ entire _ reionization of its cell of universe , it is certain that it had the power to appreciably ionize it at high redshifts .",
    "even with no reddening correction and not allowing for faint companions , it appears that hudf - jd2 alone should be able to ionize either 20% of its cell if the matter distribution is homogeneous , or ionize it at an average 20% level ( _ i.e. _  the gas in the cell is 80% neutral ) if there are density inhomogeneities in different directions .",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) estimate that active star formation in hudf - jd2 lasted less than 100  myr , which implies a redshift interval of @xmath93 if the galaxy formed at @xmath94 and @xmath95 if the galaxy formed at @xmath96 , during which hudf - jd2 was ionizing its cell of the universe at a @xmath97% level , at least . more generally , if hudf - jd2 represents the  typical \" source present in _ any _ @xmath98 field on the sky , then this type of sources could readily ionize the igm at levels and redshifts as high as required to account for wmap findings ( @xmath99 at z@xmath100 ; spergel _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the four @xmath101-dropout sources detected and studied by eyles _",
    "et al . _   ( 2005 ) in the hst / acs goods images of the chandra deep field south , may indeed be representatives of the  second brightest \" galaxies in the ladder of the luminosity function .",
    "actually , their measured magnitudes are about 1.5 - 2 mag fainter than measured for hud - jd2 .",
    "all of these sources are found to have z@xmath102 , stellar masses @xmath103 , ages of @xmath104 myr and implied formation redshifts @xmath105 ( eyles _ et al . _   2005 ) .",
    "the presence of hud - jd2 together with these additional bright sources in the chandra deep field south ( by design one of them , namely smb03#1 , falls within the hudf area ) appears to lend support to the possibility that the reionization of the universe be dominated by massive galaxies that , rather unexpectedly , were able to form during the early evolution of the universe .",
    "although the presence of a cluster of galaxies and the assumptions about their properties are somewhat speculative , we would like to stress that these are _ predictions _ that will be possible to confirm or exclude once the james webb space telescope ( jwst ; _",
    "stiavelli _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) , currently due to be launched in mid-2013 , will come into operation . according to the model calculations by panagia _",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 , and in preparation ) , sources like hudf - jd2 and its analogs at higher redshifts will be easy to study spectroscopically because in their active star formation phases , they will have intrinsically high luminosities providing fluxes as high as 150  njy in the near and mid infrared .",
    "fluxes at these levels are expected to be detectable with the jwst - nirspec spectograph at resolution of @xmath106 with a s / n ratio of 10 in 10@xmath107 seconds exposures . with the advent of jwst",
    "it will be possible to fully characterize these early universe sources , thus clarifying once and for all the process of galaxy formation and the reionization of the universe .",
