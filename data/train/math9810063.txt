    "in some earlier papers we showed that typical non - self - adjoint schrdinger operators @xmath0 exhibit spectral instability in the following sense . for any @xmath1 there exist many @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that @xmath4 even though @xmath5 is not near the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour occurs for the harmonic oscillator with a nonreal coupling constant as well as for many non - self - adjoint anharmonic oscillators .",
    "there is a rapidly growing literature on pseudospectral theory , which was invented to explore just such possibilities , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we return to the same type of operator , but measure spectral instability by a method which provides more precise information about the instability of individual eigenvalues .",
    "we have computed the so - called instability indices of the first @xmath6 eigenvalues @xmath7 of the harmonic oscillator , and see that they appear to increase exponentially with @xmath8 .",
    "we have carried out a similar but more limited exercise for the resonances of a typical schrdinger operator with dilation analytic potential , and report our conclusions .",
    "our definition of the instability index of an isolated eigenvalue @xmath5 of @xmath0 of multiplicity @xmath9 involves the fact that the eigenfunction @xmath10 of @xmath0 associated with @xmath5 is different from the eigenfunction @xmath11 of @xmath12 associated with its eigenvalue @xmath13 . in section 2",
    "we show that the instability index @xmath14 of @xmath5 is equal to the norm of the spectral projection @xmath15 associated with @xmath5 , and also present a number of other theoretical properties of the index .    if @xmath16 acts in @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a complex - valued potential then @xmath19 and @xmath20 . hence for any isolated eigenvalue we have @xmath21 )",
    "is very small because the complex - valued eigenfunction @xmath10 is oscillating rapidly .",
    "because the spectral instability develops so rapidly as @xmath8 increases , we have had to take great care to use computational methods which are reliable .",
    "fortunately for our first problem there are independent methods of checking the values which we have obtained . in the second case",
    "we use the experience gained by the first problem , and have checked the reliability of the conclusions under the variation of several different parameters in the computational method . in section  6 we summarize the conclusions of our investigation .",
    "if @xmath5 is an isolated point of the spectrum of a closed operator @xmath22 in a hilbert space @xmath23 , the spectral projection @xmath15 associated with @xmath5 is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is any sufficiently small closed contour winding around @xmath5 .",
    "the assumption that this projection has rank @xmath9 is stronger than the assumption that @xmath5 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity @xmath9 .    if @xmath10 and @xmath26 are the normalised eigenvectors of @xmath22 and @xmath27 associated with the eigenvalues @xmath5 and @xmath28 respectively , and if @xmath15 has rank @xmath9 , then @xmath29 and the instability index of @xmath5 is equal to @xmath30 .",
    "we have @xmath31 since @xmath32 we see that @xmath29 .",
    "it is now easy to verify that @xmath15 is given by @xmath33 and hence that @xmath34    if @xmath15 has rank @xmath9 then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined to be the coefficient of @xmath37 in the expansion of the eigenvalue of the perturbed operator @xmath38 : @xmath39    by standard arguments in perturbation theory @xcite we have @xmath40 where the perturbed eigenvector is normalised by @xmath41 we deduce that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore @xmath44 and @xmath45 the proof is completed by the observation that @xmath46    the instability index is also related to the notion of pseudospectrum , which is a geometric way of looking at resolvent norm properties . namely if @xmath1 we put @xmath47 the sizes of these sets , which all contain the spectrum of @xmath22 , measure the spectral instability of @xmath22 .",
    "one always has @xmath48 but the rhs is often much larger than the lhs .",
    "the following theorem states that if @xmath49 is large then the component of @xmath50 containing @xmath5 is large in a related sense .",
    "several similar results can be obtained in the same manner .",
    "suppose that the spectral projection @xmath15 associated with the isolated eigenvalue @xmath5 of @xmath22 has rank @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a closed contour surrounding the connected component of @xmath50 which contains @xmath5 but does not intersect @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the length of @xmath25 .",
    "we have @xmath53",
    "let @xmath0 be the schrdinger operator @xmath54 acting in @xmath55 .",
    "let us first outline briefly the method for determining the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "for any @xmath56 there exist two solutions @xmath57 of @xmath58 which vanish as @xmath59 respectively .",
    "we introduce _ transfer functions _",
    "@xmath60 satisfying nonlinear first order differential equations to be given below and proper initial conditions at @xmath61 . we wish to solve the cauchy problem for @xmath62 for @xmath63 and for @xmath64 for @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are sufficiently large .",
    "provided we know initial conditions for @xmath70 at @xmath71 which correspond to @xmath72 vanishing at @xmath73 respectively , the two cauchy problems can be solved by a standard numerical method .",
    "the question how to transfer the so - called admissible boundary conditions from singular points ( which are @xmath61 in our case ) has been extensively studied by a. a. abramov and his collaborators ( a survey of their results can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , the behaviour of the potential @xmath18 has to be taken into account : say , if @xmath18 is bounded and vanishes rapidly at infinity then @xmath70 are asymptotically constant as @xmath74 , respectively . later on in this section we shall consider this and other cases applying the ideas of @xcite .    to locate the eigenvalues  in terms of the transfer functions we choose @xmath75 and",
    "consider @xmath76 this function is meromorphic on @xmath77 with zeros at the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "the zeros are independent of @xmath78 but @xmath79 may also have poles which depend on @xmath78 .",
    "they are at the eigenvalues of the restrictions of @xmath0 to @xmath80 and @xmath81 subject to dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath78 in both cases .    to determine the zeros of @xmath79 numerically we use the argument principle ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a contour integration procedure ) to obtain their approximate positions followed by some variant of newton s method to obtain accurate values .",
    "one has to be careful not to choose a value of @xmath78 for which there is a pole close to the zero of interest , so it is recommended that a few different values of @xmath78 are investigated .",
    "the numerical elaboration of the above ideas involves a substantial amount of preliminary work .",
    "one may find the approximate location of the eigenvalues and of the maxima of the eigenfunctions by an independent method .",
    "for example if one discretises a large enough interval in the real line then one can find approximate eigenvalues by a standard matrix eigenvalue routine ; matlab is ideal for this purpose .",
    "another possibility is to use jwkb asymptotic formulae which also enable one to find an interval @xmath82 outside which the relevant eigenfunction is negligible , and a point @xmath83 at which the modulus of the eigenfunction takes its maximum value ( see the next subsection in this regard ) .    if the potential @xmath18 is an even function with respect to reflection about the origin , then every eigenfunction is either even or odd , and the problem may be decomposed into two independent problems on @xmath84 , with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions at @xmath85 .",
    "this is the case in our examples .",
    "from now on in this subsection we concentrate on the symmetric problem and take advantage of symmetry .",
    "actual computational formulae are given below for the case of the half - line .",
    "note that the theory of admissible boundary conditions based upon asymptotic analysis of solutions of the differential equation at @xmath73 applies in a generic situation .",
    "auxiliary cauchy problems to be solved numerically are as follows .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is constant  this corresponds to the harmonic oscillator problem and its perturbations studied in the next section . for a fixed value of @xmath89 we consider the solution @xmath90 of ( [ evp ] ) vanishing as @xmath87 and introduce a new transfer function @xmath91 satisfying @xmath92 where @xmath93 is sufficiently large . according to @xcite , @xmath94 for such @xmath95 that @xmath96 exists .",
    "moreover , one can work out the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath91 for a particular potential @xmath97 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "say , we replace the condition at infinity by @xmath99 choosing @xmath93 so that the last term in the above formula is negligible . along the lines of the mentioned paper we pose the so - called admissible condition at infinity for the considered potential .",
    "the above initial condition is equivalent to the boundary condition @xmath100 at infinity , up to terms of order @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "next , we are going to consider the operator @xmath0 with a potential vanishing rapidly enough at infinity ( see section  5 ) .",
    "following the same approach , we introduce @xmath103 and for this function obtain the singular cauchy problem @xmath104    clearly , the initial conditions vary for different types of potential .",
    "still , for each particular choice of @xmath18 we are able to apply the developed theory and set appropriate initial conditions for transfer equations .",
    "after that has been done we integrate those equations numerically from @xmath93 from right to left to some ( fixed ) @xmath105 .",
    "the transfer functions @xmath91 , @xmath106 actually take their values in the riemann sphere , so we have to switch between them and their inverses at certain values of @xmath107 .",
    "as soon as @xmath108 or @xmath109 becomes greater than a prescribed constant we change to @xmath110 or @xmath111 , respectively and from this point on integrate analogous equations starting with proper initial conditions for the inverse functions .",
    "after a finite number of changes of this kind we reach the chosen point @xmath78 .    to complete the transfer procedure , consider the solution @xmath112 of ( [ evp ] ) satisfying @xmath113 .",
    "we denote @xmath114 and solve @xmath115 from left to right .",
    "( obvious changes should be made when considering an odd solution @xmath112 satisfying a dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath116 . )",
    "again , we switch from @xmath117 to @xmath118 if necessary and stop at the same point @xmath78 .",
    "remark that the described procedure is the simplest version of the boundary condition transfer , or pivotal condensation method we have chosen for the second order equation .",
    "there is an extensive literature ( cf .",
    "@xcite etc . ) on the transfer methods where much more advanced techniques are developed .",
    "although there are other possibilities , in this paper we get satisfactory results implementing the above version .    finally , we have @xmath117 ( corresponding to either odd or even @xmath112 ) and @xmath106 calculated at the same point @xmath78 . if @xmath119 then @xmath5 is an eigenvalue  of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we evaluate @xmath120 for certain values of @xmath89 as described and then find the eigenvalues  of interest as zeros of @xmath120 .",
    "as has already been mentioned , we first use the argument principle ( see @xcite for computational formulae ) to locate the eigenvalues  and then apply an iterative newton - like method to obtain more precise values . after an eigenvalue  has been located up to the required accuracy",
    ", one can compute the corresponding eigenfunction by recovering its values from the transfer functions @xmath106 , @xmath117 .",
    "the method proposed has been implemented as a universal fortran  77 code including all the basic procedures described above in this section .",
    "auxiliary cauchy problems have been solved by a standard routine based on the runge  kutta ",
    "merson fourth order method . in our computations",
    "we have used 32-bit and 64-bit arithmetic .",
    "the question remains how to choose @xmath78  although the zeros of @xmath120 do not depend on @xmath78 , in practical computations the choice of @xmath78 does play a significant role .",
    "in fact , we investigated different functions @xmath120 for a wide range of @xmath78 .",
    "one of the possible choices is @xmath121 . for problems with even potentials the zeros and the poles of @xmath120 interchange ( see figures  1a , 1b , 2a ) .",
    "we use contour map plots to find initial guesses for eigenvalues  when there is no other a - priori information about their location .",
    "plotting contour maps with the use of matlab  5.2 has also helped us to avoid poles when looking for zeros .",
    "thus , in a generic situation we recommend that one calculates the values of @xmath122 ( for which we have used our fortran code ) , then produces the plots ( matlab graphics ) and , finally , finds eigenvalues  accurately ( a standard iterative fortran procedure ) .",
    "we regard our numerical results obtained via the above method as reliable . in particular , this is confirmed by several values of @xmath78 providing entirely different functions @xmath122 whose zeros coincide .",
    "these results are to be reported below in the following two sections .",
    "the second stage in the process is to compute the instability index defined by ( [ index ] ) .",
    "the obvious method , namely calculating the two integrals after first determining the eigenfunction numerically , is highly inaccurate if the instability index is large .",
    "the reason is that the integrand in the denominator is highly oscillatory , and the evaluation of such integrals is problematical . the following method is much superior in applications . below",
    "we present a technique suitable for an arbitrary ( not necessarily symmetric ) potential .",
    "we introduce four functions as follows . for @xmath123 $ ]",
    "we define @xmath124 where @xmath10 is the eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue @xmath5 .",
    "similarly for @xmath125 $ ] we define @xmath126 it is obvious that @xmath127 which converges exponentially rapidly to @xmath128 as @xmath129 and @xmath130 . the task is to find a procedure to evaluate the four functions accurately .",
    "we consider only @xmath131 , the others being similar .",
    "it follows from its definition that @xmath132 and that @xmath131 satisfies the differential equation @xmath133 this may be solved numerically , say , by a runge - kutta method to determine @xmath134 .",
    "it is important to be sure that the solutions of ( [ hminus ] ) and the other three equations are stable .",
    "it suffices to note that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which implies the stability of the solutions @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 from right to left and from left to right , respectively .",
    "this has been confirmed by numerical tests .",
    "the same is true for the transfer equations quoted in the previous subsection  the solution @xmath91 , for instance , is known to be stable from right to left which is essential for practical computations .",
    "there is a potential problem in that if @xmath141 for some @xmath142 then @xmath131 is usually infinite at that point .",
    "generically one does not expect a complex - valued @xmath143 function of a real variable to vanish anywhere , and we have not seen this problem arise , but one needs to discuss how the method should be adapted in the event of its occurrence .",
    "there are two cases , which are distinguished numerically by whether @xmath144 as @xmath145 or @xmath146 as @xmath145 .",
    "note that since @xmath10 is a non - zero solution of ( [ evp ] ) and @xmath141 it follows that @xmath147 , so @xmath148 as @xmath145 .    if @xmath141 and @xmath149 then @xmath144 as @xmath145 and @xmath150 as @xmath145 .",
    "neglecting lower order terms we have @xmath151 as @xmath145 .",
    "the results follow .",
    "thus , in this case we are still able to integrate the same equation ( [ hminus ] ) ; the point @xmath152 is , in fact , regular rather than singular .",
    "the more standard case is that in which @xmath141 and @xmath153 .",
    "clearly @xmath146 as @xmath145 .",
    "if we put @xmath154 then @xmath155 and @xmath156 as @xmath145 and @xmath157 for all @xmath107 near @xmath152 .    neglecting lower order terms we have @xmath158 as @xmath145",
    "the verification that @xmath159 satisfies the differential equation ( [ htilde ] ) is routine .",
    "thus , in the considered case we recommend to change to @xmath160 at @xmath161 and integrate ( [ htilde ] ) instead of ( [ hminus ] ) .",
    "naturally , the stability of the procedure proposed in this subsection depends heavily on @xmath78 ( though the exact value of @xmath128 does not depend on the norm of @xmath10 ) .",
    "a proper choice of @xmath78 is very important and can essentially influence the results . choosing @xmath162 and",
    "@xmath163 themselves  instead , we integrate several auxiliary odes .",
    "secondly , this procedure is numerically stable . in the cases which we have examined the solutions @xmath164 , @xmath165 change quite slowly and smoothly .",
    "if the instability index of an eigenvalue is very large then it is clear from theorem 2 that the eigenvalue is intrinsically difficult to compute .",
    "one mechanism by which this can occur in computations is that at the eigenvalues , for which one knows that @xmath166 , one also finds that @xmath167 is very small , so it is not possible to locate @xmath5 accurately .",
    "the following theorem provides a link in one direction between these two phenomena at a theoretical level .",
    "we assume that @xmath168 on @xmath55 , where @xmath97 vanishes rapidly enough as @xmath169 . given @xmath75 and @xmath170 satisfying @xmath171 , let @xmath172 be the solution of @xmath173 on @xmath174 subject to @xmath175 as @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath176 be the solution of the same equation on @xmath177 $ ] subject to @xmath178 as @xmath179 .",
    "we put @xmath180 as usual so that @xmath166 if and only if @xmath5 is an eigenvalue  of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the instability index at an eigenvalue @xmath5 , let @xmath10 be the associated eigenfunction and assume that @xmath181 is bounded on @xmath182 .",
    "then @xmath183    if @xmath1 is small enough there exists @xmath184 such that @xmath185 .",
    "now put @xmath186 for the appropriate values of @xmath107 , so that @xmath187 we have @xmath188 under the following conditions on @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath190 then @xmath191 while if @xmath192 we must have @xmath193 therefore @xmath194 but @xmath195 uniformly as @xmath196 by the assumptions of this section , so @xmath197 the statement of the theorem now follows from the formula for the instability index given in theorem 2 .    in the two examples considered below , @xmath198 is very small for large values of @xmath199 , so it is impossible to determine its zeros .",
    "this seems to be the main barrier to the determination of large eigenvalues .",
    "consider the operator @xmath0 defined by ( [ sch ] ) with the potential @xmath98 , referred to as @xmath200 in the rest of the paper .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for @xmath200 is called the _ harmonic oscillator _ problem and is known to have infinitely many eigenvalues  @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath203{c}\\,x)$ ] where @xmath204 are normalising constants , @xmath205 denote hermite polynomials , @xmath206 .",
    "these eigenfunctions are either even or odd : @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 .",
    "as proposed in section  3 , we consider @xmath200 on the half - line adding either neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions at the origin .",
    "we have used it as a sample problem to check the above method for finding eigenvalues  and eigenfunctions .",
    "indeed , the results thus obtained are in very good accordance with the theory ; they confirm the reliability of the method .",
    "it allowed us to calculate @xmath210 eigenvalues  of @xmath200 up to the accuracy @xmath211 .    when implementing the method of section  3 we found that the accurate numerical determination of the eigenvalue  @xmath7 for @xmath212 is not possible using double precision ( 64-bit ) arithmetic , particularly because @xmath198 can be very small near the points where @xmath213 .",
    "we computed the instability indices for the first 100 eigenvalues , using the jwkb approximation to the eigenfunction @xmath214 associated with the eigenvalue  @xmath215 as described in @xcite .",
    "this approximation suggests that @xmath216 takes its maximum near @xmath217 and @xmath218 where the real constants @xmath219 and @xmath220 are computed from @xmath221 having an appropriate value of @xmath219 is , of course , helpful when we calculate @xmath222 by means of the method given in subsection 3.2 .",
    "let us present some results concerned a perturbation of the harmonic oscillator operator @xmath223 we have investigated various perturbations of the form @xmath224 for a range of fairly small @xmath225 .",
    "the reason is that looking for the perturbation providing the most unstable results , one has to choose @xmath226 as follows . from the perturbation theory formula cited in the proof of theorem  1 one can easily see that among perturbations satisfying @xmath227 the function @xmath228 provides the worst perturbation of the @xmath8-th eigenvalue  of @xmath200 .",
    "indeed we then have @xmath229    if we only take account of the first term of the jwkb expansion for @xmath214 , we obtain the perturbing potential @xmath230 after removing an irrelevant phase factor . the expectation that @xmath231 provides a perturbation of the eigenvalue  almost as great as that due to @xmath232",
    "is tested below .",
    "we tabulate below the absolute values of the corrections to several eigenvalues  @xmath7 of @xmath233 calculated numerically by means of the method described in section  3 .",
    "tables  13 contain the values of @xmath234 for @xmath235 and @xmath224 .",

    "the instability index of an eigenvalue of a non - self - adjoint ordinary differential operator was defined in section 2 , where we investigated its theoretical properties .",
    "we have described a known general numerical procedure for computing the eigenvalues of the differential operator and have introduced a new and numerically stable procedure for computing the instability indices .    in order to test this procedure ,",
    "we have carried out extensive computations for the harmonic oscillator with a complex coefficient .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath7 of this operator are given by an exact formula , and we found close agreement between the formula and our numerical results for @xmath238 .",
    "we have also computed the instability index by two independent methods , the first being the general procedure mentioned above .",
    "the second uses a special numerical technique only available for the harmonic operator , but capable of yielding extreme accuracy if implemented in maple with high precision arithmetic .",
    "the instability indices of the first @xmath239 eigenvalues obtained by the two methods were found to be in close agreement ; see table  4 .",
    "the discrepancies between the two methods are partly explained by the very high values of the instability indices of the eigenvalues @xmath7 for @xmath240 .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed for the harmonic oscillator in @xcite where we approached the phenomenon via pseudospectral theory .",
    "our current approach has the advantage that it provides a quantitative measure of the instability of individual eigenvalues under small perturbations of the potential .",
    "we have carried out numerical experiments and confirmed that the size of the effects predicted matches what we have observed for a particular perturbation . in section  4",
    "we have conjectured on the basis of the numerical results that the eigenfunctions of the complex harmonic oscillator do not form a conditional basis .",
    "we have also investigated the complex resonances of a typical self - adjoint operator by means of the standard technique of dilation analyticity .",
    "this identifies the resonances of the original operator with eigenvalues of any one of a family of associated non - self - adjoint operators indexed by an angle .",
    "the eigenvalues of these operators are independent of the angle , but the instability indices depend upon its value .    we have discovered that for a certain operator , as is seen from table  10 , the first @xmath241 eigenvalues have very small imaginary parts , which is explained by the fact that there exists a ( non - convergent ) asymptotic expansion which has real coefficients of all orders . for higher eigenvalues",
    "the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues increase rapidly in absolute value .",
    "we have computed the instability indices of these eigenvalues for typical angles and discovered that they increased rapidly with the modulus of the eigenvalue , reaching a maximum value near the region where the imaginary part starts to increase ( see tables  9.19.3 ,  10 ) .",
    "no theoretical explanation of this phenomenon exists .",
    "the very large size of the instability indices in both examples indicates that the computation of large eigenvalues of non - self - adjoint differential operators is likely to be intrinsically intractable in many other cases of a similar type .",
    "the same applies to the computation of large resonances of self - adjoint differential operators .",
    "the effect of rounding errors or of small perturbations of the operator may be to change the computed eigenvalues drastically .",
    "this discovery casts some doubt on the significance of theoretical investigations of the asymptotic distributions of resonances or of any computations of such eigenvalues for all except self - adjoint operators . our experience , and that of others who work within the pseudospectral approach , has been that the extreme instability of large eigenvalues is the norm rather than a possibility which occurs only in pathological cases .    0.5 in * acknowledgments * the authors are grateful to prof .",
