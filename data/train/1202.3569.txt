    "graphene has continued to surprise scientists since its discovery in 2004 by geim and his team @xcite . theoretically , the carrier transport properties are fantastic . especially , its high carrier mobility of 44000@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "but attempts to utilize these astonishing properties in graphene devices are posing some difficulties .",
    "the limitation is probably due to several factors including ; lack of band gap in graphene sheets , edge defects , disorder , among others . to overcome some of these obstacles , particularly the lack of band gap",
    ", the dimension of graphene sheet has to be reduced .",
    "after all , new physics ( quantization ) emerge when dimensions of materials are reduced .",
    "an infinite 2d graphene could become a one dimensional plus quantization along one other direction , the consequence is the opening of a gap in the its dispersion spectrum . the resulting material from the 2d infinite sheet form a graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) . depending on the nature of the ribbon edges ,",
    "one gets two symmetry groups ; armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agnr ) and zigzag graphene nanoribbon ( zgnr ) .",
    "electron dynamics of both agnr and zgnr have different properties , mostly due to the berry phase and pseudo spin @xcite .",
    "edge states have significant contribution to graphene properties , because in a nanometer size ribbon , massless dirac fermions can reach the edges within a femto - second before encountering any other lattice effects , like electron - electron interaction , electron - phonon interaction , etc .    in this paper , we study the phenomenon of negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) in gnrs . in conventional semiconductor devices",
    ", a negative differential conductive behavior is known to offer great potential for high frequency applications as bloch oscillators , frequency multipliers , and fast switching devices .",
    "for this reason , the ndc effect has been greatly explored and discussed in several graphene nanostructures , particularly in @xcite .",
    "ndc can also be observed in other graphene allotropes ; carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) @xcite . the unique energy spectrum of holes and electrons in gnrs , especially its narrow gapless nature leads to nontrivial features such as negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) in the thz regime @xcite .",
    "in fact , we must emphasize that the phenomenon of ndc and bloch oscillations in a material is a possible signature for thz generations in the material @xcite , since ndc occurs in the thz spectral range .",
    "most of the methods of producing thz frequencies are experimental and only very few analytical ( without computer numerics ) approaches are known . though green function techniques have also been employed in some cases .",
    "motivated by the fact that a rigorous analytical approach is necessary for studying ndc in gnrs , we adopt a semi - classical method used in references @xcite for armchair and zigzag cnts .",
    "we predict that gnrs should also reproduce similar results as in reference @xcite because both cnts and gnrs have almost the same full tight binding ( tb ) nonlinear complex band structure .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows ; in ssection [ sec : the - theory ] , we derived the current density of agnr and zgnr and imposed certain conditions to reduce the equations to forms appropriate for our models .",
    "the results obtained in section [ sec : results ] are plotted and discussed in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "the paper finally concludes in section [ sec : conclusion ] where some recommendations for future applications are made .",
    "as it is usually done in semi - classical treatment of quantum systems , we assume that the dynamics of the free @xmath1-electrons in graphene satisfies the time - dependent boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) in zero magnetic field",

    "the whole of the region @xmath132 gives what is called negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) .",
    "a consequence of ndc in gnrs is a formation of electric field domains that impedes a continuous motion of electric field waves and thus blocks high frequency generation in these nanoribbons .",

    "now , it is not clear what these crests and throughs represents , they might be associated with field domains along one direction ( for @xmath141 ) and others along the opposite direction ( for @xmath142 ) and vice - versa .",
    "we have demonstrated that graphene nanoribbons exhibit ndc regions in its @xmath131 characteristics at low bias field when @xmath102 .",
    "ndc is observed either in the presence of bias field alone or by superimposing ac field amplitudes on the bias field .",
    "for one ac field , ndc occurs around @xmath143 .",
    "when two ac fields at commensurate frequencies are applied , high - harmonic ndc emerge for both even and odd harmonics at rather very low frequencies @xmath144 .",
    "the even - series gives pronounced high - harmonic ndc than the odd - series .",
    "the presence of high - harmonic ndc means that it is possible for high - frequency generation in graphene nanoribbons when electric field domains are suppressed at high enough applied frequencies @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
