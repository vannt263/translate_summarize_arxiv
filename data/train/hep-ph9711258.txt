    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will provide an unprecedented range of energies and luminosities that will hopefully probe the quark - gluon plasma and chiral phase transitions .",
    "the basic picture of the ion - ion collisions in the energy ranges probed by these accelerators as seen in the center - of - mass frame ( c.m . ) , is that of two highly lorentz - contracted ` pancakes ' colliding and leaving a ` hot ' region at mid - rapidity with a high multiplicity of secondaries@xcite . at rhic for @xmath7",
    "central collisions with typical luminosity of @xmath8 and c.m .",
    "energy @xmath9 , a multiplicity of 500 - 1500 particles per unit rapidity in the central rapidity region is expected@xcite . at lhc for head on @xmath10 collisions with luminosity @xmath11 at c.m .",
    "energy @xmath12 , the multiplicity of charged secondaries will be in the range @xmath13 per unit rapidity in the central region@xcite . at rhic and lhc typical estimates@xcite of energy densities and temperatures near the central rapidity region are @xmath14 .    since the lattice estimates@xcite of the transition temperatures in qcd , both for the qgp and chiral phase transitions are @xmath15 , after the collision",
    "the central region will be at a temperature @xmath16 . in the usual dynamical scenario that one @xcite envisages ,",
    "the initial state cools off via hydrodynamic expansion through the phase transition down to a freeze - out temperature , estimated to be @xmath17@xcite , at which the mean free - path of the hadrons is comparable to the size of the expanding system .",
    "the initial state after the collision is strongly out of equilibrium and there are very few quantitative models to study its subsequent evolution .",
    "there are perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena that contribute to the processes of thermalization and hadronization .",
    "the perturbative ( hard and semihard ) aspects are studied via parton cascade models which assume that at large energies the nuclei can be resolved into their partonic constituents and the dynamical evolution can therefore be tracked by following the parton distribution functions through the perturbative parton - parton interactions @xcite .",
    "parton cascade models ( including screening corrections to the qcd parton - parton cross sections ) predict that thermalization occurs on time scales @xmath18@xcite .",
    "after thermalization , and provided that the mean - free path is much shorter than the typical interparticle separation , further evolution of the plasma can be described with boost - invariant relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the details of the dynamical evolution _ between _ the parton cascade through hadronization , and eventual description via hydrodynamics is far from clear but will require a non - perturbative treatment .",
    "the non - perturbative aspects of particle production and hadronization typically envisage a flux - tube of strong color - electric fields , in which the field energy leads to production of @xmath19 pairs@xcite .",
    "recently the phenomenon of pair production from strong electric fields in boost - invariant coordinates was studied via non - perturbative methods that address the non - equilibrium aspects and allow a comparison with hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "the dynamics _ near _ the phase transition is even less understood and involves physics beyond the realm of perturbative methods .",
    "for instance , considerable interest has been sparked recently by the possibility that disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc s ) could form during the evolution of the qcd plasma through the chiral phase transition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "rajagopal and wilczek@xcite have argued that if the chiral phase transition occurs strongly out of equilibrium , spinodal instabilities@xcite could lead to the formation and relaxation of large pion domains .",
    "this phenomenon could provide a striking experimental signature of the chiral phase transition and could provide an explanation for the centauro and anti - centauro ( jacee ) cosmic ray events@xcite .",
    "an experimental program is underway at fermilab to search for candidate events@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of the dynamics of the chiral phase transition and the possibility of formation of dcc s have focused on initial states that are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte)@xcite-@xcite . we propose to study the _ non - equilibrium _ aspects of the dynamical evolution of highly excited initial states by relaxing the assumption of initial lte ( as would be appropriate for the initial conditions in a heavy - ion collision ) .",
    "consider , for example , a situation where the relevant quantum field theory is prepared in an initial state with a particle distribution sharply peaked in momentum space around @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath20 is a particular momentum .",
    "this configuration would be envisaged to describe two ` pancakes ' or ` walls ' of quanta moving in opposite directions with momentum @xmath22 . in the target frame",
    "this field configuration would be seen as a ` wall ' of quanta moving towards the target and hence the name ` tsunami'@xcite .",
    "such an initial state is out of equilibrium and under time evolution with the proper interacting hamiltonian , non - linear effects should result in a redistribution of particles , as well as particle production and relaxation .",
    "the evolution of this strongly out of equilibrium initial state would be relevant for understanding phenomena such as formation and relaxation of chiral condensates .",
    "starting from such a state and following the complete evolution of the system thereon , is clearly a formidable problem even within the framework of an effective field theory such as the linear @xmath23-model .    in this article",
    "we consider an even more simplistic initial condition , where the occupation number of particles is sharply localized in a thin spherical _ shell _ in momentum space around a momemtum @xmath0 , i.e. a _ spherically symmetric _ version of the ` tsunami ' configuration .",
    "the reason for the simplification is purely technical since spherical symmetry can be used to reduce the number of equations .",
    "although this is a simplification of the idealized problem , it will be seen below that the features of the dynamics contain the essential ingredients to help us gain some understanding of more realistic situations .",
    "we consider a weakly coupled @xmath24 theory ( @xmath25 ) with the fields in the vector representation of the @xmath26 group . anticipating non - perturbative physics",
    ", we study the dynamics consistently in the leading order in the @xmath27 expansion which will allow an analytic treatment as well as a numerical analysis of the dynamics .    the pion wall scenario described above",
    "is realized by considering an initial state described by a gaussian wave functional with a large number of particles at @xmath22 and a high density is achieved by taking the number of particles per correlation volume to be very large . as in finite temperature field theory , a resummation along the lines of the braaten and pisarski @xcite program",
    "must be implemented to take into account the non - perturbative aspects of the physics in the dense medium . as will be explicitly shown below , the large @xmath28 limit in the case under consideration",
    "provides a resummation scheme akin to the hard thermal loop program @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of this spherically symmetric `` tsunami '' configuration described above reveals many remarkable features : i ) in a theory where the symmetry is spontaneously broken in the absence of a medium , when the initial state is the @xmath26 symmetric , high densty , `` tsunami '' configuration , we find that there exists a critical density of particles depending on the effective ( htl - resummed ) coupling beyond which spinodal instabilities are induced leading to a _",
    "dynamical _ symmetry breaking .",
    "ii ) when these instabilities occur , there is profuse production of low - momentum pions ( goldstone bosons ) accompanied by a dramatic re - arrangement of the particle distribution towards low momenta .",
    "this distribution is non - thermal and its asymptotic behavior signals the onset of bose condensation of pions .",
    "iii ) the final equation of state of the `` pion gas '' asymptotically at long times is ultrarelativistic despite the non - equilibrium distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the model under consideration and describe the non - perturbative framework , namely the large @xmath28 approximation .",
    "section iii is devoted to the construction of the wave functional and a detailed description of the initial conditions for the problem .",
    "the dynamical aspects are covered in section iv .",
    "we first outline some issues dealing with renormalization and then provide a qualitative understanding of the time evolution using wave functional arguments .",
    "we argue that the system could undergo dynamical symmetry breakdown and provide analytic estimates for the onset of instabilities .",
    "we present the results of our numerical calculations in section v which confirm the robust features of the analytic estimates for a range of parameters . in section",
    "vi we analyze the details of symmetry breaking and argue that the long time dynamics can be interpreted as the onset of formation of a bose condensate even when the order parameter vanishes",
    ".    finally in section vii we present our conclusions and future avenues of study .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we consider a @xmath24 theory with @xmath26 symmetry in the large-@xmath28 limit with the lagrangian ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is an @xmath26 vector , @xmath31 and @xmath32 represents the @xmath33 pions , @xmath34 .",
    "we then shift @xmath23 by its expectation value in the non - equilibrium state    @xmath35    we refer the interested reader to several articles which discuss the implementation of the large @xmath28 limit ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath27 series may be generated by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath36 which is an _ algebraic _ function of @xmath37 , and then performing the functional integral over @xmath36 using the saddle point approximation in the large @xmath28 limit@xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the leading order terms in the expansion can be easily obtained by the following hartree factorisation of the quantum fields@xcite ,    @xmath38    all expectation values are to be computed in the non - equilibrium state . in the leading order large @xmath28",

    "in particular it is an excellent tool for studying the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions such as high temperature or high density@xcite .",
    "one way to obtain the non - equilibrium equations of motion is through the schwinger - keldysh closed time path formalism .",
    "this is the usual feynman path integral defined on a complex time contour which allows the computation of in - in expectation values as opposed to in - out s - matrix elements .",
    "for details see the references@xcite . the lagrangian density in this formalism is given by    @xmath40-{\\cal l}[\\vec{\\phi}^-]\\;,\\ ] ]    with the fields @xmath41 defined along the forward @xmath42 and backward @xmath43 time branches .",
    "the non - equilibrium equations of motion are then obtained by requiring the expectation value of the quantum fluctuations in the non - equilibrium state to vanish i.e. from the tadpole equations@xcite ,    @xmath44    in the leading order approximation of the large @xmath28 limit , the lagrangian for the @xmath45 field is quadratic plus linear and the tadpole equation for the @xmath45 leads to the equation of motion for the order parameter or the zero mode    @xmath46\\phi(t)+ m_b^2\\phi(t)=0\\;. \\label{eqnmotion}\\ ] ]    in this leading approximation the non - equilibrium action for the @xmath33 pions is ,    @xmath47=\\int d^3xdt\\left\\ { ( -\\frac{1}{2}{\\vec{\\pi}^+ }   \\cdot\\partial^2{\\vec{\\pi}^+}-{\\cal{m}}_\\pi^{+2}(t)\\vec{\\pi}^+\\cdot\\vec{\\pi}^+ ) -(+\\longrightarrow-)\\right\\}\\;. \\label{pionlag}\\ ] ]    we have not written the action for the @xmath45 field fluctuations because they decouple from the dynamics of the pions in the leading order in the large @xmath28 limit@xcite .    having introduced the model and the non - perturbative approximation scheme the next step is to construct an appropriate non - equilibrium initial state or density matrix .",
    "although one could continue the analysis of the dynamics using the schwinger - keldysh method , we will study the dynamics in the schrdinger representation in terms of wave - functionals because this will display the nature of the quantum states more clearly .",
    "we find it convenient to work with the fourier - transformed fields defined as ,    @xmath48    where we have chosen to quantize in a box of finite volume @xmath49 that will be taken to infinity at the end of our calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian for the pions is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the effective time dependent frequency and @xmath52 is given by eq.([massoft ] ) .",
    "to leading order in the large @xmath28 limit the theory becomes gaussian and the non - linearities are encoded in a self - consistency condition , since the frequency ( [ omegadef ] ) depends on @xmath53 and this expectation value is in the time dependent state , as displayed by the set of equations ( [ massoft]-[expi2 ] ) .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our ultimate goal is to model and study the non - equilibrium aspects of the evolution of an initial , highly excited state that relaxes following high energy , heavy - ion collisions .",
    "an idealized description of the associated physics would be to consider two wave packets made up of very high energy components representing the heavy ions and moving with a highly relativistic momentum toward each other .",
    "the goal would be to follow the dynamical evolution of the wavefunctionals corresponding to this situation , thus clearly elucidating the non - equilibrium features involved in the phase transition processes following the interactions of the wave packets .",
    "this initial state could be described by a distribution of particles , sharply peaked around some special values @xmath54 and @xmath55 in momentum space .",
    "the evolution of this state then follows from the functional schrdinger equation .",
    "even with the simplification of a scalar field theory such a program is very ambitious and beyond the present numerical capabilities .",
    "one of the major difficulties is that selecting one particular momentum breaks rotational invariance and the evolution equations depend on the direction of wave vectors even in the gaussian approximation .",
    "( this statement will become clear below ) .    in this article however , we choose to study a much simpler description of the initial state which is characterized by a high density particle distribution in a thin spherical ` shell ' in momentum space .",
    "we propose an initial particle distribution that has support concentrated at @xmath56 .",
    "this particular state does not provide the necessary geometry for a heavy ion collision , however it does describe a situation in which initially there is a large multiplicity of particles in a small momentum ` shell ' , there is no special beam - axis and the pions are distributed equally in all directions _ with a sharp spatial momentum_. this is a rotation invariant state that describes a highly out of equilibrium situation and that will relax during its time evolution ( a spherical `` tsunami '' ) .      since in the leading order approximation in the large @xmath28 expansion",
    "the theory has become gaussian ( at the expense of a self - consistency condition ) , we choose a gaussian ansatz for the wave - functional at @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this choice is that upon time evolution this wave functional will remain gaussian and will be identified with a squeezed state functional of pions .",

    "( [ hamilt ] ) which is essentially a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian with self - consistent , time - dependent frequencies .",
    "the functional schrdinger equation is given by    @xmath59    the last term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) which is independent of the fields ( a time dependent ` vacuum energy term ' ) can be absorbed in an overall time dependent phase of the wave functional .",

    "such an analysis has been performed elsewhere @xcite . in summary",

    "recall , however , that the initial distribution is _ not _ thermal . in a scalar theory ,",

    "this will in turn cause the time dependent frequency in the hamiltonian , @xmath143 to _ increase _ with time since the frequency and the fluctuations are directly related via the self - consistency condition .",
    "the resulting dynamics is then expected to approach an oscillatory regime in which the width of the wavefunctional and the frequency of the harmonic oscillator are of the same order . under these circumstances",

    "the first feature to note is that @xmath169 and @xmath126 appear together in such a way that the effective coupling is now @xmath170 and hence the physics is intrinsically non - perturbative when @xmath171 .",

    "this estimate yields the band of wave - vectors    @xmath179    which will become spinodally unstable .",
    "the mode functions for these wavevectors will grow exponentially at early times and their contribution to the fluctuation @xmath152 ( [ dimless ] ) will grow  this is a back - reaction mechanism that will tend to shut - off the instabilities .",

    "we now provide an alternative argument to clarify the physical mechanism for the dynamical symmetry breaking .",

    "the initial distribution restores the symmetry at @xmath187 much in the same way as in finite temperature field theory at temperatures larger than the critical temperature .",

    "thus we obtain a physical picture of the different cases : in _ case i _ the symmetry was unbroken _ without _ a medium and remains unbroken when the large density of particles is added .",
    "by contrast in _ case ii _ , the symmetry is spontaneously _ broken _ in the absence of a medium , the high density initial state restores the symmetry in a state out of equilibrium . under time",
    "evolution the dynamics then redistributes the particles producing spinodal instabilities and breaking the symmetry .",
    "we reiterate that the second case represents a novel situation which is in a sense , contrary to what happens at high temperature where thermal fluctuations suppress the possibility of long - wavelength instabilities .",
    "the issue of symmetry breaking is a subtle one here .",
    "if we begin with symmetric initial conditions , @xmath180 , the wavefunctional will always be symmetric since the evolution will maintain this symmetry . in order to test whether the symmetry is spontaneously broken or not , one must provide an initial state that is slightly asymmetric , with a very small initial expectation value @xmath190 , and",
    "follow the subsequent time evolution .",
    "if the expectation value oscillates around zero , then the symmetry is _ not _ spontaneously broken since the minimum of the ` dynamical effective potential ' is at the origin in field space .",
    "if the expectation value begins rolling away from zero and reaches a stationary value away from zero then one can assert that there is a dynamical minimum away from the origin and the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "thus the test of symmetry breaking requires an initial condition with a small value of the order parameter .",
    "the asymptotic value of the order parameter can be obtained by analyzing the full dynamics of the theory and depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no static effective potential description of the physics .",
    "however , some information about the asymptotic state ( when @xmath191 ) can be obtained from the equation of motion ( [ zeromodeeq ] ) by setting @xmath192 which yields the sum rule @xcite @xmath193 provided @xmath194 .",

    "the long - wavelength modes begin to grow because of spinodal instabilities but their contributions are suppressed by phase space .",
    "only when their amplitudes become non - perturbatively large , is the particle production at long - wavelengths an effective contribution to the total particle number .",
    "when this happens , there is an explosive burst of particle production following which the total number of particles remains fairly constant throughout the evolution . after the spinodal instabilities are shut - off , which for the values chosen for the numerical evolution correspond to @xmath215 , the dynamics becomes non - linear .",
    "whereas during the initial stages the dynamics is in the linear regime , after backreaction effects have shut - off the spinodal instabilities the further evolution of the distribution functions is a consequence of the non - linearities .",
    "fig.([ordpara ] ) exhibits one of the clear signals of symmetry breaking .",
    "the order parameter begins very near the origin , but once the spinodal instabilities kick in , the origin becomes a maximum and the order parameter begins to roll away from it .",
    "notice that the order parameter reaches a very large value , which is the dynamical turning point of the trajectory , before settling towards a non - zero value .",
    "we find that the value of the turning point and the final value of the order parameter depend on the initial conditions .",
    "to illustrate the non - perturbative growth of modes clearly , we have plotted the quantity @xmath216 in fig .",
    "( [ modulo ] ) which shows how the amplitude of the long wavelength modes becomes non - perturbatively large and of order @xmath208 .",
    "we have also carried out the numerical evolution with @xmath217 and @xmath218 with the same value of @xmath123 and found the same quantitative behavior , proving that the relevant combination is @xmath170 as revealed by the analytic estimates above .",
    "we have also confirmed that for @xmath219 there are no spinodal instabilities and the dynamics is purely oscillatory without a redistribution of the particles and with no appreciable particle production . when the peak of the initial distribution function is _ beyond _ the spinodally unstable band @xmath220 ( see eq.([spinoband ] ) ) , the original distribution is depleted and broadened somewhat with irregularities and wiggles but remains qualitatively unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ zoomed ] ) .",
    "however , when the peak of the initial distribution is _ within _ the spinodally unstable band there is a complete re - distribution of particles towards low momentum .",
    "the original distribution disappears under time evolution and after the spinodal time only the low momentum modes are populated .",
    "we have seen both from the numerical evolution and from the argument based on the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) which is a result of the ward identities and goldstone s theorem , that the effective mass term vanishes asymptotically .",
    "therefore the asymptotic equation of motion for the mode functions is that of a massless free field .",
    "in particular the asymptotic solution for the @xmath212 mode is given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 are complex coefficients that can only be obtained from the full time evolution .",
    "however because the wronskian @xmath224 is constant in time , neither @xmath222 nor @xmath223 can vanish @xcite .",
    "this situation must be contrasted with that for the @xmath225 modes whose asymptotic behavior is of the form @xmath226 this causes the number of particles at _ zero momentum _ to grow asymptotically as @xmath227 whereas the number saturates for the @xmath225 modes .",
    "the three dimensional phase space conspires to cancel the contribution from the @xmath212 mode to the _ total _ number of particles , energy and pressure , which , from the numerical evolution ( see fig.(4 ) ) are seen to remain constant at long times .",
    "this situation is very similar to that in bose - einstein condensation where the excess number of particles at a fixed temperature goes into the condensate , while the total number of particles outside the condensate is fixed by the temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath212 mode will become macroscopically occupied when @xmath228 where @xmath49 is the volume of the system ( i.e. the number of particles in the zero momentum mode becomes of the order of the spatial volume ) .",
    "when this happens this mode must be isolated and studied separately from the @xmath229 modes because its contribution to the momentum integral will be cancelled by the small phase space at small momentum .",
    "again the situation is very similar to the case of the usual bose - einstein condensation .",
    "notice that this argument is independent of a non - vanishing order parameter @xmath230 and leads to the identification of the zero momentum mode as a bose condensate that signals spontaneous symmetry breaking even when the order parameter remains zero .",
    "since the effective mass is zero we identify the condensing quanta as pions and therefore this mechanism is a novel form of pion condensation in the absence of direct scattering .",
    "when scattering is included , beyond the leading order in the large @xmath28 approximation , the formation of the bose condensate will require a detailed understanding of the different time scales .",
    "the time scale for the collisionless process described above must be compared to the time scale for collisional processes that would tend to deplete the condensate .",
    "if spinodal instabilities causing non - perturbative particle production at low momentum occur on much shorter time scales than collisional redistribution then we would expect that there will be a non - perturbatively large population at low momenta that could be interpreted as a coherent condensate .",
    "the spinodal instabilities seen in this article are similar to those which lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates@xcite .",
    "however we emphasize that unlike most of the previously studied scenarios for dcc formation in which a ` quench ' into the spinodal region was introduced _",
    "ad - hoc _ , in the present situation the spinodal instabilities are of _ dynamical origin_. we have studied a situation where the vacuum theory has symmetry breaking minima ( with @xmath231 in eq .",
    "( [ barebroken ] ) ) but the initial state is highly excited with the particle density larger than a critical value leading to a symmetry restored theory in the medium .",
    "however this initial state is strongly out of equilibrium and its dynamical evolution automatically induces spinodal instabilities .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    "the goal of our study is to understand the dynamical evolution of strongly out of equilibrium states . in the usual investigations of the dynamics of the quark gluon plasma",
    "one uses a hydrodynamic description in which the energy density , pressure and all the thermodynamic variables depend only on proper time@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are then a consequence of the conservation laws which are appended with an equation of state to determine the evolution completely .",
    "the hydrodynamic regime corresponds to the case when the collisional mean free path is shorter than the wavelength of the hydrodynamic collective modes , and therefore the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium is warranted .",
    "a valid question in the situation that we have studied in this aricle , is whether and when an equation of state is a meaningful concept .",
    "in the leading order in the large @xmath28 expansion there are no collisional processes ( these arise at @xmath232 ) and therefore the concept of a hydrodynamic regime in is not applicable in principle .",
    "furthermore since the state considered is spatially homogeneous the pressure will depend on time rather than on proper time .",
    "since the energy is conserved and the pressure evolves with time , an equation of state will have a meaning only when the evolution has reached the asymptotic regime .",
    "the energy density is given by @xmath233    the last term which arises in a consistent large @xmath28 expansion , is extremely important in that after renormalization it provides a _ negative _ contribution which can interpreted as part of the effective potential@xcite .",
    "using the equation of motion for the order parameter and the mode functions it is straightforward to show that the energy is conserved and the last term is necessary to ensure energy conservation . since the energy is conserved it can be renormalized by a subtraction at @xmath234 , and therefore is finite in terms of the renormalized quantities .",
    "the pressure is given by the following expression , @xmath235.\\label{ppluse}\\ ] ]    unlike the energy density , the pressure is not a constant of the motion and needs proper subtractions to render it finite .",
    "the detailed expressions for both the renormalized energy and pressure can be found in references @xcite .",
    "however , rather than computing the total energy density and pressure , we will study the contributions from the modes that are highly populated and whose amplitudes become non - perturbatively large ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "asymptotically , when the effective mass vanishes and the low momentum modes become highly populated with amplitudes of @xmath237 the renormalized energy density is given by ( see ref.@xcite for the explicit expression of the renormalized energy density )    @xmath238 + { \\cal o}(g ) \\label{enerdensasym}\\ ] ]    where @xmath239 is the largest spinodally unstable wave vector at early times and @xmath240 represents terms that are perturbatively small .",

    "clearly , the trace vanishes asymptotically .    during the early stages of the dynamics",
    "when spinodal instabilities arise and develop with profuse particle production , an equation of state can not be defined .",
    "the dynamics can not be described in terms of hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "since the processes under consideration are collisionless , there is no local thermodynamic equilibrium and an equation of state is ill - defined .",
    "we have studied the evolution of an @xmath26-symmetric quantum field theory , prepared in a strongly out - of - equilibrium initial state .",
    "the initial state was characterized by a particle distribution localized in a thin spherical shell peaked about a non - zero momentum , a spherical `` tsunami '' .",
    "the formulation of this scenario resulted from a simplification of the idealized ` colliding - pancake ' description of a heavy - ion collision . for a large density of particles in the initial state ,",
    "the ensuing dynamics is non - perturbative and consequently we studied the @xmath26 theory in the leading order in the large @xmath28 limit which is a systematic non - perturbative approximation scheme .",
    "when the tree - level theory has vacua that spontaneously break the symmetry and the number of particles within a correlation volume at @xmath57 is so high that the symmetry is restored initially , spinodal instabilities are then induced _ dynamically _ resulting in profuse particle production for low momenta .    this situation is to be contrasted with the usual studies of dcc s where the initial state is assumed to satisfy lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) and the spinodal instabilities are introduced either via an _ ad - hoc _ quench or via cooling due to hydrodynamic expansion which is also introduced phenomenologically .",
    "backreaction of the long wavelength fluctuations eventually shuts off these instabilities and the nonlinearities redistribute particles towards low momenta .",
    "we thus find asymptotically in time a novel form of pion condensation at low momentum , out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , a macroscopic condensate of the bose - einstein type will form at much longer times ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "when the spinodal instabilities shut off we find that the asymptotic ` quasiparticles ' are massless pions with a non - thermal , non - perturbative distribution function peaked at low momentum but with an ultrarelativistic equation of state .",
    "we believe that these phenomena point out to very novel and non - perturbative mechanisms for particle production and relaxation that are collisionless , strongly out of local thermodynamic equilibrium and can not be described in the early stages via a coarse - grained hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "these are the result of strongly out of equilibrium initial states of high density that could potentially be of importance in the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at high luminosity accelerators .",
    "a more realistic treatment , modelling a collision will require an initial state which breaks the rotational invariance and selects out a beam - axis along which the colliding pions move in opposite directions . however , the analysis of such initial conditions is beyond the present numerical capabilities and will be deferred to a future work .",
    "an upshot of this study of high density , non - equilibrium particle distributions is the following tantalizing theoretical question : can one extract a resummation scheme , or an effective theory akin to the hard thermal loop effective expansion for arbitrary _ non - equilibrium , non - thermal _ distributions such as the `` tsunami '' configuration for _ gauge theories _ ?",
    "possible answers and consequences of such initial states for gauge theories will be discussed in a forthcoming article @xcite .",
