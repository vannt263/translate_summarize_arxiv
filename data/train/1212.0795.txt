    "gene duplication is a major source of genomic expansion and is believed to underlie the evolution of complex biological functions @xcite .",
    "functions encoded by two copies of the same gene are redundant making the loss of function of a duplicate by mutation a likely outcome @xcite .",
    "hence , the observed abundance of duplicates in plant and animal genomes makes the retention of duplicate genes a much studied problem .",
    "the loss of selection pressure on the duplicate can be viewed not as a prerequisite for its elimination , but as an opportunity for it to become more abundant by acquiring a new and fitness - enhancing function @xcite , a process called neofunctionalization .",
    "if the duplicated gene already had multiple roles ( is pleiotropic ) , their partitioning among the duplicates would make each essential , a model called subfunctionalization @xcite .",
    "appeals to variations amongst duplicate genes can , in diploid species , also be applied to allelic variations in singleton genes @xcite .",
    "the loss of one or both allelic function has been the basis of debates on whether dominance in mendelian inheritance is an evolutionary or physiological phenomenon @xcite . dominance and gene duplication",
    "have both been framed @xcite as phenomena that involve gene dosage  the contribution of the number of functional genes to phenotype  and the functional redundancy and fitness of genes may involve quantitative factors .",
    "quantitative considerations include the disruption of stoichiometrically balanced protein levels when gene duplication increases the expression of one interacting partner@xcite .",
    "it is the network of interactions that mediate the causal pathways from genes to phenotype and consequent evolutionary outcomes .",
    "novelties in evolution often emerge via changes to an organism s development .",
    "a common mechanism in developmental trajectories is the transformation of transient stimuli into steady - state expression levels @xcite by gene regulatory circuits that implement positive feedback , wherein a gene upregulates its own expression .",
    "such an autoregulatory gene activator formed the basis of an experimental study @xcite on the `` reversal of subfunctionalization '' in the pathway that governs brain - stem development . while different developmental triggers activate the paralogous _ hoxa1 , hoxb1 _ gene pair in modern mice , they were replaced by a single autoregulatory activator responsive to a common set of with _ cis_-regulatory sites _",
    "cis_-regulatory inputs , and the resulting organism was viable @xcite .",
    "it is this circuit of a self - regulating activator , the smallest unit of positive feedback , that is the object of our study .",
    "we study the consequences of duplication of this gene , both at the level of phenotype and in potential evolutionary outcomes , upon mutation . when mutations appear in this circuit as per the subfuntionalization model , introducing complementary loss of function _",
    "cis_-regulatory mutations that confers tissue - specific expression patterns @xcite , we find the emergence of a property of some developmental trajectories , namely redundancy of duplicates helps overcome mutational loss @xcite .",
    "the mutation of a gene expressed in a tissue is compensated for by the upregulation of its unexpressed partner in this model , called transcriptional backup @xcite .",
    "mutations affecting the activating sites of the transcription factor give rise to the onset of oscillations , both stable and bursty .",
    "since the mathematical model for oscillations is also applicable to a diploid genotype with two alleles differing at their activating site , we examine the evolutionary fate of the duplicated gene haplotype in a diploid species via the fitness @xcite of the oscillatory phenotype .",
    "fitness values are indexed by parameter values in the doubled activator circuit that give rise to distinct qualitative dynamics .",
    "the dynamical system we study is that of a diploid model of the transcriptional network @xcite , which enables us to consider both the interactions between diverging duplicates as well as allelic interactions @xcite , particularly those between allelic variants or heterozygotes .",
    "heterozygous advantage has been identified as a property that facilitates the fixation of a duplicate gene in a population @xcite , a finding of relevance to our results below .",
    "heterozygosity is also commonly associated with hybrid vigour ; indeed , this correlation has also been extended to dosage ( im-)balance of copy number variations and alterations to the amplitude of circadian rhythms @xcite . unlike circadian clock models @xcite , which contain a negative feedback link @xcite in circuit topology , our duplicated activator network does not introduce negative feedback explicitly .",
    "instead , negative feedback arises due to a competitive mechanism whereby one activator excludes the binding of another to the promoter .",
    "although the mechanism implementing negative feedback  and thus oscillations  is different , our model displays a dependence of amplitude on hetrozygosity and dosage balance found to be correlated to hybrid vigour @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of paralogous genes in oscillatory processes has been noted in the literature @xcite , also as a means to maintain oscillations upon loss of single genes @xcite .",
    "although our model makes no explicit reference to the systems that contain the genes reported there , our theoretical finding suggests an evolutionary mechanism for the proliferation of duplicate genes that take part in oscillatory dynamics as heterozygotes .",
    "there are two stages of modelling that we perform in this paper .",
    "the key first step is to frame the onset of qualitative changes to the dynamics of transcription regulation as a consequence of gene duplication in the language of dynamical systems .",
    "the second step is to model the likely evolutionary fate of a mutant haplotype containing such a duplicate .",
    "for the first step , we set up a model of transcriptional regulation of a genotype characterised by a duplicated positive feedback loop , with the transcription rates derived from the probability of promoter occupancy by rna polymerase @xcite in the presence of the activators .",
    "an extension of the model to include the effects of intrinsic noise  stochasticity in transcription  is presented , to address how single cell and population averaged phenotype might differ . to enable the second stage of analysis on the evolutionary fates , a population genetic model for the likely invasion of a duplicated gene",
    "is then introduced , with selection coefficients that depend on parameters of the transcriptional network .",
    "thereafter , we present results on the behaviour of these models .",
    "we identify qualitative shifts in the dynamics owing to alterations in parameter values  in _ cis _ and in _ trans _  to be presented separately .",
    "after a discussion of the results owing to _ cis_-regulatory changes that affect switching behaviour , we address the case of changes that affect regulation by _",
    "trans_-acting effects .",
    "it is this set of changes that we shall track in the second stage of modelling , that of the evolutionary fate of the duplicated gene .",
    "a final section summarises the different components discussed within the regulatory model , linking the qualitative aspects of model behaviour to different experimental studies .",
    "a positive feedback loop provides a mechanism to convert transient input signals into stable output levels , acting as a switch .",
    "developmental stages , characterised by stable expression levels of subsets of genes , rely on regulatory circuits that implement positive feedback switches @xcite . the smallest circuit implementing positive feedback",
    "is one with a single autoregulatory gene ( see figure [ fig : grep ] ) ; for it to act as a switch , it is necessary for the activation reaction of a transcription factor binding to the gene promoter to have a cooperativity index , or hill coefficient , of 2 or more @xcite . as a specific instantiation of such cooperativity",
    ", we require that the autoregulatory gene at the top of the hierarchy activates itself after dimerisation of its protein product ( as shown in figure [ fig : grep ] ) , giving rise to a hill coefficient of 2 , although nothing in the model requires such a specific reaction .",
    "in particular , we disregard consideration of heterodimeric or homodimeric association , and assume the existence of homodimers alone .",
    "as will be clear from the analysis below , a greater degree of cooperativity facilitates many more qualitative changes to the dynamics , which we shall disregard in the interest of parsimony .",
    "our model takes such an autoregulatory gene coupled to target genes , which makes up a topology of the  terminal selector \" network type @xcite , and duplicates it ( see figure [ fig : duplinet ] ) .",
    "when duplicating the gene , we shall assume that both coding and regulatory regions of the gene are duplicated ; thus , we end up with the network on the right hand side of figure [ fig : duplinet ] .",
    "other influences on the activator might define developmental context or tissue specificity .",
    "such interactions operationally outline the loci of context dependent changes that we shall introduce , and are indicated by the arrows labelled @xmath0 into the activators @xmath1 in figure [ fig : duplinet ] .",
    "+      the  thermodynamic \" approach to modelling transcription is to set the rate of transcript formation to be proportional to the occupancy of the promoter of the gene to be expressed from a single allelic locus @xcite .",
    "promoter occupancy is facilitated by transcription factors that bind to cognate dna sequences and recruit the transcription machinery ",
    "rna pol ii , mediator complex forming multi - component proteins , _",
    "etc_. the probability of occupancy is accounted for by assigning boltzmann factors for the possible configurations of protein - dna bound states @xcite .",

    "the contribution of these configurations to the promoter occupancy is modelled in detail in appendix a. here we provide the resulting expression for the probability @xmath2 of occupancy of the promoter of a gene @xmath3 .",
    "this can be introduced in terms of the function @xmath4 of the transcription factors @xmath5 ( represented in vector notation @xmath6 ) @xmath7 which measures the amount of transcript produced in the presence of the @xmath8 relative to the basal rate of transcription @xmath9 , when transcription factors are absent , a quantity called fold - change .",

    "in particular , in order to to present verbal arguments that rely on mutations that disrupt pleiotropic properties and restrict them to context - specific roles ( as in the subfunctionalization model of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) the helper protein index @xmath0 will serve as a placeholder for such context - specific factors .",

    "this dynamically stable state of the duplicated autoregulator is rendered evolutionary stable by the divergence of the pleiotropic roles taken on by the duplicates , which are split and stabilised by the model of subfunctionalization @xcite .",

    "moreover , while there were two scenarios explored in the dynamics of regulation  a switch - like or an oscillatory phenotype  we shall only explore the evolutionary consequences of oscillatory dynamics and its role in the spread of the duplicate gene in this paper .",
    "recall , the fitness coefficients in ( [ tab : tablefitness ] ) are organised to explore the consequences of increased fitness arising from unequal activation strengths of the two alleles of a self - activating gene upon the potential for retaining gene duplicates . in the singleton case , homozygotes @xmath226 or @xmath227 ( note : @xmath83 and @xmath228 are the same allele ) have @xmath229 and @xmath230 , and hence the phenotype is non - oscillating .",
