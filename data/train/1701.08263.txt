    "relativistic hydrodynamics is a topic of very active theoretical and phenomenological development @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , it seems to provide a good description of physics in heavy ion collisions , making numerical hydrodynamic solvers an indispensable tool in this field .",
    "one hydrodynamic phenomenon that has received comparatively little attention is vorticity .",
    "this is understandable because it is not immediately straight - forward to link it to flow observables to vorticity .",
    "the direct observation of polarization of @xmath0 particles in heavy ion collisions @xcite has the potential to change this .",
    "a reliable set of tools to analyze this observable theoretically is however still lacking .",
    "polarization , vorticity and chirality observables have received some amount of attention in literature in the context of vorticity - induced polarization @xcite , hadronic reactions @xcite and generic transport theory including chirality @xcite , the latter motivated by the hypothesis of the chiral magnetic effect @xcite and its hydrodynamic @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic @xcite incarnation .",
    "an effective theory for describing the relationship between vorticity and polarization is however still missing .",
    "the problem is that vorticity does not emerge in the transport limit , but rather close to the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic regime .",
    "thermodynamics was studied within the usual techniques , updated with the inclusion of angular momentum @xcite , but this is not generally a good approximation for a strongly coupled dynamical system , where equilibrium is local rather than global .",
    "@xcite used thermodynamic equilibrium within an isochronous cooper - frye formula assuming polarization is zero before freezeout , but this assumption violates detailed balance across the freezeout hypersurface @xcite .",
    "if hadrons after freeze - out carry both vorticity and spin polarization , then so must the constituents of a fluid before freezeout .",
    "such a fluid , however , while being studied in condensed matter systems @xcite still needs to be developed for the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "even intuitively , the idea that only quasi - particles carry polarization makes envisioning such a fluid confusing .",
    "the problem is a conceptual one : local _ isotropy _ , one definition of an ideal fluid , _ forbids _ the transfer of angular momentum to spin as that would create an anisotropy independent of the coarse - graining scale @xcite ( such anisotropy , in normal hydrodynamics , is directly proportional to the mean free path ) .",
    "however , local _ equilibration _ and entropy maximization in the presence of angular momentum and spin explicitly necessitates of such an anisotropy @xcite . and , of course , vorticity conservation , the noether current of the diffeomorphism invariance underlying perfect fluid dynamics @xcite , should be broken if angular momentum can be transferred to local polarization .    to clarify this situation",
    ", one can turn to either the foundations of transport @xcite or strongly coupled ads / cft @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "polarization is always suppressed by factors of @xmath1 since gauge boson polarization is not gauge - invariant . in the former ,",
    "it is clear that a polarized fluid breaks molecular chaos since it introduces a two - particle correlation proportional to net - polarization .",
    "it is therefore not entirely describable by the first term in the bbgky hierarchy . to summarize this argument , as is well known hydrodynamics",
    "is based on a hierarchy of three length scales @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the separation of the microscopic degrees of freedom ( whose effect are non dissipative but probabilistic @xcite ) , @xmath4 is the mean free path ( whose effect is deterministic but dissipative ) , and @xmath5 is the gradient of the velocity .",
    "the second inequality controls leading - order dissipative phenomena , such as viscosity , conductivity and sound attenuation .",
    "it is generally thought to be limited by quantities such as the kss bound @xcite .",
    "it is clear that polarization corrections come from the first inequality , generally neglected in boltzmann and planar limit theories but most likely not irrelevant for fluids in small systems ( @xmath6 degrees of freedom with three colors in the gauge theory ) .",
    "the theoretical tools necessary to develop hydrodynamics in this limit @xcite , and to relate it to dissipation @xcite are well known : one writes down hydrodynamics in lagrangian form , and treats the microscopic scale as an effective planck constant @xcite , the knudsen number as an effective theory scale hierarchy and develops fluctuation - driven terms within the effective field theory .",
    "a perfect fluid without polarization can be described by three fields , describing the three lagrangian coordinate systems @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that it is a fluid can be imposed through a volume - preserving diffeomorphism invariance @xcite @xmath8=1\\ ] ] it therefore follows that the lagrangian is of the form ( notation of @xcite ) @xmath9}{\\phantom{a},\\phantom{a}}b_{ij}=\\partial_\\mu \\phi_i \\partial^\\mu \\phi_j\\ ] ] the lagrangian above can be shown in a straight - forward way to yield the energy momentum tensor whose conservation yields euler s equations @xcite , @xmath10 if one substitutes , for a chemical potential @xmath11 , representing a scalar conserved charge one gets @xcite @xmath12 note that the lagrangian @xmath13 coincides with the energy for vanishing chemical potential and corresponds , in general , to a legendre - transformed energy .",
    "the chemical potential is also related to the noether current generating the scalar conserved charge , a @xmath14 symmetry , by @xmath15 ) \\rightarrow l (   \\exp[i(\\psi + c ) ] ) { \\phantom{a},\\phantom{a}}\\mu = u_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\psi\\ ] ] the flow velocity @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 , which in four dimensions leads uniquely to a 4-vector normalized to unity @xmath18 with the comoving projector being @xmath19 since the four - velocity defined in  ( [ uphidef ] ) is by construction the direction of a local conserved four - current , @xmath20 it is natural to identify it with the entropy current , since entropy is the only locally conserved current in a fluid with no conserved charges .",
    "the relativistic extension of the kelvin circulation theorem , usually referred to as vorticity conservation , arises in this description as a non - local noether current of the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory , specifically @xcite @xmath21 @xmath22 that is the circulation of the three - velocity ( times a function ) along the flux tubes has components in the internal indices space , the lagrange coordinates , and not the space coordinates themselves . ]",
    "defined by the loop @xmath23 .",
    "the lhs of the equation is one definition of vorticity , and the rhs is the noether current @xmath24 for a , infinitesimal volume preserving diffeomorphism with generator fulfills @xmath25 as it has to for being a generator of volume preserving diffeomorphisms . ]",
    "@xmath26 which moves coordinates among the loop between the parameter values @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the system has intrinsic polarization , a net spin direction where a fraction of microscopic degrees of freedom point to , the coordinates @xmath29 are not enough because they do not contain information about polarization .    to find the appropriate additional degrees of freedom , we need to understand how to generalize hydrodynamics in a situation where some of what are considered fundamental principles of it , such as local isotropy , are inappropriate .",
    "the principles we choose to use are    ( i ) : :    the dynamics within each cell is faster than macroscopic dynamics , and    it is expressible only in term of local variables and with no explicit    reference to four - velocity @xmath16 ( gradients of flow are    however permissible , in fact required to describe local vorticity ) . (",
    "ii ) : :    this dynamics is dictated by local entropy maximization , within each    cell , subject to constraints of that cell alone . in the ideal limit ,    macroscopic quantities are assumed to be in local equilibrium inside    each macroscopic cell ( even if gradients are not vanishing and the    system can be relatively far away from global equilibrium ) .",
    "( iii ) : :    the only excitations allowed around a hydrostatic medium are sound    waves and vortices    we shall examine the consequences of each assumption in detail throughout the paper .",
    "this is not different from previous case of a fluid without polarization .",
    "the ordinary treatment of ideal hydrodynamics neglects polarization effects , which may not be negligible if one wants to measure particle polarization .",
    "it is necessary therefore to introduce some new degrees of freedom which are related to angular momentum and keep track of the microscopic polarization of a fluid .",
    "we can start with the general definition of the angular momentum current@xmath30.\\ ] ] the intrinsic angular momentum of a fluid cell is the integral around a small hypervolume @xmath31 of the flux of angular momentum    @xmath32    according to principle ( i ) , the integral is performed in the local comoving frame @xmath33 . since angular momentum can be exchanged ( in macroscopic time scales ) between cells , this is not a conserved quantity . in order to have a polarization which is not infinitesimally small , we normalize to the small volume of the coarse graining @xmath34    @xmath35    in this way",
    "the variable @xmath36 can be considered the local `` angular momentum '' of the fluid cell , which is usually neglected in a coarse graining procedure . as a mathematical simplification ,",
    "during the remainder of this work we will assume that only the part of @xmath36 orthogonal to the four velocity will be the relevant one to be included in the effective lagrangian treatment .",
    "this is the part related to the classical part of the angular momentum ( the one which ends up in the generator of rotations , as opposed to the time - like one which is related to the boost generator ) , note how in ref .",
    "@xcite this is the part which is actually responsible of particle polarization in global equilibrium and the weak coupling limit . we will call this variable @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the projector on the hyperplan orthogonal to the local four - velocity @xmath16 .",
    "according to point ( ii ) the fluid cells are supposed to be in local equilibrium .",
    "it is known that in the case of thermodynamical equilibrium , angular momentum is proportional to the antisymmetric part of the four - velocity gradients  @xcite @xmath40 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [    a_\\mu u_\\nu - a_\\nu u_\\mu \\right ] + \\omega_{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] being @xmath41 the four - acceleration and @xmath42 the vorticity ( the space part of the antisymmetric part of the gradient ) .",
    "note that this definition of vorticity , which we will use for the rest of the paper , is different from the one used in the relativistic extension of the kelvin theorem .",
    "equilibrium , local or global , implies that the space part of polarization has to be in a one to one correspondence to the vorticity subject to entropy maximization . more specifically ,",
    "if sound waves and vortices are the only excitations within the hydrostatic limit this means polarization and vorticity have to point in the same direction , therefore    @xmath43    this is a very general point : if we allow polarization and vorticity at equilibrium to be aligned by an angle @xmath44 , it would generate a broken continuous symmetry ( the longitudinal angle @xmath45 where the polar @xmath46 is defined by vorticity , could take any value ) , with eq .",
    "[ prevortspin ] updated to @xmath47 and @xmath48 is , in the comoving frame , a rotation matrix .",
    "this carries with it a goldstone mode ( excitation in @xmath45 ) with non - trivial topological structures ( rings in @xmath45 have to be continuos ) .",
    "a detailed investigation of this model is left for another work , though we suspect that dissipative corrections , where polarization relaxes to vorticity , make the ideal limit of such a system un - realizable . beyond the ideal fluid limit , as discussed in @xcite , an israel - stewart approach will be likely where @xmath49 _ relaxes _ to the vorticity tensor .",
    "we note that @xmath49 is an auxiliary field interacting with @xmath50 rather than an extension of @xmath50 to internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this reflects the fact that spin is not conserved separately to angular momentum .",
    "in noether s language , diffeomorphisms such as eq .",
    "[ diffeoinv ] act on @xmath50 but not @xmath51 , since the latter represents an internal symmetry .",
    "however , if we combine a lagrangian invariant under eq .",
    "[ diffeoinv ] with a locally invariant term for the internal rotation diffeomorphisms , a conserved current comprising space and internal symmetries , physically represented by a current combining spin current and vorticity - carried angular momentum , would arise .",
    "this can be seen more explicitly by considering that eq .",
    "[ zetadef ] only moves around @xmath50 and not @xmath51 breaks the symmetry .",
    "for instance , consider an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 stands for the dependency of the lagrangian density on a scalar combination of @xmath54 , its derivatives , and eventual mixed terms with the gradients @xmath55 which respects all the previous symmetries .",
    "hence , the conserved current corresponding to the loop @xmath56 reads    @xmath57    the term proportional to @xmath58 will give one term which is again a circulation of a function times @xmath59 , but the additional terms will add , in general , a circulation of an object which is not proportional to the velocity , preventing a further extension of the circulation theorem .",
    "for instance , looking in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] one can find one instance of the derivatives of the effective lagrangian , and it is straightforward to check that in this case there is a , rather complex , source term for the circulation of @xmath59 . in the end",
    "this means that the conserved current for the volume preserving diffeomorphisms can not be related to a familiar concept like the relativistic version of the circulation theorem .    in order to proceed",
    "one has to insert the new polarization degrees of freedom in the effecting lagrangian .",
    "the combination has to be a scalar and , as a first attempt , we assume that only the lowest order in gradients will be needed . hence , by counting gradients and enforcing symmetries , the lowest order scalar term is @xmath60 .",
    "for example @xmath61 $ ] is a higher term in gradients , since @xmath37 itself is proportional to a gradient of a macroscopic quantity by definition , @xmath62 would violate parity and @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "parity violating terms would of course be permitted in the context of anomalous hydrodynamics , but we will not consider it in the present work . in order to handle more easily the resulting equations we make use now of some phenomenological ansatz , which can be however easily relaxed if one wants to study the more general case . considering that polarization introduces a correlation between microstates ,",
    "the presence of polarization at a given entropy @xmath65 should change the free energy , to leading order in gradient , as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a dimensionful constant representing polarizability ( it can be positive for a ferromagnetic material and negative for an antiferromagnetic one ) . for dimensional reasons , and because of eq [ scales ]",
    ", @xmath68 given this , a physically reasonable way to introduce polarization is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a short - hand notation for @xmath64 .    in principle one should know the exact form of the effective lagrangian in order to solve the equations of motion .",
    "however only a few ( constant ) parameters are necessary for the study of the small perturbations over a static background ( linearized theory ) .",
    "the next chapter will be dedicated to that .",
    "we will end this section explaining the possible ways to fix ( without phenomenological assumptions like the last one ) the form @xmath71 , linking the lagrangian formulation and usual thermodynamics using the methods of @xcite but with the angular momentum in lieu of chemical potential ( note that the collinearity between angular momentum and polarization is what makes this analogy possible ) .",
    "one has to be extremely careful with this because , as illustrated for example in @xcite , entropy in systems with angular momentum is generally strongly non - extensive .",
    "one can however still define local equilibrium at the level of a cell , with the non - extensivity appearing as corrections depending on the microscopic scale ( eq . [ scales ] ) .    by analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite where it was said about the effective lagrangian density @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ fbmu ] ) `` it can be thought as a somewhat unusual thermodynamic potential where : @xmath73 '' .",
    "we can expect that the lagrangian density in eq .",
    "( [ rescaledf ] ) would correspond to thermodynamic potential @xmath74 in order to recognize the derivatives of this thermodynamic potential , one should do like in ref .  @xcite .",
    "namely compute the stress - energy tensor , consider @xmath75 , since there is no other conserved vector current except the entropy density , and check which one is the form of @xmath71 that will reproduce the thermodynamical relations obtained from another source ( for instance lattice gauge results for the equation of state of qcd ) .    in hydrodynamics without polarization , for instance ,",
    "the analogous of eq .",
    "( [ gd2 ] ) gives rise to the gibbs - duhem relation relating pressure and energy density to temperature and entropy density . here",
    ", because of the presence of angular momentum , terms like pressure and energy - density will not have such a simple relationship to actual energy and momentum flow within the fluid .",
    "unfortunately it is not known the exact form of the entropy density for a spinning system , mainly because of the difficulty of computing the logarithm of the partition function for a generic relativistic - quantum system . in ref .",
    "@xcite in any case there we can see that , in the weak coupling limit and for small vorticity , the angular momentum of a spinning system is proportional to the vorticity itself as in  ( [ prevortspin ] ) , an we can guess that    @xmath76    being @xmath77 the local temperature .",
    "a very interesting approach that could be extended to the case of a spinning fluid for the computation of the logarithm of the partition function is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case of coupling to an electro - magnetic field . in this case",
    "the system at equilibrium is not homogeneous ( lack of invariance by rotation for non vanishing em fields ) , and in particular vorticity is not vanishing ( note however that the four - velocity is defined in the cited paper as a killing vector field , not in the canonical landau or eckart frame , but it s consistent with the definition from the lagrangian coordinates ) .",
    "however there the case of vorticity in the absence of an external field has not been taken into account .",
    "most probably the effective theory for spinning fluids examined here , and the eft expansion developed in @xcite should be mixed for studying the full , non - linearized case .",
    "the most common way to study the evolution of a fluid is to extract from the lagrangian the stress energy tensor @xmath78 , and close the system of equations using the equation of state and local four - momentum conservation . from the lagrangian a generic lagrangian density",
    "an energy - momentum tensor can be constructed  @xcite . however , a crucial difference between polarized and unpolarized hydrodynamics is that in the former , due to lack of isotropy , conservation of energy - momentum does not close the equations of motion .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom in @xmath37 .    from the lagrangian , we can of course match the number of unknowns and equations , but at the price of promoting spin waves to independent degrees of freedom , which will generally violate local entropy maximization . since , however , local equilibrium requires spin and vorticity to be aligned , eq .",

    "one can than use the hamilton principle of action minimization , @xmath80 with the proviso that the functional implementation of this principle will lead to a generalization of the usual euler - lagrange equations since this lagrangian in our case depends on second derivatives of fields .",

    "in addition to generally breaking isotropy and vorticity conservation , unlike non - polarized case the higher gradient of the four velocity will be the third one ( fourth one in the fields @xmath7 ) .",
    "this system of equation has no easy solutions , however the situations is much simper if one considers the small perturbations from a static background , as it has already be done for the non polarized case ( see for instance  @xcite ) . to understand the consequences of this ,",

    "[ vort ] . at small vorticity creating polarization is preferable than creating vortices , at large vorticity this effect is small ) .",
    "hence , we expect this non - linearity to create an effective `` soft energy gap '' for vortices , ensuring they only form when applied angular momentum is large enough .",
    "such a gap could alleviate the instabilities seen in @xcite and it will be interesting to see if a more quantitative estimate of this effect can be made .    in conclusion",
    ", we developed the effective theory for hydrodynamics in the limit where the mean free path is negligible but the microscopic degrees of freedom exhibit microscopic polarization .",
    "this theory is likely to be highly relevant to the phenomenology of global polarization of hadronic collisions @xcite and might have an impact to the description of chiral observables @xcite .",
    "the third order gradient nature of this theory might also impact the question of weather a lower quantum viscosity limit is realized in nature .",

    "<S> we use lagrangian effective field theory techniques to construct the equations of motion for an ideal relativistic fluid whose constituent degrees of freedom have microscopic polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the meaning of such a system , and argue that it is the first term in the eft appropriate for describing polarization observables in heavy ion collisions , such as final state particle polarization and chiral magnetic and vortaic effects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this system will generally require non - dissipative dynamics at higher order in gradient than second order , leading to potential stability issues known with such systems . </S>",
