    "steady states is suddenly violated .",
    "what we find instead are oscillating mixed states with ( almost ) vanishing average current density , hence a non  transparent region .",
    "we explain this observation with the quantum zeno effect @xcite by identifying the loss rate @xmath141 with the rate of a generalized measurement , which  repeated at high frequencies  stops the unitary time evolution and forces the system into the lossless steady state , where no significant particle transfer from the driven to the lossy site is observed .",
    "following early theoretical considerations @xcite , the quantum zeno effect was observed in experiments with cold ions @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite . in the context of ultracold atoms ,",
    "the interplay of interactions and dissipation has received a lot of attention @xcite . applying this principle to our system",
    "we first note that only the dissipative sites ( in this case only the ones at the left boundary @xmath178 ) are being `` measured '' , which means that only the reduced density operators on these sites become time  independent in the limit of frequent measurements , i.e.  strong dissipation .",
    "in fact , in the limiting case the local density operators will be equal to the local vacuum .",
    "the rest of the system will henceforth pursue it s own unitary time evolution , where the coupling to the dissipative site is simply disabled .",
    "this explains why we can not find quasi ",
    "steady states at large dissipation , because the only steady states under unitary time evolution are eigenstates of @xmath179 and for arbitrary initial states , composed of many different eigenstates of @xmath179 , observables do not converge .",
    "the transition at @xmath177 occurs at the point where the time scales of the local measurement @xmath180 and the competing hopping process at rate @xmath0 are balanced . at this point",
    "the current / particle transfer is maximal since particle loss occurs at the same rate as the hopping , which fills up the dissipative sites again .",
    "if the dissipation is any stronger this filling process will be suppressed .    from this discussion it is already apparent that the dissipation is the prevalent ingredient for a description of the transport in this system .",
    "microscopically , this can be understood from a wave picture , where excess currents are reflected from a hard wall and destructive interference of counter  propagating waves takes place .",
    "we confirm this assumption by examining snapshots of the current distribution at small times , see fig .",
    "[ fig : current_reflection ] , before the quasi  steady state regime has been reached . by observing the time evolution of easily identifiable current peaks we find that for weak @xmath141 only a small proportion of particles is reflected while the majority is transmitted to the lossy site and lost eventually , fig .",
    "[ fig : current_reflection](a ) .",
    "however , for a large enough ratio @xmath175 , currents are reflected  not at the system boundary , but at the lossy site , fig .",
    "[ fig : current_reflection](b ) . peaks traveling towards the dissipative edge will change the direction , i.e.  the sign of the current , just before the dissipative site . as a consequence",
    "the dissipative site is effectively decoupled from the system .",
    "the oscillations in the region with @xmath181 can be explained in the wave picture as well .",
    "since perfect destructive interference of reflected components would require suitable geometric conditions , which we do not alter throughout our simulations , the process of particles `` bouncing '' back and forth will lead to a small current distribution , which is difficult to average out completely .",
    "the source  drain setup is the simplest way to describe transport through the system , neglecting the penetration depth of the laser into the medium and de - excitations in the bulk .",
    "typically , lattices are formed of identical cavities , whose individual mode excitations have the same decay rates , so that a constant bulk decay rate is more realistic . in order to simulate the penetration of the laser into the medium we consider a decaying laser amplitude @xmath29 as a function of the penetration depth . in the simplest case",
    "this would be a linear decay with bulk dissipation present : @xmath182 where @xmath5 denotes the site index in @xmath26-direction and no explicit @xmath25-dependence is given , as before .    for the setup ( [ eq : intensitygradient ] )",
    "we investigate the dependence of the currents on an overall laser field @xmath183 and an  on top \" gradient @xmath184 .",
    "it turns out that the larger the offset field @xmath183 , the lower the overall current , fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude_driveu](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude_driveu](b ) we observe a peak in the photon transport at @xmath185 and a strongly suppressed transport for any other value of @xmath183 .",
    "the effect can be understood by realizing that the off - set field corresponds to the phase imprinting with phase zero , i.e. we are pumping a mode that does nt support any current .",
    "effects of the gradient @xmath186 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude_driveu](b ) . at low @xmath186 ,",
    "the system compensates for the imbalance between neighboring sites via coherent transport of photons along the gradient and as expected , the gradient enhances the current .",
    "however , at a certain value of the @xmath186 the imbalance is so strong that the incoherent dynamics becomes the dominant process .",
    "motivated by ongoing research interest in arrays of coupled photonic cavities , we have investigated different possibilities to optimize coherent transport in this setup .",
    "we have started from the non  interacting limit , where simple relations between the bond current and externally tunable parameters can be established . to address the role of interactions we have employed the gutzwiller mean  field theory and a simpler gross ",
    "like approach when possible .    in the case where bond currents are introduced by phase engineering of the external lasers ,",
    "we have found that weak interactions shift the driving frequency that leads to a peak in the current toward higher values . on the other hand , in the strongly interacting regime of this setup , multiphotonic resonances of a single driven cavity lead to multiple peaks of the current as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "the lattice filling is set by the strength of the applied driving field @xmath29 and the dissipation rate @xmath148 , but interactions can modify the @xmath123 proportionality into either a weaker @xmath187 gain or into an effectively stronger gain in the vicinity of multiphotonic resonances .    in the source  drain setup",
    ", local dissipation @xmath141 proves to be the tuning parameter that allows to maximize the bond current .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath141 is set by the intrinsic hopping rate of the underlying bose  hubbard model .",
    "further increase of @xmath141 leads to the quantum zeno dynamics that suppresses uniform currents .",
    "the effects of the applied driving @xmath29 turn out to be especially simple in the interacting case : the steady state is either stable at the specific value of @xmath29 or its stationarity breaks down as stronger driving strength would be required to balance the dissipation .",
    "the main approximation of our analysis is the employed mean - field approach together with the simplified form of the bond current , that limits to the regime of the strong bosonic coherences .",
    "the contribution of non  trivial correlations becomes important in the limit of very strong interactions and weak driving and this case should be treated in the future using beyond mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the main effects we have identified at finite coherences will not be modified by the inclusion of higher order terms . another interesting research direction would be to connect our results with well  established results describing heat transport on the microscopic level @xcite .",
