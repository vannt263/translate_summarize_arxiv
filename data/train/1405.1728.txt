    "recently the nnpdf collaboration published sets of parton distribution functions with qed corrections , the so called nnpdf2.3qed sets @xcite .",
    "these sets contain the photon pdf with its uncertainty determined for the first time from dis and drell - yan lhc data . in this work we estimate and compare to the pdf uncertainties the contributions to the invariant mass of the drell - yan @xmath1-boson production due to electroweak corrections and the photon - induced channel , by considering the low - mass region , which is below the @xmath1 peak resonance and the high - mass tail .",
    "in contrast to what was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite where predictions were computed with fewz , here we propose to combine two distinct parton level public codes : dynnlo  @xcite for the nlo qcd prediction and horace  @xcite which provides the exact @xmath2 electroweak radiative correction together with the photon - induced channel for the @xmath1 production .",
    "the motivation for this combination is the interest to measure the difference between predictions with electroweak effects at nlo / nnlo qcd accuracy computed in the improved born approximation ( iba ) instead of using electroweak correction computed by fewz in the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "the main difference between these choices is that effective couplings in the iba reabsorb higher - order electroweak corrections and therefore it provides predictions in better agreement with experimental data .",
    "computations are performed exclusively with the nnpdf23_nlo_as_0119_qed set of pdfs instead of using the respective lo and nnlo sets because here we will focus only on the nlo qcd accuracy and that is why we use a nlo set . in the next sections ,",
    "we first show the differences at born level between the improved born approximation ( iba ) , available in horace by default , and the @xmath0 scheme in dynnlo , then , we proceed with the construction of the full prediction .",
    "born level predictions and respective ratios for low- ( left ) and high - mass ( right ) drell - yan , @xmath3 production , using the iba and the @xmath0 scheme . at low - mass",
    "there is a constant gap of 3 - 4% for all bins , while at high - mass , predictions increase progressively with the invariant mass , producing discrepancies of 7 - 8% in the last bin.,title=\"fig : \" ] born level predictions and respective ratios for low- ( left ) and high - mass ( right ) drell - yan , @xmath3 production , using the iba and the @xmath0 scheme . at low - mass",
    "there is a constant gap of 3 - 4% for all bins , while at high - mass , predictions increase progressively with the invariant mass , producing discrepancies of 7 - 8% in the last bin.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to obtain realistic results , which are ready for comparisons with real data , we have selected the kinematic range and cuts inspired by recent measurements performed by the atlas experiment for low- and high - mass drell - yan differential cross - section at @xmath4 tev @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : iba ] shows the predicted distribution at born level using the iba ( horace ) and the @xmath0 scheme ( dynnlo ) at low ( left plot ) and high ( right plot ) invariant mass regions , for the drell - yan process : @xmath5 . here",
    ", the goal is to measure the numerical differences due to the choice of these methodologies .",
    "for all distributions , the monte carlo uncertainty is below the percent level .",
    "we have computed predictions with the nnpdf23_nlo_as_0119_qed set of pdfs because this is the set that we use to build the complete prediction at nlo in qcd with electroweak effects .",
    "the uncertainties shown in the figure have been calculated as the 1-@xmath6 interval obtained after averaging over the 100 replicas provided by this set . in the low - mass region , we have applied kinematic cuts to the lepton pair imposing : @xmath7 gev and @xmath8 as in atlas  @xcite . in this region",
    "we observe an almost flat gap of 3 - 4% between the iba and @xmath0 predictions , however in the bin @xmath9 gev the difference is slightly higher . on the other hand , in the high - mass region",
    "we have applied the following kinematic cuts : @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 as in ref .",
    "we observe a progressive increase of the central value prediction as a function of the invariant mass , reaching a maximum of 7 - 8% at the highest bin in @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that the running of @xmath13 in the iba can play a crucial role when determining with accuracy the predictions in such region .",
    "it is important to highlight that in both cases , pdf uncertainties are smaller than the observed differences induced by the choice of the scheme . these results are fully consistent with the iba implementation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the sequel we are interested in combining electroweak effects with higher order qcd corrections in the iba and",
    "then compare these results to pure qcd @xmath0 predictions .",
    "comparison of predictions and respective ratios for low- ( left ) and high - mass ( right ) drell - yan , @xmath3 production .",
    "we compare the nlo qcd prediction provided by dynnlo ( green distribution ) with : the combined prediction with @xmath14 ( red distribution ) and with the @xmath15 ( blue distribution).,title=\"fig : \" ] comparison of predictions and respective ratios for low- ( left ) and high - mass ( right ) drell - yan , @xmath3 production .",
    "we compare the nlo qcd prediction provided by dynnlo ( green distribution ) with : the combined prediction with @xmath14 ( red distribution ) and with the @xmath15 ( blue distribution).,title=\"fig : \" ]    at this point , we are interested in building a prediction based on iba which includes nlo qcd with @xmath2 correction and the photon - induced channel .",
    "we propose to extract the nlo correction from dynnlo by removing its born level , which contains the direct and strong dependence on the @xmath0 scheme , and combine the result with the horace prediction .",
    "schematically this can be achieved by defining the quantities : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the born levels presented in figure  [ fig : iba ] , @xmath19 the nlo qcd , @xmath14 the @xmath2 electroweak correction and @xmath20 the photon - induced contribution .    the combination is then constructed in the following way : @xmath21 where we remove the dynnlo born level while we include the nlo qcd correction in the final prediction .",
    "we are aware that using this methodology we improve the combination but we do not remove entirely the pure @xmath0 dependence at higher orders , however this is the best combination we can propose without applying technical modifications to both codes . in figure",
    "[ fig : full ] we compare @xmath22 with @xmath23 , the combination presented in eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , with and without the @xmath20 term . for all distributions",
    "we compute the 1-@xmath6 uncertainty except when including the photon - induced channel where we have used the 68% c.l . as in ref .",
    ".    in the low - mass region the inclusion of @xmath2 electroweak corrections has a strong impact on the last four bins , where differences can reach @xmath24 in comparison to the pure nlo qcd @xmath0 prediction , while the same correction for the high - mass distribution shows a moderate impact which is below @xmath25 for the highest invariant mass bin .",
    "this behavior is expected and derives from the shape of the @xmath1-boson invariant mass : bins located in a region lower than the @xmath1 peak resonance undergoes large positive corrections while at high invariant mass we observe a change of sign of such corrections .",
    "it is important to highlight that modern data provided by the lhc experiments are already corrected by final - state photon radiation which carries a dominant fraction of the electroweak effects shown in figure  [ fig : full ] .",
    "the photon - induced contribution has a moderate impact in the low - mass region while for high - mass it is dominant : this behavior is expected and due to the presence of the @xmath1 peak resonance where the photon - induced channel is negligible . also from these plots of figure  [ fig : full ] , it is important to emphasize again that modern pdf sets , as the nnpdf2.3qed , have uncertainties which are accurate enough to appreciate the differences due to scheme choices and electroweak effects , including the new photon pdf , which shows a stable behavior of uncertainties in all invariant mass regions except at very high - mass bins where uncertainties grow , reaching more than @xmath25 .",
    "this situation will be improved in future by including more relevant and precise data to constrain the photon pdf .",
    "we have shown that the choice of the coupling scheme clearly modifies the predictions when looking at realistic experimental regions for the @xmath1-boson production .",
    "we have constructed a combined prediction which includes the @xmath2 electroweak corrections together with the photon - induced channel in the iba using public codes .",
    "we show that uncertainties from modern pdf sets are smaller than electroweak effects and therefore such corrections will provide noticeable differences when extracting future pdf sets .",
    "finally , in a future work we expect to provide a similar study for other processes and kinematic regions , by propagating consistently the iba to higher orders and producing a direct comparison to the fewz results .",
