    "during the last decade a remarkable progress has been experienced in trapping and cooling atoms . in this respect",
    "the creation of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and degenerate fermi gases @xcite has been the prime achievement .",
    "the atomic becs and degenerate fermi gases are systems where an atomic physicist often meets physical phenomena encountered in condensed matter physics .",
    "for instance , atoms in optical lattices are often studied using the hubbard model @xcite familiar from solid state physics .",
    "atoms forming quantum gases are electrically neutral particles and there is no vector potential type coupling of the atoms with a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , a direct analogy between the magnetic properties of degenerate atomic gases and solid state phenomena is not necessarily straightforward .",
    "it is possible to produce an effective magnetic field in a cloud of electrically neutral atoms by rotating the system such that the vector potential will appear in the rotating frame of reference @xcite .",
    "this would correspond to a situation where the atoms feel a uniform magnetic field . yet stirring an ultracold cloud of atoms in a controlled manner",
    "is a rather demanding task .",
    "there have also been suggestions to take advantage of a discrete periodic structure of an optical lattice to introduce assymetric atomic transitions between the lattice sites @xcite .",
    "using this approach one can induce a nonvanishing phase for the atoms moving along a closed path on the lattice , i.e. one can simulate a magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "however such a way of creating the effective magnetic field is inapplicable to an atomic gas that does not constitute a lattice .",
    "a significant experimental advantage would be gained if a more direct way could be used to induce an effective magnetic field . in a previous letter @xcite , we have shown how this can be done using two light beams in an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) configuration . here",
    "we present a more complete account of the phenomenon .",
    "we demonstrate that if at least one of these beams contains an orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , an effective magnetic field appears , which acts on the electrically neutral atoms . in other words ,",
    "the coupling between the light and the atoms will provide an effective vector potential in the atomic equations of motion . compared to the rotating atomic gas , where only a constant effective magnetic field is created @xcite ,",
    "using optical means will be advantageous since the effective magnetic field can now be shaped by choosing proper control and probe beams .",
    "note that the appearance of our effective vector potential is a manifestation of the berry connection which is encountered in many different areas of physics @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] we define a system of three level atoms in the @xmath0-configuration and present the equations of motion for the atoms interacting with the control and probe beams of light . in doing this",
    "we allow the two beams to have orbital angular momenta along the propagation axis @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dark ] we derive equations of motion for the center of mass of atoms driven to the dark state .",
    "the equations of motion contain the terms due to effective vector and trapping potentials describing an effective magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to our previous letter @xcite , the emerging effective potentials are now fully hermitian . yet",
    ", the two formulations are shown to give the same effective magnetic field and hence are equivalent . in secs .",
    "[ sec : oam][sec : spec ] we analyze the effective magnetic field and effective trapping potential in the case where at least one of the light beams contains an orbital angular momentum .",
    "we show that the spatial profile of the effective magnetic field can be controlled by applying proper control and probe beams . the concluding sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes the findings .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec : app ] contains technical details of some of the derivations .",
    "let us consider a system of atoms characterized by two hyper - fine ground levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as well as an electronic excited level @xmath4 .",
    "the atoms interact with two resonant laser beams in the eit configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ bildschema]b ) .",
    "the first beam ( to be referred to as the control beam ) drives the transition @xmath5 , whereas the second beam ( the probe beam ) is coupled with the transition @xmath6 , a wave - vector @xmath7 , and a rabi frequency @xmath8 . the probe field , on the other hand",

    "the one - particle wave function @xmath22 is replaced by the operator @xmath22 for annihilation of an atom positioned at @xmath24 and characterized by an internal state @xmath23 .",
    "a set of such operators @xmath22 obeys the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac commutation relationships depending on the type of atoms involved . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath22 can be understood either as the three - component atomic wave function or as the annihilation field operator . in both cases",
    "the spatial and temporal variables will be kept implicit , @xmath26 .      introducing the slowly - varying atomic field - operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and adopting the rotating wave approximation ,",

    "the equations of motion ( [ eq - at - g2])-([eq - at - q2 ] ) do not accommodate collisions between the ground - state atoms .",
    "this is a legitimate approximation for a degenerate fermi gas in which s - wave scattering is forbidden and only weak p - wave scattering is present @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the atoms in the hyperfine ground states @xmath2 and @xmath3 form a bec , collisions will be present between these atoms",
    ". the collisional interaction can however be accommodated if eqs .",
    "( [ eq - at - g2 ] ) and ( [ eq - at - q2 ] ) are replaced by the mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) equations for the condensate wave - functions , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the s - wave scattering length of the atoms in the electronic states @xmath23 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "in particular @xmath40 is the length of the s - wave scattering between a pair of atoms in the same electronic state ( @xmath41 ) , whereas @xmath42 corresponds to collisions between atoms in different electronic states .",
    "since the occupation of the excited atomic level @xmath4 is small , the atom - atom scattering is of little importance for these atoms and equation ( [ eq - at - e2 ] ) for @xmath43 can therefore be left unaltered .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the annihilation field operators for the atoms in the dark and bright states , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ratio of the amplitudes of the control and probe fields",
    ".    we shall be especially interested in a situation where the atoms are driven to their dark states , described by the creation field operator @xmath46 acting on the atomic vacuum @xmath47 . if an atom is in the dark state @xmath48 , the resonant control and probe beams induce the absorption paths @xmath49 which interfere destructively , resulting in the electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "in fact , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq - at - e2 ] ) , the transitions to the upper atomic level @xmath4 are then suppressed , so the atomic level @xmath4 is weakly populated .",
    "this justifies neglection of losses due to spontaneous emissions by the excited atoms in the equation ( [ eq - at - e2 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "a transformed set of operators @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 obeys the following equations of motion ( see appendix a ) : @xmath52\\phi_3+\\hbar\\omega\\phi_b\\ , , \\label{eq : psi3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the total rabi frequency , @xmath54 is the _ effective vector potential _ and @xmath55 are the _ effective trapping potentials _ for the atoms in the dark and bright states , respectively",

    "in such a situation the term @xmath56 can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi - d ] ) , so it is sufficient to consider a single equation describing the translational motion of the atoms in the dark state : @xmath61 assuming that the control and probe fields are tuned to the one- and two - photon resonances ( @xmath62 ) , the adiabatic approach holds if the matrix elements of the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 are much smaller than the total rabi frequency @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to the following requirement for the velocity - dependent term in @xmath56 @xmath64 here the velocity - dependent term @xmath65 reflects the two - photon doppler detuning .",
    "note that the estimation ( [ condition - adiabatic ] ) does not accommodate effects due to the decay of the excited atoms .",
    "the dissipation effects can be included replacing the energy of the one - photon detuning @xmath66 by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the excited - state decay rate .",
    "in such a situation , the dark state can be shown to acquire a finite lifetime @xmath69 which should be large compared to other characteristic times of the system .",

    "we have shown how to generate a constant effective magnetic field , as well as a field exhibiting a radial distance dependence .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effective magnetic field can be concentrated in the area where the effective trapping potential holds the atoms . in the case of a homogeneous effective magnetic field",
    "it is important to realize that the corresponding cyclotron frequencies and magnetic lengths can be similar to typical trap frequencies and oscillator lengths used when trapping cold atoms in bec and degenerate fermion gases .",
    "this will require a high oam for the light which is also readily available with present technology .",
    "the theory is based on the adiabatic approximation according to which the atoms should remain in the dark state .",
    "we have estimated that the adiabatic approximation should hold for atomic velocities up to tens of meters per second , i.e. , up to extremely large velocities in the context of ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "such an estimate is lowered if the spontaneous decay of the excited atoms is taken into account .",
    "the atomic dark state accquires then a velocity - dependent lifetime .",
    "for instance , if the atomic velocities are of the order of a centimeter per second , the atoms should survive in their dark states up to a few seconds , which is comparable to a typical lifetime of an atomic bec .",
    "our proposed method of creating the effective magnetic field has several advantages compared to a rotating system where only a constant magnetic field is created @xcite . in our method the magnetic field is shaped and controlled by choosing the proper control and probe beams . furthermore stirring an ultra - cold cloud of atoms in a controlled manner",

    "the theory has already been applied analyzing the de haas - van alphen effect in a gas of electrically neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "it can also be applied to other intriguing phenomena which intrinsically depend on the magnetic field .",
    "for instance , the quantum hall effect can now be studied using a cold gas of electrically neutral atomic fermions .",
    "in addition , if the collisional interaction between the atoms is taken into account , we can study the magnetic properties of a superfluid atomic fermi gas @xcite .",
    "recent advances in spatial light modulator technology enables us to consider rather exotic light beams @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to study the effect of different forms of vector potentials in quantum gases .",
    "finally the combined dynamical system of light and matter @xcite could give an important insight into gauge theories in general .",
