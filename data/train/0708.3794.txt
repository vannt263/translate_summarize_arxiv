    "manipulating quantum system by using time - dependent electric field remains a goal of primary interests in different physical processes extending from the control of chemical reactions @xcite to quantum computing @xcite . in recent years",
    ", active research has been performed to take into account the interaction of the system with the environment which represents more realistic situations but also more challenging control scenarios than for closed quantum systems @xcite .",
    "different control strategies have been proposed . in this paper",
    "we will not consider control techniques using non - unitary control such as measurement ( see for instance the quantum zeno effect ) @xcite , or other strategies such as bang - bang pulses , strong coupling with another system or control that can actively act on the dissipation ( see @xcite for a recent review and references therein ) .",
    "it has been shown that such methods are particularly efficient and can even halt decoherence .",
    "we restrict our study to unitary control . in this case and for the interaction with a markovian or a non - markovian bath",
    ", the fact that the control field can not fully compensate the effect of dissipation largely enhances the difficulty of the control .",
    "this point has been rigourously shown in refs .",
    "@xcite for a dynamics governed by the lindblad equation @xcite . in this context",
    ", several studies using numerical optimization techniques have proved that efficient control can still be achieved @xcite . due to the complexity of realistic systems with multiple degrees of freedom , this purely numerical approach seems to be the only possible way to achieve control .",
    "more geometrical aspects of the control using mainly tools of geometric control theory @xcite can be formulated only for simplest quantum systems having few levels ( typically two or three ) or consisting in the coupling of spin @xmath0 particles .",
    "this has been done recently by a large number of mathematical papers dealing with closed @xcite or dissipative @xcite quantum systems .",
    "one of the objectives of the control has been the minimization of the total time of the process either with constraints @xcite or no constraints on the laser intensity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to do a step towards the geometrical analysis of the control of dissipative quantum systems by beginning with the simplest system possible , a two - level system governed by the lindblad equation .",
    "we determine control fields which minimize the total time of the process by applying the pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the laser intensity is fixed to an arbitrary value .",
    "an increase of this value leads to a reduction of the duration of the control .",
    "note also that this cost functional seems particularly relevant in the context of a dissipative environment especially when the effect of dissipation is undesirable to reach the objective of the control . a second argument explaining our choice of cost functional is of mathematical nature .",
    "the resolution of the pmp is particularly simple in this case and can be done analytically .",
    "the geometrical description of the time - optimal control is also well developed especially on @xmath1 ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) for affine systems with a drift term corresponding here to the dissipation . the main tools of this construction will be recalled throughout the paper .",
    "finally , all this mathematical arsenal allows us to answer some physical questions such as the benefit that can be gained from dissipation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the model for the lindblad equation of a two - level system .",
    "writing the density matrix in the coherence vector form @xcite and assuming some constraints on the control term , we restrict the problem to a control on a closed submanifold of @xmath1 with a true drift term i.e. an uncontrollable term which can not be eliminated by a unitary transformation . this drift term is due to the dissipation .",

    "a bang - bang trajectory is the concatenation of an @xmath98 and an @xmath99 trajectories .",
    "we denote by @xmath185 such a concatenation where the @xmath99 trajectory comes first . here",
    "the maximum number of switches is thus equal to 1 .",
    "the elimination of extremal trajectories selected by the pontryagin maximum principle has been done through the clock form @xmath164 ( see appendix [ appa ] for details ) and the symmetry of the diagram with respect to the line @xmath81 .",
    "we recall that the clock form can only be used for trajectories belonging to one of the four quadrants defined by @xmath65 and which do not cross @xmath64 .",

    "the plot of @xmath136 shows that the switches are always permitted along the @xmath98 or the @xmath99 trajectory .",
    "note also that the form of the curve representing @xmath136 is related to the sign of @xmath187 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath93 then @xmath136 is a monotonically decreasing function and if @xmath188 ( case not treated here ) , @xmath136 starts increasing , passes through a maximum when the trajectory crosses @xmath65 and then decreases .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath189 corresponds to the case ( b ) . using the clock form",
    ", it can be shown that only one switch is possible for a trajectory in a given quadrant .",
    "this point can also be determined from more general considerations detailed in ref .",
    "the rest of the optimal synthesis is deduced from the symmetry of the problem .",
    "the line @xmath81 is called an overlap curve denoted by @xmath190 as it is the locus of points reached by two optimal trajectories .",
