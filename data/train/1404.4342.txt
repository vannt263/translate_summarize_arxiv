    "the fruitful idea of constructing new graphs starting from smaller factor graphs is very popular in mathematics and it has been largely studied and developed in the literature for its theoretical interest , as well as for its numerous applications in several branches like combinatorics , probability , theoretical computer science , statistical mechanics .    this paper is devoted to the study of the connectedness and isomorphism properties of zig - zag products of graphs .",
    "this combinatorial construction , which applies to regular graphs , was introduced in @xcite by o. reingold , s. vadhan and a. wigderson , in order to provide new sequences of constant degree expanders of arbitrary size .",
    "informally , a graph is expander if it is simultaneously sparse , i.e. , it has relatively few edges , and highly connected .",
    "what is mostly fascinating about expander graphs , is the fact that the expansion property can be described from several points of view - combinatorial , algebraic and probabilistic .",
    "expander graphs have many interesting applications in different areas of computer science , such as design and analysis of communication networks and error correcting codes , as well as in many computational problems , by playing a crucial role also in statistical physics , computational group theory , and optimization @xcite .",
    "the zig - zag product is strictly related to a simpler construction , called replacement product of graphs .",
    "the replacement and the zig - zag product play an important role in geometric group theory , since it turns out that , when applied to cayley graphs of two finite groups , they provide the cayley graph of the semidirect product of these groups @xcite .",
    "further results about the relationship between graph products and group operations are given in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sectionpreliminaries ]",
    "we recall the definition and the basic properties of the replacement and zig - zag product of graphs . in section [ sectionconnectedness ]",
    ", we attack the connectedness problem for zig - zag products of regular graphs . in section [ sectionclassifications ] , we focus our attention on the classification of the isomorphism classes of zig - zag products in the case where the second factor graph is a cycle graph of even length . in this context , we prove that the connected components of the zig - zag product are in one - to - one correspondence with the so - called parity blocks , introduced in subsection [ subsectionblocks ]",
    ". these are subgraphs of the first factor of the zig - zag product , considered together with the bi - labelling of its edges .",
    "the isomorphism problem is treated by associating with any parity block ( and so with any connected component of the zig - zag product ) a new simpler graph , that we call pseudo - replacement graph .",
    "the pseudo - replacement graph contains , in general , less vertices and edges , and has a smaller degree than the corresponding connected component of the zig - zag product .",
    "nevertheless , it completely encodes the isomorphism properties of each connected component ( see subsection [ subsectioniso ] ) . in the case where the cycle graph has length @xmath0 ,",
    "we show that the structure of the zig - zag product is very regular : it consists of highly symmetric graphs that we call double cycle graphs ( see subsection [ subsectionquattro ] ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that the zig - zag product of graphs is not injective , as two non isomorphic graphs can produce isomorphic zig - zag products . in this setting",
    ", we are also able to perform a complete spectral analysis , by using the fact that the adjacency matrices of the double cycle graphs are circulant .",
    "interesting sequences of increasing regular graphs can be obtained by considering the schreier graphs of the action of groups generated by finite automata . in section [ basilicasection ] , we describe an application of the zig - zag product to this setting .",
    "the class of automata groups became very popular after the introduction of the grigorchuk group , that was the first example of a group with intermediate growth ( see @xcite for the definition and further references ) .",
    "surprising deep connections between groups generated by automata , complex dynamics , fractal geometry have been discovered , and they constitute a very exciting topic of investigation in modern mathematics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "sequences of finite schreier graphs represent a discrete approximation of fractal limit objects associated with such groups .",
    "this point of view can also be exploited in the study of models coming from statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the main results achieved in the current paper can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "a sufficient condition for the connectedness of the zig - zag product @xmath1 is given in terms of the connectedness of a new graph @xmath2 , called the neighborhood graph of @xmath3 .",
    "the construction of @xmath2 depends only on the structure of @xmath3 and the number of vertices equals the number of vertices of @xmath3 ( theorem [ teoremaconnessione ] ) .",
    "* there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the parity blocks in the parity block decomposition of @xmath4 , and the connected components of the graph @xmath1 ( theorem [ decomposition ] ) .",
    "* there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of the connected components of the zig - zag product and the isomorphism classes of the corresponding pseudo - replacement graphs ( theorem [ iso ] ) . * in the case @xmath5 , the connected components of the zig - zag product are isomorphic to double cycle graphs @xmath6 , for some @xmath7 ( proposition [ propprop ] ) . *",
    "if @xmath8 is the sequence of schreier graphs associated with the action of the basilica group , then , for each @xmath9 , the graph @xmath10 is connected and isomorphic to the double cycle graph @xmath11 ( proposition [ basilicaruote ] ) ; the spectral analysis of the graphs @xmath10 is explicitly performed ( theorem [ basilicaspettro ] ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the replacement and the zig - zag product of two regular graphs . for this , we recall first some basic definitions and properties of regular graphs , and we fix the notation for the rest of the paper .",
