    "et al._@xcite and this work which must go beyond the differences in stuffing between our polycrystal and single - crystal samples .",
    "most importantly , our results suggest that , from a local microscopic point of view , the magnetic ground state is to a large extent insensitive to some aspects of sample variation and that a sharp specific heat transition does not signify magnetic order .    our weak lf measurements , shown in fig .  [ zf_data ] exhibit a weakly temperature dependent spin fluctuation rate down to the lowest temperature considered .",
    "many frustrated pyrochlore systems exhibit a substantial , largely temperature independent lf / zf relaxation  @xcite which , although often seen in frustrated or low - dimensional magnetic systems , have not yet been explained  @xcite .",
    "a recently proposed explanation for these apparent persistent spin dynamics in terms of quantum diffusion of muons , and suggested for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite , is untenable here ( and likely in that case as well as we would expect similar muon diffusion behavior in the two systems ) .",
    "if muons were mobile in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , they would most likely move between different magnetically inequivalent sites which would broaden all of the individual tf lines in fig .  3 into one , which clearly does not occur .",
    "a recent zf-@xmath0sr study of y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 also concluded that quantum diffusion was absent in that related material@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can exclude a `` muon impurity '' effect in which the presence of the muon would locally destroy the magnetic behavior , since our tf-@xmath0sr measurements are clearly sensitive to the transition which strongly affects our measured muon knight shift ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 in the polycrystalline ( and stoichiometric ) form exhibits a clear thermodynamic phase transition evidenced by specific heat measurements that is accompanied by the marked change in the muon knight shift in fig .",
    "4a . on the other hand ,",
    "the broad anomaly observed in the single crystal heat capacity may be indicative of a crossover , rather than a thermodynamic phase transition , and consistent with the smoother shift seen in fig .",
    "4b compared to fig .",
    "4a . we did not perform a detailed search for hysteresis at this transition which precludes us from making a definitive statement regarding its order .",
    "the specific heat anomaly in the polycrystal is extremely sharp which could be evidence for a first order transition , but further measurements will be required to confirm this .",
    "this leaves the nature of the low temperature state unresolved , although we do know that it involves at least a change of the local spin susceptibility and/or hyperfine coupling , rather than complete magnetic ordering .",
    "this behavior reminds that of the moderate heavy fermion system uru@xmath1si@xmath1 which has a thermodynamic phase transition at 17.5  k to a so - called `` hidden - order '' state  @xcite without magnetic order and whose order parameter has remained unknown for more than 20 years of detailed investigation . in the case of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 , recent studies  @xcite indicate that the phase transition originates from a change in the hybridization between the localized electronic states associated with the uranium atoms and the conduction band , as it enters the heavy fermion state .",
    "as such a mechanism can not occur in insulating yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , we must seek another mechanism for its phase transition to a state with an unidentified order parameter .",
    "when discussing `` hidden - order '' , one often refers to the ordering of other multipoles than the magnetic dipole moment @xcite , with the electric quadrupolar ( e2 ) being typically the most important one after the magnetic dipolar moment .",
    "a transition that would involve the electrical quadrupole moments of yb@xmath8 at the first order transition in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 would seem hard to rationalize given that yb@xmath8 is a kramers ion with vanishing time even ( e.g. quadrupolar ) operator matrix elements projected in its low - energy crystal - field doublet @xcite along with a lowest excited crystal field levels at an energy @xmath52 k very large compared to the energy scale of the relevant microscopic yb@xmath8@xmath31yb@xmath8 e2 interactions .",
    "that being said , numerous exotic ground states have been proposed  @xcite for effective spin-1/2 pyrochlore kramers systems , such as yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "these include a @xmath53 quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) and a coulomb ferromagnet in addition to conventional antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "interestingly , the recent suggestion of a first order transition between a paramagnet and the @xmath53 qsl@xcite could be consistent with what we observe in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "another possibility which could be considered is a valence bond solid ( vbs ) . of these states ,",
    "the qsl and vbs would have no static magnetic moments , consistent with our results .",
    "however , it is unclear whether or how the known hamiltonian for yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite could give rise to either of these states .",
    "which of these phases or perhaps other more exotic states is realized in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 remains to be seen .",
    "the search for materials with a qsl ground state is at the forefront of theoretical and experimental condensed matter research@xcite . notwithstanding the paucity of such systems ,",
    "one of the fundamental conceptual challenges facing the field is that the identification of a qsl ground state has so far typically been `` what it is not '' ( i.e. lacking static multipolar order ) rather than what it is@xcite . moving beyond this negative assessment of a qsl is one of the central questions being investigated in the field . on the experimental side ,",
    "one still has to remain cautiously satisfied in obtaining a compelling demonstration of circumstantial evidence for a qsl state .",
    "an example is the recently reported gapless fractionalized magnetic ( spinons ) excitations in the intensively studied zncu@xmath23(od)@xmath54c@xmath55 herbertsmithite cu@xmath56 @xmath57 kagome antiferromagnet @xcite .    in our work , we have brought yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 into the not very crowded arena of compelling qsl candidates by showing , as a first essential step for further progress , that it is an effective @xmath57 three - dimensional frustrated spin system lacking static dipolar order above 16  mk .",
