    "indeed , studies of known transiting planets have revealed evidence of a correlation between planetary core mass and the metallicity of their host stars @xcite .    while the first planet detections yielded a definitive correlation between giant planet occurrence and stellar metallicity , until recently very little",
    "was known about the effects of stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the first doppler - based planet surveys concentrated primarily on stars with masses similar to the sun , both because it was desirable to find solar system analogs and because sun - like stars make excellent planet - search targets .",
    "compared to more massive stars , dwarfs with masses within @xmath5  are relatively numerous , have cool atmospheres and slow rotational velocities (  @xmath6  ) .",
    "the latter two features result in a high density of narrow absorption lines in the spectra of sun - like stars , which is ideal measuring for stellar doppler shifts to high precision .",

    "for example , it would be advantageous to know whether the correlation is purely linear , or if it can instead be better described as some other functional form . besides informing theories of planet formation , an improved understanding of the relationship between planet occurrence and stellar mass will also help guide the target selection of future surveys , and aid in the interpretation of results of current and future planet - search efforts .",

    "these unpublished candidates all have more than 10 observations over @xmath45 years , but lack strong enough constraints on the orbital parameters for publication .",
    "however , since the present study is concerned with planet _ occurrence _ we feel confident in including these secure , yet unpublished detections in our sample .",
    "all of the unpublished candidates have radial velocity variations consistent with doppler amplitudes and periods that meet our criteria for uniform detectability .",
    "our sample of planet detections comprises 5 planets around m dwarfs , 74 planets around the spocs sample of fgk dwarfs , and 36 planets around subgiants .",
    "in our analysis we treat stellar mass and metallicity as separate independent variables affecting the likelihood that a star harbors a planet .",
    "the validity of this premise rests in part on the analysis of fv05 , who noted an artificial correlation between mass and metallicity in the spocs sample that is due to the color and magnitude cuts used in the target selection : the more massive stars in the spocs sample have higher metallicities than the lower - mass stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "is that there are far fewer planet detections , both in an absolute and fractional sense , compared to the higher - mass stellar samples .",
    "the far right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : massmet ] shows that the metallicity offset between stars with and without planets is also present among the more massive subgiants , albeit at lower statistical significance . like the fgk dwarfs ,",
    "the subgiants have a artificial mass - metallicity correlation , owing to the red cutoff of ( @xmath46 ) used in the selection of the subgiants from the _ hipparcos _ catalog . a much higher fraction of massive stars have detected planets than do the m or fgk dwarfs .",
    "the metallicity offsets among the stars with and without planets in the three mass - bins in figure  [ fig : massmet ] are suggestive of a pmc that spans an order of magnitude in mass , from 0.2  to 2.0  .",
    "also seen among the three mass bins is a steadily increasing planet occurrence rate : while only 3.3% of the m dwarfs have a planet , 20% of the retired a stars harbor one or more giant planets .",
    "this is strong evidence that planet occurrence correlates with stellar mass , separately from the effects of stellar metallicity . in the following sections we examine these trends in further detail",
    "we derive a parametric relationship between stellar properties and fraction of stars with planets using bayesian inference . the resulting function , while ad hoc , can be used to predict yields of future planet surveys , interpret the results of ongoing planet search efforts , and compared directly to the output of theoretical models of planet formation .",

    "since we assume that mass and metallicity produce separate effects , the fraction of stars with planets as a function of mass and metallicity can be described by    @xmath52    we note that there exist many possible functional forms for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , any monotonic function should provide an adequate fit to our data set .",
    "for example , @xcite use a logistic function to describe planet fraction as a function of stellar @xmath55-element abundance , and they note that a power law is simply an approximation to the low - yield tail of such a function .",
    "however , we have decided to use power law descriptions  @xmath56 , the exponential term in equation  [ eqn : model ] is a power law relationship of the number of iron atoms : @xmath57 . ] due to the simplicity of the functional form and for ease of comparison with previous studies .      for conciseness",
    ", we denote the parameters in equation  [ eqn : model ] by @xmath58 .",
    "the parameters can be inferred from the measured number of planet hosts @xmath59 drawn from a larger sample of @xmath60 targets using bayes theorem :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 denotes the probability of @xmath58 conditioned on the data @xmath63 . in our analysis ,",

    ", there still exists a nearly linear increase owing to stellar mass alone ( diamonds ) .",
    "thus , there is an approximately order - of - magnitude increase in planet occurrence over the mass range spanning m dwarfs to a - type stars .",
    "similarly , some of the metallicity relationship is due to the higher stellar masses among the metal - rich stars .",
    "however , there still exists a strong metallicity correlation spanning more than an order of magnitude in iron abundance .    in the following section we compare our results to those of related studies .",
    "fv05 studied planet occurrence as a function of metallicity among the sun - like portion of our stellar sample and found @xmath82 . by restricting our analysis to the spocs subset of our sample that overlaps with fv05 , and by fitting a function of metallicity alone we find @xmath88 , which agrees with the fv05 value to within our 68.2% confidence interval .",
    "the significance of the difference is reduced further if we assume the uncertainty in their measurement is comparable to ours .    by fitting for both mass and metallicity we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which agree with the values in table  1 measured for the full stellar sample .",
    "this provides assurance that our analysis is not overly sensitive to our high - mass stellar sample , among which our detection sensitivity is lower due to the shorter time baseline and fewer doppler measurements per star .",
    "it is likely that this smaller @xmath80 from our analysis of the sun - like stars compared to that of fv05 is in part due to the different methods of fitting the planet - fraction relationship , i.e. their least - squares fit to histogram bins versus our bayesian approach minimization , which assumes symmetric ( @xmath91 ) error bars on their histogram bins . however , the errors should have been binomial and asymmetric , which would have admitted smaller values of @xmath80 . ] .",
    "the other key difference is that we simultaneously fit to both mass and metallicity .",
    "since mass and metallicity are correlated in our samples some of the metallicity relationship observed by fv05 was due to stellar mass .",
    "this effect can also be seen in figure  [ fig : modelfit ] .",
    "the joint mass - metallicity relationship sits above the metallicity power - law at high values of [ fe / h ] since the metal - rich stars in our sample tend to be slightly more massive on average than the metal - poor stars .",

    "one obtains the evidence , or total probability of the model conditioned on the data :    @xmath94    the ratio of evidences provides a means of quantifying preference in one model over another .",
    "if a model has evidence more than a factor of 10 greater than the alternative , it is `` strongly preferred '' @xcite . when fitting planet  fraction as a function of metallicity alone , the evidence for the exponential - only model is a factor of 1800 higher than the exponential - plus - constant . _",
    "thus , our data strongly prefer a model in which the fraction of stars with planets continues to decrease for [ fe / h ]  @xmath95 .",
    "_    we can take the bayesian evidence analysis a step further and compare our joint fit to the planet fraction as a function of mass and metallicity to previous fits to metallicity or mass alone .",
    "we find that the evidence for the joint fit is a factor of 2400 larger than that of the metallicity - only fit , and a factor of @xmath96 higher than a mass - only fit .",
    "the planet fraction among our sample is therefore best described as a function of metallicity _ and _ stellar mass .",
    "@xcite used roughly the same sample presented herein to measure the occurrence rate of planets in three coarse mass bins with widths of 0.6  centered on @xmath97  . in these three intervals",
    "they measured occurrence rates of @xmath98% , @xmath99% and @xmath100% . after correcting for the average stellar metallicity in each bin , the fractions change slightly to @xmath101% , @xmath102 , and a lower limit of 6.3% for the high - mass bin .",
    "integrating our relationship over the same mass intervals yields @xmath103% , @xmath104% , and @xmath105% .",
    "the agreement for the low - mass bin is not too surprising since we are using the same sample of m dwarfs as used by johnson et al .",
    "the disagreement for the fgk dwarfs is in part due to the different selection criteria for planet detections : we use a velocity amplitude cutoff of @xmath30  , compared to the  @xmath106  used by johnson et al .",
    "because of this , our sample of planet detections includes a larger number of low - mass planets at short orbital periods , particularly for the sun - like stellar sample . at higher stellar masses ,",
    "our measured planet fraction represents a significant refinement over the result of johnson et al .",
    ", which stems primarily from our larger sample size and higher doppler precision with keck / hires compared to lick / hamilton .",
    "our revised planet fraction for the high - mass stars appears much smaller than the recent results presented by @xcite , who measured @xmath107% for @xmath108 , based on the lick subgiants sample .",
    "however , bowler et al . reported the bulk occurrence rate , and did not attempt to correct or fit for metallicity .",
    "our analysis shows that metallicity plays an important role in shaping the bulk occurrence rate among our subgiants , which are metal - rich by @xmath109  dex compared to the less massive stars .",
    "this can be seen in the highest mass bin in figure  [ fig : modelfit ] , in which the measured planet fraction is consistent with the value measured by bowler et al .",
    "similarly , in their analysis of the planet fraction for m dwarfs @xcite noted the higher occurrence for metal - rich m dwarfs , but only reported a bulk occurrence rate for the sample .",
    "in their analysis of the metallicity distribution of k giants with planets , @xcite concluded there was no evidence of a pmc among their evolved stars .",
    "@xcite found a similar result based on their sample of massive k giants , while @xcite did find evidence supporting a pmc among their stellar sample .",
    "this somewhat contentious point has important implications for the interpretation of the pmc seen among sun - like stars .",
    "pasquini et al . argued that this lack of a metallicity correlation was evidence for the `` pollution '' scenario , in which only the outer layers of stars with planets were metal - enriched by the infall of gas - depleted planetesimals during the planet - formation epoch @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "as stars evolve off of the main sequence their convective envelopes deepen and their polluted outer layers are diluted , erasing any `` skin - deep '' metallicity enhancement @xcite .    in our analysis , we implicitly assume that the pmc holds among the evolved stars in our sample .",
    "we can test this assumption by restricting our analysis to @xmath110  and comparing the bayesian evidence between two models : planet fraction as a function of stellar mass alone , @xmath111 ( corresponding to a flat metallicity distribution ) versus planet fraction as a function of stellar mass and metallicity , @xmath112 , given by equation  [ eqn : model ] .",
    "we fitted both models to the subsample of massive subgiants , which have deep convective envelopes according to the padova stellar model grids @xcite . we find that the planet fraction among these evolved stars is best described as a function of mass and metallicity , with an evidence ratio of order @xmath113 .",
    "the extreme magnitude of the bayes factor is driven primarily by the 7 subgiants with @xmath110  and [ fe / h ]  @xmath114 ( figure  [ fig : massmet ] ) .",
    "it is highly improbable that a flat metallicity distribution would result in 5 out of 7 of these metal - rich subgiants harboring a planet .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which are lower than , yet consistent with the values we measure for the full stellar sample .",
    "however , the size and metallicity range of our sample of subgiants only allows us to rule out a flat metallicity relationship with 98% confidence .",
    "_ at present we can say that our data are consistent with a pmc among our massive subgiants .",
    "_    we are not certain about the source of disagreement between our result and those of pasquini et al . and",
    "takeda et al .",
    "one possibility is the difference in our statistical methodologies . both of those previous studies compared the histograms of stars with and without planets , and as a result did not quantify their confidence in a pmc or lack thereof .",
    "it will be informative to apply the techniques outlined in   [ fraction ] to the stellar and planet samples of the various k - giant surveys in order to make a meaningful comparison with our results .",
    "we have used a large sample of planet - search target stars and planet detections from the cps to study the correlation between stellar properties and the occurrence of giant planets ( @xmath30  ) with @xmath1172.5  au .",
    "we have derived an empirical relationship describing giant planet occurrence as a function of stellar mass and metallicity , given by      our understanding of planet formation is presently dominated by two theories : core accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and disk instability @xcite .",
    "the core accretion model is a bottom - up process , by which protoplanetary cores are built up by the collisions of smaller planetesimals . once the core reaches a critical mass of roughly 10  @xmath119 , it rapidly accretes gas from the surrounding disk material .",
    "the disk instability mechanism is a top - down process whereby giant planets form from the gravitational collapse of an unstable portion of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "both models depend on the existence of a massive gas disk , a portion of which forms the bulk of the final mass of the jupiter - like planet .",
    "however , since the inner gas disks of protoplanetary disks disperse on timescales of 3 - 5  myr , the process of planet formation is a race against time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this race",
    "the disk instability model holds a major advantage over the core accretion model because , under the right conditions , planets can form from disk collapse in a mere thousands of years , compared to of order myr timescales required for core accretion .",
    "the disk instability model predicts that there should be no dependence on planet formation and physical stellar properties .",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that giant planets should readily form in even low - mass protoplanetary disks , and that in general giant planets should form efficiently via disk instability independent of stellar mass .",
    "the disk instability model also predicts that planet formation should also be independent of disk metallicity @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite show that the efficiency of disk instability to form giant planets _",
    "decreases _ with increasing metallicity .",
    "in contrast to these predictions of the disk instability model , we observe a strong dependence between planet occurrence and the physical properties of the star . assuming that the present - day mass and metallicity of a star reflects the conditions in its protoplanetary disk ,",
    "then our results suggest that disk instability is not the primary formation mechanism for the giant planets detected by doppler surveys .",
    "indeed , it has long been recognized in that there are theoretical complications in forming close - in planets via disk instability ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , the mechanism may be responsible for planets in wide orbits @xcite , however see @xcite for complications with this scenario .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed planet - metallicity correlation is the so - called `` pollution '' model . in this scenario ,",
    "planet formation actually occurs around stars of all metallicities , and the accretion of gas - depleted protoplanets onto the thin convective layers of stars gives rise to an enhanced stellar metallicity that is actually only `` skin deep '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted the flat metallicity distribution of k giants with planets as evidence for such an effect , since the deepening convective envelopes of evolved stars should dilute any metallicity enhancement of its outer layers .",
    "however , we find that the planet fraction among our massive subgiants is described well by a model with a monotonic rise as a function of both mass and metallicity ( section  [ comparison ] ) .    while much attention has been given to evolved , intermediate - mass stars in the investigation of the pollution paradigm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fv05 ) , stars at the other end of the stellar mass scale provide another proving ground .",
    "m dwarfs have deep convective envelopes over their entire lifetimes , and stars with masses below 0.4  are expected to be completely convective , at least in the absence of strong magnetic activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the evidence for a pmc among the subgiants , together with a strong pmc seen among the m dwarfs , are highly suggestive that the present - day metallicities of stars are representative of the compositions of their disks during the planet - formation era . one compelling explanation for both the observed pmc and stellar - mass correlation is that the surface density of solids is a key factor in the planet formation process @xcite .",
    "if so , both higher stellar ( disk ) metallicity and higher stellar ( disk ) mass can generate the requisite surface density for planet formation .",
    "the relationship between planet formation efficiency and stellar mass / metallicity has been previously studied in the context the core accretion paradigm @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the evolution of the temperature profile at the disk midplanes of stars of various masses , and studied the width of the radial region of disks in which protoplanetary cores form most efficiently .",
    "they found that the disks around a - type stars on their descent to the main sequence have very broad formation regions , and their models predicted a positive correlation between stellar mass and giant planet formation efficiency .",
    "their prediction for the planet fraction is shown as a dashed line in figure  [ fig : modelfit ] , which we have approximated using the polynomial relationship @xmath120 .",
    "the agreement between theory and observation is striking .",
    "the interplay between the mass and metallicity of protoplanetary disks is also apparent in the core accretion simulations of @xcite . in their analysis , they simulated disks with a wide variety of masses , viscosities and metallicities .",
    "their models produce gas giants most effectively in disks with a combination of high masses ( @xmath121  ) and low viscosities . in their simulations of the effects of metallicity",
    ", they found that gas giants can form in solar - composition disks only if the disk masses exceed @xmath122  , or twice the minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "this mass threshold decreases to @xmath123  for disks with [ fe / h ]  @xmath124 .",
    "thus , thommes et al",
    ". showed that there can be a trade - off between the mass and metallicity of a protoplanetary disk in forming giant planets . in the core accretion paradigm ,",
    "m dwarfs can form giant planets , but only if they have high metallicities . similarly ,",
    "even low - metallicity a stars can form massive planets , owing to their more massive disks ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "theories of planet formation have progressed in large leaps thanks largely to the rapidly growing sample of exoplanets discovered around other stars .",
    "successful , generalized theories of the origins of planetary systems must account for the observed correlations between planet occurrence and stellar properties .",
    "the findings presented herein are the result of more than 15 years of high - precision doppler monitoring of nearby stars .",
    "additional information will soon pour in from other surveys using techniques such as microlensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , astrometry @xcite , transits @xcite and direct imaging @xcite .",
    "our results have important implications for the target selection of these future planet surveys .",
    "we find that a - type stars harbor planets at an elevated rate compared to less massive stars .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether a type stars make the most promising targets for other types of surveys . where massive stars perhaps hold the most promise is for direct imaging surveys . the first two planetary systems imaged around normal stars were both young a - type dwarfs @xcite .",
    "are a dwarfs the ideal direct imaging targets ?",
    "the answer to this question will rely on the results presented herein , along with a careful consideration of the mass , metallicity , luminosity and age distributions of nearby stars ; and the orbital and physical properties of planets as a function of stellar mass .",
