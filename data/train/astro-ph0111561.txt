    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) are mysterious objects .",
    "we do not understand the energy source that is responsible for their x - ray emission ; unlike young crab - like pulsars their spin - down energy is insufficient and unlike binary x - ray pulsars there is no sign of binary companions from which they could accrete . in the two models most often considered axp are either isolated neutron stars accreting from a fossil disk , formed out of supernova debris ( e.g. chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) or after a common envelope phase ( van paradijs , taam & van den heuvel 1995 ) , or magnetars , neutron stars with an ultrahigh magnetic field ( @xmath0gauss , thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",

    "we found its brightness to be constant to within 0.2 mag ( @xmath4 ) in r and its proper motion to be less than 0.03 arcsec per year ( again @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have extended our data set of 4u  0142 + 61 with photometry in the optical b band and the near - infrared k band . the source is brighter than expected in k ( @xmath5 , fig .  1 ) , but it is not detected in the b band .",
    "none of the currently available models can explain the observed optical emission ( fig .",
