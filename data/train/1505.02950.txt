    "the long term evolution ( lte ) mobile communication standard has been developed by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) in order to enhance the performance of currently deployed 3 g systems in terms of data throughput , spectrum utilization and user mobility @xcite . this technology  supports various channel bandwidths ranging from 1.4 to 20 mhz and promises peak data rates of 100 mbit / s in the downlink ( dl ) and 50 mbit / s in the uplink ( ul ) for the 20 mhz system bandwidth @xcite .",
    "improved resilience against multipath distortion , high spectral efficiency and ability to handle different data rates are achieved by using orthogonal frequency - division multiple - access ( ofdma ) in the dl , while single - carrier frequency - division multiple - access ( sc - fdma ) is adopted in the ul due to its reduced peak - to - average power - ratio @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of choosing between normal and extended cyclic prefix ( cp ) , the latter being considered for large delay spread environments .",
    "lte supports multi - cell communications , with cell information being conveyed by an integer number called cell - id . upon entering the network or during an handover operation ,",
    "the user equipment ( ue ) must recover the cell - id of the serving base station ( enodeb ) and has also to acquire correct timing and frequency synchronization .",
    "this operation is known as initial _ cell - search _",
    "@xcite , @xcite and is accomplished by exploiting a dedicated synchronization channel ( sch ) periodically inserted in the dl radio frame @xcite .",
    "the sch conveys two signals called primary synchronization sequence ( pss ) and secondary synchronization sequence ( sss ) .",
    "the former is generated from a 63-length frequency - domain zafoff - chu ( zc ) sequence whose root index univocally determines the sector identity .",
    "the latter is an interleaved concatenation of two length-31 scrambled _",
    "m_-sequences specifying the cell i d group .",
    "although in principle it is possible to consider the joint estimation of all synchronization parameters and cell - id , a more pragmatic approach relies on the following three - stage procedure @xcite :    1 .",
    "firstly , fractional frequency offset ( ffo ) and coarse symbol timing recovery is accomplished using the redundancy introduced by the cp .",
    "this method was originally proposed in @xcite and its accuracy can be improved by averaging the timing and frequency metrics over several ofdm symbols ; 2 .   in the second step",
    ", the ue detects the position of the pss within the received dl signal in order to acquire subframe timing information , and also determines the sector index by identifying which primary sequence has been transmitted out of three possible alternatives .",
    "the integer frequency offset ( ifo ) can be retrieved at this stage by evaluating the shift of the received pss in the frequency domain ; 3 .",
    "the final step recovers the cell i d group and identifies the frame boundary by using the received sss .",
    "once these operations have been completed , the ue is able to read some basic configuration information broadcast from the enodeb , such as the system bandwidth , cp length and duplexing mode .",
    "since sss detection can be accomplished only after successful identification of the primary sequence , pss detection represents a crucial task in the overall cell search procedure . for this reason ,",
    "it has attracted much attention in the last few years and many solutions are currently available .",
    "some of them operate in the time - domain ( td ) , while others exploit the frequency - domain ( fd ) samples provided by the receive discrete fourier transform ( dft ) unit . examples of td schemes can be found in @xcite-@xcite , where the pss is revealed by looking for the peak of the cross - correlation between the received samples and the three locally regenerated zc sequences .",
    "however , since the sch is transmitted onto a set of 62 dedicated subcarriers with the other subcarriers being modulated by data symbols , the pss should be extracted from the dl signal before the correlation stage .",
    "this requires a high - order filtering operation of the received signal , which results into an increase of the hardware complexity and also leads to some performance degradation since the contribution of data subcarriers can not be totally filtered out due to the spectral leakage and the uncompensated cfo .",
    "td methods with reduced complexity are suggested in @xcite and @xcite , where the tasks of pss detection and sector index recovery are decoupled by either exploiting the central symmetric - property of the zc sequences or by correlating the dl signal with the sum of the three possible primary sequences .    as an alternative to the td  approach , in fd schemes the contribution of the data - bearing subcarriers",
    "is eliminated by selecting the sch at the receive dft output and correlating the resulting samples with replicas of the three tentative frequency - domain zc sequences @xcite .",
    "this method works properly as long as the channel gain can be considered as approximately constant over the sch subband .",
    "unfortunately , such an assumption does not hold for transmissions over severe multipath channels or in the presence of a non - negligible timing error , which appears as a linearly increasing phase shift at the dft output . in these circumstances",
    ", the correlation properties of the received pss will be irreparably destroyed with an ensuing degradation of the system performance . to solve this problem , differential correlation in the fd has been proposed in @xcite , where ifo detection is also accomplished during the pss match process .",
    "a disadvantage of the differential approach is that the peaks of the resulting metric are quite close for different ifo values , thereby reducing its ability to recover the frequency error @xcite .",
    "furthermore , compared to @xcite , the accuracy of the fd differential correlator is greatly reduced whenever the channel frequency response ( cfr ) over the sch is approximately constant . for this reason ,",
    "the authors of @xcite propose to adaptively choose between non - differential and differential detection on the basis of a previous estimate of the maximum channel delay spread .",
    "a simpler solution is found in @xcite by resorting to the partial correlation concept , wherein the received sch is partitioned into several adjacent fd segments which are subsequently correlated with the corresponding parts of the tentative zc sequences .",
    "a fundamental design parameter of this approach is represented by the number of segments , which must be selected in accordance with the coherence bandwidth of the transmission channel .",
    "it is worth noting that all the aforementioned methods have been derived by means of heuristic reasoning . in order to check whether their performance can be substantially improved or not , it is of interest to make comparisons with alternative approaches based on some optimality criterion . with this goal in mind , in the present work we employ maximum likelihood ( ml ) methods to study the problem of pss detection , sector index identification and ifo recovery , which represents the second step of the cell search process in an lte system .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations , our analysis , which originates from the work presented in @xcite , explicitly takes into account the multipath distortion introduced by the propagation medium on the received signal .",
    "this is achieved by treating the cfr over the sch subcarriers as a nuisance vector @xcite , which is jointly estimated along with the synchronization parameters .",
    "as we shall see , this approach may lead to an under - determined estimation problem wherein the number of quantities to be recovered exceeds the number of available data .",
    "reduced - rank approximations of the cfr are proposed to cope with such a situation using either the minimum mean square - error criterion ( mmse ) or the classical polynomial basis expansion .",
    "this approach results into a general framework which includes both the conventional fd scheme @xcite and the partial correlation concept @xcite through a suitable selection of the cfr model .",
    "a key assumption of our analysis is that symbol timing and ffo have been previously acquired using the classical cp - based method presented in @xcite .",
    "however , since multipath propagation may significantly reduce the accuracy of the timing estimates provided by @xcite , a residual timing error is included in the adopted system model and numerical simulations are used to assess its impact on the overall performance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section illustrates the signal model and formulates the estimation problem .",
    "iii presents the joint ml estimator of the unknown parameters using a generic expansion basis to represent the cfr .",
    "an mmse reduced - rank approximation of the cfr is derived in sect .",
    "iv along with other possible channel representations that lead to alternative known pss detection schemes . after discussing numerical simulations in sect .",
    "v , we offer some conclusions in sect .",

    "the notation @xmath5 indicates the norm of the enclosed vector , while @xmath6 and tr@xmath7 are the inverse and the trace of a matrix @xmath8 .",
    "we use e@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for expectation , complex conjugation , transposition and hermitian transposition , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath13e@xmath14 stands for the real part of a complex - valued quantity , while @xmath15 represents the corresponding modulus .",
    "finally , we use @xmath16 to indicate a trial value of an unknown parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we consider the dl of an lte system operating in frequency - division - duplexing ( fdd ) mode . as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "data transmission is organized in radio frame units of length 10 ms .",
    "each frame is divided into ten 1 ms subframes , which are further partitioned into two slots of length 0.5 ms .",
    "every slot contains 7 ofdma symbols in case of normal cp , while 6 ofdma symbols are present when the extended cp is employed to cope with a large delay spread . in the time - frequency grid ,",
    "system resources are divided into resource blocks ( rbs ) , such that each rb is composed of 12 contiguous subcarriers for a duration of one slot .        according to the lte specifications , 504 different physical - layer cell ids are available and arranged into 168 distinct groups .",
    "each group is identified by the cell i d group @xmath18 and contains three different sectors , which are specified by the sector i d @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to acquiring the correct timing and frequency synchronization , during the cell search procedure the ue must retrieve the integer - valued parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , from which the cell i d of the serving enodeb is uniquely computed as @xmath22 . to accomplish these tasks , two synchronization sequences called pss and sss",
    "are periodically transmitted on a dedicated sch to specify the sector i d and cell group , respectively .",
    "in particular , the pss is located in the last ofdm symbol of the first and 11th slots of each radio frame , while the sss is transmitted in the symbol immediately preceding the pss . as lte allows for various system bandwidths ,",
    "both pss and sss are mapped onto a 73-subcarriers subband located symmetrically around dc , which corresponds to the smallest allowable spectrum occupancy .",
    "such design choice enables the detection of the synchronization signals without requiring explicit knowledge of the system bandwidth .",
    "the pss is chosen in a set of three different 63-length zc sequences characterized by excellent auto- and cross - correlation properties @xcite .",
    "more precisely , during the pss transmission the sch subcarriers with indices @xmath23 are modulated by the following polyphase complex exponential terms @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the root index of the selected zc sequence and @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the above equation indicates that , out of the 73 available subcarriers , only 62 are modulated by the pss , while the remaining eleven ( five placed at the sch boundaries and one placed at dc ) are left unfilled .",
    "the root index belongs to the set @xmath28 and specifies the sector i d @xmath21 as shown in table [ tab : zcroots ] .",
    ".relationship between @xmath21 and zc roots [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "computer simulations have been run to assess the performance of the presented pss detection and ifo recovery schemes using different reduced - rank representations of the cfr .",
    "the lte simulation set - up is chosen according to the 3gpp specifications @xcite and is summarized as follows .",
    "we consider a 20 mhz lte communication system with 15 khz subcarrier spacing . at the receiver side ,",
    "the baseband signal is sampled with frequency @xmath29 mhz and converted in the frequency - domain through a 2048-point dft unit . to demonstrate the capability of the investigated scheme in a challenging scenario , we adopt the extended typical urban ( etu ) channel model characterized by 9 channel taps with maximum excess delay @xmath30 @xmath31s .",
    "the path gains are modeled as statistically independent random variables with zero - mean and gaussian distribution ( rayleigh fading ) .",
    "a raised - cosine functions with roll - off 0.22 and time - duration of 6 sampling periods is employed for the pulse shaping , which corresponds to an overall cir of order @xmath32int@xmath33 . assuming a maximum normalized timing error @xmath34 @xcite , the length of the equivalent cir vector @xmath35 is found to be @xmath36 . however , since parameter @xmath37 ( and the system complexity ) is expected to increase with the cir  duration , in the design of the ammse we use @xmath38 , which amounts to reducing the size of matrix @xmath39 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that in the etu channel model there is only one multipath component with a path delay greater than @xmath42 @xmath31s which , moreover , collects less than 3% of the average channel power .",
    "the value @xmath38 is also compliant with other lte channel models , such as the extended vehicular a ( eva ) and extended pedestrian a ( epa ) , which are characterized by a maximum excess delay of @xmath43 @xmath31s and @xmath44 @xmath31s , respectively .    without any loss of generality",
    ", we adopt the extended cp transmission mode wherein 6 ofdm symbols are present in each slot .",
    "since the pss is transmitted every 10 slots , in our simulations we let @xmath45 .",
    "the range of cfo values is related to the oscillator instability , while it is only marginally affected by the ue mobility .",
    "hence , assuming that the stability of commercial oscillators for mobile applications is in the order of @xmath46 parts - per - million ( ppm ) at both the transmit and receive ends , the maximum cfo value is approximately @xmath47 subcarrier spacing at the carrier frequency of 2 ghz .",
    "accordingly , the search range for the ifo is @xmath48 , which amounts to putting @xmath49 . recalling that the pss is chosen from a set of three possible zc sequences with root index @xmath50 , the overall search space for the triplet @xmath51 $ ] has cardinality @xmath52 .",
    "the accuracy of the pss detection and ifo recovery schemes is measured in terms of the error rate incurred in the estimation of each parameter of interest @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as a global performance indicator",
    ", we also consider the overall probability of failure @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the quantity mse@xmath56 reported in ( [ eq20 ] ) as a function of @xmath37 for the investigated reduced - rank cfr representations .",
    "as expected , the best results are obtained with @xmath57 since this choice minimizes mse@xmath56 for a fixed value of @xmath37 .",
    "compared to the true mmse solution , the ammse is characterized by a higher mse , even though it largely outperforms both the prr and pcrr schemes .",
    "although the accuracy of the considered reduced - rank representations steadily improves with @xmath37 , the probability of failure @xmath58 can not exhibit a similar behaviour .",
    "the reason is that @xmath8 has dimension @xmath59 and , accordingly , it becomes a square matrix when @xmath60 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath61 reduces to @xmath62 and @xmath63 is therefore the null matrix .",
    "this situation has two consequences .",
    "on one hand , from ( [ eq20 ] ) we see that mse@xmath64 , thereby justifying the fact that the mse decreases as @xmath37 approaches the value 63 . on the other hand ,",
    "substituting @xmath65 into ( [ eq13 ] ) leads to @xmath66 or , equivalently , @xmath67 this equation indicates that the metric @xmath68 becomes independent of @xmath69 when @xmath60 , thereby preventing any possibility to recover the sector index . from the above discussion",
    "it follows that parameter @xmath37 must be judiciously designed so as to meet two conflicting requirements . on one hand",
    ", it must be large enough to produce a sufficiently accurate reduced - rank representation of the cfr .",
    "on the other hand , it must be adequately small since otherwise the estimation problem contains too many unknown quantities which can not be estimated reliably .",
    "this intuition is corroborated by the results of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where @xmath58 is shown as a function of @xmath37 . here",
    ", the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is fixed at 8 db and the timing error is @xmath70 . as is seen , for each curve",
    "there is an optimum value of @xmath37 which minimizes @xmath58 .",
    "since the minimum is approximately attained at @xmath71 by all the considered reduced - rank representations , such a value is used in the subsequent simulations except for the cfdc scheme , which is obtained from the pcrr by letting @xmath72 .     for @xmath73",
    "db and @xmath74.,width=321 ]    fig .  [ fig4 ] illustrates the error rate incurred in detecting the presence of the pss , say @xmath75 , vs. the snr for @xmath76 .",
    "in addition to the investigated schemes , we also consider the pss differential detector ( dd ) proposed in @xcite , which provides an estimate of the unknown parameters @xmath77 $ ] by looking for the maximum of the following metric @xmath78 in which the quantities @xmath79 and @xmath80 obtained from two adjacent frequency bins are multiplied in order to mitigate the impact of the timing error and channel selectivity on the system performance . as expected , ammse outperforms all the other methods and achieves a gain of approximately 2 db over the dd , which further increases to 2.5 db and 3 db with respect to pcrr and prr , respectively .",
    "due to its high sensitivity to timing errors and channel distortions , the cfdc does not work properly in such adverse scenario , and exhibits an error rate which is close to one at all snr values .",

    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show the error rate incurred in the estimation of the sector index and ifo , respectively , say @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the operating scenario is the same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and also the trend of the curves is similar , with ammse outperforming the other schemes . it is worth noting that the use of ammse is more advantageous for the estimation of the ifo than for the other two parameters @xmath83 and @xmath25 .     vs. snr for @xmath84.,width=321 ]     vs. snr for @xmath84.,width=321 ]    the overall system performance is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where @xmath58 is shown as a function of the snr with the timing error being fixed to @xmath85 .",
    "these measurements validate the results of figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] and clearly indicate the superiority of ammse over the other methods . in particular , at snr=10",
    "db we see that the probability of failure  of ammse is @xmath86 , while it increases to @xmath87 with pcrr , prr and dd .",
    ".,width=321 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] illustrates @xmath58 as a function of @xmath88 when the snr is fixed to 8 db .",
    "these results are useful to assess the sensitivity of the considered schemes to residual timing errors and demonstrate the remarkable robustness of both dd and ammse to such an impairment .",
    "in contrast , the probability of failure of pcrr , prr and cfdc rapidly deteriorates as @xmath89 increases .",
    "this is particularly evident for the cfdc , which can not be used when the timing error exceeds a few sampling periods .     for @xmath73 db.,width=321 ]",
    "we conclude our study by comparing the investigated schemes in terms of their computational complexity . from the results reported in table [ tab : complexity ]",
    "it turns out that , in the considered scenario with @xmath49 and @xmath71 , the number of required kiloflops ( kflops ) for each received ofdm  symbol is approximately @xmath90 for the ammse method , @xmath91 for prr and @xmath92 for both pcrr and cfdc . as for the dd scheme ,",
    "computing the numerator of @xmath93 in ( [ eq35 ] ) starting from @xmath94 needs 245 flops for each couple @xmath95 which , after including the computational burden required to get the quantities @xmath96 and @xmath94 , leads to an overall processing requirement of @xmath97 kflops .",
    "these figures indicate that the improved accuracy of the ammse is achieved at the price of a higher system complexity .",
    "in particular , the number of flops is increased by a factor of two with respect to pcrr , and by a factor 5.5 with respect to the other methods . however , considering the fact that in the investigated simulation set - up the ammse is the only scheme that can ensure acceptable error rate performance , the penalty in terms of computational load seems tolerable .",
    "we have presented an ml approach for joint pss detection , sector index identification and ifo recovery in the downlink of an lte system .",
    "the proposed scheme ( ammse ) operates in the frequency - domain and is based on a novel mmse reduced - rank representation of the channel frequency response over the sch subcarriers , which mitigates the impact of multipath distortions and residual timing errors on the system performance .",
    "compared to existing schemes available in the literature , our method exhibits improved accuracy at the price of a higher computational complexity . the penalty in terms of required flops",
    "is justified by the fact that ammse can be used in a harsh environment characterized by prolonged delay spreads and non - negligible timing errors , where other competing schemes provide unacceptable performance .",
    "furthermore , it represents a promising candidate for future heterogeneous networks in which the coexistence of femto- , pico- and macro - cells will require fast and successful detection of neighboring cells for efficient interference management and fast handover operations .      3gpp ts 36.101 v8.9.0 3rd generation partnership project ; technical specification group radio access network ; evolved universal terrestrial radio access ( e - utra ) ; user equipment ( ue ) radio transmission and reception ( release 8) , techn .",
