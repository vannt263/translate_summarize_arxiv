    "cms ( compact muon solenoid ) is a general purpose experiment under construction at cern .",
    "the description of the apparatus is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "cms will be built on lhc ( large hadron collider ) a @xmath4 collider with @xmath5=14 tev and a maximum luminosity of @xmath6 @xcite  .",
    "one of the main physics topics of the collaboration will be the study of the b hadron physics .",
    "in fact apart from the interest `` per se '' of this topic , b - jets are also the main background for several other physics channels  @xcite , @xcite . in this article ,",
    "i present a study on @xmath1 production mechanisms at lhc energies using the monte carlo package  @xcite as event generator .",
    "+ at a hadron collider @xmath1 pairs are produced by the following mechanisms :    1 .   * pair production * ( gluon or quark fusion ) : @xmath7 , @xmath8 . for each event",
    "a @xmath1 pair is produced in the hard interaction .",
    "* flavour excitation * : @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "a heavy flavour from the parton distribution of one beam particle is put on mass shell by scattering against a parton of the other beam .",
    "as @xmath11 quark is not a valence flavour it must come from a branching @xmath12 .",
    "* gluon splitting * : @xmath12 .",
    "it occurs in the initial- or final - state shower but no heavy flavours are produced in the hard scattering .",
    "a more detailed definition of the mechanisms can be found in ref  @xcite .",
    "as these mechanisms give rise to different kinematic configurations of the final state is important to understand their contribution to the total cross section .",
    "+ the only way to generate ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) in  is using the steering card msel=1 , which generates qcd @xmath13 events . in order to have higher statistics , and save computation time",
    "the user can set kinematic cuts at generation level which limits the available portion of phase space  @xcite , increasing the efficiency of selection cuts .",
    "one of this cuts is the @xmath14 cutoff .",
    "is defined as the transverse momentum of the outgoing partons in the center of mass system of the ingoing partons . ]",
    "+ in the following sections i will show differences between the use of the  default cutoff ( 1 gev ) and a 10 gev cutoff .",
    "three versions of the generator have been considered : 5.75 , 6.115 and 6.152 which has been chosen as event generator for the next cms physics studies .",
    "two samples have been prepared with the three versions of   to investigate the influence of the @xmath14 cutoff on the production of @xmath1 events . both of them have been generated using msel=1 and contain events with only one @xmath1 pair .",
    "the first sample ( sample  a ) has been generated with the default @xmath14 cutoff ( 1 gev ) .",
    "the second sample ( sample b ) has been generated with @xmath15 gev .",
    "for both samples the @xmath1 production cross section for @xmath15  gev has been computed using the following formula : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of @xmath1 events with @xmath18 10 gev , @xmath19 is the total number of events generated and @xmath20 is the total ( qcd @xmath13 ) cross section given by  .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     all double countings have been avoided requiring the number of b - quarks coming from the hard interaction to be 2 ( pair production ) , 1 ( flavour excitation ) or 0 ( gluon splitting ) . as it appears clear from the table for version 5.75 and 6.115 the cross section is @xmath14 dependent .",
    "the problem is related to flavour excitation which in this two versions can not be generated with default @xmath14 cutoff ( sample a ) .",
    "the difference in the @xmath21 ( for sample a ) between 5.75 and 6.115 is due to the different choice of the default parton distribution function .",
    "the interpretation of the observed phenomena , given by t.  sjstrand and e.  norrbin , is reported in @xcite . in version 6.152",
    "the problem related to flavour excitation has been set but there is still a difference of about 10% between the cross sections of the two samples ( for all versions statistical errors can be neglected ) . + the difference in the value of cross sections is not very important , because the results are usually normalized to the total @xmath1 cross section of 500  @xmath22b . on the other hand , the different contributions for the production mechanisms could be more dangerous , as they can lead to different kinematic distributions , and therefore affect the efficiencies for different selections .",
    "[ fig : cross ] illustrates the difference in the @xmath1 production cross sections due to the additional contribution of the flavour excitation mechanism in sample  b. +",
    "the main kinematic parameters which define the signature of @xmath1 event are the transverse momenta and pseudorapidities of the @xmath11 quarks , and the angular distance @xmath23 between their directions in the transverse plane .",
    "the first two parameters have similar distributions in both samples . the @xmath23 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] for the three different mechanisms .    for what concerns",
    "gluon splitting , the distribution is slightly peaked at small @xmath23 .",
    "the angle between the two @xmath11-quarks produced by the gluon - fusion mechanism has a peak at @xmath24 , as expected , since in the process @xmath7 the b - quarks are produced back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "the last distribution corresponds to the flavour excitation production mechanism , for which the back - to - back topology is preferred .",
    "we can conclude that the total @xmath25 distributions of sample a and sample b are slightly different .",
    "some care should be taken about this , as it could affect the estimated efficiency of selection cuts .",
    "versions 5.75 and 6.115 show a big discrepancy in the total @xmath1 production cross section when using two different cutoffs on @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is due to flavour excitation which can be generated only in sample b but gluon splitting and pair production are stable and show the same cross section in the two samples . in both versions the use of a different @xmath0 .",
    "cutoff from the default one leads to slightly different @xmath26 distributions caused by the presence of flavour excitation .",
    "+ in version 6.152 everything is set , a part a little inconsistency of about 10% on which i am working in order to understand the cause .",
