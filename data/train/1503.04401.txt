    "<S> we study the significance and characteristics of interfacial dynamical charge transfer at metal - organic interfaces for the organic semiconductor model system 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ntcda ) on ag(111 ) quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> we combine infrared absorption spectroscopy and dispersion - corrected density functional theory calculations to analyze dynamic dipole moments and electron - vibron coupling at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that interfacial dynamical charge transfer is the dominant cause of infrared activity in these systems and that it correlates with results from partial charge and density of states analysis . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear motion generates an additional dynamic dipole moment but represents a minor effect except for modes with significant out - of - plane amplitudes .        </S>",
    "<S> metal - organic interfaces are essential elements influencing the performance of molecular electronics applications like light - emitting devices or field - effect transistors . here , electronic excitations via charge - transfer excitons often play a key role </S>",
    "<S> . the formation mechanisms of these excitons via electron - hole pair ( ehp ) formation at the interface thus need to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of ehp to adsorbate vibrations ( electron - vibron coupling ) is one way to induce an interfacial dynamical charge transfer ( idct ) , which delivers key information about the electronic structure at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> idct induced by an orbital dipping in and out of the fermi sea has been suggested for small molecules on metal surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been applied to larger organic adsorbates on metal surfaces more recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of such coupling on the vibrational line shape was analyzed by langreth @xcite . despite its importance , there is no theoretical or experimental proof for idct as such and the relative importance compared to nuclear motion at a metal - organic interface beyond heuristic models up to now . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify this contribution by first - principles analysis and provide a rationale for the amount of idct for specific vibrational modes at the interface .    </S>",
    "<S> prerequisites for the occurrence of idct are ( i ) partial occupation of an adsorbate molecular orbital upon adsorption and ( ii ) strong electron - vibron coupling for relevant substrate electronic levels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was met in early studies for co on cu(100 ) @xcite and o@xmath0 on pt(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , idct was observed in studies on fullerene @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> idct , in conjunction with ehp excitation is also held responsible for the strong damping of high frequency vibrations of adsorbates via energy dissipation , which was one of the driving forces for its analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> line - width analysis for ir  measurements then leads to an estimate of vibrational lifetimes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of electron - vibron coupling is essentially a breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation . for systems with strong non - adiabaticity , </S>",
    "<S> idct thus leads to asymmetric line shapes in vibrational spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while a theoretical treatment of this asymmetry requires a time - dependent analysis @xcite , which is not feasible for the system investigated here , an empirical evaluation for ntcda on ag(111 ) has been presented recently by braatz @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will present a microscopic view on the vibrational modes of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ntcda ) on ag(111 ) based on experiment and computation focusing on the contribution of idct to the observed infrared ( ir ) absorption intensities . </S>",
    "<S> we correlate this to results of charge - transfer analysis associated with the electron - vibron coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that idct is the dominating effect for electron - vibron coupling in this system , quantify the charge - transfer associated and verify that idct is crucial for symmetric @xmath2 modes to become ir - active , in stark contrast to the free molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the system chosen here constitutes a model system for a more general class of metal - organic interfaces with noble metal substrates and planar @xmath3-conjugated organic semiconductor species and we expect the results to be transferable to systems with similar energy level matching . </S>",
    "<S> quantification of electron - vibron coupling has been identified as a major challenge for these interfaces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , infrared absorption spectroscopy ( iras ) is the method of choice to extract information regarding idct since it provides accurate vibrational energy and intensity measurements for modes originating at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , iras adheres to strict selection rules and probes molecular layers in a non - destructive way . </S>",
    "<S> the ir intensity of a mode is proportional to the square of the change of dipole moment of this vibration with respect to the equilibrium structure ( dynamic dipole moment ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 results from contributions of nuclear motion ( @xmath6 ) and dynamic charge transfer across the adsorbate - substrate interface ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 as depicted in scheme [ fig : my - dyn]c . </S>",
    "<S> upon adsorption , charge q is being transferred from the surface to the adsorbate . </S>",
    "<S> changes in q along vibrational coordinate q ( dynamic charge transfer @xmath9q ) can be determined by partial charge analysis ; they are proportional to the idct contribution : @xmath10    we will show that the contribution @xmath6 can be derived from equation [ eq : dyn ] , if @xmath7 is the major component . additionally , the contribution from nuclear motion can be estimated directly from @xmath11 where @xmath12 gives the dipole moment change of the adsorbate distorted along q without the presence of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> for an adsorbate on a metal substrate only the z - component of @xmath13 contributes to the intensity due to dipole selection rules . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath14 is determined by out - of - plane displacements of the adsorbate atoms ( scheme [ fig : my - dyn]c ) .        </S>",
    "<S> atomic and electronic ground state structures of metal - organic interfaces are well represented by dispersion - corrected density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the description of vibrational spectra has also successfully been achieved in the past @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ntcda represents a model system with typical properties for an important class of organic semiconductors suitable for metal - organic interfaces : ( i ) highly symmetric planar atomic structure , ( ii ) delocalized @xmath3-electron system , ( iii ) strong binding to metal surfaces with multiple bonding mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the totally symmetric @xmath2 modes are ir - inactive for the free molecule ( @xmath15 ) . according to iras the vibrational spectrum of ntcda on ag(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> is strongly dominated by these in - plane vibrational modes , which suggests a notable contribution to @xmath5 from idct @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> near edge x - ray absorption fine structure measurements showed strong electron - vibron coupling in this system which renders it highly suitable for the quantitative determination of idct @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our computational investigations applied dispersion - corrected dft computations at the gga level ( pbe - d3 ) @xcite as outlined in the computational details section . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - monolayer structure investigated here differs from a genuine relaxed monolayer insofar as the ntcda molecules are separated by one extra ag atom row so that hydrogen bonding between neighbouring adsorbates can be neglected and all ntcda occupy identical adsorption sites . </S>",
    "<S> ntcda preferentially adsorbs with the central c = c bond occupying a bridge position on the ag(111 ) surface as shown in scheme  [ fig : my - dyn]a . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed discussion of structural parameters , which agree well with experimental data of x - ray standing wave measurements,@xcite is presented elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the molecule is bonded by van - der - waals interactions together with direct oxygen - silver chemical bonds ( scheme [ fig : my - dyn]b ) leading to a strong adsorption and thus fulfilling the first prerequisite for idct @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the partial filling of the lumo upon adsorption is a well - known phenomenon for ntcda @xcite and thus the second requirement for idct is also satisfied .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] the experimental and computed ir spectra of ntcda on ag(111 ) are displayed . </S>",
    "<S> the iras spectrum refers to 0.15 monolayers deposited at 28 k. the low temperature ensures that isolated ntcda molecules are present and the formation of denser islands is avoided , in accordance with the arrangement used in our theoretical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to previously derived spectra for the relaxed monolayer of ntcda on ag(111)@xcite yield moderate frequency shifts and only slight intensity variations , most probably due to some minor structural modification as a result of the different local environment . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain very good agreement of experiment and theory for vibrational energies and relative intensities . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can trust the computational spectrum to reproduce all the essential features and base the further examination on these data .     in the computed spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> flags indicate symmetry of respective modes applying free molecule nomenclature.,width=302 ]    the determination of mode symmetry for the vibrations of the adsorbate has been achieved by comparison of the displacement patterns to the free ntcda molecule . </S>",
    "<S> although the molecule bends upon adsorption ( scheme [ fig : my - dyn]b ) and the point group symmetry reduces from @xmath16 to approximately @xmath17 , the respective symmetry labels of modes are maintained as this way of labeling is the most helpful and intuitive one . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] it is apparent that most of the intense ir bands belong to the totally symmetric @xmath2 irreducible representation . </S>",
    "<S> notably , these modes are ir - inactive in the free molecule since they do not exhibit dynamic dipole moments .    </S>",
    "<S> q , orange ) and negative ( es-@xmath9q , light blue ) distortion along mode 13 ( @xmath18 , @xmath2 , top ) and mode 12 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , bottom ) together with the corresponding pdos stemming from @xmath21 states of ntcda . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic displacements have been amplified.,width=302 ]    next , we analyze the contribution of idct to @xmath22 by displacing the adsorbate along normal mode coordinate q. for the most intense mode at @xmath23 ( @xmath2 ) the displacement pattern and the corresponding pdos of the @xmath3-orbitals ( composed of @xmath24 atomic orbitals ) of ntcda are displayed in figure  [ fig : disps ] ( top ) . shown is the pdos for the equilibrium structure ( black line ) together with positively ( orange line ) and negatively ( blue line ) displaced structures . </S>",
    "<S> the partial occupation of the bands stemming from @xmath3-orbitals is unveiled ( fermi level crossing the pdos lines ) , thus reflecting the known partial lumo occupation upon adsorption . </S>",
    "<S> for the displaced structures , we see a strong shift of the pdos maximum and a respective change in density at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , we observe electron - vibron coupling in this system and identify a strong dependence of the electronic structure on the vibrational motion  a direct prove for idct derived from first principles calculations rather than heuristic assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> analogous behavior is observed for the other @xmath2 modes in the adsorbate , albeit at a reduced extent . analyzing a larger entity of modes ( table [ tab : dispdata ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ir - active modes exhibit notable values for @xmath13 as expected from equation [ eq : ir ] . </S>",
    "<S> the high values for @xmath9q for most ir - active modes are a strong indication that idct is the leading effect in the system investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> further support for this hypothesis can be found by analyzing the modes exhibiting different symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> modes 3 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , 5 ( @xmath27 , @xmath26 ) and 15 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) exhibit significant , albeit much lower intensities in the experimental as well as the computed spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , table [ tab : dispdata ] ) in line with their lower @xmath9q values . for the @xmath26-symmetric modes 3 and 5 , </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant out - of - plane bending component as expected from symmetry considerations . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a major contribution to @xmath13 that can be quantified by determining @xmath12 ( scheme [ fig : my - dyn ] ) , which shows that mode 3 has the highest contribution from nuclear motion .    </S>",
    "<S> although we now established qualitative relations between @xmath13 and its contributions from idct and nuclear motion , we aim at a direct relationship to allow the quantitative comparison of both factors . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : corr]a reveals that the charge transfer contribution @xmath9q indeed strongly correlates with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> no correlation is found with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> although correlation does not imply causality , combined with the pdos analysis it becomes clear that idct determines @xmath13 of @xmath2 type of modes and thereby @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 can now be derived from @xmath9q by the linear correlation given in figure [ fig : corr]a under the assumption that it is the leading term ( @xmath31 ) and is given in table [ tab : dispdata ] . from equation [ eq : dyn ] , the signed value for @xmath32 can then readily be determined as the difference of @xmath13 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the sign convention is thus that a negative value indicates @xmath32 pointing in the opposite direction compared to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the good correlation of @xmath32 with the computed @xmath12 in figure [ fig : corr]b validates the approach . </S>",
    "<S> this linear correlation can now be employed to convert @xmath12 values into @xmath33 ( eq . [ eq : nucl ] ) given in table [ tab : dispdata ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus derive @xmath33 directly from @xmath12 or as difference from @xmath30 , while the latter approach gives information regarding the relative sign of the contributions .    for most modes investigated </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath30 to be the leading contribution to @xmath13 ( table [ tab : dispdata ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , for three out of the four modes with highest intensity ( 9 , 10 , 13 ) , idct effects are an order of magnitude larger . </S>",
    "<S> the third - most intense mode 14 ( @xmath34 ) also shows high idct contributions but lower @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by the opposite sign of the strong @xmath32 contribution , which stems from a substantial vibrational amplitude for the downward - bent acyl - oxygen atoms at the periphery of the adsorbate . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , analysis of the displacement patterns unveils a mixed nature for modes 14 and 15 with dominant @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that this mixing of character is provoked by their close spectral vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> this also explains the surprising intensity of mode 15 since @xmath29 symmetry should render it dipole forbidden on a metal surface ( @xmath5 along ntcda long axis ) . </S>",

    "<S> modes with medium intensity ( 6 , 7 , 8) and @xmath2 symmetry exhibit higher relative contributions from nuclear motion but in all cases idct is the leading term here as well , while mode 1 shows equivalent contributions from both mechanisms . modes 3 and 5 ( @xmath26 symmetry ) , exhibit opposite signs for both terms : this leads to a near - zero intensity for mode 5 ( @xmath35 ) and high intensity for mode 3 due to nuclear motion ( @xmath36 ) .

    "<S> thus , although several of these vibrations are ir - active in the free molecule they do not show any intensity on the ag(111 ) substrate due to screening of dipoles parallel to the metal substrate .    </S>",

    "<S> we have investigated electron - vibron coupling effects associated with vibrational excitations at metal - organic interfaces for the model system ntcda on ag(111 ) . using infrared absorption spectroscopy and employing density functional theory based bonding and vibrational analysis we derived unequivocal evidence for the dominating role of interfacial dynamical charge transfer ( idct ) for dynamic dipole moments and associated infrared activities . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear motion ( out - of - plane bending ) is found to be a secondary mechanism only . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of idct for totally symmetric vibrational modes can be understood by pdos shifts and derived from partial charge analysis . </S>",
    "<S> contributions from nuclear motion can be determined reliably if idct is the leading term . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a simple , quantitative measure for the complex phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> our general approach will facilitate the analysis of other relevant metal - organic interfaces with similar matching of energy levels in the future . </S>",
