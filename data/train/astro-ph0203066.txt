    "hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) have been extensively studied during last decades .",
    "much of the interest raised because n - body simulations have shown that members of hcgs should merge and form a single galaxy in a few crossing times ( barnes 1985 , 1989 ; ishizawa 1986 ; mamon 1987 ; zheng , valtonen , & chernin 1993 ) .",
    "more recent n - body simulations of poor groups ( bode et al .",
    "1994 ; athanassoula , makino , & bosma 1997 ) indicated that supposed formation of a central massive galaxy is a sufficiently rapid process .",
    "meanwhile observations do not prove the expected high rate of merging ( zepf 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , it had been mentioned a strange absence of strong radio sources , absence of strong signs of interaction , such as blue colors or fir - emission , the fact that the elliptical members ( best candidates for ongoing mergers ) are not more frequently first - ranked than spirals , etc .",
    "( menon 1995 ; leon , combes , & menon 1998 ; zepf 1993 ; moles et al .",
    "1994 ; fasano & bettoni 1994 ; pildis , bregman & schombert 1995 ; sulentic 1997 ) . to overcome",
    "the contradictions with observations mamon ( 1986 , 1995 ) , suggested that hcgs do not exist as physical entities , and are a result of projection of galaxies in loose groups ( lgs ) . on the other hand , hernquist , katz & weinberg ( 1995 ) , ostriker ,",
    "lubin & hernquist ( 1995 ) suggested that hcgs are filaments seen end - on . contrary to this there have been presented many evidences in favor of the physical reality of hcgs ( hickson 1997 and references therein ) . to conciliate the results of n - body simulations with the facts on the physical reality of hcgs , governato , bhatia & chincarini ( 1991 ) , diaferio , geller & ramella ( 1994 , 1995 ) suggested that cgs are being formed continually in collapsing lgs .",
    "this mechanism , however , does not eliminate the mentioned contradictions .",
    "a clue to the solution of the problem was given by tovmassian , martinez , & tiersch ( 1998 ) .",
    "they showed that the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , of hcgs correlates with the elongation @xmath0 is the angular distance between the most widely separated galaxies in the group , and @xmath2 is the sum of the angular distances @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the most distant galaxies on either side of the line @xmath5 joining the most separated galaxies ( rood 1979 ) . ] .",
    "it was already known that hcgs have a triaxial spheroid configuration with the true mean sphericity @xmath6 ( malykh & orlov 1986 ) .",
    "elongated groups with small @xmath0 have , on average , smaller @xmath1s , while more round groups with high @xmath0 ratio have higher @xmath1s .",
    "this finding showed that hcgs are real physical formations , and that member galaxies in each hcg are moving along its elongation .",
    "if member galaxies are indeed moving along the elongation of a group , then @xmath1s of chain - like groups with small two - dimensional galaxy - galaxy median projected separation @xmath7 ( supposed to be oriented at relatively small angle to the line of sight ) should , on average , be higher than that of groups with higher @xmath7 ( supposed to be oriented almost orthogonal to the line of sight ) .",
    "there are 29 chain - like hcgs with @xmath8 .",
    "the mean @xmath7 of 16 of them with @xmath9 kpc is @xmath10 kpc , and the mean @xmath1 is @xmath11 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the mean @xmath7 for 13 other groups with @xmath13 kpc is @xmath14 kpc , and the mean @xmath1 is , as it was expected , smaller , @xmath15 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test showed that the hypothesis that both distributions are of the same parent distribution is rejected with sufficiently high significance level @xmath16 .",
    "the groups of the considered two samples contain , on average , practically the same number of member galaxies , 3.6 and 3.7 .",
    "thus , the found correlation is not due to differences of the group masses .",
    "hence , member galaxies in hcgs are , indeed , moving preferentially along the elongation of the corresponding group .",
    "regular movement of member galaxies preferentially along the main axis in hcgs may be explained by the following three ways :    \\1 .",
    "hcgs _ disintegrate _ , and their members _ depart from each other _ in opposite directions .",
    "environmental galaxies _ fall upon the group from opposite directions _",
    "( governato , bhatia & chincarini 1991 , diaferio , geller & ramella 1994 , 1995 ) .    \\3 .",
    "hcgs are _ gravitationally bound systems _ the members of which _ rotate _ around the gravitational center of the group in elongated orbits .",
    "disintegration of a cg may be explained by two possible mechanisms .",
    "_ ejection _ of galaxies in opposite directions from the central galaxy according to ambartsumian s ( 1961 ) or arp s ( 1999 , and references therein ) ideas .",
    "however , no any mechanisms of such processes are known , and we will not consider this option .",
    "_ disintegration _ due to outer gravitational force .",
    "a group would disintegrate if it is located between large clusters .",
    "however , the distribution of orientation of the major axes of hcgs is isotropic in relation to the large cluster - cluster alignment ( palumbo et al .",
    "hence , this option is not real",
    ". the gravitational influence of other cgs may be another possibility .",
    "however , the velocity of galaxies in a group initiated by the gravity force of another group with relatively small mass would be much less than the observed values .",
    "hence , there is no outside acceptable force for stretching the groups .",
    "occasional infall of environmental galaxies upon cgs may certainly take place .",
    "tovmassian , yam , & tiersch ( 2001 ) and tovmassian ( 2001 ) showed that almost each hcg is associated with a lg members of which are distributed along the elongation of the corresponding group .",
    "it was found that @xmath1 of members of a lg is correlated with the elongation of the whole hcg+lg system ( tovmassian & chavushyan 2000 ) .",
    "hence , members of lgs also move preferentially along the elongation of the corresponding system .",
    "this fact seems to be in favor of the infall mechanism .",
    "however , as cosmological n - body simulations showed the filaments are of a wide range of scales ( west 1994 , eisenstain , loeb , & turner 1997 ) , meanwhile the width of hcg+lg systems are less than 125 kpc ( tovmassian 2001 ) .",
    "it means that infall generally should be _",
    "it is not explainable then why cgs are found in very narrow filaments only in which infall may take place from opposite directions . moreover , according to palumbo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) groups of galaxies are not generally aligned with either their nearest neighbors or with abell clusters . on the other hand , it is widely assumed that filaments are connecting large clusters .",
    "it means then , that galaxies in cgs move not along the filaments .",
    "it is , therefore , apparent , that occasional infall may not account for a systematic regular movement of member galaxies .",
    "we are left , then , with the third option - rotation .",
    "if member galaxies rotate around the gravitational center of the group , then in groups observed end - on the galaxies which move towards the observer should be located on one side of the cross - section of the group , while the galaxies which are moving in opposite direction , should be located on the other side . in the case of infall of galaxies upon the group",
    "there should be no any regularity in location of group members . in six out of nine",
    "hcgs with @xmath17 ( elongation of which is oriented close to the line of sight ) the galaxies which are moving towards or from us are well separated on the cross - section of groups ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in only two groups , hcg 20 , and hcg 99 ,",
    "the galaxies with positive and negative residual rvs are mixed over the cross - section of corresponding groups .",
    "another test relates to chain - like groups seen side - on . if galaxies from filaments fall upon the group , then the residual rvs of members of a lg located at one side of the center of the cg+lg system at relatively large distances from it , and that of those located on the other side should have opposite signs . inspection of rvs of compact and poor groups studied by carvalho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) shows that there is no any regularity in distribution of signs of residual rvs in relation to the center of the group .",
    "thus , the relative widths of cross - sections of cgs and filaments , and the radial velocity data on hcgs and associated with them lgs _ contradict _ to suggestion on inward motion of member galaxies .",
    "observational data are _ in favor of systematic rotation _ of member galaxies around the gravitational center of the group .    using the mean value of the crossing time for hcgs , @xmath18 , where @xmath7 is the mean value of the two - dimensional galaxy - galaxy separation , and @xmath19 is the intrinsic three - dimensional velocity dispersion , we may roughly estimate the rotation time .",
    "@xmath7 may be determined more correctly in the chain - like groups , and @xmath19 - in the round groups . for 29 hcgs with @xmath20 the mean @xmath21 kpc , and for 24 round groups with @xmath22 the mean",
    "@xmath19 is @xmath23 km s@xmath12 ( @xmath7 and @xmath19 values are taken from hickson et al .",
    "the mean @xmath24 is @xmath25 years .",
    "if a hcg member makes one revolution during @xmath26 time , then according to kepler s third law , a lg galaxy at a mean distance of 250 kpc from the center of the cg ( tovmassian 2001 ) makes one revolution in @xmath27 years , which is less than the hubble time .",
    "it follows that the faint members may be gravitationally bound with corresponding group , and that the hcg+lg systems may be virialized .",
    "hence , the third option , i.e. rotation of member galaxies around the gravitational center of corresponding hcg is _",
    "the most realistic mechanism_. hcgs are , thus , more stable systems than it has been predicted by n - body simulations in which regular movement of member galaxies were not taken into account .",
    "the probability is high that galaxies during their rotation around the gravitational center of a hcg which has prolate spheroid configuration with relatively small cross - section , would pass close to each other in its central region . here",
    "interactions between them could certainly occur",
    ". however , since the velocities of galaxies near the pericenter of the orbit are sufficiently high , the interaction time is short , the efficiency of interactions would be small , and the merging processes would be rare .",
    "this explains the lack of mergers and the lack of strong radio and fir sources in hcgs .",
    "however , the process of sweeping out the gas from member galaxies may be very effective , and spirals would be converted to elliptical or lenticular galaxies .",
    "indeed , the fraction of spiral galaxies in hcgs , @xmath28 , is significantly less than in the field ( hickson , kindle , & huchra 1988 ) .",
    "it is known that in clusters of galaxies @xmath29 ( solinger & tucker 1972 , quintana & melnick 1982 ) , but groups do have more shallow slope .",
    "it has been generally assumed that the reason is the enhanced ( by one - two orders of magnitude ) x - ray emission of groups .",
    "the excess x - ray luminosity of the low - mass groups is explained by the `` mixed emission '' scenario ( dellantonio et al .",
    "1994 ) when the emission from the intragroup plasma is contaminated by a superposition of diffuse x - ray sources corresponding to the hot interstellar medium of the member galaxies .",
    "tovmassian , yam & tiersch ( 2002 ) showed that the shallow slope of @xmath30 line for groups is due to underestimation of @xmath31s .",
    "the mean @xmath0 of ten rasscals ( mahdavi et al .",
    "2000 ) at the utmost left of the @xmath32 graph is equal to @xmath33 , and that of the groups at the utmost right is @xmath34 . the mean value of @xmath0 of four hcgs ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) located most remote to the left of the line @xmath35 is equal to @xmath36 , while that of the rest 18 groups is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the k - s test rejected with the significance levels @xmath38 and @xmath39 the hyphotesis that in both cases the compared distributions are of the same parent distribution .",
    "hence , the groups located to the left of the @xmath40 line on the @xmath41 graph have the smallest @xmath0 ratios .",
    "they are oriented close to the orthogonal to the line of sight .",
    "for this reason their measured @xmath31 are smaller of the corresponding real value .",
    "location of such groups on the left side of the @xmath42 line creates the impression of the more shallow slope of the @xmath32 correlation .",
    "hence , _ not _ the x - ray luminosities of the cgs are higher than it is expected by the corresponding law for clusters of galaxies , but the @xmath1s of them are _",
    "underestimated_. thus , consideration of geometrical effect solves the longstanding problem of the x - ray emission of groups of galaxies .",
    "it is shown that @xmath31s of hcgs are correlated with their elongation ( tovmassian , martinez & tiersch 1999 ) .",
    "it means that member galaxies in a group move preferentially along its elongation .",
    "it is concluded that members of a hcg most probably rotate in elongated orbits around its gravitational center .",
    "other two possible explanations : the departure of member galaxies in opposite directions , and infall of lg galaxies upon the cg from only opposite directions are ruled out ( tovmassian 2001 , 2002 ) .    the finding that hcgs contain other members distributed along the elongation of the corresponding groups ( tovmassian 2001 , 2002 ; tovmassian , yam , & tiersch 2001 ) , and that their @xmath31 , as that of the proper members of hcgs , correlates with the ellipticity of the whole system ( tovmassian & chavushyan 2000 ) shows that hcgs are the cores of gravitationally bound poor galaxy groups .    hence , hcgs are more stable systems , than it has been assumed .",
    "they have elongated space configuration , contain more members located at relatively large distances from them .",
    "the member galaxies most probably rotate around the gravitational center of the corresponding group .",
    "elongated space configuration of hcgs , and regular rotation of their members around the corresponding gravitational center are in agreement with the observed presence of galaxies with signs of interaction , and smaller relative content of spirals . the lack of apparently merged galaxies is also explained .",
    "all members of elongated groups orientation of which is close to the line of sight are seen near to each other on sky , though the distances between them in space may be high enough .",
    "such systems may often be recognized as poor groups or even poor clusters .",
    "if orientation of elongated group is nearly orthogonal to the line of sight , the group would be detected as a cg in the case if its bright members happen to be close to each other on sky during regular rotation around the gravitational center of the group ."
