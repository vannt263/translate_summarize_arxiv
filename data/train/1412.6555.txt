    "these transport regimes not only have immediate practical relevance for electronic devices @xcite but also provide invaluable clues from which fundamental properties of the microscopic heat carriers can be reconstructed @xcite .    in regular diffusive transport",
    ", fourier s famous law relates the heat flux @xmath8 to the local temperature gradient @xmath9 through the medium s thermal conductivity @xmath10 . in the case of one - dimensional heat flow",
    ", we have @xmath11 however , at length and/or time scales comparable to phonon mean free paths ( mfps ) and/or relaxation times , the fourier law breaks down , and the transport no longer behaves as predicted by standard diffusive theory .",
    "prime observations of such ` quasiballistic ' regimes have been achieved through time domain thermoreflectance ( tdtr ) @xcite and transient thermal grating ( ttg ) @xcite experiments .",
    "a growing body of work has been undertaken to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies have focused on the anomalous shape or temporal signature of the thermal field .",
    "far fewer works have accounted for the fact that the quasiballistic heat flux in a given location at a given time inherently co - depends on the temperature gradient in other places and/or earlier times @xcite .",
    "put differently , the flux - gradient relation ( fgr ) or ` constitutive law ' is no longer localised in nondiffusive transport regimes , but instead possesses ` memory ' in space and/or time .",
    "building upon the pioneering work by mahan and claro for steep gradients @xcite , koh and coworkers recently proposed a nonlocal heat conduction theory @xcite to investigate quasiballistic transport observed in tdtr experiments on semiconductor alloys @xcite .",
    "although this work enabled validation of the main trends , the theory explicitly relied on a set of simplifying assumptions in an ideal debye crystal and consequently only applies to ` weakly quasiballistic ' regimes in the high temperature limit .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal heat equation had to be solved numerically with a finite element scheme that required several thousands of nodes , and lacked flexibility for direct comparison with actual measurement results .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a nonlocal formalism that can describe thermal transport regimes across the entire ballistic - diffusive spectrum without imposing any a priori assumptions on the phonon population of the conducting medium .",
    "we demonstrate that the boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation formally obeys the postulated constitutive law and derive its spatiotemporal fgr memory kernel .",
    "the essential physics of quasiballistic transport regimes can then be captured in highly compact form through synergy with stochastic frameworks .",
    "ttg and tdtr measurements yield nonlocality distances on the order of typical median phonon mfps , as intuitively expected .",
    "we assume a homogeneous , isotropic medium and perform the derivation for one - dimensional heat flow",
    ". a 1d framework will suffice for our purposes , as the dominant physics relevant to ttg and tdtr experiments can be understood in terms of in - plane and cross - plane transport respectively .",
    "we note that explanation of laser spot size effects @xcite does require detailed 3d analysis @xcite and will not be attempted here . in nondiffusive conduction regimes the conventional fourier law ( [ fgr0 ] ) no longer holds .",
    "instead , we can postulate a constitutive law of the form @xmath12 here , @xmath13 embodies the spatial and temporal nonlocality of the heat flux with respect to the temperature gradient .",
    "we will term this quantity the ` nonlocal thermal conductivity kernel ' of the medium .",
    "we immediately stress that @xmath0 must not be confused with the ` effective thermal conductivity ' @xmath5 commonplace in virtually all quasiballistic heat experiments @xcite .",
    "the latter properties arise through phenomenological interpretations @xmath14 that thus maintain a fully localised fgr , in sharp contrast with ( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 varies with experimental conditions and becomes , by construction , a function of grating period ( ttg ) or pump modulation ( tdtr ) , whereas @xmath0 acts as an intrinsic material property of the conducting medium .",
    "qualitatively , the emergence of fgr delocalisation can be easily understood from microscopic heat conduction fundamentals . by definition ,",
    "quasiballistic heat conduction in semiconductors is governed by phonons whose mean free path and/or relaxation time are comparable to the spatial and/or temporal temperature gradient . these heat carriers then indeed forge long - range connections between portions of the thermal field that are diffusively speaking far apart in space and/or time .    on the quantitive side , ( [ convolution ] )",
    "represents a double convolution and thus greatly simplifies by reverting to spatial and temporal frequency domains .",
    "after fourier ( @xmath15 ) and laplace ( @xmath16 ) transformations we have @xmath17 with @xmath18 the complex unit . in a medium with volumetric heat capacity @xmath19 , conservation of energy",
    "requires that @xmath20 at all places and times , and hence @xmath21 where we introduced the volumetric energy density @xmath22 .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath24 express deviations relative to the ambient background .",
    "we now consider a planar source at @xmath25 inside the medium that injects 1@xmath6j / m@xmath26 at time zero to find the single pulse energy density response @xmath27 from which all dynamic system properties can be derived .",
    "given the initial condition @xmath28 we have @xmath29 , so combining ( [ qp1 ] ) and ( [ qp2 ] ) produces @xmath30 \\label{kappamacro}\\ ] ] our derivation solely relied on energy conservation and basic isotropy , without making any other assumptions about the medium s crystal configuration or phonon characteristics .",
    "the result ( [ kappamacro ] ) is therefore universally applicable to all transport regimes across the ballistic - diffusive spectrum in a wide variety of materials .",
    "we can show that the 1d boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) under the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) is formally compatible with the delocalised fgr postulated in ( [ convolution ] ) . inserting the analytical single pulse response @xmath27 of the rta - bte , derived in detail elsewhere @xcite , into ( [ kappamacro ] ) yields @xmath31",
    "this result expresses the ` macroscopic ' nonlocal conductivity kernel @xmath0 in terms of the underlying microscopic phonon dynamics . here , @xmath32 is the thermal conductivity of a phonon mode resolved for wavevector @xmath33 , with mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath34 , group velocity @xmath35 , volumetric heat capacity @xmath36 ( unit j / m@xmath37-k ) and relaxation time @xmath38 .",
    "subscripts @xmath39 indicate @xmath40-projection onto the thermal transport axis . the bulk thermal diffusivity @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the summations running over a discrete wavevector grid ( and , implicitly , over phonon branches ) in ( [ kappamicro ] ) enable seamless analysis of _ ab initio _ phonon data , but can be easily converted to continuous integrals over wavevector space or phonon frequency for analytical modelling .",

    "we note that in integral formulations @xmath46 denotes the heat capacity of a single mode ( unit j / k and equal to the boltzmann constant in the high temperature limit ) .",

    "this indicates that thermal transport governed by the rta - bte can indeed be formally understood and analysed in terms of a delocalised fgr .",
    "note that when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we always find @xmath51 , and hence @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for transport occurring over length and time scales that are sufficiently larger than phonon mfps and relaxation times , the fgr described by ( [ convolution ] ) becomes localised again and reduces to fourier s law , as appropriate .",
    "it is instructive to show that the nonlocal model developed by koh _",
    "@xcite formally correponds to a simple special case of the general framework introduced here .",
    "the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite was constructed under the explicit assumptions that ( i ) measured transients are slow compared to phonon relaxation times ( @xmath50 ) ; ( ii ) the medium is an ideal debye crystal ( each phonon mode propagates at the sound velocity @xmath53 ) with spherical bz ; and ( iii ) the medium operates under its high temperature regime ( all phonon energies obey @xmath54 and consequently @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath57 the absolute ambient temperature ) .",
    "calculations were performed in a semi - infinite geometry , which required special care to ` reflect ' backtravelling phonons reaching the top surface back into the medium .",
    "this complication can be avoided by symmetric extension to a fully infinite medium with heat source at @xmath25 as we have assumed earlier .",
    "the constitutive law derived in ref .",
    "@xcite then reads @xmath58 this obeys the form postulated in our eq .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) , with generalised conductivity kernel @xmath59 note that the final result is independent of @xmath60 since ( [ fgrkoh ] ) is only delocalised in space .",
    "+    we now apply the same set of assumptions @xmath61 adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite to our convolution kernel ( [ kappamicro - spherical ] ) for a spherical bz crystal . with @xmath46 being constant",
    ", the denominator of @xmath62 is dominated by phonon modes with large density of states , i.e. those towards the outer regions of the bz .",
    "these modes have mfps that are significantly smaller than typical length scales of experimentally induced thermal gradients , and we can safely assume @xmath63 for this part of the calculation .",
    "consequently the denominator simply tends to the bulk volumetric heat capacity @xmath19 , and ( [ kappamicro - spherical ] ) reduces to @xmath64 which is indeed identical to ( [ kappakoh ] ) .",
    "contrary to previous work , however , the framework introduced here is equally applicable to fully ballistic ( @xmath65 ) and low temperature regimes , and can readily handle arbitrary bz geometries and phonon dispersions .",
    "several other studies have sought to extend the fourier law to quasiballistic heat flow regimes through harmonic series analysis of bte solutions for grey or dual phonon channel media @xcite .",
    "the resulting heat flux remains fully localised , but involves a correction term in @xmath66 .",
    "it can be shown that these previously derived constitutive laws unknowingly but rigorously correspond to the second order taylor series expansion of the generalised conductivity kernel @xmath0 with respect to spatial frequency @xmath67 .",
    "full details will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "stochastic transport models , which describe the governing dynamics in terms of random motion of energy carriers , have been well established in the literature for a wide variety of applications @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the key fundamentals relevant to our discussion of quasiballistic heat conduction . within the stocastic context ,",
    "the single pulse response @xmath68 expresses the chance to find a randomly wandering energy packet in location @xmath40 at time @xmath69 after it was released by the source in @xmath25 at @xmath70 . in the case of 1d flight processes ,",
    "the packet moves through consecutive jumps @xmath71 where the jump length @xmath72 and wait time @xmath73 are randomly chosen from stochastically independent distributions @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the montroll - weiss equation @xcite provides a closed form solution in fourier - laplace domain for the single pulse response induced by the flight process : @xmath76 } = \\frac{\\psi(s)}{s \\left [ \\psi(s ) + \\psi(\\xi ) \\right ] } \\label{pflights}\\ ] ] where we introduced @xmath77 and @xmath78 for notation convenience .",
    "the associated generalised conductivity kernel given by ( [ kappamacro ] ) then reads @xmath79 in ` poissonian ' flight processes @xmath80 ( the wait time distribution is exponential with average @xmath81 ) , the single pulse response ( [ pflights ] ) and generalised conductivity ( [ kappaflights ] ) simplify to @xmath82 the @xmath60 dependence has vanished from @xmath0 : the fgr in poissonian transport has no temporal memory .",
    "the fgr memory kernel ( [ kappamicro ] ) of the rta - bte becomes equally insensitive to @xmath60 whenever @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , ` weakly quasiballistic ' transport as termed by hua and minnich @xcite is inherently poissonian and only delocalised in space .",
    "relaxation times of the dominant heat carriers in semiconductors typically span the sub - ps to 23@xmath6ns range @xcite , with the longest living modes having the smallest density of states .",
    "we can therefore reasonably assume that the poissonian regime extends up to @xmath83 , or roughly @xmath84mhz , and thus encompasses the typical operational range of ttg and tdtr experiments @xcite .",
    "several subtypes of poissonian flight processes deserve specific mentioning .",
    "the first consists of regular fourier diffusion , whose single pulse response @xmath85 corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "the characterstic jump length @xmath87 and wait time @xmath88 jointly govern the bulk diffusivity through @xmath89 . from ( [ kappapoisson ] ) we have @xmath90 so the fgr correctly reduces to fourier s law .",

    "recalling the functional signatures for poissonian flights ( table i ) , we can postulate a nonlocal diffusivity kernel of the form : @xmath123 over short distances @xmath124 this corresponds to lvy transport with fractal dimension @xmath2 and fractional diffusivity @xmath125 while the long range limit @xmath126 exhibits regular diffusion with bulk diffusivity @xmath127 .",

    "it is noteworthy that the stochastically inspired expression ( [ kappalfxi ] ) describes a generic transition from lvy transport to regular diffusion without making particular assumptions about the nature of the microscopic carriers .",
    "the analysis that follows , therefore , is not limited to heat conduction in semiconductor alloys but can also provide valuable insight to other disciplines where similar dynamics have been observed .",
    "notable examples include sediment transport in rivers @xcite and solute chemical reactions in flows @xcite .",

    "@xmath2 denotes the fractal dimension of the lvy regime while @xmath128 sets the length scale over which the transport recovers to regular diffusion .",

    "heat spreading in the transducer , thermal contact resistance of the metal / semiconductor interface and pulse accumulation effects complicate the processing of raw measurement data @xcite .",
    "a full 3d truncated lvy model described elsewhere @xcite properly accounts for these issues and enables detailed experimental characterisation of the quasiballistic heat flow in semiconductor alloys .",
    "it is therefore not our aim here to use the nonlocal framework for direct tdtr analysis .",
    "rather , we simply wish to provide some qualitative insight on how the inferred effective thermal conductivity relates to the nonlocal conductivity kernel . while the presence of the transducer and in - plane shape of the laser beams entails great care in the fitting procedures , the information that is ultimately extracted",
    "is dominated by 1d cross - plane transport and primarily sensitive to the frequency domain single pulse response @xmath163 of the semiconductor surface @xcite . for our purposes , we can safely ignore the presence of the transducer and again assume an infinite medium with heat source at @xmath25 .",
    "in diffusive regime , a modulated heat source induces an exponential temperature gradient inside the medium : @xmath164 the decay length @xmath165 ranges from @xmath7 m at 1@xmath6mhz to @xmath166 nm at 20@xmath6mhz in typical semiconductor alloys .",
