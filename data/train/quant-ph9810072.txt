    "the study of spontaneous emission and the various means by which it may be modified and controlled has been an active area of quantum optics for many years .",
    "as fluorescence arises from the interaction of the atomic system with the environmental modes , the most obvious mechanism for control is to place the atoms in ` coloured ' ( frequency - dependent ) reservoirs @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by employing , for example , atoms in micro - cavities @xcite , or by placing them near the edge of photonic band gaps @xcite . for atomic media in free space",
    ", quantum interferences have become the most significant mechanism for modifying spontaneous emission .",
    "this was first suggested in the early seventies when agarwal @xcite showed , for an initially prepared degenerate * v*-type three - level atom in free space , that the fluorescence spectrum is modified due to interference and that population trapping occurs @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a number of papers in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s on such interferences @xcite .",
    "recently , with the need for efficient fluorescence control to enable such novel effects as lasing without inversion @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite to be realized , much attention has once more been focused on spontaneous emission dynamics from multi - level atoms @xcite . in a recent article @xcite ,",
    "two of us have proposed a two - colour coherent ` phase ' control scheme @xcite for controlling spontaneous emission in a four - level atom .",
    "phenomena such as extreme spectral narrowing , partial and total cancellation of fluorescence decay were predicted for specific values of the atomic parameters and the lasers phase difference .",
    "moreover , the spectrum was shown to be controlled very effectively and easily by changing the phase difference of the two lasers used for the excitation .    in this article , using a three - level * v*-type atom we discuss a further scheme which offers much promise for controlling spontaneous emission spectra using the phase difference , this time , of two successively applied coherent fields between the decaying excited doublet states .",
    "the proposed scheme is related to other schemes of coherent control , in particular the well - known ` pump - dump ' scheme of atomic ( molecular ) ionization ( dissociation ) @xcite , the coherently driven three - level @xmath0-type atom of martinez et al .",
    "@xcite and ( not with standing the involvement of a photonic band gap material ) to the scheme of quang et al . @xcite .",
    "the main finding in this article is the identification of various competing interference mechanisms leading to phase sensitive means for controlling the spontaneous emission spectra . if we suppose that only one of the two excited states decays and that the atom is initially prepared in that decaying state , then phase insensitive interfering paths arise which lead to the cancellation of a specific fluorescence mode , as explained by knight @xcite and zhu et al.@xcite .",
    "if instead both states are initially prepared in a coherent superposition and the driving field is weak then the spectrum may acquire a fano - type profile .",
    "furthermore , _ phase sensitive _ interference occurs and the spectrum can be controlled via this phase difference . in addition , if both excited states may decay , such that the emitted spontaneous photons may not be distinguishable , even in principle , then further phase sensitive interfering paths via different spontaneous channels arise , similar to those pointed out within a driven @xmath1-type atom by martinez et al .  @xcite .",
    "we discuss each kind of interference separately by identifying the appropriate paths and discuss the role of their co - existence within a single scheme .",
    "in particular we find that both phase - dependent interference mechanisms may be destructive simultaneously and thus lead to spontaneous emission cancellation in different parts of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , fluorescence inhibition by one mechanism may also be enhanced due to the presence of the other .",
    "an alternative explanation of the phase dependent interferences is also given in the dressed states picture .",
    "in particular we find , for an appropriate phase difference , that the atom can be prepared in a single decoupled dressed state in which total cancellation of the fluorescence associated with the other ( unpopulated ) dressed state occurs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the atomic model and the basic dynamical equations in the bare states basis .",
    "we solve these equations for the various situations of interest and present , in certain cases , analytical phase - dependent formulae for the time evolution of the population and the spontaneous emission spectrum of this atom . in section",
    "iii we present and analyze our basic results , and in particular discuss the situations where each of the various interference mechanisms become significant and dominate .",
    "an alternative analysis using the dressed - state basis is given in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "the atomic model considered here is shown in figure 1 . a three level * v*-type atom",
    "is initially prepared in a superposition of the two upper levels by a pump field such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the phase of the pump field . at time @xmath4",
    "this atom starts to interact with a microwave field of frequency @xmath5 and phase @xmath6 which couples the two upper levels .",
    "we allow both upper states to decay spontaneously to the lower state . here",
    ", we only consider the case of a square pulse of the microwave field .",
    "this atomic system has been used as a model system for the proposal of the quantum - beat laser @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be described using the schrdinger equation .",
    "then , the wavefunction of the system at time @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of the state vectors as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes both the momentum vector and the polarization of the emitted photon .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the interaction representation is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 we substitute this hamiltonian into the schrdinger equation and obtain the following set of equations after the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is carried out @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the rabi frequency , which is considered real for convenience in our problem and @xmath14 represents the microwave field detuning .",
    "the notation @xmath15 is used throughout this work .",
    "we proceed by performing a formal time integration of equation ( [ k ] ) and substitute the result into equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) to obtain @xmath16 once the markov approximation is carried out within the weisskopf - wigner theory @xcite , the above equations ( [ 1a ] ) , ( [ 2a ] ) reduce to the following form ( after the assumption @xmath17 is taken into account ) @xmath18 here , @xmath19 @xmath20 and the radiative shifts , which are related to the lamb shift , will be omitted in this approach .",
    "the term @xmath21 is a common term which arises if quantum interference from both spontaneous emission channels from the two closely spaced upper levels is involved @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 denotes the alignment of the two matrix elements and is defined as @xmath23 . for orthogonal matrix elements this yields @xmath24 ( no interference ) and for parallel matrix elements we obtain @xmath25 ( maximum interference ) . in the language of quantum pathway interference",
    ", different pathways involving different spontaneously emitted photons may only be indistinguishable , even in principle , if the corresponding transitions give rise to photons of identical polarization .",
    "this means that the associated dipoles have to be parallel . in the language of off - diagonal couplings ,",
    "those extra terms in @xmath22 may only arise if both dipoles involved interact with the same modes of the vacuum .",
    "since the time dependence of this term is @xmath26 this term can be omitted from these equations only in the case that the energy difference of the two upper levels @xmath27 is larger than the decay rates @xmath28 @xcite . however , for a moment , let us omit these interference terms by setting @xmath24 in order to obtain analytical solutions of these equations .",
    "we will return to the importance of such an interference in the calculation of the spectrum .",

    "in fact the @xmath47 terms in @xmath48 should be read as @xmath49 , showing that here an absorption of a microwave photon is always associated with the subsequent emission of another , cancelling the phase dependence . furthermore , for @xmath50 , thus initial population also in the upper excited state",
    ", we obtain new phase ",
    "dependent terms in @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to interfering paths as depicted in figure 2(b2 ) .",
    "here the path differs from that in 2(a ) only by a single photon of the driving field , explaining the phase dependence .",
    "for @xmath53 we should go back to the equations of motion ( [ k ] ) , ( [ 1b ] ) , ( [ 2b ] ) , and study numerically the behaviour of the system . then , the most complex additional phase dependent interference arise , which is associated with paths involving indistinguishable spontaneous photons from different transitions as depicted in figs .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b3 ) .",
    "this interference becomes maximal if both transitions to the ground state are exactly parallel and as we will see later , when both levels are closely spaced , i.e. photons arising from both transitions become essentially indistinguishable .",
    "this type of interference has been drown much attention recently both for its effects on spontaneous emission dynamics of multi - level atoms @xcite but also for its effects on the absorption , dispersion and population dynamics of these atoms @xcite . actually , it is this type of interference that leads to the phase dependence in the microwave driven @xmath1-type system studied by martinez et al .",
    "@xcite as happens in our scheme if the system is initially in one of the two excited states ( either @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) .",
    "if our system is furthermore initially prepared in a superposition of states @xmath44 and @xmath56 @xmath57 then phase dependent dynamics is observable even if @xmath24 as pointed out earlier , due to the processes of figs .  2(a ) and 2(b2 ) .",
    "we begin with an analysis of the system when one of the spontaneous decay rates is much smaller than the other and can be omitted , say @xmath58 .",
    "this reduces our system to that studied by knight @xcite and by zhu et al .",
    "if we choose the atom to be initially in state @xmath44 @xmath59 then quantum interference can lead to complete or partial cancellation of specific emission modes and to spectral narrowing of one of the two peaks of the spectrum .",
    "the leading interfering process for weak driving fields is depicted in fig .",
    "the system in this situation , however , is not phase sensitive .",
    "this occurs because stimulated absorption of a driving field photon is associated with the subsequent stimulated emission of another photon , taking it back to the decaying state and thus cancelling the phase dependence .",

    "the form of the spectrum for this case is shown in figure 3 .",
    "for the particular values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 the spectrum resembles a fano - type form @xcite , as shown in figures 3(a ) and 3(c ) .",
    "the zero disappears for other values of the phase @xmath69 , as for example for @xmath70 , as shown in figure 3(b ) where the spectrum is simply a single lorentzian peak .",
    "the existence of this interference in the spectrum is associated with additional interfering paths as indicated in figure 2(b2 ) .",
    "obviously the interferences need not be destructive for each choice of parameters , so that we have an exact zero in the spectrum only for particular choices in the phase @xmath69 .",
    "an equally intuitive way of understanding the interferences can be given in the dressed states picture and a detailed explanation will be given in the following section .",
    "a similar effect has been investigated by coleman and knight @xcite in the related area of resonant two - photon ionization and by agassi in the area of spontaneous emission of autoionizing states @xcite .",
    "we note , that the appearance of exact zeros in the fluorescence spectrum is very sensitive to the radiative emission of the other level @xmath71 .",
    "then various interfering paths analogous to figure 2(a ) and figure 2(b3 ) arise with decay from the upper excited state @xmath72 , and obviously those do not need to interference destructively for the same parameters at the same frequency .",
    "for example , in figure 4 we present the results for the spontaneous emission spectrum of this atom , now assuming a very weak emission from level @xmath56 , i.e.  @xmath73 but also @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the exact zero noted earlier has disappeared for those parameters . in this case",
    "the spectrum will also depend on the value of @xmath22 . with both decay channels open and with @xmath53",
    "we involve further interfering channels such as those presented in figure 2(b3 ) .",
    "the dashed curve in figure 4 shows the results with @xmath24 using eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) and the solid curve the results with @xmath25 from a numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ k ] ) , ( [ 1b ] ) , ( [ 2b ] ) . for @xmath24 we can immediately see that even for a small @xmath75 of @xmath76 , as shown in figure 4(a ) , the precise zero disappears and a minimum well above zero takes its place in the spectrum .",
    "this minimum is further lifted when the decay rate of the upper excited state increases , as displayed in figures 4(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "in addition , a second peak appears in the spectrum due to the second decay rate . in the case that @xmath25",
    "the behaviour of the system is more complex due to the additional interfering channels originating from the mechanism displayed in figs .",
    "2(a ) , 2(b3 ) .",
    "firstly , we note specifically from figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) that the presence of this additional interference mechanism enhances the inhibition of spontaneous emission in the fano minimum .",
    "secondly , an additional zero appears in the spectrum which is solely associated with the new interference mechanism .",
    "this zero is quite stable to the increase of the decay rate @xmath75 .",
    "these results clearly show the co - existence of two distinguished mechanisms for fluorescence inhibition , which can act either independently or jointly in order to modify the spectrum .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the case when @xmath77 and @xmath62 and examine the phase dependence of the system .",
    "we have seen from the previous discussion that the fano interferences due to the decay channels @xmath78 and @xmath75 do not interfere destructively at the same frequency .",

    "however , for any other value between @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the relative phase @xmath69 the emission spectrum is made up of four peaks ( two associated with each bare state contribution for each of the two dressed states ) , as shown in figures 5(b)(d ) . for @xmath90",

    "also @xmath103 is the energy difference of the dressed states .",
    "the probability amplitudes of the dressed states are connected to the probability amplitudes of the bare states by the following relations , @xmath104 using the initial condition , eq .",

    "such a coupling is usually referred as the off - diagonal coupling of the dressed states @xcite . in the specific case",
    "that one of the two bare excited states decays ( @xmath58 ) , the dressed decay rates read @xmath111 if system is initially in one of the dressed states ( @xmath100 dressed - state in the case of figure 3(a ) and @xmath99 dressed - state in the case of figure 3(c ) ) then population is efficiently transfered to the other dressed state due to this coupling via the ground state .",
    "this opens new channels for spontaneous emission and consequently interference structures in the spectrum , similar to a fano - type behaviour .",
    "for both states decaying transfer also occurs but the actual forms of the dressed decay rates is far more complicated .    in the strong - field limit the energies of the dressed - states differ substantially and the off - diagonal coupling is very weak , as the oscillating terms @xmath112 become large . in this case , the two dressed - states can be thought of decaying independently @xcite .",
    "depending on the relative phase @xmath69 either the positive or the negative frequency peaks of the spectrum can completely disappear , as can be seen in figures 5(a ) and 5(e ) .",
    "this occurs as we can selectively populate one of the dressed states initially by appropriately choosing the phase difference @xmath69 as explained by eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) .",
    "this dressed - state will subsequently decay without any transfer to the other dressed - state and a two peak structure may be created in the spectrum , where the two peaks are separated by the bare states doublet spacing ( given both bares states can decay ) . even without selective dressed state preparation there is no interference in the strong field limit based on dressed off - diagonal couplings and extra paths due to dressed population transfer .",
    "this would furthermore be impossible because photons emitted from different dressed states become well distinguishable if they are apart in frequency by more than the largest spontaneous emission rate . in spite of a large dressed states separation",
    "however , interference may still occur according to the mechanism described in figure 2(b3 ) .",
    "this is because the two bare contributions of each dressed state then represent the different corner stones for interfering paths rather than different dressed states , rendering only the spacing between the bare states relevant in this situation .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of the relative phase between a pump and a coupling field on the spontaneous emission spectrum from a three level * v*-type system .",
    "we have shown that the modification of this phase difference allows us to efficiently control the shape of the spontaneous emission spectrum and the population dynamics .",
    "various interference mechanisms were identified from the underlying transition physics .",
    "the various phase dependent and independent interferences responsible for the spectral structure depend sensitively on the relative energy and decay rates of the two excited states and on the orientation of the corresponding dipoles .",
    "in particular , we have shown that in the case in which only one excited state decays , the spontaneous emission spectrum can exhibit a fano - type behaviour in the weak - field limit and cancellation of the emission in a specific vacuum mode ( i.e. specific radiated frequencies ) occurs . in the dressed state picture this originates from interferences involving indistinguishable photons due to an off - diagonal coupling between the dressed states . in this case",
    "the addition of decay to the other excited state could lead to more complicated sources of quantum interference .",
    "we have also emphasised that the dressed states decouple from each other for strong driving fields yielding an inhibition of this source of interference . as a consequence of this decoupling , for specific initial preparation of solely one dressed state",
    ", we noted the inhibition of the total fluorescence corresponding to the other dressed state .",
    "this is controlled using the relative phase @xmath69 which arises from the fact that the emission paths differ by an unequal number of stimulated absorptions and emissions of the microwave field photons .",
    "if the excited doublet states are closely spaced with respect to both decay rates and the corresponding emission dipoles are parallel , a different phase dependent source of interference arises .",
    "this mechanism also survives in the strong driving field limit because it is not based on the coupling among the two dressed states as the previous mechanism but on that of the bare states contribution for each dressed state independently . in general , all these different sources of interference are present and compete , giving rise to a rich regime of parameters to shape the spectrum .",
    "an experimental realisation of the phenomena discussed in this paper is possible using recent developments in quantum optics .",
    "for the first interference case , where the dipole moments of the two spontaneous emission transitions are orthogonal or the two upper states are well separated , the only essential part is the preparation of the excited doublet , as the atomic configuration can be realized in many atomic ( or molecular ) systems .",
    "this preparation can be achieved , for example , by pulses of specific area or by adiabatic transfer methods @xcite .",
    "the second case is more restrictive in finding the proper atomic ( or molecular ) configuration as it requires the spontaneous emission matrix elements to be parallel , and the quantum states close in energy .",
    "however , a similar configuration has been found in sodium dimers and already evidence of a related interference have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "other possible experimental proposals include the use of atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that this type of interference has been recently observed in tunnelling transitions from semiconductor quantum wells @xcite .",
