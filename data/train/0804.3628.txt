    "in networks of dynamics agents , _ `` consensus '' _ means that all agents need to agree upon certain quantities of interest that depend on their state .",
    "`` consensus protocol '' _ is an interaction rule that specifies the information exchange between an agent and all of its neighbors on the network , and enables the network to achieve consensus via a process of distributed decision making .",
    "consensus problems ( see @xcite-@xcite ) have a long history in the field of computer science , particularly in automata theory and distributed computation .",
    "recently , distributed coordination of networks of dynamic agents has attracted several researchers from various disciplines of engineering and science due to the broad applications of multi - agent systems in many areas , such as collective behavior of flocks and swarms @xcite , synchronization of coupled oscillators @xcite-@xcite , and so on .    until now",
    ", most papers in the literature mainly concern the consensus problem under linear protocols , with the connection topologies time - varying , state - dependent ( see @xcite-@xcite ) . even in those papers investigating nonlinear protocols , like @xcite , a strong assumption on networks",
    "should be satisfied : the interaction topology should be bidirectional",
    ". however , unidirectional communication is important in practical applications and can be easily incorporated , for example , via broadcasting . also , sensed information flow which plays a central role in schooling and flocking is typically not bidirectional .",
    "so , in this paper , we will look at the consensus problem in networks of dynamic agents , described by ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , under nonlinear protocols with directed topology . this note can be regarded to extend consensus results under undirected graphs in @xcite to the case of directed graphs .",
    "our approach is to model the communication topology as a graph , then by merging spectral graph theory , matrix theory and control theory , we can prove rigorously that if the directed graph is strongly connected and the nonlinear protocol is strictly increasing , then consensus problem can be realized .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the consensus problem on graphs . in section iii , we first define the nonlinear protocol , then based on some lemmas of algebraic graph theory and matrix theory , we obtain the main theoretical result . in section iv ,",
    "two simple examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical result .",
    "we conclude this paper in section v.",
