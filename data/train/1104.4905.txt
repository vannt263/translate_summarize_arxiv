    "linear system stability can be formulated semialgebraically in the space of coefficients of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "the region of stability is generally _ nonconvex _ in this space , and this is a major obstacle when solving fixed - order and/or robust controller design problems . using the hermite stability criterion , these problems can be formulated as parametrized polynomial matrix inequalities ( pmis ) where parameters account for uncertainties and the decision variables are controller coefficients .",
    "recent results on real algebraic geometry and generalized problems of moments can be used to build up a hierarchy of convex linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) _",
    "outer _ approximations of the region of stability , with asymptotic convergence to its convex hull , see e.g. @xcite for a software implementation and examples , and see @xcite for an application to pmi problems arising from static output feedback design .    if outer approximations of nonconvex semialgebraic sets can be readily constructed with these lmi relaxations , _ inner _ approximations are much harder to obtain",
    ". however , for controller design purposes , inner approximations are essential since they correspond to sufficient conditions and hence guarantees of stability or robust stability . in the robust systems control literature ,",
    "convex inner approximations of the stability region have been proposed in the form of polytopes @xcite , ellipsoids @xcite or more general lmi regions @xcite derived from polynomial positivity conditions .",
    "interval analysis can also be used in this context , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a numerical scheme for approximating from inside the feasible set @xmath0 of a parametrized pmi @xmath1 ( for some matrix polynomial @xmath2 ) , that is , the set of points @xmath3 such that @xmath1 for _ all _ values of the parameter @xmath4 in some specified domain @xmath5 ( assumed to be a basic compact semialgebraic set ) .",
    "this includes as a special case the approximation of the stability region ( and the robust stability region ) of linear systems .",
    "the particular case where @xmath6 is affine in @xmath3 covers parametrized lmis with many applications in robust control , as surveyed e.g. in @xcite .    given a compact set @xmath7 containing @xmath8",
    ", this numerical scheme consists of building up a sequence of inner approximations @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which fulfils two essential conditions :    1 .",
    "the approximation converges in a _ well - defined analytic _",
    "sense ; 2 .",
    "each set @xmath11 is defined in a _",
    "simple _ manner , as a superlevel set of a single polynomial . in our mind , this feature is essential for a successful implementation in practical applications .    more precisely , we provide a hierarchy of inner approximations @xmath12 of @xmath8 , where each @xmath13 is a basic semi - algebraic set for some polynomial @xmath14 of degree @xmath15 .",
    "the vector of coefficients of the polynomial @xmath14 is an optimal solution of an lmi problem .",
    "when @xmath15 increases , the convergence of @xmath12 to @xmath8 is very strong .",
    "indeed , the lebesgue volume of @xmath11 converges to the lebesgue volume of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , on any ( a priori fixed ) compact set @xmath16 , the sequence @xmath17 converges for the @xmath18-norm on @xmath16 to the function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix - polynomial @xmath6 associated with the pmi .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 in ( lebesgue ) measure on @xmath16 , and @xmath22 almost everywhere and almost uniformly on @xmath16 , for a subsequence @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , if one defines the piecewise polynomial @xmath24 , then @xmath25 almost everywhere , almost uniformly and in ( lebesgue ) measure on @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we can easily enforce that the inner approximations @xmath12 are nested and/or convex .",
    "of course , for the latter convex approximations , convergence to @xmath8 is lost if @xmath8 is not convex . however , on the other hand , having a convex inner approximation of @xmath8 may reveal to be very useful , e.g. , for optimization purposes .    on the practical and computational sides ,",
    "the quality of the approximation of @xmath8 depends heavily on the chosen set @xmath26 on which to make the approximation of the function @xmath27 .",
    "the smaller @xmath16 , the better the approximation . in particular",
    ", it is worth emphasizing that when the set @xmath8 to approximate is the stability or robust stability region of a linear system , then its particular geometry can be exploited to construct a tight bounding set @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , a good approximation of @xmath8 is obtained significantly faster than with an arbitrary set @xmath16 containing @xmath8 .",
    "finally , let us insist that the main goal of the paper is to show that it is possible to provide a tight and explicit inner approximation with no quantifier , of nonconvex feasible sets described with quantifiers .",
    "then this new feasible set can   be used for optimization purposes and we are facing two cases :    * the convex case : if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are convex polynomials , @xmath30 and @xmath31 then the optimization problem @xmath32 is polynomially solvable .",
    "indeed , functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are polynomially computable , of polynomial growth , and the feasible set is polynomially bounded .",
    "then polynomial solvability of the problem follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3.1 ) . *",
    "the nonconvex case : if @xmath29 is not convex then notice that firstly we still have an optimization problem with no quantifier , a nontrivial improvement . secondly we are now faced with an polynomial optimization problem with a single polynomial constraint and possibly bound constraints @xmath36 .",
    "one may then apply the hierarchy of convex lmi relaxations described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "of course , in general , polynomial optimization is np - hard .",
    "however , if the size of the problem is relatively small and the degree of @xmath37 is small , practice seems to reveal that the problem is solved exactly with few relaxations in many cases , see @xcite .",
    "in addition , if some structured sparsity in the data is present then one may even solve problems of potentially large size by using an appropriate sparse version of these lmi relaxations as described in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ problem ] we formally state the problem to be solved . in section [ lmi ]",
    "we describe our hierarchy of inner approximations . in section [ control ] , we show that the specific geometry of the stability region can be exploited , as illustrated on several standard problems of robust control .",
