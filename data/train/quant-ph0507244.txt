    "<S> ( [ refr ] ) reduces , as it should , to the correct result for @xmath1 and @xmath2 independent atoms .    on inspecting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ refr ] ) ( involving @xmath82 ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig-2ab]a ) one can easily recognize that the susceptibility @xmath116 is substantially enhanced via collective effects . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath121 means that @xmath122 while @xmath123 and , respectively , the susceptibility is small though nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a single - type atomic ensemble one can achieve complete transparency at this point . </S>",
    "<S> increasing further @xmath124 , i.e. @xmath125 , the dressed -state population is transferred completely to @xmath126 and the probe field is amplified . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the second ensemble contributes here to a strong shift of the susceptibility resulting in zero absorption with large dispersive features . in particular , the index of refraction yield with close to vanishing absorption @xmath127 @xcite which for the sample parameters given above takes values larger than @xmath128 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig-3ab]a ) near @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> however , without collective effects , i.e. a noninteracting ensemble of @xmath1 = @xmath130 atoms , the index of refraction would only be close to unity at the point of vanishing absorption </S>",
    "<S> . the index of refraction @xmath131 can be further enhanced by increasing @xmath132 , but then the atoms would be such close to each other that short - range dipole - dipole interactions need be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath133 may be smaller than @xmath134 at frequencies where the absorption vanishes meaning that the weak - probe field can not propagate anymore through the atomic medium ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-3ab ] ) .    furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> once the probe field frequency is adjusted near resonance with the bare - state transition frequencies of atoms @xmath11 or @xmath12 , one can observe steep dispersive features at @xmath135 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2ab]b ) . however , the magnitude of the susceptibility , in this case , is the same as for a few - atom sample , except the dispersive slopes . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be employed to induce a rapid phase shift for a weak field travelling through the strongly driven atomic sample . </S>",
    "<S> note that at the points , where the @xmath36 change the sign , the two - level emitters are in a strong collective phase @xcite and , thus , abrupt changes of @xmath133 are due to strong collectivity . also , the collisional damping does not affect considerably the collective steady - state behavior , and its influence can be balanced by increasing the number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the collisional damping influences small atomic samples while larger atomic systems are less sensitive with regard to kind of phase damping .     </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state dependence of the linear susceptibility @xmath136 ( in units of @xmath137 ) as well as that of the derivation @xmath138 ( in units of @xmath139 ) as a function of @xmath140 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath141 ( a , b ) , and @xmath142 ( c , d ) , while @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b , d ) are enlargements of ( a , c).,width=317,height=226 ]    we demonstrate further that collections of two - level atoms are suitable for rapidly switching between strongly accelerating or slowing down of a weak probe pulse traversing through driven two - level media . </S>",
    "<S> the light group velocity can be estimated from the following expressions : @xmath147 , where @xmath148 . for @xmath149 </S>",
    "<S> , i.e. @xmath150 , @xmath151 @xmath152 may reach values of order of @xmath153 of either sign [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig-3ab]b , d ) where @xmath154 . the refractive index may take values below unity at such moderate atomic densities . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by properly choosing the external parameters one can arrive at rather low subluminal or large superluminal group velocities .    in summary we have demonstrated that collective interactions among two - level radiators are suitable to generate highly refractive media with ghz switching times to strongly deviating properties . </S>",
