    "the observation of the ridge , a long range pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) correlation at near - side  @xcite , in dihadron correlations has motivated many theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "understanding the formation mechanism of the ridge may provide insight into the early dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "we investigate the ridge using two tools : dihadron correlation relative to event plane and 3-particle @xmath1-@xmath1 correlations .",
    "we discuss what have already been learned from previous studies  @xcite and present new findings at this conference .",
    "the ridge magnitude was found to decrease with trigger particle azimuth relative to event plane ( @xmath3 ) from in - plane ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath4@xmath6@xmath7 ) to out - of - plane ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath4@xmath6@xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "motivated by our data , chiu and hwa  @xcite proposed the correlated emission model ( cem ) where the ridge is formed by correlated particle emission due to aligned jet propagation and medium flow and predicted asymmetric near - side @xmath0 correlations .",
    "we present a study of this asymmetry from our data .",
    "we found the ridge is asymmetric and the asymmetry peaks at @xmath5@xmath6@xmath9 .",
    "the broadness of the ridge was found to be event - by - event from 3-particle @xmath1-@xmath1 correlations  @xcite . by further analyzing their charge dependence , we may separate jet - like and ridge components without assuming the shape of the ridge in @xmath1 .",
    "we find like - sign triplets are dominated by ridge and use this observation to separate the jet - like and ridge components .",
    "we find jet - like correlation is narrow , and ridge is broad and approximately uniform in @xmath1 .",
    "dihadron correlations are studied for trigger particles separately in @xmath5@xmath10@xmath7 and @xmath5@xmath11@xmath7 for 20 - 60@xmath12 au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath13 ranges of the trigger and associated particles are 3@xmath11@xmath14@xmath114 gev / c and 1@xmath11@xmath15@xmath11 2 gev / c , respectively , and both within @xmath4@xmath16@xmath4@xmath111 .",
    "the event plane angle is constructed from particles outside the @xmath13 range used in the correlation study .",
    "the dihadron correlation signal obtained for each @xmath5 slice has a large background contribution from anisotropic flow ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",

    "the jet - like yield is obtained from the difference between the raw correlation in @xmath4@xmath1@xmath190.7 , containing both jet - like component and the ridge , and that in @xmath4@xmath1@xmath200.7 ( scaled by @xmath1 acceptance factor ) containing presumably only the ridge component .",

    "the ridge is found to be asymmetric with the maximum asymmetry appearing at @xmath5@xmath645@xmath24 , while jet is symmetric .",
    "the ridge asymmetry is persistent for different associated @xmath13 .",
    "the ridge asymmetry is qualitatively consistent with the cem prediction  @xcite , suggesting that formation of the ridge may be due to jet - flow alignment .",
    "however , we note that cem does not have dynamics depending on particle @xmath13 , nor does it have mechanisms to create correlations between particles separated by large @xmath1 . in general , the ridge @xmath0 asymmetry may be obtained by models which incorporate interplay between jet propagation and radial flow .",
    "we have analyzed the 3-particle @xmath1-@xmath1 correlations data in @xmath25+au , 40 - 80@xmath12 and 0 - 12@xmath12 au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev  @xcite . the trigger and associated particles",

    "the correlation is separated for like - sign and unlike - sign pairs .",
    "there are more unlike - sign than like - sign pairs at @xmath4@xmath1@xmath4@xmath60 .",

    "the unlike - sign and like - sign correlations are similar indicating the ridge particles have no charge dependence .",
    "correlation in same - sign triplets should be dominated by ridge correlation because the probability of a jet fragmenting into 3 same - sign particles in our @xmath13 range is negligible .",

    "the average correlation signal seems to be uniform over @xmath1-@xmath1 region . to quantify this we study the average signal as a function of @xmath31 on @xmath1-@xmath1 plane , shown in fig  [ fig3](right ) for @xmath32 ( @xmath29+@xmath30 ) and @xmath29 in 0 - 12@xmath12 au+au collisions .",
    "@xmath32 contains both jet - like and ridge contributions while @xmath29 is dominated by ridge .",
    "since the ridge at large @xmath1 is identical for like - sign and unlike - sign trigger - associated pairs in dihadron correlations , it should also be the same at large @xmath1 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 because the change from the dihadron to trihadron correlation is the addition of third particle of the same charge sign .     on @xmath1-@xmath1 plane for 3@xmath11@xmath14@xmath1110 gev / c and 1@xmath11@xmath15@xmath113 gev / c in 0 - 12@xmath12 au+au collisions .",
    "the curves are gaussian fits to the data . ]",
    "therefore , the total jet - like component can be obtained by : jet = 3(@xmath30 - @xmath29 ) , where the factor of 3 takes into account the jet contribution from @xmath30 and @xmath33 charge combinations .",
    "the ridge can then be obtained by subtracting the jet - like component from the total 3-particle correlation where all charge combinations are included . alternatively the ridge can be taken simply as 4 times @xmath29 .",
    "the two methods yield consistent results .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the average signal of the separated ridge and jet - like components from 3-particle @xmath1-@xmath1 correlations as a function of @xmath31 on @xmath1-@xmath1 plane for 0 - 12@xmath12 au+au collisions .",
    "the jet - like component is narrow and symmetric between @xmath28 and @xmath16 having a gaussian width @xmath340.25@xmath350.09 . the separated ridge , while narrow in @xmath0 , is extremely broad with gaussian width @xmath341.53@xmath350.41 .",
    "the ridge is also consistent with a uniform distribution within our acceptance with reasonable @xmath36/ndf .",
    "in summary , we have presented dihadron correlations relative to event plane for au+au 20 - 60@xmath12 collisions . while jet - like correlation is symmetric , ridge is found to be asymmetric when trigger particle azimuth is between in- and out - of - plane .",
    "the asymmetry is qualitatively consistent with the correlated particle emission model prediction , suggesting the formation mechanism of the ridge may be due to alignment of jet propagation and medium flow .",
    "we have used the charge ordering properties to separate the jet - like and ridge components via 3-particle @xmath1-@xmath1 correlations in 0 - 12@xmath12 au+au collisions .",
    "this stems out of the observation that like - sign triplets are dominated by the ridge .",
    "we found that the jet - like correlation is narrowly confined , and the ridge is broadly distributed being approximately uniform in @xmath1 in our measured acceptance .",
    "except small angle correlation in azimuth , the ridge particles appear to be uncorrelated not only with the trigger particle , but also between themselves in @xmath1 .",
