    "cooling flow groups and clusters contain large amounts of hot x - ray emitting gas that should be radiatively cooling on time scales less than a hubble time ( see fabian , nulsen & canizares 1984 for an early review of cooling flows ) .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the original cooling flow scenario was the ultimate fate of the cooling gas . while diffuse h@xmath4 emission was commonly found within the central dominant galaxy ( cdg ) in cooling flows ( heckman 1981 ; hu et al .",
    "1985 ) and star formation was observed in cluster cooling flows as early as mcnamara & oconnell ( 1989 ) , the observed star formation rates were orders of magnitudes less than the inferred mass deposition rates of the hot gas .",
    "the cooling flow scenario underwent a major modification after the launch of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray telescopes .",
    "_ chandra _ , with its high spatial resolution , discovered agn - induced cavities and shocks within cooling flows ( e.g. , mcnamara et al .",

    "2011 ) have shown that the mechanical power of the agn in the cdg is sufficient to prevent the bulk of the hot gas from cooling .",
    "while agn feedback probably prevents most of the hot gas from cooling , star formation has now been detected in many cdgs residing at the centers of cooling flows ( e.g. , allen et al .",
    "1995 ; rafferty et al . 2006 ; donahue et al . 2007 ;",
    "quillen et al .",
    "2008 ) and there are many indications that the star formation is a product of the cooling flow , including : 1 ) a correlation between the star formation rate in cdgs and the spectroscopic mass deposition rate ( odea et al .",
    "2008 ) , 2 ) the existence of a sharp threshold for star formation that occurs when the cooling time of the hot gas is less than about 1  gyr ( rafferty et al .",

    "there is also evidence that a1835 may have a high velocity molecular outflow driven by the radio jets or buoyant x - ray cavities .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a cycle 0 alma observation of ngc 5044 in the co(2 - 1 ) emission line .",
    "the ngc 5044 group of galaxies is the x - ray brightest group in the sky and has a very smooth and nearly spherically symmetric large scale x - ray morphology .",
    "however , the central region of ngc 5044 is highly perturbed with many agn - inflated cavities , cool x - ray filaments , cold fronts and multiphase gas ( buote et al .",

    "was made towards the center of ngc 5044 ( ra=13:15:23.97 , dec-16.23.07.5 ) on 2012 january 13 .",
    "the primary beam of alma at 1.3  mm is @xmath10  27@xmath11 arcsec at full - width half maximum and provides a field of view of @xmath10  4.0 kpc at the distance of ngc 5044 .",

    "the quasar 3c 279 served as the bandpass calibrator and titan as the absolute flux ( primary ) calibrator .",
    "the amount of precipitable water vapor during our observation was 1.4 mm    the correlator was configured to provide four spectral windows in two linear polarizations ( no measurements of the cross products were made in alma cycle 0 ) .",
    "each spectral window spanned a total bandwidth of 1875  mhz and was split into 3840 channels so that each channel had a width of 488.28125  khz .",
    "one of the spectral windows was centered on the co(2 - 1 ) line ( 1.3-mm band ) at the systemic velocity of ngc 5044 , providing a velocity resolution of 0.64  km  s@xmath3 in co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "the other three spectral windows ( 229.336 - 231.211 ghz , 241.270 - 243.145 ghz and 242.853 - 244.728 ghz ) covered line - free regions to measure the continuum emission of ngc 5044 , necessary for subtracting any continuum emission at the frequency of the co(2 - 1 ) line .",
    "as explained below , we detected relatively strong continuum emission from the central agn of ngc 5044 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the software package casa by the alma observatory .",
    "the calibrated data , along with a set of continuum - subtracted channel maps in co(2 - 1 ) , were delivered to us on 2013 march 4 . to make channel maps suitable to our own needs",
    ", we performed our own continuum subtraction in the co(2 - 1 ) line and made channel maps at our own desired velocity resolutions and weightings of the visibility data .",
    "the synthesized beam attained in our cycle 0 alma observation was 1.4@xmath11 by 2.2@xmath11 fwhm ( 210 by 330  pc ) .",
    "we adopt a systemic velocity of 2758  km  s@xmath3 for ngc 5044 and a luminosity distance of 31.2  mpc ( tonry et al .",

    "the most significant co(2 - 1 ) feature in the alma cycle 0 spectrum within the central 1  kpc diameter region is the redshifted emission between 0 and 120  km  s@xmath3 with a sharp peak at 60  km  s@xmath3 ( see fig .",

    "while the redshifted portions of the iram 30 m and alma spectra are in reasonably good agreement , the integrated flux density in the blueshifted portion of the alma spectrum is only 20% of that in the iram 30 m data .",

    "we found that a bin width of 50  km  s@xmath3 optimized the signal - to - noise of the emission lines .",
    "2 displays channel maps between -350  km  s@xmath3 and 150  km  s@xmath3 in 50  km  s@xmath3 slices .",
    "a total of 24 molecular structures are detected with a co(2 - 1 ) surface brightness exceeding @xmath14 within the central 2.5  kpc ( 16.7@xmath11 ) where the primary beam response is greater than 0.3 .",
    "more structures are detected at larger radii , but we limit all further analysis in this paper to these 24 molecular structures .",
    "our alma data covered a velocity range from -400 to 400  km  s@xmath3 centered    on the systemic velocity of ngc 5044 .",
    "no molecular structures were detected in emission with redshifts between 150 - 400  km  s@xmath3 or blueshifts between 350 - 400  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "however , an absorption feature is detected in the central continuum source at 250  km  s@xmath3 and is discussed further in @xmath15 .",
    "the channel maps show that the velocity distribution of the molecular structures in ngc 5044 is highly asymmetric .",
    "there are 16 blueshifted structures and only 8 redshifted structures within the central 2.5  kpc .",
    "the blueshifted structures span a broad range in velocity , while the redshifted structures are more localized in velocity space .",
    "the blueshifted structures also are more centrally concentrated ( at least in projection ) compared to the redshifted structures .",
    "co(2 - 1 ) spectra were extracted for all 24 molecular structures identified in fig . 2 and fit to a gaussian profile . the best - fit mean velocity , linewidth and integrated flux density",
    "are shown in table 1 and the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "3 . for some molecular structures , the signal - to - noise was insufficient to obtain a well constrained fit .",
    "in addition , the spectra of some structures are not well described by a simple gaussian .",
    "for example , see the spectrum of molecular structure 13 in fig .",
    "3 , which has a extended blue wing . for these molecular structures , only the mean velocity and integrated flux density",
    "are listed in table 1 .",
    "the molecular mass was computed using the relation in bolatto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the integrated co ( 1 - 0 ) flux density in units of jy  km  s@xmath3 and @xmath18 is the luminosity distance in units of mpc .",
    "this relation is based on the galactic co - to - h@xmath19 conversion factor of @xmath20  @xmath21  ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 .",
    "we assume a co(2 - 1 ) to co ( 1 - 0 ) flux density ratio of 3.2 to estimate the molecular mass based on the observed co(2 - 1 ) to co ( 1 - 0 ) brightness temperature ratio of 0.8 for molecular clouds in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , braine & combes 1992 ) and the factor of two in frequency .",
    "the molecular masses of the structures range from @xmath0  m@xmath1 ( corresponding to the @xmath14 sensitivity limit ) to @xmath2  m@xmath1 and the linewidths vary from 15 to 65  km  s@xmath3 . while resolved gmcs in the milky way and local group galaxies can have masses up to @xmath2  m@xmath1 , linewidths seldom exceed 10  km  s@xmath3 ( solomon et al .",
    "1987 ; blitz et al .",
    "2006 ; fukui et al .",
    "2008 ; bolatto et al .",
    "2013 ) and we therefore refer to the molecular structures detected in ngc 5044 as giant molecular associations ( gmas ) .",
    "the total molecular mass of the gmas listed in table 1 is @xmath22  m@xmath1 , the mean velocity is @xmath23  km  s@xmath3 and the velocity dispersion is 122  km  s@xmath3 , which is less than the stellar velocity dispersion of 237  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "while there is a significant difference in the number of red and blueshifted gmas , the molecular mass is evenly divided between the red and blueshifted gmas .",
    "this is due to the massive redshifted gma 18 which contains 20% of the total molecular mass .",
    "there are several gmas within the central 1  kpc diameter region that span more than one channel map .",
    "the channel maps suggest the possibility that gmas 13 and 18 are contiguous across the central agn , however the position - velocity diagram in fig .",
    "4 shows that gmas 13 and 18 are distinct molecular structures .",
    "4 also shows that there is no molecular structure with a smooth transition in velocities ( from redshifted to blueshifted ) across the systemic velocity of the galaxy , which would indicate the presence of a central disk .",
    "to further investigate the kinematics of the central gmas we generated velocity maps in two separate velocity slices ( from -100 to 0  km  s@xmath3 and from 0 to 130  km  s@xmath3 ) to prevent projection effects along the line of sight .",
    "5 shows that gmas 11 and 13 have velocities near the systemic velocity of ngc 5044 at large radii and monotonically increasing blueshifted velocities close to the central agn .",
    "the blue shifted emission from gma 13 is also visible in fig .",
    "this suggests that these two gmas are falling into the center of the galaxy from the far side of the galaxy , similar to the situation observed in perseus ( lim et al .",
    "6 shows that the gas velocity in gma 18 increases along a sw to ne direction and suggests that gma 18 is falling into the central region of the galaxy from the near side of the galaxy .",
    "the feature in fig . 6 toward the ne of gma 18 at a velocity of 20  km",
    "s@xmath3 shows up as a separate molecular structure in fig .",
    "the results shown in table 1 were derived by fitting spectra binned into 10  km  s@xmath3 channels .",
    "gma 18 produces 20% of the total flux within the central 2.5  kpc and the signal is strong enough to permit a higher resolution study .",
    "fig . 7 shows a 1  km  s@xmath3 per channel spectrum of gma 18 which clearly shows the presence of two separate components . fitting a double gaussian model yields a mean velocity , linewidth and molecular mass for the narrow - line component of 58.7  km  s@xmath3 , 5.5  km  s@xmath3 and @xmath24  m@xmath1 .",
    "while the molecular mass of the narrow - line component in gma 18 is comparable with some of the lower mass gmas detected in ngc 5044 , the linewidth is much smaller and more typical of an individual gmc ( solomon et al .",

    "we fit 2d gaussians to gmas 11 , 13 and 18 ( the best resolved molecular structures in the center of ngc5044 which also comprise 35% of the total observed    molecular mass ) .",
    "the task _ imfit _ computes the best - fit fwhm along the major and minor axes of the 2d gaussian .",
    "we define the cloud radius as @xmath25 , where @xmath26  fwhm/2.35 , and obtain deconvolved cloud radii of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29  pc for gmas 11 , 13 and 18 , respectively . using these radii and the molecular cloud masses listed in table 1 , we obtain surface mass densities of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32   @xmath33  pc@xmath34 , and @xmath35 volume densities of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xmath39 for gmas 11 , 13 and 18 , respectively . assuming an average density of @xmath40  @xmath39 for true gmcs , the average gmc volume filling factor for the three gmas is 15% .",
    "the virial parameter ,    @xmath41    can be used to determine if a cloud is self - gravitating ( @xmath42 ) or self - gravitating and in virial equilibrium ( @xmath43 ) . for gma 11 and the broad - line component of gma 18 , @xmath44 and 24 , respectively , indicating that these gmas are not self - gravitating .",
    "we do not estimate @xmath4 for gma 13 since its spectrum does not follow a simple gaussian profile . while gma 18 as a whole    is gravitationally unbound , the presence of the narrow - line feature seen in fig .",
    "7 shows that gma 18 contains at least one virialized gmc .",
    "the central agn in ngc 5044 is surprisingly bright in the alma data with a flux density of @xmath45  mjy and luminosity of @xmath46  erg  s@xmath3 measured in a line - free region .",
    "we used the casa task _ imfit _ to confirm that the central emission is consistent with a point source . for comparison , the total flux densities ( central point source plus extended emission ) for 5044 at 235  mhz and 610  mhz from gmrt data are 229  mjy and 39  mjy ( giacintucci et al . 2008 ) .",
    "thus , the 230 ghz luminosity of the central agn is at least 500 times greater than its luminosity at 610  mhz and a factor of a few greater than the bolometric x - ray luminosity ( giacintucci et al .",
    "2008 ; david et al .",
    "as mentioned above , the large number of x - ray cavities within the central region of ngc 5044 are probably due to multiple agn outbursts over the past @xmath47  yrs . the detection of 230  ghz continuum emission from the agn shows that it is presently undergoing another outburst , probably due to a recent accretion event .",
    "it is unlikely that thermal emission from dust makes a substantial contribution to the 230  ghz continuum emission . _",
    "spitzer _ data shows that the 70  @xmath48 dust emission is extended ( temi et al .",

    "( 2007 ) predict a flux density at 230  ghz of less than 1  mjy .",
    "the models in temi et al . assume a steady - state balance between dust production and ion sputtering and include heating from starlight and inelastic collision with thermal electrons .",
    "the fir emissivity was computed by integrating over the local grain size ( and therefore ) temperature distribution .",

    "the line - of - sight velocity is a significant fraction of the circular velocity indicating that the cloud is falling into the central region of the galaxy on a nearly radial orbit .",
    "the optical depth at line center is @xmath51 , indicating that either 30% of the continuum    source is covered by an optically thick cloud or that the entire continuum source is covered by diffuse molecular gas with @xmath51 . due to the presence of faint line emission near the agn",

    "we confirmed this by extracting spectra in several smaller regions and found that 30% of the continuum flux is absorbed at line - center in all spectra .",
    "the linewidth of the absorber is typical of an individual gmc . assuming the linewidth - size relation in solomon et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , we obtain a size for the absorbing cloud of 27  pc , implying that the radius of the continuum emission is less than 50  pc .",

    "fitting a cooling flow model to the acis data within the central region of ngc5044 does not provide useful constraints on the spectroscopic mass deposition rate since the ambient gas temperature is only 0.7  kev and the acis response declines rapidly below 0.5 kev . the cavity power derived in david et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is about one - half of the x - ray luminosity within the    central 10  kpc , but this number depends on the uncertain volume of the cavities . as long as 5% of the hot gas is able to cool , mass deposition from the cooling flow will be the dominant supply mechanism for the molecular gas .    neglecting the suppression of gas cooling by agn feedback , the molecular mass contained within the 24 gmas can be produced by gas cooling within the central 10  kpc in approximately 8  myr . due to the limited sensitivity and coverage in our cycle 0 alma data ,",
    "the 24 gmas we detect is probably a lower limit .",
    "the h@xmath4 and [ c ii ] emission , which traces molecular gas , extend to at least 7  kpc .",
    "the integrated co(2 - 1 ) flux density in the iram 30 m data is significantly greater than that in the alma data ( especially in the blueshifted emission ) which is presumably due to a significant component of diffuse molecular gas that is resolved out in the alma data .",
    "any additional molecular gas or reduction in the mass deposition rate due to agn feedback would require a longer accumulation time for the molecular gas .",
    "there are several indications of infalling molecular gas in ngc 5044 ( i.e. , the absorption feature seen against the central continuum source and the velocity gradients in gmas 11 and 13 ) and no indications of disk - like structures .",
    "the smooth x - ray morphology of the ngc 5044 group on large scales indicates that the gas is in nearly hydrostatic equilibrium , but the observed structure within the central region ( see fig .",
    "11 ) suggests that there is some agn - driven turbulence .",
    "however , the turbulent velocities are probably a small fraction of the sound speed of the hot gas .",
    "turbulent velocities greater than 20 - 40  km  s@xmath3 would generate a heating rate due to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy that exceeds the radiative cooling rate of the hot gas ( david et al .",
    "the linewidth of an individual gma should reflect the turbulent velocity of the hot gas from which it formed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed linewidths of the gmas in ngc 5044 are comparable to that required to balance radiative cooling with the dissipation    of turbulent kinetic energy in the hot gas .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular gas in ngc 5044 are very different from that observed in the more massive clusters a1835 ( mcnamara et al . 2014 ) and a1664 ( russell et al . 2014 ) .",
    "alma cycle 0 observations show that both of these systems have more than @xmath6 of molecular gas .",
    "abell 1664 has a massive central disk - like molecular structure and several high velocity clumps ( @xmath63  km  s@xmath3 ) which could be either infalling or outflowing .",
    "the molecular gas in a1835 is distributed between a nearly face - on disk and a bipolar outflow , possibly driven by radio jets or buoyant x - ray cavities ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2014 ) .    both a1664 and a1835 host much more powerful agns compared to ngc 5044 .",
    "the cavity power in ngc 5044 is @xmath64  erg  s@xmath3 ( david et al .",
    "2009 ) , compared to @xmath65  erg  s@xmath3 in a1664 ( russell et al . 2014 ) and @xmath66  erg  s@xmath3 in a1835",
    "( mcnamara et al . 2014 ) . for buoyancy to have a significant impact on the molecular gas ,",
    "the displaced mass in the x - ray cavities must equal the molecular gas mass .",
    "for ngc 5044 this would require the displacement of all the hot gas within the central 2  kpc , which obviously has not happened ( see fig .",
    "the total displaced gas mass in the cavities seen in fig .",
    "11 is approximately @xmath67 , which is only 15% of the observed molecular gas mass . while an x - ray cavity could still affect the dynamics of an individual gma ,",
    "there is no observed correlation between the velocities of the gmas and their proximity to x - ray cavities .",
    "gmrt observations also show that ngc 5044 does not have a large scale collimated jet ( giacintucci et al . 2011 ) .",
    "thus , due to the presence of only a weak agn in ngc 5044 , we conclude that the molecular gas essentially follows ballistic trajectories after condensing out of the hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "we showed above that gmas 11 and 18 would have to be more than 20 times more massive to be gravitationally bound .",
    "while we can not make a general statement about the entire gma population in ngc 5044 , it is clear that the largest gmas    are not gravitationally bound . from the _ chandra _ acis data we can compute the thermal pressure of the x - ray emitting gas and determine if the gmas are pressure confined .",
    "the thermal pressure of the hot gas in the vicinity of gma 18 is @xmath68  k  @xmath39 , assuming gma 18 is located at a radial distance equal to its projected distance . the co(2 - 1 )",
    "linewidth in gma 18 is approximately 90 times the sound speed of the gas ( assuming a kinetic temperature of 30  k ) , indicating that the pressure in gma 18 is dominated by supersonic turbulence . the turbulent pressure in gma 18 is @xmath69  k  @xmath39 , which is a factor of four greater than the thermal pressure of the surrounding hot gas , suggesting that gma is not pressure confined .",
    "however , even if the computed turbulent pressure was less than the thermal pressure of the hot gas , it is doubtful that gma 18 could be confined by the hot gas .",
    "our estimate for the turbulent pressure assumes that the bulk of gma 18 is filled with gas at the volume - averaged density and that all of this gas has a turbulent velocity equal to the observed co(2 - 1 ) linewidth .",
    "both of these assumptions are probably not valid .",
    "as mentioned above , the volume filling factor of the few resolved gmas is fairly small , so the observed co(2 - 1 ) linewidths should be thought of as the velocity dispersion of the embedded gmcs , each of which has a smaller internal velocity dispersion and higher density . due to the factor of @xmath70 contrast in densities between the embedded gmcs and the x - ray emitting gas ,",
    "the thermal pressure of the hot gas will not decelerate and confine the ballistically moving gmcs within a gma .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that the few resolved gmas in ngc 5044 are confined by either self - gravity or thermal pressure .",
    "individual gmcs will only be dynamically affected by the hot gas after sweeping up a mass equal to their own mass .",
    "typical gmcs have radii of a few pc and must therefore travel a few kpc due to the factor of @xmath70 contrast in density between the cold and hot gas before sweeping up their own mass .",
    "this distance is more than an order of magnitude greater than the largest observed gma .",
    "since the gmas are not confined by self - gravity or thermal pressure , they should disperse in the time it takes a gmc to cross the gma .",
    "given the observed radius and linewidth of gma 18 , embedded gmcs should traverse the gma in a time of @xmath71=12  myr , which is less than the central 40  myr cooling time of the hot gas .",
    "this implies that the embedded gmcs within a gma must condense out of the hot gas at the same time and that the observed gmas in ngc 5044 probably arise from local concentrations of thermally unstable parcels of hot gas .",
    "one possible mechanism for producing a local concentration of cooling parcels of hot gas is the presence of dust , possibly transported outward by agn outbursts as discussed in temi et al .",
    "dust grains accelerate the cooling of the hot gas due to inelastic collisions between the thermal electrons and the dust ( mathews and brighenti et al .",
    "2003 ) . reducing the cooling time of",
    "the gas also helps the non self - gravitating gmas maintain their integrity as they cool .      the star formation rate in ngc 5044 based on _ galex _ and _ wise _ data is 0.073  m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 ( werner et al .",
    "ngc 5044 also has unusual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) line ratios compared to other early - type galaxies ( vega et al .",
    "2010 ) and a highly uncertain stellar age ( marino et al . 2010 ) , both of which may result from episodes of star formation over the past few gyrs .",
    "the depletion time of the molecular gas due to star formation is approximately 700  myr , which is typical for molecular gas in brightest cluster galaxies embedded in cooling flows ( odea et al .",
    "2008 ; voit & donahue 2011 ) , but the iram 30 m data shows that there may be a significant amount of diffuse molecular gas that was undetected in the alma data which would substantially increase the depletion time .",
    "the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation between star formation rate and gas surface density predicts a combined star formation rate from gmas 11 , 13 and 18 of 0.03  m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 . considering that these three gmas comprise about 35% of the observed molecular gas ,",
    "this estimate is in reasonably good agreement with the observed star formation rate . assuming that one type ii supernova ( sneii ) is produced for every 100  m@xmath1 consumed into stars and that each sneii produces @xmath72  erg , the sneii heating rate in gma 18 should be @xmath73  erg  s@xmath3 . if we assume that gma 18 has a lifetime of 12  myr ( i.e. , the crossing time of an individual gmc ) , then a total of @xmath74  erg of energy will be released by sneii during this time , which corresponds to 60% of the turbulent kinetic energy in gma 18 .",
    "thus , depending on the how sneii energy is partitioned between radiative and mechanical energy , sneii could play a role in driving the internal turbulence and dissipation of the gmas .",
    "our alma cycle 0 observation shows that the cooling flow in the x - ray bright group ngc 5044 is a breeding ground for molecular gas .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) emission within the central 2.5  kpc is distributed among 24 molecular structures with a total molecular mass of @xmath75 .",
    "only a few of the molecular structures are spatially resolved and the observed radii , linewidths and masses of the these structures indicate that they are not gravitationally bound .",
    "given the large co(2 - 1 ) linewidths of the structures , they are likely giant molecular associations and not individual clouds . the average density of the few resolved gmas yields a gmc volume filling factor of 15% .",
    "one narrow line component is detected within the largest gma with a linewidth comparable to a virialized gmc .    while the large scale spatial distribution of the gmas is azimuthally symmetric , there are some systematic differences in velocity space .",
    "approximately 20% of the molecular gas is contained in a single massive , redshifted gma near the center of ngc 5044 .",
    "the remainder of the molecular gas is divided between many lower mass gmas with a greater central concentration among the blueshifted gmas compared to the redshifted gmas . on global scales , the kinematics of the molecular gas",
    "is similar to that observed in the h@xmath4 filaments ( caon et al .",
    "2000 ) and [ c ii ] emitting gas ( werner et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "there are no disk - like molecular structures observed in ngc 5044 .",
    "two of the gmas have velocity maps suggesting that they are falling into the center of ngc5044 from the far side of the galaxy .",
    "there is also an absorption feature seen in the co(2 - 1 ) spectrum of the central continuum source with an infalling velocity of 250  km  s@xmath3 and a linewidth typical of an individual gmc . combining these results with the presence of infalling molecular gas in the perseus cluster ( lim et al .",
    "2008 ) suggest that infalling molecular gas is common in cooling flows .",
    "the observed molecular mass and distribution and kinematics of the gmas in ngc 5044 are consistent with a scenario in which the molecular gas condenses out of the thermally unstable hot gas and then follows ballistic trajectories .",
    "agn - inflated buoyant cavities should not have a major impact on the dynamics of the molecular gas as a whole , except possibly in the immediate proximity of an x - ray cavity .",
    "the integrated co(2 - 1 ) flux density in the iram 30 m observation of ngc 5044 is significantly greater than that produced by the molecular structures detected in the alma data .",
    "this is presumably due to a significant component of diffuse molecular gas that has been resolved out in the alma data .",
    "due to the lack of gravitational or pressure confinement , the gmas detected in ngc 5044 should disperse on a timescale of about 12  myr , which is less than the 40  myr central cooling time of the hot gas , so the embedded gmcs within a gma must condense out of the hot gas at the same time .",
    "thus , the observed gmas probably arise from local concentrations of over dense , thermally unstable regions in the hot gas .",
    "the wealth of information obtained from our 30 minute cycle 0 alma observation of the near by ngc 5044 group shows that it is an ideal target for investigating the formation of molecular gas in cooling flows and the long standing question about the ultimate fate of the cooling gas .",
    "more sensitive and higher resolution alma observations in future cycles promise to illuminate the internal structure of the gmas detected in the cycle 0 observation .",
