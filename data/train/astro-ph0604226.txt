    "classical radio galaxies are the quintessential type ii active galactic nuclei ( agn ) : accreting super - massive black holes that have their continuum emission in the uv / optical / nir absorbed by dust , thus primarily giving them the appearance of _ normal _ star - forming galaxies at these wavelengths .",
    "the main evidence that they host super - massive black holes comes from the high luminosities of their radio lobes that are fed by radio jets originating from the host galactic nuclei ( rees 1978 ) .",
    "the lobe spatial extents ( tens of kilo - parsecs ) and the luminosities ( @xmath6whz@xmath7 ) rule out emission from star - formation . to be more precise radio galaxies are franhoff - riley type ii objects with edge - brightened radio lobes . in terms of the orientation unification scheme for agn ( antonucci 1984 ) radio galaxies are analogous to radio loud quasars obscured in the uv / optical / nir .",
    "due to their large radio luminosities , radio galaxies were the predominant way to probe the distant universe until the advent of ultra - deep optical surveys in the last decade .",
    "in fact , radio galaxies were the first galaxies to be found above redshifts 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 (  stern & spinrad ) .",
    "since their first discovery it has been known that the optical hosts of luminous radio sources are primarily giant elliptical ( ge and cd ) galaxies ( matthews  1964 ) . in the more distant universe , indirect evidence that this association remains intact comes from the detection of normal elliptical host galaxies with @xmath8 law light profiles in @xmath9/nicmos observations of high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) at 1@xmath10@xmath11@xmath102 ( pentericci et al . 2001 ; zirm et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the tendency for hzrgs to reside in moderately rich ( proto-)cluster environments ( venemans et al .",
    "2002 ; stern et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the spectacular ( @xmath12100kpc ) luminous  haloes seen around several sources , implying large gas reservoirs ( reuland et al . 2003",
    "; villar - martn et al .",
    "2003 ) ; sub - mm detections of hzrgs , implying violent star formation activity up to @xmath13100m@xmath14yr@xmath7 ( archibald et al . 2001 ; reuland et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and a few direct kinematic measurements of hzrgs ( dey & spinrad 1996 ) . the most compelling evidence of this association of hzrgs with the most massive systems , however , is the tight correlation of the observed near - infrared hubble , or @xmath15 diagram for powerful radio sources ( de breuck et al .",
    "2002 , rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "2004 ) : hzrgs form a narrow redshift sequence which traces the envelope of radio - quiet galaxies and is well - modeled by the evolution of a stellar population formed at high redshift from a reservoir of @xmath16m@xmath14 . with the more recent discovery that the stellar bulge and central black hole masses of galaxies are closely correlated , it is no longer a surprise that the parent galaxies of the most powerful radio sources occupy the upper end of the galaxy mass function ( maggorian 1998 ; tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "the peak of the stellar emission at @xmath17 of elliptical galaxies has been found to be a reasonably robust measure of the stellar mass for old passively evolving systems .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio at this wavelength does not vary greatly for ages @xmath18 1gyr .",
    "spitzer space telescope _ now allows us to observe this feature in distant sources in the rest frame .",
    "in particular the four bands of the irac instrument and the irs @xmath19 peak - up imager straddle the rest frame @xmath20 flux density at @xmath21@xmath11@xmath22 .      in order to investigate the formation and evolution of the most massive galaxies we have performed a _",
    "survey of 70 hzrgs in go cycle 1 .",
    "these hzrgs have also been carefully chosen to cover the full range of redshifts from @xmath23 to the redshift of the highest known radio galaxy ( @xmath24 ) and two orders of magnitude in radio luminosity , preferentially selecting targets with supporting data from @xmath9 , _ chandra _ and scuba / mambo . by covering this parameter space , any trends with radio luminosity or redshift",
    "should be apparent .",
    "the observations consist of photometry in eight bands from the three instruments aboard _",
    "spitzer _ , exercising the full complement of imaging capabilities ( irac : 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath25 ; irs : @xmath26 ; mips : 24 , 70 and @xmath27 ) . due to uncertainty in the ability of mips to image against the galactic infrared background at the time of submission of go cycle 1 , we chose only to image 26/70 hzrgs with mips .",
    "the other 54 sources have been applied to be observed in _",
    "the irs images are only for the 46 objects above @xmath28 as below this redshift the @xmath29 irac channel adequately covers the longward side of the @xmath30 bump .",
    "the shizrag team keep track of this project through a private webpage which we intend to make public eventually .",
    "currently a restricted version of the webpage is available here :    http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/seymour/shizrags.html",
    "in order to determine the @xmath30 stellar luminosity , the contribution at this wavelength from hot , agn heated dust needs to be ascertained . we have performed this analysis for the sample of 17 mips hzrgs which have @xmath31 detections as well irac observations . for the modeling presented here",
    "we have chosen to use just the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the principle reason is that shorter wavelengths , the rest - frame optical , are more likely to have significant contributions from young stellar populations , emission lines , and agn continuum .",
    "we model the observed 3.6 to @xmath31 data using an elliptical stellar template and three black - bodies .",
    "the elliptical stellar sed is taken from the pgase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) software and corresponds to a passively evolving @xmath32 stellar population formed at @xmath33 ; for each redshift a template of the correct age was chosen although the sed does not evolve significantly after 1gyr ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the three black - bodies where chosen to be at 60k ( analogous to the temperature of cold dust found from sub - mm observations ) , 250k and 600 - 1200k .",
    "this last value was allowed to vary and the best temperature from the fitting applied .",
    "full details of this modeling are presented in seymour  ( _ in prep .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the _ spitzer _ observations and the sed modeling for one representative source , 4c23.56 at @xmath35 .",
    "the best fit hot dust temperature is 750k and one can see that the 1.6@xmath25 stellar peak has considerable agn contamination . a more detailed analysis of the broad - band , x - ray to radio sed of 4c23.56 is presented in de breuck  ( _ in prep .",
    ".    the other 53 hzrgs with no mips detections can at least provide upper limits to the stellar luminosities and , in some cases only the upper limits come from detections only in irac channels 1 and 2 .",
    "so we fit a maximum elliptical template sed to the irac data . in some case",
    "the elliptical template fits quite well to irac channels 1 - 3 and in others the sed is steeply rising at the longer wavelengths and the fit is restricted only by channel 1 . in the former case",
    "the we calculate a nominal stellar mass from the fit , but in the latter we may only derive upper limits .      the derived rest - frame , agn - subtracted , 1.6@xmath25 stellar luminosities are shown against redshift in fig .",
    "3 ( top ) for all our hzrgs . also laid on the plot by a solid line is the stellar luminosity of a @xmath32 elliptical galaxy .",
    "the stellar luminosities imply stellar masses in the range @xmath36 with a mean mass of @xmath3 ( fig",
    ". 3 bottom ) .",
    "this mean mass remains consistent out to @xmath4 ( beyond which the parameter space becomes less well sampled ) suggesting that the upper end of the mass function is already in place by at least @xmath4 .",
    "figure 3 shows the rest 6.75@xmath25 luminosity against the rest 3ghz luminosity for the 18 radio galaxies with mips observations .",
    "the wavelength of 6.75@xmath25 was chosen as a fiducial mid - ir wavelength as it is the mean rest wavelength of the observed mips 24@xmath25 band for our sample and also the wavelength of the lw2 filter from isocam , allowing a direct comparison of derived luminosities .",
    "it is clear to first approximation that the two luminosities correlate and by implication have a common origin .",
    "this correlation makes sense if the radio luminosity comes from lobes induced by a jet from the agn and the mid - ir comes from hot agn - heated dust .",
    "the mid - ir luminosities are also all greater than @xmath37 implying bolometric luminosities on ulirg scales assuming local relations hold for these objects .",
    "these radio galaxies tend to have a higher mean mid - ir to radio luminosity ratio then those selected at lower redshift ,  ogle  ( 2006 ) finds that @xmath5 radio galaxies tend to have @xmath38 .",
    "we have presented a stellar - luminosity / redshift relation of hzrgs , a more physical representation of the @xmath15 diagram . this distribution seems to confirm the long held paradigm that radio galaxies are hosted by massive ellipticals out to high redshifts , and that the most massive galaxies are already in place by redshift 4 and possibly earlier .",
    "we also observe a correlation between the infrared and radio luminosities which is unsurprising if they are both fueled by the agn .",
    "current on - going work includes mm / sub - mm observations with scuba , mambo and the cso to constrain the cold dust component at longer wavelengths and hence estimate the mass of this cold dust . over - densities of sources around radio galaxies",
    "are being investigated to look for evidence of cluster formation ( zirm _ in prep .",
    "over half the sources with @xmath31 images have over - densities of factors of 2 - 5 greater than that expected from 24@xmath25 source counts .",
    "these radio galaxies mainly lie at @xmath39 where the strong @xmath40 pah feature passes though the 24@xmath25 mips band , enhancing the 24@xmath25 flux density .",
