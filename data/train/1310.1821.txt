    "our goal is to compute the maslov index for non - autonomous , symplectic , linear differential operators of the form @xmath1 with domain the real line @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath3 , the symplectic lie algebra of real @xmath4 matrices .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case when @xmath5 is large .",
    "we assume that the matrix @xmath6 is constant in the far - field limits of the domain @xmath2 ( the two limits need not be the same ) .",
    "the maslov index is an integer valued topological invariant that measures the following occurances .",
    "consider the set of ( necessarily ) @xmath5 solutions that decay exponentially fast , say , to the left far - field .",
    "these solutions constitute a path of frames , indeed a path in the stiefel manifold of symplectic frames @xmath7 .",
    "each frame spans a plane in the manifold of lagrangian planes @xmath8 known as the lagrangian grassmannian .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "we evolve the lagrangian plane from the left far - field towards the right far - field and count the number of intersections this lagrangian plane path has with a given reference plane .",
    "the dimension of each intersection generates the multiplicity contribution to the maslov index , and the direction of passage generates its sign contribution .",
    "there are various equivalent ways to formulate the definition of the maslov index more precisely , and we refer to @xcite for more details . this picture can be succinctly summarized in terms of cohomological classes of paths ; see arnold  @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations for studying operators of the form @xmath10 is that they arise in the context of eigenvalue problems associated with the stability of solutions of travelling waves .",
    "for example , suppose one is interested in determining the qualitative behaviour of solutions of the reaction - diffusion system @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a diagonal matrix of positive diffusion coefficients .",
    "a key step is to determine the existence of any stationary solutions , say @xmath14 , and their stability properties .",
    "the reason is that stable solutions attract nearby data and therefore provide a qualitative description of the types of behaviours that one would expect to observe as the system evolves . in order to determine",
    "if @xmath15 is stable , one can linearize the reaction - diffusion system about @xmath15 to obtain @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the potential .",
    "in general , a necessary condition for @xmath15 to be stable is that the spectrum of this linear operator , in an appropriate function space such as @xmath18 , be contained in the closed left half plane .",
    "the most difficult part of the spectrum to analyze is typically the point spectrum , or eigenvalues , which can be determined by studying @xmath19 we assume @xmath20 is selfadjoint and set @xmath21 .",
    "then if we set @xmath22 we can rewrite this eigenvalue problem as a first order system ( hereafter @xmath23 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the corresponding symplectic coefficient matrix .",
    "eigenvalues then correspond to values of @xmath26 for which solutions @xmath27 exist that decay to zero as @xmath28 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is equivalent to requiring that the solution lie in the intersection of two particular lagrangian subspaces , namely the stable and unstable manifolds associated with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "thus , being able to determine such intersections , via the maslov index ( and a matrix riccati equation as we will see ) , would provide insight into the stability of @xmath15 .",
    "such a framework is not limited to reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "it also applies to a variety of other examples , including higher - order equations such as the dispersive kdv equation .",
    "see section  [ sec : example ] and examples in chardard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is a large body of existing literature on determining the spectral properties of the types of linear operators mentioned above .",
    "perhaps the most widely used tool is the evans function ( alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite , sandstede  @xcite , deng and nii  @xcite , sandstede and oh  @xcite ) , which is constructed for systems governed by operators of the form @xmath10 .",
    "the use of the maslov index in such contexts is relatively recent ; see jones  @xcite , chardard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , deng and jones  @xcite , jones _",
    "et al . _",
    "a limitation of the majority of these results is that they apply only to problems in one spatial dimension . as a result",
    ", there has been recent interest in developing techniques that apply to arbitrary spatial dimensions .",
    "notable steps in this direction include deng and nii  @xcite and sandstede and oh  @xcite , involving the evans function , and deng and jones  @xcite , involving the maslov index .",
    "however , there has not yet been an application of these abstract results to concrete examples , where the stability of a specific stationary solution is actually computed .",
    "one potential consequence of this current work is to provide a mechanism to do just that .",
    "much of the theoretical framework herein in principle applies to arbitrary symplectic hilbert spaces , such as those of the multidimensional case considered in deng and jones  @xcite .",
    "indications of this are given in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "intuitively , the maslov index can provide information about stability in the following way .",
    "consider the reaction - diffusion system above with @xmath31 .",
    "this is just a sturm - liouville problem , and it can be recast in terms of prfer coordinates , which are polar coordinates for @xmath27 .",
    "one can then determine the dynamics of the phase and prove a so - called oscillation theorem .",
    "this says that , as the eigenvalue parameter is increased , the amount of oscillation in the phase of the corresponding solution decreases .",
    "one thus obtains a result concerning the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath32 and corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath33 , which says that @xmath34 has exactly @xmath35 zeros .",
    "this is particularly useful when @xmath10 arises from a system such as the reaction - diffuson system above by linearizing about the stationary solution @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", @xmath36 is an eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue @xmath37 . if , for example , @xmath15 is a pulse then @xmath38 has exactly one zero .",
    "hence , there is exactly one eigenvalue with positive real part and the wave is spectrally unstable . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath15 is a front then the linearization has no positive eigenvalues and the wave is spectrally stable .",
    "the maslov index can be thought of as a higher - dimensional analogue of this oscillation index that applies to a more general class of equations .",
    "the winding , or oscillation , in the general case comes from the fact that the fundamental group of the space of lagrangian planes is @xmath39 .",
    "note that the maslov index and the evans function provide stability information in a fundamentally different way .",
    "the latter is an analytic function whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues , and thus in principle one can locate the eigenvalues by locating its zeros .",
    "the former , however , allows one to count , but not locate , the eigenvalues .",
    "computing the maslov index associated with @xmath10 will in general involve numerical integration .",
    "recently chardard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated how to numerically compute the malsov index for solitary waves . to circumvent the inherent numerical instabilities associated with computing the path of symplectic frames where the frame vectors have distinct exponential growth rates , chardard _ et al .",
    "_ lifted the path in the stiefel manifold of symplectic frames @xmath7 to a path in the symplectic exterior algebra @xmath40 .",
    "this path has a single exponential growth rate that can be scaled out and can be robustly numerically computed .",
    "the number of parameters required to represent @xmath40 is @xmath41 choose @xmath5 , which grows exponentially with @xmath5 .",
    "the plcker relations between the parameters can be used to reduce the dimension of the system .",
    "a natural resolution is to apply the ortho - symplectic integration proposed by chardard _",
    "et al . _ or",
    "indeed a symplectic version of the continuous orthogonalization method proposed by humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite .    here",
    "we pursue another natural approach which utilizes the principle fibre bundle structure @xmath42 .",
    "indeed we project @xmath7 onto the lagrangian grassmannian @xmath8 by equivalencing by all general linear real rank @xmath5 transformations @xmath43 .",
    "following ledoux _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the flow governed by @xmath10 on @xmath7 induces a riccati flow in a given chart and top cell @xmath44 of the lagrangian grassmannian @xmath8 .",
    "the riccati flow exhibits singularities but these just indicate the chart chosen @xmath44 is no longer the best representative chart .",
    "however , crucially , when integrating riccati equations in the context of eigenvalue problems as described above , indeed for non - selfadjoint problems , veerle ledoux recognized that the location ( in the complex spectral parameter plane ) of singularities in the components of the riccati solution converged to eigenvalues in the far - field limit .",
    "see ledoux and malham  @xcite and aljasser  @xcite for more details .",
    "our results here clarify and confirm these observations in the symplectic context .",
    "note that the lagrangian grassmannian chart @xmath44 is isomorphic to vector space of real symmetric matrices , and the cayley map is a diffeomorphism from the space of real symmetric matrices to the manifold of unitary symmetric nonsingular matrices ( see section  [ sec : prelim ] ) . from arnold",
    "@xcite we know the logarithm of the determinant of the cayley map measures the angle of the langrangian plane to the reference plane .",
    "what we prove that is new is :    1 .",
    "the number of singular eigenvalues in the riccati flow on @xmath44 equals the dimension of intersection with the reference plane , which equals the unsigned integer jump in the maslov index ; 2 .",
    "the logarithm of the cayley map equals the arctan map ( modulo @xmath0 ) and its trace computes the angle between the evolving langrangian and reference planes .",
    "hence in principle we could push forward the riccati flow under the arctan map and monitor its trace ; 3 .",
    "the riccati flow under the cayley map induces a flow in the manifold of unitary symmetric nonsingular matrices . using the natural unitary action on this manifold",
    ", we pullback the flow to the unitary lie algebra and monitor its trace .",
    "this avoids singularities , and is a natural robust procedure for monitoring the maslov index .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prelim ] we fix our notation , define the lagrangian grassmannian and introduce known results that we will need .",
    "we briefly discuss in section  [ sec : tfm ] the well - known method of changing coordinates to standardize the reference lagrangian plane we seek intersections with . in section  [ sec : riccati ] we derive the riccati flow prescribing the evolution by @xmath10 of a lagrangian plane and establish the connection between singularities in the flow and intersections with the reference plane .",
    "we provide the details of how to pull back the flow to the unitary lie algebra in section  [ sec : unitaryriccati ] .",
    "we compute the maslov index for a large ( high order ) eigenvalue problem in section  [ sec : example ] and demonstrate the computational advantages of the methods we have derived / propose . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we discuss the extension to the infinite dimensional case .",
    "we introduce the objects of our study and fix our notion as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , the usual symplectic , general linear , orthogonal and unitary lie groups of rank @xmath5 matrices over the fields indicated .",
    "we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 to denote the corresponding symplectic and unitary lie algebras .",
    "we denote by :    * @xmath7 , the stiefel manifold of symplectic @xmath5-frames in @xmath51 ; * @xmath8 , the lagrangian grassmann manifold of @xmath5-planes in @xmath51 ; * @xmath52 , the manifold of unitary symmetric nonsingular matrices in @xmath53 .",
    "our subsequent analysis mainly involves these standard lie groups and homogeneous manifolds .",
    "some of the important relations between them are summarized in the following diagram .",
