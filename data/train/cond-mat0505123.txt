    "superconductor is a substance that below a certain temperature ( critical temperature @xmath4 ) conducts charge current without resistance and also repels the magnetic field .",
    "superconductivity was discovered by kammerlingh onnes in a mercury wire at temperatures less than @xmath5 in 1911 @xcite . in 1957 ,",
    "bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) , using the concept of cooper pairs , proposed a microscopic theory for superconductivity @xcite .",
    "cooper had shown earlier that the ground state of a metal , at sufficient low temperatures , will be stable when its electrons are collected as the pairs @xcite .",
    "bcs theory suggests that cooper pairs at low temperatures condense into the same quantum state defined by a macroscopic wave function and can travel together without dissipation .",
    "also , the pair amplitude of this wave function as an order parameter in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity , defines the transition between normal and superconducting states @xcite . in the limit of @xmath6 , the gl order parameter ,",
    "is directly proportional to the bcs energy gap , @xmath7 , which is the amount of energy for breaking a cooper pair .",
    "this energy gap carries the information about the pairing symmetry of the electrons .",
    "there are different types of superconductivity .",
    "according to the spin states of two electrons in the cooper pair , superconductor is either spin - singlet or spin - triplet .",
    "since electrons are fermion , the total wave function of a cooper pair should be antisymmetric with respect to electrons : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are spatial coordinates and spins , respectively . for the antisymmetric spin - singlet state ,",
    "the orbital part of the wave function should be symmetric under the interchange of the electrons and the orbital momentum should be even ( @xmath11 , @xmath12wave , @xmath13 , @xmath14wave and @xmath15 , @xmath16wave).the superconductors with simplest spin - singlet state , @xmath11 , are known as conventional superconductors .",
    "all the other type of superconductors including the spin - singlet and spin - triplet with @xmath17 , are unconventional superconductors .",
    "a @xmath12wave superconductor , has an isotropic order parameter @xmath18 in the momentum space , where @xmath19 is a unit vector pointed on the fermi surface .",
    "earlier superconductors which had been found in the elements like mercury , are conventional superconductors .",
    "unconventional superconducting compounds which have anisotropic order parameter can be defined using the relation @xmath20 with summation over the fermi surface . for the symmetric spin - triplet state ,",
    "the orbital part of the wave function is antisymmetric and the orbital momentum takes the odd numbers ( @xmath21 , @xmath22wave , @xmath23 , @xmath2wave and @xmath24 , @xmath25wave ) . here",
    ", the terms @xmath12wave , @xmath22wave and _ etc _ have been used from the terminology of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the pairing state of a spin - triplet superconductor in the spin space is represented by a three dimensional vector @xmath26 , called gap vector .",
    "the gap vector determines the order parameter matrix , @xmath27 , in which @xmath28s are pauli matrices.three complex components of gap vector ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) over the fermi surface are corresponding to three possible spin directions as follow : latexmath:[$|spin\\rangle=(d_1+id_2)|\\hspace{-.1cm}\\downdownarrows\\rangle+ ( -d_1+id_2)|\\hspace{-.1cm}\\upuparrows\\rangle+ d_3(|\\hspace{-.1cm}\\uparrow\\hspace{-.08cm}\\downarrow\\rangle+    many experimental and theoretical works in the case of spin - triplet superconductors from which some important properties of spin - triplet superconductors are listed below:1 ) the spin - triplet superconductors are generally low @xmath4 superconductors , as compared with the high @xmath4 superconductivity in @xmath14wave superconductors @xcite.2 ) the relation between critical temperature and energy gap at zero temperature is different from that of the bcs relation for a @xmath12wave superconductor @xmath33 @xcite.3 ) in structures with spin - triplet superconductivity a spin supercurrent can flow generally , while in the case of the spin - singlet superconductivity , the spin current may exist only in the proximity system of the superconductor and a ferromagnet .",
    "this means that in the spin - triplet superconductors not only the charge but also the spin of electrons can become superfluid @xcite.4 ) ferromagnetic superconductivity is another interesting phenomenon of spin - triplet state . it had been observed that all conventional superconductors were non - magnetic materials and it was concluded that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are incompatible phases . while , ferromagnetic superconductivity has been observed recently , in some of the triplet superconductors like : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite.5 ) nonunitary gap vector is another fingerprint of the spin - triplet superconductivity . in the nonunitary spin - triplet state ,",
    "cooper pairs may carry a finite averaged intrinsic spin momentum .",
    "this nonunitary state is a candidate for the @xmath37phase of superconductivity in the @xmath38 compound ( fig.[figrev3 ] ) .",
    "this phase has been observed at the low temperatures and low magnetic fields @xcite.6 ) in addition to the temperature and magnetic field , pressure influences the phase transition of triplet superconductors , particularly for the ferromagnetic superconductors @xcite.7 ) another property of some of triplet superconductors in the similarity of their structures with some of the important high @xmath4 superconductors .",
    "for example , the @xmath39 spin - triplet superconductor is isostructural to the spin - singlet high - temperature superconductor @xmath40 here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 atoms are counterpart of @xmath43 and @xmath44 atoms , respectively .",
    "consequently , investigation of this triplet superconductor helps to understand the singlet case @xcite.we have to introduce some of unconventional superconducting compounds , particularly those which will be investigated in the following chapters of this work .",
    "the uranium compound @xmath38 will be studied in chapter ( [ spincharge ] ) and ( [ nonunitary ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath45 and @xmath46 compounds will be investigated in chapters ( [ spincharge ] ) and ( [ prossb ] ) , respectively .",
    "the first discovered triplet order parameter , @xmath22wave pairing symmetry , has been observed in the helium superfluid .",
    "also , @xmath22wave order parameter has been considered as a candidate for the superconducting state in @xmath45 by some authors @xcite .",
    "a famous form of @xmath22wave pairing symmetry in momentum space is @xmath47 in which , @xmath48 is a unit vector @xcite .",
    "another important category of triplet superconductors is @xmath2wave superconductivity , proposed for the pairing symmetry in heavy - fermion compound @xmath38 in @xcite and the compound @xmath45 in @xcite .",
    "the different phases of @xmath2wave superconductivity have different order parameter symmetries in momentum space .",
    "for instance , the @xmath2wave axial state symmetry is @xmath49 @xcite and the planar state has the form @xmath50 , where , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath48 are the unit vectors @xcite . in this work",

    "the function @xmath58 @xmath59 describes the dependence of the gap vector @xmath60 on the temperature @xmath61@xcite .",
    "the second model to describe the gap vector of the @xmath62-phase of @xmath46 is : @xmath63@xcite .",
    "one of the most important types of unconventional superconductivity has been observed in the high @xmath4 superconductor in the ceramic of copper oxide by bednorz and mller @xcite .",
    "this spin - singlet superconductor has a @xmath14wave pairing symmetry , @xmath13 , as @xmath64 or @xmath65 in momentum space .",
    "this discovery was a real revolution in the field of superconductivity .",
    "conventional and unconventional superconductors are usually differentiated by several properties such as anisotropicity of the order parameter in the momentum space , heat capacity and heat conductance , density of states , junction behavior and particularly nodes in the momentum space .",
    "node is a direction in the momentum space where no order parameter and superconductivity is effective on the scattering electrons .",
    "one of the most interesting concepts in the field of superconductivity is , superconducting weak link .",
    "the weak link experiments are classified in the categories of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , in which two superconducting bulks have been separated by a nonsuperconducting interface or point - contact . here ,",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote superconductor , insulator , normal metal and point - contact respectively .",
    "the weakness of the link means that the superconducting order parameters are the same as the disconnected massive superconducting bulks .",
    "the first configuration had been investigated by josephson , in which a thin insulator is located between the two superconducting bulks . in the second case ,",
    "a normal layer has been sandwiched by two superconducting bulks .",
    "the third experiment is devoted to the geometry consisting two superconducting bulks which are separated by an impenetrable interface ( strong insulator ) in which a contact has been prepared for the mixing of two superconducting states .",
    "josephson effect , @xmath66 , has been investigated in 1962 by josephson @xcite .",
    "he predicted an electrical current flowing between two superconductors while they are separated by an insulator .",
    "this insulator layer is very thin and electrons can pass through it , even with the energies less than height of potential barrier of insulator .",
    "the flow of current between the superconductors in the absence of an applied voltage is called a josephson current ( there is a phase difference instead of the applied voltage ) and the motion of electrons across the barrier is called josephson tunneling . this tunneling phenomenon ,",
    "josephson effect , can be used in the electronic devices such as superconducting quantum interference device ( * squid * ) , for detecting the very small magnetic flux ( even a flux quantum ) .",
    "the josephson effect can be influenced by the external magnetic fields through the external phase difference .",
    "consequently , the josephson junction can be applied to measure the extremely weak magnetic fields , in * squid*. the current which flows , ( quantum mechanically tunnels through the potential barrier of the interface , has a form @xmath73 in which , @xmath0 is the macroscopic phase difference between two superconductors and the critical current @xmath74 depends on the geometry of system ( junction ) .",
    "the josephson effect is a weak link of two massive banks of superconductor , @xmath75 and @xmath76 with different phases @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are separated by an insulator .",
    "the system allows electron to exchange between the two sides of the interface and then establishes the phase coherence in the system as a hole .",
    "the josephson junction can be considered as the mixer between the superconducting quantum macroscopic states .",
    "the result of mixing is the supercurrent which flows from one of the banks to the other and it depends on the phase difference @xmath79 across the weak link .",
    "the function @xmath80 depends on the geometry of the system . in the simplest case which had been studied by josephson ,",
    "the current has a sinusoidal dependence on the phase but there are many different kinds of the weak links in which the current phase diagrams are not sinusoidal .",
    "one of the most famous problems in this category is problem of kulik - omelyanchouk ( @xmath68 junction ) which has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "they have used the eilenberger equation @xcite and using the green function they have obtained the current - phase diagrams analytically .",
    "the current phase relation depends not only on the manner of coupling but also on the properties of the supercondcuting bulks .",
    "two coupled unconventional supercondcuting massive bulks have totaly different current - phase relation from the conventional superconductivity which was studied by josephson and later by kulik and omelyanchouk .",
    "for instance @xmath81 weak link which is a special type of @xmath68 system , in which @xmath82 denotes the @xmath14wave and high @xmath4 superconducting bulks and @xmath72 is the contact , has some new results .",
    "the spontaneous current parallel to the junction interface , mid - gap states resulting from the sign change of the order parameter , and the changing period of current @xmath80 to @xmath83 are different and new results of weak link between unconventional superconducting bulks .",
    "in addition , it is observed that the josephson junction depends not only on the external josephson phase difference resulting form the external magnetic flux but also on the misorientation angle between two superconducting crystals . in this work , because of similarity between our problem and problem of kulik - omelyanchouk , we use the generalized form of their formalism .",
    "this thesis consists of three parts . at first , we are to investigate coherent current states in the superconducting weak link which has been subjected to the josephson phase difference @xmath0 and subjected to the external transport supercurrent state ( parallel to the junction interface ) in the banks .",
    "earlier it had been observed that at @xmath84 close to @xmath85 the mixing of current states produces two vortices in the vicinity of the point - contact between superconducting bulks @xcite . in this part",
    "we study the effect of transparency coefficient ( potential barrier ) of the point - contact in an impenetrable interface and effect of temperature on the vortices obtained in the paper @xcite.the second part of this dissertation is devoted to the weak link between unitary triplet superconductors .",
    "these superconductors have @xmath2wave and @xmath3wave pairing symmetry .",
    "the former has been proposed for @xmath38 and @xmath45 compounds and the later case is considered in @xmath86 complex . the spin - current in the junction between these unitary triplet superconductors is an important part of this work .",
    "the interesting case which is observed in the second part of the thesis , is the polarization of the spin transport using the junction between unitary triplet superconducting bulks .",
    "the third and last part of the thesis discusses the case of weak link between non - unitary triplet superconductors .",
    "the idea behind the first part of the thesis is suitability of this structure ( vortex - like currents ) for the investigation of the quantum macroscopic phenomena .",
    "for the real system the finite transparency coefficient ( finite reflection ) which we have investigated is more suitable than ideal transparent point - contact which had been considered in @xcite .",
    "the second part of the thesis discusses the case of the junction between unitary triplet @xmath2wave and @xmath3wave superconductors .",
    "first of all we know that the triplet superconductors also the high @xmath4 superconductors are created by a different mechanism of pairing than the phonon - electron interaction .",
    "secondly , the molecular structure of the ruthenate compound @xmath45 is the same as that of the high @xmath4 cupperate superconductors which are important superconductors and we are interested to understand their properties .",
    "also , the spin polarized transport has a valuable motivation for physicist in the field of spintornics because , the sensitivity and accuracy of the polarized spin - current systems can be used in the measurement technology .",
    "the second part of this work can be used to develop the theory of spin - polarized transport systems .",
    "the spin transport in the absence of the charge transport is an interesting case to investigate .",
    "the third part of the work has been devoted to non - unitary weak links which has intrinsic spin and angular momentum of systems .    the method for investigation of these weak link experiments is the quasiclassical method of green function .",
    "this method had been used by kulik and omelyanchouk in paper @xcite .",
    "they have studied junction through the point - contact between two static conventional superconducting bulks , but , here we have applied this formalism for the case of conventional superconducting bulks with the external transport current in the banks .",
    "also , we have generalized the kulik - omelyanchouk formalism for the case of triplet supercondcuting bulks .",
    "we have calculated the analytical green s function and then we have used that to obtain the current density .",
    "the current - phase diagrams are plotted and in some cases the two dimensional profile of the current has been plotted in the space .",
    "arrangement of the rest of this thesis is as follows . in chapter ( [ introduction ] ) , we review of the concepts which we use in the rest of the thesis .",

    "the kulik - omelyanchouk problem , that is the ballistic point contact between two superconducting massive bulks will be studied and their results will be reproduced . the effect of transparency coefficient for a point contact with finite reflection in the impenetrable interface between two bulks ( related to our problem in the chapter ( [ vortex ] ) ) will be investigated and some analytical relations for this system will be obtained .",
    "the josephson junction between two unitary superconductors will also be studied in chapter ( [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we will generalize this approach in the chapters ( [ spincharge ] ) , ( [ prossb ] ) and ( [ nonunitary ] ) .",
    "+ a josephson effect in the ballistic point contact with transport current on the banks , taking into account the reflection of electrons from the contact , will be investigated in chapter ( [ vortex ] ) . the contact is subject to the phase difference @xmath84 and the transport current tangential to the boundary of the contact . as it was shown in @xcite , in the contact with direct conductivity at @xmath87 and near the orifice the tangential current flows in the opposite direction to the transport current , and there are two vortices .",
    "it is found that by decreasing the transparency , the vortex - like current will be destroyed . on the other hand , as the temperature",
    "is increased the vortices are restored .",

    "when two superconducting bulks are connected to each other by an insulator from which the electrons can tunnel , we have a weak link .",
    "the weakness of the link means that the superconducting order parameters have their value in the bulks and they are the same as the disconnected massive superconducting reservoirs .",
    "the josephson effect arises in a weak link of two separated ( by insulator ) superconducting bulks with different phases .",
    "the electrons can be exchanged between two superconducting bulks and the system ( two bulks and contact ) tends to be the phase coherent . mixing the superconducting states through the contact or link",
    "causes the supercurrent from one of the banks to the other bank .",
    "the current is present because of the phase difference between the bulks and this phenomenon can be observed in the absence of any voltage .",
    "the phase difference between the bulks which plays a central role in the weak link phenomena can be the result of the external magnetic field which is surrounded by the junction and bulks .",
    "the josephson phase is a kind of the aharonov - bohm phase @xcite .",
    "this phase is related to the magnetic flux which flows from the system as @xmath92 , where , @xmath93 is the quantum of flux and @xmath94 is the vector potential .",
    "the current in the junction which is a supercurrent and is called josephson current can be calculated from @xmath95 , in which , the @xmath96 is the energy of the junction . in the next sections we review some of these weak link experiments analytically .",

    "furthermore , as an interesting and new result , it is observed that the different models of the gap vectors and geometries can be applied for the polarization of the spin transport .",
    "another result of these calculations is the state in which the currents select one of the two possible directions ( perpendicular and parallel to the interface ) to flow .",
    "this property can be used as a switch to control the direction of the charge and spin current . finally , it is observed that at some certain values of the phase difference @xmath84 , the charge - current vanishes while the spin - current flows , although the carriers of both spin and charge are the same ( electrons ) .",
    "the spatial variation of the phase of the order parameter plays a role as the origin of the charge current and , similarly , due to a spatial difference of the gap vectors in two half - spaces causes spin currents .",
    "this is because there is a position - dependent phase difference between `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' cooper pairs and , although the total charge current vanishes , there can be a net transfer of the spin .",
    "therefore , in our system , there is a discontinuous jump between the gap vectors and , consequently the spin currents should generally be present .",
    "for instance , if spin - up states and spin - down states have a velocity in the opposite directions , the charge currents cancel each other whereas the spin current is being transported . mathematically speaking , @xmath546",
    ", so it is possible to find the state in which one of these current terms is zero and the other term has a finite value @xcite . in addition , the spin imbalance which is the result of the different density of states for `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' can be other reason of spin current @xcite . in conclusion , the spin current in the absence of the charge current can be observed .",
    "+ also , the weak link between two misorientated @xmath46 superconducting bulks has been investigated in chapter ( [ prossb ] ) of this thesis .",
    "we have considered the transportation of the spin and charge in the ballistic josephson junction between two @xmath46 crystals with  @xmath54wave \" pairing symmetry which are subject to a phase difference @xmath84 .",
    "in this case as same as the case of @xmath2wave junctions in chapter ( [ spincharge ] ) , the different misorientations and different models of the gap vectors influence the spin and charge currents and it is shown that the misorientation of the superconductors leads to a spontaneous phase difference that corresponds to the zero josephson current .",
    "this phase difference depends on the misorientation angle .",
    "a spontaneous charge current tangential to the interface which is not equal to zero in the absence of the josephson current is observed in this junction .",
    "it has been obtained that the spin current is the result of the misorientation between the gap vectors which is the characteristic of unitary triplet superconductors . again in this case as same as the case of @xmath2wave superconductors , it is observed that the certain model of the gap vectors and geometries can be applied to polarize of the spin transport .",
    "finally , it is observed that at some certain values of the phase difference @xmath84 , the charge - current vanishes while the spin - current flows .",
    "the reason for this case is the above - mentioned discussion for @xmath2wave .",
    "the spin and charge currents can be used to recognize the @xmath55phase and @xmath37phase of  @xmath54wave \" and the pure @xmath22wave pairing symmetry and can be used to determine the pairing symmetry .",
    "particularly , this proposed experiment can be used to demonstrate the  @xmath54wave \" pairing symmetry for which many doubts and challenges exist .",
    "+ finally , in chapter ( [ conclusions ] ) , we have theoretically studied the charge currents in the ballistic josephson junction in the model of an ideal transparent interface between two misoriented @xmath38 crystals with nonunitary bipolar @xmath2wave superconducting bulks which are subject to a phase difference @xmath84 . our analysis has shown that misorientation between the gap vectors create a current parallel to the interface and the different misorientations between gap vectors influence the spontaneous parallel and normal josephson currents .",
    "these have been shown for the currents in the point contact between two bulks of unitary axial and planar @xmath90-wave superconductor in @xcite separately .",
    "also , it is shown that the misorientation of the superconductors leads to a spontaneous phase difference that corresponds to the zero josephson current and to the minimum of the weak link energy in the presence of the finite spontaneous current .",
    "this phase difference depends on the misorientation angle . again in this case , the tangential spontaneous charge current is not equal to zero in the absence of the josephson current .",
    "the difference between junction behavior of unitary planar and nonunitary bipolar superconductivity can be used to distinct between them .",
    "this experiment can be used to test the pairing symmetry and recognize the different phases of @xmath38 which has two unitary and a nonunitary triplet pairing symmetry .",
