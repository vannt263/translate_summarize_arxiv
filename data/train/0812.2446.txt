    "we note that even though the _ size _ of the fragments ( controlled by @xmath67 ) changes substantially as @xmath17 varies from @xmath86 to @xmath128 , their shape is quite insensitive to relatively large changes in @xmath17 with concomitantly large changes in @xmath49 and @xmath78 . for the value of @xmath92 chosen in fig.[f : comparison ] , @xmath67 is only about 0.2 when @xmath129 , and yet the shape of the corresponding fragments only differ slightly from those obtained when @xmath130 and @xmath67 is close to 0.9 .",
