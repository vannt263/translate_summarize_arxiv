    "during core - he burning 3@xmath5 and @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reactions compete to determine the helium burning time scale , together with the convection mechanism , and the relative abundances of oxygen and carbon prior to core - c burning .",
    "w. a. fowler , a nobel laureate in physics in 1983 , definitely held a view that the abundance ratio of @xmath0c to @xmath2o and the solar neutrino problem are serious difficulties in the most basic concepts of nuclear astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "the work of many investigators has resulted in a knowledge of the predicted reaction rate of 3@xmath5 process within about 10%  @xcite accuracy at the usual helium - burning temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , the same of the @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction is much less well determined , and it is highly desirable to know this rate with comparable accuracy  @xcite to that of the 3@xmath5 process in order to provide adequate constraints on stellar evolution and the synthesis of elements , e.g. the yield of the neutrino - process isotopes @xmath6li , @xmath7b , @xmath8f , @xmath9la and @xmath10ta in core - collapse supernovae  @xcite , and the production of the important radioactive nuclei @xmath11al , @xmath12ti , and @xmath13fe  @xcite .",

    "this study presents a new r - matrix theory for the @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o s factor at helium burning temperature , and a number of applications to demonstrate the applicability and versatility of this theory .",
    "the final result of s(0.3 mev ) = 162.7 @xmath4 7.3 represents the most precise extrapolation of the @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o s factor at helium burning temperature based on a set of complementary data including all available information of @xmath2o system so far .",
    "this is to our knowledge the first published analysis meeting the precision requirements on @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o .",
    "the whole s factor from 0.3 mev to 10 mev provides astrophysical reaction rate of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o with a sound basis for researches of nucleosynthesis and evolution of stars .",

    "<S> determination of the accurate astrophysical s factor of @xmath0c(@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction has been regarded as a holy grail of nuclear astrophysics for decades . in current stellar models , </S>",
