    "an emission feature is rarely produced from such viewing , but it should be noted that it is under certain conditions for instance in the model presented by @xcite .",
    "a formalism for handling clumpy media was developed by @xcite ( hereafter n02 & n08a ) ; the formalism holds for volume filling factors as large as 10% .",
    "their models show that a clumpy torus will never produce a very deep absorption feature and that the feature displays a much richer behavior than in smooth density models ; in particular , type  1 viewing can produce an absorption feature in certain models and type  2 viewing can lead to an emission feature in others ( * ? ? ? * n08b henceforth ) .    while the @xcite data suggest the possibility of a 10emission feature in qso2 , the only unambiguous evidence for such a feature in a type  2 agn was presented recently for the seyfert galaxy ngc  2110 @xcite .",

    "the rest - frame spectrum is cut off around 12 , before the continuum longward of the feature could be established . ] here we present the first unambiguous case of an emission feature in a type  2 quasar , , and perform extensive fitting of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with clumpy torus models .",
    "the comparison of torus model predictions with observations is somewhat problematic because the overwhelming majority of these observations do not properly isolate the torus ir emission .",
    "starburst emission is a well known contaminant in many cases , and we selected  for modeling precisely for this reason as its spectrum seems free of starburst indicators .",
    "however , even ir from the immediate vicinity of the agn may not always originate exclusively from the torus .",
    "high - resolution observations of ngc1068 by @xcite and recently by @xcite demonstrate that the torus contributes less than 30% of the 10  flux collected with apertures @xmath3 in this object , with the bulk of this flux coming from dust in the ionization cones ( @xcite also found that at least 40% of the 12.4  flux in this source do not originate from the torus ) .",
    "the significance of ir emission from the narrow line region ( nlr ) was noted also by @xcite .",
    "however , because the dust in the ionization cones is optically thin , its ir emission is isotropic and does not generate differences between types 1 and 2 .",
    "observations show that such differences do exist . in particular , the @xcite compilation of _ spitzer _ ir observations shows a markedly different behavior for the 10feature between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "accepting the framework of the unification scheme , these differences can be attributed only to the torus contribution .",
    "thus it seems that , unfortunately , a general rule does not exist and the situation must be investigated case by case .",
    "our aim here is to examine whether the torus contribution alone can reproduce the observed sed of , yielding a range of possible parameter values that describe the dusty cloud distribution in this source (  [ sec : sil_emission_qso2 ] ) .",
    "we also investigate the cause for apparent shifts of the silicate feature peaks towards long wavelengths (  [ sec : peakshift ] ) .",
    "such shifts have been reported for sources that show the 10  feature in emission @xcite , and attributed to non - standard dust chemistry .",

    "the irs observations ( astronomical observation request 1406768 ) were taken on 2005 august 14 in staring mode using the short and long low resolution modules to obtain continuous coverage from 5.238  , and were passed through the s14.0 version of the ssc pipeline .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio varied through the spectrum , the deepest observations being targeted on the redshifted wavelengths of the strong spectral features expected to lie in the 715  range . in the short wavelength module , two 14s ramps were taken in second order , and a single 60s ramp in first order . in the long wavelength module , two 30s ramps were taken in both first and second order .",
    "the spectra from each module were optimally extracted using spice .",
    "the resulting spectra were trimmed , combined , and resampled in constant energy bins of @xmath5 , resulting in a spectrum ranging from 4.0  to 27.1  ( rest wavelength ) .",
    "uncertainty estimates from spice were propagated through the process in the usual manner . for the fitting we excluded a few data points at shorter and at longer wavelengths due to poor signal - to - noise ratio . additionally , we make use of two photometric data points from the infrared array camera ( irac ) component of the _ spitzer _ first look survey @xcite at rest wavelengths of 2.7  and 3.4  , both with very small intrinsic uncertainties , as they greatly help defining the shape of the sed in the regions of hot dust emission .",

    "while 28 models have @xmath79 , the other 10 fall in the = 1618 range , with a large gap between the two groups . because values of  larger than 10 are unlikely in general ( see  3.4 in ) , we exclude the ten models with @xmath80 from our sample .    as before ,",
    "only three parameters are well constrained .",
    "the radial cloud distribution is again well - constrained , but now it is flat with @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to a strongly constrained torus thickness @xmath82 , in sharp contrast with  where  is the least - well constrained parameter .",
    "all 28 models in the selected sample have the same value of , although this probably reflects our discrete sampling of parameter space ; there could be a small range around  = 20 , but 10 and 30 are clearly excluded .",

    "however , the average number of clouds along the line of sight to the agn ( see equation  [ eq : ni ] ) falls within the narrow range @xmath84 for all accepted models . to a certain degree",
    ", @xmath54 is a good proxy for the typical number of clouds along lines of sight that pass close to the dust sublimation radius , where the 10  emission is originating . in panel ( a1 ) of figure  [",
    "fig : f7 ] we show the number of clouds along all lines of sight through the best - fit torus model .",
    "panel ( a2 ) shows a one - dimensional cut through the image , providing the profile of the number of clouds per ray along the @xmath85-coordinate at @xmath86 . due to the axial symmetry of the torus , this profile is symmetric with respect to @xmath87 , irrespective of the viewing angle .",
    "the signature of the central cavity is clearly visible in this profile : the cloud column reaches a minimum of 2.4 at the center and stays close to this level for all @xmath88 .",
    "it reaches a maximum of @xmath89 clouds along rays roughly @xmath90 away from the agn .",
    "panel ( a3 ) shows the corresponding profile in the vertical direction at @xmath91 .",
    "the symmetry of this profile around @xmath86 again reflects the axial symmetry , which ensures equal path lengths through the torus above and below the central line of sight .",
    "while the number of clouds along two lines of sight displaced symmetrically from the center is equal , the illumination patterns of individual clouds as seen by the observer can differ for the two , depending on the position angle in the plane of the sky . in panel ( b1 )",

    "roughly 50% of the flux is detected within the inner @xmath93 radius , and 70% of that fraction comes from the image upper half .",

    "the shape of the vertical profile in ( b3 ) reveals the asymmetry between the emission in the upper and lower halves . despite equal cloud columns along viewing lines above and below the image center , the emission is not equal , owing to the strong anisotropy of single cloud emission .",
    "the 10  emission originates from hot , bright surfaces of clouds located on the torus far inner face .",
    "clouds in the torus near side , which show their dark , cooler faces , only absorb the 10  photons that were emitted on the torus far side .    most clumpy torus models do not produce the apparent shift in peak emission .",

    "in addition to the torus emission , the infrared radiation of many active galaxies contains a starburst contribution whose fractional strength varies from source to source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "removing the starburst component by subtracting a suitable template and leaving no pah residuals is thus an important preliminary step in the detailed sed analysis of many individual agn ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the analyses by @xcite and gallimore et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) of the same data set provide an even stronger evidence : the former ignores the potential starburst contribution while the latter includes a pah component , handled with the pahfit tool @xcite .",
    "in spite of this difference , the histograms in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : f8 ] are quite similar , showing comparable lower and slightly increased upper limits on  and an overall shape that is essentially the same .",
    "comparison of the histograms for type  1 sources in the panels of figure  [ fig : f8 ] shows that in moving from seyfert to quasar luminosities the 10  feature shifts to enhanced emission .",
    "this trend was noted earlier in @xcite ( @xcite ; see  6.4 ) , and the analysis here verifies this suggestion , giving it quantitative evidence .",
    "nenkova et  al.point out that the most likely explanation is that the number of clouds along radial rays is smaller in quasars than in seyferts .",
    "grouping together the qsos and seyfert  1s of the @xcite sample , the top panel of figure  [ fig : f9 ] shows the histograms and table  [ tab : s10 ] lists the statistical indicators of the distributions in type  1 and  2 sources .",
    "most sources exhibit rather small absolute values of .",
    "the histogram of type  1 sources is clearly shifted toward emission in comparison with type  2 .",
    "although the @xcite sources do not constitute a complete sample , the selection criteria were unrelated to the silicate feature .",
    "the derived histograms can thus be reasonably considered representative of the differences between types  1 and  2 .",
    "our clumpy torus models should produce similar histograms if they bear a resemblance to the ir emission from agn .",
    "such a comparison presents two fundamental difficulties .",
    "first , the assignment of a given clumpy model to type  1 or  2 is not deterministic  only a probability can be assigned .",
    "we handle this problem by dividing the models according to the probability  for an unobscured view of the agn .",
    "the collection of models with @xmath105 can be expected to resemble the behavior of the type  1 population , those with type  2 .",
    "the second problem is that the actual distribution of parameter values is unknown .",
    "since we do not have any handle on these distributions , we decided to test the adequacy of histograms produced by a uniform sampling of the model parameters within the bounds deduced in : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "since  was sampled here more thoroughly than in , we use the full range listed in table  [ tab : clumpyparams ] .",
    "the parameters were sampled in steps of 0.5 , 1 , 10 , 5 , 10 , 10 for , , , , , i , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : f9 ] shows the histograms of  for all database models selected by these criteria .",
    "these distributions resemble those of the observational sample , as is also evident from their statistical properties listed in table  [ tab : s10 ] .",
    "the @xmath111 and @xmath112 ranges of given in the table contain sources and models within 1 and 2 standard deviations @xmath113 from the mean of each of the two distributions .",
    "leading to exclusion of only few sources and models at the very ends of the distributions , this additional selection has the effect of a much more meaningful agreement of the two distribution widths , not spoiled by rare outliers . at the @xmath114 level ,",
    "rejected sources are just 3 type  1 and 2 seyfert  2s , and among the sample of models only 4% of those with and 6% with are excluded due to this criterion .",
    "although the choice of uniform sampling of the model database is arbitrary , it produces reasonable results .",
    "the reason is that , as noted already in and , clumpy models never produce very deep absorption features , in agreement with observations .",
    "this limited range is reflected in the histograms for any reasonable criteria used for model selection from the database .",

    "has already been shown to be a signature of clumpy dust distributions @xcite .",
    "here we go a step further and produce the histogram of 10  feature strength for a large sample of agn  models .",
    "the result is in good qualitative agreement with the sample observed by @xcite . in particular , the median values of both type  1 and type  2 observed distributions and their widths are well reproduced by the model database .",

    "close to 1,700 models with very different parameters deviate by no more than 10% from the best - fit model . and while the much higher quality of data in  greatly reduces the number of acceptable models , there are still 28 different ones that are practically indistinguishable in the quality of their fits . in the face of this degeneracy , we have developed a statistical approach to assess the meaningfulness of the various torus parameters derived from the fits .",
    "we find that some parameters are well constrained in each case , while others are not . in both sources the power law of the radial distribution ( ) and the optical depth of a single cloud ( ) are well constrained , while the torus viewing angle ( i ) and its angular thickness ( ) are not . both the cloud number ( ) and radial thickness ( ) are well constrained in only one of the sources , a different one in each case .",
    "@xcite have recently developed a different , novel approach to tackle the degeneracy problem .",
    "they interpolate the  seds by means of an artificial neural network function , allowing them to study the parameter distributions as if they were continuous , and employ bayesian inference to determine the most likely set of parameters . applying this method to a selection of sources , @xcite",
    "find that the principal ability to constrain different  parameters strongly depends on the individual source .",
    "we have already begun an extensive comparison of the two approaches and will report our findings elsewhere .",
    "although the sed alone is generally insufficient for determining all the torus parameters with certainty , the success in resolving outstanding puzzling behavior of the 10  feature in agn is encouraging and enhances confidence in the clumpy torus paradigm .",
