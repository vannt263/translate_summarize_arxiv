    "besides the relation between @xmath71k and @xmath72k @xcite and the @xmath1-dependent couplings @xcite there is the observation that the zero - point motion of lattice exceeds the static distortions considerably @xcite . in particular in the i phase",
    ", this zero - point motion has an important effect on the alternating local magnetisation @xcite . on the basis of results as in fig .",

    "theory and experiment can be reconciled if the zero - point motion of the `` phonons '' of the soliton lattice , the so - called phasons , are taken into account .",
    "this motion leads to a reduction of the alternating component @xcite which can be mimicked by an average of the magnetisation of adjacent sites @xcite .",
    "the phasons are connected to the spontaneous breaking of the quasi - continuous symmetry of translating the modulations along the chains .",
    "such translations require that the distortions are also dynamic .",

    "this was expected since the fluctuations are maximum in the center of the soliton ( see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "most interesting is the fact that the distortion is smoothened more than the alternating magnetisation . from the fits",

    "clearly , all widths are enhanced .",
    "the additional coupling strongly favours the alternating magnetisation close to the center of the soliton .",
    "thus the 2d coupling induces an increase of this region thereby enlarging the soliton @xcite .",
    "so the agreement with experiment will be improved by taking the 2d character of the magnetic couplings into account .",
    "yet further questions still remain as the ratio between distortive and magnetic soliton width is decreased on increasing @xmath100 in contrast to experiment .",
    "in this work we contrasted the adiabatic approach to spin - peierls transitions with the antiadiabatic approach .",
    "if the latter is complemented by a chain - mean - field treatment both approaches yield very similar equations .",

    "<S> since the atomic displacements are small we assume that they influence the magnetic exchange in linear order @xmath10 unfortunately , this hamiltonian is too complicated . </S>",
    "<S> so one argues that the 1d magnetic subsystem strongly favours a distortion at wave vector @xmath11 which is underlined by the dimerisation below the transition temperature @xmath12 and by the diverging dimer - dimer correlation at @xmath11 for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> hence those phonons matter most which are in the vicinity of the actual lattice distortion at @xmath14 for @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon propagators are renormalised in rpa by the magnetic response in the dimer - dimer channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is signalled by the vanishing of the renormalised phonon frequency , the so - called phonon softening . </S>",
    "<S> this description applies if the phonons are the _ slow _ degrees of freedom @xcite which are renormalised by the _ fast _ magnetic degrees of freedom . </S>",

    "<S> hence the phonon can not become soft if @xmath29 holds . </S>",
    "<S> this view , suggested in particular for the spin - peierls substance cugeo@xmath0 @xcite , is corroborated by field theoretic results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second route consists in the antiadiabatic approach which considers the spin system as _ slow _ and the phononic system as _ </S>",

    "<S> couplings dependent on @xmath1 arise in the next - leading order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition into the ordered phase does not occur due to the softening of a phonon but due to the tendency of the effective spin model towards dimerisation . </S>",
    "<S> considering a _ single _ chain phonon - induced frustration above its critical value @xmath31 @xcite drives the dimerisation @xcite . </S>",
