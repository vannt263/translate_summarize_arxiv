    "since the groundbreaking work of donaldson it is known that every symplectic @xmath0-manifold admits a symplectic lefschetz pencil @xcite , and conversely , every lefschetz fibration with non - empty critical locus admits a symplectic structure @xcite . on the other hand , lefschetz",
    "pencils / fibrations are determined by their monodromy factorizations , which are prescribed by products of positive dehn twists isotopic to identity / boundary multitwist on the fiber @xcite .",
    "these results yield a combinatorial description of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds in terms of ordered tuples of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on an orientable surface . here",
    "we will extend this fundamental approach , by introducing and studying positive factorizations in a _ framed mapping class group _",
    ", so as to describe symplectic @xmath0-manifolds together with various important symplectic surfaces in them in terms of ordered simple closed curves and arcs between marked points on an orientable surface .",
    "let @xmath2 be a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold equipped with a lefschetz fibration @xmath3 .",
    "we call an embedded , possibly disconnected surface @xmath4 in @xmath2 a _ multisection _ or _ @xmath5-section _",
    "if @xmath6 is an @xmath5-fold branched cover with only simple branched points .",
    "we assume that both lefschetz critical points and branched points conform to local complex models , that is , we work with _ positive _ lefschetz fibrations and _ positive _ branched points . precise definitions and the basic background material are given in section  [ preliminaries ] below .",
    "the first main result of our article is the description of multisections and their ambient topology via positive factorizations in framed mapping class groups , given in detail in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "the framings amount to working with a new mapping class group of a compact oriented surface with marked boundary circles ( one marked point on each boundary component ) , which consists of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving self - diffeomorphisms that are allowed to swap boundary components while matching the marked points .",
    "this group is naturally isomorphic to the mapping class group of a _ closed _ surface with attached vectors at a finite _ set _ of marked points , so as to frame a tubular neighborhood of the multisection @xmath4 ( where the end points of these vectors , and equivalently the marked points on the boundaries trace a push - off of @xmath4 ) . in section  [ mcg ] ,",
    "leading to the proof of this theorem , we introduce the notion of positivity for monodromy factorizations in this more general setting .",
    "as we will show , from these positive factorizations , for each multisection @xmath4 , one can easily read off the degree ( i.e. the number of times @xmath4 intersects the fibers ) , topology ( number of components and genera of each component of @xmath4 ) and the self - intersection numbers of the components of @xmath4 . here is our main theorem of section  [ mcg ] , stated for a connected @xmath4 for simplicity while the reader might want to turn to that section for the description of various mapping classes appearing in the below factorizations :    [ firstquote ] a genus-@xmath7 lefschetz fibration @xmath8 with a self - intersection @xmath9 connected @xmath5-section @xmath10 with @xmath11 branched points away from @xmath12 , and @xmath13 branched points at lefschetz singularities corresponding to vanishing cycles @xmath14 , among @xmath15 yields to a lift of the monodromy factorization @xmath16 in @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a subset of @xmath19 which covers all the elements of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a lift of half twist as described in figure  [ lift_monodromy1 ] , and @xmath22 is a lift of the dehn twist @xmath23 as described in figure  [ lift_monodromy2 ] , such that all @xmath24 are hit by the collection of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath27 is a simple closed curve in @xmath28 which is isotopic to @xmath29 via the inclusion @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a set of simple closed curves parallel to @xmath19 , where @xmath32 conversely , from any such relation in @xmath17 , subject to the conditions listed above , one can construct a genus-@xmath7 lefschetz fibration @xmath8 with a connected @xmath5-section @xmath4 of genus @xmath33 and self - intersection @xmath9 as above , whose monodromy factorization is given by the image of the factorization on the left hand side under the homomorphism forgetting @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , up to an extended set of hurwitz moves , there exists a one - to - one correspondence between lefschetz fibrations with multisections and positive factorizations in the above framed mapping class group.@xcite    as observed by donaldson and smith @xcite , any , possibly disconnected symplectic surface @xmath4 in @xmath34 can be indeed realized as a multisection of a high enough degree lefschetz pencil on @xmath2 , which does not go through any lefschetz critical points .",
    "our theorem therefore extends the combinatorial interpretation of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold , which couples the results of donaldson and gompf with the earlier works of kas and matsumoto , to that of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold and disjoint symplectic surfaces in it in terms of ordered tuples of interior curves @xmath35 and arcs @xmath36 with end points on marked points @xmath37 on distinct boundary components of @xmath28 ( corresponding to the factors @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown by loi and piergallini @xcite that any compact stein surface @xmath40 can be obtained as a covering of the unit @xmath0-ball @xmath41 branched along a _ braided surface _",
    "@xmath4 , such that the composition @xmath42 is an allowable lefschetz fibration , along with the obvious converse result . in this case",
    ", we obtain a similar combinatorial description of a stein surface @xmath40 together with the branched locus @xmath4 in terms of _ pairs _ of arcs @xmath43 , each with end points on the marked points on the same pair of distinct boundary components of @xmath28 ( corresponding to the factors @xmath22 ) .",
    "although we note that the latter can be always perturbed ( remark  [ rem_perturbation ] ) to a factorization which only consists of factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we present our results in this full generality so as to not only mark the case of compact stein surfaces , but also because we often find it useful to first produce factorizations containing multisections going through lefschetz critical points .",
    "we should make two remarks here .",
    "first , although the framed mapping class group @xmath17 has a large set of generators , which for instance involve boundary pushing maps ( lifts of point pushing maps ) , what we have manifested in theorem  [ firstquote ] is that for the geometric situations discussed above , it suffices to work with boundary twists and usual dehn twists .",
    "secondly , our framed mapping class group is larger than the mapping class group of a surface with boundary which consists of isotopy classes of self - diffeomorphisms that fix _ each boundary component _ , the latter being the natural mapping class group to work with when dealing with _",
    "@xmath5 disjoint sections_. the distinction between these two groups is analogous to that of the framed surface braid group versus the framed pure surface braid group , which have appeared in two recent works that are worth mentioning here : bellingeri and gervais studied the exact sequences relating these braid groups @xcite , whereas massuyeau , oancea and salamon used the same groups to describe the monodromy action of the fundamental group on the first homology of the fiber in terms of the picard - lefschetz intersection data associated to vanishing cycles of a given lefschetz fibration @xcite .",
    "combining the seminal work of taubes @xcite and donaldson @xcite , and following the ideas of donaldson and smith @xcite mentioned above , a blow - up of any given symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 with @xmath44 admits a lefschetz fibration with respect to which all seiberg - witten basic classes are multisections ( called _ standard surfaces _ in @xcite ) , as discussed in the appendix  [ sw ] . translating this to positive mapping class group factorizations as we prescribed in section  [ mcg ] ,",
    "we conclude that symplectic @xmath0-manifolds and their seiberg - witten basic classes can be _ a priori _ represented combinatorially in terms of our positive factorizations .",
    "section  [ genus3counter ] contains many examples of kodaira dimension zero symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , where all the seiberg - witten basic classes are represented by a collection of @xmath45-multisections ( as dictated by the blow - up formula for seiberg - witten invariants ) of the constructed lefschetz fibrations on them . in the appendix  [ knotsurgery ] , we present kodaira dimension @xmath46 examples ; namely , we carry out a sample calculation of monodromy factorizations of lefschetz fibrations on the knot surgered elliptic surfaces which capture all their seiberg - witten basic classes .",
    "the remaining sections  @xmath0@xmath47 of the article gather a variety of applications , relying on the constructive converse direction of our main theorem .",
    "each section focuses on a different problem related to the topology of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds and lefschetz fibrations on them , yet what is in common for all is the essential use of our mapping class group techniques involving multisections .",
    "the novelty of ideas and techniques employed in our constructions of examples in section  @xmath48@xmath47 can easily be seen to amount to _ recipes _ one can employ with the right set of of lefschetz fibrations and multisections in hand , where we will be focusing on producing the _ smallest _ genus examples of each kind , which are the hardest to obtain in our experience .",
    "in section  [ scy ] we provide an alternate approach to the _ smooth _ classification of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds of kodaira dimension zero , i.e. ( blow - ups ) of symplectic calabi - yau @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the only known examples of kodaira dimension zero symplectic @xmath0-manifolds are torus bundles over tori , the @xmath1 and the enriques surfaces , which , up to diffeomorphisms , conjecturally exhaust all the possibilities . using our work from section  [ mcg ] and the following theorem we prove in section  [ scy ] ( theorem  [ scylf ] )",
    ", we translate the problem to a combinatorial one ( theorem  [ scylf ] , corollary  [ scycor ] and question  [ scyconjecture ] ) :    let @xmath8 be a genus-@xmath7 lefschetz fibration with @xmath49 , and @xmath2 be neither rational nor ruled",
    ". then , there exists a symplectic form @xmath50 on @xmath2 compatible with @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is a ( blow - up of ) a symplectic calabi - yau @xmath0-manifold , if and only if there is a disjoint collection of @xmath45-spheres that are @xmath53-sections of @xmath8 such that @xmath54 .    motivated by this",
    ", we introduce new techniques based on certain symmetries , to lift better understood relations from genus @xmath55 and @xmath46 surfaces to higher genus surfaces under involutions , so as to construct explicit monodromy factorizations of lefschetz pencils on symplectic calabi - yau @xmath1 and enriques surfaces , i.e. minimal symplectic @xmath0-manifolds of kodaira dimension zero , homeomorphic to @xmath1 and enriques surfaces , respectively ; see propositions  [ lem_signature_genus3lf ] and  [ lem_pi1_genus2lf ] .",
    "in section  [ stipsicz ] we turn to an interesting conjecture of stipsicz on fiber sum indecomposable lefschetz fibrations , which can be regarded as prime building blocks of any lefschetz fibration via the fiber sum operation . in @xcite , having proved the converse statement , stipsicz conjectured that any fiber sum indecomposable lefschetz fibration admits a @xmath45-sphere section , an affirmative answer to which would allow one to think of any lefschetz fibration to be obtained from lefschetz pencils through blow - ups and fiber sums .",
    "curiously , up to date , there was only one known counter - example to this conjecture , which was a genus-@xmath56 lefschetz fibration constructed by auroux , as observed by sato in @xcite . in lemma  [ lem_lantern_relation ] , we introduce a generalization of the lantern relation involving multisections , which allows us to braid exceptional sections into exceptional multisections of a new lefschetz fibration obtained by a rational blow - down of the underlying symplectic @xmath0-manifold .",
    "relying on this key lemma , and our special monodromy factorizations of symplectic calabi - yau lefschetz fibrations obtained in section  [ scy ] , where one can keep track of _ all _ exceptional classes and sections , we prove that the above counter - example is not a mere exception ( theorems  [ thm_example_genus3 ] and [ thm_example_genus2 ] ) :    there are several genus @xmath57 and genus @xmath56 fiber sum indecomposable lefschetz fibrations on blow - ups of symplectic calabi - yau @xmath0-manifolds , which do not admit any @xmath45 sphere sections .    section  [ nonisomorphic ] deals with the _ diversity _ of lefschetz pencils / fibrations on a symplectic @xmath0-manifold .",
    "namely , we prove that blow - ups of symplectic calabi - yau @xmath1 surfaces can be supported by non - isomorphic lefschetz pencils of the same genera and same number of base points , which have ambiently homeomorphic fibers .",
    "park and yun used monodromy groups to construct pairs of non - isomorphic lefschetz fibrations on knot surgered elliptic surfaces , which are kodaira dimension @xmath46 symplectic @xmath0-manifolds @xcite , and more recently , the first author proved that blow - ups of any symplectic @xmath0-manifold which is not rational or ruled carry arbitrarily large number of non - isomorphic lefschetz fibrations @xcite . here",
    "we show that for a certain configuration of lefschetz vanishing cycles and @xmath45-sphere sections , one can perform a pair of monodromy substitutions which amount to rational - blowdowns that `` mirror '' each other s topological effect .",
    "these result in lefschetz fibrations on the _ same _ symplectic @xmath0-manifold with ambiently homeomorphic fibers . building on our examples of monodromy factorizations tailored specifically to contain such configurations",
    ", we then obtain the following on symplectic @xmath0-manifolds of kodaira dimension @xmath55 ( theorem  [ nonisomlfs ] ) :    there are pairs of genus-@xmath7 relatively minimal non - isomorphic lefschetz pencils @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath7 can be taken as small as @xmath57 , or arbitrarily large .    in section",
    "[ exotic ] we investigate a natural question : does the _ topology _ of a lefschetz pencil ( fiber genus , number of separating / non - separating vanishing cycles and base points ) uniquely determine the diffeomorphism type of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold within its homeomorphism class ? here we answer this question in the negative by constructing the first examples of pairwise homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , supported by lefschetz pencils with the same topology . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only previously known examples of this type were the lefschetz _ fibrations _ of fintushel and stern on knot surgered elliptic surfaces all of kodaira dimension @xmath46 , again .",
    "here we construct the first examples of such pencils ( theorem  [ exoticlp ] ) :    there are genus-@xmath57 exotic lefschetz pencils @xmath60 , @xmath61 , with symplectic kodaira dimension",
    "@xmath62 , where @xmath63 are homeomorphic to @xmath64",
    ". moreover , there are similar examples with arbitrarily high genus and the same topology for the singular fibers on higher blow - ups of homotopy @xmath1s .",
    "lastly , in the same section , we also show that a careful application of the same circle of ideas provide a new way of constructing exotic embeddings of surfaces in @xmath0-manifolds , i.e. @xmath65 in @xmath2 , @xmath59 , such that there are ambient homeomorphisms taking one to the other , but there exist no such ambient diffeomorphisms ( theorem  [ exoticknotting ] ) :    there are exotic embeddings of genus-@xmath57 surfaces @xmath65 in a blow - up of a symplectic calabi - yau @xmath1 surface such that @xmath65 is symplectic with respect to deformation equivalent symplectic forms @xmath66 on @xmath2 , for @xmath59 .",
    "we will finish with noting a further motivation for our study of multisections .",
    "the rather explicit description of a @xmath0-manifold obtained via monodromy of a lefschetz fibration on it very often allows one to detect various configurations of symplectic surfaces in it ; disjoint copies of fibers and sections , as well as matching pairs of lefschetz vanishing cycles are a few examples of this sort . coupled with the non - triviality of seiberg - witten invariants on symplectic @xmath0-manifolds ,",
    "this has been the most essential source of producing new symplectic and smooth @xmath0-manifolds in the past few decades .",
    "( see for instance @xcite for an excellent survey of such construction methods . )",
    "a close look at these constructions shows that sections and multisections of such lefschetz fibrations feature a key role .",
    "we therefore expect that the monodromy factorizations , which involve multisections to produce interesting configurations of surfaces ( such as the ones we used in our rational - blowdowns in sections  [ nonisomorphic ] and [ exotic ] ) , will be useful for building new symplectic and exotic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we plan to investigate this direction in future work .",
    "in this article , we assume that all manifolds are compact , connected , smooth and oriented , and all the maps between them are smooth .      let @xmath2 and @xmath67 be compact manifolds ( possibly with boundary ) of dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "@xmath74 ) compatible with the orientation of @xmath2 ( resp . of @xmath67 ) so that : @xmath75 we furthermore assume that for each point @xmath76 , the _ singular fiber _",
    "@xmath77 contains exactly one critical point @xmath78 of @xmath51 .",

    "_ irreducible _ ) if @xmath26 is separating ( resp .",
    "nonseparating ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath26 is null - homotopic in @xmath80 , it gives rise to a @xmath45-sphere contained in the singular fiber , which can be blow - down preserving the rest of the fibration .",
    "we will always work with _ relatively minimal _ lefschetz fibrations , which do not contain any @xmath45-spheres in the fibers .",
    "given any fibration with only lefschetz critical points , after a small perturbation one can always guarantee that there is at most one critical point on each fiber , as we built into our definition above .",
    "it shall be clear that @xmath51 restricts to a genus-@xmath7 surface bundle over @xmath81 .",
    "lastly , an _ achiral lefschetz fibration _ is defined in the same way as above except that the local coordinate @xmath82 is allowed to be incompatible with the orientation of @xmath2 .",

    "blowing - up all the points in @xmath85 , one obtains an honest lefschetz fibration @xmath88 with @xmath89 distinct @xmath45-sphere sections @xmath90 , namely the exceptional spheres of the respective blow - ups .",

    "clearly a @xmath46-section is an honest section of a lefschetz fibration .",

    "standard surface_. as it will become clear later , allowing our multisections to be branched at lefschetz critical points as well (",
    "although subject to the local model given above ) , we will have a more flexible setting which makes is possible to deal with larger families of examples of lefschetz fibrations with multisections of geometric significance .",
    "lastly , as in the case of achiral lefschetz fibrations , one can possibly work more generally with non necessarily positive multisections by allowing the local models to be incompatible with the orientations .",

    "a _ monodromy substitution _ is the trading of a subword in a given monodromy factorization by positive dehn twists with another subword of the same type .",
    "we will employ this operation more generally to monodromy factorizations capturing multisections as well , i.e. not only positive dehn twists but also positive arc twists for multisections will be allowed in the subwords . as shown by endo and gurtas , a particular substitution in a monodromy factorization of a lefschetz fibration which trades @xmath0 dehn twists with @xmath57 dehn twists by the lantern relation on a @xmath56-sphere with @xmath0 holes corresponds to produce a new lefschetz fibration corresponds to the simplest possible rational blow - down operation for the underlying @xmath0-manifolds : blowing - down a @xmath207 configuration which is a @xmath700-sphere formed by the @xmath0 vanishing cycles on the fiber .",

    "applying further simultaneous doublings to any one of the exotic lefschetz pencils @xmath60 we produced above give us exotic pairs of pencils of arbitrarily high genera .",

    "we call two surfaces @xmath834 , @xmath59 , _ exotically embedded _ in @xmath2 if there exists an ambient homeomorphism of @xmath2 taking @xmath835 to @xmath836 but there exists no such diffeomorphism .",
    "such symplectic surfaces are harder to produce : for instance , the work of siebert and tian shows that up to isotopy there is a unique symplectic surface in the homology class of an algebraic curve of degree @xmath837 in @xmath704 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , finashin @xcite , and h .- j.kim @xcite ( also see @xcite ) constructed knotted surfaces in @xmath704 that are not isotopic to algebraic curves , which can be seen to be not symplectic .",
    "the latter rely on a construction method of fintushel and stern @xcite , called ( twisted ) rim - surgery , and up to date this has been the only way of producing exotic embeddings of surfaces  and curiously , only producing symplectic tori when asked to lie in the same homology class .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a new way of constructing exotically embedded orientable surfaces :    [ exoticknotting ] there is a pair of genus-@xmath57 surfaces @xmath65 exotically embedded in a blow - up of a symplectic calabi - yau @xmath1 surface such that @xmath65 is symplectic with respect to deformation equivalent symplectic forms @xmath66 on @xmath2 , for @xmath59 .    in section  [ genus3counter ]",
    ", we constructed a lefschetz fibration @xmath713 by a braiding lantern substitution at part ( a ) of .",
    "we can now apply another braiding lantern substitution at part ( c ) , which yields to the genus-@xmath57 lefschetz fibration @xmath720 with two @xmath45-sphere bi - sections @xmath697 and @xmath721 we obtained earlier , or at part ( b ) , which yields to a new genus-@xmath57 lefschetz fibration @xmath838 with @xmath45-sphere @xmath57-section @xmath728 and a @xmath45-section @xmath717 .    since @xmath724 and @xmath839 are obtained from @xmath768 by rational blowdowns along @xmath700-spheres @xmath754 and @xmath755 ( prescribed by the lantern curves in parts ( c ) and ( b ) ) both intersecting the exceptional sphere @xmath716 at one point , they are diffeomorphic by proposition  [ gompflemma ] .",
    "let @xmath840 be regular fibers of @xmath841 and @xmath842 , respectively .",
    "there exists a pairwise homeomorphism between @xmath843 and @xmath844 : to see this , we first observe that the vanishing cycles in the complement of @xmath845 , and respectively of @xmath846 , allows us to easily compute @xmath847 .",
    "so both homology classes @xmath848 $ ] are indivisible .",
    "moreover , @xmath849 but @xmath850 , whereas for @xmath836 , @xmath842 has a reducible fiber component @xmath851 , so @xmath852 but @xmath853 .",
    "so both @xmath848 $ ] are not characteristic . since @xmath854 and @xmath855 for @xmath856 , by wall s theorem on automorphisms of the intersection form and freedman s topological h - cobordism theorem ( see for example @xcite p.152 - 153 ) , we get a homeomorphism between @xmath724 and @xmath839 matching the homology classes of @xmath835 and @xmath836 .",
    "finally , viewing the two surfaces in the same manifold under this homeomorphism , we can invoke @xcite to find a topological isotopy between them , which yields the desired homeomorphism between the pairs @xmath843 and @xmath844 .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath857 are symplectic calabi - yaus , and thus not rational or ruled , by li s work in @xcite , any diffeomorphism between them maps exceptional classes to exceptional classes in the same homology classes .",
    "however , in @xmath724 the two exceptional classes @xmath858 intersect @xmath835 both twice , whereas in @xmath839 we have two exceptional classes @xmath859 intersecting @xmath836 thrice and once . hence , there is no pairwise diffeomorphism between @xmath843 and @xmath844 .",
    "now if we let @xmath860 and identify @xmath835 with its image under the diffeomorphism between @xmath724 and @xmath839 , we conclude that @xmath840 is a pair of exotically embedded surfaces in @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , to prove our additional claim on the existence of deformation equivalent symplectic forms @xmath66 on @xmath2 with respect to which @xmath65 are symplectic , we first perturb the lefschetz fibration @xmath861 so that each quadruple of vanishing cycles appearing in part ( c ) and ( b ) of the monodromy factorization lie on the same singular fiber , forming a reducible @xmath700-sphere fiber component @xmath753 .",
    "we can then equip @xmath713 with a compatible symplectic form with respect to which both @xmath753s and the section @xmath716 are symplectic .",
    "now , by the work of mcduff and symington , who showed that gompf s diffeomorphism we employed here can be interpreted as a symplectic @xmath0-sum operation , the symplectic @xmath0-manifolds we produce by rational blowdowns of @xmath753 are symplectic deformation equivalent @xcite , with @xmath65 symplectic surfaces in them . we thus obtain the desired symplectic forms on @xmath2 by pulling - back the latter form on @xmath724 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a symplectic @xmath0-manifold with @xmath44 .",
    "we further assume that it has an integral symplectic form @xmath50 , which can always be achieved by replacing a given form with a multiple of a rational symplectic form approximating it . by taubes , for a generic almost complex structure @xmath441 on @xmath34 , any seiberg - witten basic class @xmath862 can be represented by a sum of @xmath441-holomorphic curves @xmath863 in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , each component of the representative of @xmath864 $ ] is an embedded smooth curve unless it is a torus of self - intersection zero ( in which case the image of the curve is still smoothly embedded , but the parametrization is a multiple cover ) or a sphere of negative self - intersection . since @xmath441 is @xmath50 tamed , each @xmath863 is a symplectic surface in @xmath34 .",
    "since the number of basic classes of a @xmath0-manifold is finite , so is the collection of the symplectic surfaces @xmath863 , sums of which represent the basic classes in @xmath34 . as noted by donaldson and smith (",
    "* proposition 2.9 ) replacing @xmath50 with a sufficiently high multiple @xmath865 , we can then assume that there exists a symplectic lefschetz pencil on @xmath2 for which all @xmath863 are multisections ( `` standard surfaces '' in the language of @xcite ) . by the blow - up formula for seiberg - witten classes ,",
    "we conclude that after passing to a blow - up of @xmath2 we get a symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath866 where all basic classes are represented by a collection of symplectic surfaces @xmath863 and the exceptional spheres @xmath867 .",
    "hence , each seiberg - witten basic class of @xmath807 is represented by a multisection ( possibly with several components ) .    to sum up , combining the works of taubes and donaldson , after passing to a blow - up @xmath807",
    ", one can represent all seiberg - witten classes of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 as multisections with respect to a lefschetz fibration .",
    "we shall note that this is merely an existence result , as the construction of such a lefschetz fibration is not explicit .",
    "we will now present explicit monodromy factorizations in the framed mapping class group capturing all basic classes of knot surgered elliptic surfaces as multisections of certain lefschetz fibrations on them .",
