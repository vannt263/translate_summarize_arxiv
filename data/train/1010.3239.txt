    "riemann zeta function @xmath16 ( where the product is taken over the set @xmath0 of all primes ) converges for @xmath17 .",
    "it has a analytic continuation to the complex plane with a simple pole at @xmath18 .",
    "the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) states that non - real zeros all lie on the critical line @xmath19 .",
    "rh has equivalent formulations , many of them having to do with the distribution of prime numbers @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be the divisor function .",
    "there exists a remarkable parallel between the error term @xmath21 in the summatory function of @xmath20 ( dirichlet s divisor problem ) and the corresponding mean - square estimates @xmath22 of @xmath23 on the critical line , see @xcite for a review",
    ". this may explain ramanujan s interest for highly composite numbers @xcite .",
    "a highly composite number is a positive integer @xmath10 such that for any integer @xmath12 , @xmath24 , i.e. it has more divisors than any positive integer smaller than itself .",
    "this landmark work eventually led to robin s formulation of rh in terms of the sum of divisor function @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath26 the numbers that do not satisfy ( [ robin ] ) are in the set @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "if rh is false , the smallest value of @xmath29 that violates the inequality should be a superabundant number @xcite , i.e. a positive number @xmath10 satisfying @xmath30 no counterexample has been found so far .    in the present paper ,",
    "robin s criterion is refined by replacing the sum of divisor function by the dedekind psi function @xmath31 .",
    "should not be confused with the second chebyshev function @xmath32 since @xmath33 , with equality when @xmath10 is free of square , we establish the refined criterion @xmath34 the numbers that do not satisfy ( [ dedekind ] ) are in the set @xmath35 .    a number that would possibly violate ( [ dedekind ] ) should satisfy @xmath36 and be a primorial number @xmath37 ( the product of the first @xmath10 primes ) or one its multiples smaller than @xmath14 ( sloane sequence @xmath15 ) .",
    "according to a mertens theorem @xcite , one has @xmath38 and we show that none of the numbers larger than @xmath39 in the sequence @xmath15 can violate ( [ dedekind ] ) . as a result , rh may only be true .    in the next section ,",
    "we provide the proof of ( [ dedekind ] ) and compare it with the robin s criterion ( [ robin ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the structure of numbers satisfying ( [ newsuperab ] ) and justify why they fail to provide counterexamples to rh .    originally , dedekind introduced @xmath5 as the index of the congruence subgroup @xmath40 in the modular group ( see @xcite , p. 79 ) . in our recent work ,",
    "the dedekind psi function plays a role for understanding the commutation relations of quantum observables within the discrete heisenberg / pauli group @xcite .",
    "in particular , it counts the cardinality of the projective line @xmath41 of the lattice @xmath42 .",
    "the relevance of the dedekind psi function @xmath5 in the context of rh is novel .",
    "for other works aiming at a refinement of robin s inequality , we mention @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us compute the sequence @xmath43 of all positive numbers satisfying ( [ newsuperab ] ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath45 , which are the first terms of sloane sequence @xmath15 , consisting of the primorials @xmath13 and their multiples up to the next primorial @xmath14 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that about half of the numbers in @xmath46 are not superabundant ( compare to sloane sequence @xmath47 ) .",
    "based on calculations performed on the numbers in the finite sequence @xmath46 , we are led to three properties that the infinite sequence @xmath15 should satisfy    * proposition 1 * : for any @xmath48 such that @xmath49 one has @xmath50 .    _",
    "proof _ : one may use @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 to simplify the proof .    when @xmath53 is prime , one observes that @xmath54 for some @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding dedekind psi function is evaluated as    @xmath56    then , with @xmath57 one concludes that @xmath58    when @xmath53 is not prime , a similar calculation is performed by decomposing @xmath53 into a product of primes and by using the multiplicative property of @xmath5 .",
    "* proposition 2 * : given @xmath59 , for any @xmath60 such that @xmath61 one has @xmath62 .",
    "_ proof _ : this proposition is proved by using inequality ( [ newsuperab ] ) at @xmath63    @xmath64}{(l+1)n_n}~\\mbox{for}~\\mbox{any}~ m<(l+1)n_n\\ ] ]    and the relation @xmath65=(l+1)\\psi(n_n)$ ] . as a result    @xmath66    * proposition 3 * : there exist _ infinitely many _",
    "prime numbers @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .    _",
    "remarks on the proposition 3 : _ based on experimental evidence in table 1 , one would expect that @xmath69 and that the proposition 3 is false .",
    "similarly , one would expect that @xmath70 for any @xmath10 .",
    "for instance it is known @xcite that    @xmath71    .an excerpt of values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 versus the number of primes in the primorial @xmath13 . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    according to the calculations illustated in the table ii and the bound established in ( [ lbound ] ) , there are no exceptions to the refined robin s criterion . since robin s criterion has been shown to be equivalent to rh hypothesis , rh may only be true .",
    "the author thanks p. sol for pointing out his paper @xcite , following the presentation of @xcite at qupa meeting in paris on 09/23/2010 . he acknowledges j.  l. nicolas for helping him to establish the proposition 3 .",
