    "determining the symmetry of the order - parameter ( op ) in high temperature superconductors ( hts ) has been the subject of both experimental and theoretical studies . in the case of ybacuo",
    "it was found that the op is dominated by d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "one of the important experimental results in support of this was the zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) measured in tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "dagan et al.@xcite have shown , experimentally , that in over - doped , ( 110 ) oriented , ybco samples a spontaneous splitting of the zbcp occurs at low temperatures .",
    "they have related this splitting to the appearance of a sub - dominant imaginary op ( siop ) , with a maximum value of around 25% of the d - wave amplitude .",
    "sharoni et al.@xcite using stm junctions have found a similar behavior in ycabacuo , ( 110 ) oriented , over - doped samples .",
    "both results were obtained in n / i / s contacts .",
    "tanuma et al.@xcite have shown that in the case of a ( 110 ) surface of a @xmath4 superconductor ( sc ) in contact with a normal metal , the amplitude of the d - wave op is reduced in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "this reduction allows for the appearance of a siop of either _ _ id__@xmath5 or _ _ is__@xmath6 symmetry .",
    "they have further shown that the larger is the reduction in the @xmath4 amplitude the larger is the siop amplitude .",
    "y. ohashi@xcite have predicted a proximity effect , where a small , s - wave symmetry op , is induced in a normal metal by a sc with a @xmath4 symmetry op .",
    "this effect appears in the case of a normal metal and a ( 100 ) surface of a @xmath4 sc and is enhanced in high transmission contacts .",
    "the appearance of the induced s - wave op in the normal metal causes a reduction of the d - wave amplitude near the n / s interface in the sc side and the higher is the amplitude of the s - wave op , in the normal metal , the larger is the reduction in the @xmath4 amplitude . in this work we report on n / s , point contact differential conductance measurements .",
    "we have analyzed our results using the formalism of kashiwaya et al .",
    "we find , in agreement with the results of ref@xcite , that the curves are best fitted by a dominant d - wave op with an additional siop .",
    "our results are best fitted with a siop having a _ s - wave _ symmetry leading to an op of @xmath4__+is _ _ symmetry .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the siop reaches 60% of the op amplitude , which is considerably higher in comparison to previously reported values .",
    "we attribute this enhancement to a proximity effect between the hts film and the au electrode .",
    "our results are best fitted with low z values ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter , defined by bolnder et al .",
    "@xcite , proportional to the strength of the barrier at the interface .",
    "this indicates that we have produced low reflectivity n / s contacts and thus we expect the proximity effect to be significant .",
    "we find that the amplitude of the siop is indeed a decreasing function of z.",
    "y@xmath9ca@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath10o@xmath11 samples with x=0.05,0.1 and 0.2 were grown by off - axis sputtering . we have used the growth conditions described in ref @xcite to produce , as determined by x - ray diffraction , ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) orientated samples .",
    "sharoni et al.@xcite , using stm topographic scans have shown that ( 110 ) films grown under the same conditions expose ( 100 ) facets .",
    "sem and afm pictures of the ( 001 ) films show a - axis grains on the surface of the film .",
    "thus , in all three cases ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) films , ( 100 ) facets are exposed at the film surface .",
    "ozawa et al.@xcite have studied the electronic properties of the surfaces of ( 110 ) oriented ybco films .",
    "they have found that the degradation time of ( 110 ) facets is significantly smaller than that of ( 100 ) facets .",
    "we therefore expect that the chances of obtaining a metallic contact with a ( 100 ) facet are considerably higher in comparison to a ( 110 ) facet in our films .",
    "the contacts were formed using a mechanically cut au tip mounted on a differential screw .",
    "the measurements were taken in a liquid helium dewar at a temperature of 4.2 k. i / v characteristics were measured digitally and differentiated numerically to yield the differential conducatnce as a function of voltage .",
    "each i / v measurement comprises of two sweeps to check for the absence of heating histerisis effects",
    "figure 1 . shows the result of one of the contacts . one can easily detect two distinct energy scales , see arrows in the figure .",
    "indeed the experimental curve was best fitted with the @xmath4__+is _ _ symmetry where @xmath12=15.9 mev , @xmath13=8.5 mev and z=0.46 .",
    "the other fit parameters are @xmath14 ( corresponding to a ( 100 ) contact ) , @xmath151.7mev ( representing inelastic scattering ) and t=4.2k .",
    "we have performed the integration over the direction of injected electrons from @xmath16 to @xmath17 with equal weight . using the same symmetry of the op",
    "we were able to fit all other 9 contacts by adjusting the values of values of @xmath18 , z and @xmath19 .",
    "some of the curves can be fitted also using a @xmath4__+id__@xmath5 symmetry op , however this requires using a narrow tunneling cone in the fit , which is unreasonable for a metallic , low barrier , contact . as for the @xmath20 op symmetry",
    ", it requires using @xmath21 , thus , we find it less probable , as it fails to explain experimental data obtained for high z contacts @xcite and would suggest that the s - wave channel is stronger than the d - wave one , which is in conflict with the findings of most experimental data @xcite .",
    "figure 2 summarizes our results for the different contacts .",
    "as the films have different critical temperatures , we have plotted the normalized amplitudes of the op components , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a function of z. fig .",
    "shows , that the relative amplitude of the _ is _ component increases from values as low as 0 - 10% for z around 0.7 up to values of around 60 % for z around 0.3 . at the same time the relative amplitude of the d - wave component decreases .",
    "the slope of @xmath24 as a function of z is maximum at z@xmath250.5 .",
    "we see a change from an op which is an almost pure d - wave for the high z contacts to an op , which has almost equal amplitudes of the two components in the low z regime .",
    "to conclude we have shown that our data corresponds to a @xmath4__+is _ _ symmetry , with the value of the siop being a decreasing function of z. the enhancement of the _ is _ component , for high transparency contacts , leads us to conclude that it is a result of a special proximity effect between the normal metal electrode and the d - wave sc , which is much larger than the one predicted by y. ohashi@xcite .",
    "we can explain our data in the following way . as predicted by y.ohashi@xcite , a normal metal in contact with a ( 100 ) boundary of a d - wave sc results in a decrease of the d - wave near the boundary and the appearance of an s - wave symmetry op in the normal metal .",
    "this results in a loss of condensation energy on the sc side .",
    "however if an _ is _ op develops in the d - wave sc in the vicinity of the barrier , as predicted by tanuma et al.@xcite for a ( 110 ) oriented contact , we get a state , which is energetically favorable and still matches the s - wave op on the normal metal side .",
    "therefore we conclude that the d - wave sc has a subdominant s - wave pairing channel , as suggested by fogelstrm et al.@xcite , otherwise the appearance of the _ is _ op would not have been energetically favorable .",
