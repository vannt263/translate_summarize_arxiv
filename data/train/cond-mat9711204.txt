    "in the last decade there has been an enormous interest in metallic phases of matter which are _ not _ fermi liquids .",
    "a paradigm for these is the _ luttinger liquid _ , describing the low - energy , long - wave length limit of gapless electron systems in one dimension ( 1d)@xcite . the luttinger liquid satisfies luttinger s theorem , but the interaction wipes out the quasi - particle pole of the electron propagator , with the disjoint fermi surface ( consisting of two fermi `` points '' @xmath2 ) supporting only collective charge- and spin density excitations .",
    "these excitations are dynamically independent , effectively leading to a spatial separation of the charge and spin of an electron added to the system . as a result ,",
    "spectral properties and dynamical correlations are quite different from those of a fermi liquid@xcite .    the generic low - energy properties of a gapless interacting 1d electron system are well understood@xcite in terms of universal power - laws of correlation functions and spectral functions .",
    "the behavior of such so - called _ luttinger liquids _ is coded in the tomonaga - luttinger model@xcite , much in the same way as the normal state of 3d interacting electrons is patterned on the free fermi gas _ ( landau fermi liquid theory)_. however , it is only in the last few years that laboratory technology has advanced to the point that the notion of a luttinger liquid can be confronted with experiments .",
    "indeed , the ability to manufacture true 1d quantum wires @xcite , as well as the development of high - precision spectroscopic techniques for probing quasi-1d materials @xcite , have provided strong impetus for investigating luttinger liquid physics in realistic contexts . added motivation comes from the realization that the edge excitations of the fractional quantum hall effect can be described in terms of a _ chiral _ luttinger liquid@xcite .",
    "also , some of the `` non - fermi liquid scenarios '' for the normal state properties of the cuprate superconductors draw heavily from luttinger liquid theory , suggesting possible extensions to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "whereas luttinger liquid theory has been successfully used to predict fractional quantum hall edge state transport @xcite , its applicability to the more traditional realm of quasi-1d materials remains controversial .",
    "this class of materials contains organic conductors such as tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ( ttf - tcnq ) and the tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene ( tmtsf)@xmath3x bechgaard salts with @xmath4 etc .",
    "all available information suggests that the physics of these compounds is dominated by strong electron correlations and pronounced one - dimensionality @xcite .",
    "yet , data from nmr @xcite and photoemission spectroscopy @xcite interpreted within a conventional luttinger liquid framework seem to imply single - electron correlations governed by an exponent much larger than can be provided from any realistic lattice hamiltonian ( of which the tomonaga - luttinger model would be the effective low - energy continuum theory ) .",
    "this poses a major problem for the modeling of these materials , and its resolution remains a challenge for the theorist .",
    "one of the basic quantities to consider in this context is the single - particle _ spectral density _ , as this is the object that determines the outcome of a photoemission experiment .",
    "surprisingly , the full calculation of the spectral density of an ideal , infinite volume luttinger liquid was only recently performed @xcite , expanding upon earlier results by suzumura @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we go a step further and investigate the _ local , finite - temperature spectral density _ of a luttinger liquid confined by _ open boundaries _ ( simulating a reflecting barrier or edge potential ) . as photoemission spectroscopy measurements are highly sensitive to boundary effects ( with the photoelectrons traveling only a short distance , of the order of a few lattice spacings from the surface of the sample )",
    ", it is crucial to incorporate an analysis of nontrivial boundary conditions . also , spectroscopy on high - mobility quantum wires doped with artificial impurities ( `` antidots'')@xcite may soon be within experimental reach , adding yet another reason to study this problem : at sufficiently low temperatures a potential scatterer is expected to act essentially as a reflecting barrier@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the exact finite - temperature single - electron green s function and the associated local spectral density of a confined spinful luttinger liquid .",
    "the combined effects of _ boundaries _ and _ finite volume _ will be shown to strongly modify the well - known bulk luttinger liquid spectral density .",
    "in particular , the presence of boundaries causes a novel scaling behavior for energies close to the fermi level , which produce a depletion of spectral weight significantly larger than that for a bulk system , as we have reported for a semi - infinite system at zero temperature before@xcite .",
    "in addition , thermal fluctuations deplete the levels further and give rise to a universal @xmath1 scaling of the spectral density for sufficiently small frequencies @xmath0 , which is analogous to the temperature effects in `` bulk '' systems@xcite .",
    "particular attention is given to the nontrivial zero mode contribution to the correlation function from fluctuations in the spin and charge quantum numbers , which turn out to violate the spin - charge separation ( i.e. the partition function can not be split into separate spin and charge factors ) .",
    "interestingly , the confined system is sensitive to the ratio between the effective velocities for the collective charge- and spin excitations ( which in turn depend on the effective electron - electron coupling ) : as the velocity ratio locks into a rational value the spectrum separates into distinct peaks of equal spacing .",
    "the spacing between the peaks becomes dense for irrational values of the velocity ratios , leading to a quasi - continuous spectrum for large @xmath0 .",
    "this hints at a resonant interference between standing waves of charge and spin for special values of the electron - electron coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce an extended version of the tomonaga - luttinger model and review its bosonization in the presence of open boundaries . in sec .",
    "iii the full finite - temperature green s function in a bounded domain is derived , and the resulting local spectral density is extracted and analyzed in sec .",
    "iv . section  v contains a brief discussion of possible consequences for photoemission experiments , as well as some concluding remarks .",
    "as our model we take an extension of the tomonaga - luttinger hamiltonian@xcite , which describes spinful fermions in one - dimension with a ( repulsive ) local interaction .",
    "all electron - electron interactions must conserve spin and charge , so that we use the most general gapless hamiltonian density that is invariant under the corresponding su(2 ) and u(1 ) symmetries , @xmath5 \\nonumber \\\\    & + &     g_{2 \\perp }   j_{l}^{\\sigma }    j_{r}^{-\\sigma }       \\ + \\",

    "therefore , the energy range around the fermi - surface is limited to a region where a linear approximation of the spectrum is justified .",
    "this is often conveniently illustrated by a cut - off parameter , but more accurately one should take higher order operators in the hamiltonian into account which result in corrections to the linear spectrum which are of higher orders in @xmath10 .",
    "these perturbations have non - universal coefficients which depend on the detailed interactions of the underlying lattice hamiltonian .",
    "the appropriate value of the cut - off parameter ( i.e. the range of validity ) is then determined by the momentum scale at which those corrections become so large that the perturbation series no longer converges .",

    "these materials are composed of molecular chains which become conducting above some characteristic temperature @xmath239 , and are expected to show luttinger liquid behavior provided the temperature is high enough to mask the weak inter - chain coupling . however , as mentioned in the introduction , high - precision photoemission experiments indicate a scaling of spectral weight with frequency that is inconsistent with standard theory of a bulk luttinger liquid : the effective exponent @xmath164 for scaling of the photoemission intensity is roughly 1.25 ( ref . ) as also seen in independent nmr experiments on the same materials @xcite , whereas the largest realistic value obtainable from a _ bulk _ luttinger liquid description is @xmath240 , corresponding to the large - u hubbard chain @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , the actual defect concentration remains unknown , and it is therefore difficult to make a quantitative prediction from our results .",
    "this is an important issue that in principle should be possible to resolve via stm techniques . to explore the size of the boundary effects experimentally , it would also be of great interest to do photoemission experiments on cleaved surfaces that are _ perpendicular _ to the chains that could then be compared to the results from cleaved surfaces parallel to the chains .    as discussed in @xcite ,",

    "<S> = 0.10753we use bosonization methods to calculate the exact finite - temperature single - electron green s function of a spinful luttinger liquid confined by open boundaries . the corresponding local spectral density is constructed and analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between boundary , finite - size and thermal effects are shown to dramatically influence the low - energy properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the well - known zero - temperature critical behavior in the bulk always crosses over to a boundary dominated regime in the vicinity of the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> thermal fluctuations cause an enhanced depletion of spectral weight for small energies @xmath0 , with the spectral density scaling as @xmath1 for @xmath0 much less than the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> consequences for photoemission experiments are discussed . </S>"
