    "heavy quark production in hadronic collisions has received much attention in studying aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) because its large mass sets the scale for perturbative analyses  @xcite . in recent years , productions of quarkonia and open heavy flavor mesons in proton - nucleus ( p@xmath1 )",
    "collisions are investigated from the viewpoint of the gluon saturation in hadrons  @xcite by taking into account the nonlinear evolution effects in the color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) formalism  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "high - energy p@xmath1 collisions can be regarded as a good laboratory for gluon saturation physics : first , the saturation momentum @xmath7 , which separates the nonlinear regime ( @xmath8 ) from the linear regime ( @xmath9 ) of a qcd process with an external scale @xmath10 , is enhanced in the heavy nucleus and at high energies .",
    "this is because the saturation scale is expected to be proportional basically to the gluon density per unit transverse area of the target nucleus and scales as @xmath11 with bjorken s @xmath12 being a longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a gluon and with an empirical parameter @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "second , it is conventionally assumed that no hot and dense quark - gluon medium is formed in p@xmath1 collisions , and thus one can study the initial state effects more directly there collisions  @xcite . ] . at forward",
    "rapidities at the lhc , the relevant @xmath12 values become very small ( @xmath14 ) even for the heavy quark production , and the corresponding saturation scale will be @xmath15 . therefore , besides light hadron productions , heavy quark production can be used as a quantitative probe for the gluon saturation in the target nucleus at the lhc . at the same time",
    ", we note that p@xmath1 collisions provide an important baseline for quantifying the nuclear modification of hadron productions by a quark - gluon medium created in @xmath16 collisions .",
    "open heavy flavor meson productions ( @xmath4 and @xmath17 ) in pp and p@xmath1 collisions were previously evaluated in the cgc framework at mid rapidity at the lhc  @xcite . in the rhic and lhc experiments , the decay leptons  the electrons @xmath18 at mid and the muons @xmath19 at forward rapidity  are also detected for the study of heavy quark production .",
    "importantly , the muon detection is the only observable relevant to the heavy flavor production at forward rapidity in the rhic and lhc experiment setup .",
    "then we need to evaluate the leptonic decays of open heavy flavor mesons ( @xmath20 channel ) in order to study the saturation effects in the observed forward muon spectra . as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can compute the lepton production from the semileptonic decays of the heavy flavor mesons by convoluting the meson production cross - sections with the decay functions .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to quantify in the cgc framework the sensitivity of the single lepton spectra to the small-@xmath12 gluon distribution in the target nucleus .    in the cgc framework ,",
    "the heavy quark pair production cross - section is available analytically at the leading order in the strong coupling constant @xmath21 and at the order @xmath22 for a dilute - dense system , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the color charge density in the proton ( nucleus ) . to this order ,",
    "the physical picture of the pair production is simple : one is the process in which an incoming gluon from the proton splits into a quark pair and the pair is multiply scattered in the target nucleus , and the other is the process in which an incoming gluon is multiply scattered in the target nucleus and then splits into a quark pair .    the multiple scattering of the quark pair in the target in the eikonal approximation is represented by multipoint functions , which obey the so - called jimwlk evolution equation in the rapidity @xmath25  @xcite . in the large-@xmath26 approximation with @xmath26 being the number of colors ,",
    "these general multipoint functions are written in terms of the two - point function ( dipole amplitude ) and the four - point function . especially , the quark - pair production cross - section inclusive in the color degrees is written with the dipole amplitude only .",
    "the rapidity evolution of the dipole amplitude is controlled by the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation  @xcite which sums up the small-@xmath12 quantum corrections of orders @xmath27 in the dilute regime and non - linear effects in the dense regime . at the present day , the bk equation with running coupling kernel ( rcbk )  @xcite is regarded as a useful tool for phenomenologies .",
    "the rcbk equation gives the appropriate evolution speed of the saturation scale @xmath28 .",
    "the initial condition for the dipole amplitude in the rcbk equation is constrained by a global analysis of hera dis data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2",
    ", we first give a brief review of heavy quark production in the cgc framework with the rcbk equation which is utilized in this paper .",
    "then , we introduce a decay distribution function for describing the semileptonic decay of heavy mesons .",
    "after that , in sec .  3 , we show the results of single lepton production spectra and its nuclear modification factor .",
    "in the cgc framework , the heavy quark pair production cross - section at the leading order in @xmath21 with the transverse momentum @xmath29 and rapidity @xmath30 of the ( anti- ) quark in minimum bias events of a dilute - dense system ( e.g. , p@xmath1 ) is given in the large-@xmath26 limit as  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the unintegrated gluon distribution function of the proton and the three - point function of the nucleus , respectively ( see fig .  [ lo - diagrams ] ) .",
    "the values of bjorken s @xmath12 on the proton and nucleus sides , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , are determined in the @xmath38 kinematics as @xmath39 with the transverse mass @xmath40 .. ] the relevant hard matrix element @xmath41 can be found in ref .",
    "the integrand depends on two transverse momenta , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , on the nucleus side , by which the @xmath44-factorization is broken in a strict sense  @xcite . with this caution in mind , we call this formula @xmath44-factorized formula in a generalized version",
    ".    in the forward rapidity region , where @xmath36 becomes large while @xmath37 is much smaller , we can use the hybrid formula  @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the collinear gluon distribution function with @xmath19 being factorization scale .",
    "since we work at the leading order in @xmath21 , @xmath19 here should be regarded as a model parameter .",
    "the explicit expression for the hard matrix element @xmath47 after the collinear approximation done on the proton side can be found in ref .",
    ".    the single heavy quark production cross - section is obtained by integrating the pair production cross - section over the phase space of the anti - quark : @xmath48    the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath49 of the proton is expressed in terms of the fourier transform of the dipole amplitude @xmath50 in the adjoint representation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the evolution rapidity measured from @xmath53 , and the transverse geometry of the proton is replaced with the effective transverse area @xmath54 . in the large-@xmath26 limit , the adjoint dipole amplitude reduces to the square of the fundamental dipole amplitude in the coordinate space , and therefore @xmath55 with @xmath56 the collinear gluon distribution function of the proton @xmath57 is obtained by integrating @xmath58 over the transverse momentum @xmath44 up to the factorization scale @xmath19 : @xmath59 we note here that @xmath58 is different from the unintegrated gluon distribution function in a strict sense because the former includes higher twist effects .",
