    "]    at first sight it might seem as if theorem [ t : trans ] can not possibly hold .",
    "after all , a large cycle of @xmath5 ( say of size @xmath33 ) is necessarily contained in the giant component of a corresponding erds - rnyi graph @xmath34 with edge density @xmath2 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath17 is the first time that the giant component has a relative size which exceeds @xmath35 , so it is clear that @xmath16 must be close to 0 before @xmath17 .",
    "what theorem [ t : trans ] says is that @xmath16 suddenly reaches its equilibrium value precisely at that time , and does not change afterward .",
    "note however that as @xmath2 increases above @xmath17 , the cluster continues to grow .",
    "( see figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "so how come the probability for a cycle of size exactly @xmath36 does not grow with it ?",
    "the answer lies in examining a completely random permutation .",
    "the expected number of cycles of length @xmath1 in a random permutation of @xmath4 elements is exactly @xmath37 and hence _ does not depend on @xmath4 _ , of course , as long as @xmath38 .",
    "this explains why the size of the giant component does not affect @xmath39 , as long as it is bigger than @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : trans ] follows by estimating the terms in theorem [ t : exact ] carefully .",
    "let us just remark how the phase transition comes about .",
    "the integrand in theorem [ t : exact ] ( i.e.  @xmath40 ) has a peak at exactly the critical value @xmath17 .",
    "so in the subcritical case ( i.e.  @xmath2 small so @xmath41 large ) , @xmath42 can be estimated simply by @xmath43 , which is small . in the supercritical case ( i.e.  @xmath41 small ) , the integral",
    "is estimated by writing it as @xmath44 .",
    "the integral from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is easy to calculate , and gives the @xmath37 term , and the integral from 0 to @xmath41 is the error term .    from this we can derive a new proof of the result , first proved by schramm @xcite , that giant cycles ( of macroscopic size ) emerge at time @xmath45 with high probability asymptotically as @xmath15 .",
    "[ t : gc ] let @xmath46 and let @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the length of the largest cycle of @xmath5 .",
    "then as @xmath49 , @xmath50    schramm s results are stronger and also give information about the _",
    "joint _ distribution of cycles , e.g.  what is the probability that the largest cycle is in @xmath51 $ ] and the second largest is in @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we will not discuss the joint distribution in this paper .",
    "theorem [ t : gc ] is the mean - field case of a well - known conjecture of blint tth @xcite that the cycle structure of the interchange process on the graph @xmath53 , exhibits a phase - transition with infinite cycles appearing at some finite time ( see e.g. @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "this paper was initially motivated by the desire to see if it would be possible to use a representation - theoretic approach to this conjecture .",
    "our proof of theorem [ t : gc ] can be seen as the mean - field case of this programme ( see also theorem 1 of @xcite for a possible alternative route , which yields a slightly weaker conclusion ) . let us remark that the recent resolution of aldous spectral gap conjecture @xcite could aid one in an algebraic attack on the non - mean - field case .",
    "interestingly , the asymptotics leading to the transition in theorems [ t : trans ] and [ t : gc ] do _ not _ come from the contribution of a single representation of @xmath6 with all other contributions being negligible .",
    "rather , it is the result of some very remarkable cancelations when summing up over all representations of @xmath6 .",
    "these cancelations lead to the simple formula of theorem [ t : exact ] . here",
    "it is essential to have an exact computation that keeps track of _ all _ representation in order to establish the emergence of giant cycles of theorem [ t : gc ] .",
    "nevertheless , if one wants only weaker results , e.g.  that whenever @xmath54 we already have @xmath55 exponentially small , then in this case a single representation ( the trivial one , @xmath56 $ ] ) gives the main contribution , with the contribution of all the others combined negligible .",
    "in other words , ignoring the cancelation between representations will cause the information about the sharpness of the phase transition to be lost , but one may still show the existence of an `` ordered phase '' .    finally , we show how our formula allows us to recover a result of berestycki and durrett @xcite concerning a slowdown transition for the interchange process .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath58 , i.e. , the minimal number of transpositions needed to write @xmath5 as a product of transpositions .",
    "( if one views @xmath5 as a random walk on the cayley graph of @xmath6 generated by the set of transpositions , then @xmath57 is the graph distance between @xmath5 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "[ t : slowdown ] let @xmath59 and let @xmath60 .",
    "then as @xmath15 , @xmath61    the asymptotic behaviour was first obtained in theorem 3 of @xcite .",
    "it is known that for @xmath62 , the function @xmath63 simplifies to @xmath64 while for @xmath46 , @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath66 is @xmath67 everywhere except at @xmath68 , for which @xmath69 .",
    "this result is indicative of a slowdown transition , in the following sense : so long as @xmath62 , the random walk escapes from the origin at maximum speed ( i.e. , all but a negligible fraction of moves take it away from the origin ) , while for @xmath46 the random walk starts decelerating brutally  indeed , the acceleration is @xmath70 at @xmath68 .",
    "the methods of @xcite relied heavily on the use of an associated erds - renyi random graph process , and more precise results were obtained ( e.g. , a central limit theorem for @xmath57 ) .",
    "however we will see that the formula is obtained with essentially no effort from our theorem [ t : exact ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that theorem [ t : slowdown ] is derived by applying theorem [ t : exact ] for constant @xmath1 , unlike theorems [ t : trans ] and [ t : gc ] for which the relevant regime is @xmath71 .",
    "it would be interesting to find applications of our formula in other regimes of @xmath1 , for example @xmath72 .",
    "for a permutation @xmath73 , let @xmath74 denote the number of cycles of size @xmath1 of @xmath73 , and @xmath75 . for a representation @xmath76 of @xmath6 , let @xmath77 be its character , i.e. , @xmath78 note that @xmath79 is a class function .",
    "hence , since characters form an orthonormal basis of class functions ( see , e.g. , proposition 1.10.2 in @xcite ) there exists @xmath80 such that @xmath81 where the sum is over irreducible representations @xmath82 . in @xcite the value of @xmath83 for all representations",
    "@xmath82 was worked out . to describe this result we need to recall some standard background in the representation theory of the symmetric group .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath6 are parametrized by young diagrams of size @xmath4 , that is , sequences @xmath84 $ ] with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which may be thought of as a collection of boxes sitting on top of one another , with @xmath87 boxes in row @xmath88 .",
    "see @xcite for the details of this parameterization ( we will not use it directly in this paper ) .",
    "as it turns out , there are very few young diagrams for which the corresponding coefficient @xmath83 defined by is nonzero . to state things as simply as",
    "possible , we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath89 ( the other case is similar and we come back to this later ) .",
    "consider the representation @xmath90 $ ] where @xmath91 indicates that there are @xmath88 rows with exactly one box .",
    "then theorem 3 of @xcite states that @xmath83 is zero unless @xmath92 for some @xmath93 , in which case @xmath83 is simply equal to @xmath94 , or @xmath95 $ ] the trivial representation , in which case @xmath96 .",
    "[ l : repres ] for a representation @xmath82 , let @xmath97 be the character ratio of @xmath82 , i.e. , when @xmath98 is any transposition , @xmath99 is the character of @xmath82 at @xmath98 , and @xmath100 is the dimension of @xmath82 . then @xmath101    to compute @xmath9 , let @xmath102 be the infinitesimal generator of the random walk .",
    "that is , viewing @xmath102 as an element of the group algebra @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 $ ] ( here , @xmath105 denotes the transposition of @xmath88 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the identity permutation ) .",
    "thus , @xmath108 say .",
    "then @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath111 at @xmath82 .",
    "note that @xmath112 . since convolutions become ( matrix )",
    "products after taking fourier transform , we get@xmath113 where the second @xmath114 is a matrix exponential . now note that @xmath115 is constant on conjugacy classes , i.e. , is a class function ( here is where we use that we do the interchange process on the complete graph , and not on any other graph ) .",
    "it easily follows from schur s lemma that @xmath116 for some @xmath117 , and thus we conclude that @xmath118 to obtain the constant @xmath119 we proceed as follows : on the one hand we have @xmath120 , so @xmath121 . on the other hand , @xmath122 $ ] so by linearity of the trace , @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the character of @xmath98 evaluated at an arbitrary transposition ( again , it is not important which one , since characters are class functions ) . hence ,",
    "dividing by @xmath100 , we get @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the character ratio at a transposition . combining , and , we have arrived at @xmath127 as needed .",
    "we start by recalling frobenius s formula , which gives the values of the character ratios for any representation .",
    "suppose @xmath82 is parametrized by the young tableau @xmath129 , then ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation @xmath130 , p.  40 ) or",
    "* lemma 7 ) ) , @xmath131 thus if @xmath132 is the representation given by @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath93 , then @xmath133 notice the cancelation of the terms in @xmath134 , which is crucial for the following calculations .",
    "we now plug these various expressions into . recall that @xmath138 when @xmath139 , and @xmath96 when @xmath140 is the trivial representation @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "we obtain the following expression , after rearranging the terms ( mostly to isolate the @xmath88-independent terms and take them out of the sum ) .",
    "let @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath143 where @xmath144 to compute the right - hand side of , note that @xmath145 , hence @xmath146 say .",
    "this can be simplified a little bit .",
    "observe indeed that @xmath147 on the other hand , @xmath148 , so we are led to the following exact expression for @xmath16 : with @xmath149 , @xmath150.\\ ] ] recalling the notation @xmath40 from the statement of the theorem , we can rewrite this shortly as @xmath151.\\ ] ] the theorem is basically finished : we only need the following simple transformation :      denote @xmath153 the integral from 0 to 1 is just the beta integral , so @xmath154 for completeness , here is a short proof : fubini s theorem shows that for every @xmath155 , @xmath156 , hence after a change of variables @xmath157 , @xmath158 , so that @xmath159 , we get @xmath160 hence @xmath161 as required .      thus the @xmath163 from lemma [ lem:0xx1 ] cancels with the @xmath164 in ( [ e : from0 ] ) and leads us to @xmath165\\ ] ] ( with @xmath166 as in the proof of lemma [ lem:0xx1 ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem [ t : exact ] in the case @xmath89 .",
    "the calculation in this case is very similar to the one in the previous case .",
    "in fact , we find the similarity eerie and needing of explanation .",
    "what we will show is that ( [ e(sk)2 ] ) holds , which means that all the calculation from ( [ e(sk)2 ] ) on holds as is , including the conclusion of the theorem .",
    "so we only need to show ( [ e(sk)2 ] ) .",
    "recall from @xcite that if @xmath167 , the representations that arise in the character decomposition of @xmath168 are of two types : for @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 $ ] , for which @xmath171 , while for @xmath172 , we have @xmath90 $ ] coming with a coefficient @xmath173 .",
    "note in particular , that for @xmath174 , the representation and the coefficient is formally identical to those used in the case @xmath128 , and hence the corresponding dimension and character ratio are still given ( formally ) by the same expressions and .",
    "note also that there is no representation associated with @xmath175 .    for @xmath176",
    ", consider the representation @xmath170 $ ] for which the coefficient is @xmath177 .",
    "then a calculation using frobenius character formula shows ( still keeping the notation @xmath178 ) , @xmath179 comparing with , observe that this is exactly the same expression .    it remains to compute @xmath180 . in order to do",
    "so we use again the hook length formula , which gives us the following ( see figure [ fig : hook2 ] ) : @xmath181 formally , this is once again exactly the same result as in case @xmath128 but with a minus sign .",
    "but since in this case @xmath171 instead of @xmath94 , the two minus signs cancel out and the formula which computes @xmath16 is _ exactly the same _ , except for the fact that there is no term corresponding to @xmath182 . however , observe that the term in ( [ e(sk)2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath183 is zero , so it does nothing to the sum when we keep it .",
    "we need to estimate the terms appearing in theorem [ t : exact ] . for this",
    "we denote @xmath186 and @xmath187 where @xmath166 is as in the previous section . with these definitions @xmath188 ( the reason for taking one @xmath41 out of @xmath189 is technical",
    " it allows us to use the same notations for the estimate of @xmath189 and of @xmath190 , nothing more ) .",
    "another useful notation would be @xmath191 so that the @xmath41-dependent term in @xmath189 is @xmath192 and the integrand in @xmath193 is @xmath194 .",
    "note that @xmath195 has a unique maximum over @xmath196 $ ] , attained at @xmath197 .",
    "the key lemma is the following estimate :      we start by defining @xmath202 and then @xmath203 to bound @xmath204 we first assume that @xmath205 and get @xmath206 where we have used for the first log the fact that for @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and for the second log simply @xmath209 . to remove the restriction on @xmath210 , note that @xmath195 is monotone increasing over @xmath211 $ ] and monotone decreasing over @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "so we can write @xmath213 , for all @xmath210 .    on the other hand , from stirling s formula",
    "it is easy to see that there exists a universal constant @xmath28 such that for all @xmath4 and all @xmath214 , @xmath215 combining and we get @xmath216 multiplying further by @xmath3 , we get the claimed bound on @xmath189 in lemma [ lem : b1 ] .",
    "* case 2 : * @xmath227 with @xmath221 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , here we will lemma [ lem:0xx1 ] , which gives us @xmath228 and this time , since @xmath195 is monotone increasing over @xmath229 $ ] we conclude that @xmath230 so that @xmath231 .",
    "fix @xmath242 and let @xmath243 .",
    "it follows that @xmath244 indeed , @xmath245 gives that @xmath246 and with @xmath247 we get ( [ e : tnkcn ] ) .",
    "hence by theorem [ t : trans ] , noting that @xmath248 for any @xmath249 in this range , @xmath250 for some @xmath251 depending on @xmath252 and @xmath27 . summing up between @xmath253 and @xmath254 , we get @xmath255 the lemma follows immediately by letting @xmath15 , since @xmath32 was arbitrarily close to @xmath256 .      let @xmath259 be the ( random ) graph where there is an edge @xmath105 if and only if the transposition @xmath105 has occurred prior to @xmath2 . then @xmath259 is a realization of @xmath260 with @xmath261 .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known and easy to see that any cycle of @xmath5 is a subset of some connected component of @xmath259 . by the erds - renyi theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is known that on an event of high probability , @xmath259 has only one component greater than @xmath262 ( the giant component ) and thus @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the rescaled size of the largest component . furthermore , the same papers show @xmath265 in probability , where @xmath266 is the survival probability of a poisson @xmath267 galton - watson process .",
    "hence @xmath268 and the lemma follows .",
    "recall that the theorem states that a cycle @xmath269 exists with high probability .",
    "consider the random variable @xmath270 .",
    "then @xmath271 is bounded by 2 , nonnegative with high probability ( from the galton - watson argument ) , and has expectation bounded by @xmath272 ( from lemma [ lem : massgc ] ) .",
    "hence by markov s inequality @xmath273 for all @xmath4 sufficiently large . on the complement event @xmath274 and hence @xmath275 , in which case the length of the longest cycle is @xmath276 .",
    "since @xmath210 was arbitrary , theorem [ t : gc ] follows .",
    "recall that we wish to estimate @xmath57 , the graph distance to @xmath277 .",
    "let @xmath278 denote the number of cycles of @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known and easy to check that @xmath279 .",
    "let @xmath218 and fix @xmath280 . then observe that , since there can never be more than @xmath281 cycles greater than @xmath282 , @xmath283 thus theorem [ t : slowdown ] follows from the claim : for all fixed @xmath284 , and all @xmath59 , if @xmath60 , @xmath285 for this we apply theorem [ t : exact ] with these values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and note that @xmath286 satisfies @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 ( the notation @xmath290 is short for @xmath291 , here and below ) .",
