    "in the past two decades , the main focus of the cellular access engineering was on the efficient support of human - oriented services , like voice calls , messaging , web browsing and video streaming services .",
    "a common feature of these services is seen in the relatively low number of simultaneous connections that require high data rates . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent rise of m2 m communications introduced a paradigm shift and brought into research focus fundamentally new challenges .",
    "particularly , m2 m communications involve a massive number of low - rate connections , which is a rather new operating mode , not originally considered in the cellular radio access .",
    "smart metering is a showcase m2 m application consisting of a massive number of devices , up to @xmath1@xcite , where meters periodically report energy consumption to a remote server for control and billing purposes . on the other hand ,",
    "the report size is small , of the order of @xmath2 bytes @xcite .",
    "the current cellular access mechanisms , considering all the associated overhead , can not support this kind of operation @xcite .",
    "there are on - going efforts in 3gpp that deal with the cellular access limitations , investigating methods for decreasing the access overhead for small data transmissions @xcite , access overload control @xcite and guaranteed quality of service @xcite .",
    "besides lte , @xcite proposes an allocation method for reports with deadlines in gprs / edge , showing that up to @xmath3 devices can be effectively supported in a single cell by avoiding random access and using a periodic structure to serve the devices such that the deadlines are met .    in this letter",
    ", we consider a system with a periodically occurring pool of resources that are reserved m2 m communications and shared for uplink transmission by all m2 m devices .",
    "the re - occurring period is selected such that if a report is transmitted successfully within the upcoming resource pool , then the reporting deadline is met .",
    "we note that , if each device has a deterministic number of packets to transmit in each resource pool and if there are no packet errors , then the problem is trivial , because a fixed number of resources can be pre - allocated periodically to each device .",
    "however , if the number of packets , accumulated between two reporting instances , is random and the probability of packet error is not zero , then the number of transmission resources required per device in each transmission period is random . on the other hand , as the number of transmission resources in each instance of the resource pool is fixed , the following question arises : _ how many periodically reporting devices can be supported with a desired reliability of report delivery ( i.e. , @xmath0% ) , for a given number of resources reserved for m2 m communications ? _ we elaborate and analyze the proposed approach in lte context ; however , the presented ideas are generic and implementable in other systems where many devices report to a single base station or access point .",
    "the rest of the letter is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] presents the system model .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] is devoted to the analysis of the proposed access method .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the numerical results and section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the letter .",
    "we focus on the case of periodic reporting , where the length of the reporting interval ( ri ) , denoted by @xmath4 , depends on the application requirements @xcite .",
    "the m2 m resources for uplink transmission are reserved to occur periodically , at the end of each ri .",
    "the periodic reporting is typically modeled either as a poisson process with arrival rate @xmath5 , where devices can actually send none , one , or multiple reports within ri , or as a uniform distribution , where devices send a single packet per ri @xcite .",
    "our analysis will focus on the former case , but we note that the derived results can be readily applied to the latter arrival model , as well .",
    "we assume that all report arrivals that occur within the current reporting interval are served in the next reporting interval .",
    "the lte access combines tdma and fdma , such that access resources are represented in 2d , see fig .",
    "[ lte_grid ] .",
    "as depicted , time is organized in frames , where each frame is composed of subframes with duration @xmath6  ms .",
    "the minimum amount of uplink resources that can be allocated to a device is one resource block ( rb ) , corresponding to a single subframe and 12-subcarriers in frequency .",
    "we assume that the uplink resources are split into two pools , one reserved for m2 m services ( depicted in blue in fig .",
    "[ lte_grid ] ) , and the other used for other services .",
    "note that the approach of splitting the resources for m2 m and non - m2 m has often been used @xcite , as their requirements are fundamentally different .",
    "finally , we assume that there is a set of @xmath7 rbs reserved for m2 m resource pool in each subframe .",
    "the m2 m resource pool is divided into two parts , denoted as the preallocated and common pool , which reoccur with period @xmath4 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ preallocated]a ) .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath8 reporting devices , and each device is preallocated an amount of rbs from the preallocated pool dimensioned to accommodate a single report and an indication if there are more reports , termed excess reports , from the same device to be transmitted within the same interval .",
    "the common pool is used to allocate resources for the excess reports , as well as all the retransmissions of the reports / packets that were erroneously received .",
    "these resources can only be reactively allocated and in our case we consider the lte data transmission scheme , where each transmission has an associated feedback that can be used to allocate the resources from the common pool  ms ( @xmath9 subframes ) , which includes processing times at the base station and at the device , and which can be assumed negligible taking into account that the ri that we are considering is of the order of thousands subframes . ] .",

    "the analysis how to determine @xmath12 , given the constraints of the required number of rbs per report , number of devices and reliability , is the pivotal contribution of the letter and presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "finally , we note that the duration of @xmath10 has a direct impact on the delay ; in the worst case a ( successful ) report is delivered @xmath15 seconds after its arrival , which also defines the delivery deadline .",
    "denote by @xmath16 a random variable that models the total number of transmissions of report @xmath17 from device @xmath18 ; i.e. , @xmath16 includes the first transmission and any subsequent retransmissions that may occur due to reception failures .",
    "further , assume that the maximum value of @xmath16 is limited to @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is a system parameter , applicable to all reports from all devices .",
    "the probability mass function ( pmf ) of @xmath16 can be modeled as a geometric distribution truncated at @xmath19 : @xmath20=\\left\\ {            \\begin{array}{l l }              p_e^{k-1 }   ( 1-p_e ) , &   1 \\leq k \\leq l-1 , \\\\",

    "recall that the reporting of device @xmath18 is modeled as a poisson process @xmath22 with arrival rate @xmath23 , where the device can send none ( @xmath24 ) , one ( @xmath25 ) or multiple reports ( @xmath26 ) within ri .",
    "as stated above , the first transmission of the first report of a device is sent in the preallocated pool , while all subsequent transmissions take place in the common pool .",
