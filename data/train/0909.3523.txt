    "supersymmetry  ( susy ) is an attractive mechanism to stabilize the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking against large quantum corrections from unknown high - energy physics .",
    "however , to be phenomenologically viable susy must be broken at low energies .",
    "one class of models that can achieve this in an acceptable manner are theories of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking  ( gmsb ) where supersymmetry breaking occurs in a _ hidden sector _ , and is communicated to the _ visible sector _ containing the supermultiplets of standard model  ( sm ) particles through gauge interactions with a set of _ gauge messenger _ particles  @xcite .",
    "gauge mediation leads to experimental signatures that are very different from other forms of susy breaking , such as gravity and anomaly mediation , when the gauge messengers are very light relative to the planck scale . in this case ,",
    "the lightest superpartner particle  ( lsp ) is generally the gravitino , and is stable in the presence of @xmath5-parity ( which we assume in the present work).-parity is one simple way to forbid dangerous operators that can lead to rapid proton decay . ]",
    "the lightest standard model superpartner will then decay to a gravitino and one or more sm states .",
    "for example , if the lightest sm superpartner is a mostly - bino neutralino , it can decay to a photon and gravitino .",
    "such decays can be prompt on collider time scales for gauge messenger masses below about @xmath6 .",
    "the distinctive photon - rich collider signatures of this scenario have been studied in a number of works such as refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these previous studies of low - scale gauge mediation focused mainly on a minimal class of gmsb models . however , more recent investigations of gmsb scenarios have illustrated that a much broader range of superpartner spectra are possible within more general realizations of this mechanism  @xcite . with the tevatron running and the lhc about to start up , it is therefore interesting to consider new and unusual collider signatures that can emerge in this context  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we investigate a novel higgs boson signature within the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) that can potentially arise in generalized gmsb models , but is impossible in minimal gmsb scenarios .",
    "the signature that we discuss arises from the decays of a sm - like higgs boson to pairs of the lightest neutralinos .",
    "each neutralino is assumed to subsequently decay promptly to a photon and a stable gravitino , @xmath7 , giving rise to a collider signature consisting of two photons and missing energy  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this decay mode does not occur in standard scenarios of gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking because in that case the lightest neutralino is ( meta-)stable and can only produce an invisible higgs signature  @xcite .",
    "this decay channel is also impossible in minimal mssm gmsb models since the lightest neutralino is constrained to be heavier than half the mass of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "however , higgs boson decays to pairs of unstable neutralinos can potentially arise in generalized gmsb constructions . to the best of our knowledge",

    "we begin by investigating the bounds on light neutralinos that decay promptly to a photon and a gravitino from existing particle collider data .",
    "motivated by recent progress in non - minimal gmsb models , we consider very general low - energy superpartner spectra ( with a light gravitino ) that do not necessarily fit into the paradigm of minimal gmsb .",
    "the strongest parameter bounds are found to come from the lep experiments and the tevatron searches for direct neutralino and chargino production in low - scale gmsb .",

    "see @xcite and @xcite for further discussion and four - component versions of these formulae .",
    "the results of lep  i and ii and the tevatron place bounds primarily on the couplings of neutralinos and charginos to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "these constraints imply that in order for the lightest mssm neutralino to be light enough to allow superpartner higgs decays , it must be mostly bino since significant higgsino or wino components lead to overly large gauge boson couplings ( and unacceptably light charginos ) .",
    "the bino , coming from @xmath20 , avoids such couplings due to its abelian nature .",
    "this is reflected in the absence of @xmath21 in the gauge boson couplings listed in eq .  .",
    "however , for the lightest neutralino to couple to the higgs , it must have at least some higgsino content . from the expressions for higgs - neutralino and neutralino - gauge boson couplings",
    ", one sees that two higgsino ( or wino ) mixing factors are required for a mostly bino state to couple to a @xmath22 gauge boson , whereas only one is needed to couple to the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "it is this feature that will allow the higgs to decay significantly to a bino - like neutralino in the mssm without contradicting lep constraints .",
    "the most constraining lep searches for a light neutralino decaying promptly to a photon are those looking for di - photon final states .",
    "lep  ii has searched for di - photons and missing energy up to @xmath23 , which limits @xmath24  @xcite .",

    "we expect the acceptance for @xmath29 to be similar for @xmath30 with @xmath7 , and we therefore apply the same bound here .",
    "in addition to bounds on the neutralino , the lightest chargino must typically be heavier than @xmath31 to be consistent with the lep data  @xcite .",
    "light neutralinos that decay promptly to a photon and a gravitino are also strongly constrained by tevatron searches for gmsb .",
    "these searches performed by the cdf and @xmath32 experiments concentrate on @xmath29 final states .",
    "their results are presented in terms of bounds on the specific sps8 gmsb snowmass point  @xcite , corresponding to minimal gauge mediation with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 a free parameter , and @xmath36 .",
    "given their focus on this specific point , their results do not always apply to more general scenarios , but we expect their bounds to carry over to the present case . the dominant susy production mode for the sps8 point at the tevatron is direct electroweak chargino and neutralino creation . in our numerical scans below , we will effectively decouple all the superpartners other than the bino and the higgsinos , and electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos will again be the dominant tevatron susy production mode .",
    "the primary significant difference between the spectrum we will study and that of sps8 is that our lightest neutralino will be much lighter for a given higgsino mass .",
    "this may change the decay cascades of the heavier chargino and neutralino states . however , since the tevatron searches concentrate on the @xmath29 signature , the nature of these cascades should not alter the bounds very much .",

    "this corresponds to a @xmath163 discovery with about @xmath164 of data , and the prospects will improve even further once the backgrounds are restricted to lie within the signal acceptance window .",
    "note that this is considerably better than the estimated significance for the direct di - photon channel  @xcite due to the larger signal rate .",
    "more generally , we expect that any search channel that uses relatively weak photon @xmath124 requirements along with an additional handle to remove backgrounds will be effective for searching for di - photons from @xmath99 .",
    "other examples include vbf and @xmath165 associated production .    one additional strategy that could prove useful is to make use the ability of atlas to reconstruct photon `` tracks '' . using the ecal alone ,",
    "the primary di - photon vertex can be identified to within about @xmath166 along the beam axis  @xcite . however , a significant fraction of hard photons interact with material in the trackers and _ convert _ to an @xmath167 pair .",
    "a converted photon can therefore give rise to charged tracks allowing for a very precise determination of the primary photon vertex position .",
    "estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest this determination could be as good as @xmath168 .",
    "this is useful in regular higgs searches for determining the location of primary interaction vertex . in the case of neutralino",
    "decays to gravitinos and photons in low - scale gauge mediation , vertexing the products of double photon conversions might allow for a measurement of the neutralino lifetime , even when the neutralino decays are otherwise `` prompt '' .",
    "decays of a sm - like higgs boson to a pair of neutralinos , each of which subsequently decays to a photon and a gravitino , can arise in generalized gauge - mediated supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "this channel leads to a signal consisting of a di - photon pair plus missing energy at high energy colliders . in the present work we have investigated this possibility within the mssm , and we find that neutralino branching fractions of the higgs as large as @xmath60 can be consistent with existing collider bounds . for branching fractions not too far below this upper bound , both the tevatron and the lhc",
    "can potentially observe the higgs boson through this non - standard decay channel .",
    "the most promising tevatron searches for this higgs mode look for di - photon events with a small amount of missing energy , much like in the existing @xmath32 searches for gmsb .",
    "our preliminary analysis suggests that evidence for the higgs boson can be obtained with @xmath111 of data .",
    "improvements in detection efficiencies and optimized analysis techniques making use of shape information in the @xmath169 plane could potentially lead to a discovery , although a more careful analysis by the collaborations is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn .    at the lhc",
    ", this unusual higgs boson decay channel can be probed efficiently in associated production channels that use relatively mild cuts on the photon momenta .",
    "inclusive production with a mild @xmath8 cut may also be useful for probing this decay mode , though in this case a more careful study of the backgrounds is required . in principle , the neutralino mass can be determined from the endpoint of the di - photon mass distribution in this channel once the higgs boson mass is known .",
    "photon conversions may also provide information about the lifetime of the unstable neutralino and the mass of the gravitino",
    ".    in the present work we have focused on higgs decays to neutralinos in the mssm , but even more possibilities can arise in extensions with additional singlets  @xcite . in this case",
    "the higgs boson can potentially have significant branching ratios to any neutralinos that are mostly bino or singlino .",
    "depending on the precise spectrum and pattern of mixing angles , various signatures involving photons and missing energy are possible .",
    "another interesting possibility occurs if the spectrum also contains a light pseudoscalar @xmath170 , allowing for example the decays @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "this could lead to collider signatures similar to those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with modified kinematics and missing energy .",
    "we hope to study these possibilities in a future work  @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize the importance of searching broadly for new physics in upcoming collider data . in the present analysis we have found that in many cases cuts imposed while optimizing searches for new physics in other channels also cut out the majority of the signal in the non - standard higgs channel we are interested in . given the wide variety of possibilities for new physics beyond the standard model , we feel that it is most prudent to cast our experimental nets as widely as practicable .",
