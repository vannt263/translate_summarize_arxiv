    "magnetic nanoparticles ( mnps ) are minute parts of magnetic materials with typical size well below @xmath0 .",
    "they are present in different materials found in nature such as rocks , living organisms , ceramics and corrosion products , but they are also artificially made and used as the active component of ferrofluids , permanent magnets , soft magnetic materials , biomedical materials and catalysts .",
    "their diverse applications in geology , physics chemistry , biology and medicine renders the study of their properties of great importance both to science and technology .    in geology ,",
    "the nature and origin of magnetic phenomena related to the presence of magnetite nanoparticles in rocks is of great interest to the palaeomagnetist who searches for the geomagnetic record of rocks .",
    "the presence of magnetite particles associated with the trigeminal nerve in pigeons offers a reliable explanation to the earth s magnetic field detection and the consequent navigation capability .",
    "in fine arts , magnetic analysis of ancient paintings facilitates the reconstruction of the production techniques of ancient ceramics . in living organisms , the role of ferritin , a magnetic nanoparticle per se , is important among the iron storage proteins .",
    "mnps are also used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "recent work has involved the development of bioconjugated mnps , which facilitated specific targeting of these mri probes to brain tumors .",
    "mnps are also used as highly active catalysts which has long been demonstrated by the the use of finely divided metals in several reactions .",
    "owing to their high surface - to - volume ratio mnps of iron are more efficient at waste remediation than bulk iron .",
    "high density magnetic data storage media provide a major technological driving force for further exploration of mnps .",
    "it is expected that if mnps with diameter @xmath1 can be used as individually addressed magnetic bits , magnetic data storage densities of @xmath2 would be achieved , namely an order of magnitude higher than the present record ( moser 2002 ) .",
    "mnps have also been demonstrated to be functional elements in magneto - optical switches , sensors based on giant magneto - resistance and magnetically controllable single electron transistor devices .    the most common preparation methods for mnps produce assemblies with different structural and compositional characteristics that depend on the particular method adopted .",
    "granular films , ferrofluids and cluster - assembled films are characterized as assemblies with random order in mnp locations , while ordered arrays are found in patterned media ( known also as magnetic dots ) and self - assembled films .",
    "the mnp preparation methods are divided to top - down and bottom - up . in top - down methods ,",
    "the nps are formed from a larger system by appropriate physical processing , such as thermal treatment , etching , etc . in bottom - up methods ,",
    "the nps are formed by an atomic nucleation process that takes place either in ultrahigh vacuum or in a liquid environment .",
    "the latter method relies on colloidal chemistry techniques and presently appears to be the most promising method for production of nanoparticles with extremely narrow size distribution .",
    "colloidal synthesis methods combined with self - assembly methods produce mnp samples with both size uniformity and long range structural order .",
    "it is worth noticing that structural order in a mnp assembly is a decisive property for production of ultrahigh density storage media .",
    "owing to their attractive features and their low cost , colloidal synthesis methods and self - assembly attract presently intense research activity in the field of mnp preparation ( petit 1998 , murray 2001 , willard 2004 , farrell 2005 , darling 2005 ) .",
    "the magnetic properties of mnps and their assemblies provide a fascinating field for basic research , which is done on two different scales , the atomic and the mesoscopic . in the atomic scale , the properties of individual mnps are examined and they are revealed in samples with low particle concentration . in the mesoscopic scale ,",
    "dense samples are examined which exhibit collective magnetic behavior arising from interparticle interactions .",
    "the study of the magnetic properties can be naturally divided in the investigation of the ground state configuration ( long range order , disorder , etc ) and the excitations from it .",
    "excitations can be either weak , as for example at low temperature and weak external magnetic field , or strong , as for example , close to a thermal phase transition or under a reversing magnetic field .",
    "for individual mnps the ground state configuration can differ remarkably from the parent bulk material in various ways .",
    "for example , owing to energy balance reasons , the abundance of magnetic domains that form in a bulk magnet can be replaced by a single domain in a mnp , which then becomes magnetically saturated even in the absence of an external magnetic field ( nel 1949 ) . the application of an external field forces the atomic magnetic moments of a single - domain mnp to rotate coherently ( stoner 1948 ) .",
    "also , for temperature above a threshold , the direction of particle s magnetization fluctuates at random , making the particle bahave as a molecule with a giant magnetic moment .",
    "the applications of this effect , known as superparamagnetism ( bean 1959 ) , are presently a lot , ranging from geology to medicine .",
    "finally , we should remark that the above described simplified picture of a single - domain mnp becomes invalid if one considers the crucial effect of the mnp surface .",
    "reduced crystal symmetry and chemical disorder close to the surface can produce variations between the surface and interior magnetic structure and modify the overall response of the mnp to an applied field ( kodama 1999 ) .    when mnps form dense assemblies , interparticle interactions produce a collective behavior , by coupling the magnetic moments of individual mnps",
    "this fact renders in most cases even the determination of the ground state configuration an intricate physical problem .",
    "the collective behavior of dense ( interacting ) assemblies is reflected also on the modified magnetic response of the assembly , compared to isolated mnps .",
    "the most complex behavior occurs in samples with random morphology and long - range magnetostatic interactions .",
    "various experimental measurements have been proposed to reveal the nature of the interparticle interactions , and various measuring protocols probe different aspects of the collective behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "analytical models have difficulties in predicting or explaining the magnetic behavior of these interacting mnp assemblies , and most of the curret research relies on numerical simulations .    in this chapter",
    "we provide an introduction to the fundamental ideas and concepts pertaining to the magnetic properties of mnp assemblies .",
    "emphasis is given to the response of mnp assemblies to an applied magnetic field and the related issue of magnetization reversal .",
    "the chapter is organized as follows : in section [ sec_back ] we discuss the magnetic properties of individual ( isolated ) mnps .",
    "fist , the condition under which a single - domain mnp is formed is derived , and then the magnetic response under an applied field is examined .",
    "the presentation is based on a simple theoretical model ( nel 1949 , stoner 1948 ) . in section [ sec_exp_methods ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the most common magnetic characterization techniques and explain the information extracted from each one . in section [ sec_state ]",
    "we discuss the response of a dense mnp assembly to a magnetic field , when the interparticle interactions are important and lead to a collective behavior of the mnps .",
    "mean - field models are presented and an introduction to modern numerical techniques ( monte carlo , magnetization dynamics ) to tackle this problem are presented .",
    "the chapter is summarized in section [ sec_sum ] and the perspectives in this field are presented in sections [ sec_persp ] .",
    "in this section we derive the criterion for formation of single - domain mnps and examine the magnetization process at zero temperature by coherent rotation of magnetization ( stoner - wohlfarth model ) .",
    "the behavior of a mnp assembly at finite temperature is discussed and the related concepts of superparamagnetism and blocking temperature are introduced .",
    "the effects of an applied dc magnetic field is examined within the simplest model assuming uniaxial anisotropy and bistability of particle moments ( nel model ) .",
    "the ground state magnetic structure of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) material is the outcome of the balance between three different types of energies , namely , the exchange ( @xmath3 ) , the magnetostatic ( @xmath4 ) and the anisotropy energy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the exchange interaction has its origin in the pauli exclusion principle for electrons .",
    "let the fm material be divided in small cubic elements each one carrying a magnetic moment @xmath6 .",
    "the exchange interaction between the cubic elements favors parallel alignment of neighboring magnetic moments and it is written in the usual heisenberg form as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the stiffness constant , @xmath9 is the lattice constant and @xmath10 is the angle between moments at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". the stiffness constant is related to the microscopic exchange energy @xmath13 through the relation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the atomic spin and @xmath16 for sc , fcc and bcc lattice , respectively .",
    "the magnetostatic energy , is the sum of coulomb energies between the magnetic moments comprising the fm material .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the _ demagnetizing _ field and @xmath19 the sample magnetization .",
    "the anisotropy energy , is the energy required to orient the magnetization at an angle ( @xmath20 ) relative to certain fixed axes of the system , known as the _ easy _ axes .",
    "the microscopic mechanisms leading to anisotropy can be quite diverse and the most common types of anisotropy found in fms are as follows :    \\(i ) _ crystal _ anisotropy .",
    "it arises from the combined effects of spin - orbit coupling and quenching of the orbital momentum that produce a preferred orientation of the magnetization along a symmetry axes of the underlying crystal . for a uniaxial materials ( e.g. hexagonal co )",
    "it has the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the anisotropy constants , and @xmath20 the angle between the magnetization direction and the easy axis .",
    "typical values for cobalt are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for cubic crystals ( e.g. fcc fe , ni )",
    "it reads @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the direction cosines of the magnetization direction .",
    "typical values for fe are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ stress _ anisotropy .",
    "it is produced by the presence of stress in the sample and it has a uniaxial character @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the magnetically induced isotropic strain and @xmath32 the stress .",
    "\\(iii ) _ surface _ anisotropy .",
    "this is caused by the presence of sample free boundaries , where the reduced symmetry and the presence of defects can induce additional anisotropy .",
    "it is important in mnps because of the substantial surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "\\(iv ) _ shape _ anisotropy .",
    "this occurs because on one hand the demagnetizing field depends on the shape of the magnetized body and takes the lowest value along the longest axis of the sample , and on the other hand , @xmath4 is minimized when @xmath19 is parallel to @xmath18 . as an example , consider a specimen in the shape of prolate spheroid with major axis @xmath33 and minor axis @xmath9 , magnetized at an angle @xmath20 with respect to @xmath33-axis .",
    "then , @xmath34 = \\frac{1}{2}(n_c - n_a)m^2\\sin^2\\theta   $ ] , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the _ demagnetizing _ factors along the corresponding axes .",
    "this expression for @xmath4 has the form of uniaxial anisotropy with @xmath37 .",
    "typical cases , are a spherical specimen with @xmath38 , an infinitely thin planar specimen with @xmath39 ( in - plane ) and @xmath40 , and a infinitely long ( needle - shaped ) specimen with @xmath41 ( along the axis ) and @xmath42 .    in studies of the magnetic properties of mnps ,",
    "it is a common practice , to describe , within the simplest approximation , the overall effect of the various anisotropy types by an _",
    "effective _ uniaxial anisotropy term @xmath43 . the constant @xmath44 accounts for the total effect of crystalline , surface and shape anisotropy .",
    "a bulk fm material is composed of many uniformly magnetized regions ( _ domains _ ) .",
    "the direction of magnetization in different domains varies , and in a bulk sample it is randomly distributed leading to a non - magnetized sample even at temperatures far below the curie point . the formation of magnetic domains in fm materials results from the competition between the exchange and the magnetostatic energy .",
    "the former favors perfect alignment of neighboring moments and the latter is reduced by breaking a uniformly magnetized body into as many as possible regions with opposite magnetization directions .",
    "the outcome of this competition is the formation of a certain number of domains in a sample with a particular orientation of the magnetization directions .",
    "a typical domain size in a bulk ferromagnet is @xmath45 .",
    "neighboring magnetic domains are separated by a region where the local magnetization changes gradually direction between the two opposite sides , known as _ domain wall _ ( dw ) .",
    "domain walls have finite width @xmath46 determined by the balance between the exchange and anisotropy energy . as an example , consider an one - dimensional model of a dw in a uniaxial material , where a @xmath47 rotation of magnetization is distributed over n sites , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dw ] .",
    "domain wall spread over @xmath48 sites .",
    "the gradual rotation of atomic moments produces a state with lower total energy compared to ( b ) . ]",
    "the total energy per unit area reads @xmath49 minimization with respect to @xmath50 leads to @xmath51 for a typical exchange stiffness value ( @xmath52 ) , eq.([eq_ddw ] ) predicts for iron @xmath53 while for a magnetically harder material like cobalt , @xmath54 . substituting the result of eq.([eq_ddw ] ) into in eq.([eq_sn ] ) provides the areal energy density of the dw @xmath55    consider a finite sample of a fm material , with size @xmath56 . as the size of the sample",
    "is reduced , the number of dws it contains decreases , because fewer regions with opposite directions of magnetization are required to reduce the magnetostatic energy . below a critical value of the system size",
    ", the sample does not contain any dw and it is in a _ single domain _ ( sd ) state exhibiting saturation magnetization @xmath57 . for a spherical particle",
    ", the critical diameter @xmath58 can be estimated as follows : the sd state is stable when the energy needed to create a dw that spans the whole particle , @xmath59 , is greater than the magnetostatic energy gain from the reduction to a multidomain state , which is approximately equal to the magnetostatic energy stored in a uniformly magnetized sphere , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the saturation magnetization and @xmath62 .",
    "the condition @xmath63 provides @xmath64 for fe , this approximation gives @xmath65 , which is by far too small .",
    "the reason is that the dw is assumed to have the same one - dimensional structure as in the bulk material .",
    "an improved calculation that considers a three - dimensional confinement of the dw provides for the critical radius : @xmath66   } \\label{eq_rcr2}\\ ] ] in the case of fe , numerical solution of eq.([eq_rcr2 ] ) gives @xmath67 , which is very close to more accurate micromagnetic calculations and the experimentally obtained value ( cullity 1972 ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath68 of a bulk fm crystal that contains many magnetic domains , changes under application of an external magnetic field @xmath69 , a process known as _",
    "technical magnetization_. however , the value of @xmath19 is not a unique function of @xmath70 and the state of the sample _ prior _ to application of the field is important .",
    "this is the phenomenon of magnetic _ hysteresis _ , which is commonly depicted by drawing the @xmath71 dependence under a cyclic variation of the field from a positive to a negative and back to a positive saturation value ( _ hysteresis loop _ ) .",
    "two important characteristic values of a hysteresis loop are the _ remanence _ ( @xmath72 ) , namely the magnetization after removal of the saturating field , and the _ coercivity _ ( @xmath73 ) , namely the field required for the magnetization to vanish . in a bulk fm crystal , the magnetization proceeds by two basic mechanisms , namely domain wall motion ( weak fields ) and rotation of magnetization ( strong fields ) .    in mnps",
    ", the change of magnetization under an applied field proceeds only by rotation , because formation of dws is energetically unfavorable . during the magnetization rotation",
    "the atomic moments of the mnp remain parallel to each other and the mnp behaves as a giant molecule carrying a magnetic moment of a few thousand bohr magnetons ( @xmath74 for a @xmath75 diameter fe mnp ) .",
    "this process of magnetization is known as _",
    "coherent _ rotation or _ stoner - wohlfarth _",

    "( b ) magnetization curves within the stoner - wohlfarth model for various field directions .",
    "the initial direction of the magnetization is taken along the field . ]",
    "the remanence ( @xmath88 ) and coercivity ( @xmath89 ) are readily obtained from eq.([eq_sw_mh ] ) as @xmath90 for non - zero field values , eq.([eq_sw_mh ] ) is solved for @xmath91 as a function of @xmath92 and the data are shown in fig .  [ fig_sw_mh ] .",
    "consider the two extreme cases , namely for @xmath93 ( hard - axis magnetization ) and @xmath94 ( easy - axis magnetization ) . in the former case ,",
    "the magnetization shows zero coercivity and a linear field dependence . in the latter case ,",
    "the magnetization remains constant until the reversing field becomes equal to the anisotropy field , and then an _",
    "irreversible _ jump of the reduced magnetization from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is seen .",
    "these extreme cases demonstrate the distinct mechanism of switching by rotation that can occur in an assembly .",
    "more generally , at an arbitrary field angle , an irreversible jump of the magnetization occurs at the so called _ switching _ field ( @xmath97 ) defined as the field value satisfying @xmath98 . at @xmath99",
    "the local minimum of the total energy , corresponding to the higher energy state ( magnetization opposite to the applied field ) disappears and the system jumps to the remaining minimum that corresponds to a magnetization direction along the field ( see fig .  [ fig_sw - e(theta ) ] ) . in other words , @xmath97 is an instability point of the total energy and it satisfies @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in the sw model , the stability condition reads @xmath102 from eqs.([eq_equil2 ] ) and ( [ eq_stab ] ) we obtain for the switching field @xmath103 @xmath104 by comparison of eqs.([eq_sw_mrhc ] ) and ( [ eq_sw_hs ] ) one finds that @xmath105 for @xmath106 , namely switching happens after the magnetization changes sign , while for field angles close to the easy axis , @xmath107 , the magnetization changes sign by an irreversible jump ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the physical distinction between @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be understood by the following example . consider a sw particle under application of a reversing field @xmath111 , which brings the particle s moment @xmath80 in a direction perpendicular to the field , so that @xmath89",
    ". then the field is switched off adiabatically .",

    ", the information bit is stored in the direction of magnetization and the switching field is the field required to write or erase this information .",
    "stoner and wohlfarth ( stoner 1948 ) also studied an assembly of isolated mnps with easy axes directions distributed uniformly on a sphere ( _ random anisotropy model _ , rim ) .",
    "the reported values for the remanence and coercivity are @xmath118 this result is particularly useful as random easy axis distribution is found in most mnp - based materials ( granular films , cluster - assembled films , self - assembled arrays , etc )    as a final remark , we remind that in the sw model thermal effects are ignored @xmath119 , thus energy - minimization with respect to the magnetic moment direction is a sufficient condition to determine the field - dependent magnetization at equilibrium . the magnetic behavior of sd particles at finite temperature",
    "is discussed in the following section .",
    "how do thermal fluctuations affect the average magnetization direction of an isolated mnp  ?",
    "how does the presence of an applied field modify the magnetic response at finite temperature  ?",
    "is the assembly magnetization stable in time , when the mnp moment are subject to thermal fluctuations  ?",
    "these points are briefly discussed next , along the lines of a model first studied by nel ( nel 1949 ) .",
    "consider an assembly of identical sd particles with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the energy ( per particle ) is @xmath120 , where @xmath20 is the angle between the single particle magnetic moment @xmath80 and the easy axis .",
    "the energy barrier that must be overcome for a mnp to rotate its magnetization is @xmath121 . as first pointed out by nel ( nel 1949 ) , thermal fluctuations could provide the required energy to overcome the anisotropy barrier and spontaneously ( i.e. without externally applied field ) reverse the magnetization of a mnp from one easy direction to the other .",
    "this phenomenon can be thought of as a brownian motion of a particle s magnetic moment .",
    "the assembly shows paramagnetic behavior , however it is the giant moments of the mnps that fluctuate rather than the atomic moments of a classical bulk paramagnetic material .",
    "this magnetic behavior of the mnps is called _ superparamagnetism _ ( spm ) ( bean 1959 ) at high enough temperature , @xmath122 , the anisotropy energy can be neglected and the assembly magnetization can be described by the well known langevin function @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the particle number density , and @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the features serving as signature of superparamagnetism are the scaling of magnetization curves with @xmath126 , as dictated by the langevin function , and the lack of hysteresis , i.e. vanishing remanence and coercivity .",
    "moreover , the major difference between classical paramagnetism of bulk materials and spm is the weak fields @xmath127 required to achieve saturation of a mnp assembly magnetization @xmath19 .",
    "this occurs because of the large particle moment @xmath128 compared to the atomic moments @xmath129 .",
    "measurement of magnetization curves at sufficiently high temperature can , in principle , be used to extract the particle moment @xmath130 . in practice ,",
    "two complication arise .",
    "first , the presence of different particle sizes in any sample produces a convolution of the langevin function with the volume distribution function .",
    "second , interparticle interactions , modify the reversal mechanism and the sw model needs extensions , which are discussed in the section  [ sec_state ] .",
    "at low temperature , @xmath131 , the anisotropy barriers are very rarely overcome ( weak thermal fluctuations ) , the assembly shows hysteresis and this is called the _ blocked _ state .",
    "one might now ask , whether there exists a temperature value that draws the border between the blocked and the spm state . following nel s arguments",
    ", we assume that thermal activation over the anisotropy barrier can be described within the _ relaxation time _ approximation ( or _ arrhenius law _ ) as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the probability per unit time for a reversal of @xmath80 .",
    "the intrinsic time @xmath134 depends on the material parameters ( magnetostriction constant , young modulus , anisotropy constant and saturation magnetization ) .",
    "typical values are @xmath135 as obtained by nel . to detect the superparamagnetic behavior",
    "experimentally , the mnp must be probed for a long enough period of time to perform many switching events that would produce a vanishing small time - average magnetic moment .",
    "if @xmath136 is the measuring time - window , the condition for spm behavior is @xmath137 .",
    "the strong ( exponential ) dependence of @xmath138 on temperature ( see eq.([eq_tau ] ) ) permits us to define a temperature value ( or more precisely , a very narrow temperature range ) above which the relaxation time is so small that spm behavior is observed .",
    "this is called the _ blocking temperature _ ( @xmath139 ) of the assembly , and is given by @xmath140 for @xmath141 , the particle moments fluctuate without switching direction ( on average ) and the assembly is in the blocked state exhibiting hysteresis . for @xmath142",
    "the assembly is in the spm state , hysteresis disappears and thermal equilibrium is established .",
    "it is remarkable , that the value of @xmath139 depends on @xmath136 , which is a characteristic of the experimental technique adopted .",
    "for example , in dc susceptibility measurements @xmath143 , in ac susceptibility @xmath144 , in mssbauer spectroscopy @xmath145 and in neutron spectroscopy @xmath146 . therefore",
    ", if @xmath139 is of interest for a particular application , the measurement technique implemented must imitate the real conditions .",
    "for example , to study the reliability of magnetic storage media , dc magnetic measurements over a wide time window ( @xmath147 ) should be used , while to study magnetic recording speed , ac measurements are appropriate .",
    "brown ( brown 1963 ) extended the treatment of thermal activation over the anisotropy barrier , allowing also for fluctuations of @xmath130 transverse to the easy axis , which nel has neglected , and obtained a different expression for @xmath134 .",
    "however , the common feature of both studies is the temperature and volume dependence of @xmath138 , so the final result , eq.([eq_tau ] ) , is referred to as the _ nel - brown _ model .    in a _ polydisperse _",
    "assembly , the distribution of particle volumes @xmath148 , produces a corresponding distribution of blocking temperatures @xmath149 .",
    "then , at a certain temperature @xmath150 the assembly contains a mixture of blocked and spm particles .",
    "the mnps with volumes above a critical value @xmath151 , fulfill the requirement of strong thermal energy with respect to their anisotropy barrier , and are spm , while those while those with @xmath152 are blocked . from eq.([eq_tau ] ) , the critical volume reads @xmath153 .",
    "as explained above for @xmath139 , also for @xmath151 the experimental determination depends on the technique adopted .",
    "most preparation techniques result in polydisperse samples and the problem of extracting the size distribution function from magnetic measurements , pioneered by bean and jacobs more than fifty years ago ( bean 1956 ) remains a difficult task mainly due to the complications introduced by interparticle interactions .",

    "the blocking temperature , as measured within a time - window @xmath136 , is reached when the observation time equals the _ forward _ relaxation time @xmath167 , because the latter corresponds to a moment flip from the initial state along @xmath158 to the opposite direction , namely a process that reduces the initial magnetization . from eq.([eq_tau(h ) ] ) one obtains @xmath168 which indicates that the blocking temperature is reduced by the presence of a reverse field . by completely symmetric arguments one could show that @xmath139 increases in the presence of a field with the same direction as the initial magnetization .    since thermal fluctuations act in synergy to a reverse field in switching the moment of a mnp , it is expected that the coercivity of an assembly will decay with temperature . as discussed above , for a particle with its moment along the @xmath158-axis ,",
    "a reverse field @xmath169 reduces the barrier for reversal to the value @xmath170 given in eq.([eq_tau(h ) ] ) .",
    "if the field is strong enough , it will reduce the barrier to the value appropriate for superparamagnetic relaxation , namely @xmath171 , and the ( time - average ) magnetization will vanish . on the other hand ,",
    "the reverse field that makes the magnetization vanish is by definition the coercive field .",

    "the time - evolution of @xmath175 is governed by the _ rate equation _",
    "@xmath178 the magnetization per particle is given as @xmath179 , and solution of eq.([eq_rate_n+(h ) ] ) provides @xmath180 with @xmath181 being the reduced relaxation time and @xmath182 the time - asymptote and initial values of the particle magnetization , respectively .",
    "eq.([eq_m(t , h ) ] ) indicates that the magnetization decays exponentially towards the equilibrium value @xmath183 , reached as @xmath184 . in other words ,",
    "equilibrium is reached when the population of the energy minima is proportional to the corresponding relaxation times @xmath185 , as dictated by eq.([eq_rate_n+(h ) ] ) .",
    "when the applied field is strong enough @xmath186 to produce only one minimum , thermal equilibrium is always reached .",
    "obviously , in the absence of an external field , thermal equilibrium is reached when the two equivalent minima are equally populated @xmath187 , resulting in a vanishing magnetization .",
    "notice that in eq.([eq_rate_n+(h ) ] ) we assumed bistability of the moment direction , which is a valid approximation provided the anisotropy barrier is high @xmath188 . for lower anisotropy barriers or elevated temperature @xmath189 , the transverse fluctuations of @xmath80 , or , in other words , intra - valley motion around the energy minimum should be taken into account .",
    "a general treatment of thermal relaxation of sd mnps was pioneered by brown ( brown 1963 ) and extended to the case of an applied external field ( aharoni 1965 , coffey 1998 , garannin 1999 ) .",
    "if an assembly is polydisperse , characterized by a volume distribution @xmath148 , a distribution of blocking temperatures @xmath149 exists .",
    "however , it remains still unclear if the mean value @xmath190 is the appropriate blocking temperature of the assembly , which should be substituted , for example , in eq.([eq_sw_hc(t ) ] ) .",
    "this point is discussed further in the literature ( nunes _ et al _ 2004 ) .    in a polydisperse assembly , a distribution of relaxation times @xmath191 exists , with @xmath192 the probability of a mnp to have @xmath193 in the range @xmath194 and the normalization condition @xmath195 . in this case",
    "the magnetization can be obtained by a superposition of the single - particle magnetization properly weighted , as follows @xmath196                             \\frac{f(\\tau)}{\\tau } d\\tau,\\ ] ] where the term in brackets is the probability per unit time for a particle not to flip its moment . for a broad enough distribution ,",
    "the observation time @xmath174 will satisfy @xmath197 , where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the minimum and maximum relaxation times of the assembly , respectively . assuming a uniform distribution @xmath191 , it can be shown that the magnetization exhibits a logarithmic relaxation @xmath200 with @xmath15 the _ magnetic viscosity _ of the system .",
    "thus , polydispersity produces a much slower decay of magnetization with time .",
    "the discussion so far , refers to a field applied parallel to the easy axis .",
    "however , random anisotropy is most commonly found in mnp assemblies and the the necessity to study the effect of a tilted field with respect to the easy axis , arises . in this case , the calculation of the energy barriers and relaxation time is a much more complicated task and no analytical solution exists .",
    "numerical studies ( pfeiffer 1990 ) showed that the energy barrier for an applied field at an angle @xmath78 to the easy axis can be approximately written as @xmath201 where @xmath109 is given by eq.([eq_sw_hs ] ) . in the limit of @xmath202 , eq.([eq_pfeif_eb ] ) reduces to eq.([eq_tau(h ) ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the coercivity for a monodisperse assembly with random anisotropy has also been obtained numerically ( pfeiffer 1990 ) as @xmath203 , \\label{eq_ram_hc(t)}\\ ] ] which at @xmath204 reduces to the sw result of eq.([eq_ram ] ) .",
    "a detailed theoretical study of the relaxation time for a non - uniaxial applied field can be found in the review by coffey and colleagues ( coffey 1993 ) .    as a concluding remark , the presence of polydispersity and random anisotropy makes the description of the magnetic behavior of an assembly intractable to exact analytical treatment .",
    "instead , numerical approximations and simulation methods provide the alternative theoretical tools to study these systems .",
    "numerical simulation approaches are introduced in section [ sec_state ] .",
    "thermal relaxation has a dynamic character , therefore , the relation between the various relaxation times of the assembly and the measurement time is a decisive parameter for the outcome of a measurement .",
    "additionally , if the assembly is not at equilibrium during the measurement , or if it changes its equilibrium state ( for example , by adiabatic changes of the applied field ) the result of the measurements depends on the measurement protocol followed . in what follows",
    "we discuss two very common types of static measurements , that reveal the temperature and field dependence of the magnetization and provide evidence for superparamagnetic relaxation .",
    "dynamic measurements are not discussed in this article .",
    "the interested reader can find more on the physical principles behind the most common magnetic measurement techniques in the review of dormann and colleagues ( dormann 1997 ) .",
    "this is a measurement protocol adopted for investigation of the temperature dependent magnetization of an assembly and it reveals superparamagnetic behavior .",
    "it is performed in three stages . in the first , the sample is initially at a high enough temperature ( @xmath205 ) to ensure a spm state and it is cooled to low temperature ( @xmath206 ) to approach its ground state . in the second stage , a weak field is applied ( @xmath207 ) , the sample is heated up to @xmath205 and the magnetization is measured as a function of temperature .",
    "this is the zfc curve . in the third stage ,",
    "the system is cooled down to @xmath206 , without removing the field , while the magnetization is recorded again , producing the fc curve . during cooling and heating the temperature changes at the same constant rate .",
    "a typical zfc - fc curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_zfc ] .    .",
    "arrows indicate the direction the measurements are taken . for @xmath142",
    "the system is in thermal equilibrium and the heating process is reversible .",
    "( b ) fc - zfc curves for a dilute ( non - interacting ) assembly of fe nanoparticles ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) .",
    "the blocking temperature ( dotted line ) decreases weakly with increasing measuring field .",
    "the non - zero values of @xmath210 are due to the finite value of the measuring field .",
    "data produced by monte carlo simulations ( section [ ssec_mcmd ] ) ]    as the temperature rises , the blocked magnetic moments align easier along the applied field leading to an initial increase of the zfc curve .",
    "however , as soon as thermal fluctuations push the moments over the anisotropy barrier , thermal randomization of the moments produces a drop of the curve . therefore , the peak of zfc curve corresponds to the blocking temperature of the assembly .",
    "notice that above @xmath139 the zfc and fc curves coincide , because the system is in thermal equilibrium and the the heating ( cooling ) process is reversible .",
    "on cooling below @xmath139 the moments remain partially aligned along the field , and the magnetization tends to a non - zero value .",
    "the magnetization vanishes at the ground state ( @xmath206 ) if the measuring field is very weak , a random distribution of the easy axes exists and the assembly is non - interacting ( dilute ) .",
    "deviations from any of the above conditions produce a non - zero value for @xmath210 . for isolated mnps ,",
    "the zfc - fc curves are only weakly sensitive to the value of the applied field , provided that it is weak @xmath211 .",
    "remanent magnetization at a certain field , @xmath212 , is measured after switching off the previously applied field @xmath70 . in an assembly of mnps , remanence arises because the moments of some particles , which have rotated under an applied field and to do so they have overcome an energy barrier , can not rotate back to their original direction after removal of the field . in a polydisperse assembly , at finite temperature @xmath150 , only the blocked mnps , namely those with @xmath213 contribute to the remanence .",
    "therefore , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the critical barrier for spm relaxation at temperature @xmath150 . taking into account that @xmath216 ( see eq.([eq_tb ] ) ) , we deduce that @xmath217 namely , the slope of @xmath218 provides the barrier ( or blocking temperature ) distribution function of the assembly .",
    "there are three different measurement protocols for the remanent magnetization , as first suggested by wohlfarth ( wohlfarth 1958 ) :    \\(i ) _ thermoremanence _",

    "\\(ii ) _ isothermal remanence _ @xmath220 , measured at the end of zfc process from @xmath205 down to the measuring temperature @xmath150 , at which a field @xmath70 is applied and then removed .",
    "\\(iii ) _ dc demagnetization remanence _ @xmath221 . first",
    ", a zfc process from @xmath205 down to the measuring temperature @xmath150 is performed .",
    "second , the sample is brought to _ saturation _ remanence @xmath222 .",
    "third , a _ reverse _",
    "field @xmath70 is applied and then removed to leave the sample at the @xmath221 remanence .",
    "wohlfarth pointed out that for isolated mnps the different remanent magnetizations are related as @xmath223 .",
    "more interestingly , the deviations from this equality , defined as @xmath224 \\label{eq_henkel}\\ ] ] quantify the character and strength of interparticle interactions and are obtained experimentally ( ogrady _ et al _ 1993 ) .",
    "positive @xmath225 values imply interactions with magnetizing character , and negative values indicate demagnetizing interactions .",
    "we should say that this is only a phenomenological characterization of the interactions , because eq.([eq_henkel ] ) does not provide any information about their microscopic origin .",
    "however , eq.([eq_henkel ] ) has been proved a standard tool for quantification of interparticle interactions in complex mnp assemblies such as those used in modern industry of magnetic recording media ( granular films , particulate media ) .",
    "interparticle interactions are discussed in the section  [ sec_state ] .",
    "the magnetic interactions that are present in bulk magnetic materials pertain to mnp assemblies and they preserve their physical origin and characteristics",
    ". in particular , ( direct ) exchange between atomic moments separated by a few lattice constants can couple ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically two mnps via their surface atoms .",
    "indirect exchange or ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction exists between mnps hosted in a metallic matrix , which provides free electrons required to mediate the interaction between the atomic moments of the mnps . finally",
    ", magnetostatic interactions , which are of minor importance in bulk magnets due to their weakness , become the dominant interactions in mnp assemblies with _",
    "well separated _ mnps .",
    "this situation occurs for two reasons .",
    "first , the exchange interactions have a very short range ( up to @xmath226 ) , the rkky interactions have an oscillating fm / afm character with a period of a few  , which renders to zero their average effect on the mnp volume , so both have a weak effect in interparticle coupling . on the other hand , magnetostatic interactions , in the lowest approximation , namely the dipolar contribution , are proportional to the magnitude of the coupled magnetic moments , which for sd particles has an enormously large value compared to the atomic moments ( @xmath227 ) .    further on we discuss the effects of magnetostatic ( dipolar ) interactions on the magnetic properties of mnp assemblies and their interplay with single - particle anisotropy .",
    "the complexity of this problem arises from the _ long - range _",
    "( @xmath228 , @xmath56 being the interparticle distance ) and _ anisotropic _ character of the dipolar interactions , namely the dependence of interaction energy on the orientation of the moments relative to the bond joining the particle centers ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ddi ] ) .        understanding and",
    "controlling the effects of dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) in mnp assemblies is of paramount importance to modern technology of magnetic recording media for two opposite reasons .",
    "first , ddi couple the mnps of an assembly .",
    "the ultimate goal in magnetic recording applications is to address each mnp individually and treat it as a magnetic bit . in this case , ddi have a parasitic role and one wishes to estimate and reduce their impact in the magnetic properties of an assembly . on the contrary , magnetic logic devices , have been proposed and built that exploit the magnetostatic coupling between ordered mnp arrays ( linear or planar ) to transfer a magnetic bit ( usually a flipped moment ) between two distant points in the array ( cowburn 2006 ) . in this case ,",
    "ddi are of central importance and the goal is to enhance and tailor their effects .    over the last two decades , many research groups have prepared and measured mnp assemblies in various forms ( granular films , ferrofluids , cluster assembled films , self - assembled nanoparticles , lithographic arrays of magnetic dots ) and studied the intrinsic factors ( host and particle material , particle size , particle density ) and the extrinsic factors ( temperature , field , measurement protocol ) that control the magnetic behavior .",
    "in many of these studies the presence of magnetostatic interactions has been confirmed . among the above mentioned systems",
    ", the self - assembled mnps prepared by a synthetic route offer the advantage of containing well separated mnps with a very narrow size distribution ( @xmath229 ) , so they are ideal systems to study ddi effects . experimental observations on self - assembled mnps that have been attributed to ddi include , reduction of the remanence at low temperature ( held 2001 ) , increase of the blocking temperature ( murray 2001 ) , increase of the barrier distribution width ( woods 2001 ) , deviations of the zero - field cooled magnetization curves from the curie behavior ( puntes 2001 ) , and difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane remanence ( russier 2000 ) .",
    "long - range ferromagnetic order in linear chains ( russier 2003 ) , and hexagonal arrays ( puntes 2004 , yamamoto 2008 ) of dipolar coupled single - domain magnetic nanoparticles has been demonstrated , supporting the existence of a _",
    "dipolar superferromagnetic _ ground state , characterized by ferromagnetic long - range order of the particle moments .",
    "investigations of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of dipolar interacting nanoparticle assemblies brought up fundamental issues related to the existence of a ground state which shares common features with _",
    "spin glasses _ , such as slow relaxation , memory and ageing effects ( sasaki 2005 ) .",
    "the latter are magnetic systems characterized by disorder and competing interactions that produce an energy landscape with many local minima , considered responsible for the occurrence of these effects .",
    "dipolar interparticle interactions in dense and random nanoparticle assemblies are believed to cause a _ spin - glass - like _ behavior ( dormann 1997 ) .",
    "theoretical models have been developed in an effort to explain these observations and related previous ones in assemblies with randomly located mnps ( granular films , cluster - assembled films ) . on a microscopic level , the presence of ddi between mnps modifies the magnetization switching mechanism , which for an isolated mnp obeys the nel - arrhenius model .",
    "when anisotropic mnps are dipolar coupled , the reversal mechanism is determined by the interplay between the single - particle anisotropy energy ( @xmath230 ) and the dipolar interaction energy ( @xmath231 ) . for weak interactions ( @xmath232 ) ,",
    "the moments reverse _ independently _ by thermal activation over energy barriers , which are however modified due to ddi .",
    "this limiting case is treated within a mean - field approximation and is discussed in section  [ ssec_mft ] . for strong interactions ( @xmath233 ) , the single - particle reversal is no longer valid .",
    "reversal of one particle can excite the reversal of others , and the assembly behaves in a collective manner .",
    "many - body energy barriers exist in the system , with values that depend on the configuration of all moments .",
    "their evaluation becomes a formidable task and numerical simulations offer in this case an indispensable tool .",
    "numerical methods are briefly discussed in section [ ssec_mcmd ] .    for a detailed review on the magnetic properties of dipolar interacting mnp assemblies the reader",

    "eq.([eq_vogel ] ) , also known as the _ vogel - fulcher law _ , indicates that the relaxation time of an assembly of interacting mnps is the same as that of the isolated mnps at a _ lower _ temperature .    in the shtrikman - wohlfarth model ,",
    "the temperature @xmath240 , or equivalently the thermal average @xmath241 , is not related to the microscopic parameters of the assembly , i.e. particle location , and is treated as a phenomenological parameter , fitted to experimental data .",
    "dormann and colleagues ( dormann 1988 , dormann 1997 ) developed a statistical model for the average barrier in a dipolar interacting assembly which quantifies the interaction field and provides for the single - particle energy barrier @xmath242 with @xmath243 the number of nearest neighbors of a particle , @xmath244 , @xmath245 the volume concentration of the particles and @xmath246 the langevin function .",
    "eq.([eq_dfb_model ] ) indicates that the anisotropy barrier is increased due to ddi , thus the model of dormann _ et al _ predicts an increase of the blocking temperature due to ddi .",
    "this model behavior has been observed in almost all types of mnp assemblies , with a few exceptions ( hansen and mrup 1998 ) .",
    "more recently , allia _ et al _ ( allia 2001 ) used also a phenomenological approach to describe a superparamagnetic assembly with weak ddi .",
    "namely , an assembly in a regime that the remanence and coercivity vanish , but the field - dependent magnetization varies with concentration of mnps indicating the presence of ddi . the authors ( allia 2001 ) suggested that the dipolar field changes at a high rate and in random direction and therefore acts similar to the thermal field .",
    "the effect is accounted for by an apparent increase of the system temperature .",
    "the magnetization at temperature @xmath150 is given by @xmath247 $ ] , with @xmath248 related to the average dipolar energy via @xmath249 and obtained by a fitting procedure .",
    "this model interpreted successfully the magnetization behavior of co nanoparticles in cu matrix and established the existence of the interacting superparamagnet regime ( allia 2001 ) .",
    "the mean - field models have the advantage of providing analytical expressions suitable for extracting system parameters from the experimental data by a fitting process .",
    "however , they are not applicable to strongly dipolar systems and they do not account for collective effects .",
    "numerical techniques on the other hand , have the major advantage that they treat rigorously the local and temporal statistical fluctuations of the macroscopic quantities characterizing the mnp assembly and provide an efficient interpolation scheme between the weak and the strong interaction regimes .",
    "we discuss briefly two most common numerical approaches , the monte carlo ( mc ) method and the magnetization dynamics ( md ) method .",
    "different algorithms that mimic thermal fluctuations of the degrees of freedom of a physical system by means of ( pseudo)random numbers go under the umbrella of monte carlo techniques . in the case of mnps , two",
    "widely used algorithms are the metropolis monte carlo ( mmc ) and the kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) .",
    "the former is appropriate for a description of the equilibrium behavior of an assembly , while the latter also accounts , within a certain time scale , for the transition to equilibrium .",
    "both algorithms provide thermal averages of macroscopic quantities of interest in the canonical ensemble , i.e. at constant temperature . to do so a sampling of the phase space is performed ,",
    "however the sampling procedures differ , as outlined below .",
    "the mmc algorithm samples the phase space , visiting preferentially states close to the equilibrium states ( _ importance sampling _ ) .",
    "this is achieved when subsequently visited states form a markov chain , meaning that the probability of visiting the next state depends only on the last visited one .",
    "to do so , one chooses the transition from state @xmath250 to @xmath251 to occur with certainty , if it reduces the total energy ( @xmath252 ) and with a finite probability @xmath253 , if it increases the total energy ( @xmath254 ) .",
    "thus the system is allowed to climb - up energy barriers and slide - down toward energy minima until it reaches eventually the global minimum .    in kmc",
    "the system jumps from a state @xmath250 at a local minimum to a new state @xmath251 being also a local minimum by overcoming a barrier @xmath255 .",
    "the jump is performed within a predefined time step @xmath256 with probability @xmath257 where @xmath138 is the corresponding relaxation time with arrhenius behavior , @xmath258 .    in both algorithms ,",
    "interparticle interactions are included by replacing the applied field @xmath70 with the _ total _ field @xmath259 , which includes the contribution from the _ interaction _ field @xmath260 .",
    "in contrast to mean - field theories , in mc and md ( see next section ) techniques the interaction field is treated exactly , meaning that its value depends on the configuration of all the moments of the assembly and it changes at each time - step .",
    "an important distinction between the mc algorithms is that kmc simulates the relaxation of the system in physical time , while time quantification of the mmc time step is possible only in the absence of interparticle interactions ( nowak 2000 , chubykalo 2003 ) .",
    "however , a serious difficulty in kmc arises from the calculation of the local energy barrier required to obtain the transition probability . in an interacting system",
    "the barrier depends on _ all _ degrees of freedom and its calculation is a formidable task ( chubykalo 2004 , jensen 2006 ) , usually performed in an approximate manner ( pfeiffer 1990 , chantrell 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the kmc assumes that the system evolves through thermally activated jumps over energy barriers , an approximation that becomes invalid at elevated temperatures @xmath261 , or when collective behavior becomes important , as , for example , in strongly interacting mnps .",
    "collective effects are better described within the mmc algorithm .    for a detailed description and technical implementation of mc algorithms",
    "the interested reader could refer to the book by landau and binder ( landau 2000 )      in this method , the equations of motion for the magnetic moments are integrated in time and time averages of the macroscopic magnetization are recorded . at zero temperature ,",
    "the time - evolution of a magnetic moment @xmath262 under a total field @xmath263 is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xmath264 with @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath268 a dimensionless damping parameter . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq_llg ] ) is the torque term leading to precession around the field axis and the second one is a phenomenological damping torque that tends to align the precessing moment with the field @xmath263 .",
    "the dynamics at finite temperature are described by introduction of an additional field ( @xmath269 ) term in eq.([eq_llg ] ) with stochastic character .",
    "@xmath270 is assumed to have zero time - average ( _ white noise _ ) and its values at different sites @xmath271 or different instants @xmath272 are uncorrelated . the llg equation augmented by the thermal field term",
    "is commonly referred to as the _ langevin _ or _ stochastic llg _ equation .",
    "the mc and md techniques are complementary since they describe thermal relaxation of magnetic properties in different time scales .",
    "in the md method , the characteristic time is a fraction ( @xmath273 ) of the precessional ( larmor ) period @xmath274 , which implies that simulation times up to @xmath275 are presently attainable .",
    "thus , md is the appropriate scheme to investigate fast - relaxation phenomena as , for example , the reversal path of magnetization under an applied short field pulse ( berkov 2002 , suess 2002 ) .    in kmc",

    "notice also that @xmath293 assumes a positive value that increases with @xmath56 values .",
    "this feature arises from the gradual formation of a long range ferromagnetic ground state , due to ddi .",
    "more examples of mc or md simulations and comparison to experiments on mnp assemblies can be found in the relevant literature ( vedmedenko 2007 , kechrakos and trohidou 2008 ) .",
    "we have discussed the main theoretical concepts that pertain to the magnetization properties of isolated ( non - interacting ) nanoparticles and their assemblies .",
    "we estimated the critical radius for formation of single domain particles and studied the zero - temperature magnetization reversal mechanism of coherent rotation ( stoner - wohlfarth model ) , the thermally activated reversal ( nel - brown model ) and the related phenomenon of superparamagnetism occurring above the blocking temperature .",
    "complications arising from size polydispersity , distribution of easy axes directions , and applied field on the relaxation time for magnetization reversal were discussed .",
    "two standard experimental techniques for ( static ) magnetic measurements , namely the field and temperature dependence of magnetization were outlined .",
    "finally , the subject of interparticle dipolar interactions was introduced along with the most common theoretical techniques used to analyze interacting systems .",
    "examples from monte carlo studies of mnp assemblies were given .",
    "the dynamic behavior of mnps in the presence of interparticle interactions is expected to remain a topic of intense scientific and technological research in the coming years .",
    "the research effort is expected to focus on both the atomic scale properties of individual magnetic nanoparticles and on the mesoscopic properties of nanoparticle assemblies .    on the _ atomic _ scale",
    ", future goals will include  : ( i ) reduction of the magnetic particle size without violating thermal stability ( _ superparamagnetic limit _ ) at room temperature .",
    "the technological benefit from progress in this direction will be the development of magnetic data - storage media with higher areal density .",
    "given that the spm effect is not observed below a certain size of a mnp , due to disorder effects on the particle surface , the search for new high - anisotropy materials is required .",
    "composite nanoparticles with a core - shell morphology ( skumryev 2003 ) constitute an interesting perspective .",
    "+ ( ii ) understanding and control of surface effects . with reduction of particle size the contribution from surface moments become of increasing importance .",
    "the chemical structure of the surface ( disorder , defects ) controls the magnitude and type of the surface anisotropy , which is usually much ( up to @xmath294 times ) larger than the core anisotropy .",
    "synthetic methods can offer indispensable routes to surface structure modification . _",
    "ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations are a valuable tool to predict the surface anisotropy values and modeling of mnps as multi - spin system will reveal complex magnetization reversal mechanisms beyond the stoner - wohlfarth model ( kachkachi 2000 ) .",
    "experiments on individual nanoparticles ( wernsdorfer 2000 ) offer a unique test of the above theories .",
    "the future task on the _ mesoscopic _ scale will be to understand and control collective magnetic behavior in ordered nanostructures ( self - assembled mnps and magnetic patterned media ) . ordered nanostructures include chemically prepared self - assembled mnps and lithographically prepared magnetic patterned media .",
    "chemical synthesis of mnps and self - assembly ( bottom - up approach ) is a very promising and cost - effective method to produce ordered mnp arrays ( willard 2004 ) .",
    "however , deeper understanding and improvement of the self - assembly process is required in order to achieve larger ( beyond @xmath295 ) sample area with structural coherence .",
    "there is still a remaining problem as nanoparticles self - assemble into hexagonal arrays that are incompatible with the square arrangements required in industrial applications . a resolution to this problem",
    "could be the recently demonstrated templated assembly ( cheng 2004 ) .",
    "lithographic patterning ( top - down approach ) offers better control over the geometrical aspects of the assembly but can not yet produce nanostructures with size below @xmath296 ( martin 2003 ) .",
    "increase of lithographic resolution is demanded in order to achieve patterned media with smaller ( below @xmath297 ) characteristic size . on the measurements side ,",
    "improvement of existing techniques to probe mesoscopic magnetic order and excitations is demanded .",
    "recent examples are the observation of mesoscopic sale magnetic order in self - assembled co nanoparticles by an indirect method ( small - angle neutron scattering)(sachan 2008 ) and by direct methods such as magnetic force microscopy ( puntes 2004 ) and electron holography ( yamamoto 2008 ) . from the point of view of basic physics ,",
    "ordered nanostructures constitute model systems to study collective magnetic behavior driven by magnetostatic interactions , because the size , the shape and the spatial arrangement of the magnetic nanostructures is well controlled .",
    "known phenomena are to be demonstrated on the mesoscopic scale and new ones possibly to be discovered . as a recent example , we refer to the observation of magnetic frustration is magnetostatically coupled magnetic microrods ( wang 2006 ) , a phenomenon previously met in bulk magnetic random alloys ( spin glasses ) .",
    "finally , progress in numerical modeling will provide methods for bridging the atomic scale and the mesoscopic scale simulations .",
    "such multi - scale simulations point to the future of theoretical investigations in the field of relaxation in magnetic nanoparticles and have only recently started to appear ( yanes 2007 , kazantseva 2008 ) .",
