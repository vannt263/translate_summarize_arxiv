    "as far as the new states of matter are obtained in laboratory using heavy ion collisions , it is mandatory to have as much as possible under control the finite size and dynamical aspects .",
    "one of these is the dynamical evolution of the transient piece of matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the present experimental evidence supports the existence of collective expansion caused by the pressure gradients built - up during the first phase of the collision .",
    "understanding this expansion one could aim to pin down the properties of the initial phase of matter , before expansion and at the same time , to extract information on in - medium effects , equation of state or phase transitions .",
    "results of a detailed analysis of the expansion properties of hot and compressed baryonic matter at sis energies in highly central and mid - central heavy ion collisions will be presented in chapters i and ii , respectively .",
    "chapter iii presents results of a similar analysis in terms of collective expansion and temperature at rhic energies , in the free baryonic sector .",
    "preliminary results seem to support the possibility to disentangle between the contributions coming from partonic and hadronic phases and to access information on the degree of thermal equilibration of these two stages of expanding matter formed in central collisions at 200 a@xmath0gev .",
    "conclusions will be presented in chapter iv .",
    "for the highly central au + au collision at 150 a@xmath0mev incident energy @xcite , the mean kinetic energy of fragments divided by their mass , was observed to present a dependence as a function of atomic charge which deviates from the one typical for a thermal plus coulomb scenario .",
    "this experimental trend agrees rather well with a thermal motion superimposed onto a collective velocity field which in the non - relativistic limit can be written as : @xmath1 @xmath2 is the flow energy per nucleon and @xmath3t@xmath3 stands for the effect of non - explicit treatment of coulomb effects in the above expression .",
    "this leads systematically to an overestimated value of the real temperature t @xcite . while this trend was qualitatively reproduced by the qmd microscopic transport model @xcite , the absolute value of mean kinetic energy per nucleon is systematically underestimated for all fragments .",
    "the experimental values were reproduced rather well by a hybrid model based on hydrodynamical expansion coupled with a statistical fragmentation at the break - up moment @xcite .",
    "this supports the model prediction that different species originate with different probabilities as a function of position within the fireball and time , heavier fragments being emitted later , at lower temperature and lower expansion .",
    "this was confirmed in the meantime by small angle correlations studies for pairs of nonidentical reaction species @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of experimental fopi - phase ii data based on the equation above was performed for three symmetric systems ( au+au , xe + csi , ni + ni ) , different incident energies and two regions of polar angles in the center of mass system for highly central collisions @xcite,@xcite .",

    "calculations based on iqmd model at 250 a@xmath0mev showed that the nucleons emitted at @xmath7 suffer in the average 3.5 collisions relative to 1.7 of those emitted at smaller polar angles .",
    "this tells that at @xmath7 the observed effect is most probably coming from an equilibrated fireball , while at forward angles the corona effects and uncertainty in impact parameter selection play an important role .",

    "the results presented above support the conclusion that the equation of state of baryonic matter at densities of about 2@xmath25 and temperatures of about 50 - 70 mev is soft .",
    "this conclusion seems to be also supported by kaon production in heavy ion collisions as it was shown by kaos collaboration @xcite .",
    "the experimental information obtained at ags , sps and rhic energies confirmed that the particle distributions reflect mainly the conditions reached by the system in its final state .",
    "therefore , information originating from earlier stages is mandatory in order to conclude whether the system passed through a partonic phase and extract information on such a phase . in central collisions , the final collective transverse , azimuthally isotropic flow , cumulates any collective flow generated during the evolution of the fireball , i.e. from the partonic and hadronic phases , the yield ratios reflecting mainly the statistical nature of the hadronization process",
    "this was nicely shown at rhic , by the star collaboration @xcite , by analyzing the transverse momentum distribution for common and rare particles using the blast wave model .",
    "the extracted kinetic freeze - out temperature and the flow velocity show a clear dependence as a function of centrality while the chemical freeze - out temperature , extracted from particle yield ratios using statistical model stays constant , at about 170 mev . at the same time",
    "the data seem to indicate a sequential freeze - out of particles , hyperons decoupling from the system earlier at temperatures closer to the chemical temperature value . as we have seen in the first part of the present paper , a useful observable for a detailed study of collective flow would be the mean kinetic energy as a function of mass of different species . in the following we shall present the results of a similar analysis , this time in terms of the average transverse momentum @xmath26 as a function of hadron mass for different colliding systems and energies . a careful examination of the experimental @xmath26 values @xcite as a function of mass for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , p and @xmath29 evidences that the slope increases going from p+p to cu+cu and au+au at the same incident energy , i.e. 200 a@xmath0gev .",

    "the temperature drops by @xmath37 20 mev and the expansion velocity is increasing from p+p towards heavy systems .",
