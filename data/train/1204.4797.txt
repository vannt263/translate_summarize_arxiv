    "kulczycki and the author  @xcite gave a general condition on a connected compact space which implies that it has a compatible metric making it a non - ifs - attractor .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that the cantor set has a metric such that it fails to be the attractor of even a countable system of contractions",
    ".    motivated by these results , we study topological properties of scattered ifs - attractors . it is easy to see that each finite set is an ifs - attractor in every metric space .",
