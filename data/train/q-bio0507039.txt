    "rna takes part in a variety of important cellular activities , including protein synthesis , intron splicing , gene silencing , and genome rearrangement ( lee et al . , 2002 ; mochizuki et al . , 2002 ; gratias & betermier , 2003 ; yang et al . ,",
    "2003 ) . considering the extensive functional repertoire of rna molecules , it is of interest to determine their ( functional ) native structures and to understand the ( kinetic ) process by which they fold into such structures .",
    "the native structures of rna molecules can be computed efficiently , at the functionally relevant secondary structure level , using free - energy minimization methods ( hofacker et al .",
    ", 1994 ; mathews et al . , 2004 ) or , in cases where sufficient homologous sequences are available , by phylogenetic comparisons ( woese & pace , 1993 ; cannone et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "several algorithms have been developed for studying the kinetic process by which rna molecules fold into their native secondary ( mironov & kister , 1985 ; morgan & higgs , 1996 ; flamm et al .",
    ", 2000 ; zhang & chen , 2000 ; wolfinger et al . , 2003 ; tang et al . , 2004 ; ndifon & nkwanta , 2005 ) and tertiary ( abrahams et al",
    ", 1990 ; gultyaev et al . , 1990 ; isambert , 2000 ; xayaphoumine et al . ,",
    "2003 ) structures .",
    "the majority of these algorithms ( e.g. , see isambert , 2000 ; xayaphoumine et al . , 2003 ; ndifon & nkwanta , 2005 ) operate on a helix - based move - set , involving the formation and dissociation of entire rna helices . on the other hand ,",
    "a few of the algorithms ( e.g. , see zhang & chen , 2000 ; wolfinger et al . ,",
    "2003 ) operate on a pair - based move - set ; they model the rna folding process as a time - series of structural transitions , involving the formation and dissociation of individual rna base pairs .",
    "flamm and colleagues ( flamm , 1998 ; flamm et al . , 2000 ) have extended the afore - mentioned pair - based move - set by introducing the concept of base pair _ shifting , _ which makes possible description of the biological process of defect - diffusion , believed to be an important feature of the _ in vivo _ folding kinetics of rna ( poerschke , 1974a ) . the folding model developed in this",
    "paper implements this extended pair - based move - set and is inspired by the theory of complex adaptive systems ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the applicability of the model is illustrated through several examples based on selected natural and synthetic rnas ( see section 4 ) .",
    "in particular , the folding kinetics of the yeast trna@xmath0 is shown to be strongly influenced by modifications to specific hairpin loops .",
    "in addition , a characteristic optimal folding temperature @xmath1 @xmath2 of trna@xmath0 , at which the native state exhibits maximal accessibility , is identified .",
    "furthermore , estimates are obtained for the population dynamics of two alternative stable states of sv11 , an rna species that is replicated by @xmath3 replicase ( zamora et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present some concepts related to rna secondary structures and folding kinetics .",
    "we introduce the theory of complex adaptive systems and discuss details of the new folding model in section [ themodel ] . in section applics",
    ", we apply the model to some example problems and discuss other possible applications in section [ concl ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be an arbitrary rna sequence of length @xmath5 .",
    "we think of @xmath4 as a string @xmath6 defined over the nucleotide alphabet @xmath7 .",
    "the nucleotides or bases of @xmath4 have a propensity to _ pair _ ( or form canonical and non - canonical bonds ) with each other . a pair formed by the bases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "two base pairs @xmath12 and @xmath13 are said to be compatible if either @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "if we let @xmath16 be the set of possible pairs that can be formed by the bases of @xmath4 , then a secondary structure @xmath17 of @xmath4 can be thought of as a set of mutually compatible base pairs drawn from @xmath18 the multiset consisting of all subsets of @xmath16 , including the empty set ( i.e. , the open chain ) , forms the conformation space of @xmath4 , denoted here by @xmath19 .",
    "note that incompatible base pairs form pseudoknots , which are prohibited from occurring in the folding model developed in this paper .",
    "the model can , however , be readily extended to allow the formation of pseudoknots once reliable thermodynamic parameters for such tertiary structural elements become available .",
    "the kinetic folding of an rna sequence @xmath4 at the coarse - grained secondary structure level can be thought of as a time - series of structural transitions , mediated by a set of operations called the move - set ( flamm , 1998 ) .",
    "each operation or _ move _ converts one secondary structure @xmath20 into another @xmath21 . for each structure @xmath22",
    ", the move - set defines a neighborhood @xmath23 such that @xmath24 @xmath25 belongs to @xmath23 if and only if @xmath26 @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the ( hamming ) distance between structures @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the `` move distance '' .",
    "only _ moves _ that convert @xmath29 into some @xmath32 are legal .",
    "the probability of a legal move is given by a rate equation , an example of which is the metropolis rule ( metropolis et al . , 1953 ) :",
    "@xmath33    where @xmath34 is the probability of converting @xmath29 into @xmath30 @xmath35 by a single _ move _ ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the free energies of @xmath38 and @xmath30 , computed using a suitable choice of free - energy parameters ( e.g. , mathews et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "conventional monte carlo rna folding algorithms execute in each time step @xmath39 a _ move _ that converts the nascent rna structure @xmath40 into some structure @xmath41 , where @xmath40 denotes the secondary structure of @xmath4 at time @xmath42 . the time - ordered series of structures @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the open chain , is called a folding trajectory of @xmath4 .",
    "the folding time @xmath46 associated with a given folding trajectory is the minimum value of @xmath42 for which @xmath40 is the native structure of @xmath4 .",
    "a folding trajectory satisfying the following condition is called a folding path ( flamm et al . , 2000 ) : @xmath47 if and only if @xmath48 .",
    "the rna folding model presented below is inspired by basic ideas from the theory of complex adaptive systems .",
    "specifically , a complex adaptive system ( cas ) is characterized by the presence of a diverse ensemble of components that engage in local interactions and an autonomous process that selects a subset of those components for enhancement based on the results of the local interactions ( levin , 1998 ) . from these component - level dynamics emerge important global ( i.e. , system - level ) properties such as self - organization and nonlinearity .",
    "self - organization refers to the emergence of order from local interactions between the components of a cas .",
    "self - organization tends to drive a cas towards stable configurations or states .",
    "in addition , a cas exhibits nonlinearity ; the rules that govern local interactions between the components of a cas change as the cas evolves ( levin , 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , a cas may evolve along any one of a multitude of trajectories and may attain alternative stable states ( levin , 1998 ) , depending on its particular evolutionary trajectory . see levin ( 1998 ) and the references therein for further information on cass .",
    "the kinetic folding of rna sequences into secondary structures is viewed here as a time - series of structural rearrangements ( srs ) , involving the formation , dissociation , and _ shifting _ of individual rna base pairs .",
    "it is modeled as a hierarchically - structured cas ; at the lowest level of the hierarchy are rna bases and base pairs that engage in local stacking interactions .",
    "the results of these stacking interactions determine the probabilities ( or fitnesses ) of possible srs .",
    "these probabilities are given by@xmath49@xmath50@xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are , respectively , the probabilities of formation and dissociation of @xmath12 , and of _ shifting _",
    "@xmath12 into @xmath55 @xmath56  is the gas constant , @xmath57 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath58 is the stacking ( including single - base stacking ) energy associated with @xmath59 . for an isolated base pair @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath60equation @xmath61 takes into account the entropy of a loop of size @xmath62 .",
    "a suitable value for the parameter @xmath63 is @xmath64 ( fisher , 1966 ) . stacking energy calculations",
    "are based on the turner @xmath65 energy rules ( mathews et al . , 1999 )",
    ", at temperature @xmath66 , and on the turner @xmath67 energy rules ( freier et al . , 1986 ) , at other temperatures",
    ". equations @xmath68 ,",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 are based on the kawasaki dynamics ( 1966 ) ; here , the dynamics involve transitions between states associated with specific local contexts of an rna secondary structure .",
    "the next level of the hierarchical structure is occupied by srs .",
    "it is at this level that selection operates .",
    "an autonomous stochastic sampling process ( baker , 1987 ) periodically ( i.e. , from one time step to another ) selects a subset of possible srs for realization based on the fitnesses of the srs .",
    "the ensemble of possible srs changes from one time step to another thereby assuring its diversity ( see below ) .",
    "note that due to the inter - dependence of local stacking interactions , on which the fitnesses of srs depend , it is necessary to ensure that the srs that are selected for realization in the same time step be mutually independent . therefore if there is an sr involving the base @xmath8 , then no other sr that involves the nearest - neighbor bases and base pairs of @xmath8 can occur in the same time step .",
    "furthermore , in order to prevent the formation of pseudoknots srs may only involve accessible bases ; two bases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are accessible if for @xmath71 there is no base pair @xmath72 @xmath73 such that @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) .    to understand the model just described ,",
    "consider the kinetic folding of an rna sequence @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath76 the set of possible srs that are available for realization in a given time step .",
    "@xmath76 will contain as many elements as there are structures in @xmath77 , where @xmath40 is the nascent structure of @xmath4 .",
    "each element of @xmath76 is associated with specific bases and base pairs that belong to that element s `` local context '' .",
    "for instance , an sr that involves the formation of the base pair @xmath59 is associated with @xmath12 and all nearest - neighbor bases and base pairs of @xmath12 . stacking interactions between the bases and base pairs associated with a given sr determine that sr s probability or fitness .",
    "this fitness is used periodically by an autonomous stochastic process to select a subset of srs from @xmath76 for realization .    as srs",
    "are realized ( and removed from @xmath76 ) , existing srs may be become impractical while new srs may become possible .",
    "for instance , the formation of @xmath12 in a given time step may make possible the _ shifting _ of @xmath12 into some @xmath78 in the next time step .",
    "conversely , the dissociation of @xmath12 in a given time step will render impractical the _ shifting _ of @xmath59 into some other base pair in the next time step .",
    "new srs that become possible are added to @xmath76 while those that become impractical are removed from @xmath76 .",
    "this assures the diversity of possible srs .",
    "note that the idea that the selective enhancement of components ( i.e. , srs in this case ) of a given system leads to their removal ( or elimination ) as well as the elimination of other components from that system appears to be at odds with what takes place in most known cass . in the present case ,",
    "the goal of selection is to , indirectly , enhance the thermal stabilities of the local contexts associated with srs .",
    "we note here that the inter - dependence of local stacking interactions , on which the fitnesses of srs depend , implies that a given sr may `` interact '' with many other srs . for instance , an sr that involves the base pair @xmath59 will `` interact '' with all srs that involve either of the bases @xmath79 and @xmath9 .",
    "this implies a relatively high average degree of `` epistatic '' interactions between srs .",
    "results from studies based on random boolean networks predict that such a high degree of epistasis leads to rugged fitness landscapes with numerous attractors ( kauffman and levin , 1987 ; kauffman , 1989 ) .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the well - known rugged nature of rna folding energy landscapes .",
    "we further note that srs , as defined in the model , operate at much more local scales of space than is the case with most existing folding methods ( e.g. , see flamm et al .",
    ", 2000 ; isambert et .",
    "al . , 2000 ;",
    "tang et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the fitnesses of srs depend exclusively on the stacking energies associated with specific local contexts of the nascent rna structure , @xmath40 , and not on the free - energies of structures found in @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , there is no need for explicit computation of the free - energies of rna structures in the present model , in contrast to , e.g. , the folding method of flamm et al .",
    "we expect the model to reproduce global characteristics of cass such as self - organization and nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , rna molecules are `` self - organizing '' since , through their own internal dynamics , they tend to fold into thermodynamically favorable or stable states .",
    "folding rna molecules also exhibit nonlinear dynamics , as evinced by their attainment of alternative stable states . in section 4",
    ", we will illustrate such nonlinear dynamics using an example based on sv11 .",
    "the above model has been implemented in the computer program _",
    "kfold _ , which is available from the author upon request .",
    "for an input rna sequence of length @xmath5 , the program selects @xmath80 sr , if @xmath81 , and @xmath82 srs , if @xmath83 , for realization in each time step .",
    "the folding time is incremented in each time step by the reciprocal of the product of @xmath84 and the sum of the fitnesses of all possible srs .",
    "the number of selected srs @xmath84 can be adjusted by the user .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath84 influences the computer time required to fold an input rna sequence but has minimal effect on the qualitative folding kinetics of the sequence ( see example in table 1 ) .",
    "also note that in order to speed up folding simulations , the program currently only allows the formation of base pairs that can be stacked .",
    "specifically , a base pair @xmath12 can be stacked if there exists complementary bases @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath87 such that either @xmath88 or @xmath89 @xmath90 .",

    "we found a @xmath119-shaped temperature dependence of @xmath46 ( see figure 2 ) , suggesting the existence of an optimal folding temperature @xmath120 .",
    "a possible explanation for the existence of @xmath1 is as follows : at temperatures @xmath121 , there are numerous structures with similar free - energies as the native cloverleaf .",
    "the native cloverleaf is therefore relatively unstable at temperatures above @xmath1 and may be associated with a much smaller basin of attraction in the energy landscape .",
    "it therefore takes the folding trna longer to `` find '' the cloverleaf among the ensemble of nonnative states . on the other hand , at temperatures @xmath122 , the stability of nonnative structures increases leading to a growth in the number and , perhaps , sizes of nonnative basins of attraction in the energy landscape .",
    "these nonnative basins of attraction may decrease the folding trna s chances of finding the native state . both scenarios ( i.e. , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) lead to suboptimal native state accessibilities .",
    "meanwhile , the maximal accessibility of the native state that is evident at @xmath123 suggests the existence at @xmath1 of optimal balance between the thermal stabilities of native and nonnative states .",
    "note that @xmath1 is close to the optimal growth temperature range for many yeast species .",

    "examples of such metastable rna molecules include riboswitches that regulate gene expression in bacteria by switching between alternative stable conformations ( vitreshack et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "by adopting a repressing conformation , a riboswitch can elicit the premature termination of dna transcription or the inhibition of protein translation .",
    "detailed _ in silico _ analysis of the folding kinetics of a metastable rna molecule can provide insight into its functionality .",
    "for instance , nagel et al . ( 1999 ) used computer simulations to identify a metastable structure of the _ hok _ mrna that mediates apoptosis in plasmid r1-free cells .",
    "the predictions made by their simulations were in good agreement with experimental data ( nagel , 1999 ) .",
    "see higgs ( 2000 ) for other examples of how computer simulations have yielded important insight into the folding kinetics of metastable rna molecules .",
    "sv11 is a 115nt synthetic rna species that exists in two alternative stable states , a rod - like stable conformation and a multi - component metastable conformation ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "while the metastable conformation is a template for q@xmath132 replicase , the stable conformation is not ( zamora et al .",
    "several authors have previously performed _ in silico _ analysis of the folding kinetics of sv11 .",
    "some of the authors ( flamm , 1998 ; flamm et al . , 2000 ) successfully predicted the existence of the metastable conformation while others ( e.g. , see gultyaev et al .",
    ", 1990 ; morgan & higgs , 1996 ) could only do so if folding was constrained to occur in conjunction with transcription .",
    "however , none of the authors obtained detailed theoretical estimates of the population dynamics of the molecule s two alternative stable states .     and",

    "as shown in figure 4 the population of the metastable state increases steadily , reaching a maximum after about @xmath135 . in experiments performed using _ kinfold _ , flamm ( 1998 )",
    "reported that the fraction of the metastable state reached about @xmath136 after @xmath137 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the results shown in figure 4 .",
    "however , we were able to fold the molecule for much longer , up to @xmath138 , than was done in flamm ( 1998 ) .",
    "this allowed us to estimate the population dynamics of not just the metastable conformation but also of the stable native conformation .",
    "the ratio of the fraction of simulations that found the native conformation to the fraction that found the metastable conformation in the time scale of the simulation was approximately @xmath96  to @xmath95 .",

    "in this paper , we introduced a new model for the kinetic folding of rna sequences into secondary structures that was inspired by the theory of complex adaptive systems . in the folding model ,",
    "rna bases and base pairs engage in local stacking interactions that determine the probabilities ( or fitnesses ) of possible rna structural rearrangements ( srs ) .",
    "meanwhile , selection operates at the level of srs ; an autonomous stochastic sampling process periodically selects a subset of possible srs for realization based on the fitnesses of the srs .",
    "several examples were used to illustrate the applicability of the model . in particular , certain base modifications were shown to substantially improve the foldability of trna@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , a characteristic optimal folding temperature @xmath140 of trna@xmath0 was identified .",
    "furthermore , the model was used to confirm previous experimental results ( zamora et al . , 1995 ) regarding the existence of two alternative stable states of the q@xmath132 variant sv11 , and to obtain ( experimentally verifiable ) estimates of the population dynamics of those states .",
    "the above examples demonstrated , among other things , the emergence from ( local ) srs of nonlinear rna folding dynamics ( i.e. , the realization of alternative stable states ) .",
    "other possible applications of the model are discussed below .",
    "the analysis of properties of fitness landscapes is currently of interest to researchers in a wide range of fields including the life , computer , and social sciences ( e.g. , see hadany & beker , 2003 ; mccarthy , 2004 ; skellett et al . ,",
    "a number of interesting general features of these landscapes such as positive correlations between the degree of epistasis , the number of local optima , and the expected value of the global optimum have thus far been elucidated in the context of adaptive walks on landscapes generated by random boolean networks ( rbns ) ( kauffman & levin , 1987 ; kauffman , 1989 ; skellett et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the simplicity of rbns and their accessibility to some degree of mathematical analysis make them convenient for use as generators of fitness landscapes . however , some of the general properties of such rbn - generated landscapes may differ from those of landscapes found in nature .",
    "rna folding kinetics , as modeled in this paper , could serve as a generator of , and therefore assist the analysis of properties of `` natural '' fitness landscapes ( i.e. , rna folding energy landscapes ) . note that this proposed use of rna in the investigation of fitness landscapes differs from the previous related use of the rna sequence to structure mapping ( schuster & stadler , 1994 ) , which was not based on folding kinetics .",
    "the model could also be used to study the rna sequence to structure ( or genotype to phenotype ) mapping , from a kinetics perspective .",
    "previous investigations , based on the thermodynamics of rna folding , have made several important findings about the rna sequence to structure mapping such as the existence of ( 1 ) extended neutral networks of sequences that fold into the same secondary structures ( 2 ) few common or `` typical '' structures , realized with relatively high frequencies , and ( 3 ) many rare structures that have little or no evolutionary significance ( schuster et al .",
    ", 1994 ; schuster et al . ,",
    "these findings , together with results from thermodynamics - based rna optimization experiments ( fontana & schuster , 1998 ) , have confirmed previous hypotheses on , and shed light into several important features of the process of molecular evolution , including the role of neutrality in adaptation and the existence of continuous / discontinuous transitions or punctuated equilibria in evolutionary trajectories .",
    "it would be interesting to determine how the nature of the rna sequence to structure mapping , as obtained from thermodynamic folding experiments , changes when rna folding kinetics is taken into account .",
    "it is also possible that an investigation of the genotype to phenotype mapping based on the kinetics of rna folding will yield further insight into the process of molecular evolution .",
