    "conductive oxides are essential components in composite oxide heterostructures where they are often used as electrode materials in thin film applications.@xcite in the perovskite crystal family ( @xmath3o@xmath1 stoichiometry ) , the itinerant ferromagnetic srruo@xmath1 ( sro ) is a popular choice since it is one of the more conductive metallic oxides with good thermal properties.@xcite in thin films , sro is intensely investigated as a possible route to the realization of novel field - effect devices.@xcite in addition , it is of particular interest to the spintronic@xcite and multiferroic@xcite communities , which have been recently energized by the possible device applications available from engineering interface phenomena.@xcite however , one limitation in the design of thin film oxide devices is the observation of increased resistivity in metal oxides as the film thickness decreases . such behavior is clearly present in ultra - thin films of srruo@xmath1 , where a metal - to - insulator ( mi ) transition@xcite occurs at four monolayers .",
    "this substantial change in the electrical conductivity presents a serious challenge for device miniaturization . in this work",
    "we explore the underlying physics of the thin film mi - transition , which to date remain to be understood .",
    "the 3@xmath0 transition metal oxides ( tmos ) are known to possess strong electron - electron correlation effects that can drive a system that should be metallic within a simple band picture into an insulating state . due to the large spatial extent of the 4@xmath0-orbitals in the ruthenates , correlation effects",
    "are anticipated to be less important as stronger hybridization provides more effective screening and a reduced hubbard @xmath2 ( coulomb repulsion energy ) .",
    "many experimental studies have already addressed the degree of electron - electron correlation in srruo@xmath1 including x - ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy,@xcite specific heat measurements,@xcite infrared and optical conductivity measurements,@xcite and transport experiments.@xcite for example , kim and coworkers@xcite use x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) to identify how such correlations change within the ruthenate family , and toyota _",
    "et al._@xcite use photemission spectroscopy ( pes ) to detail the metal - insulator transition in srruo@xmath1 as a function of film thickness concomitant with the onset of magnetism . in all of these studies ,",
    "the general consensus is that electron correlation effects _ do _ play a role in determining the electronic structure of this itinerant ferromagnet , but to what degree remains unclear .",
    "furthermore , some theoretical investigations have begun examining covalency,@xcite correlation@xcite and orbital ordering@xcite effects in bulk srruo@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic properties of sro under epitaxial strain have also been investigated with first - principles techniques.@xcite in this work , first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations are performed , first to identify the degree of correlation in bulk sro , and second to investigate the driving force for the metal - insulator transition in ultra - thin films .",
    "we use two approaches to introduce correlation effects into the conventional band theory ( local spin density ) approach for treating the ru 4@xmath0-orbitals and their hybridization with o 2@xmath4-orbitals : the local spin density + hubbard @xmath2 ( lsda+@xmath2 ) , and the pseudopotential self - interaction corrected ( pseudo - sic ) local spin density methods .",
    "in addition we investigate two structural variants  the ideal cubic perovskite structure and the experimentally observed orthorhombic structure , which includes tiltings and rotations of the ruo@xmath5 octahedra . by comparing the results that we obtained for both methods and both structure types , we are able to comment on the nature of the metal - insulator transition in ultra - thin films .",
    "the perovskite class of materials is described by a network of corner - sharing @xmath6o@xmath5 octahedra , in which the @xmath7-site cation is located at the center of a cube defined by eight @xmath6o@xmath5 units .",
    "the ideal perovskite is cubic ( space group @xmath8 ) , however several modifications exist owing to the range of cation sizes that can be accommodated in the structure .",
    "deviations from the ideal cubic structure are defined by the goldschmidt tolerance factor @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the radius of atom @xmath11 , and can be attributed to the requirement to optimize the anion coordination about the @xmath7-site cation.@xcite using the shannon - prewitt radii for this compound , a predicted tolerance factor of @xmath12=0.908 is found , which is far from the ideal case @xmath12=1 , suggesting that distortions should occur .",
    "indeed , sro undergoes a series of structural transformations with temperature , from high symmetry cubic ( @xmath8 , stable above 950  k ) to tetragonal ( @xmath13 , stable between 820  k and 950  k ) to distorted orthorhombic structure ( @xmath14 ) at low temperatures .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion from the ideal cubic can be described by the tilting of the ruo@xmath5 octahedra in alternate directions away from the @xmath15 axis , and the rotation of the octahedra around the @xmath16 axis ; in both cases adjacent octahedra distort in the opposite sense ( figure [ fig : structures ] ) .",

    "the deviation in the structure from the high symmetry cubic state can be quantified using the tilting angle @xmath17 and the rotation angle @xmath18 of the oxygen octahedra.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    the degree of tilting and rotation ( as defined in fig .",

    "the structural changes reduce the hybridization between the ru 4@xmath0 states and o 2@xmath4 states and lead to a narrowing of the bandwidths ( see section [ rd ] ) compared with the ideal cubic case .",

    "is due in part to the large spatial extent of the ru 4@xmath0 orbitals , which results in a significant overlap ( hybridization ) with the oxygen 2@xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , due to the metallic character of sro , an overlap of the majority and minority ru 4@xmath0 bands occurs at the fermi level ; as a result partial occupation of the minority band also leads to a reduced magnetic moment . in this work",

    "the shortcomings of the lsda in describing the spin polarization at the fermi level in srruo@xmath1 are again apparent .",
    "the highest spin polarization obtained with the lsda for the orthorhombic structure is -15% and it is obtained in the diffusive limit .",

    "[ fig : transport ] , on changing from @xmath51 to @xmath50 the polarization increases and becomes more negative .",

    "[ fig : transport ] it is then clear that the large negative polarization is a consequence of the center of the _ majority _ ru 4@xmath0 band positioned approximately 1  ev below the fermi level , while the _ minority _ ru 4@xmath0 band center is aligned across the fermi level .",
    "further enhancement is seen by introducing correlation ; for example , by correcting for the si error , the spin polarization increases due to the reduction of the number of majority ru @xmath24 states at the fermi level . the correlated _ ab initio _ calculations now give very high spin polarization , ranging between -85.7% and -98.0% where as the highest value achieved experimentally is just 60% .",

    "pes techniques , and it was found that the sharp @xmath24 peak at the fermi level is greatly suppressed at the surface , while it persists at the interface.@xcite the decrease in itineracy due to the suppressed dos at the fermi level was also verified with surface and interface conductivity experiments . since our calculations do not include any disordered surface configurations or non - stoichiometry , future first - principles calculations could clarify these competing interactions .",
    "we have however shown that neither strong correlations nor octahedral distortions , nor their combination are sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed ultra - thin film metal - insulator transition .",
    "we have examined the effects of structural distortions and correlation effects on the electronic and magnetic properties of srruo@xmath1 with first - principles calculations .",
    "we find that by including weak strong - correlations with an effective hubbard @xmath2 of 0.6  ev or correction of the self - interaction error gives good agreement for bulk orthorhombic srruo@xmath1 with the experimental spectroscopic data .",
    "the addition of the octahedral distortions leads to a narrowing of the majority spin ru @xmath24 and o 2@xmath4 states ; however the exchange splitting is small with respect to these bandwidths and consequently a fully insulating ground state is not obtained .",
    "a half - metallic ground state was shown to be stable by including moderate electron - electron correlation effects @xmath68  ev , which we note has not been observed experimentally .",
    "the behavior of thin films was also examined in both cubic and orthorhombic unsupported films within the conventional lsda approach and with weak correlations included . in neither case",
    "was the experimentally observed metal - insulator transition obtained .",
    "since the electronic structures of surfaces are very sensitive to atomic reconstructions , we suggest that the experimentally observed metal - insulator transition could be a consequence of extrinsic defects or an atomically disordered surface configuration .",
