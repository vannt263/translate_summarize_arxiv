    "these detections allow us to compare the x - ray properties of gps / cso galaxies with those of other radio loud agn .",
    "the results presented here support the hypothesis that gps / cso galaxies represent the young phases in the evolution of radio - loud agn .",
    "the alternative explanation that the radio sources are compact due to confinement by an exceptionally high density of the interstellar medium in those galaxies , seems extremely unlikely in view of the low intrinsic x - ray absorption column densities , which ranges from @xmath51  @xmath8  to @xmath9  @xmath8 , and has a distribution similar to other radio loud agn .",
    "after submission of our manuscript , a preprint by @xcite arrived at apparently different conclusions based on a sample of five different gps galaxies observed by _",
    "chandra _  and _",
    "xmm - newton_. only one of the five gps galaxies in their sample has @xmath52@xmath53",
    "@xmath8 , whereas this is 75%@xmath5426% for their control sample .",
    "note , however , that in our sample three out of five have @xmath52@xmath53  @xmath8 . taking both samples together",
    ", this means that four out of ten gps galaxies , or 40%@xmath5420% have @xmath52@xmath53  @xmath8  consistent with the control sample .",
    "the fact that the absorption columns toward gps galaxies are consistent with those of other radio galaxies suggests that the interstellar medium densities in the cores of gps / cso galaxies are similar to those of other radio loud agn .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite based on hi radio absorption observations , but the x - ray data provide stronger constraints , as the total column density contributes to the absorption , including ionized regions of the interstellar medium .",
    "this may contribute to the fact that in all cases the x - ray column densities are higher than the hi column densities .",
    "a difference between the radio column densities and the x - ray column densities is also that the x - ray column is measured toward the central source , whereas the hi column density is toward the jets , which extend outside the central region .",
    "if the difference between radio and x - ray column density is dominated by those geometrical effects , this would be additional evidence against the confinement scenario , since the jets have apparently been able to pierce through the dense local regions that contribute most to the x - ray absorption column .",
    "although the @xmath4  distribution of our sample can not be distinguished from other radio - loud agn , the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity shows that gps galaxies have a strong tendency to be relatively radio bright .",
    "this supports the view that for the same thrust of the jets younger radio sources are relatively bright @xcite .",
    "however , the data is inconclusive concerning whether gps - galaxies represent the most radio - luminous phases in the lifes of radio - loud agn , as would be the case if the source develops in a density profile that drops of as power law with distance @xcite , or whether they are still in their brightening phase",
    ". this would be the case if the interstellar medium is best described by a king profile with a relative uniform density within @xmath181  kpc of the center and then dropping of as a power law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case the brightest evolutionary phase of radio - loud agn would be represented by the compact steep spectrum sources ( css ) , which have more extended radio emission than gps / cso galaxies .",
    "a similar study to this one concerning css - galaxies can clarify this issue .    finally , we find that gps / cso galaxies are relatively weak in  line emission .",
    "this is again in support of the idea that gps / cso galaxies represent the very earliest stages of the evolution of radio - loud agn , since narrow line regions need time to build up to their equilibrium size , and young narrow line regions are therefore not as bright as fully developed ones .",
    "the narrow line region is powered by the uv flux of the central source , but also shocks induced by the expanding jets are likely to contribute to their formation . for those very young radio - loud agn we advocate here that their emission line regions are powered by the uv flux from the central sources . a case in point",
    "is that the relatively weakest source , b0108 + 388 , has also the highest x - ray column density , which suggests that a dusty torus is partially blocking the uv light .",
    "the low  luminosity therefore shows that the birth of the narrow emission line region must coincide more or less with the birth of the radio jet .",
    "however , we caution that we only have a limited knowledge of the nature of the ionization mechanism for the [ o iii ] line emission .",
    "i.e. both shocks from the jets , as the uv radiation from the agn may contribute to the ionization . moreover , compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , probably representing a more advanced evolutionary state of radio galaxies than gps galaxies , show that the forbidden line emission tends to be aligned with the radio jet @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is not well understood , but it should be accounted for if one wants to build a more detailed model of the evolution of emission line nebulae in radio galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "the findings from this x - ray study lends further support to the theory that gps / cso galaxies represent the early phases of radio - loud agn , in which also the narrow line emission nebula is still in the early phases of its evolution .",
    "future x - ray studies may help to further clarify the relation between age or jet - size , the extent or brightness of the emission line region and the power of the x - ray emission .",
    "it is important to include also compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources in such a study , as they are likely to represent the next phase in the evolution of radio - loud agn .",
    "comparing their x - ray to radio luminosity may help clarify whether the radio emission declines already during the gps - phase , or first increases , then peaks around the css - phase and from then on weakens .",

    "<S> + 3 ) taking the x - ray luminosity of radio sources as a measure of their ionisation power , we find that gps / cso sources are significantly underluminous in their [ oiii]@xmath6 line luminosity , including a weak trend with age . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that the strmgren sphere should still be expanding in these young objects . </S>",
    "<S> if true , this would mean that here we are witnessing the birth of the narrow line region of radio - loud agn .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    galaxies : active  x - ray : galaxies    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      an alternative explanation for the small extent of the radio jets in gps / cso galaxies that is still often considered in the literature @xcite is that the radio jets are quenched by a high density in the vicinity of the nucleus , in other words they are `` frustrated radio sources '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from table  [ tab - res ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - nhd ] that this is unlikely to be the case , as the intrinsic x - ray absorption is similar to other radio - loud agn , with column densities ranging from a relatively modest @xmath7  @xmath8  to a considerably large @xmath9  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite based on hi radio absorption observations of a large sample of compact radio sources , and by @xcite from upper limits to the molecular gas content in gps sources . </S>",
    "<S> note that the x - ray absorption gives more stringent constraints on the actual gas column densities than hi and molecular absorption densities , as x - ray absorption depends on the total column toward the central source , whereas radio observations only probe the neutral fraction of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite an important distinction since agn are expected to create an extended ionised region , as we discuss in section  [ sec - oiii ] . furthermore , x - ray absorption probes the gas toward the accretion disk , whereas the radio absorption probes the neutral gas toward the radio source , which is situated at larger radii . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not surprising that for the four galaxies in our sample for which also hi absorption measurements have been made the hi column is always one to two orders of magnitude lower than the x - ray absorption column ( table  [ tab - nh ] and fig .  [ fig - nh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> attributing the difference solely to ionisation effects would mean ionisation fractions of 90% to 99% . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ionisation fractions are likely to be lower , because a substantial part of the x - ray absorption may occur inside the central 100  pc , which is not probed by absorption toward the radio hot spots .    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found a strong anti - correlation between the linear size of the radio emission and the hi column density , which they use to probe the average density profile of the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> they do not consider ionisation effects , whereas this could be an additional cause for the observed anti - correlation : small jets are associated with young agn , which do therefore not yet have an extended narrow line emission region of ionised gas ( see section  [ sec - oiii ] ) . if this is the case it makes it less straightforward to derive an average interstellar medium density profile from the relation between @xmath10  and linear size of the radio emission , since the growth of the emission line region also depends on the density and uv luminosity of the agn .      </S>",
    "<S> usually a high [ o iii ] luminosity is taken as an indication for the presence of a powerful agn , but fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlations ] indicates that gps / cso galaxies are relatively underluminous in [ o iii ] compared to their radio or x - ray flux </S>",
    "<S> . this may not be too surprising if one takes into account that these are young radio galaxies , in which the agn has switched on only a few thousand years ago . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that it takes time to establish a large emission line region by photo - ionisation . </S>",
    "<S> this is best illustrated by a simple calculation , for which we assume an average interstellar medium density of 1  @xmath11  and a typical luminosities of @xmath12 } } } = 42 $ ] , and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the number rate of ionising photons ( i.e. @xmath14 ev ) is @xmath15 ph s@xmath2  for a power law spectrum with photon index -1.75 . comparing this to the total number of hydrogen atoms within a typical region of 5  kpc radius @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that @xmath16 atoms have to be ionised . </S>",
    "<S> in other words the central source has to shine for at least @xmath17  s , or @xmath18300,000 yr before it has completely ionized a region with a radius of 5  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this means that if an agn has become only recently active it must be surrounded by a small , but rapidly expanding ionisation nebula ( see * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * for a calculation concerning the first generation of quasars ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this would imply that in gps / cso galaxies we see the birth of the narrow line region of radio - loud agn .    in order to see whether this is the reason that gps / cso galaxies are relatively underluminous in [ o iii ] we consider a simplified model for the evolution of a strmgen sphere . for </S>",
    "<S> an old ionisation nebula in equilibrium , the number rate of ionising photons ( @xmath19 ) should equal the number of recombinations , from which follows the equilibrium radius , @xmath20 , of a strmgen sphere : @xmath21 with @xmath22  the hydrogen recombination coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the initial rapid expansion of the ionisation nebula is described by e.g. @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24  the radius of the ionisation front and @xmath25  the time since the central source switched on . for small @xmath26 </S>",

    "<S> there may be various reasons why this is not the case : e.g. the interstellar medium density varies from galaxy to galaxy , their is no simple proportionality between @xmath34 and @xmath19 , due to different spectral energy distributions ( different spectral slopes , or spectral breaks ) , and shocks induced by jet cloud interactions may provide an additional source of ionisation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one of the outliers is b1358 + 624 , for which we only have an approximate age .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a hint of what may the prime reason for deviations from eq .  [ eq - scaling ] </S>",
    "<S> is provided by the very low  luminosity of b0108 + 388 , because this is also the source with the highest absorption column ( table  [ tab - res ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the most likely reason that the optical emission is lower than expected is that the ionising uv flux is blocked by absorbing material close to the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing material is probably not the result of neutral hydrogen and helium , as , being close to the nucleus it would be ionised almost immediately , but dust grains , which may survive the extreme conditions close to the nucleus for 1000  yr to @xmath35  yr , depending on the destruction mechanisms and dust particle sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a young source like b0108 + 388 this means that an appreciable amount of dust may still enshroud the nucleus , frustrating the formation of a narrow emission line region . </S>",
    "<S> note that this may also explain the relatively high neutral hydrogen column density of b0108 + 388 ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - nh ] ) ; the hydrogen ionisation fraction of the inner stellar medium is likely to be low , which would also support the idea that photo - ionisation is the dominant source of ionisation . </S>",
    "<S> if ionisation is dominated by shocks generated by the jet , one would expect that b0108 + 388 would be relatively bright in  as its interstellar medium density is apparently high . </S>",
    "<S> b1358 + 624 deviates less from the expected relation in the right hand panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - opt - age ] due to its relatively flat x - ray spectrum , which makes that the number flux of uv photons is relatively small with respect to the x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , since we do not know the broad band spectral shape , we do not want to overemphasise this .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the possible implications of dust absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the optical depth of dust particles depends on dust particles cross sections ( @xmath36 with @xmath37 the physical size of the particles , @xmath38 m ) and the column density of dust particles @xmath39 . to obtain an order of magnitude estimate </S>",
    "<S> we assume that most dust particles consist of silicates , and that all silicon is depleted into dust . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath40 , and a typical dust particle density is @xmath41  g @xmath11 , we have @xmath42 , and the optical depth should be around @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that dust particles absorb an appreciable amount of uv flux if the hydrogen column density is comparable to , or exceeds , @xmath44@xmath8 , which is only the case for b0108 + 388 . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore extrapolated from the observed @xmath34  the ionising photon luminosity @xmath19  using the observed spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> plotting now @xmath45}}}$ ]  as a function of @xmath46 we see less scatter , certainly if we allow for dust absorption ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - opt - age ] ) . in order to bring b0108 + 388 on the expected relation we need a conversion of @xmath4 to dust optical depth that is 16% of the above order magnitude estimate . note that in a log - log plot the absorption enters linearly , since @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , only b0108 + 388 is likely to be significantly affected by dust absorption .    </S>",
    "<S> the large uncertainties in extrapolating from the observed @xmath34  to an ionising uv flux makes that we can not use fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - opt - age ] ( right panel ) to prove that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - scaling ] is an accurate description , but it makes it at least plausible that for gps / cso galaxies the  emission is relatively low due to an underdeveloped narrow emission line region . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the idea that gps - galaxies have agn that switched on around the same time that the radio jets were formed .    </S>",
    "<S> further support for the idea that gps / cso galaxies are in the process of creating an extended narrow line region comes from the fact that neutral hydrogen apparently extends close to the compact radio jets , given the fact that there is strong anti - correlation between the neutral hydrogen column density and jet - size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that gps / cso galaxies have sizes of the order of a few 100  pc , whereas narrow emission line regions can extend up to 10  kpc .      </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from agn is thought to come predominantly from the immediate vicinity of the central black hole , i.e. thermal emission from the accretion disk reprocessed by the hot plasma in its vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> it is unlikely that synchrotron radiation from the jet makes a dominant contribution to the x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that , given the typical magnetic fields infered from radio luminosities ( @xmath48  mg , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) , the synchrotron cooling time relevant for x - ray synchrotron radiation is in the order of only 2  yr for an electron energy of 10  erg . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a very small fraction of the total radio jet volume could produce x - ray synchrotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> another potential source of x - ray emission from outside the central region could be inverse compton emission by the relativistic electron population in the jets ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not totally exclude a significant inverse compton contribution , it seems unlikely to be the case for our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the x - ray emission should in that case come from the same locations as the radio emission ( the bright regions in the jets ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we would then expect that the measured x - ray absorption columns would be more consistent with radio absorption measurements toward the jets , which is not the case ( section  [ sec - nh ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore reasonable to assume that , compared to the radio and  luminosity , the x - ray luminosity is more directly related to the accretion power of the agn . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the radio and optical luminosities are still indirectly related to the accretion power , given the correlations between radio , optical and x - ray luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , interesting that gps / cso galaxies seem on average radio bright compared to the x - ray luminosity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlations ] ) . given the absorption column distribution and low emission </S>",
    "<S> , we can ignore the interpretation that the radio emission is relatively bright because the interstellar medium is dense in gps / cso galaxies , as argued by advocates of the `` frustrated radio source '' scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , very probable that gps / cso galaxies are radio bright because they are young . </S>",
    "<S> however , within our sample no relation between age and radio over x - ray ratio can be seen ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - radio - age ] ) , nor is there a correlation with column density .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the fact that for the sample as a whole the radio to x - ray luminosity is brighter than for other radio - loud agn is at least qualitatively in agreement with several radio evolution models , such as @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models describe the evolution of radio jets , with radio brightnesses depending on the radial density distribution of the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the radio jets are relatively bright as long as the they plow through the dense regions of the galaxies , but decline as soon as they propagate outside the core of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the various models is that some assume a density distribution described by a king profile @xcite , whereas others assume a density profile falling of as power law of radius @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the non - power law models predict that galaxies in the gps - phase are still increasing in radio luminosity in time , until the jet has reached the core radius of @xmath49  kpc , after which the luminosity declines . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the relatively brightest phase of radio galaxies would be represented by the so - called compact steep spectrum sources ( css ) , which have more extended radio jets than gps / cso sources . </S>",
    "<S> the power law density models predict that right after the jet emerges from the core region the radio emission starts to decline .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are inconclusive regarding the details of the early evolution of the radio luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , future x - ray observations of css galaxies could help to clarify the brightness evolution further , as models with a king profile predict that css galaxies should , on average , have a higher radio to x - ray luminosity ratio than gps / cso galaxies , whereas models that assume power law density profiles predict that css galaxies should have a smaller radio to x - ray luminosity . </S>"
