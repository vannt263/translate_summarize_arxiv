    "the well known generalized wick theorem for interacting fields in two dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) is given as follows .",
    "it was originally presented by bais , bouwknegt , surridge and schoutens @xcite in 1988 , and described more precisely in a standard textbook of conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 here , @xmath1 etc .",
    "are operators for chiral conformal fields , @xmath2 denotes the normally ordered product , @xmath3 denotes the contraction , i.  e.  the singular part of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and @xmath4 is a contour encircling the point @xmath5 with an infinitesimal radius .",
    "it is a natural question to ask whether an analogous expression exists for the contraction @xmath6 in which a normally ordered operator is on the left and a single operator is on the right . as far as the author knows",
    ", no one had correctly answered this question yet .",
    "so we tried to answer it and found the following expression @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 here the normal ordering for the first term in the integrand is for dropping the singular terms arising in the ope of @xmath8 and the coefficients of the contraction on its right hand .",
    "we note that even in one can replace the second term by @xmath9 which makes the two formulas apparently more analogous , but usually do not do so because the singular terms are automatically dropped by the integral in .",
    "it is a rather remarkable fact that such a really simple formula has not been found until today over a quarter of a century after . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly describe a proof of the generalized wick theorem based on the borcherds identity , and also sketch the idea of its derivation by an analytic method . in section [ sec:3 ] we present examples of the calculations of the operator product expansions by using the generalized wick theorems including fermionic fields . for reasons of simplicity ,",
    "i will omit almost all mathematically rigorous arguments which are available in @xcite for interested readers .",
    "for a mathematical formulation of two - dimensional chiral quantum fields we adopt the one given by matsuo and nagatomo in 1999 @xcite .",
    "we express the operator @xmath10 as a formal power series @xmath11 and divide it into its positive and negative parts in this way . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 are linear transformations on some vector space @xmath13 .",
    "we define the normally ordered product of @xmath10 and @xmath14 as follows @xmath15 then it turns out to be regular at @xmath16 in a sense .",
    "now we want to introduce an important notion called the @xmath17th residue product .",
    "its definition is given by the following formula for non - negative @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 ( y - z)^n .",
    "\\label{eq : oct20_1}\\ ] ] then , we define the contraction as follows .",
    "@xmath19 and we have such an operator product expansion @xmath20 in the region @xmath21 . by slightly modifying the expression in , we can define the residue product also for negative @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we frequently use the fact that the minus first residue product is equal to the normally ordered product @xmath22 we note that sometimes we write the definition simply as even for negative @xmath17 just as an abbreviation .",
    "now we want to introduce the borcherds identity .",
    "first we write the usual jacobi identity in this way @xmath23,c ] = [ a,[b , c ] ] - [ b,[a , c]].\\ ] ] from this jacobi identity , matsuo and nagatomo derived such an identity .",
    "@xmath24 here we omitted the arguments of the operators that assumed to be @xmath5 in what follows .",
    "the small brackets in the subscripts mean that we are taking the residue products twice .",
    "this is the so - called borcherds identity known as one of the axioms for a vertex algebra @xcite .",
    "matsuo and nagatomo proved that it is valid for any integer @xmath25 , under the assumption of a property called the locality of quantum fields .",
    "now let us consider a specialization of this identity by setting @xmath26 and @xmath27 for non - negative @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 in his famous book @xcite , kac derived this identity by his own method and called it the  non - commutative \" wick formula . as he pointed out , for free fields the last term vanishes and it reduces to the usual wick theorem for free fields .",
    "he also pointed out its equivalence to the generalized wick theorem .",
    "a proof of this equivalence is available in @xcite      now we want to show that our new generalized wick theorem is equivalent to another specialization of the borcherds identity . to begin with we prepare some formulas .",
    "one easily proves @xmath30 for any integer @xmath17 . by changing @xmath17 by @xmath31 and using this relation",
    "repeatedly we obtain @xmath32 hence @xmath33 for any non - negative integer @xmath17 . here",
    "now the first term in the integral of our formula @xmath35 can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath36 here we replaced @xmath8 by its taylor expansion around @xmath5 and then used the above formula . by multiplying @xmath37 and integrating over @xmath38 around @xmath5 , only the singular terms survive , and then all the @xmath38 s are replaced by @xmath39 s . then by setting @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 now let us consider the second term of the integrand of our formula .",
    "we divide it into the singular part and the regular part .",
    "@xmath42 by the same argument as above it turns out to be @xmath43 after the calculation of the integral .",
    "we can put these terms together , by deleting the second term and by changing the lower bound of the summation over @xmath44 in the first term by @xmath45 .",
    "then by setting @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 from these results we find that our new generalized wick theorem is equivalent to @xmath48 as you can see , this is nothing but a specialization of the borcherds identity with @xmath49 .      as we have just shown , once you have obtained the expression for our new generalized wick theorem , you can check its validity by simply calculating the integrals and then by comparing the result with the borcherds identity .",
    "however , it is a natural question to ask how you can come up with such an expression . in the remaining part of this section ,",
    "we want to answer this question . we are going to sketch the idea for deriving our new formula by using an analytic method .    by definition",
    "the nested residue product @xmath50 is given by evaluating the residues twice for a nested commutator of the operators .",
    "we rewrite this expression by using contour integrals as @xmath51 , c(w ) ]   ( y - x)^{-1 } ( x - w)^{p}\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi \\sqrt{-1})^2 } \\left\\ { \\oint_{c_{3}}\\!\\!\\!d x \\oint_{c_{4}}\\!\\!\\!d y -\\oint_{c_{4}}\\!\\!\\!d x \\oint_{c_{3}}\\!\\!\\!d y -\\oint_{c_{1}}\\!\\!\\!d x \\oint_{c_{2}}\\!\\!\\!d y + \\oint_{c_{2}}\\!\\!\\!d x \\oint_{c_{1}}\\!\\!\\!d y \\right\\ }   a(y)b(x)c(w )   \\frac{(x - w)^{p}}{(y - x)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the four terms are arising from the expansion of the nested commutators .",
    "the contours @xmath52 are those encircling the origin with increasing radii , and the point @xmath5 is between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "[ 1 ]     we let @xmath54 and @xmath55 shrink to @xmath56 and @xmath53 respectively , so that they are going to cancel out each other .",
    "but of course by deforming them they pick up the singularity at the point @xmath5 .",
    "so we have the following expression .",
    "@xmath57 here , the contours @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given as in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . by multiplying @xmath60 and then taking a summation over @xmath28 from @xmath61 to infinity",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 let us consider the second term first . by taking the minus sign into account , its inner integral",
    "is given by this expression : @xmath63 since this is an integral over the variable @xmath64 around the point @xmath5 , it picks up the singular part of the operator product expansion of @xmath65 and then replaces @xmath64 by @xmath38 , hence the above result . after the outer integral over @xmath38 we obtain the second term of our generalized wick theorem .",
    "now let us consider the first term .",
    "first we write this factor @xmath66 as a difference like this : @xmath67 then the inner integral over @xmath38 is expressed as @xmath68 just like the previous calculation , we obtain the result of integrals as above .",
    "now let us consider the outer integral over @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath69 the regular part of the second term vanishes by itself because it has no singularity at @xmath70 .",
    "the singular parts of the first and the second terms cancel out each other after integration .",
    "thus , there remains only the regular part of the first term as above . by changing @xmath64 by @xmath38",
    ", we obtain the first term of our generalized wick theorem .",
    "let @xmath71 be the current of a free bosonic field satisfying @xmath72 and define the energy momentum tensor as @xmath73 then by using we have @xmath74 now by we obtain @xmath75 this is the ope for the cft with the central charge @xmath76 .",
    "here we used the relation @xmath77 that is due to the following skew symmetry @xcite @xmath78",
    "for any field @xmath79 let @xmath80 be its parity , i.  e.  @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath82 ) if @xmath79 is a bosonic ( resp .",
    "fermionic ) field @xcite .",
    "then the extension of the generalized wick theorems to including fermionic fields should be given by @xmath83 in what follows we present two simplest non - trivial examples to illustrate their validity .",
    "let @xmath84 be the free fermion satisfying @xmath85 define the energy momentum tensor @xmath86 as @xmath87 by we have @xmath88 and hence @xmath89 now by we have @xmath90 the two terms in the integrand can be written as @xmath91 and @xmath92 by summing them up and expanding the numerators around @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 where ",
    "@xmath95 \" denote the terms that are regular at @xmath96 .",
    "therefore @xmath97 this is the ope for the cft with the central charge @xmath98 .",
    "one can also use to calculate @xmath99 implying that @xmath100 is a primary field with conformal dimension @xmath101 .",
    "this is because the terms in the integrand can be written as @xmath102      in this section we describe applications of the generalized wick theorems , to the so - called @xmath103 ghost system @xcite .",
    "let @xmath104 be a pair of fermions satisfying @xmath105 we define @xmath106 by we have @xmath107 and also @xmath108 then by and we have @xmath109 thus the field @xmath71 is a free bosonic current .    also by we have @xmath110 in the same way we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 for any @xmath113 let @xmath114 then we have @xmath115 and also @xmath116 therefore with regard to the above energy momentum tensor @xmath86 the fields @xmath104 behave as the primary fields with conformal dimension @xmath117 respectively .",
    "the current @xmath118 has conformal dimension @xmath119 , but is not a primary field unless @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "now by and we have @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 therefore the energy - momentum tensor satisfies @xmath125 with the central charge @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "we described several features of our new generalized wick theorem for interacting fields in 2d conformal field theory and presented its extension for including fermions .",
    "though the results in examples 1 , 2 , 3 can also be derived by only using the wick theorem for free ( non - interacting ) fields , we presented them to illustrate the validity of our generalized wick theorems which may be useful for readers who want to use our formulas extensively .",
    "since their expressions are so simple , it is evident that there will be much more applications of our formulas to various non - trivial problems in 2d conformal field theory .",
