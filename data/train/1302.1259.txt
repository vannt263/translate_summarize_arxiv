    "with the advance of nanofabrication techniques , people can fabricate the nano - devices using single atoms or molecules from bottom - up approach , which leads to a new field of molecular electronics@xcite .",
    "many experiments have been performed to measure quantum transport properties of molecular devices@xcite . at the same time , people have made a lot of research efforts to understand these properties from first principles@xcite . at present stage , quantitative agreement between theoretical first principles calculations and experiment results can be reached when the system is in the steady state regime under external dc bias@xcite .",
    "besides the dc steady state problem , the question of how fast a molecular device can turn on and off is also an important issue , which attracts a lot research attention recently@xcite .",
    "this kind of question can be answered by studying the dynamic response of molecular devices by sending a step like pulse from the electrodes . for this problem , exact solution of transient current",
    "was obtained by wingreen et al@xcite in the wide - band limit using non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) .",
    "recently this solution has been extended to the regime of finite band width of electrodes@xcite . when applying this exact negf solution to molecular devices for calculation of transient current as a function of time , there is a huge computational cost that scales with @xmath4 due to the triple integral over energy , where @xmath1 is the number of time steps .",
    "in addition , there are many quasi - poles near the energy axis making the integration very difficult to converge . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical prediction of the transient dynamics of molecular devices from first principles can be addressed by numerically solving scattering wave function or non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) combined with time dependent density functional theory ( tddft)@xcite .",
    "these methods again are very time - consuming for transient current calculation although the scaling has been reduced to @xmath5 . therefore , to speed up calculation , various approximate schemes were proposed to calculate time dependent transient current of molecular devices such as wide band approximation@xcite . another approximate scheme based on exact negf solution",
    "was also proposed and applied to calculate transient current of molecular devices which is very efficient and goes beyond the wideband limit@xcite . despite of these efforts ,",
    "time - dependent calculation of transient current for molecular devices is still a challenge on the computational resources . due to the importance of molecular electronics",
    ", it is timely to overcome this problem so that realistic transient dynamics calculations can be performed on molecular devices from first principles . in this paper , we propose a linear scaling @xmath0 scheme to calculate the time dependent transient current by combining complex absorbing potential ( cap ) method with exact solution based on negf @xcite and dft theory ( negf - dft - cap ) .",
    "the cap was initially used to simulate the time - dependent evolution of wave function of finite systems in one and two dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently , cap was employed to study the transport problem of molecular device from first principles@xcite using a transmission free cap@xcite . by adding an energy independent cap in lead regions , the transport problem in a infinite open system",
    "can be reduced to that of a finite simulation region .",
    "moreover , one can obtain an effective wideband - like formula to calculate dc transport quantities such as the transmission coefficient .",
    "we note that in general ac transport properties do not assume the wideband form ( effective self - energy does not depend on the energy ) in the presence of cap .",
    "fortunately , for the step - like pulse , we are able to cast the exact negf solution for transient current into a wideband form using cap which enables us to speed up the calculation tremendously .",
    "in fact , when cap is implemented into the exact negf solution the amount of calculation scales like @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the number of time steps , @xmath7 is the dimension of the hamiltonian in the whole simulation region including the cap region , and @xmath8 is a constant of order of a few hundred . with this order @xmath1 method at hand ,",
    "the first principles calculation of transient current of realistic molecular devices are within the reach .",
    "we have applied our formalism to molecular devices and carried out the benchmark calculation for a one - dimensional atomic chain which agrees with the result from exact numerical calculation .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated transient dynamics of a 3d molecular device and calculated transient current at two different bias voltages .",
    "it was found that the transient current involves many time scales showing that the wideband limit is a bad approximation for molecular devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath9",
    ", we will first introduce the formalism of complex absorbing potential ( cap ) and briefly discuss its application in dc transport calculations .",
    "then we will discuss how to apply the cap to calculate the time dependent transient current of molecular device under upward step - like pulse .",
    "in section @xmath10 , benchmark comparisons with negf - tddft method is presented",
    ". then numerical calculation of transient current of the al - c@xmath3-al molecular device is given .",
    "finally , section @xmath11 serves as discussion and conclusion part .",
    "as shown in figure @xmath12 , a typical two terminal device consists of the central scattering region connected by two semi - infinite external leads along the transport @xmath13 direction .",

    "one is actually solving the scattering problem of the infinite dimension . in the framework of non - equilibrium",

    "the black solid lines represent the complex absorbing potential added to both lead regions .",
    "the region enclosed by red dashed line is the central region ; the purple dashed dot line encloses the central region plus complex absorbing potential region in the leads.,width=321,height=79 ]    the idea of cap method is to replace the infinite system by a finite dimension using a transparent boundary condition that absorbs the incident wave function completely . in the application of cap to the quantum transport problem",
    ", cap is added to a finite lead region ( called cap region ) outside of central scattering region . usually , the effectiveness of cap on absorbing the incident wave depends on the length of the cap region .",
    "the reduction of reflection can be improved by increasing the length of cap region in a controlled way .",
    "note that the advantage of cap method over the exact method relies on the fact that the cap does not depends on energy while the self - energy of the exact method does . using this property",
    ", the poles of green s function for cap method can be obtained easily .",
    "therefore the convergence problem of energy integral in calculating transient current is solved . in the numerical calculation",
