    "the recent proliferation of networks operating on unlicensed bands , most notably 802.11 and bluetooth , has stimulated research into the study of how different systems competing for the same spectrum interact .",
    "communication on unlicensed spectrum is desirable essentially because it is free , but users are subject to random interference generated by the transmissions of other users .",
    "most research to date has assumed devices have no natural incentive to cooperate with one another .",
    "for instance , a wireless router in one apartment is not concerned about the interference it generates in a neighboring apartment . following from this assumption ,",
    "various game - theoretic formulations have been used to model the interplay between neighboring systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion stemming from this body of work is that for single - stage games the nash equilibria ( n.e . )",
    "are typically unfavorable , resulting in inefficient allocations of resources to users .",
    "a quintessential example is the following .",
    "consider a system where a pair of competing links is subjected to white - noise and all cross - gains are frequency - flat .",
    "suppose the transmitters wish to select a one - time power allocation across frequency subject to a constraint on the total power expended ( this problem is studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where it is referred to as the _ gaussian interference game _ ) .",
    "it is straightforward to reason ( via a waterfilling argument ) that the selection by both users of frequency - flat power allocations , each occupying the entire band , constitutes a n.e .. this _ full spread _ power allocation can be extremely inefficient .",
    "consider a symmetric system where the cross - gains and direct - gains are equal . at",
    "high @xmath2 each link achieves a throughput of only 1 b / s / hz , instead of @xmath3 b / s / hz , which would be obtained if the links cooperated by occupying orthogonal halves of the spectrum . at an @xmath2 of 30 db , the throughput ratio between cooperative behavior and this full spread n.e .",
    "behavior , referred to as the _ price of anarchy _",
    ", is about 5 .",
    "this example highlights an important point in relation to single - stage games between competing wireless links : users typically have an incentive to occupy all of the available resources .    in this work",
    "a different approach is taken . rather than assuming total anarchy ,",
    "that is , competition between _ all _ wireless links , we instead assume competition only between wireless links belonging to _ different networks_. wireless links belonging to the same network are assumed to _",
    "cooperate_. in short , we assume competition on the network level , not on the link level . in a practical setting this may represent the fact that neighboring wireless systems are produced by the same manufacturer , or are administered by the same network operator .",
    "alternatively one may view the competition as being between coalitions of users @xcite .    to make the problem analytically tractable but",
    "still retain its underlying mechanics , we assume each network operates under a random - access protocol , where users from a given network access the channel independently but with the same probability .",
    "analysis of random access protocols provides intuition for the behavior of systems operating under more complex protocols , as the access probability can broadly be interpreted as the average degrees of freedom each user occupies . for the case of competition on the link level , game - theoretic research of random - access protocols such as aloha",
    "have been conducted in @xcite and @xcite . in our model",
    "each network has a different density of nodes and chooses its access probability to maximize average throughput per user .",
    "note this access protocol is essentially identical to one in which users select a random fraction of the spectrum on which to communicate .",
    "thus an access probability of one corresponds to a full spread power allocation .",
    "we first assume all links in the system have the same transmission range and afterwards show that the results are only trivially modified if each link is assumed to have an i.i.d . random transmission range .",
    "we characterize the n.e . of this system for a fixed - rate model , where all users transmit at the same data rate . we show that unlike the case of competing links , a n.e",
    ". always exists and is _",
    "unique_. furthermore for a large range of typical parameter values , the n.e . is not full spread nodes in at least one network occupy only a fraction of the bandwidth .",
    "we also identify two modes , delineated by the pathloss exponent @xmath0 . for @xmath1 , the n.e .",
    "behavior is distinctly different than for @xmath4 and possesses pseudo - cooperative properties . following this",
    "we show that the picture for the variable - rate model , in which users individually tailor their transmission rates to match the instantaneous channel capacity , remains unchanged . before concluding we present simulation results for the behavior of the system when the networks employ a greedy algorithm to optimize their throughput , operating under both a random access protocol , and a carrier sensing protocol .    in section",
    "ii we formulate the system model explicitly . in section iii.a",

    "consider two wireless networks consisting of @xmath5 and @xmath6 tx - rx pairs , respectively . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume @xmath7 .",
    "the transmitting nodes are uniformly distributed at random in an area of size @xmath8 . to avoid",
    "boundary effects suppose this area is the surface of a sphere . thus @xmath9 is the density of transmitters ( or receivers ) in network @xmath10 . for each transmitter , the corresponding receiver",
    "is initially assumed to be located at a fixed range of @xmath11 meters with uniform random bearing .",
    "time is slotted and all users are assumed to be time synchronized .",
    "both networks operate on the same band of ( presumably unlicensed ) spectrum and at each time slot a subset of tx - rx pairs are simultaneously scheduled in each network .",
    "when scheduled a tx - rx pair uses all of the spectrum .",
    "it is generally desirable to schedule neighboring tx - rx pairs in different time slots .",
    "this scheduling model is a form of tdm , but is more or less analogous to an fdm model where each tx - rx pair is allocated a subset of the spectrum ( typically overlapping in some way with other tx - rx pairs in the network ) .",
    "transmitting nodes are full buffer in that they always have data to send .",
    "transmissions are assumed to use gaussian codebooks and interference from other nodes is treated as noise .",
    "initially we analyse the model where all transmissions in network @xmath10 occur at a common rate of @xmath12 .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the _ target _ @xmath14 .",
    "thus a transmission in network @xmath10 is successful iff @xmath15 .",

    "the signal power attenuates according to a power law with _ pathloss exponent _ @xmath16 .",
    "we assume a high-@xmath2 or _ interference limited _ scenario where the thermal noise is insignificant relative to the received power of interfering nodes and thus refer to the @xmath17 as the @xmath17 . for a given realization of the node locations",
    "the time - averaged throughput achieved by the @xmath18th tx - rx pair in network @xmath10 is then @xmath19    per complex d.o.f . , where @xmath20 is the fraction of time the @xmath18th tx - rx pair is scheduled .",
    "the average ( represented by the bar above the @xmath21 ) is essentially taken over the distribution of the interference as at different times different subsets of transmitters are scheduled .    as for @xmath16",
    "the bulk of the interference is generated by the strongest interferer , to make the problem tractable , we compute the @xmath17 as the receive power of the desired signal divided by the receive power of the _ nearest _ interferers signal . we refer to this as the _ dominant interferer _ assumption .",
    "denote the range of the nearest interferer to the @xmath18th receiver at time @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24    the metric of interest to each network is its expected time - averaged rate per user , @xmath25\\ ] ]    the subscript @xmath26 indicates this expectation is taken over the geographic distribution of the nodes .",
    "as the setup is statistically symmetric , this metric is equivalent to the expected _ sum rate _ of the system , divided by @xmath27 , in the limit @xmath28 .",

    "in order to obtain better insight into the problem at hand , a change of variables is required .",
    "we refer to the set of all points within the transmission range as the _ transmission disc_. the quantity @xmath34 is the _ average number of nodes ( tx or rx ) per transmission disc_. we often refer to it simply as the _ number of nodes per disc _ and represent it by the symbol @xmath35    assume @xmath36 is larger than a certain threshold ( we make this precise later ) . maximizing over the access probability yields @xmath37    with the optimal access probability being @xmath38    one can further optimize over the target @xmath17 so that @xmath30 is replaced by @xmath39 in the above two equations . inspection of equation ( [ eqn : one_network_thpt ] ) reveals that the optimal target @xmath17 is a function of @xmath0 alone .",

    "we find that the optimal target @xmath17 is @xmath48 and the optimal number of transmissions per disc is @xmath49 , when @xmath36 is larger than a certain threshold .",
    "when @xmath36 is smaller than this threshold , there are nt enough tx - rx pairs to reach the optimal number of transmissions per disc , even when all of them are simultaneously scheduled . in this case",
    "the solution lies on the boundary with @xmath50 .",
    "this corresponds to the scenario where the transmission range is short relative to the node density such that tx - rx pairs function as if in isolation .",
    "it is intuitive that in this case all transmissions in the network will be simultaneously scheduled .",
    "our discussion is summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : op_access_prob ] ( optimal access probability ) for a single network operating in isolation under the random access protocol , when @xmath51 the optimal access probability is @xmath52 , where @xmath47 is given by the unique solution of equation ( [ eqn : lambda_star ] ) .",

    "as discussed earlier , the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 at equilibrium are equal to those of the fixed - rate game times a constant @xmath160 .",
    "the intuition behind our result is the following .",
    "the average throughput per link is essentially equal to the product of the fraction of time transmissions are scheduled , and the average number of bits successfully communicated per transmission . adjusting the transmit density has a linear effect on the former term , but a non - linear effect on the latter .",
    "the latter depends on the @xmath17 and the @xmath17 essentially depends on the pathloss exponent via @xmath161    when the nearest interferer is closer than the transmitter , the ratio inside the parentheses is less than one , and a large value of @xmath0 substantially hurts the @xmath17 , dragging it to near zero and causing the link capacity to drop to near zero . however , when the nearest interferer is further away than the transmitter , the ratio is greater than one and a large value of @xmath0 substantially improves the @xmath17 , resulting in a large link capacity .",
    "thus for large @xmath0 the average number of bits successfully communicated per transmission is very sensitive to whether or not the transmission disc is empty .",
    "this insensitivity for sufficiently small @xmath0 means that increasing the transmit density in network @xmath10 causes a linear increase in the fraction of time transmissions are scheduled , but has little effect on the number of bits successfully communicated per transmission , up until the point where the transmit density of network @xmath10 starts to dwarf the transmit density of network @xmath18 .",
    "thus network @xmath10 will wish to increase its transmit density until it is sufficiently larger than network @xmath18 s . likewise network @xmath18",
    "will wish to increase its transmit density until it is sufficiently larger than network @xmath10 s .",
    "ultimately this results in either    1 .   a full / full reuse solution , which occurs when the sparser network max s out and winds up simultaneously scheduling all of its transmissions , and the denser network is insufficiently dense such that its optimal transmit density based on the sparser networks choice , results in it simultaneously scheduling all of its transmissions , or 2 .   a full / partial reuse solution , which occurs when the sparser network max s out and winds up simultaneously scheduling all of its transmissions but the denser network is sufficiently dense such that its optimal transmit density based on the sparser networks choice , results in it simultaneously scheduling only a fraction of its transmissions .",
    "the opposite effect occurs for sufficiently large @xmath0 , where the average number of bits successfully communicated per transmission depends critically on whether or not there is an interferer inside the transmission disc . in this scenario network",
    "@xmath10 will set its active density to a level lower than network @xmath18 s , in order to capitalize on those instances in which network @xmath18 happens to not schedule any transmissions nearby to one of network @xmath10 s receivers , resulting in the successful communication of a large number of bits .",
    "likewise network @xmath18 will set its active density to a level lower than network @xmath10 s , and the system converges to the partial / partial reuse regime .",

    "this assumption essentially evoked the following approximation @xmath169    the equivalent approximation for the variable transmission range problem is @xmath170    thus for variable range transmission the dominant interferer is not necessarily the nearest to the receiver . under this assumption",
    "the @xmath17 at the @xmath18th rx node at time @xmath22 is then @xmath171    where @xmath172 is the index of the tx node that is closest to the @xmath18th receiver relative to its transmission range .",

    "ideally we would like to be able to draw this conclusion for a more sophisticated class of scheduling protocols employing carrier sensing .",
    "due to the analytical intractability of the problem , we present simulation results to illustrate this effect .",
    "we assume both networks operate under the following protocol .",
    "we present a centralized version of it due to space constraints , but claim there exists a distributed version that performs identically in most cases . during the scheduling phase , each tx - rx pair is assigned a unique token at random from @xmath212 .",
    "tx nodes proceed with their transmission so long as they will not cause excessive interference to any rx node with a higher priority token .",
    "more precisely , a transmission is scheduled so long as for each rx node with higher priority , the difference between its received signal power in db and the interference power from the lower priority tx node in db , exceeds a silencing threshold @xmath213 ( @xmath214 for network 1 and @xmath215 for network 2 ) .",
    "thus a game between the two networks can be defined where the strategies are the choices of silencing thresholds @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of two wireless networks operating on the same ( presumably unlicensed ) frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> pairs within a given network cooperate to schedule transmissions , but between networks there is competition for spectrum . to make the problem tractable , </S>",
    "<S> we assume transmissions are scheduled according to a random access protocol where each network chooses an access probability for its users . a game between the two networks is defined . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the nash equilibrium behavior of the system . </S>",
    "<S> three regimes are identified ; one in which both networks simultaneously schedule all transmissions ; one in which the denser network schedules all transmissions and the sparser only schedules a fraction ; and one in which both networks schedule only a fraction of their transmissions . the regime of operation depends on the pathloss exponent @xmath0 , the latter regime being desirable , but attainable only for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that in certain environments , rival wireless networks may end up naturally cooperating . to substantiate our analytical results , we simulate a system where networks iteratively optimize their access probabilities in a greedy manner . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a distributed scheduling protocol that employs carrier sensing , and demonstrate via simulations , that again a near cooperative equilibrium exists for sufficiently large @xmath0 . </S>"
