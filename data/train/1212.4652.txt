    "the recent discovery of a resonance by both the atlas  @xcite and the cms  @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has led to intense activity .",
    "this has been accentuated by the fact that initially both the groups reported excesses  over the standard model ( sm ) backgrounds  in multiple channels and concentrated at nearly the same ( 125126 gev ) reconstructed mass .",
    "supported by evidence from the tevatron  @xcite , this has naturally led to euphoria in the community . however , even though the resonance is obviously a boson , its identification with the long - awaited higgs particle of the standard electroweak theory is not yet certain .    while the observed diphoton decay mode excludes the possibility of the said resonance being a spin-1 particle , other non - trivial assignments are , as yet , possible .",
    "this is notwithstanding the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite where the pure scalar hypothesis is found to be favoured over the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis for the said resonance . furthermore ,",
    "even if the said assignment is proven , that still does not uniquely identify the observed particle to be _ the _ sm higgs boson , there is still enough room for new physics ( np ) resulting in modified higgs couplings with the sm particles .",
    "for one , the diphoton ( the channel permitting the cleanest measurement of the mass ) rate was significantly above the expectations even in late 2012 , and is not yet in full conformity with the sm .",
    "while these are yet early days to claim a discrepancy , the observed patterns have led to intense speculations about the nature of this particle and the ramifications of this discovery for a host of scenarios of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm )  @xcite . at this juncture",
    ", it must be recognised that the purported discrepancies , if any , could just be a manifestation of the inherent uncertainties in qcd calculations , both in the perturbative and the non - perturbative regimes  @xcite . on the other hand , ratios of signal rates ( such as that between the diphoton and the four - lepton final states ) are relatively free of such uncertainties and constitute a more robust signature of a deviation from the sm expectations  @xcite .",
    "a framework for this has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the scale factors @xmath3 , parametrizing the deviation of higgs decay width or production cross section , were defined ; the production cross section @xmath4 for @xmath5 or the decay width @xmath6 for @xmath7 has an extra multiplicative scale factor @xmath8 when compared with the sm predictions .    in view of the state of affairs ( compounded by the fact that no other distinct departure from the sm has been observed at the lhc ) , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite effected an interesting phenomenological study .",
    "considering all of the higgs couplings , whether tree - level or loop - induced , to be unrelated and free parameters , as well as allowing for an invisible decay mode for the higgs , they used the observations ( both low - energy , such as precision electroweak observables , as well as the recent data ) to obtain a best fit to the same . in as much as no underlying physics assumptions ( other than lorentz invariance ) were made for this sector ( _ i.e. _ ,",
    "no patterns were imposed on the anomalous couplings of the higgs , whether to the gauge bosons or to the fermions ) , this constitutes , perhaps , the most general investigation to the possible nature of physics just beyond the sm scale .",
    "one might parametrize the higgs effective coupling to @xmath0 and gauge bosons to be ^eff= e^ig_t h|tt + g_w h w_^+ w^- + g_z h z_z^ , [ biswa_effective ] where @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs . within the sm , @xmath10 and @xmath11 all equal unity . allowing these couplings ( as also others , which are not germane to the discussions here ) to vary independently , ref .",

    "+ [ biswa_best_fit ] the fits f1 and f2 were performed holding @xmath12 to be real .",
    "similarly , f2 and f3 demanded custodial symmetry .",
    "the constraint on custodial symmetry breaking , given by the oblique parameter @xmath13 , is so strong that it is natural to impose @xmath14 .",
    "note that for these points , all the other parameters were held at their best fit values respectively and not at the sm values .",
    "one must , however , be aware of the fact that the rapid influx of data makes the best fit points vulnerable to change even over a very short period of time , and analyses based on the latest data present in moriond 2013 are now available in the literature @xcite .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath15 and @xmath16 , assuming the custodial symmetry and using all higgs production and decay data along with electroweak precision observables ; whereas not imposing this symmetry leads to  @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that while our benchmark points f1f3 may no longer remain the best fit values , they are still within the 95% allowed range .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the internal disagreements between the various data sets can not yet be wished away and the accumulation of further data can swing the pendulum either way .",
    "furthermore , the deviations allowed for by even the moriond data are quite significant .",
    "in particular , the top quark yukawa coupling still has a very large uncertainty and can potentially be negative .",
    "in fact , such a negative coupling , and consequently a constructive interference between the top - mediated and the @xmath19-mediated triangle diagrams ( in place of a destructive interference as in the sm ) , was touted to be a plausible way out from the apparent excess in @xmath20 in july 2012 data .",
    "the effects of such anomalous top yukawa coupling already received attention much before the discovery of the higgs boson , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the context of baryogenesis @xcite or unitarity violation in gauge boson scattering @xcite .",
    "the latter will be particularly relevant for our subsequent discussion .    as the exact nature of the `` best fit ''",
    "would again change once more data is included in the fit , we do not consider the cases of eq .",
    "( [ biswa_best_fit ] ) , or even the later values , to be sacrosanct , but treat them only as indicative of such fits .",
    "it is worth noting that once custodial symmetry is imposed , the deviations from the sm , viz .",
    "@xmath21 are much smaller than @xmath22 ( this also holds , albeit weakly , for f1 ) .",
    "although still larger than what naive dimensional analysis would suggest ( for a new physics scale @xmath23 gev ) , such @xmath24 could , presumably , be the result of quantum corrections ( possibly , though , in a theory that is either strongly coupled or has a non - trivial ultraviolet completion ) .",
    "the large change of @xmath22 is , however , a more complicated story and constitutes the bulk of this paper .",
    "one notes that such a change is also indicated in atlas and cms analyses @xcite based on their data and the formalism developed in ref .",
    "taking @xmath25 and @xmath14 ( so that the custodial symmetry is respected ) , the atlas collaboration found , within 68% confidence limit , g_t ,   g_w .",
    "the cms collaboration , on the other hand , found the best fit at @xmath26 .",
    "however , each of the two collaborations analysed only their own data set , and also did not consider the possibility that the higgs could decay into any new particles .",
    "thus , the fit in @xcite encompasses a wider amount of data . with this caveat ,",
    "it is easy to appreciate the relatively minor differences in the fits .    while the process of pinning down the various couplings of the higgs continues as data pour in , it is also necessary to subject our observations to theoretical consistency checks .",
    "for example , one important role of the higgs boson is to ensure partial wave unitarity in various @xmath27 scattering processes .",
    "the role of longitudinal @xmath28 scattering , for example , in unveiling possible new physics in anomalous gauge self - interaction , even in the absence of any well - defined resonance , has been discussed in ref .",
    "if the couplings of the higgs turn out to have non - standard values , then the fine balance required for unitarity is destroyed , and one has to set a cut - off scale for the theory  @xcite . in this work , we derive values of this cut - off scale for various levels of departure of the higgs - fermion - antifermion interactions from their standard values .",
    "side by side , we also examine the implications of such modified interaction strengths on the issue of vacuum stability ( essentially arising from the radiatively corrected quartic coupling potentially turning negative ) . and , based on the above considerations",
    ", we make some remarks on how the existence of additional particles can restore balance to the whole scenario , if indeed the recently observed scalar has anomalous coupling strengths .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "theory ] , we discuss some theoretical issues pertaining to the choice of these best - fit points ; in particular , we would like to spend some time on the point f3 , which includes a nontrivial phase in the top yukawa coupling . in section",
    "[ sec : unitarity ] , we discuss the unitarity of @xmath29 and @xmath30 scattering with such benchmark points .",
    "the evolution of the scalar quartic coupling is discussed in section [ sec : rge ] .",
    "while we do not go into details about models that can produce such effective couplings , some relevant remarks are made in section [ sec : avenue ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in the section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "some calculational details as well as a compendium of necessary formulae are put in the appendices .",
    "let us first make a few comments on the point f3 , where a complex top yukawa coupling is indicated .",
    "this immediately raises very pertinent and interesting questions as to the possible sources of such an anomalous coupling . while mixing effects",
    "( whether in the higgs sector or in the fermion sector ) can and do cause significant deviations in the coupling , the magnitude of the deviation is never so large unless the new states are both very light and have complicated quantum number assignments .",
    "similarly , such a large anomalous coupling is not expected from loop - corrections ( owing to some as - yet - unobserved states ) unless the said sector couples very strongly to the observed one of f2 . ] . in particular , the existence of a non - zero @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) ostensibly renders the hamiltonian to be non - hermitian .",
    "although this , at the first glance , would seem to lead to non - unitary time evolution , it has been shown that field theories based on a non - unitary lagrangian  @xcite could accommodate a unitary @xmath32-matrix .",
    "this , however , requires a redefinition of the metric in the hilbert space , and with such a modified metric , the @xmath32-matrix is unitary if _ all stable particles _ have a positive - definite norm . such a redefinition",
    ", however , requires that propagators and feynman diagrams ( indeed , the entire perturbation theory ) be redefined adequately  @xcite .",
    "this introduces a whole new panoply of problems , such as those dealing with electroweak precision measurements as well as classic tests of quantum electrodynamics such as the lamb shift or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron ( and , its cousin , the muon ) .",
    "this seems to be too big a price to pay and we shall , hence , turn our attention to simpler alternatives .    as is well - known , such an absorptive part can arise from loop - corrections within a hermitian theory if there exists an intermediate state that can be on - shell .",
    "however , the existence of such a state begs many questions . for one ,",
    "such particles would necessarily be light and should have manifested themselves not only in higgs decays , but also in other collider processes .",
    "this is particularly so , for , by definition , such a state would be part of an @xmath33 doublet , which , in turn , would immediately call for similar contributions to the absorptive parts of other effective vertices ( with or without the higgs ) .",
    "not only this , such a light state should have been produced directly too .",
    "in particular , the @xmath33 antecedents would have required that they be produced at a clean environment such as lep - ii ( as also the tevatron ) .",
    "no signs of either such production , or the inducing of absorptive parts in other couplings have yet been observed .",
    "similarly , one can not ascribe this phase due to say , an exchange of an unknown ( set of ) particle in the `` @xmath34-channel '' of a loop with the on - shell particles being some light sm state such as the @xmath35 .",
    "although a phase can appear in such a case , it actually encapsulates the final state rescattering of the said light particles ( i.e. @xmath36 , with @xmath37 rescattering , in howsoever complicated a fashion , to the final state of interest , viz .",
    "@xmath38 ) , and has little to do with an effective @xmath39 vertex .    furthermore",
    ", the very act of calculating loops with such an ansatz for the origin of the phase ( as attempted in the literature ) is fraught with danger .",
    "an effective theory can be obtained ( starting from an ultraviolet completion ) only on integrating out fields more massive than the scale at which the effective theory is being utilized . by its very definition , then , the light fields that ostensibly led to the phase can not be integrated out and must be included in all loop corrections , whether for the higgs production and/or decay , or for processes involving other particles , such as the @xmath40 .",
    "such inclusion will , naturally , lead not only to significant changes in such observables , but , most often , tend to cancel the effect of the phase ( seeing that it is absent in the complete theory and was but an artefact of a perturbative calculation ) .",
    "it should also be realized that , for @xmath41 , the top quark lines at this vertex can not be on the positive energy mass - shell .",
    "thus , the application of cutkowsky rules is not straightforward ; nor is the identification of @xmath31 with the discontinuity across a cut arising from a physical region singularity . in other words , the existence of a non - zero @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) can not be motivated from any simple physics .",
    "indeed , such non - hermiticity is a subtle issue in quantum field theory  @xcite , and even if such a phase were to occur due to some hidden sector exchanges , we can not include it in an effective lagrangian ( which is a must for any loop calculations ) in any straightforward manner . we shall , henceforth , consider the top yukawa coupling to be real , albeit admitting the possibility of an anomalous component to it .",
    "thus , our benchmark point f3 will be parametrized by @xmath42 .",
    "note that this does not invalidate ref .",
    "@xcite , for when they hold @xmath43 , they still find that the best fit requires @xmath44 with the deviation from the sm being substantial to be rather unwarranted , given that the @xmath45-distribution is very flat for @xmath46 ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that a nonzero phase had been introduced earlier in the top yukawa coupling , albeit in a different context  @xcite . wishing to incorporate cp violation in this interaction ( motivated by a desire to address baryogenesis ) , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite augmented the sm lagrangian by an effective operator of the form = c _",
    "e^i |q_l t_r + h.c where @xmath47 denotes a ( real ) effective coupling owing its origin to higher - dimension terms . in the unitary gauge , this yields c _ |t t h over and above the sm term .",
    "clearly , a non - zero @xmath48 leads to cp violation .",
    "this coupling , though , is markedly different from the ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite , as it emanates from an hermitian effective lagrangian unlike in the other case .",
    "furthermore , the pseudoscalar term ( which , essentially , is the only one to see a non - zero value of the phase @xmath48 ) in the coupling above contributes only incoherently to @xmath49 and is , thus , of little consequence ( at least within the effective theory paradigm ) .    an anomalous top yukawa coupling ( even if real ) brings in its own complications . within the sm ,",
    "all couplings are dictated by gauge invariance .",
    "while deviations are indeed possible once one enlarges the ambit of the theory , gauge invariance would require that these either be associated with higher - dimensional effective operators , or be the consequence of mixings between states ( were new states to be admitted ) .",
    "each of these eventualities would imply correlated deviations in other couplings , and , on occasions , the introduction of new ones . any uncorrelated deviation , such as that of eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) can only be the result of an additional term in the lagrangian of the form _",
    "l + l_anom _ anom = ( g_t -1 ) h|tt [ our_effective ] where , for simplicity , we have chosen @xmath50 .",
    "such a term , of course , explicitly breaks @xmath51 . while its inclusion may seem to militate against the gauge dogma , note that eq .",
    "( [ our_effective ] ) could just represent the relevant part of the bsm physics , with other terms being hidden for unknown reasons .",
    "thus , the breaking of gauge invariance might be an artefact of restricting ourselves to be close to the augmented sm , which acts only as a low - energy effective theory , while gauge invariance is again restored when we go to the full theory at a high energy . in the effective theory , due to the apparent loss of gauge invariance ,",
    "the mass and the yukawa coupling of the fermions , in particular the top quark , get decoupled , and this apparent loss has other profound implications .",
    "as is well known , unitarity in gauge boson scattering ( in particular , the longitudinal modes ) is inextricably linked to gauge invariance . while any loss of unitarity due to @xmath52 could , in principle , be restored on inclusion of other terms in @xmath53 , the scale at which such a loss is seen ( if one considers @xmath54 alone ) would point to the scale of the new theory that underlies such a deviation .",
    "similarly , the existence of @xmath54 would have non - trivial consequences for the renormalization group evolution of the couplings in the theory as well for considerations such as the stability of the vacuum .",
    "in a phenomenological study of the higgs boson , while all its couplings could be varied independently  @xcite , it makes sense to concentrate on the dominant ones . within the sm ,",
    "these are the ones with the top quark and the weak gauge bosons . maintaining the lorentz structures to be identical to those within the sm",
    ", these can be parametrized as in eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) , but categorically with @xmath50 .",
    "clearly the effective lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) would have non - trivial effects on a host of scattering processes , notably on @xmath56 where @xmath57 . as is well - known",
    ", partial wave unitarity for such scattering processes depends crucially on the couplings being those mandated by @xmath51 invariance alongwith renormalizability .",
    "thus , @xmath58 could , in principle destroy the same for , say , @xmath59 .",
    "this particular scattering proceeds through a set of seven feynman diagrams , namely a four - point contact interaction , two @xmath60-channel diagrams mediated by the @xmath61 and the @xmath40 ( or , in the unbroken symmetry phase , by the @xmath62 ) , two analogous @xmath34-channel ones and , finally , one each of @xmath60 and @xmath34channel higgs - mediated diagrams . with the trilinear ( quartic )",
    "gauge boson vertices scaling as @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) where @xmath65 is a typical momentum transfer , and the polarization vector for the longitudinal vector boson going ( for large @xmath65 ) as @xmath66 , it is obvious that each of the individual pure - gauge diagram contributions to the amplitude goes as @xmath67 .",
    "the gauge theory antecedents of the vector - boson self - couplings ensure that the leading terms cancel identically leaving behind a @xmath68 behaviour . once the higgs - mediated diagrams are included ,",
    "even the @xmath69 contributions cancel , and on integrating the remaining terms over the phase space , one obtains a cross section in consonance with the froissart bound - channel results in a collinear singularity , this does not violate the froissart bound .",
    "indeed , this singularity disappears ( as it should ) when higher order corrections are taken into account . ] .",
    "clearly , this cancellation is contingent upon the higgs couplings being just so , and allowing for @xmath70 would result in additional @xmath71 contributions from the higgs - mediated diagram to the amplitude resulting in a bad high - energy behaviour .     as a function of the cm energy , on imposition of a cut @xmath72 on the scattering angle .",
    "the left ( right ) panels refer to unpolarized and @xmath73 scattering respectively .",
    "the individual curves refer to different values of the @xmath74 coupling @xmath75 as normalized to the sm value ( see eq .  [ biswa_effective]).__,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   as a function of the cm energy , on imposition of a cut @xmath72 on the scattering angle .",

    "[ fig:4w ] , we show the consequent behaviour of the cross sections for a few representative values of @xmath75 . note that even for small values of @xmath76 that are allowed at present , the cross section grows anomalously and hence it is easy to ascertain that such a theory loses unitarity at a few tevs at best ( corresponding to best fit with custodial symmetry @xcite ) , but also for @xmath77 ( best fit without custodial symmetry @xcite ) . ] and a new theory needs to be around , and , by implication , _ within the reach of the lhc_.    it might be argued , though , that such a deviation in @xmath75 could well be accompanied by others in the gauge boson self couplings , evoking memories of a non - linearly realized symmetry , or at the very least , higher - dimensional terms in an electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "while it seems plausible that such correlated deviations could preserve unitarity , it can be seen that simultaneous restoration in all possible channels is difficult to achieve within the ambit of phenomenologically acceptable deviations @xcite .",
    "however , even if this were to be possible , constraints appear from another sector that we now turn to .",
    "this is of particular importance as the deviations @xmath78 in the fits f2 and f3 are relatively small and could shrink further once more data is taken into account .",
    "as already mentioned , of the sm particles , the higgs couples with an unsuppressed strength only to the weak gauge bosons and the top .",
    "we have already discussed the consequences of deviations to the former and , now , concentrate on the latter . in analogy to the discussion in the preceding section , this coupling plays a crucial role in processes such as @xmath80 , to which the following diagrams contribute :        as can be ascertained from arguments mirroring those in the preceding section , the amplitude that grows most strongly with energy pertains to @xmath81 annihilation to @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the higgs diagram contribution goes as @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "if the coupling @xmath12 deviates from the sm value , the cancellation of the leading term with the non - higgs diagrams would be imperfect and the amplitude would grow with energy , thereby violating the froissart bound at some scale . while it may be argued that it is only the combination @xmath85 that comes into play , note that the @xmath86 needed for the fits can neither compensate for the required @xmath22 nor is such a large deviation consistent with @xmath28 scattering . similarly , large deviations in the @xmath87 vertex can be ruled out from the measurements of single - top production at the tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite , as well as from b physics observables such as the mass difference of neutral b meson eigenstates .",
    "this study is best done in terms of the partial wave amplitudes defined as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the lorentz invariant amplitude , @xmath90 is the scattering angle and @xmath91 the legendre functions .",

    "the collinear singularity that appears in the large-@xmath105 limit  attested to by the logarithmic term  is identical to that within the sm and disappears once higher order corrections are taken into account .",

    "furthermore , the particular values chosen for the anomalous couplings were dictated by the ` best fits ' corresponding to a set of data that might soon be overwhelmed by new data . in view of this",

    "this shows that the electroweak vacuum might get unstable if @xmath124 is even slightly greater than unity , and the point where the instability sets in depends rather sensitively on @xmath124 . for example , the vacuum becomes unstable at an energy as low as about @xmath125 gev for @xmath126 . at the one - loop level ,",
    "the negative term proportional to @xmath127 , coming from a top - mediated box diagram , is responsible for this .",
    "thus , both f2 and f3 would indicate the presence of new physics @xmath128 gev on this account ( the unitarity bounds are stronger , though ) , while f1 seems to be safe . while these shifts parallel those engendered by the errors on the top quark mass measurement itself , there are subtle differences .",
    "for one , the shift in @xmath124 that the fittings favour are much larger than the experimental errors in @xmath123 ( @xmath129@xmath130 according to various estimates ) . moreover , the deployment of the matching conditions in the two cases would differ .    at the same time",
    ", we must be cautious about taking these numbers too literally .",
    "the calculations hold only if the new physics responsible for the change in the top yukawa coupling is either above the scale where instability sets in ( so that those new degrees of freedom are still frozen ) , or the effective interaction involves only sm fields but with a new operator structure . in particular , the apparent consistency of f1 can not be depended on , once the physics responsible for unitarity violation is turned on .",
    "while we have delineated the problems that beset an effective theory wherein the coupling of the recently glimpsed higgs - like resonance to the top quark , the @xmath19 and the @xmath40 are reset from the sm values to those obtained from phenomenological best fits , we have not indicated any source for the same . for example , the generation of a large ( but real ) anomalous coupling to be the result of either large quantum corrections or mixings with as yet undetected states .",
    "the latter possibility would , of course , require such states to be relatively low - lying , and in fact not too separated from the corresponding known sm states . were it indeed to be so , all arguments about unitarity or triviality would necessarily need to be revised .",
    "since an exhaustive treatment is not possible owing to the paucity of independent data , as well as the enormity of the task , we examine some simple alternatives . viewed differently , while the arguments in the previous sections point to the _ necessity _ of having a relatively low cutoff , we now consider some possible realizations of the same .",
    "before we delve into the specifics , let us consider some generic issues .",
    "* it might be argued that a negative @xmath12 would necessitate the existence of a second source of electroweak symmetry breaking and that this would imply relatively light new states .",
    "however , a close examination of the same shows that while the first part of the argument does hold , the second depends on implicit assumptions about the new sector .",
    "for example , one could well admit a second higgs doublet or a strongly interacting sector ( such as topcolor ) , perhaps coupling only to the top quark .",
    "at the cost of some fine tuning ( or introduction of additional symmetries , analogous but not identical to those in little higgs models ) , one could easily raise the mass scale for the new particles to a few tevs .",
    "what the preceding arguments do show , however , that , independent of the fine tuning , this scale has to be lower than @xmath131 tev . *",
    "the introduction of any such ultraviolet completion would have an impact on the running of the higgs quartic couplings .",
    "this is irrespective of whether this new sector couples to the sm higgs at the tree level .",
    "this would , presumably , cure the potential problem with vacuum stability . however , unless the entire theory is known , an accurate computation of this effect is not possible , and we will not attempt to do so .      to begin with , let us consider the effect of @xmath132 . while unequal values for @xmath75 and @xmath11 do violate custodial symmetry , the most visible consequences appear in electroweak precision observables and can be neutralized by arranging for compensating custodial breaking in other sectors of the theory .",
    "indeed , this has been included in the fitting of ref .",
    "@xcite . as for the unitarity violation in gauge boson scattering , curing it would require the introduction of additional contributions to the amplitude .",
    "the simplest possibility would be to postulate the existence of another scalar , say @xmath133 , whose couplings parallel those of @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) , but with the corresponding couplings being @xmath135 , viz .",
    "g_w g_w , g_z g_z .",
    "assuming that this new scalar has a mass @xmath136 , the restoration of unitarity for @xmath137 would require that g_w^2 + g_w^2 = 1  , g_z^2 + g_z^2 = 1  , g_w g_z + g_w g_z = 1  , [ restoration_1 ] with the three constraints emanating from considerations of @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( and crossed processes ) respectively . while the requirements might seem trivial at first sight , note that these are actually three conditions on two variables . moreover , the `` best fit points '' and , indeed , most of the good fit part of the parameter space found in @xcite requires @xmath141 , thereby necessitating negative @xmath142 .",
    "while this roadblock could be circumvented by postulating a wrong sign for the scalar kinetic term , such a solution brings along its own problems .",
    "note , though , that this would still not guarantee the existence of a simultaneous solution to all three of the above constraints",
    ". however , the extent of unitarity violation could be minimized so as to push the scale of violation significantly higher .",
    "the situation simplifies considerably if the scalar @xmath133 is not an _ ad hoc _ degree of freedom , but part of another higgs multiplet that contributes to electroweak symmetry breaking . while only certain representations would guarantee @xmath143 at the tree - level , it is possible , in principle , to arrange multiple vacuum expectation values for a multitude of representations and carefully tune them to maintain this relation @xcite .",
    "obtaining effective @xmath144 for at least one such scalar ( to be identified with the observed resonance ) requires that at least one of these representations must be higher than a doublet @xcite . typically , though",
    ", @xmath145 would not be maintained .",
    "it should be realized that , now , it is not just one new scalar that we would have , but an entire multiplet .",
    "this , of course , would change eqs.([restoration_1 ] ) to include additional terms , thereby making it easier to satisfy all three conditions .",
    "( this is despite the fact that gauge symmetry would relate several of the new couplings . )",
    "the behaviour of the potentially offending cross sections ( equivalently , the partial wave amplitudes ) would change too ; interim phases of growth with @xmath105 would be seen , especially as a new higgs threshold is approached . for very large @xmath105",
    "though , the froissart bound would be seen to be validated .",
    "yet another way to obtain @xmath146 is to postulate a new scalar with non - standard kinetic terms for at least one of the two ( the new scalar and @xmath134 ) such that significant kinetic mixing occurs .",
    "an example of this is afforded by the radion in warped models  @xcite .    from scalars ,",
    "we turn our attention to vector bosons as restorers .",
    "unitarizing gauge boson scattering in higgs - less models through the introduction of new vector bosons has been investigated in refs .",
    "clearly , the couplings must satisfy certain conditions . in the presence of a higgs ( albeit with altered couplings ) , the relations of ref .",
    "@xcite have to be altered suitably .",
    "the required changes are straightforward , at least as far as the scattering of the sm gauge bosons is concerned .",
    "it must be noted , though , that the introduction of such vector bosons introduces the possibility of a pair of them emanating from , say , @xmath81 annihilation .",
    "the latter scattering would be associated with its own unitarity violation problems , and , just as in the case of the higgs - less models , one would have to introduce a tower of such gauge bosons .",
    "the tower , in principle , is an infinite one and can be truncated only at the cost of admitting unitarity violation at some scale ( or , equivalently , appealing to some ultraviolet completion ) .",
    "similarly , all the trilinear ( and quartic ) couplings between this set of vector bosons must satisfy sum rules , the character of which will depend on whether they couple to @xmath133 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that this role of unitarity restoration is not restricted to only scalars and vector bosons , but can also be assumed by higher - spin bosons .",
    "the inclusion of the latter , though , brings a whole new set of problems to the table , and we desist from any discussion of the same",
    ".      the introduction of a new scalar @xmath133 could , in principle , restore unitarity for such processes . once again , denoting the coupling of @xmath133 to a @xmath82 pair through a form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ biswa_effective ] ) , but with @xmath147 , we can express the conditions for unitarity restoration as g_t g_w + g_t g_w = 1  , g_t g_z + g_t g_z = 1  .",
    "as before , we are faced with the problem of simultaneous solution of both these constraints , especially once @xmath148 are determined from considerations of gauge boson scattering ( see preceding section ) . of course , with the amplitude here growing only as @xmath149 , a lack of cancellation can be accommodated to a relatively larger degree , yet postponing unitarity violation to @xmath150 tev , or even later .",
    "the main problem , though , is that the best fit requires @xmath151 .",
    "this , of course , entails having @xmath152 , or , in other words , rather large couplings for the @xmath133 .",
    "of particular importance is the fact that the inclusion of scalars in larger representations of @xmath153 ( and ascribing vacuum expectation values to them ) as in the preceding section , not only does not help , but actually worsens the situation .",
    "the reason is easy to see .",
    "as such large representations would not couple to the top quark ( barring non - renormalizable terms ) , if the wavefunction of the observed resonance were to carry a significant fraction of such a state , its coupling to the top would actually be reduced from the sm value .",
    "this , of course , goes against current observations .",
    "thus , one is left with the problem of arranging a large @xmath154 . within the ambit of a phenomenological lagrangian ,",
    "this is admissible and can be arranged by invoking a suitably large yukawa coupling ( renormalizable if the extra higgs field is a doublet , and nonrenormalizable otherwise ) .",
    "however , note , that such a yukawa coupling would grow rapidly with energy and one would be faced with a landau pole .",
    "an alternative could be to consider new fermions or gauge bosons which may not couple to our familiar higgs doublet .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this does not help as long as the latter behave canonically .    to summarise , the introduction of a new ( set of ) scalars with carefully constructed couplings seems to offer the simplest solution to the conundrum . a strictly phenomenological approach , on the other hand , would be given by ascribing form factor behaviour to the deviations .",
    "for example , consider the replacement @xmath155 this , clearly would restore unitarity at large energies .",
    "this has the further advantage that this permits an examination of the behaviour of the coupling at different energies , thereby permitting some insight into the structure of the deviation once more data is available .",
    "of course , a more generic form factor can be used instead , even correcting for the lack of gauge invariance that the simple - minded expression above entails .",
    "this , though , takes us to the regime of electroweak chiral lagrangians and we shall not delve into it any further .",
    "assuming that the higgs couplings to the sm fields are arbitrary but consistent with general principles like lorentz invariance and hermiticity , we tried to see whether the present data gives any hint of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "a particularly sensitive probe is offered by considerations of unitarity in gauge boson scattering .",
    "we have considered several such scattering amplitudes , for polarized as well as unpolarized gauge bosons , and partial wave unitarity is seen to break down at about @xmath156 tev for coupling values preferred by the fits .",
    "even if this can be prevented by restoring the @xmath157 and @xmath158 vertices to their sm values ( especially since the best fits , anyway , call for only small deviations ) , we are still faced two rather interesting issues .",
    "indeed , the most important parameter in the study is the top quark yukawa coupling , which might even have a sign opposite to that of the sm prediction . because of the apparent excess of higgs to diphoton decay rate .",
    "we explored the consequences of such a wrong - sign coupling .",
    "there are two places where the wrong - sign yukawa coupling can play havoc .",
    "the first is the unitarity in gauge boson annihilation to a @xmath82 pair .",
    "this effect can be traced to a term in the scattering amplitude which is proportional to the product of the top quark yukawa coupling and the @xmath159 coupling . with the sign flip of this term ,",
    "the amplitudes grow up instead of going down and one sees unitarity violation at @xmath160 tev .",
    "thus , this indicates some new physics which takes over at a few tev scale and restores unitarity as well as gauge invariance , which is apparently broken by eq .",
    "( [ our_effective ] ) .",
    "the second place is the stability of the electroweak vacuum .",
    "the higgs quartic coupling @xmath120 becomes negative if the magnitude of the top yukawa coupling increases even a little from its sm value ( only @xmath161 is important here , and not the sign of @xmath12 ) .",
    "the point where the vacuum becomes unstable is a sensitive function of @xmath12 , but for our benchmark points , occur between 1 and 10 tev , a region already indicated by the unitarity violation . again , this asks for some new degrees of freedom , which couple to the higgs and make the vacuum stable ( so these should better be bosonic in nature ) .",
    "of course , whether the cutoff of the theory is at the planck scale or at a few tevs does not affect the @xmath162 rate as this must always be finite .",
    "it might be argued that the departures from standard couplings as suggested by the data are based on _ global analyses _ , where other couplings are simultaneously assuming non - standard values .",
    "this could be construed to mean that a complete analysis will have to take into account the role of the other modified couplings in the evolution of @xmath120 as well as in ensuring unitarity in scattering phenomena .",
    "while , as a principle , this is certainly true , note that our analysis has included all of the relevant dimension-4 terms that can be written down in terms of the sm fields alone .",
    "although the inclusion of subdominant terms would alter the quantitative details of our conclusions , no qualitative change would be brought about .",
    "thus , if the initial trend  in particular the excess in diphoton channel  persists in the new data , this might lead to some indirect evidence of new physics which is lurking close .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider the possibility that the accumulation of further luminosity would reduce the discrepancy between the data and the sm expectations , without completely obliterating it .",
    "were this to be the case , one would still need small but non - zero values for one or more anomalous couplings",
    ". a direct measurement of such small changes in the effective couplings would be well - nigh impossible , especially in the lhc environment .",
    "pending future experiments , considerations of unitarity and vacuum instability would then consist of the best `` evidence '' for a relatively low - lying threshold .",
    "however , if the effective couplings shift by less than 10% of their sm values , the minimum required scale for new physics would rise to @xmath163 tev .    recently , both atlas and cms have updated their results for higgs search at @xmath164 tev .",
    "these include not only those for the channels that form the core of our analysis , namely @xmath165  @xcite , @xmath166  @xcite and @xmath167  @xcite , but also for others such as @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "based on these , it has been variously claimed that the observations are almost perfectly in consonance with the sm expectations .",
    "however , a careful examination betrays a persisting lack of consistency between the various measurements .",
    "the large variations in the data , alongwith the data in @xmath36  @xcite as well as @xmath169  @xcite has led to subsequent fits  @xcite . although these are in the spirit of earlier fits  @xcite , the incorporation of new data has led to a shift in the best fit values for the couplings somewhat away from those of ref .",
    "notwithstanding these changes , the most important message is that the values for @xmath170 can yet be far away from those within the sm . in particular , @xmath12 can be substantially different from unity  @xcite ( with the central issue of this paper still remaining a concern ) .",
    "it should be appreciated , though , that these are yet early days of higgs physics and the central values may yet shift !    _ note added .",

    "<S> the initial data on the production and decay of the higgs boson reported significant deviations from the standard model ( sm ) expectations , prompting much speculation about its couplings to the other particles . although the latest data has veered towards conformity with the sm , there is yet room for a sizable deviation from the sm values of the coupling of the higgs boson with @xmath0 , and to a smaller extent , of that with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . keeping the fluid nature of the data in mind , </S>",
    "<S> this opens up an interesting avenue to explore regarding unitarity of gauge boson scattering and the stability of the electroweak vacuum in the presence of anomalous couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for some typical benchmark points , unitarity in gauge boson scattering breaks down between 1 and 10 tev . we also show that if there are no new light degrees of freedom , the higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at around the same point , making the electroweak vacuum unstable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , some new ultraviolet completing new physics is demanded at that scale to cancel both these anomalous behaviours if such deviations from the sm couplings are indeed established . </S>"
