    "hard spheres are often used as a model system to study the liquid to crystal transition .",
    "already more than fifty years ago the existence of the freezing transition in hard spheres has been shown by computer simulation methods @xcite .",
    "as the interaction potential between two hard spheres is infinite when they overlap and zero otherwise , the phase behaviour is determined only by entropy rather than by a competition between enthalpy and entropy .",
    "the simple interaction potential makes hard spheres a particularly popular model system for computer simulation studies of crystallization and the competing glass transition ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    hard sphere  like systems can also be realized experimentally in colloidal suspensions since the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "using scattering techniques as well as microscopy , the crystallization process and the competing glass transition have been studied in detail during the past decade ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the recent interest in studying the crystallization process of hard spheres using computer simulation has been triggered in particular by the following reasons :    crystal nucleation from a supersaturated liquid is a typical `` rare event '' .",
    "it occurs ( by definition ) after an induction time that is much longer than the time - scale for thermalization of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system , and it changes the properties of the system drastically .",
    "computer simulation of rare events requires special techniques in order to avoid wasting large amounts of cpu time on irrelevant microscopic fluctuations . for",
    "the past decade crystal nucleation has been commonly used as an example problem to apply rare event sampling techniques . however , in the mean - time computers have become fast enough to sample crystal nucleation by `` brute force '' simulation in simple model systems , such as hard spheres .",
    "hence hard spheres have recently been used to test the predictions of rare event sampling techniques ( such as e.g.  results obtained by umbrella sampling @xcite ) and to compare nucleation pathways directly to experiment @xcite .",
    "new experiments as well as simulations show deviations from the classical picture of crystallization , indicating that crystallization in hard sphere systems starts with the formation of precursors ( low symmetry clusters , medium range ordered crystals ) before real crystal are formed @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been made studying crystal nucleation in atomic systems using dynamical density functional theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was suggested that these precursors are linked with structural and dynamical heterogeneities of the meta - stable melt and that the formation of precursors might be linked with the glass transition @xcite .",
    "hence the topic of crystallization in hard spheres is currently being revisited within computer simulation sutdies .",
    "we have recently published results on the crystallization mechanism in hard spheres that were obtained by a brute force mc simulation @xcite . here",
    "we will add results on nucleation rates and a comparison of two types of microscopic dynamics with experimental data .",
    "in order to test if the details of the short time dynamics affect the nucleation behaviour we have performed two types of simulation : event driven molecular dynamics ( newtonian free flight and collisions ) and monte carlo simulations using only small translational moves ( mimicking brownian dynamics on longtime - scales @xcite ) .    in both cases we monitored crystallization by means of the q6q6-bond order parameter @xcite , the definition of which we briefly recapitulate : for a particle @xmath0 with @xmath1 neighbours , the local orientational structure is characterized by @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the spherical harmonics corresponding to the orientation of the vector @xmath4 between particle @xmath0 and its neighbour @xmath5 in a given coordinate frame .",
    "we are interested in local fcc- , hcp- or rcp - structures .",
    "therefore we consider @xmath6 .",
    "a vector @xmath7 is asigned to each particle , the elements @xmath8 of which are defined as @xmath9 we counted particles counted as neighoburs if their distance @xmath10 .",
    "two neighbouring particles @xmath0 and @xmath5 were regarded as `` bonded '' within a crystalline region , if @xmath11 .",
    "we define @xmath12 as the number of `` bonded '' neighbours of the @xmath0th particle . if a particle has @xmath13 ( i.e. an almost perfectly hexagonally ordered surrounding ) , we call it `` crystalline ''",
    ". a cluster of particles with @xmath14 is named low symmetry cluster ( lsc ) .    in the following we use the particle diameter @xmath15 as unit of length and @xmath16 as unit of energy . for the monte carlo simulations we use 1000 `` sweeps '' (",
    "1000 attempted mc moves per particle ) as unit of time , for the md one time unit ( `` step '' ) corresponds to 27 collisions per particle on average .",
    "the system sizes we simulated were @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 particles .",
    "we studied three densities @xmath21 ( volume fraction @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these densities correspond to chemical potential differences between the metastable liquid and the stable , almost completely crystalline state of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the interfacial tension is of the order of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : stats ] summarizes the simulation runs we have performed .",
    "overcompressed liquid configurations were prepared by a fast pressure quench from the equilibrated liquid . during the quench we monitored crystallinity to ensure that no crystal precursors were formed .",

    "the monte carlo simulations were performed at fixed @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 by small translational moves only .",
    "we let all systems evolve until they crystallized and sampled observables every 5,000 sweeps .",

    ", we used the time when the first crystallite formed , as well as the relation `` number of crystllite versus time '' to extract the nucleation rate . )",
    "we also recorded the times when the last particle with @xmath36 vanished ( `` last '' when playing the movies backwards ) and the time when the cluster shrunk below 40 particles .",
    "for the observables we used to extract the the crystallization rates and to discuss the crystallisation mechanism , we found no difference between these criteria ( apart from a slight shift of the time - scale , obviously ) .",
