    "the study of nuclear systems with strangeness @xmath7 2 is one of the most important and hottest subjects in nuclear physics , since these systems give us unique information on @xmath8 interaction and they might be a doorway to study multi - strangeness systems such as the strange matter . until now , several ways to produce these @xmath7 2 nuclear systems have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the first one is the @xmath9 absorption reaction at rest on nuclei . in these thirty years",
    ", there are three reports on the discovery of double - hypernuclei through the @xmath9 absorption .",
    "these events are found in the emulsion by searching for the sequential weak decay processes ( double stars )  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath9 absorption reaction is the most effective and the most direct way for the double - hypernucleus hunting , it is necessary to produce slow @xmath9 particles , to stop them in the emulsion , and to search for the double stars in the emulsion .",
    "thus the information is still too scarce to determine @xmath8 interaction at present , and further study along this line is necessary .",
    "the second way to produce @xmath10 nuclear systems is the production of double - hypernuclei at the @xmath1 reaction vertices on nuclei .",
    "if @xmath11-nucleus bound states exist and their widths are small enough , we can see discrete peaks in @xmath12 momentum spectra which directly reflect the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "in addition to this clear signal , it is expected that double - hyperfragments produce after double - hyperon compound nuclear formation and evaporation process in the lower @xmath12 momentum region  @xcite .",
    "actually , kek - e176  @xcite group have found @xmath7 2 nuclei at the @xmath1 reaction point in the emulsion target , although its mass can not be specified .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction also provides us with @xmath9 particles which can be used as a source of @xmath9 absorption at rest .",
    "therefore , the study of the @xmath14 reaction on nuclei is important and urgent to explore @xmath7 2 nuclear systems . the relativistic heavy - ion collision is considered to be the third way to produce @xmath7 2 nuclear systems . in this reaction",
    ", more strange nuclei ( @xmath15 ) or strangelets are expected to be produced . however , at the current stage , there is no positive report on the discovery of these nuclei , probably because the production cross section is too small to observe .",
    "recently , it has become experimentally possible to study double strangeness exchange reactions ( @xmath0 )  on nuclear targets .",
    "for example , small angle ( @xmath0 )  cross sections at @xmath16 gev / c were measured on several targets at kek - ps by iijima _",
    "et al . _",
    "the measured @xmath12 momentum spectrum shows a striking structure which gives rise to a target mass number dependence ( @xmath17-dependence ) : in addition to quasifree peaks which correspond to elementary process of @xmath18 , there appear a large bump spreading from @xmath19 gev / c to @xmath20 gev / c , and the yield of this bump in the lower momentum region grows much faster @xmath21 than that of the quasifree peak @xmath22 as the target mass increases .",
    "the comparison of the measured spectrum with the dwia spectrum indicates that the high momentum peak @xmath23 1.1 gev / c has been understood by quasifree process @xmath24 .",
    "however , the huge lower momentum bump can not be explained by the quasifree processes only with well - known elementary reactions such as @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "thus , the appearance of this lower peak bump has casted a doubt on the belief that quasifree processes dominate in meson induced reactions at around 1 gev / c region , and at the same time , it gives us a hope that we can make more abundant double - hypernuclei from the unknown mechanism in this large bump .",
    "therefore , it is important to obtain the knowledge for the reaction mechanism of the ( @xmath0 )  reaction on nuclei .",
    "recently , one of possible mechanisms is proposed by gobbi _",
    "et al . _",
    "they have claimed that a large part of the lower momentum peak is exhausted by the contribution from the heavy - meson production followed by its decay : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 meson .",
    "it should be noted that the first reaction is a so - called subthreshold particle production .",
    "the treatment of the nucleon fermi motion is considered to be important .",
    "since the incident @xmath31 particle has a large cross section with a nucleon in nuclear targets , the first - step reaction occurs mainly in the surface region where the fermi momentum is smaller than that in the inner region .",
    "although this reduction of the effective fermi momentum should largely suppress the subthreshold particle production , it is not taken into account by gobbi _",
    "_ in fact , we can see much less kaon pair creations @xmath32 experimentally in the scintilator - fiber detector  @xcite than those expected in their calculations . therefore , more detailed analyses of these reactions are desired before we conclude that the lower momentum bump comes from heavy - meson decays .",
    "another plausible process is the two - step strangeness exchange and production reaction , such as @xmath33 followed by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote intermediate mesons @xmath37 and hyperons @xmath38 , respectively . in previous works  @xcite ,",
    "the contributions of these two - step processes are estimated to be too small to explain the lower - momentum huge bump . however , these estimations limit the intermediate mesons and hyperons to pions and ground state hyperons , respectively . in addition",
    ", they considered only the target case .",
    "as pointed out by iijima _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , other possible reactions may contribute to the @xmath12 spectrum significantly .",
    "furthermore , the target mass number dependence in the experimental spectrum is well - fitted with @xmath39 in the low momentum region , while @xmath40 in the high momentum region .",
    "this scaling property strongly suggests the contribution of multi - step processes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to treat multi - step processes correctly to evaluate the @xmath12 momentum spectrum .    in this paper , we investigate multi - step effects in the ( @xmath0 )  reactions on the various targets , i.e. , , , , and , using the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model  @xcite .",
    "one of our aims is to see the target mass number dependence on the  momentum distribution in the ( @xmath0 )  reaction .",
    "thus as a first step , we neglect some other effects such as the influence of the potential effect between hadrons .",
    "we will also compare the results of the inc spectrum with the one - step process spectrum in the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) model  @xcite to study the reaction @xmath1 in detail .    in order to calculate the contributions of various two - step processes , there are two problems to be settled .",
    "the first problem is that they involve several elementary processes such as @xmath41 , whose cross sections can not be measured experimentally . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the generalized breit - wigner formula  @xcite , in which @xmath42 channel dominance is assumed and the interference effects between different baryon resonances are ignored .",
    "it has been shown that this formula works well in the energy range under consideration , and it reduces theoretical ambiguities .",
    "the second problem lies in the treatment of complex multi - step processes . for the discussion of multi - step processes , cascade type models",
    "are considered to be the most reliable ones at the current stage : each elementary two - body collision process is treated explicitly , then it is easy to include various multi - step processes .",
    "the inc model does quite well for many situations .",
    "after the first application to high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite , it is also applied to pion - nucleus scattering  @xcite .",
    "in these ten years , considerable efforts have been devoted to extend the inc model .",
    "one of them is the inclusion of mean - field effects within one - body theories  @xcite and @xmath43-body dynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it becomes possible to describe the time - development of totally anti - symmetrized wave functions  @xcite .",
    "these extended versions of the inc model are called microscopic transport models or microscopic simulations , and they have been successful in studying various aspects of heavy - ion collisions as well as light - ion induced reactions  particle production  @xcite , single - particle spectra  @xcite , collective flow  @xcite , and fragment production  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : we describe our inc model in sec .",
    "[ sec : inc ] , and present a ria model in sec .",
    "[ sec : ria ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cross ] , elementary cross sections are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we analyze the experimental data at kek - e176  @xcite and discuss the reaction mechanism of the @xmath1 reactions .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : sumkk ] contains our conclusion .",
    "the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model we adopt here describes the propagation of the leading particle ( the most energetic mesons at each time step ) .",
    "the momentum distribution of a nucleon in the target is assumed to be that of the fermi gas , and the probability and the point of the collision between leading particle and the nucleon are determined by the mean free path of the propagating leading particle .",
    "this prescription is not fully microscopic , since the dynamical evolution of other particles is ignored .",
    "for example , we ignore the change of the nucleon momentum distribution and the secondary collision of a produced hyperon . however , this model is enough to describe the @xmath12 meson production , because other particles than the leading particle can not produce the @xmath12 meson energetically and distortion of the target density is expected to be only important after the @xmath12 meson go out from the target .",
    "most of cascade type models are realized by the monte - calro procedure .",
    "there are several different prescriptions for a cascading of the colliding particles .",
    "one method is a so - called  closest distance approach \"  @xcite ; if the minimum relative distance @xmath44 for any pair of particles becomes less than @xmath45 , that pair is assumed to collide with each other , where @xmath46 is the total cross section for the pair at the c.m . energy @xmath47 . in another one ,",
    "the collision frequency is determined by the mean free path .",
    "for example , the collision will take place with the probability @xmath48  @xcite , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the relative velocity of the colliding pair and the nuclear density , respectively .",
    "we have checked that the both methods give the same results for the @xmath12 momentum distribution in the @xmath1 reaction however , other details may be different in several computer codes , therefore we explain our monte - calro procedure for completeness as follows :    * the incoming  meson which is the first leading particle is boosted at the incident momentum @xmath16gev / c in the laboratory frame .",
    "* to determine where this particle collides with a nucleon in the target nucleus , we generate the fermi momentum randomly with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the case of matter distribution for the nucleus .",
    "if we employ the fermi type nuclear density , the local tomas - fermi approximation is used to obtain the fermi momentum @xmath55 . * the total cross section between the leading particle and the proton(neutron ) @xmath56(@xmath57 )",
    "is determined at this energy .",
    "if the leading particle is a resonance , the decay probability per unit length is calculated as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the total width of the resonance , @xmath49 and @xmath60 denote the velocity and lorentz gamma factor , respectively . *",
    "the mean free path is obtained as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we determine randomly the collision point according to the probability distribution @xmath64 : this distribution is realized by choosing @xmath65 as follows .",
    "@xmath66 with @xmath67 is the momentum of the leading particle , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a random number between @xmath70 . *",
    "if @xmath71 is larger than the nuclear radius @xmath72 , cascading is regarded as finished .",
    "otherwise , we select the branch randomly according to the probabilities of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . *",
    "if the leading particle is determined to collide with other nucleon , the collision branch is chosen randomly according to the partial cross sections , i.e. the elastic or inelastic collision between the leading particle and the nucleon . after choosing the branch , the kinematics of the collision is calculated , and the final momenta of particles after this collision are determined . *",
    "if particles after the collision are nucleons , the pauli blocking is checked .",
    "if its momentum in the laboratory frame is smaller than the fermi momentum 270 mev / c , this collision is considered to be pauli blocked and nothing occurs . * the procedures from 2 to 7 are repeated until this event finishes .    it is useful to mention here that our cascade procedure can be used only for the matter ( constant ) nuclear density @xmath76 . if more realistic density is used in the calculations , as the woods - saxon type density , the collision prescription has to be modified . in that case",
    ", we change the collision rate according to ref .",
    "@xcite or ",
    "closest distance approach \" .",
    "we have checked that the calculated @xmath12 momentum distribution does not depend on the cascading prescription .",
    "since the total cross sections are very small in the ( @xmath0 )  reaction , note that a large amount of computational time is required to get sufficient statistics within the monte calro technique . in this work , therefore , while all the elastic scatterings and the relevant inelastic reactions described in sec.[sec : cross ] are included , we ignore other non - interesting inelastic processes which do not result in the @xmath12 production ; the probabilities for relevant inelastic reactions are increased by the factor of @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the partial cross section for relevant inelastic reactions , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the total and elastic cross sections at each collision energy , respectively .",
    "this procedure modifies the weight for each simulation , since we only treat the elastic scattering and relevant reactions .",
    "thus when the relevant inelastic branch is chosen , the weight for the @xmath81-th simulation event after @xmath82-th step is defined as @xmath83 where the initial value is @xmath84 . under this assumption , the probability to detect the @xmath12 meson with a given impact parameter @xmath85 is calculated as @xmath86 with @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the minimum and the maximum angles detected by the experimental measurement  @xcite , respectively , and @xmath90 represents the number of events generated in the simulation . the weight @xmath91 is defined as the final weight of the @xmath81-th event , and @xmath92 if the @xmath12 particle enters the detector range , otherwise @xmath93 .",
    "typically , we generate 1,000,000 events in this calculations .    in order to compare the theoretical results with the experimental data  @xcite",
    ", we integrate the probability over the impact parameter @xmath94 : @xmath95 where the definition of @xmath96 is the forward cross section averaged over the detected solid angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "in this section , we explain the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria )  @xcite whose results are compared with those of inc .",
    "the ria calculation in this paper is the standard one in the quasifree region , and is essentially the same as iijima _",
    "et al . _",
    "the one - step cross section @xmath97 is calculated from the invariant matrix element @xmath98 and the momentum distribution of a nucleon in the target nucleus : @xmath99 where the suffixes 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 represent @xmath100 and @xmath9 , respectively . as for the proton momentum distribution in nuclei @xmath101 ,",
    "we have adopted fermi gas model with @xmath102 gev / c . in this calculation",
    ", we use the parameterized elementary differential cross sections , as we will express in sec .",
    "[ sec : cross ] , so as to calculate the spin - averaged invariant matrix element squared @xmath103 for elementary process of @xmath104 .",
    "the elementary cross section is written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the invariant mass and the final c.m .",
    "momentum of the elementary process , respectively . using eqs .",
    "( [ riaa ] ) ( [ riab ] ) ( [ riac ] ) , we get the one - step quasifree cross sections as follows , @xmath108 in the ria model , distortions of the initial @xmath31 and final @xmath12 mesons are usually treated in the eikonal approximation .",
    "thus the effective proton number @xmath109 which represents the collision frequency of the particles , is given by @xmath110 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the nuclear density , and @xmath111 mb and @xmath112 mb are  -nucleon and  -nucleon total cross sections , respectively .    for productions of the intermediate vector and scalar mesons and their decay , we use following expressions in ria : @xmath113 where the four momentum of the meson is represented as @xmath114 , and the suffixes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 represent @xmath115 and @xmath31 , respectively . in this reaction",
    ", we have assumed that ( 1 ) the lifetime of the meson is long enough , and ( 2 ) the decay occurs isotropically . the assumption ( 1 )",
    "is realized by the approximation to the green function @xmath116 . in the case of the scalar meson ,",
    "the green function is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the total decay width of the meson .",
    "note that the assumption ( 1 ) is already used in eq.([ria - deca ] ) implicitly , since the effective proton number @xmath119 is calculated under the assumption that the meson @xmath27 does not decay inside the nucleus .",
    "the matrix element @xmath120 can be calculated under the assumption ( 2 ) , which is obtained as @xmath121 thus , the differential cross section for the @xmath12 particle through the meson decay can be expressed as @xmath122 where the solid angle @xmath123 is calculated in the rest frame of @xmath12 , and @xmath124 denotes the invariant cross section for the one - step intermediate meson production per a proton , which is given by eq.([ria - dirb ] ) without the effective proton number @xmath125 .",
    "now let us explain the elementary cross sections used in this paper .",
    "all the energies and cross sections are give in gev and mb unit , respectively .",
    "we have categorized the events into three types .",
    "the first category is the direct - type reaction , which concerns the one - step double strangeness exchange reaction @xmath126 .",
    "the second one is the heavy scalar and vector meson productions and their decay @xmath127 proposed by gobbi _",
    "et al . _",
    "the third type is the two - step strangeness exchange and production reaction , such as @xmath128 followed by @xmath129 .",
    "we will explain the necessary elementary cross sections in this order .",
    "* all the elastic scatterings and charge exchange reactions of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "* double strangeness exchange processes : * @xmath132 * initial anti - kaon interaction : * @xmath133 .",
    "* decay of resonance kaons ( anti - kaons ) : * @xmath134 , @xmath135 ,   * final kaon interactions : * @xmath136 ) , * @xmath137 ) .",
    "although the actual strangeness exchange occurs only in the processes of ( b ) , initial and final state interactions have to be included when we are interested in the absolute and whole spectrum of @xmath12 including the lower momentum region , as will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the above cross sections are fitted to the experimental data  @xcite with appropriate functions or tabulated .",
    "the total , elastic and charge exchange cross sections of ( a ) are well - known experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we employ here the smooth interpolations of these data .",
    "angular dependencies of the elastic collisions are simply assumed to have the form  @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the square of the transferred four momentum ,   is the c.m .",
    "energy , and @xmath140 is taken to be @xmath141 .",
    "the double strangeness exchange reactions ( b ) are also well - known experimentally although the errorbars are still large .",
    "therefore , we use following parameterization for the elementary @xmath11 and @xmath142 production cross sections : @xmath143   & \\qquad { \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}\\leq 2.22 \\mathrm{[gev / c]}\\\\[0.2 cm ]     \\displaystyle {        { 0.00613({\\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 1.81496)^{0.48020 }          \\over ( { \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 2.02435)^2 + 0.01739 }     } & \\\\     \\displaystyle {       + { 0.001673({\\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 2.11496)^{0.338065 }            \\over({\\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 2.3174)^2 + 0.016429 }     } \\quad [ { { \\rm mb } } ]      & \\qquad { \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$ } } > 2.22 \\mathrm{[gev / c ] }    \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath144\\ , \\\\ \\sigma(k^- p \\to k^+ \\xi^{*-}(1530 ) ) & = &    { 0.0017692({\\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 2.0264)^{0.45434 }          \\over ( { \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s}$}}- 2.09274)^2 + 0.01394 }    \\quad [ { { \\rm mb}}]\\ , \\\\",
