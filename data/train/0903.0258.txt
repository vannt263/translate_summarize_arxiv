    "after some tries @xcite at defining and studying quantum cellular automata , it is now believed to be fairly well understood how reversible quantum cellular automata ( rqca ) should be defined , and what their basic properties are . as with classical cellular automata ( ca ) , there are two levels on which rqca are defined : as local transition functions or as global evolutions .",
    "the definition of rqca proposed in @xcite focuses only on the properties of the global evolution , based on the two essential points of invariance by translation and locality .",
    "it was also proved in the same paper that each reversible cellular automaton could be `` quantized '' in a natural way , and the result would be a rqca .",
    "furthermore , it was proved that rqca can be implemented with local means , thereby reinforcing the parallel with ca ; this was first done in the one - dimensional case @xcite , the result being later extended to the general case @xcite .",
    "also , they involve no measurement procedure ; the global evolution of a rqca can be described by a unitary operator , while its decomposition as layers of local operations consists only of small unitary transformations .",
    "we would like now to extend this framework to include cases where the global evolution is no longer described by a unitary operator , but by an isometry .",
    "this would be the first step in the investigation of nonreversible quantum cellular automata ( nrqca ) .",
    "the main problem with this topic , nowadays , is that there is no practical definition for such things .",
    "our aim is to provide such a definition and work out the basic properties of nrqca .",
    "invariance by translation and locality as defined in @xcite are still properties that nrqca should obviously have . in this paper",
    "we will ask and answer this question : when does the quantization of a ca have these properties ?",
    "since the translational invariance comes freely , the real question is : when is the quantization local ?",
    "section  [ definitions ] will be devoted to the mandatory definitions .",
    "we will be quick as we assume the reader is familiar with the basics of ca and somewhat familiar with quantum computing .",
    "we then show with theorem  [ thm_central ] that the locality  more precisely , the _ uniform _ locality , cf .",
    "definition  [ locality ]  of the quantization is equivalent to reversibility , therefore extending the results presented in  @xcite , and proving that no nrqca can be constructed in this way . in section  [ annexe ] , we discuss the one - dimensional case .",
    "we show that , in some cases , even if the quantization is not uniformly local , it can still be local in a weaker sense which forbids some kinds of long - distance communications .",
    "we will now introduce the basic definitions of quantum cellular automata . for technical reasons",
    ", we will work mainly with finite configurations .",
    "this is because they are countable , as opposed to infinite configurations , and we want to have vector spaces of countable dimension , so as to simplify the formalism of @xcite .",
    "this distinction between finite and infinite configurations is not so important , as was shown in  @xcite ; anyway , we are only interested in locality conditions for quantizations of ca",
    ". we do not restrict the dimension of the space , which will be some positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "we denote @xmath1 the quiescent state , and @xmath2 the rest of the alphabet , assuming @xmath3 ; the union of @xmath2 and @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 .",
    "the sets of finite configurations is denoted @xmath6 ; it contains the elements of @xmath7 that are equal to @xmath1 almost everywhere on @xmath8 .",
    "whilst configurations hold the basic states of an entire line of cells , and hence denote the possible basic states of the entire qca , the global state of a qca may well turn out to be a superposition of these . the following definition works because @xmath9 is a countably infinite set .",
    "[ superp ] + let @xmath10 be the hilbert space of configurations , defined as follows . to each finite configuration @xmath11 is associated a unit vector @xmath12 , such that the family @xmath13 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath14 .",
    "superposition of configurations _ is then a unit vector in @xmath14 .",
    "we used here dirac notation .",
    "likewise , @xmath15 denotes the dual of @xmath12 , i.e. the linear form on @xmath14 such that for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which is noted @xmath18 , is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "these notations may then be combined the other way around , @xmath20 being the linear transformation of @xmath14 such that @xmath21 is , quite naturally , equal to @xmath22 .",
    "_ states _ on @xmath10 are nonnegative hermitian operators of trace @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , for each superposition of configurations @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a state , called in this case a _ pure _ state .",
    "physically , states describe the actual state of matter ; they bear all the information that can be measured in the system .",
    "the cells of our ca are in the pure state @xmath25 when what lies on them is , with certainty , the superposition @xmath24 .",
    "actually , each state can be approximated by convex combinations of pure states .",
    "it means that the actual physical state of our ca at some moment can be described as a ( possibly infinite ) sum @xmath26 , where the @xmath27 s are positive , @xmath28 and the @xmath29 s are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "we will be manipulating isometries a lot .",
    "unitary operators should be well - known , but isometries are probably somewhat less familiar , so let us write down their definition .",
    "a linear operator @xmath30 is _ isometric _ if and only if @xmath31 is an orthonormal family of @xmath10 .",
    "this can also be expressed simply using the adjoint @xmath32 of @xmath33 . by definition , when @xmath33 is a endomorphism of @xmath14 , @xmath32 is the endomorphism of @xmath14 such that for every @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this way , @xmath32 is indeed always unique ; however , it is defined if and only if @xmath33 is continuous .",
    "when @xmath33 is isometric , @xmath33 is of course continuous , and actually , @xmath33 is isometric iff @xmath36 .",
    "if , moreover , @xmath33 is onto , it is said to be @xmath37 ; so @xmath33 is unitary if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "now , we are talking about ca , whose one important feature is shift - invariance . the definition of shift - invariance in a quantum context , with all these linearizations , is actually no more tedious than in the classical case ; here it is .",
    "[ shift - invariance ] + consider the shift operation which takes configuration @xmath39 to @xmath40 where , for all @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be its linear extension . a linear operator @xmath44 is said to be _ shift invariant _ if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "the second important feature of ca is their locality . in the classical case ,",
    "we know that the locality is equivalent to the continuity of the global evolution on infinite configurations .",
    "unfortunately , there does not seem to be such a result in the quantum case ; at least it is not obvious what the right topology on superpositions of configurations should be .",
    "therefore , the definition of locality proposed in @xcite is more concrete .",
    "it explicitly states that to know the state of some region of the space after an iteration of the ca , you only need to know the state of a slightly larger region beforehand . in the classical case",
    ", you would trivially deduce from this property that the global evolution stems from a local transition rule . in the quantum case",
    "however , things are not so simple as entanglement suddenly comes into play , and when @xmath33 is unitary it turns out @xcite you need to keep things locally reversible .    to give the actual definition of locality , we first need to introduce some vocabulary .",
    "first , we will make abundant use throughout this paper of the minkowski sum . for two subsets @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xmath8 , the minkowski sum of @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 , noted @xmath48 , is the set @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is naturally the minkowski difference , @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath14 has a natural structure of tensor product .",
    "namely , for a subset @xmath46 of @xmath8 , let us note @xmath52 the set of the finite words on @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath14 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the complementary of @xmath46 in @xmath8 and @xmath55 is the hilbert space whose canonical basis is indexed by the elements of @xmath56 .",
    "that being said , there are two more definitions we need before moving on .",
    "the first one should be familiar , it is also known as `` trace out '' and occurs whenever a quantum system can be divided into two subsystems .",
    "informally , if a system @xmath57 can be written as the tensor product of two subsystems @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and given a state @xmath60 on @xmath57 , you can chose to ignore completely what is going on @xmath59 and restrict your universe to @xmath58 .",
    "the state you get on @xmath58 is then the restriction of @xmath60 to @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a state over @xmath14 and @xmath46 a subset of @xmath8 .",
    "one can write @xmath61 , where the @xmath62 s and @xmath63 s are respectively operators over @xmath55 and @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65 , the _ reduction _ of @xmath60 to @xmath46 , is a state on @xmath55 defined as @xmath66 ; this does not depend on the way @xmath60 was decomposed in the first place .",
    "the following definition is the dual of the last one .",
    "why it is its dual will appear in proposition  [ localization ] .",
    "a linear endomorphism of @xmath14 is _ localized _ in a subset @xmath46 of @xmath8 if it is of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath58 is an endomorphism of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the identity on @xmath64 .",
    "we can now explain the duality going on here with this lemma , which is stated and proved as lemma  3 in @xcite .",
    "[ measure ]   + let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be hilbert spaces , with @xmath70 of finite dimension @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 denote some elements of @xmath74 with @xmath75 having reductions @xmath76 over @xmath70 .",
    "we then have that @xmath58 is localized in @xmath70 iff    `` for every states @xmath60 and @xmath77 , if @xmath78 then @xmath79 '' .",
    "moreover we have that @xmath78 is equivalent to    `` if @xmath58 is localized in @xmath70 , then @xmath79 '' .",
    "the proposition [ localization ] we introduce next comes from theorem  3 in @xcite .",
    "it entails structural reversibility , i.e. the fact that the inverse function of a rqca is also a rqca .",
    "since we want now to talk about nonunitary operators , we have to restate it for general linear operators .",
    "we also have to extend the domain of localization of this operator from one cell to a set of cells .",
    "it will also serve as a definition of locality for linear endomorphisms over @xmath14  which is not to be confused with localization .",
    "note that the hypothesis of continuity for @xmath33 provides the existence of its adjoint @xmath32 .",
    "it defines the locality `` at somewhere '' in the space . intuitively , a global transition is said to be local at some locus if the physical state in this locus after the transition depends only on the physical state on a neighbourhood of this locus beforehand ( this is point ( i ) of the proposition ) .",
    "equivalently , one could say that the result of each measure done on this locus after the transition could be predicted beforehand by measures performed on its neighbourhood ( that would be point ( ii ) ) .     + [ localization ]",

    "but @xmath104 is a morphism , hence @xmath105 also commutes with @xmath106 . because @xmath101 can be chosen amongst to full matrix algebra @xmath107 of cell @xmath41 , this entails that @xmath106 must be the identity upon this cell .",

    ", in this case , the assumption of locality at the central cell implies the locality at each finite subset @xmath46 of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , this locality is uniform , in the sense that a same neihbourghood @xmath81 can be chosen for all @xmath46 s .",
    "however , if we remove this hypothesis of unitarity , things are not so simple and we have to make stronger hypotheses ; hence the following definitions .    [ locality ]",
    "a continuous linear endomorphism @xmath33 of @xmath14 is _ everywhere local _ if , for every finite subset @xmath46 of @xmath8 , @xmath33 is local at @xmath46 .",

    "let @xmath114 be a cellular automaton on finite configurations , @xmath115 its linearization . for it to have a physical meaning and earn its name of `` quantization '' , it should be an isometry , i.e. @xmath116 should be one - to - one .",
    "we will nevertheless make a seemingly weaker assumption ; we only assume @xmath117 to be defined , in order to be able to apply definition  [ locality ] and ask when @xmath118 is local ; it turns out that this condition actually implies the injectivity of @xmath116 .    in order for @xmath117 to be defined",
    ", we have to assume that @xmath118 is continuous .",
    "beware that this notion of continuity has nothing to do with any kind of topology on the set of words , and is therefore not related to the continuity of @xmath116 , which is true by definition of a ca . for @xmath118 to be continuous means that it is bounded on the unit sphere of @xmath14 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath116 is one - to - one . to verify this ,",
    "let us first assume @xmath116 is one - to - one .",
    "then @xmath117 is isometric , and consequently continuous .",
    "let us now assume @xmath116 is not one - to - one . since @xmath116 is defined on the finite configurations , for every @xmath119 , there exists @xmath120 such that @xmath121 has a number of antecedents @xmath122 greater than @xmath119  just repeat as many times as needed some finite configuration having several antecedents .",
    "but then @xmath123 is a unit vector whose image by @xmath118 , @xmath124 , has norm @xmath125 ; hence , @xmath118 is not bounded on the unit sphere , i.e. not continuous . to close this chapter on @xmath117 ,",

    ".    we will be monitoring @xmath131 as an example , for which we will allow the quiescent state @xmath1 to be renamed @xmath91 , the only letter in @xmath2 being @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath131 acts exactly as the usual @xmath131 : it sums modulo @xmath132 the bits in its neighbourhood @xmath133 . of course",
    ", @xmath131 is not reversible , since @xmath134 and @xmath135 are sent locally on the same word .",
    "it is one - to - one on finite configurations , though , while not surjective .",
    "it was already stated in proposition  1 of @xcite that the quantization of nonreversible automata that are bijective on finite configurations could not be local , but that left the case of such automata as @xmath131 unsettled .",
    "the following theorem does the job .",
    "[ thm_central ] suppose @xmath116 is one - to - one .",
    "then @xmath118 is uniformly local if and only if @xmath116 is reversible .",
    "let us first briefly justify that when @xmath116 is reversible , @xmath118 is uniformly local .",
    "this is essentially what states the lemma  4 of @xcite , though in this case it is the automaton as defined on infinite configurations that is quantized .",
    "it is quite straightforward to adapt the statement and the proof of this lemma to our formalism , to get the same result : if @xmath116 admits a neighbourhood @xmath136 and an inverse neighbourhood @xmath137 , then @xmath138 is a neighbourhood @xmath139 ; this is actually a direct consequence of lemma  [ gros_bordel ] .",
    "however , there is a much simpler proof that such a neighbourhood exists .",
    "first , decompose your automaton into block permutations , with auxiliary bits if needed .",
    "linearize then each of these block permutations .",
    "the composition of all these local unitary transformations is then @xmath140 , where @xmath69 is the identity on the auxiliary qubits , and the block decomposition from which it is constructed is a witness that @xmath118 is uniformly local .",
    "we now prove the other implication , in a way that can be seen as a generalization of the argument presented page  7 of @xcite .",
    "it proceeds by contraposition , so let us first of all assume @xmath116 is not reversible .",
    "we will prove that for every set @xmath81 there exists a set @xmath46 such that @xmath118 can not satisfy the condition ( i ) of proposition  [ localization ] ; this will mean that @xmath118 is not uniformly local .",
    "let @xmath81 be a finite subset of @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath116 is not reversible , there exists a finite subset @xmath47 of @xmath8 such that @xmath141 but @xmath142 . let @xmath143 ; since @xmath144 and @xmath145 both are finite configurations , @xmath46 is finite",
    ".    let @xmath146 denote the superpositions of configurations @xmath147 , and let @xmath148 be the pure states @xmath149 .",
    "we are now going to prove that @xmath150 , while @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath144 and @xmath145 are equal on @xmath152 , @xmath85 does not intersect @xmath47 , so @xmath153 and @xmath154 differ on some point on the complement of @xmath85 .",
    "considering the partition of @xmath8 into @xmath85 and @xmath155 , we can thus write @xmath156 and @xmath157 , where @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160",
    ". we then have    @xmath161    thus , the reductions of @xmath162 and @xmath163 and @xmath85 are indeed equal .",
    "now , @xmath164 , where @xmath165 . since @xmath144 and @xmath145 coincide on @xmath54 , we actually have @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is a ( pure ) state over @xmath64 , and the @xmath168 s are states over @xmath68",
    ". the reductions of @xmath169 to @xmath46 are then @xmath168 , which are distinct states since @xmath162 and @xmath163 where distinct to begin with .",
    "another way to present this proof is to appeal to the perennial alice and bob .",
    "we start with the state @xmath162 .",
    "alice and bob have access to some cells of @xmath8 , meaning that they can conjugate the state on @xmath14 with unitary operators , as long as these unitary operators are localized in the region of the space they were assigned .",
    "so let alice and bob s regions be respectively @xmath46 and @xmath47 as encountered in the proof of theorem  [ thm_central ] .",
    "we will see how they can communicate through the use of @xmath118 , even though their regions could be at quite a large distance from each other , depending on @xmath81 .    since @xmath170 , bob is able to transform at will @xmath162 into @xmath163 , by performing a _ controlled phase - shift _ on some cell where @xmath153 and @xmath154 differ .",
    "what that means informally is that , since bob is able to tell the difference between @xmath153 and @xmath154 in his area , he can introduce a dissimetry between @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "of course he could simply transform @xmath172 by changing the letters of @xmath154 is some cells or something like that , but that would not allow him to communicate any faster than in the classical case .",
    "so what bob does is to change @xmath172 into @xmath173 , something more immaterial , purely quantum and , in a way `` delocalized '' , that will allow alice to catch his message , which is one bit of information : `` did i or did nt i change @xmath162 into @xmath163 ? '' .",
    "after bob did his thing , @xmath118 is applied to the state .",
    "now , alice being able to actually read the message is due to the fact that her region contains all the cells where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "as explained in the proof of theorem  [ thm_central ] , the state after @xmath118 has been applied is a tensor product of a state on @xmath46 and a state on @xmath54 , the state on @xmath54 not depending on the prior actions of bob ; therefore , the state on @xmath46 does depend on them , so alice must have a way to distinguish between them  in this case she just has to perform a so - called _ swap - test_. let us see for instance what happens with @xmath131 .",
    "consider these two words in @xmath6 :    @xmath174    their images are    @xmath175    now put bob on the middle of the stripe , and alice at the two cells where the @xmath23 s are in @xmath145 . by following the protocol described in the proof of theorem  [ thm_central ] , bob can indeed send a bit of information to alice .",
    "there is no doubt that this is a correct proof that @xmath176 is not uniformly local , but one might argue that this idea of an `` alice '' surrounding bob makes little sense : surely if alice can be present at two faraway places in the stripe at the same time , it means he must have some way to go from one place to the other , and since in the middle stands bob , why would she bother using @xmath176 to send her message ?",
    "can not we find another protocol where alice stands either on the left or on the right of bob , but on only one side at a time ?",
    "actually , no , we can not , and this is related to the fact that @xmath176 , while not uniformly local , is still everywhere local : if bob is forbidden the access to the cells located between alice s positions , then he can not transmit her any message .",
    "the proof of this assertion is the object of the next section .",
    "the question is : when is the quantization of a one - to - one ca everywhere local ?",
    "we are going now to give a proof that in the one - dimensional case , it is equivalent to the openness of @xmath177 , the extension of @xmath116 to the set @xmath178 of infinite configurations ; so let us fix the dimension @xmath0 to @xmath23 for this section .",
    "first , it might be useful to remind what it means for @xmath177 to be open .",

    "then the hypothesis is equivalent to    @xmath256    let us now try translating our aim in the same way .",
    "first we have    @xmath257    @xmath258    @xmath259    so what we want to prove is that , for every @xmath260 and @xmath261 in @xmath262 ,    @xmath263    with the convention that these numbers are @xmath91 when @xmath264 is not appliable . for @xmath265 ,",
    "let @xmath266 be the set of couples @xmath252 of words in @xmath6 such that @xmath267 , @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "what we want to prove from ( [ hypothse ] ) is the equivalent to    @xmath270    we will prove this by showing that for each @xmath271 , there is some set @xmath272 such that @xmath273 , ie @xmath266 is the disjoint union of the @xmath251 s for @xmath237 in @xmath272 .    on the one hand",
    ", it is quite immediate by definition that , when @xmath274 , @xmath251 and @xmath275 are disjoint . on the other hand , by hypothesis ,",
    "every @xmath252 of @xmath266 is in some @xmath251 , so that @xmath272 may be found in this simple way : for each @xmath252 in @xmath266 , find the unique @xmath276 such that @xmath252 is in @xmath277 , and then define @xmath272 to be the set of all these @xmath237 s you found .",
    "the only problem is that you could add unwanted @xmath252 s by doing so ; we need only checking that this is not the case .",
    "in other words , we have to prove that whenever the intersection between @xmath251 and @xmath266 is nonempty , then the former is included in the latter .",
    "so , let @xmath252 be an en element of @xmath278 and @xmath279 an other element of @xmath251 .",
    "first of all , since @xmath280 and @xmath281 coincide on @xmath85 ( where they are equal to @xmath153 ) , and in particular on @xmath282 , then @xmath283 and @xmath284 coincide on @xmath46 , thus @xmath285 .",
    "likewise , of course , @xmath286 .",
    "then , by hypothesis and since @xmath46 is finite and @xmath269 , @xmath280 and @xmath287 coincide on @xmath288 , not only on @xmath155 .",
    "this implies that @xmath153 and @xmath154 must coincide on @xmath289 , and as a consequence @xmath281 and @xmath290 do also coincide on @xmath288 ; thus @xmath291 and @xmath292 coincide on @xmath293 .",
    "lastly , since @xmath280 and @xmath281 coincide on @xmath294 , so do @xmath295 and @xmath291 on @xmath296 .",
    "likewise , @xmath297 and @xmath292 coincide on that same interval .",
    "however , @xmath295 and @xmath297 coincide on @xmath54 , by hypothesis ; ergo , @xmath291 and @xmath292 coincide on @xmath298 .",
    "put it together , you finally get that @xmath291 and @xmath292 coincide on @xmath54 ; q.e.d .",
    "@xmath299 being , as can be checked easily on its de bruijn diagram , open , it is thus everywhere local , which also means alice has to surround bob in order to receive his long - distance calls . on the contrary ,",
    "the modified version of @xmath131 that was defined in the definition  11 of @xcite is not open on the infinite configurations , which is why we were able to find a protocol where bob and alice lie on two distinct sides of the stripe .",
    "starting only with the assumption that we should be able to use the adjoint of @xmath118 , this implied it should be isometric , thus convey a physical meaning as a valid quantum evolution .",
    "if we then add the constraint that it should be uniformly local  something that you would certainly expect a cellular automaton to verify in any model  it turns out @xmath116 has to be reversible , so that @xmath118 is part of the already well - known class of rqca .",
    "this is good news in a way : the notion of a rqca is a robust one ; however , it could nevertheless be considered a downside .",
    "indeed , as stated in the introduction , rqca are now believed to be fairly well understood , so the next challenge is understanding nonreversible quantum cellular automata .",
    "it would certainly have been of great help to be able to construct such nrqca by quantizing nonreversible ca .",
    "alas , this paper shows that such a thing is impossible .",
    "quantizing one - dimensional open non - reversible automata certainly provides puzzling entities , but no quantum ca ; there remains however an interesting open question about the generalization of proposition  [ open ] to higher dimensions .",
    "then again , the most important question right now is : what are nrqca ? can they be defined from their global evolution in a reasonably simple way ?",
    "this question , in its most general form , includes the same one concerning randomized automata instead of quantum ones , since classical randomness is part of the quantum world , and as far as we know this question has been little studied .",
    "let us ask it in a more precise way : what is the property on the global evolution of probability distributions that characterizes randomized cellular automata , i.e. those transformations that can be written as a finite number of layers , each of them consisting of a tiling of identical blocks performing some local random transformation ?",
    "we would like to thank guillaume theyssier for pointing out useful references and reinhard werner for asking the right questions and providing useful advices and encouragement .",
    "also , a special thanks to the reviewer who remarked that a proof was absent and another one unclear , two remarks leading to the discovery of two mistakes in the first version of the paper , which led in turn to substantial rewriting .",
    "our best hope is not to have introduced too many new mistakes in the process .",
