    "let us consider a phenomenological model of nonlocal nonlinear kerr type media , in which the refractive index change @xmath0 induced by a beam with intensity @xmath1 can be represented in general form as @xmath2 where the positive ( negative ) sign corresponds to a focusing ( defocusing ) nonlinearity and _ x _ and _ z _ denote transverse and propagation coordinates , respectively .",
    "the real , localized , and symmetric function @xmath3 is the response function of the nonlocal medium , whose width determines the degree of nonlocality . for a singular response , @xmath4",
    ", the refractive index change becomes a local function of the light intensity , @xmath5 , i.e.  the refractive index change at a given point is solely determined by the light intensity at that very point . with increasing width of @xmath3",
    "the light intensity in the vicinity of the point @xmath6 also contributes to the index change at that point . in the limit of a highly nonlocal response snyder and",
    "mitchell showed that the beam evolution was described by the simple equation for a linear harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the influence of nonlocality of the nonlinear response on the dynamics of beams was illustrated for the special logarithmic nonlinearity , which allows exact analytical treatment @xcite .    while eq .",
    "( [ nonlocal ] ) is a phenomenological model , it nevertheless describes several real physical situations .",
    "possible physical mechanisms responsible for this type of nonlinear response includes various transport effects , such as heat conduction in materials with thermal nonlinearity @xcite , diffusion of molecules or atoms accompanying nonlinear light propagation in atomic vapours @xcite , and drift and/or diffusion of photoexcited charges in photorefractive materials @xcite .",
    "a highly nonlocal nonlinearity of the form ( [ nonlocal ] ) has also been identified in plasmas @xcite and it appears as a result of many body interaction processes in the description of bose - einstein condensates @xcite . even though it is quite apparent in some physical situations that the nonlinear response in general is nonlocal ( as in the case of thermal lensing ) ,",
    "the nonlocal contribution to the refractive index change was often neglected @xcite .",
    "this is justified if the spatial scale of the beam is large compared to the characteristic response length of the medium ( given by the width of the response function ) .",
    "however , for very narrow beams the nonlocality can be of crucial importance and has to be taken into account .",
    "for instance , it has been shown theoretically that a weak nonlocal contribution arrests collapse ( catastrophic self - focusing ) of high power optical beams in a self - focusing medium and leads to the formation of stable 2d ( diffracting in two transverse dimensions ) solitons @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a purely nonlocal nonlinearity leads to formation of so - called cusp solitons , which , however , are unstable @xcite . some of the consequences of nonlocality in the nonlinear response have been observed experimentally .",
    "suter and blasberg reported stabilization of 2d solitary beams in atomic vapors due to atomic diffusion , which carries excitation away from the interaction region @xcite .",
    "also , the discrepancy between the theoretical model of dark solitons and that observed experimentally in a medium with thermal nonlinearity has been associated with nonlocality of the nonlinearity @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the propagation of 1d beams in nonlinear media having a weakly nonlocal response of the general form ( [ nonlocal ] ) .",
    "our goal is to find exact analytical solutions for bright and dark spatial solitons and use them to determine soliton properties , such as existence and stability .",
    "we start with the paraxial wave equation describing propagation of a 1d beam with envelope function @xmath7 and intensity @xmath8 , @xmath9 when the nonlocality is weak , i.e.  when the response function @xmath3 is narrow compared to the extent of the beam , we can expand @xmath10 around the point @xmath11 to obtain @xmath12 where the nonlocality parameter @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 and where we have assumed that the response function is normalized , @xmath15 .",
    "note that for @xmath4 , @xmath16 and eq .",
    "( [ laplacian ] ) describes the local kerr nonlinearity . for weakly nonlocal meda @xmath17",
    "is a small parameter .    substituting @xmath18 , given by eq .",
    "( [ laplacian ] ) , into eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) gives the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath19 the weak nonlocality appears thus as a perturbation to the local nonlinear refractive index change .",
    "for a single peak beam in a self - focusing medium this perturbation is of negative sign in the central part of the beam , where it serves to decrease the refractive index change .",
    "hence , even for very narrow and sharp intensity distributions , the resulting self - induced waveguide will be wide and a smooth function of the transverse coordinates . in some sense",
    ", this is similar to saturation of the nonlinearity .",
    "one may therefore expect that certain features of solitons of eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) will be reminiscent of those exhibited by solitons in saturable nonlinear media .",
    "it transpires , however , that nonlocality also results in new effects , especially for self - defocusing nonlinearities . in the following we consider separately the case of self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities",
    "for a self - focusing nonlinearity the sign of the refractive index change is positive .",
    "we search for a stationary bright soliton solution to eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) of the form @xmath20 where the profile @xmath21 is real , symmetric , and exponentially localized and the propagation constant @xmath22 is positive . for this solution eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) reduces to @xmath23 which can be integrated once to give the equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an integration constant . for exponentially localized solutions @xmath26 .",
    "using that @xmath27 has its maximum @xmath28 at the center @xmath29 we futher obtain the well - known relation between the propagation constant @xmath30 and the amplitude @xmath28 @xmath31 equation ( [ stationary_eq ] ) can therefore be simplified to @xmath32 interestingly , had the local and nonlocal contributions been of opposite signs , i.e.  @xmath33 ( as can happen for intense laser beams in plasmas ) , then a solution to eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) would only exist if the peak intensity @xmath34 is less than the critical value @xmath35 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a final integration leads to @xmath36 where we have defined the intensity @xmath37 and the normalized intensity @xmath38 .",
    "this implicit relation gives the profile of bright spatial solitons propagating in weakly nonlocal kerr - like media . in the local limit , @xmath16",
    ", we recover from eq .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) the well - known profile @xmath39 of the 1d bright soliton in a kerr medium .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the intensity profile of the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) for different values of the nonlocality parameter @xmath40 .",
    "evidently , an increase in the degree of nonlocality results in an increase of the soliton width - nonlocality smooths out the refractive index profile thereby leading to a broadening of the beam .",
    "this effect is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "3 where we plot the width of the bright solitons ( fwhm of the intensity profile ) versus the degree of nonlocality @xmath40 for different peak intensities ; the soliton width increases monotonically with the degree of nonlocality .",
    "an important aspect of any family of soliton solutions is their stability properties . for single peak solitons stability",
    "is determined by the dependence of the power @xmath41 on the propagation constant @xmath30 .",
    "solitons are stable if @xmath42 and unstable otherwise @xcite . for the model considered here @xmath43 can be found analytically to @xmath44 by using eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) . for weakly nonlocal media with @xmath17 the power",
    "is approximately given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the soliton power in the limit of a local response with @xmath40=0 .",
    "the derivative @xmath47 can easily be found from eq .",
    "( [ pgen ] ) and it transpires that the power is a monotonically increasing function of the propagation constant ( for @xmath13 ) , indicating that the solitons are stable .",
    "interestingly again , had @xmath40 been negative , then the bright solitons would exist for sufficiently low peak intensities , @xmath48 , but be unstable for @xmath49 , for which @xmath47 is negative ( see again @xcite ) .    to demonstrate the stability of the bright solitons for @xmath13 we numerically integrated eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) using the split - step fourier method and the exact soliton solution as initial condition . in all simulations ( for both bright and dark solitons )",
    "we used a steplength of @xmath50 and a transverse resolution of @xmath51 .",
    "results of the numerical simulations are shown in fig .",
    "4 where we demonstrate propagation and collision of two bright solitons with unit amplitude @xmath52 .",
    "it is evident that the solitons propagate in a stable manner .",
    "the collision , on the other hand , is not completely elastic and causes the soliton amplitude and width to oscillate slightly .",
    "the bright solitons of the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) were considered by davydova and fischuk in the context of focusing of upper hybrid waves in plasma @xcite . in particular , the existence of bright soliton solutions and their stability was reported by these authors .",
    "however , the explicit expression ( [ solution1 ] ) was not given and no numerical confirmation was presented .",
    "we now consider the impact of weak nonlocality in the case of a self - defocusing nonlinearity , which corresponds to a negative sign in eq.([laplacian ] ) .",
    "we introduce a new spatial variable @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the soliton transverse velocity , and look for stationary solutions of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the soliton intensity and @xmath57 its phase .",
    "substitution of this form into eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) yields @xmath58 we are interested in dark solitons , i.e.  solutions with an intensity dip on a constant background .",
    "integrating the system ( [ dark2]-[dark1 ] ) once we obtain that the soliton background intensity @xmath34 determines the soliton propagation constant @xmath30 and that the center intensity @xmath59 determines the transverse velocity @xmath54 , through the relations @xmath60 which are exactly the same as those obtained for a purely local response .",
    "we further find that the soliton intensity @xmath56 is governed by the equation @xmath61 obviously , a solution to eq .",
    "( [ dark - ode ] ) exists only if the background intensity does not exceed a certain critical value , @xmath62 which coinsides with the critical peak intensity above which bright solitons does not exist in a focusing nonlocal medium when @xmath33 , as discussed above .",
    "it can be shown that the relation ( [ critical ] ) represents the stability condition for the plane wave solution to equation ( [ nls1 ] ) with a defocusing nonlinearity . for background intensities larger than @xmath63 the plane wave solutions",
    "becomes modulationally unstable @xcite .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ dark - ode ] ) once more we obtain @xmath64 which is an implicit relation between the soliton intensity @xmath65 and the spatial coordinate @xmath66 , with the normalized intensity now given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for the soliton phase",
    "we obtain @xmath69 where we have used the gauge invariance of eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) to remove a constant phase contribution ( phase in the center ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present examples of the intensity profile of the dark solitons for different values of the nonlocality parameter @xmath40 .",
    "these graphs show that increasing nonlocality decreases the width of the soliton . to better illustrate this effect we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the width of the dark solitons ( defined as the distance between points where the intensity is @xmath70 ) versus @xmath40 for several values of the soliton contrast @xmath71 .",
    "we see that unlike saturation , which tends to increase the width of dark solitons , nonlocality has the opposite effect .",
    "this is due to the fact that nonlocality causes the nonlinear index change to advance towards regions of lower light intensity . in the case of bright solitons",
    "this effect leads to soliton expansion .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] also indicate the interesting effect that for strong nonlocality , all dark solitons acquire the same width .",
    "actually , in this limit , i.e.  when @xmath40 approaches the critical value @xmath72 the relation ( [ dark - amplitude ] ) can be inverted leading to a simple expression for the soliton intensity profile @xmath73 , & |u_0\\zeta| \\leq \\pi/2 \\\\",

    ", these dark solitons can be represented in the complex plane describing the real and imaginary part of the soliton amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "any soliton solution is then represented by a trajectory in this plane .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows such a phase diagram ( @xmath76 ) for several values of the soliton contrast .",
    "the circle represents the background intensity @xmath52 and nonlocal soliton solutions are plotted using solid lines .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the same - contrast soliton solution in the purely local case ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the total phase change across the soliton is given by the angle subtended by two lines connecting the origin with points of intersection of the soliton curve and the circle .",
    "one can see directly from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the total phase change across the soliton in a nonlocal medium is always less than in the local case .",

    ", we have studied the properties of bright and dark one - dimensional spatial solitons in a general weakly nonlocal kerr - like medium , in which the change in refractive index due to local and nonlocal contributions are of the same sign .",
    "we have found an exact analytical solution for both bright and dark solitons and used it to find the existence and stability regions of both solutions .",
    "stable bright soliton solutions were found to exist in focusing nonlocal media for all parameter values .",
    "although they were previously predicted the solution was never explicitly written down .",
    "the effect of nonlocality is in some sense equivalent to that of saturation , - to smooth out the index profile and thereby increase the soliton width .",
