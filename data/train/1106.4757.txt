    "there is by now a large body of literature on turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite .",
    "most of this work strives to stay in a limit described by an approximation developed by oberbeck and boussinesq , commonly known as the boussinesq approximation @xcite . within this approximation ,",
    "the material constants are uniform across the layer and the temperature difference between top and bottom boundaries is small compared with the absolute temperature at any point in the layer .",
    "this idealized system has served as a paradigm for more complicated convection problems , as for example atmospheric convection .",
    "a major difference between convection in the boussinesq limit and convection in the atmosphere is that the latter occurs in a layer in which the gas density varies significantly , which implies concomitant variations of viscosity and thermal diffusivity .",
    "experiments on convection beyond the boussinesq approximation have mostly focused on effects caused by the temperature dependence of the material properties @xcite , as opposed to the effects of compressibility .",
    "experiments in low temperature gases near their critical point are to some extent an exception because the parameters in these experiments can be adjusted such that the adiabatic temperature gradient in the gas delays the onset of convection and shifts the critical rayleigh number by a detectable amount @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments were restricted to convection near the onset .",
    "experimental studies aimed at turbulent boussinesq convection in low temperature gases also have to correct for the effect of the adiabatic temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "the present paper investigates through numerical simulation convecting ideal gas in a layer with significant density variation from top to bottom .",
    "no slip top and bottom boundaries are employed , so that the results are in principle amenable to verification by laboratory experiments if one finds a way of realizing similar density gradients in turbulent convection experimentally . the parameters controlling the density variation and the adiabatic temperature gradient",
    "are chosen to scatter around the values of the terrestrial troposphere .",
    "the troposphere is the bottom layer of the atmosphere of approximately 10 km thickness which is well mixed by convection and bounded from above by the stably stratified stratosphere @xcite .",
    "a long standing question in turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection has been how the heat transport across the layer depends on the control parameters .",
    "one goal of the present paper will be to find out whether known results on convection in an incompressible medium can be extended to an ideal gas . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", the scale height of the density profile introduces a new length scale into the problem in addition to the height of the layer .",
    "previous studies @xcite suggest that convective motion extends through multiple scale heights , so that we can not expect that the layer height will simply drop out of the list of the relevant parameters in order to be replaced by the scale height .",
    "another issue peculiar to non - boussinesq convection is the asymmetry between the boundary layers next to the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "for example , the heat conductivities near the warm bottom and cold top boundaries are different , but the heat fluxes through both boundaries are identical in a statistically stationary state , so that the temperature gradients within the top and bottom boundary layers must be different . because of this asymmetry , the temperature in the center of a convection cell does not need to be equal to the arithmetic mean of top and bottom boundary temperatures .",
    "the deviation of the true center temperature from this arithmetic mean has been used in experiments as an indicator of non - boussinesq effects @xcite .",
    "a typical situation in astro- and geophysics is that only part of a convective layer is accessible to observation , at least to accurate observation . for example , the top of planetary or stellar atmospheres and the bottom of earth s troposphere are better known than the rest of the convective layers .",
    "it is in these cases important to know what can be inferred about the convective layer from the observation of some part of it .",
    "translated to the idealized system simulated here , the question arises as to what can be deduced about the whole convective layer or a boundary layer from knowledge of the opposite boundary layer .",
    "the next section will present the mathematical model and the numerical method used to solve it .",
    "the numerical results are analyzed in the third section , in which one subsection deals with the scaling of heat transfer and kinetic energy with the control parameters , whereas another subsection is concerned with the relationship between the boundary layers .",
    "consider a plane layer of height @xmath0 bounded by two planes perpendicular to the @xmath1axis .",
    "gravity @xmath2 is constant and pointing along the negative @xmath1axis , @xmath3 , where the hat denotes a unit vector .",
    "the ideal gas is characterized by constant heat capacities at fixed volume and pressure , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and constant dynamic viscosity @xmath6 and heat conductivity @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the density dependences of kinematic viscosity @xmath8 and thermal diffusivity @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in which @xmath12 is the density .",

    "the meaning of the fifth parameter , @xmath48 , is obvious from the definitions above .",
