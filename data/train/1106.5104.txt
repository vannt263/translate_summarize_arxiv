    "according to the previous works , the nonlinear evolution of the gravitational tidal fields has dual effects .",
    "on the one hand it sharpens the cosmic web and enhances the degree of the large - scale anisotropy by inducing filamentary merging and accretion . on the other hand it diminishes the interconnections between small and large scales by developing secondary filaments and local effects . to explain the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure in the cosmic web",
    ", it is first necessary to understand how the correlation of the tidal fields evolves in a scale dependent way .",
    "the galaxy clusters are the best target for investigating the evolution of the tidal connections between large and small scales . often forming at the intersections of the filaments , the majority of the clusters are not isolated but in constant interactions with the surrounding large scale structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the anisotropic merging of satellites from the surroundings along the major filaments leads to the preferential locations of the satellite galaxies near the minor principal axes of the external tidal fields ( i.e. , the directions of the least compression ) .",

    "we use the semi - analytic galaxy catalogs as well as the halo catalogs at @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the millennium simulation for a @xmath4cdm concordance cosmology with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halos and their substructures in the catalogs were found with the help of the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) and subfind algorithms @xcite , respectively , while the galaxies in the semianalytic catalogs were modeled according to the merger trees derived from the semi- analytic simulations of the galaxy formation @xcite .    for the cluster halos with mass larger than @xmath12 at each redshift , we locate their satellite galaxies from the semi - analytic galaxy catalog and measure the pseudo inertia tensor , @xmath13 , defined in terms of the relative positions of the satellite galaxies located within cluster s virial radius @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the position vector of the @xmath17-th satellite relative to the halo center and @xmath18 is its magnitude .",

    "is determined as the unit eigenvector corresponding to @xmath24 .    using only those satellites located within some radial distance smaller than the cluster s virial radius , @xmath25 , we recalculate the pseudo inertia tensor of each cluster s interior region measured at @xmath26 , @xmath27 diagonalizing @xmath28 and determining its unit eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue , we find the major axis , @xmath29 , at the radial distance @xmath26 , of the interior region of each cluster .",
    "the square of the cosine of the angle between the two major axes is now calculated as @xmath30 for each selected cluster halo .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] illustrates the projected positions of the satellite galaxies in a selected cluster , showing how the alignment angle , @xmath31 , between the distributions of the satellites located within two different radial distances , @xmath14 and @xmath26 is measured .",
    "varying the value of @xmath26 from @xmath32 down to some cutoff radial distance , @xmath33 , defined as the radial distance within which less than five satellites are located , we repeat the whole calculation .    since we are going to relate the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies to the auto - correlations of the tidal fields smoothed on two different top - hat filtering scales ( see  3 ) , we would like to express @xmath34 as a function of the top - hat scale difference rather than the radial difference @xmath35 .",

    "the uncertainties associated with the numerical data points represent the jackknife errors .",
    "we divide the simulation volume into eight subvolumes ( the jackknife resamples ) each of which contains the same number of halos and then measure the alignment profile using the halos from each jackknife resample , separately .",
    "the jackknife errors are finally obtained as the one standard deviation scatter among the eight resamples @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the alignment profile is plotted as a function of @xmath57 rather than @xmath58 ( where @xmath53 is the top - hat filtering scale corresponding to @xmath44 at @xmath54 ) to make a fair comparison of the results from the three samples which must have different values of @xmath53 .",
    "as can be seen , there are clear signals of alignments in the small @xmath58 section , but the alignment profiles drop gradually as @xmath58 increases for all three cases .",
    "the overall amplitude of the alignment profile shows a weak tendency to increase as the cluster s mass increases .",

    "as can be seen , there is a strong tendency that the alignment profiles at higher redshifts drop faster with @xmath58 , which implies that at higher redshifts the satellites in the inner regions of the clusters tend to be less aligned with the external tidal fields .",
    "recalling that what we can readily observe and measure is the two dimensional spatial distributions of the cluster galaxies rather than the three dimensional ones , we also measure the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies in the two - dimensional projected space . adopting the flat - sky approximation and taking the @xmath47-axis as the line - of - sight direction , we project the positions of all satellites onto the @xmath61-@xmath62 plane and follow the exactly same procedures to determine the two dimensional alignment profiles as @xmath63 where the constant term @xmath64 represents the case of no alignment for the two dimensional case .",
    "the left panels of figures [ fig : profile_2 dm ] and [ fig : profile_2dz ] plot the same as the left panels of figures [ fig : profile_3 dm ] and [ fig : profile_3dz ] , respectively , but for the two dimensional case . as can be seen ,",
    "the overall shapes and behaviors of the two dimensional alignment profiles are quite similar to the three dimensional ones except for the decrement of the amplitudes .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that we evaluate the pseudo inertia tensors for the derivation of the cluster galaxy alignment profile ( eqs.[[eqn : inertia_rv]]-[[eqn : inertia_r ] ] ) rather than the conventional mass - weighted ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , given that the pseudo inertia tensors have been found to quantify well the anisotropy in the galaxy spatial distribution caused by the local tidal fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the calculation of the pseudo inertia tensors does not require any information on the satellite masses , the two dimensional alignment profile of the cluster galaxies is indeed a readily measurable quantity . in the following section , we provide physical explanations for",
    "the numerical results obtained here and present an analytic formula for the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies .",
    "assuming that the alignment profiles of satellite galaxies in clusters are directly related to the spatial correlations of the tidal fields , we first measure the alignments between the minor principal axes of the tidal fields smoothed on two different scales , using the numerical data of the millennium density fields constructed on @xmath65 grids . as done in @xcite , we perform the fourier transform of the millennium density field @xmath66 on each grid with the help of the fft ( fast fourier transformation ) method @xcite and calculate the fourier transform of the tidal tensor smoothed on a given scale @xmath53 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the wave vector and @xmath69 is the top - hat window with the filtering radius @xmath53 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of @xmath70 gives the real space tidal field @xmath71 smoothed on the scale of @xmath53 at each pixel point .",
    "the unit eigenvector of @xmath71 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue represents the minor principal axis , @xmath72 .    repeating the whole process but smoothing the tidal field on some smaller scale @xmath73",
    ", we also determine the minor principal axis , @xmath74 , of the tidal field on scale @xmath37 .",
    "the alignment between the minor principal axes of the tidal fields smoothed on two different scales , @xmath37 and @xmath53 , is calculated as @xmath75 at each pixel .",
    "varying the value of @xmath37 , we repeat the whole calculation , average the alignments over @xmath65 pixels and express the alignment profile of the minor axes of the tidal fields as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ fig : tttt ] plots @xmath77 at @xmath54 as open squares with @xmath78mpc .",
    "as can be seen , as @xmath37 decreases , the strength of the alignment gradually decreases .",
    "it was @xcite who have for the first time shown that the auto - correlations between the principal axes of the linear tidal fields smoothed on two different scales can be approximated as a square - root of the density correlation coefficient , @xmath79 , defined as ( see also * ? ? ? * ) @xmath80 adopting the model of @xcite and extending it to the nonlinear regime , we approximate the spatial correlations of the minor principal axes of the nonlinear tidal fields smoothed on the two scales of @xmath53 and @xmath37 as @xmath81^{\\beta } \\xi^{\\beta}(r_{0}-r),\\ ] ] where the power - law index , @xmath82 , is an adjustable parameter . in the original work of @xcite , the linear power spectrum is used for the evaluation of the density correlation coefficient , @xmath79 , through equations ( [ eqn : eta])-([eqn : sr0 ] ) . in our work , however , we redefine @xmath79 in terms of the _ nonlinear _ density power spectrum instead of the linear power spectrum to account for the fact that the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies lie in the nonlinear regime . for the calculation of the nonlinear power spectrum",
    ", we adopt the analytic formula provided by @xcite .    adjusting the value of @xmath82",
    ", we fit the numerical results to equation ( [ eqn : tidal_model ] ) via the standard @xmath83-minimization .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in figure [ fig : tttt ] represent the best - fit models for the cases that the nonlinear and linear density power spectrum are used for the calculation of @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : tttt ] shows that the alignments between the minor principal axes of the tidal fields on different scales are indeed well approximated as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient especially in the large @xmath85 section and that the density correlation coefficient expressed in terms of the nonlinear power spectrum yields a better fit to the numerical results .",
    "the discrepancy between the numerical results and the best - fit analytic curves in the small-@xmath58 section ( @xmath86mpc ) should be attributed to the low - resolution of the millennium tidal fields ( @xmath65 grids on a periodic box of linear size @xmath87mpc ) .    as the alignments between the minor principal axes of the tidal fields on two different scales",
    "are now found to scale as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient , we model the three dimensional alignment profile of cluster galaxies as @xmath88^{n } , a\\xi^{n}(\\delta r),\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath89 and the power - law index @xmath90 are two adjustable parameters , quantifying how strongly the satellites are aligned with the external tidal fields at the virial radius and how fast the alignment profile drops with @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "adjusting the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we fit the numerical results presented in  2 to equation ( [ eqn : profile_model ] ) at each redshift . for the two dimensional case ,",
    "the constant term in equation ( [ eqn : profile_model ] ) is changed from @xmath56 to @xmath64 .",
    "for the fitting model , we use the density correlation coefficient , @xmath91 , expressed in terms of the nonlinear density power spectrum and set the value of @xmath53 at the maximum top - hat scale found from the clusters belonging to each sample .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are determined through minimizing the following generalized @xmath83 @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the difference between the numerical result and the analytic model ( eq.[[eqn : profile_model ] ] ) at the @xmath94-th bin , and @xmath95 is the covariance matrix defined as @xmath96 , where the ensemble average is taken over the eight jackknife resamples ( see  2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath53 for the best - fit analytic model is set at the maximum top - hat scale calculated from the masses of the clusters belonging to each sample .",
    "the best - fit amplitude and power - law index for the three and two dimensional cases are listed in tables [ tab:3d_fit]-[tab:2d_fit ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurement of the best - fit parameter values represent the marginalized errors computed as the curvature of @xmath83 at its minimum @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : profile_3dm]-[fig : profile_2dz ] plot the best - fit models as a function of @xmath97 in the left panels , which reveal that our analytic models ( eq.[[eqn : profile_model ] ] ) are indeed in good agreements with the numerical results for all cases .",
    "we also plot the same alignment profiles versus @xmath91 in the right panels of figures [ fig : profile_3dm]-[fig : profile_2dz ] to show explicitly that the alignment profiles scale as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient .",
    "the fitting results also show qualitatively how the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies change with mass scale and redshift .",
    "as the cluster mass scale increases , the amplitude of the alignment profile increases slightly while its power - law index decreases significantly . as the redshift increases",
    ", the amplitude of the alignment profile shows little change but its power - law index increases considerably .",
    "this result indicates that the satellite galaxies located in the massive clusters at lower redshifts tend to be more strongly aligned on average with the external tidal fields . to test the statistical significance of the dependence of the alignment profile on @xmath98 and @xmath47",
    ", we analyze a simple linear regression of the best - fit values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 listed in tables [ tab:3d_fit]-[tab:2d_fit ] for the three subsamples : ( i , ii , iii ) and ( i , iv , v ) , respectively .",
    "table [ tab : alpha ] which lists the slope , @xmath17 , of each linear model shows quantitatively that the dependences of @xmath90 on @xmath98 and @xmath47 are both significant with @xmath99 while the dependences of @xmath89 on @xmath98 and @xmath47 are insignificant .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath47 can be explained as follows . at higher redshifts , the relative dominance of the dark matter density parameter ,",
    "@xmath100 is greater and thus the nonlinear effect inside the clusters would turn on earlier , resulting in higher degree of the deviation of the major axes of the pseudo inertia tensors of the cluster galaxies from the minor principal axes of the external tidal fields . as for the strong dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath98 ,",
    "the more massive clusters are believed to form more recently and thus their relaxation process has yet to be completed . in consequence , the satellite galaxies of the more massive clusters would retain better memory of the preferential alignments with the minor principal axes of the external tidal fields .",
    "meanwhile , the weak dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath47 and @xmath98 may be interpreted as follows .",
    "the amplitudes of the alignment profiles are largely determined by the degree of the alignments of those satellite galaxies located at the virial radii of their host clusters .",
    "since those satellite are likely to have just merged into the clusters , they should always exhibit the strongest alignments with the external tidal fields , regardless of the redshift and mass scale .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that our model for the alignment profile of cluster galaxies does not require precisely accurate measurement of the cluster s virial radii , given that during the fitting procedure the value of @xmath53 for our model is set at its maximum top - hat scale from the clusters belonging to each sample .",
    "in other words , the alignment profile of cluster galaxies can be constructed even when we have just approximate measurements of virial masses of the sample clusters .",
    "although we have considered only a single cosmological model to measure the alignment profile of cluster galaxies that lies in the non - linear regime , the strong redshift dependence of the alignment profile shown in  3 hints that it might depend on the background cosmology .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the alignment profile scales as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient , @xmath91 , suggests that it might be useful for breaking the @xmath2-@xmath1 degeneracy since @xmath91 is independent of the power spectrum normalization @xmath1 .    to explore this possibility ,",
    "we first examine how the density correlation coefficient , @xmath91 , changes with the matter density parameter . varying the value of @xmath2 from @xmath101 to @xmath102 and fixing the other key cosmological parameters at the values used for the millennium simulations , we repeatedly calculate @xmath91 expressed in terms of the nonlinear power spectrum ( see  3 ) , at @xmath54 ,",
    "the results of which are plotted in the left panel of figure [ fig : probe ] .",
    "it reveals that the higher the value of @xmath2 is , the more rapidly the correlation coefficient @xmath91 drops with @xmath58 .",
    "this result is consistent with our finding in  3 that the alignment profile of cluster galaxies drops faster with @xmath58 at higher redshifts when the relative dominance of dark matter is high .",
    "the other key cosmological parameter that we pay attention to is the neutrino mass , @xmath103 .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated by hydrodynamic simulations that if the neutrinos have non - zero mass ( in a @xmath4cdm+@xmath104 cosmology ) , then their free - streaming would have a strong impact on the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure , suppressing the formation of small- scale objects and thus decreasing the abundance of galaxy clusters and their clustering strength ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "yet , they emphasized that these effect caused by the neutrino free streaming are strongly degenerate with the power spectrum normalization factor , @xmath1 .",
    "it is expected that if there are larger amount of free - streaming neutrinos , then they would defer the merging of the satellite galaxies into the clusters and thus the cluster galaxies would keep better the memory of the external tidal fields .",
    "the higher the fraction of massive neutrinos is , the higher amplitude and lower power - law index the alignment profile of cluster galaxies has . under the speculation that our analytic model for a @xmath4cdm cosmology can be extended to @xmath105cdm cosmology , we calculate @xmath91 for five different cases of the neutrino mass fraction , @xmath106 .",
    "regarding the nonlinear matter density power spectrum for a @xmath4cdm+@xmath104 cosmology , we use the analytic formula provided by @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : probe ] plots the matter density correlation coefficient at @xmath54 for five different cases of @xmath3 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath3 is , the correlation coefficient , @xmath91 , drops less rapidly with @xmath58 , consistent with our expectation .",
    "we have determined the three and two dimensional alignment profiles of cluster galaxies using the halo and semi - analytic galaxy catalogs from the millennium simulation .",
    "the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies are defined as the average alignments between the major axes of the pseudo inertia tensors of the cluster galaxies on two different top - hat scales @xmath53 and @xmath37 ( where @xmath53 is the top - hat radius enclosing cluster s virial mass and @xmath107 ) .",
    "the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies reflect how well the satellite galaxies , after merging into the clusters , retain the memory of the preferential alignments with the minor principal axes of the external tidal fields and how fast they gradually lose the alignment tendency under the influence of the internal tidal fields as the cluster s relaxation proceeds and nonlinear effect becomes stronger .",
    "it has been shown that the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies expressed as a function of @xmath108 behave as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient .",
    "the alignment profiles exhibit weak dependence of the amplitude @xmath89 on mass scale and redshift but strong dependence of the power - law index @xmath90 whose statistical significance is tested by using a simple linear regression analysis . as the cluster mass decreases and the redshift increases , the alignment profile drops faster with @xmath58 , which is consistent with the scenario that the faster merging process of the satellites and earlier onset of the nonlinear effect inside the clusters tend to break more easily the preferential alignments of the cluster galaxies with the minor principal axes of the external tidal fields .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath89 on mass scale and redshift implies that the satellite galaxies located at the virial radii of their host clusters always keep good memory of the external tidal fields regardless of the mass scale and redshift .",
    "we have suggested that the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies might be a complimentary cosmological probe , being useful especially for breaking the @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath3-@xmath1 degeneracies ( where @xmath3 is the neutrino mass fraction ) owing to the insensitivity of @xmath91 to @xmath1 .",
    "to prove this theoretical concept , however , it will be necessary to test the validity of our model against n - body simulations for different cosmologies other than the @xmath4cdm model assumed for the millennium simulations . as a large catalog of the galaxy clusters and their satellites from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 is in the pipeline @xcite , our future work is in the direction of conducting numerical and observational tests of the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies presented here .",

    "<S> analyzing the halo and galaxy catalogs from the millennium simulations at redshifts @xmath0 , we determine the alignment profiles of cluster galaxies by measuring the average alignments between the major axes of the pseudo inertia tensors from all satellites within cluster s virial radius and from only those satellites within some smaller radius as a function of the top - hat scale difference . </S>",
    "<S> the alignment profiles quantify how well the satellite galaxies retain the memory of the external tidal fields after merging into their host clusters and how fast they lose the initial alignment tendency as the cluster s relaxation proceeds . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the alignment profile drops faster at higher redshifts and on smaller mass scales . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the picture that the faster merging of the satellites and earlier onset of the nonlinear effect inside clusters tend to break the preferential alignments of the satellites with the external tidal fields . </S>",
    "<S> modeling the alignment profile of cluster galaxies as a power - law of the density correlation coefficient that is independent of the power spectrum normalization ( @xmath1 ) and demonstrating that the density correlation coefficient varies sensitively with the density parameter ( @xmath2 ) and neutrino mass fraction ( @xmath3 ) , we suggest that the alignment profile of cluster galaxies might be useful for breaking the @xmath2-@xmath1 and @xmath3-@xmath1 degeneracies . </S>"
