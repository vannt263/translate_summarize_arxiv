    "nonlinear dynamical systems with invariant subspaces forced by , for example , symmetries or other constraints are of great physical interest .",
    "the dynamics on such invariant subspaces can show transverse stability or instability depending on whether small perturbations away from the subspace decay or grow with time .",
    "as these subspaces need not be normally hyperbolic , the dynamics near them can be very complicated ; for example , the phenomena of riddled basins is typical in such systems .",
    "recently there have been concerted attempts to understand the bifurcations of such attractors on varying a parameter in the system . for system parameters that are _ normal _",
    "@xcite i.e. parameters that leave the system on the invariant manifold unchanged , there is a good description of the instability that causes a blowout bifurcation ; this is a linear instability that can be computed by examining the lyapunov exponents ( le ) corresponding to perturbations in transverse directions .",
    "the problem of characterising the global branching in such bifurcations is still not understood , but some progress has been made in @xcite .    in reality , most physically relevant parameters are not normal ; that is , they vary the dynamics within the invariant subspace as well as that outside it .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that most physically relevant chaos is not structurally stable ( it is _ fragile _ in the terminology of ) , and the fact that most systems do not possess a skew product nature , leads to a variety of novel and physically relevant phenomena that we investigate in this paper .",
    "these include    1 .",
    "`` blurring '' of a blowout bifurcation caused by the breakup of fragile chaos .",
    "2 .   windows within parameter space where a generalised type of on - off intermittency ( which we call `` in - out '' intermittency ) may appear .",
    "3 .   new mechanisms for bifurcation to locally riddled basins , including cases where the attractor in the invariant subspace is not chaotic .",
    "all of these phenomena arise on varying parameters that are not normal in systems that are fragile and do not have skew product form .",
    "more precisely , consider a family of smooth mappings @xmath0 parametrised smoothly by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a compact subset of @xmath3 with open interior , such that @xmath4 leaves a linear subspace @xmath5 invariant .",
    "if the map @xmath6 , restricted to @xmath7 , is independent of @xmath8 we say that @xmath8 is a _ normal parameter _ for @xmath9 on @xmath7 , otherwise we say @xmath8 is a _ non - normal parameter_.    if a ( minimal milnor ) attractor @xmath10 becomes transversely unstable on varying a parameter @xmath8 we call this a _ blowout bifurcation_. for normal parameters this can happen at isolated values of @xmath8 ; we will show that for non - normal parameters a more typical scenario is the _ blurred blowout bifurcation _",
    ", where blowouts can accumulate on themselves and can even occur on a positive measure subset of parameters . in practice ,",
    "a blurred blowout is recognisable as a complicated pattern of inflating and collapsing of the basins of attraction of a family of attractors within @xmath7 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath11 is a chaotic attractor for @xmath9 at some particular parameter value , and @xmath12 .",
    "suppose moreover that @xmath13 is non - empty and so there are trajectories in @xmath11 that get arbitrarily close to @xmath7 but also a finite distance from @xmath7 , arbitrarily many times . in the case",
    "that @xmath14 is a ( minimal ) attractor for @xmath15 , we say that @xmath11 displays on - off intermittency to the attractor @xmath14 in @xmath7 .",
    "the attractor @xmath11 is _ stuck on _",
    "@xcite to @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "we will see that in general , although @xmath14 is an attractor , it need not be a minimal attractor for @xmath15 ; in this case we have `` transversely attracting '' and `` transversely repelling '' invariant subsets within @xmath14 ; this more general case we refer to as _ in - out _ intermittency .",
    "if we have an in - out intermittent state that is not on - off , then a minimal attractor for @xmath15 is a proper subset of @xmath14 ; these can be , for example , stable periodic orbits within @xmath7 .",
    "this form of intermittency manifests itself as an attractor where trajectories show long periods close to @xmath7 shadowing orbits in @xmath14 , alternating with short bursting phases that may or may not be transient .",
    "in particular the `` growing '' and the `` decaying '' phases can happen via different mechanisms within the invariant subspace ; in particular , _ only the phases where the trajectory moves away from @xmath7 remain close to an attractor within @xmath7_.    this sort of intermittency is a truly global phenomenon in that it _ can not _ appear in systems with skew - product structure , even if they show blowout bifurcations etc . since most systems with invariant subspaces do not have skew - product structure , we therefore believe that in - out intermittency will be commonly observable .",
    "we discuss in section  [ secmodel ] a simple model mapping of the plane with a non - normal parameter .",
    "this mapping can be analysed fairly comprehensively , both numerically and theoretically .",
    "it can be shown to demonstrate all of the above ( and many more ) phenomena . in section  [ sectheory ]",
    "we put forward arguments to show that the observed behaviour of the map in section [ secmodel ] is in fact typical .",
    "essential to our arguments are the use of lyapunov exponents ( les ) , minimal milnor attractors , fragility of chaotic attractors and the lack of a skew product structure .",
    "section  [ secinout ] discusses and characterises in - out intermittency in more detail , and shows that the essential features of this behaviour are well - modelled by a markov map .",
    "this map has two parameters that can be used to characterise the intermittency .",
    "we define a ratio @xmath16 of time spent in the `` in '' and `` out '' phases . in the limit of @xmath17",
    "we regain on - off intermittency .",
    "this quantity is an invariant of the intermittent dynamics up to conjugacy .",
    "next , section  [ secbifs ] examines other bifurcation effects that appear in systems on varying non - normal parameters ; notably we find a new route to creation of a riddled basin via a `` non - normal '' riddling bifurcation that may well be more common than that described in .",
    "finally in section [ secdiscuss ] we discuss our results and point out similar behaviour that has previously been found in both ordinary and partial differential equation models .",
    "the model we consider extends the well - known logistic map to a mapping of the plane @xmath18 this has five parameters @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 and it displays a wide variety of bifurcation behaviour .",
    "we can view this as a map of @xmath21 to itself that leaves @xmath22 invariant ( in fact for arbitrary parameter values most orbits diverge to infinity .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath23 there is a compact subset of initial conditions containing @xmath7 that remains bounded ) .",
    "the map on @xmath7 is the well - known logistic map and it undergoes the familiar routes to chaos via intermittency and period - doubling cascades .    in the case",
    "@xmath24 , the map has extra structure ; it is a _ skew product _ over the dynamics in @xmath25 , i.e.  it can be written as @xmath26 for some @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "we will see that the breaking of the skew product form ( @xmath30 ) is important to see the generic types of dynamics we report here .    if we fix @xmath31 and vary @xmath32 , @xmath8 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 we see that the latter four parameters do not affect the map restricted to @xmath7 ; i.e.  @xmath32 , @xmath8 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are _ normal parameters _ for the system restricted to @xmath7 .",
    "we are especially interested in the case where these parameters are fixed and the only _ non - normal parameter _",
    "@xmath31 is varied . in this case",
    "the dynamics in @xmath7 will undergo many bifurcations in regions of interest .",
    "we investigate the relationship between the dynamics and the numerically measured les ; these are defined as usual for @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath37 where this limit exists @xcite ; in section  [ sectheory ] we will return to explain the dynamical behaviour in terms of these rates of asymptotic separation of trajectories .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath38 measures the exponential rate of growth of perturbations in the direction @xmath39 along the orbit of @xmath40 ; typically there will be two distinct lyapunov exponents .",
    "if @xmath41 , i.e.  @xmath42 then we can classify the le into two cases : the _ tangential _",
    "le @xmath43 and the _ transverse _",
    "le @xmath44 for some @xmath39 such that @xmath45 .",
    "( note that it may be the case that @xmath46 for almost all @xmath39 ; however if it is different for one value of @xmath39 this is @xmath47 ) .      to get a qualitative understanding of the dynamics possible in non ",
    "normal , fragile and skew product settings , we numerically calculated a number of dynamical indicators for the system ( [ eqmap ] ) over a range of control parameters in order to investigate the corresponding attractors and their relationship to the invariant subspace @xmath7 .",
    "we now summarise some of the most interesting types of new behaviour we have observed .",
    "figure [ figliapscan ] shows the numerically computed les , for the full system ( [ eqmap ] ) as well as the le corresponding to the map @xmath48 restricted to @xmath7 and the transverse le , @xmath49 , as a function of the parameter @xmath31 . in the top panel",
    "we have marked by 1 and 2 two different regions where there are `` blowout '' bifurcations .",
    "we show in figure [ figatts1 ] typical attractors of system ( [ eqmap ] ) with parameter values in these regions for some initial conditions .",
    "( a )    ( b )    we have also calculated in each case the average distances and maximum distance of typical trajectories from @xmath7 and les after transients have been allowed to die away .",
    "these are shown in figures  [ figscan ] and [ figscanblur ] .",
    "the regime 1 corresponding to @xmath50 is brought about by a saddle - node going to a stable period @xmath51 orbit in @xmath7 that breaks down to chaos on reducing @xmath31 via saddle - node induced intermittency .",
    "the regime 2 located near @xmath52 seems to have attractors that barely vary their statistics .    in both cases",
    "the blowout is observable over a small range of @xmath31 .",
    "as shown in figures  [ figscan](d ) and [ figscanblur](d ) , the transverse le appears to vary non - differentially over a large measure set of @xmath31 .",
    "we suppose that these show essentially the same phenomenon , with just a different measure set of points where ` blowout ' bifurcations occur .",
    "finally , figure [ figscan2dim ] shows the boundaries of the regions in the 2dimensional @xmath53 parameter space for which the attractor in @xmath7 is transversely stable ( unstable ) .",
    "note how there are two regions in this parameter space ; one in which there is an attractor contained in the invariant subspace and another where there is not .",
    "the boundary between the two takes the form of a graph over @xmath31 .",
    "this is because @xmath8 is a normal parameter and so for a given attractor in @xmath7 this varies the normal le smoothly through zero .",
    "the lack of normality of @xmath31 means that the variation is much more complicated in this direction .",
    "these numerical computations demonstrate a number of important features of the blowout bifurcations observed here , notably :    * there are oscillations through zero of the transverse lyapunov exponent of the attractor for the map @xmath28 .",
    "* the set of parameter values where the tangential le is positive ( corresponding to a chaotic attractor for @xmath28 ) are interrupted by a large number of intervals where the le is negative and the dynamics is periodic . * the minimum distance from @xmath7",
    "is always observed to be exactly ( or very close to ) zero , implying that all attractors are `` stuck on '' to @xmath7 if they are not actually within @xmath7 .",
    "on the basis of results in the next section , we conjecture that there is in fact a positive measure set of @xmath31 that correspond to blowout bifurcations in some sense .",
    "( a )    ( b )    figure  [ figinoutonoff ] shows two examples of intermittent - type behaviour for the system ( [ eqmap ] ) , involving an attractor that is not in @xmath7 but which contains points arbitrary close to @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ figinoutonoff](a ) shows an example of the well - known on - off intermittency ; while figure  [ figinoutonoff](b ) shows an example of a related intermittency ( in - out intermittency ) where the attractor in @xmath7 is much smaller than the attractor for the full system intersected with @xmath7 . in the latter case ,",
    "the statistics of the attractor on @xmath7 are markedly different from the statistics of the attractor for the full system near @xmath7 .",
    "this is reflected by the `` windows '' of periodic behaviour in the @xmath25 dynamics when @xmath54 is small and growing exponentially over several orders of magnitude .",
    "section [ secinout ] presents a theoretical analysis and characterisation of this type of intermittent behaviour .",
    "suppose there is a minimal attractor @xmath10 with a ( locally ) riddled basin that is fragile . on varying a non - normal parameter it is possible for this to collapse onto a stable periodic orbit within @xmath7 under arbitrarily small perturbations .",
    "if the periodic orbit is linearly stable we can infer that its basin of attraction has open interior and so upon variation of a non - normal parameter we can get transitions from open basins to and from riddled basins in a very natural way .",
    "this transition to riddled basins will in general be `` blurred '' as with the blowout bifurcation .",
    "figure [ fignnriddle ] shows an example of basins of attraction of attractors within @xmath7 computed for the map ( [ eqmap ] ) at two different but close values of @xmath31 . in one case",
    "the attractor in @xmath7 is periodic and in the other a chaotic attractor in @xmath7 with a riddled basin . between these two values",
    "there will be a non - normal riddling bifurcation ( or more precisely , a set of such bifurcations ) .",

    "_ on the parameter dependence of chaotic attractors .",
    "barreto _ et al . _",
    "consider a class of chaotic attractors that are _ fragile _",
    ", i.e.  attractors that are not structurally stable under perturbations , but that nonetheless persist for a large measure of nearby parameter values .",
    "such attractors are thought to be present in a large number of physically important systems .",
    "more precisely , barreto _ et al .",
    "_ suppose that a mapping @xmath28 has a chaotic attractor @xmath11 possessing @xmath55 positive les .",
    "suppose that @xmath56 is a mapping that is @xmath57 close to @xmath28 and such that almost all points in a neighbourhood of @xmath11 are attracted to periodic orbits .",
    "then they say @xmath11 is _ dispelled _ for @xmath56 .",
    "they define the attractor @xmath11 as being _ fragile _ if @xmath11 is dispelled for @xmath57-arbitrarily close @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , their main conjecture ( the _ windows conjecture _ ) for one parameter and one positive le , suggests that there will be a dense set of nearby parameter values at which the attractors are periodic .",
    "this set of parameter values is called the _",
    "windows set_.    for the model ( [ eqmap ] ) that we consider , there are two deep results about the logistic map that mean that the chaotic attractors of the map on @xmath7 are really fragile in the above sense .",
    "namely :    ( see ) [ thmlogistic ] consider the mapping @xmath58 from @xmath59 $ ] to itself .",

    "the basic result of oseledec s theorem @xcite is that les exist and take a finite number of constant values on a set of full @xmath8-measure for any ergodic @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath11 has a natural measure as well as singular measures we say the attractor is _ chaotic _ and the les to almost all initial points are given by those for the natural measure ; however the convergence is non - uniform and shows arbitrarily long deviations towards the les for any singular measure for @xmath11 .",
    "this causes riddling and several other phenomena associated with chaotic behaviour in an invariant subspace .",
    "as shown , for example , in , for a large class of attractors one can classify an attractor in an invariant subspace according to its transverse les according to where zero lies relative to this spectrum .",
    "suppose that @xmath79 is a family of natural measures of attractors for @xmath80 and define @xmath81 the most positive transverse le for the natural measure at @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath82 is an attractor for @xmath4 if @xmath83 .",
    "it is not an attractor if @xmath84 .",
    "parameter values @xmath85 where @xmath49 takes both signs for @xmath8 arbitrarily close to @xmath85 we refer to as _ blowout points _ of @xmath86 and these govern the bifurcation from the invariant subspace .      the transverse les can be thought of as the characteristic exponents for the linear skew product system @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a normal derivative at @xmath25 ; i.e.  such that @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes some matrix function of @xmath25 . if we consider such a system perturbed by normal parameters , the transverse les are simply those of a perturbed cocycle and so in particular they can vary continuously with any normal parameter ( more precisely , they will vary continuously on a generic set of perturbed systems ) .",
    "if the les do vary continuously then in particular @xmath49 will vary continuously and even @xmath91 generically for @xmath92 ; thus we can see that ( at least within an open set of smooth systems ) , generically the set of blowout points has codimension one in parameter space .",
    "on one side of such a normal blowout , @xmath86 is an attractor for @xmath4 ; on the other side it is not .",
    "when @xmath86 loses stability it may give rise to a branch of on - off intermittent attractors ( non - hysteretic or supercritical scenario ) , or there may be no nearby attractors ( hysteretic or subcritical scenario ) , as discussed by ott & sommerer ( although there are further possibilities , as discussed in ) .",
    "note that the hysteretic scenario may give rise to transient on - off intermittent behaviour near blowout .      if we do not have normal parameters and have fragile chaos in the invariant subspace , the attractors @xmath86 will typically collapse over some dense set of windows and consequently @xmath93 will typically not vary continuously .    as @xmath94",
    "does not vary continuously we can not apply any intermediate value theorem and so it is possible to pass from @xmath95 to @xmath96 without passing through zero .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath97 and the _ blowout set _ to be @xmath98 for normal parameters , this is equivalent to the set of blowout bifurcations .",
    "the numerical evidence of section  [ secmodel ] suggests that @xmath99 can be a fractal : more precisely we can use theorem  [ thmlogistic ] to show the following .",
    "there is a map of the form ( [ eqmap ] ) whose blowout set @xmath99 has positive lebesgue measure in parameter space .",
    "* proof : * consider any map that has linear form @xmath100 near the invariant subspace @xmath42 .",
    "this is such that the tangential and the transverse les are the same for all @xmath33 . on varying the non - normal @xmath33 , it is possible to see that @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the notation of theorem  [ thmlogistic ] ; the conclusions of this theorem imply that @xmath103 and consequently the blowout set has positive lebesgue measure .",
    "qed    in the more general case of @xmath11 being an attractor that is stuck on to @xmath7 with @xmath13 fragile then we conjecture that there are typically positive measure blowout sets at loss of transverse stability .",
    "if @xmath14 is not fragile but instead structurally stable ( e.g. if it is uniformly hyperbolic ) then the blowout set has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "however , even in the case of a positive measure blowout set , the sparcity of windows may mean that they are very difficult to observe even in a region where they exist .",
    "we now turn to a static ( i.e.  non - bifurcation ) effect that is associated with the blurred blowout . in particular , we characterise a generalised form of on - off intermittency that we refer to as in - out intermittency .",
    "this includes forms of on - off intermittency where the attracting dynamics within the invariant subspace does not need to be chaotic .    in the following",

    "the bifurcation to riddling ( and associated bifurcation to bubbling ) has been discussed in detail by , in the case where a normal parameter is varied .    in this section",
    "we can see how basin riddling can appear on varying a non - normal parameter ; this occurs via a breakdown of fragile chaos of an attractor within the invariant subspace .",
    "if we vary a non - normal parameter we expect riddled basins to typically appear and disappear in the following way ;    suppose there is a @xmath85 such that    * there is a branch of attracting periodic orbits ( or more generally , uniquely ergodic attractors @xmath234 for @xmath235 ) .",
    "* there is a large measure subset of @xmath236 where there exist a branch of attractors @xmath237 such that @xmath238 are in a neighbourhood of the @xmath239 and the basins of the @xmath239 are locally riddled .",
    "then we say there is a _ non - normal bifurcation to riddling _ at @xmath85 .",
    "note that ( b ) holds if there is a transversely unstable measure supported on @xmath239 , subject to certain regularity conditions .",
    "some of these transversely unstable measures will continue through the bifurcation to give rise to complicated repelling sets for @xmath235 .",
    "we expect this new bifurcation is in fact a more typical way to create riddled basins on varying a non - normal parameter than the normal parameter scenario discussed in .",
    "an example of the basins of attraction before and after such a bifurcation is shown in figure [ fignnriddle ] .",
    "there are many other bifurcations that have been studied in the case of normal parameters and which will carry across to non - normal parameter systems , modulo the fact that if the chaotic invariant set in @xmath7 is fragile then these transitions will happen on sets that may be considerably large than codimension one .",
    "for example , the transition to bubbling , an attractor becoming unstuck @xcite and a transition to cycling chaos may all appear in a non - normal setting .",
    "moreover , the case @xmath240 in the markov model for in - out intermittency will correspond to a transition from on - off to in - out intermittency .",
    "the motivation for this paper came from previous work of the authors that investigated a truncated pde model of an axisymmetric mean field dynamo model .",
    "bifurcation and dynamical effects came to light that did not fit into the usual setting of a blowout bifurcation ; this led us to consider these effects in the simple mapping ( [ eqmap ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we have addressed two main questions ; firstly , what happens to a blowout bifurcation in non - skew product systems on varying the dynamics by a non  normal parameter within the invariant subspace and secondly , how to characterise the dynamics of what we call `` in - out '' intermittency which we suggest should be a commonly observable type of dynamics in realistic models with invariant subspaces .",
    "we have also raised a number of other questions relating to riddling and other bifurcations and discussed these in passing .",
    "we have tried to give a general characterisation of in - out intermittency , have contrasted it to on  off intermittency and have related its likelihood to the non  skew product nature of the system and the non  normal nature of its parameters .",
    "we have proposed that this type of behaviour can be well modelled by a simple markov chain and have used this to obtain quantitative measures of this state ( notably the ratio @xmath16 of `` in''- to `` out''- states , which is a dynamical invariant ) .",
    "an important signature of in  out intermittency is the presence of intervals with exponential growth in the `` out '' variables with a constant rate , over many orders of magnitude .",
    "while this occurs , the `` in '' variables closely shadow the periodic attractor in the invariant submanifold , thus giving a clear distinction from on  off intermittency where the on and off phases are not so clearly differentiated .",
    "we shall show in a future publication that in  out intermittency can account for the behaviour observed in the study of mean field dynamo models ( modelled on partial differential equations ) and referred to as `` icicle '' intermittency by brooke @xcite , who uses a skew product model to investigate this ( see also tworkowski _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and brooke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) as well as in the truncated versions of related models by the authors . similarly",
    "this type of behaviour is related to the `` new type of intermittency '' reported by hasegawa _",
    "_ in a ring of phase - locked loops .",
    "there are still few rigorous results on what has been called `` fragile chaos '' .",
