    "_ fullerenes _ are carbon - cage molecules comprised of carbon atoms that are arranged on a sphere with twelve pentagon - faces and other hexagon - faces .",

    "@xcite . since the discovery of the first fullerene molecule , the fullerenes have been objects of interest to scientists in many disciplines .",
    "many properties of fullerene molecules can be studied using mathematical tools and results .",
    "thus , _ fullerene graphs _ were defined as cubic ( i.e.  @xmath6-regular ) planar 3-connected graphs with pentagonal and hexagonal faces .",

    "the hamiltonicity of planar 3-connected cubic graph has been attracting much interest of mathematicians since tait  @xcite in 1878 gave a short and elegant ( but also false ) proof of the four color theorem based on the `` fact '' that planar 3-connected cubic graphs are hamiltonian .",
    "the missing detail of the proof was precisely the previously mentioned `` fact '' which became known as tait s conjecture .",
    "later , tutte  @xcite disproved tait s conjecture .",
    "the hamiltonicity of various subclasses of 3-connected planar cubic graphs was additionally investigated .",
    "grnbaum and zaks  @xcite asked whether the graphs in the family @xmath9 of 3-connected cubic planar graphs whose faces are of size @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 are hamiltonian for any @xmath13 .",
