    "trapped bose - einstein condensed gases provide a novel kind of condensed matter system which can sustain quantized vortices , as has been realized in the recent years @xcite .",
    "features which differ from those in macroscopic superfluid systems are expected here .",
    "the fact that these systems are finite , and that the parameter regime where the vortex core size is comparable to the system size is attainable , in principle opens up for the possibility for vortices in these systems to have a circulation quantum number @xmath0 larger than unity .",
    "it is well known that multiply quantized vortices are not thermodynamically stable in spinless , macroscopic and homogeneous superfluids , because the energy of a vortex depends on the square of the circulation , and therefore two singly quantized vortices with a finite spatial separation have lower energy than one doubly quantized , while giving the system the same angular momentum @xcite . however , multiply quantized vortices may well be energetically favorable in systems which do not fulfill the criteria of being homogeneous , spinless and macroscopic .",
    "the assumption of homogeneity is not met in superconductors with pinning forces , where indeed doubly quantized vortices are observed @xcite . in @xmath1he - a , where the order parameter is not a scalar due to spin degrees of freedom , a lattice of doubly quantized vortices with filled cores has recently been observed @xcite .",
    "the argument also fails in spatially confined systems where the vortex cores are not much smaller than the system , such as mesoscopic superconducting disks , where vortices with large quantum numbers have been predicted @xcite .    in condensed bose gases confined in harmonic - oscillator potentials",
    ", it has been found both analytically @xcite , numerically @xcite and variationally @xcite that multiply quantized vortices are not energetically favorable , and no quantum numbers larger than unity have been observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , none of these studies has considered whether altering the power law of the confining potential can open up for the existence of multiply quantized vortices . in this paper",
    ", we shall give rigorous criteria for the thermodynamic stability of multiply quantized vortices in trapped bose - einstein condensates , and show the decisive role played by the shape of the potential .",
    "the system under study is a gas of bosons of mass @xmath2 in an external potential @xmath3 , dilute enough and at sufficiently low temperature that it is well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath4 the so - called condensate wave function @xmath5 is normalized to the number of particles @xmath6 in three dimensions , and to the number of particles @xmath7 per unit length in two dimensions .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 in front of the nonlinear term is the interaction strength , defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the s - wave scattering length .",
    "it turns out that the effective measure of interaction strength in two dimensions is the product @xmath11 , which we shall denote by @xmath12 . in three dimensions the corresponding quantity depends on the trapping potential .",
    "a centrifugal term is present in the gross - pitaevskii equation , corresponding to a rotation of the trap with the frequency @xmath13 about the @xmath14 axis . at certain critical values @xmath15 of the rotation frequency",
    ", we expect there to be a discrete transition between states of different circulation numbers , so that when @xmath16 , a state with total circulation quantum number @xmath0 is the ground state @xcite",
    ". the critical frequencies are functions of the coupling strength @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "when the gross - pitaevskii equation is valid , the total energy of the system is given by the mean - field energy functional @xmath17    we shall in the following be concerned with the lowest - energy solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpe ] ) for a range of values of the driving frequency @xmath13 , interaction strength @xmath8 and for different external potentials @xmath18 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ analysissec ]",
    ", we present an analytic study of systems contained in three- and two - dimensional power - law and anharmonic traps . in sec .",
    "[ numsec ] , we illustrate these findings numerically for the two - dimensional case and study some features of the different states with small and intermediate circulation quantum numbers . sec .",
    "[ conclusionsec ] provides a conclusion .",
    "consider a bose gas trapped in a cylindrically symmetric power - law potential of power @xmath19 , which in cylindrical coordinates is written @xmath20 the trap frequency @xmath21 , which determines the strength of the potential , defines a trap length @xmath22 .",
    "the dependence of the potential on the @xmath14 coordinate is totally arbitrary as long as the problem remains separable in the noninteracting limit , as is the case here .",
    "we shall hereafter neglect to mention the irrelevant @xmath14-dependent term and its associated degrees of freedom .    in the analysis of this section",
    ", we shall consider the weakly - interacting limit where @xmath8 is small , because if a multiply quantized vortex can ever be present , it will be so when the interaction is weak . to see why , note that the vortex cores are large for weak interactions and vice versa @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the limit of large @xmath8 , the vortices are much smaller than the system size and the radius of curvature of the density profile .",
    "the result of a homogeneous bulk system thus applies , namely that a vortex array is the energetically favorable configuration .",
    "therefore , we expect multiply quantized vortices to show up only in the realm of small ( and possibly intermediate ) @xmath8 .    ref .",
    "@xcite showed why multiply quantized vortices are never the minimum - energy state in a system which is harmonically confined in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane .",
    "we will here extend the same analysis to the case when the confinement is steeper than harmonic .",
    "the argument is based on perturbative treatment of the interaction term in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "we therefore first study the noninteracting gas .",
    "when @xmath25 , the gross - pitaevskii equation is identical to the one - particle schrdinger equation , whose solutions are well known when the radial confinement is harmonic .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath26 can be labeled by a radial and an axial quantum number @xmath27 and @xmath0 ( as well as a quantum number associated with the @xmath14 direction , irrelevant for our considerations ) .",
    "the eigenenergies including the centrifugal term are @xmath28 we shall concentrate on the states with no radial nodes , @xmath29 , because these have the lowest energy for a given angular momentum @xmath30 .",
    "these are in fact vortices with quantum number @xmath0 . when the driving frequency @xmath13 is less than the trap frequency @xmath21 , the @xmath31 state is the ground state ; when @xmath32 , all the states @xmath29 are degenerate .",
    "when @xmath33 , @xmath34 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , and there is no ground state .",
    "hence , in the noninteracting case all the critical frequencies @xmath15 are equal to the trap frequency @xmath21 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we now consider perturbatively the interaction energy .",
    "the perturbation for a given wave function @xmath35 is , from eq .",
    "( [ gpenergy ] ) , @xmath36 calculating this for general superpositions @xmath37 , we find that the degeneracy at @xmath32 is lifted , and the critical frequencies @xmath15 split apart and assume values less than @xmath21 .",
    "fixing a total angular momentum @xmath38 , it turns out that wave functions which are superpositions of states of different @xmath0 have less interaction energy than the pure multiply - quantized vortex configurations @xmath29 for @xmath39 .",
    "such superpositions are vortex arrays , and these are the energetically favorable states for any finite interaction strength",
    ".    we shall now show how the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite works when the trapping power @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ trap ] ) is larger than two . in this case ,",
    "the single - particle energy varies faster than linear with the angular momentum .",
    "this implies that in the noninteracting case , pure multiply - quantized vortex states @xmath29 have lower energy than any superposition having the same angular momentum .",
    "hence , it takes a finite ( albeit possibly very small ) interaction strength @xmath8 to overcome this difference .",
    "we stress that in order to arrive at this result , we did not need to know any details of the eigenfunctions of a general power - law potential : the fact that the energy depends stronger than linearly on the angular momentum is enough . for a finite but weak enough interaction ,",
    "the multiply - quantized vortex states are the minimum - energy configurations within their respective ranges of external rotation frequency @xmath13 .",
    "when the interaction is strong enough , however , the larger interaction energy of the multiply - quantized vortex states will overcome the difference in kinetic plus trap energy , and the ground state will again be a vortex array .",
    "this makes sense , since as we noted above , in the limit of strong interaction the results of the infinite and homogeneous case apply .    for potentials weaker than harmonic , @xmath40 ,",
    "no rotation is possible .",
    "the potential in a frame rotating with angular frequency @xmath13 is @xmath41 , which is not confining if @xmath42 and @xmath3 is weaker than harmonic .",
    "therefore a rotating state in such a trap can be at most metastable .",
    "@xcite    if a pure power - law potential which is steeper than harmonic may seem an artificial construction which is hard to fabricate in practice , we note that the analysis can be repeated for an anharmonic potential , @xmath43 the important point is that for any positive anharmonicity @xmath44 , the single - particle energy varies faster than linear with the angular momentum .",
    "this again leads to the conclusion that multiply quantized vortices can exist in anharmonic traps as long as @xmath45 and the coupling is small .",
    "we have shown that multiply quantized vortices can be stable only in trapping potentials which are steeper than harmonic in the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane , and only for weak enough interactions .",
    "a close inspection of the above argument reveals the physical mechanism behind the transition .",
    "the kinetic energy gives rise to a repulsion between the vortices because of the overlapping velocity fields , while the trapping potential strives to keep the vortices together in order to reduce the spatial extent of the cloud .",
    "the interaction energy favors states with several separated vortices because such states have lower density on the average .",
    "the thermodynamic stability of multiply quantized vortices is thus a consequence of the competition between these three energies , and the power 2 is the limiting value .",
    "we now perform a numerical study to quantify the predictions of section [ analysissec ] .",
    "we shall treat the two - dimensional case only .",
    "we insert the power - law potential , eq.([trap ] ) , into the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpe ] ) and scale out the dimensions by defining @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and for the total mean - field energy @xmath52 .",
    "there results a dimensionless gross - pitaevskii equation , @xmath53 which depends on three parameters , namely the coupling @xmath12 , the rotation frequency @xmath54 , and the trapping power @xmath19 .",
    "we solve it in two dimensions using the split fourier method @xcite . by propagating eq .",
    "( [ dimlessgpe ] ) in complex time , the system relaxes to a local energy minimum which depends on the initial state . in order to find the _",
    "global _ minimum - energy configuration for each choice of parameters @xmath12 , @xmath54 , @xmath19 , we perform the relaxation a few times using different , irregular initial states , compute their energy with the aid of eq .",
    "( [ gpenergy ] ) , and out of the different final states we choose that which has the lowest energy .",
    "the grid size is @xmath55 points , and the lattice constant is equal to 0.2 times the trap length @xmath56 .",
    "we have confirmed that doubling the grid size and halving the lattice constant does not alter the results .",
    "figure [ phdiag4 ] is a phase diagram for the quartic potential ( @xmath57 ) , which shows how the @xmath54-@xmath12 plane is divided into regions of different vortex configurations with the total circulation @xmath0 ranging from 1 up to 4 .",
    "the different vortex configurations are labelled by the total number of quanta followed by the number of singularities present in the system : the configuration 3 - 3 thus denotes three @xmath58 vortices whereas 3 - 1 is a state with one triply quantized vortex present .",
    "the region marked by 0 is the nonrotating state .",
    "phase diagram for a quartically confined two - dimensional bose gas subject to a force rotating with an angular frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the state marked by 0 is the nonrotating state , and 1 - 1 is a state with one central @xmath58 vortex .",
    "the regions 2 - 2 , 3 - 3 and 4 - 4 denote vortex lattices containing two , three and four singly quantized vortices , respectively , while the states 2 - 1 , 3 - 1 and 4 - 1 are states with several quanta of circulation but only one phase singularity . ]    since the numerical computation is done with limited precision , we need an operational criterion for the existence of a multiply quantized vortex .",
    "a @xmath0-fold quantized vortex is defined as a configuration in which the calculated circulation around a circle enclosing the origin is equal to @xmath0 and only one density minimum can be seen on optical inspection of the plotted wave function , i.  e.  the inter - vortex distance is less than the lattice constant of the numerical grid .",
    "the transition frequencies found using this criterion coincides with the point where the angular momentum saturates at an integer value .    as expected from the analysis of the previous section , we find multiply quantized vortices for small values of @xmath12 , which split into arrays of singly quantized vortices for larger @xmath12 .",

    "the latter is the splitting frequency , operationally defined as the frequency where no mode of plotting the wave function reveals more than one density minimum . ]",
    "it is convenient to define a new quantity to describe the regime of stability of multiply quantized vortices .",

    "[ phdiag4 ] suggests that the critical coupling increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the physical reason for this is , that if the system is to accommodate many singly quantized vortices , the cores must be small and @xmath12 large .",

    "the multiply quantized vortices break up into arrays of several vortices .",
    "the physics of the transition is the interplay between the inter - vortex repulsion and the trapping potential . in the case of two - dimensional systems",
