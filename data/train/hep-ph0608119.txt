    "distinguishing @xmath0neutrinos from antineutrinos , can be easily done above the @xmath0production threshold energy , since then the charged  current ( cc ) channel is open .",
    "conservation of lepton number implies that neutrinos generate a tau lepton , while an antineutrino produces an antilepton .",
    "the charge of the tau lepton unambiguously reveals the nature of the incident neutrino beam . below the @xmath0threshold , @xmath0neutrinos or antineutrinos only interact with matter via neutral  current ( nc ) driven processes , and the outgoing lepton is also a neutrino or antineutrino , and the difference does not manifest itself in this clear way .",
    "nonetheless , it is out of any doubt the great interest of distinguishing between neutrinos and antineutrinos in different scenarious : cp  violation in @xmath1@xmath2 oscillations  @xcite , supernova  neutrino physics  @xcite neutrinos do not participate in cc reactions ] ,     very recently , jachowicz and collaborators suggested that in neutrino ",
    "nucleus processes , the helicity  related differences between neutrino and antineutrinos induce some asymmetries in the polarization of the ejected nucleons  @xcite . from this fact ,",
    "the authors of this reference conclude that these asymmetries represent a potential way to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos in nc neutrino scattering on nuclei .",
    "we present in this letter an alternative manner to distinguish @xmath0neutrinos from antineutrinos , below the @xmath0production threshold ( @xmath3 3.5 gev in the laboratory ( lab ) frame for production off the nucleon ) , but above the pion production one ( @xmath3 0.15 gev in the lab frame ) .",
    "the method is based on the different behavior of the nc pion production reaction in the nucleon , depending on whether it is induced by neutrinos or antineutrinos .",
    "this procedure for distinguishing @xmath0neutrinos from antineutrinos neither relies on any nuclear model , nor it is affected by any nuclear effect ( distortion of the outgoing nucleon waves , etc ... ) .",
    "we show that neutrino - antineutrino asymmetries occur both in the totally integrated cross sections and in the pion azimuthal differential distributions . to define the asymmetries for the latter distributions we just rely on lorentz - invariance , and experimentally it requires determining the neutrino scattering plane , detecting either a neutral or a positively charged pion and measuring its momentum .",
    "since the outgoing neutrino will not likely be detected , to fix the neutrino scattering plane would also require measuring the outgoing nucleon momentum and some knowledge of the incoming neutrino momentum .",
    "all these asymmetries are independent of the lepton family and can be experimentally measured by using electron or muon neutrinos , due to the lepton family universality of the nc neutrino interaction .",
    "nevertheless and to estimate their size , we have used the chiral model of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute them up to neutrino / antineutrino energies of 2 gev .",
    "we will focus on the neutrino  pion production reaction off the nucleon driven by neutral currents , @xmath4 though the generalization of the obtained expressions to antineutrino induced reactions is straightforward .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section , with respect to the outgoing neutrino and pion kinematical variables is given in the lab frame ( kinematics is sketched in fig  [ fig : coor ] ) by ) we have neglected the four - momentum carried out by the intermediate @xmath5boson with respect to its mass @xmath6 , and have used the existing relation between the gauge weak coupling constant , @xmath7 , and the fermi constant : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the electron charge , @xmath10 the weinberg angle , @xmath11 and @xmath12 the @xmath13boson mass . ]",
    "@xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the lab neutrino momenta , @xmath17 , the energy of the outgoing neutrino , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the momentum and energy of the pion in the lab system , @xmath20 mev@xmath21 , the fermi constant and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the leptonic and hadronic tensors , respectively .",
    "the leptonic tensor is given by ( in our convention , we take @xmath24 and the metric @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 and it is orthogonal to @xmath27 for massless neutrinos , i.e , @xmath28 .",
    "the hadronic tensor includes all sort of non - leptonic vertices and it reads @xmath29 with @xmath30 the nucleon mass and @xmath31 the energy of the outgoing nucleon . in the sum over initial and final nucleon spins ,",
    "the bar over the sum denotes the average over the initial ones . as for the one particle states they are normalized so that @xmath32 , and finally for the neutral current we take @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 quark fields , and @xmath10 the weinberg angle ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that with all these definitions , the matrix element @xmath38 is dimensionless .",
    "both , lepton and hadron tensors are independent of the neutrino lepton family , and therefore the cross section for the reaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : reac ] ) is the same for electron , muon or tau incident neutrinos . as the quantity @xmath39 is a lorentz scalar , to evaluate it we take for convenience @xmath40 in the @xmath41 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coor ] ) .",
    "referring now the pion variables to the outgoing @xmath42 pair center of mass frame ( as it is usual in pion electroproduction ) would be readily done by means of a boost in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "note that the azimuthal angle @xmath43 is left unchanged by such a boost .    for antineutrino induced reactions we have @xmath44 for the sake of simplicity , from now on , we will omit in the hadronic tensor the explicit reference to @xmath45 or @xmath46 and the nc @xmath47 label . by construction ,",
    "the hadronic tensor accomplishes @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) real symmetric ( antisymmetric ) tensors .",
    "the hadronic tensor is completely determined by up to a total of 19 lorentz scalar and real , structure functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 though @xmath53 is not orthogonal to @xmath54 , the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 terms do not contribute to the differential cross section since the leptonic tensor is orthogonal to the four vector @xmath54 for massless neutrinos .",
    "the tensor @xmath62 when contracted with the leptonic one , @xmath63 , provides a pseudo - scalar quantity , i.e. , such contraction is not invariant under a parity transformation . indeed , under a parity transformation we have , @xmath64 whereas the tensor @xmath65 transforms as @xmath66 .",
    "this explains the origin of the adopted labels pc and pv , which stand for parity violating and conserving contributions to the fifth differential cross section @xmath67 , respectively pseudo  tensor , whereas its antisymmetric part is just given by a levi - civita tensor .",
    "thus , to get a parity invariant quantity , the symmetric part of the hadronic tensor should not have any levi - civita tensor , while all terms of its antisymmetric part should contain a levi - civita tensor . ] .",
    "the triple differential cross section @xmath68 is a scalar , up to the factor @xmath69 .",
    "thus all parity - violating contributions must disappear when performing the pion solid angle integration .",
    "note that the coordinate system used to define @xmath70 involves the pseudo - vector @xmath71 to set up the @xmath72axis , which induces the non - parity invariant nature of @xmath67 . in electropion production processes , the leptonic tensor is purely symmetric , and the symmetric part of the hadronic one can not contain terms involving the levi - civita tensor , since the electromagnetic interaction preserves parity .",
    "hence in that case @xmath67 turns out to be a scalar under parity .",
    "a final remark concerns the time - reversal ( @xmath73 ) violation effects apparently encoded in the decomposition of the hadronic tensor in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w1][eq : w2 ] ) . under a time reversal transformation , and taking into account the antiunitary character of the @xmath74operator , we have @xmath75 and therefore @xmath76 is not @xmath74invariant either , because of the presence of the pv terms in the hadronic tensor ) , ( [ eq : parity ] ) and ( [ eq : time ] ) imply that the leptonic tensor , by itself , is invariant under cpt . ] .",
    "this does not necessarily means that there exists a violation of @xmath74invariance in the process  @xcite .",
    "time reversal is the transformation that changes the direction of time : @xmath77 .",
    "thus invariance under time reversal means that the description of physical processes does not show any asymmetry if we look backward in time .",
    "the invariance under time reversal is equivalent to @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the transition from the initial state @xmath80 to the final state @xmath81 , being @xmath82 its corresponding transition amplitude , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the states obtained from @xmath81 and @xmath80 , respectively , by reversing the momenta , spins , etc .. when one is dealing with electromagnetic or weak interactions , which may be treated to first order in the interaction hamiltonian ( @xmath85 ) , the transition matrix operator can be approximated by @xmath85 , being it then hermitian . in these circumstances @xmath86 and the invariance under time reversal may be written in the following form @xmath87 the above equation implies that the transition @xmath88 can not show up correlations that change sign under time reversal ( @xmath74odd correlations ) .",
    "thus at first order in the interaction hamiltonian , the tensor @xmath89 should vanish , since it would lead to violations of time reversal invariance .",
    "however , here we have strong interacting final states ( pion and nucleon ) and in fact the transition matrix operator is not hermitian , since it can not be approximated by @xmath85 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : time_approx ] ) does not hold and time reversal invariance does not forbid a non - vanishing @xmath89 tensor . in summary , besides genuine time reversal violations  @xcite violation  @xcite . ] , the existence of strong final state interaction effects resonance plays a central role  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the resonance width accounts partially for the strong final state interaction effects . ]",
    "allows for the existence of @xmath74odd correlations in @xmath90 , induced by the @xmath89 term of the hadronic tensor .",
    "after this discussion , we are in conditions of studying the pion azimuthal angle dependence of the differential cross section . with our election of kinematics ( @xmath91 in the xz plane ) , we find @xmath92 , and then @xmath93 where we explicitly show the @xmath43 dependence , depend on the lorentz scalar @xmath94 and @xmath95 factors , which are functions of the angle formed between the @xmath40 and @xmath18 vectors , and thus they are independent of @xmath43 , when @xmath40 is taken along the @xmath5axis . ] .",
    "the pv term of the hadronic tensor has led to the parity violating @xmath96 and @xmath97 contributions ( all of them proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "they disappear when the pion solid angle integration is performed , as anticipated .",
    "thanks to eq .",
    "( [ eq : anti ] ) , we obtain for neutrino and antineutrino reactions @xmath99",
    "from eqs .  ( [ eq : nuphi ] ) and  ( [ eq : nubarphi ] ) , we see that neutrino - antineutrino asymmetries may occur both in the totally integrated cross sections and in the pion azimuthal differential distributions . for the neutrino and antineutrino induced total cross sections we have @xmath100 while for the azimuthal distributions , relations of the type @xmath101 enhance neutrino - antineutrino asymmetries . to increase the statistics in these azimuthal asymmetries , it is interesting to study the relations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phisy ] ) and  ( [ eq : phiasy ] ) for integrated cross sections . from the discussion in the appendix  [ app : piad ] it follows @xmath102 where for each event , @xmath43 is the angle formed by the neutrino and pion scattering planes .",
    "since the outgoing neutrino will not likely be detected , if the incoming neutrino momentum is known , the neutrino scattering plane will be set up by detecting also the outgoing nucleon .",
    "indeed , the neutrino scattering plane is also determined by the incoming neutrino and the transferred momenta , and in the lab system this latter one is given by the sum of the outgoing nucleon and pion momenta ( @xmath103 ) . thus the strategy will be detecting in coincidences the outgoing pion and nucleon momenta ,",
    "use those to determine the neutrino scattering plane and then measure the corresponding @xmath43 angle .",
    "all these relations can be used to distinguish @xmath0neutrinos from antineutrinos , below the @xmath0production threshold , but above the pion production one . thus and using a proton target , the total cross section or the dependence on the angle formed by the neutrino and pion planes in either of the channels ,",
    "@xmath104 may be used to determine the nature of the incident @xmath0neutrino beam below the @xmath0production threshold .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that the @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 response functions , the integrated cross sections @xmath108 , @xmath109 and the partially integrated quantities @xmath110 and @xmath111 are independent of the lepton family and can be experimentally measured by using electron or muon neutrinos , due to the lepton family universality of the nc neutrino interaction . thus one would not have to rely on any theoretical model to determine the asymmetry relations proposed in this section .      the above suggestion for distinguishing neutrino from antineutrino in nc pion production reactions will be of no value if the terms @xmath112 and @xmath113 are much smaller than @xmath114 and @xmath115 . to estimate these response functions and address this issue , we have used the model developed in ref",
    ".  @xcite to study the weak pion production off the nucleon at intermediate energies . in this model , besides the delta pole mechanism @xmath116 ( weak excitation of the @xmath117 resonance and its subsequent decay into @xmath118 ) , some background terms , required by chiral symmetry , are also considered .",
    "these chiral background terms are calculated within a su(2 ) non - linear @xmath119 model involving pions and nucleons , which implements the pattern of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "the model gives a fair description of the neutrino and antineutrino cc and nc available data .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sectot ] , we show neutrino and antineutrino nc pion production total cross sections predicted by the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , as a function of the incoming neutrino or antineutrino energy . there",
    ", 68% cl bands ( external lines ) , inferred from uncertainties of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite are also displayed .",
    "those uncertainties come from re - adjusting the @xmath120 form  factor that controls the largest term of the @xmath121axial contribution .",
    "on the other hand , since the main dynamical ingredients of the model are the excitation of the  @xmath122 resonance and the non - resonant contributions deduced from the leading su(2 ) non - linear @xmath119 lagrangian involving pions and nucleons , we will concentrate in the pion - nucleon invariant mass @xmath123 gev region . for larger invariant masses , the chiral expansion will not work , or at least the lowest order used in ref .",
    "@xcite will not be sufficient and the effect of heavier resonances will become much more important  @xcite .",
    "for this reason in the figure , we always plot cross sections calculated with an invariant pion - nucleon mass cut of @xmath124 gev , it is to say we compute @xmath125 .",
    "such cut is commonly used in the cc pion production experimental analyses at intermediate energies .",
    "see for instance  @xcite where it can also be seen that up to incoming neutrino lab energies of the order of 1 gev the implementation of this cut hardly changes the measured cross section . in the figure",
    ", we also display low energy data measured in the argonne national laboratory ( anl )  @xcite for the @xmath126 reaction , which do not include any cut in @xmath23 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , including or not in the theoretical calculation the cut in @xmath23 only influences significantly the result for the highest energy data  point , leading to variations of the order of 20% , which are around half the experimental error .",
    "results of fig .",
    "[ fig : sectot ] are really significant since the differences between neutrino and antineutrino induced reactions are always large , about a factor of two , in all physical channels .",
    "this confirms that this observable can be used to distinguish neutrino from antineutrino above the pion production threshold .",
    "+    next we show results , within this model , for @xmath127 and @xmath128 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int - phisy ] ) and ( [ eq : int - phiasy ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] we plot these response functions for a @xmath129 final state .",
    "the rest of channels lead to similar results .",
    "clear neutrino - antineutrino asymmetries can be appreciated in both panels of the figure . in particular @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "have opposite signs .",
    "the difference between the number of events for which the pion comes out above the neutrino plane ( @xmath132 ) and those where the pion comes out below this plane ( @xmath133 ) is 4 @xmath134 [ 4 @xmath135 for a neutrino [ antineutrino ] induced process .",
    "thus , the sign of this difference would determine whether one has a neutrino or an antineutrino beam .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry based in the total cross section discussed above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sectot ] ) would provide a signal with much better statistical significance .",
    "this is because the ratio @xmath136 would be of the order of @xmath137 or smaller .",
    "asymmetries based on the @xmath138 response function will not be as much unfavorable , from the statistical point of view .",
    "these results point out that the neutrino  antineutrino asymmetries based on the total cross sections are certainly much more useful than those based on the the pion azimuthal response functions , for intermediate neutrino energies",
