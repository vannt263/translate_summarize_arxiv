    "the tevatron has been a hotbed of -physics activity since the start of run ii in 2001 .",
    "although  collisions at 1.96 tev present a much more challenging environment than that seen at the b - factories , the fact that all types of -hadrons are produced in cdf and  makes the tevatron -physics program complementary to those of babar , belle , and cleo .",
    "we will concentrate on two areas of this program : measurements of -lifetimes and the determination of the oscillation frequencies between neutral -mesons  -mixing . beside their intrinsic interest , these two topics are representative of the breadth of -physics and highlight some of the key experimental issues facing physicists attempting to study the -quark at hadron colliders .",
    "other topics in -physics at the tevatron are covered in @xcite .    the measurement of -hadron lifetimes and of the neutral -meson oscillation frequencies probe different aspects of the standard model and its possible extensions .",
    "lifetime measurements provide input to our understanding of how to use the theory of qcd .",
    "these measurements allow us to test extensions to the simple spectator model of weakly decaying -hadrons @xcite .",
    "in particular , ratios of -hadron lifetimes are sensitive to different aspects of beyond - spectator - model effects and have now been calculated to @xcite . @xmath0 \\nonumber \\\\    & & +    \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_{qcd}}{m_b } \\right)^4       \\left [ \\gamma_4^{(0 ) } + ... \\right ] \\label{eqn : life}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , the @xmath1 term is sensitive to meson / baryon differences and the @xmath2 terms reflect spectator - quark effects .",
    "higher order terms have been found to be negligible for ratios of , , and  mesons , but might be sizable for ratios involving -baryons . in the past ,",
    "experimental results , particularly for @xmath3 , have been in disagreement with these expectations .",
    "as we will see , recent tevatron results have gone a long way towards clarifying the situation .",
    "lifetime results are also important inputs to the other topic covered in these proceedings  -mixing measurements",
    ". oscillations of neutral -mesons (  and ) are very sensitive to the mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking because , within the standard model , the ckm matrix , which describes quark mixing , is a consequence of the higgs mechanism . since the standard model uses the simplest possible method of electro - weak symmetry breaking  a single higgs doublet  the ckm matrix is described , within this model , by only four parameters  three angles and a single -violating phase .",
    "other models of particle physics are , in general , much less constraining .",
    "thus , measurements of the correlations between ckm matrix elements provide powerful insight into physics beyond the standard model",
    ".    measurements of the frequency of  and  oscillations give us a handle on the ckm matrix element , .",
    "the key to this relationship lies in the different eigenstates of neutral -meson systems denoted _ weak _ , , and _",
    "mass_. the time evolution of the eigenstates of the weak interaction for -mesons containing @xmath4 quarks , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are governed by a schrdinger equation with off - diagonal elements : @xmath7 eigenstates of the system with definite mass , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are thus linear combinations of the weak eigenstates . oscillations between weak eigenstates then occur with a frequency proportional to the mass difference : @xmath10 further discussion of this , and of the -eigenstates can be found in @xcite .",
    "although , in principle , only is necessary to extract the ckm matrix element , , in practice the theoretical uncertainty on this extraction is reduced by more than a factor of three when the ratio /  is used @xcite : @xmath11 measurement of  has thus been a priority of the experimental high energy physics community since the first measurements of -mixing @xcite .",
    "the busy environment surrounding a -hadron produced in a collision at the tevatron leads to challenges for many aspects of the cdf and detectors , particularly in the areas of triggering and tracking .",
    "these challenges are apparent when considering the generic steps taken in a lifetime or mixing analysis .",
    "first , candidate events must be recorded from the 2.5 mhz beam collision rate .",
    "then -hadrons must be reconstructed within the recorded events .",
    "since both lifetime and mixing analyses involve understanding the proper time evolution of -decays , this quantity must be reconstructed by measuring the candidate -hadron",
    "s momentum and its decay length ( the distance between the production and decay points of the hadron ) .",
    "background levels must then be estimated . and finally , the relevant parameter ( @xmath12 or ) must be extracted from a fit to the data of predictions including all detector effects ( efficiencies , resolutions , etc ) and background corrections .",
    "triggers are critical in the first step of this process .",
    "both cdf and  employ three - level trigger systems to reduce the intrinsic interaction rate of @xmath132.5 mhz ( set by the bunch - crossing frequency ) to the 100 - 150 hz of events that can be written to permanent storage .",
    "the focus of the two experiments -physics triggers is quite different though .",
    "cdf relies heavily on triggers sensitive to tracks that are displaced from the primary vertex , while  uses mainly single- and di - muon triggers to collect its -physics sample .",
    "the difference in approach stems from the different accept - rates allowed at the first level of triggering  30 khz for cdf compared to 2 khz for .",
    "higher level-1 bandwidth allows the cdf collaboration to collect a large sample of events containing fully - hadronic -hadron decays .",
    "s large acceptance for muons , on the other hand , has allowed it to accumulate a large sample of semi - muonic -decays with little intrinsic lifetime bias .",
    "as we will see , these types of triggers dictate the type of analyses done by the two collaborations .",
    "once an event has been recorded , it is scrutinized for the presence of -hadrons . because of its muon - based triggers ,  tends to start this process by identifying candidate semi - muonic -decays while cdf uses a more inclusive approach . in the next steps",
    ", tracking is used to identify charged particles potentially coming from a -hadron decay chain .",
    "helpful in this process is the reconstruction of intermediate states in the chain , such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 . unlike at the b - factories , pion / kaon separation is not generally important here ( although cdf makes use of its d@xmath16/d@xmath17 and time - of - flight capabilities in some analyses ) .",
    "good invariant mass resolution is critical , however , as reconstructed mass is generally used to identify specific hadrons .",
    "cdf has the edge here ( by nearly a factor of four ) because of their large - volume tracking system . nevertheless , both experiments are able to accumulate large samples of -hadron decays with high purities .",
    "the final common feature in -hadron reconstruction for lifetime and mixing analyses is the estimation of the proper time of the -hadron s decay .",
    "this involves reconstructing the s production and decay points using vertices found from combinations of charged tracks . spatial resolution of the tracking systems is thus a crucial element of lifetime and mixing analyses .",
    "both cdf and  have similar ( and excellent ) capabilities here , with average uncertainties on proper time reconstructed using only the charged particles from a -decay of around 50 @xmath18 m for semi - leptonic -decays and 25 @xmath18 m for fully hadronic decays .",
    "these resolutions are well below typical -hadron lifetimes of @xmath13500 @xmath18 m and are also smaller than the  oscillation period of @xmath13100 @xmath18 m .",
    "reconstruction of the momenta of -hadrons is , of course , also an important element in estimating proper time . for the case of",
    "fully reconstructed , hadronic -decays the uncertainty that this introduces in the estimate of proper time is negligible compared to that associated with vertexing . for semi - leptonic decays , however , the true -hadron momentum can not be measured directly because of the presence of neutrinos in the decay . to deal with this , correction factors , derived from simulation ,",
    "are applied to the reconstructed ( from charged tracks ) proper time of each -candidate based on its assumed flavor and mode .",
    "cdf and  play an important role in our understanding of the lifetimes of weakly decaying -hadrons . not only are these experiments the only place where higher mass -mesons and all -baryons can be studied , they also provide competitive lifetime results for  and  mesons . in that area",
    ", cdf has produced recent preliminary measurements using fully reconstructed  and  decays to @xmath19 mesons and charged pions ; semi - leptonic decays involving @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons ; and decays to @xmath22 .",
    "has a published result on the /  lifetime ratio using @xmath23 final states . taken together , these tevatron results have a weight of @xmath1338% in the @xmath24 world average @xcite .    the tevatron has also been active in studies of the -meson , as we have seen in several contributions to this conference @xcite .",
    "the  lifetime plays a foundational role in these studies and both cdf and  have measured this quantity in a variety of ways .",
    "care must be taken when interpreting  lifetime results as these mesons have a non - negligible width difference between their mass eigenstates @xcite , which , for these purposes , are approximately equivalent to the eigenstates .",
    "lifetime results are thus only given for those decays in which the  content is well - known and are quoted as the average lifetime of the heavy and light mass eigenstates .",
    "cdf and  have several new results in this area , summarized in table  [ table : life ] .",
    "measurements of -baryon properties are also an important component of the tevatron -physics program @xcite .",
    "although several new baryon states have recently been observed by cdf and  @xcite , sufficient statistics to make a lifetime determination have only been accumulated for the -baryon .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath26 final states have been studied .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ table : life ] .",
    "they indicate generally good agreement with theoretical expectations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] ) . however , there is some discrepancy between the cdf and  results that will need to be understood with more data .",
    "the last lifetime measurement we will mention , that of the -meson , probes different theoretical issues than those states discussed previously . because the  is composed of two heavy quarks , it has more spectator - level decay possibilities than other weakly decaying -hadrons .",
    "in fact , theory predicts that the  lifetime should be approximately one third of that of the other -mesons .    on the experimental side , both cdf and",
    "have now collected large samples of  candidates in semi - leptonic decay modes , as well as smaller sets of fully hadronic decays .",
    "only semi - leptonic decays are currently used for the determination of the  lifetime , results of which are summarized in table  [ table : life ] .",
    ".recent -lifetime measurements from cdf and .",
    "integrated luminosity is given in . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : dms ]    the analyses producing the results mentioned above are similar to lifetime analyses in that they examine the proper time evolution of candidate  decays .",
    "an added feature is the use of _ tagging _ to determine the flavor ( or ) of the meson at production and decay . tagging the decay flavor is straightforward using charges of the decay products .",
    "production flavor tagging , however , is harder .",
    "two classes of techniques are used here : opposite side tagging ( ost ) and same side tagging ( sst ) .    because -quarks are produced in quark - antiquark pairs at the tevatron , the ost technique uses information about the `` other '' ( non- ) -hadron in the event to determine its production flavor . the  candidate is then assumed to have been produced with the opposite flavor .",
    "sst , on the other hand , uses information gleaned from fragmentation and other particles associated with the -meson itself to determine its flavor at production .",
    "the figure of merit associated with these techniques is called the _ tagging power _ , .",
    "it is composed of the efficiency , @xmath27 , for an event to be tagged as either oscillated or non - oscillated and the dilution , @xmath20 , a quantity related to the purity of the tagging method : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fraction of tags where the oscillated or non - oscillated state is correctly identified . tagging powers for the various modes used in cdf and  mixing analyses are give in table  [ table : dms ] .",
    "understanding tagging is obviously a critical component of mixing analyses into which the experiments have put a lot of effort .",
    "briefly speaking , ost is calibrated by measuring the well - known oscillation frequency .",
    "the  mass difference , , has been measured extremely accurately by babar and belle ( see @xcite for a compilation of these results ) .",
    "cdf and  @xcite can not compete with these measurements , but do use  analyses to simultaneously determine ost calibration parameters .",
    "the results obtained for  are fully consistent with the world average , giving us confidence in the ost technique .",
    "same side tagging performance , unlike that of the ost , is dependent upon the particular -meson flavor being considered . the method to verify its calibration",
    "therefore consists of ensuring that the sst gives similar results in data and mc control samples , such as @xmath30 .",
    "the mc is then assumed to give a correct description of the sst in -events .    with tagging well in hand ,",
    "fits are performed to determine the value of .",
    "scans of @xmath31 vs. assumed  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dms ] for all analysis modes in cdf @xcite and for the preliminary , combined  result .",
    "both experiments see minima in @xmath32 around 18 , measuring the following values for : @xmath33    scans of @xmath32 vs  for the two experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dms ] .",
    "the significance of the cdf result is 5.4@xmath34 ( background fluctuation probability of ) , while that of the measurement is 2.9@xmath34 ( with systematic effects included ) .        using the two measurements above and eq .",
    "[ eqn : vtdvts ] , we find an average value of @xmath35 of : @xmath36 where the `` exp '' error includes all statistical and systematic errors on the measurements of , while the `` theor '' error comes from the uncertainty on the ratio of decay constants and bag parameters from lattice calculations @xcite : @xmath37    it is interesting to note that the theoretical error on @xmath38 completely dominates the uncertainty of the ckm element ratio ( by a factor of nearly 7 ) and also that the relative error on the world average value of  ( 0.3% ) is now smaller than that on ( 0.5% ) @xcite .    these new measurements of",
    "have a large impact on tests of the consistency of the ckm picture of quark mixing .",
    "this is particularly evident when comparing experimental reconstruction of the `` unitarity triangle '' ( formed from one element of the ckm unitarity condition : + + = 0 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ut ] shows a comparison of the state of our knowledge of this triangle in 2003 and 2007 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the new measurement of  significantly increases the accuracy with which we know the apex of the unitarity triangle and favors those models of new physics that have a standard model , ckm - like flavor structure .",
    "we ve made remarkable progress in the field of -physics since the start of run ii at the tevatron . to cite just a few examples discussed here : our knowledge of -hadron lifetimes",
    "has improved by a factor of two or more depending on the hadron ; the accuracy to which we measure the  mixing frequency has increased by a factor of more than three , thanks to hard work at the b - factories ; and we have finally observed  oscillations , which are now measured with an uncertainty of only 0.3% .",
    "all these measurements , and many others , point to a picture of flavor that is consistent with the standard model ckm description .",
    "however , some cracks may be appearing in the mirror due to recent measurements of  violation in -mesons @xcite .    certainly then , the  is a system to watch  particularly in the -sector .",
    "advances on the oscillation frequency side will need to come from improved calculations though , since that is where the main source of uncertainty now lies . for lifetime measurements ,",
    "the increasingly large data sets being collected at the tevatron ( more than 4 have now been delivered to each experiment ) hold out the prospect of comprehensive tests of qcd models using a wide range of -hadrons . the experimental focus here will shift to baryons ( and the ) , including the newly observed @xmath39 and @xmath40 states .",
