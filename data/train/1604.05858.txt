    "one of the flagship properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is their variability .",
    "it was discovered ( @xcite ) right after or along with the discovery of this class of objects in 1963 ( @xcite ) .",
    "because agns are the most powerful sources of continuous light in the universe ( with the bolometric luminosities as high as @xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 or @xmath11 ) , their variability at timescales of months to years of order of 10% of the total light must be enormous .",
    "there are multiple lines of evidence that agns are powered by the accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ; ) .",
    "for example , chromatic microlensing of strongly gravitationally lensed agns provides us with the sizes ( @xmath12 au in optical ) and temperature profiles of accretion disks ( @xcite ) .    during the five decades since their discovery",
    ", we have witnessed an increasing number of studies on the variability of agns , on both data analyses and theory .",
    "the theoretical studies examined accretion disk instabilities , surface temperature fluctuations , and variable heating from coronal x - rays ( e.g. , ) but also currently considered as non - viable : microlensing and chain supernovae , also known as the starburst model ( @xcite ) . on the data side ,",
    "aperiodic luminosity fluctuations have been described by means of the rms variability ( sometimes the squared rms ) as a function of the time difference , or equivalently frequency , between epochs , and these methods are known as the structure function ( sf ) and power spectral density ( psd ) analyses , respectively . continuously growing , in length and cadence , quasar light curves from optical surveys",
    "enabled even more detailed studies and quantification of agn variability that include direct light curve modeling . a model that works particularly well",
    "is the damped random walk model ( drw ; @xcite ) , although various alternatives have been tested ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and some apparent deviations from it have been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "drw is also the simplest of a broader , more general class of continuous - time autoregressive moving average ( carma ) models , recently considered by @xcite and .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to _ explicitly _ review agn variability observables , in particular their connection to the core of the underlying process",
    ". we will be primarily interested in the sf analysis , but we also skim the psd analysis , both typically considered for sparse or short light curves .",
    "we briefly review the drw method ( or its siblings , e.g. , @xcite ) used to model light curves ( figure     [ fig : vardef ] ) .",
    "the importance of the first two of these observables lies in their model - independent capability to directly measure the covariance function of the signal ( i.e. , pinpoint the underlying process ) , while the drw light curve modeling lacks this capability ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second goal is to apply the sf method to @xmath09000 quasar light curves from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stripe 82 ( s82 ) in order to find the covariance function of the process and also basic variability parameters .",
    "subsequently we will be interested in correlations between the shape of the covariance function and the physical parameters of agns , such as the black hole mass , luminosity , eddington ratio , and redshift ( or equivalently the rest - frame wavelength ) . by means of monte carlo simulations",
    ", we will show how the sf or drw is affected by data quality or sampling ; in particular we present the biases in the derived sf and drw parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : var ] , we describe and discuss variability observables for agns . in section  [ sec : data ] , we analyze the sdss s82 data with the sf and drw models as well as simulate similar data sets in order to understand any problems , biases , or systematics . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss our findings .",
    "the paper is summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we will now explicitly review vital details of measuring agn variability .",
    "we briefly recollect that agn variability resembles and is well described by stochastic processes : it is aperiodic , meaning it has smooth psds ( with no peaks on periodograms ; e.g , @xcite ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will explicitly assume that agn variability is due to a single stochastic process or a combination of stochastic processes ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a data set composed of a collection of measured data @xmath13 ( e.g. , magnitudes ) at times @xmath14 with @xmath15 points ( hereafter a light curve ) that can be represented as a sum of the true signal @xmath16 and noise @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( see @xcite for an intuitive description of a time series analysis ) .",
    "having an agn light curve , we will be interested in the relationship of this light curve to its copy shifted by time @xmath19 for various @xmath20 days , because , as we will show , such a relationship contains the key to understanding the origin of variability . for each time shift @xmath19 ,",
    "often called the time `` lag , '' we will find all pairs of points occurring at the same instant with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the indices in the original and shifted light curves . because agns are typically distant sources , they participate in the hubble flow , and their redshifts @xmath24 are often substantial .",
    "we correct the observed - frame variability to the rest frame via @xmath25 . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume @xmath19 to be the rest - frame time lag .",
    "if an underlying stochastic process leading to variability is stationary ( its mean , variance , and probability do not change with time ) , then the relationship between the two light curves ( the original and the shifted one ) can be quantified by the covariance function    @xmath26    and the covariance for @xmath27 days ( @xmath28 ) is    @xmath29    where var@xmath30 is the data variance and @xmath31 is the mean .",
    "it is straightforward to show ( @xcite ) that the covariance of data ( from equation  ( [ eq : covgen ] ) ) can be expressed in terms of the data variance and the sf as    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    is the `` theoretical '' sf ( in units of squared magnitude ) , as opposed to the typically reported one that scales as @xmath34 ( in units of magnitude ) .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the form of the covariance function of the signal cov@xmath35 ( or equivalently in the autocorrelation function ( acf ) , which by definition is @xmath36 ) describing the underlying process leading to variability .",
    "it can be directly obtained from the data through the structure function ( from equation  ( [ eq : sftheory ] ) ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 because both the data and noise are assumed to be uncorrelated with the noise .",
    "we implicitly assumed above that both the signal and noise have gaussian distributions ( @xmath41 ) ; however , while we will be interested in gaussian processes for the signal , the noise may have a non - gaussian distribution ( @xmath42 ) . from equation  ( [ eq : sftheory ] )",
    "it follows that the rest - frame sf is @xmath43 and contains information on the covariance function of the process causing the variability .",
    "the true underlying sf , after subtracting the noise term @xmath44 or @xmath45 for a non - gaussian distribution , is    @xmath46    and hence    @xmath47    and @xcite defines @xmath48 because @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "the acf can take any value between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and its shape is simply a function of @xmath19 ( figure  [ fig : pe ] ) .",
    "it can be also thought of as a `` memory function , '' where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) reflects the perfect ( lack of ) memory , and any values in between 0 and 1 show how strongly two data points separated by @xmath19 `` remember '' each other .",
    "the calculation of @xmath55 is typically obtained from ( equation  ( [ eq : sftheoryv ] ) ) : @xmath56 \\label{eq : sfrms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or equivalently @xmath57 where iqr is the interquartile range between 25% and 75% of the sorted @xmath58 distribution , and the 0.741 coefficient is the conversion to @xmath59 for the normal or gaussian distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter description provides the rms values less affected by outliers in the distribution or if the distribution is non - gaussian . from equation  ( [ eq : sfrms ] )",
    "it is obvious that the sf measures the amount of the rms variability as a function of the time interval or `` lag '' ( @xmath19 ) between points .     for two @xmath19 regimes , @xmath60 days ( points with red or green fits ) and @xmath61 year ( points with blue fits ) , and for the agn mean magnitudes falling into three levels , @xmath62 mag , @xmath63 mag , and @xmath64 mag ( panels from top to bottom ) . for @xmath60 days , @xmath65 mag , so these distributions , in fact , show true uncertainty distributions ( they need to be divided by @xmath66 ) for a given magnitude .",
    "the photometric error bars are weakly non - gaussian ( red gaussian fits ) and are better described as a sum of a gaussian and an exponential function ( green fits ) .",
    "the distribution of differences at the longer lag is also weakly non - gaussian ( blue gaussian fits).,width=309 ]    note also that the rms around the mean is @xmath67=\\langle x\\rangle^2+\\sigma_x^2 $ ] , but in our case @xmath68 .",
    "we also calculate the rms of the differences ( and not around the mean ) , so @xmath69=2\\sigma_x^2 $ ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sftrue ] ) becomes then    @xmath70 - \\nonumber \\\\                      & - & { \\rm rms}^2\\left[y(t)-y(t+(\\delta t\\rightarrow 0))\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and a variant of it was used to study the sfs of _ spitzer _ mid - infrared agns in @xcite ( the second term was the rms for the nonvariable field objects without the requirement @xmath71 ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite seems to provide the most correct way to estimate sfs ( although sensitive to outliers ) from    @xmath72    where each magnitude measurement @xmath73 is accompanied by its own @xmath74 ( i.e. , dispersion of noise for this particular magnitude , typically estimated via dispersions from light curves of nonvariable field objects of the same magnitude ) and must be obtained prior to the sf calculation .      from equation  ( [ eq : sfobs ] )",
    "it follows that the shape of the observed sf as a function of @xmath19 strongly depends on @xmath75 for @xmath71 and is a function of a survey s photometric properties and a source magnitude .",
    "the noise term @xmath44 in equation  ( [ eq : sftrue ] ) could be directly calculated from the photometric error bars by assuming that @xmath76 , which typically is not true as the measurements uncertainties are often incorrectly estimated ( see a discussion by , e.g. , @xcite ) . there",
    "exist , operationally , better ways to do it : ( 1 ) it can be calculated as the rms of measurements ( or @xmath77 ) for nonvariable field objects with the same magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or ( 2 ) it can be directly estimated from @xmath78 for @xmath79 , because only then @xmath80 .",
    "please note that , by setting var@xmath81 , we implicitly assume the noise distribution to be gaussian , but from figure  [ fig : errorbars ] we see that the sdss s82 agns have a weakly non - gaussian distribution of uncertainties .",
    "if the distribution of uncertainties can be approximated by any function for which the variance exists , instead of subtracting the noise term @xmath44 , one should subtract @xmath82var@xmath83 .",
    "one may ask if the exponential wings of the distributions shown in figure  [ fig : errorbars ] are due to the photometric noise or rather are due to the underlying agn variability . as already explained , @xmath84var@xmath83 for @xmath79 , because only then @xmath80 . we have checked the corresponding distributions for the field sources ( stars , galaxies ) as in figure  [ fig : errorbars ] and they show similar exponential wings , so they are not due to agn variability .       with @xmath85 mag . in simulations we used the drw model . the input signal ( signal and noise ) sf is shown as the thick red ( black ) line .",
    "the calculated sfs from the two methods used in this study are given as red and black points .",
    "we also show what common sf measures return ( note that they should return the red line).,width=309 ]    one of the triggers for this study were both seemingly flat sfs ( @xmath860.4 ; as compared to that required by drw , @xmath87 ) and the discrepancies between them .",
    "it is obvious that sfs ( or psds , @xcite ) can not be single power laws ( spl ) for @xmath88 , because a very large or infinite power would be required at long timescales .",
    "therefore a typical sf is rather bent ( figure  [ fig : pe ] ) , and it has two ( or sometimes three ) regimes : for @xmath89 ( the red noise regime ) it can be fit as an spl of the form @xmath90 where sf@xmath91 is the variability amplitude at a fixed timescale @xmath92 .",
    "around @xmath93 we observe a transition , a turnover , from an spl into another spl with @xmath94 ( i.e. , the white noise ) , which is the second regime for @xmath95 .",
    "the third regime is for @xmath96 days ; in particular if the noise term is not subtracted ( or subtracted incompletely ) , then we are in an another spl regime with @xmath94 ( i.e. , white noise regime due to the photometric noise ) .",
    "this very short timescale regime vanishes provided the photometric noise is removed correctly . because the real data rarely show a gaussian - like behavior in the noise , sfs are uncertain in this regime , and it is best to simply exclude them from the analyses .",
    "in early studies , the turnover timescale @xmath97 was not known ( which is of about 500 days in the optical , @xcite , or about one year from the sfs in this study ) , and sfs were fit as an spl , which is obviously incorrect in the light of the infinite power required to generate variations at long lags , and henceforth the measured sfs must have been flat by definition ( @xcite ) .",
    "a number of authors use sf definitions that are obviously some measure of agn variability , but they are invalid in the light of measuring the underlying true sf and hence acf .",
    "the common problem is what kind of noise one should subtract when fitting an spl sf .",
    "the rule of thumb should be as follows : for a @xmath98 term one subtracts @xmath44 from it , and for a @xmath99 term one subtracts just a single @xmath100 .",
    "@xcite , apart from introducing a new method of variability analysis with the slepian wavelets variance , combines a number of sf calculation procedures found in the literature .",
    "we have tested these sf definitions on the simulated data ( see figure  [ fig : sfexplain2 ] ) :    @xmath101    from @xcite and @xcite is in fact twice the definition of the `` theoretical '' sf from equation  ( [ eq : sftheoryv ] ) .",
    "it does not subtract the noise term , and the square root of this equation ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) is equivalent to equation  ( [ eq : sfrmsmcl ] ) .",
    "fitting an spl sf to it gives flat sf slopes and can not be used to infer the acf .",
    "one would need to fit a full , four - parameter sf to obtain the correct result .",
    "@xmath102    from @xcite subtracts an incomplete noise term ( it should have a 2 in front of the noise term ) and leads to flatter sfs ( see figure  [ fig : sfexplain2 ] ) .",

    "in fact , the square root of it must be taken , and then it returns an sf shape to that from equation  ( [ eq : sfrmsmcl ] ) , but the whole sf is shifted toward lower values .",
    "@xmath105    from @xcite is a strange measure ; it generally looks as if it was subtracting too much of the noise term , leading to steeper and overall lower sf values . a plethora of sf definitions cause problems in their interpretations or comparisons ; for example , both @xcite and @xcite issue errata on sf definitions .",
    "@xcite provide an overview of an sf analysis and in particular point out problems ( unexpected breaks or wiggles ) and caveats in its interpretation .      in this paper , we will be using two methods to estimate and model sfs :    \\(1 ) in the first one , we will use equation  ( [ eq : sfrmsmcl ] ) , that is , without the photometric noise subtraction , to calculate the observed sf .",
    "we will fit to it the full , four - parameter sf described by the power exponential ( pe ) covariance matrix of the form @xmath106 .",
    "the four parameters include the power @xmath107 , decorrelation timescale @xmath97 , variance at long timescales @xmath108 , and the noise term @xmath75 :    @xmath109    we will also test a modification of the above fitting by fixing @xmath110 ( hence the three - parameter fit ) and study the remaining sf parameters .",
    "\\(2 ) we will also try another route where we calculate the distribution of @xmath111 for @xmath60 days and use it as the photometric noise estimate ( because @xmath112 as @xmath71 ) , and we then subtract it in quadrature from equation  ( [ eq : sfrmsmcl ] ) :    @xmath113    subsequently , we will fit an spl sf ( equation  ( [ eq : sfsinglefit ] ) ) for lags in the range @xmath114 days , before the sfs start to flatten .",

    "the dotted horizontal line marks the noise.,width=309 ]      in this paper , we will not measure the psd simply because sfs are much easier to calculate and do not suffer from operational problems like irregular sampling and data binning .",
    "we briefly review the topic because in many agn variability studies psds are the primary variability measure .",
    "we provide a means for their comparison to sfs and their connection to acfs .",
    "power spectral density psd@xmath115 , that is a function of frequency @xmath116 , by definition is @xmath117 and psd@xmath115 needs to be in units of power / hz if the total power is to be expressed in units of power .",
    "any time series @xmath73 , including agn variability , can be thought of as a combination of separate periodic signals with frequencies @xmath116 .",
    "using the fourier transform , we can decompose such a time series into a series in the frequency domain using ( e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath118    the parseval s theorem states that the total power in the time domain is equal to the total power in the frequency domain :    @xmath119    the combination of equations  ( [ eq : totpow1 ] ) and ( [ eq : totpow2 ] ) gives @xmath120 which is simply the square of the fourier transform of the signal and is expressed in units of mag@xmath121  hz@xmath10 .",
    "the spectra of aperiodic signals can be represented as power laws , psd@xmath122 , where for example @xmath123 is the white noise ( i.e. a constant psd across all @xmath116 values ) .",
    "the amount of power in any two dex are the same for the pink or flicker noise ( @xmath124 ) , and the random walk noise ( also brownian noise ) is described by @xmath125 . a typical agn psd is shown in figure  [ fig : vardef ] .    a relation of the psd to acf can be found via the fourier transform from the wiener ",
    "khinchin theorem that states @xmath126    because the psd measures the squared rms ( mag@xmath121  hz@xmath10 ) at a frequency @xmath116 , it can be thought of as `` a reflection '' of an sf ( measuring plain rms ) , where the time lag @xmath19 is replaced with a frequency @xmath116 and the conversion between powers is @xmath127 . please note that some authors present psd@xmath128hz instead of just psd and that the conversion between powers @xmath129 from @xcite is for psd@xmath128hz and the square of sf ( the `` theoretical '' sf ; equation  ( [ eq : sftheoryv ] ) ) .",
    "although it was noticed over half a century earlier ( @xcite ) , @xcite realized that the stochastic agn variability , in particular the `` red noise '' ( psd @xmath130 ) at short lags and the white noise at long ones , has the same properties as the stochastic process called the drw also known as a first - order continuous - time autoregressive process ( car(1 ) ) or ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ; @xcite ) process .",
    "subsequently , it has been shown that aperiodic optical light curves of individual quasars from ground - based studies can be well modeled by drw ( @xcite ) , while , at the `` very short timescales '' probed by the space - based _ kepler _ mission and apparently weakly probed by ground - based studies , the psd shows a departure from drw ( @xcite ; we will discuss this in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) . @xcite",
    "provide a more general approach to modeling unevenly sampled stochastic light curves using the carma models .",
    "drw is the simplest of the carma(@xmath131 ) models , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and as a matter of fact only drw can be identified with the physical processes such as brownian motions or the wiener process having a natural interpretation of the model parameters .    a quasar light curve can be described ( and fitted ) with the drw model , having just two model parameters : the damping timescale @xmath97 ( the same decorrelation timescale as in sfs ) and the modified variability amplitude @xmath134 ( or equivalently sf@xmath135 ; @xcite ) .",

    "we fitted the subensemble sfs with the full sf fit ( method ( 1 ) ) and found a lack of correlation of @xmath107 with the eddington ratio or the black hole mass ( table  [ tab : correl ] ) , but we found an anticorrelation of the asymptotic amplitude with the eddington ratio of the form @xmath175 , in agreement with the value found by @xcite , that is , @xmath176 , and in rough agreement with @xcite , who measured @xmath177 .",
    "please note , however , that they used the incomplete sf equation from @xcite .    because we are inspecting here a narrow luminosity range and @xmath178 ,",
    "the change in the eddington ratio ( @xmath179 ) is due to the changing black hole mass in a range @xmath180 .",
    "we observe a correlation of the amplitude with the black hole mass of the form @xmath181 , slightly higher than that ( 0.18 ) found in @xcite .",
    "the timescale @xmath97 is correlated with the black hole mass @xmath182 , with a somewhat higher index ( 0.21 ) than in @xcite , and is anticorrelated with the eddington ratio @xmath183 ( table  [ tab : correl ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) we selected 837 agns in a range @xmath184 ( constant black hole mass ) and @xmath173 ( similar redshift / emission wavelength ) and divided them into six luminosity classes with each containing 50200 agns .",

    "this is only partly true ; namely , _ kepler _",
    "psds appear to be steeper , but the frequencies involved , @xmath207@xmath208 hz or 1.2115 days , are in fact well probed by ground - based studies . in particular , the ogle survey with the cadence 24 days ( @xcite ) has been the gold standard for many astrophysical fields for over two decades , and @xcite was unable to find deviations from drw in such data .",
    "note , however , that @xcite recently showed that direct modeling of light curves with drw is equally good for both drw and non - drw processes and can not be used to identify what process is being modeled .",
    "there is rather a full discrepancy between _ kepler _ and the ground - based surveys , than the claimed one on `` very short time - scales '' ( _ kepler _    psds hit the white noise at ( or below ) the 1day cadence , so it does not probe the covariance of the signal below these timescales ) .",
    "so @xcite justly asked a question if _ kepler _ s light curves need reprocessing , and they positively answered to this question .",
    "in fact , steeper psds or sfs mean a faster variability that is `` easy to achieve '' by improper photometric procedures , such as when too much light / background is subtracted from a light curve .",
    "@xcite considered agn variability in light of a linear combination of multiple ou processes .",
    "such a combination of drw processes may lead to an average acf with powers different from @xmath110 , although individual processes are drw ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "so , for example , a shallower or steeper sf may mean either one process that is different from drw or a combination of drw processes leading to shallower or steeper sfs .    we will now discuss a drw modeling of the simulated sdss light curves with constant @xmath158 days and @xmath159 mag ,",
    "but for a range of redshifts and absolute magnitudes .",
    "for each redshift  absolute magnitude bin there are 1000 agn light curves generated and modeled with drw ( figure  [ fig : simuldrw ] ) .",
    "each model parameter is represented by a posterior probability distribution , where the peak is identified here with the best value and the width of the distribution ( the parameter uncertainty ) is not considered .",
    "of the 1000 best parameter values per bin we calculate their median . from figure",
    "[ fig : simuldrw ] , we see that the measured drw parameters are a strong function of the ratio of the input timescale ( which increases with redshift ) to the total experiment span .",
    "what happens if you cut an agn light curve , let us say , in half ?",
    "well , because the ratio of @xmath97 to the experiment length increases , the returned timescale decreases .",
    "so a longer light curve , with the same underlying process as the shorter one , will have a longer ( and closer to the true value ) timescale than the cut light curve .",
    "because this was not accounted for , it could have been the reason for problems in finding time lags due to light time travel in `` the photometric reverberation mapping '' of the ogle - iii ( eight years long ) and ogle - iv ( then four years long ) light curves in @xcite .      in figures  [ fig : realpe ] and [ fig : realspl ] , the sdss s82 data were divided into bins primarily to avoid mixing agns with the different photometric noise , which causes problems in subtracting or modeling it , but also to investigate any possible correlations of variability with the physical parameters of agns .",
    "we will now combine the results from these figures to obtain `` typical '' agn variability parameters .",
    "because bins contain different numbers of agns ( panel ( e ) in figure  [ fig : realspl ] ) , imagine a simple situation where we consider only two bins , one with 10 agns with an `` incorrect '' sf value and the second bin with 300 agns and the `` correct '' sf value .",
    "if they had equal weights , then the average of the two would be off from the `` correct value .",
    "'' therefore we will add weights in averaging bins : when constructing histograms , we simply count each bin a number of times equal to the number of agns in it .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histgamma ] , we present weighted histograms of the sf slope @xmath4",
    ". they were obtained from the two fitting methods , the full - fit sf slopes returning @xmath209 , and the spl sf fits .",
    "these histograms peak at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these values are a little higher than the expected @xmath87 from drw but are entirely consistent with it .",
    "the timescale @xmath97 has a wide and non - gaussian distribution .",
    "the median value is @xmath210 year , and we estimate the error bar using the iqr ; it is @xmath211 year .",
    "if we fitted this histogram with a gaussian , it yields @xmath5 year .",
    "the weighted histogram for the asymptotic amplitude is @xmath8 mag , while the one for the amplitude at one year is @xmath6 mag .",
    "note , however , that the sfs are already slightly flattening at this time lag , so the latter value is simply overestimated .",
    "the true value is @xmath212 mag .",
    "( pe @xmath107 and psd slope @xmath213 on top ) from fitting the full sf function ( black ) and an spl sf for @xmath114 days ( blue ) to the redshift ",
    "absolute magnitude bins ( corrected for biases ) . the histograms can be modeled relatively well as gaussians with the mean values @xmath214 and 0.52 , and dispersions @xmath215 and 0.06 , respectively .",
    "the drw model ( @xmath87 ) is marked with the vertical dotted line.,width=309 ]",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed basic variability observables that are often used in optical and infrared agn studies . from basic principles",
    "we show how to correctly measure the sf so it can be directly linked to the covariance function , or equivalently the autocorrelation function , of the underlying stochastic process ( or processes ) causing the variability ( please refer to @xcite for details on the stochastic processes ) .",
    "prior to the measurement of the agn variability parameters from the sdss s82 data , we simulate similar data sets where the input parameters are known . by comparison of the output and input parameters , we investigate biases and systematics that can potentially be present in the sf measurement from the real data . also by simulation means",
    "we review commonly used sf measures and point out their problems .",
    "the most common one is the subtraction of an incomplete or no noise term , leading to flat sf slopes .",
    "sfs can be successfully modeled as an spl for the rest - frame time lags in the range between days and about one year ( before turning into white noise ) , provided that the noise term is subtracted off carefully ( and fully ) .",
    "the key result of this paper is the slope of the sf measured from two methods : the full sf modeling using the pe covariance matrix and the spl sf fitting in the `` red noise regime . ''",
    "the two methods produce sf slope distributions peaking at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , which are slightly steeper than but consistent with a single drw model ( figure  [ fig : histgamma ] ) .",
    "the covariance function ( or the auto correlation function ) of the underlying stochastic process leading to variability is well described by the exponential @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is in the vicinity of unity . of the theoretically tested scenarios on the origin of variability with the available predictions on sfs ,",
    "the most viable is the model of accretion disk instabilities with @xmath218 ( @xcite ) . because sfs are model - independent and `` raw '' measures of variability , in fact we provide , for the first time , the direct proof that agn variability is akin to the drw process .",
    "the caveat is , however , that other covariance functions not considered here may potentially lead to similar sf slopes .",
    "@xcite simulated both drw and non - drw agn light curves , modeled them as the drw process , and found that it is so flexible that returns equally good fits for both drw and non - drw stochastic processes .",
    "hence , light curve modeling with drw can not be used as a proof for the variability being caused by the drw process .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we had already shown that drw can correctly model deterministic processes ( i.e. , nonstochastic ) such as pulsating variable stars , where the timescale is identified with the variability period . whether drw is the only underlying process that we observe is not clear . while the distribution of the sf slopes peaks at @xmath219 , as expected for drw , we also observe a weak steepening of the sf for bright agns ( with the lack of correlation with the black hole mass or eddington ratio ) .",
    "this effect is observed both in the sf modeling with freed slopes , but also when fixing @xmath87 as an increase of the decorrelation timescale with the increasing luminosity .",
    "the typical sf amplitude at one year is @xmath6 mag , but an spl fit overestimates this value because the true sf is already in the pink noise regime ( turning over ) .",
    "the true value of the sf amplitude at one year is @xmath212 mag , while the asymptotic variability is @xmath8 mag . the asymptotic variability @xmath108 is correlated with the black hole mass ( with an spl index of @xmath220 ) and strongly anticorrelated with the luminosity ( with an spl index of @xmath221 ) .",
    "the distribution of decorrelation timescales differs from a gaussian but can be approximated with @xmath5 year ( median @xmath210 year , @xmath211 year obtained from iqr ) , despite a weak prior on @xmath97 to be 1.5 year added in the minimization procedure .",
    "the timescale is correlated with the black hole mass ( with an spl index of @xmath222 ) and does not depend on luminosity ( an spl index of @xmath223 ) .",
    "agn variability can be further studied with longer , already existing or near - future data sets .",
    "there exists a data set of about 800 agns lying behind the magellanic clouds and discovered mostly by the magellanic quasars survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have been observed for nearly two decades by the ogle survey ( @xcite ) and should provide further clues on the decorrelation timescale , as the rest - frame timescales will be @xmath224 years .",
    "the advantage of these light curves is twofold : ( 1 ) they have a cadence of a few days and were obtained with a single telescope with nearly identical detector setup ( filters , pixel scale ) for different phases of the ogle survey , which will ease and make robust the data analysis ; ( 2 ) they are viewed through the magellanic clouds , so a large number of constant stars are available to correctly estimate the photometric noise .",
    "the _ gaia _ satellite ( ) , collecting data since mid-2014 , is planned to last five years , and it will scan the sky a median of 70 times .",
    "it will provide a usable photometry for broad @xmath225 mag for a billion objects , including hundreds of thousands of agns . while these data will weakly probe the sf at the decorrelation timescale ( they simply would have to be longer )",
    ", they will enable a study of the shape of the acf from ensembles based on a really large number of agns .",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) will be a 10-year - long , deep @xmath226 ab mag survey scanning three quarters of the sky in six optical / infrared filters from the southern hemisphere . although the typical cadence per filter will be only a month , it will provide an excellent data sets in six filters to study agn sf / acfs and their dependence on the physical parameters of agns .",
