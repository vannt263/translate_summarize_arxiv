    "the value of @xmath0 can be extracted from the experimental energies of isoscalar monopole vibrations ( giant monopole resonances gmr ) in nuclei . in a semi empirical macroscopic approach , the analysis is based upon a leptodermous expansion of the compression modulus of a nucleus , analogous to the liquid drop mass formula  @xcite . in principle",
    "such an expansion provides a `` model independent '' determination of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the macroscopic approach presents several ambiguities .",
    "the formula itself is based on the assumption that the breathing mode is a small amplitude vibration .",
    "more important , to correctly interpret the value of the volume term in the expansion , one has to assume a certain mode of vibration .",
    "it has been argued that a direct determination of the various contributions to the compression modulus through a fit of the breathing mode frequencies can not provide an accurate value for @xmath2 .",
    "recently it was shown by shlomo and youngblood  @xcite that the complete experimental data set on isoscalar monopole giant resonances does not limit the range of @xmath0 to better than @xmath3 mev .",
    "microscopic calculations of gmr excitation energies might provide a more reliable approach to the determination of the nuclear matter compression modulus .",
    "one starts by constructing sets of effective interactions which differ mostly by their prediction for @xmath0 , but otherwise reproduce reasonably well experimental data on nuclear properties .",

    "the time - dependence of collective dynamical quantities is actually not periodic , since generally giant resonances are not stationary states of the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "the coupling of the mean - field to the particle continuum allows for the decay of giant resonances by direct escape of particles . in the limit of small amplitude oscillations",

    "after the initial monopole deformation ( [ def ] ) , the proton and neutron densities have to be normalized .",
    "it should also be emphasized that apart from the fact that we concentrate on monopole excitations no assumption about the radial nature of the mode of vibrations is made in the time - dependent calculation .",

    "the complete experimental data set on isoscalar monopole giant resonances has been recently analyzed by shlomo and youngblood  @xcite . using a semi empirical macroscopic approach to deduce from the systematics of gmr the systematics of nuclear compressibility , and to extrapolate the data to infinite nuclear matter",

    "hs and l1 the fourier spectra are fragmented .",
    "the nl1 effective interaction reproduces especially well the ground - state properties of nuclei close to the stability line  @xcite , and it appears that the frequency of monopole oscillations for the nl1 parameter set is very close to the expected experimental excitation energy of @xmath76 mev .    in figs .",
    "2a and 2b the results for @xmath72zr are shown .",
    "the frequencies increase with @xmath0 , the motion is more anharmonic and more damped .",
    "the damping of the monopole moments comes from the coupling to the continuum , and there is also a contribution from the damping via the mean - field ( landau damping ) .",
    "the experimental gmr excitation energy for @xmath72zr of 16.5 mev is found between the values calculated for the nl1 and nl3 parameter sets . for nl1 ( 15.6 mev ) , nl3 ( 19.4 mev ) , nl - sh ( 21.1 mev ) and the lower frequency of nl2 ( 21.6 mev ) we display in fig .",
    "3 the corresponding transition densities . for nl1 , nl3 and nl - sh the transition densities show a radial dependence characteristic for the `` breathing '' mode : a change of the density in the volume at the expense of that on the surface .",
    "the details depend on the underlying shell structure .",
    "an unusual radial dependence is found for the nl2 parameterization .",
    "the transition density , both for protons and neutrons , has a minimum at @xmath83 , of the same sign as on the surface .",
    "the monopole oscillations at the center of the nucleus are in phase with surface oscillations .",
    "it seems that a similar behavior is found for hs and l1 , although due to fragmentation it is difficult to decide at which frequency to plot the transition density .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was stressed that , rather than on the systematics over the whole periodic table , the determination of the nuclear compressibility relies more on a good measurement and microscopic calculations of gmr in a single heavy nucleus such as @xmath73pb .",
    "the results of tdrmf calculations for @xmath73pb are presented in figs .",
    "4 - 7 . in figs .",
    "4a and 4b we display the monopole moments and their fourier power spectra . as one would expect for a heavy nucleus",
    ", there is very little fragmentation and a single mode dominates for all parameter sets .",
    "the experimental excitation energy @xmath74 mev is very close to the frequency of oscillations obtained with the nl3 parameter set : 14.1 mev . as in the case of @xmath72zr ,",
    "the calculated excitation energy for the nl1 parameter set ( @xmath84 mev ) , is approximately 1 mev lower than the average experimental value .",
    "the effective compression modulus @xmath66 ( [ modulus ] ) of @xmath73pb is displayed in fig .  5 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the observed behavior of @xmath66 is almost identical to the constrained compressibility calculated in the relativistic mean - field model using the generator coordinate method  @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the almost linear behavior , which is observed for the hs linear parameter set , is slightly more pronounced in the present time - dependent calculation .",
    "the transition densities that correspond to the main peaks calculated for the six effective interactions are displayed in figs .",
    "6a and 6b . in the left columns we plot the dynamical transition densities , calculated as",
    "fourier transforms of the time - dependent baryon densities . on the right hand sides",
    "the scaling densities are shown  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the ground - state vector density for protons ( neutrons ) . in the scaling model",
    "the transition densities follow from a simple radial scaling of the ground - state density , both the central density and the surface thickness vary .",
    "we notice that the scaling transition densities are almost identical , with a possible exception for l1 , for all effective interactions .",
    "they do not provide any information about the dynamics of isoscalar monopole vibrations . on the other hand , the radial shape of the transition",
    "densities that result from time - dependent calculations depends very much on the value of the nuclear matter compression modulus .",
    "as we have already seen for @xmath72zr , starting with nl2 ( @xmath87 mev ) , a minimum develops in the center of the nucleus .",
    "it also appears that the oscillations of proton and neutron densities are out of phase at @xmath83 .",
    "thus not only does the frequency of oscillations increase with @xmath0 , but also the radial dependence of the density oscillations changes dramatically .    in order to understand better this behavior",
    ", we separate in fig .",
    "7 the volume and surface contributions to the transition densities . following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite we define a velocity field associated with the collective motion @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the ground - state density , and @xmath90 denotes the transition densities shown in fig .",
    "the transition density is separated into two components @xmath91 @xmath92 the resulting volume and surface transition densities are shown in fig .",
    "7 for all six effective interactions .",
    "we notice that the surface contribution does not depend much on the parameter set used , that is , on the nuclear matter incompressibility .",
    "the volume transition density , as one would expect , is very sensitive to the value of @xmath2 .",
    "a very interesting phenomenon is the formation of standing waves in the bulk .",
    "it starts already for nl2 , but is clearly observed for hs and l1 .    the effective interactions nl1 and nl3 seem to produce gmr excitation energies which are quite close to the experimental values .",
    "we have therefore calculated , for these two parameter sets , the isoscalar giant monopole resonances in a number of doubly closed - shell nuclei : @xmath93ni , @xmath94sn , @xmath95zr , @xmath96gd . the results , together with those already discussed ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the energies of giant monopole states are determined from the fourier spectra of the time - dependent monopole moments , and are displayed as function of the mass number .",
    "we notice that the nl1 excitation energies are systematically lower , but that otherwise the two effective interactions produce very similar dependence on the mass number . the empirical curve @xmath97 mev is also included in the figure , and it follows very closely the excitation energies calculated with the nl3 parameter set .    experimental data on isovector giant monopole resonances are much less known .",
    "the systematics of excitation energies will not , in general , depend on the nuclear matter compression modulus .",
    "more likely , energies will depend on the coefficient of asymmetry energy .",
    "isovector excitations are therefore outside the main topic of the present study .",
    "nevertheless we have calculated the eigenfrequencies of isovector monopole modes , and compared them with available data on energies of giant monopole resonances .",
    "the time - dependent isovector monopole moments @xmath98 and the corresponding fourier spectra for @xmath73pb are displayed in fig .",
    "compared to the isoscalar vibrations ( fig .",
    "4 ) , we notice that the isovector oscillations are more damped and the anharmonicities are more pronounced .",
    "consequently , the fourier spectra are more fragmented . in each figure",
    "only the energy of the main peak is displayed .",
    "the four non - linear parameter sets produce similar fourier spectra , with most of the strength between 25 mev and 30 mev .",
    "the fragmentation of the fourier spectra is more pronounced for the linear effective interactions hs and l1 , with a considerable amount of strength shifted in the energy region @xmath99 mev .",
    "the results of time - dependent calculations should be compared with the experimental value for the iv gmr in @xmath73pb : @xmath100 mev  @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the time - dependent isovector monopole moments for @xmath71ca and @xmath72zr .",
    "although the oscillations are more anharmonic as compared to @xmath73pb , the corresponding fourier spectra are generally in agreement with the experimental data on the iv gmr : 31.1@xmath1012.2 mev for @xmath71ca and 28.5@xmath1012.6 mev for @xmath72zr  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , nuclear densities in the ground - state and first excited state are calculated , as well as the transition densities @xmath148 where @xmath49 and @xmath149 denote the resonance and the ground - state , respectively . using the four non - linear effective interactions nl1 , nl3 , nl - sh and nl2 , calculations have been performed for a number of spherical nuclei .    in table 2 the isoscalar monopole excitation energies are displayed .",
    "for the nl1 parameter set we also include in the second row the excitation energies obtained with constrained gcm calculations from ref .",
    "it appears that the inclusion of meson coherent states in the generating functions lowers the calculated excitation energies by approximately 0.5 mev .",
    "compared to the results of time - dependent calculations of sec .",
    "3 , the energies in table 2 are lower by more than 1 mev , and is some cases the difference is larger than 2 mev .",
    "the reason is that in constrained gcm calculations one implicitly assumes that the motion is adiabatic . in the time - dependent calculations on the other hand ,",
    "no assumption about the nature of the mode of vibration is made .",
    "the comparison between constrained and time - dependent mean - field calculations strongly emphasizes the fact that we have to understand how the nucleus vibrates in order to relate the excitation energies of monopole states to the nuclear matter compression modulus .    in fig .",
    "10 the calculated energies of giant monopole states are plotted as functions of @xmath150 .",
    "an average linear dependence is observed for all four parameter sets .",
    "the deviations from a pure linear dependence are relatively small for nl1 and nl3 .",
    "they are more pronounced for the effective interactions",
    "nl - sh and nl2 , for which the nuclear matter compression modulus @xmath151 mev . the effective nuclear compression moduli @xmath66 ( [ modulus ] ) of @xmath152o , @xmath71ca , @xmath72zr and @xmath73pb",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "11 as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the gcm results for @xmath68 and @xmath69 are used in ( [ modulus ] ) .",
    "we did not calculate @xmath66 from the curvature of the energy surface , and then @xmath68 from ( [ modulus ] ) , as was done in refs .",
    "the relation ( [ modulus ] ) is used to obtain an estimate for the values @xmath66 that result from gcm calculation , in which the dynamics of the system is described by the non diagonal matrix elements of the energy kernel . due to the correlations",
    "that these matrix elements produce , the calculated values of @xmath66 are somewhat lower than the corresponding results of ref .",
    "for @xmath73pb the values of @xmath66 can be compared with results of time - dependent calculations ( see fig .  5 ) . the constrained gcm transition densities ( [ trans - dens ] ) for @xmath73pb are shown in fig .  12 .",
    "similar in shape to those calculated in the scaling model ( fig .",
    "6 ) , the constrained transition densities display a radial behavior which does not significantly depend on the effective interaction .",
    "in contrast to the results of time - dependent calculation , the dynamics of isoscalar monopole vibrations which is described by the constrained transition densities does not depend on the effective compression modulus .",
    "again , this is due to the assumption of adiabatic motion , which is inherent in the constrained gcm approach .    in table 3",
    "we display the excitation energies of isovector monopole states in @xmath71ca , @xmath72zr and @xmath73pb , and compare the theoretical values with experimental data on isovector giant monopole resonances  @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been performed for the four non - linear parameter sets , and in the second column the corresponding asymmetry energy coefficients @xmath153 are included .",
    "we notice that the calculated excitation energies , like the results of time - dependent calculation , do not depend very much on the effective interaction .",
    "in particular , no simple relation can be established between the coefficient of asymmetry energy and the excitation energies of isovector states .",
    "the calculated values for @xmath71ca and @xmath72zr are close to the experimental excitation energies . for @xmath73pb",
    ", however , constrained gcm calculations produce results which are almost 10 mev lower that the experimental iv gmr .",
    "this is in contrast with the results of time - dependent calculation which center around 28 mev , in agreement with experimental data .",
    "this result might indicate that in a heavy nucleus such as @xmath73pb the assumption of adiabatic motion is not justified for the isovector mode . on the other hand",
    ", the constrained gcm results might also indicate that some strength should be expected around 17 mev for the isovector monopole mode in @xmath73pb .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent results ( fig .",
    "9 ) display some strength below the main peak in the fourier power spectra , but only very little below 20 mev . finally , the isovector transition densities for @xmath73pb are shown fig .  13 . as we have already seen for the isoscalar mode ,",
    "the transition densities depend very little on the effective interactions .",
    "relativistic mean field theory has been used to investigate the monopole eigenmodes of a number of spherical closed shell nuclei , from @xmath152o to the heavy nucleus @xmath73pb .",
    "two microscopic methods have been applied :    1 .   time - dependent relativistic mean - field calculations . starting from the self - consistent mean - field solution for the ground state and a set of appropriate initial conditions , the full set of time - dependent rmf equations is solved and dynamical variables are analyzed .",
    "collective isoscalar and isovector monopole oscillations are studied , which correspond to giant resonances in spherical nuclei .",
    "excitation energies and the structure of eigenmodes are determined from a fourier analysis of dynamical monopole moments and densities .",
    "2 .   the generator coordinate method , with generating functions that are solutions of constrained rmf calculations , is used to calculate excitation energies and transition densities of giant monopole states .",
    "constrained rmf calculations , with @xmath70 ( t=0 and t=1 ) as the constraint operator , determine the stationary wave - functions with different values of nuclear @xmath154 radii . using the generator",
    "coordinate method , the rmf - hamiltonian is diagonalized in the basis of these solutions .",
    "the lowest eigenmode corresponds to the correlated ground state .",
    "the solution for the first excited state describes the giant monopole resonance .",
    "calculations have been performed for six different parameter sets of the lagrangian .",
    "two of them correspond to older effective forces , which do not include nonlinear self - interaction of the @xmath12-field .",
    "the others are more modern parametrizations , which have been used with great success in recent years for a unified description of properties of nuclei over the periodic table ( binding energies , radii , isotopic shifts , deformation parameters , moments of inertia in superdeformed nuclei , nuclear halos at the neutron drip line ) .",
    "the six parameter sets differ essentially in the deduced value for the incompressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , from the energy spectra and transition densities calculated with these effective forces , it has been possible to study the connection between the incompressibility of nuclear matter and the breathing mode energy of spherical nuclei .    for the isoscalar mode we have found an almost linear relation between the excitation energy of the monopole resonance and the nuclear matter compression modulus .",
    "gcm calculations based on constrained solutions of the rmf equations yield , in general , slightly lower excitations energies as compared with results of time - dependent calculations .",
    "this can be understood from the assumption of adiabatic motion which is implicitly contained in constrained rmf calculations .",
    "no assumption about the nature of the mode is made in the time - dependent model . with both methods ,",
    "the effective interactions nl1 and nl3 produce gmr excitation energies which are close to the experimental data .",
    "based on the very precise experimental value for the isoscalar gmr energy in the heavy nucleus @xmath73pb , which is rather well reproduced by the set nl3 , we have derived a value of approximately 270 mev for the incompressibility of nuclear matter . for a series of doubly closed - shell nuclei , the effective interaction nl3",
    "reproduces the empirical result @xmath97 mev .",
    "transition densities provide valuable information on the structure of the different modes .",
    "it turns out that there are essential differences between the two methods .",
    "the constrained gcm transition densities are similar to those of the simple scaling model , and display a radial behavior which does not significantly depend on the effective force .",
    "this is not the case for the time - dependent rmf calculations . here",
    "the radial shape of the transition densities depends very much on the value of the nuclear matter compression modulus . only for the parameter sets nl1",
    ", nl3 , and nlsh , the transition densities display a radial shape characteristic for the breathing mode . for the other sets we find essential deviations in the nuclear interior , sometimes even standing waves .",
    "only the surface component of the transition density is rather independent on the effective force .",
    "as expected , for the isovector mode we have found no relation between the excitation energy of the giant resonance and the calculated incompressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "more damping and more fragmentation in the spectra is observed , compared to the isoscalar case .",
    "excitation energies that result from time - dependent calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "the constrained rmf results agree with experiment only for light and medium heavy nuclei . for @xmath73pb",
    "we find results which are almost 10 mev lower that the experimental t=1 gmr .",
    "this might indicate that in heavy nuclei the assumption of adiabatic motion is not justified for the isovector mode .",
    "summarizing our investigations in the framework of relativistic mean field theory , we conclude that the nuclear matter compression modulus @xmath155 mev is in reasonable agreement with the available data on spherical nuclei .",
