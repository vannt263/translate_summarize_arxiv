    "there has in recent years been a surge of interest within the physics community in the properties of networks , including the internet , the world wide web , and social and biological networks of various kinds  @xcite .",
    "work has been divided between studies of specific real - world networks , along with the development of measures and algorithms for their analysis , and the creation of models to predict and explain network behavior .",
    "it is on models that we focus here .",
    "network modeling goes back at least as far as the well - known random graph or bernoulli graph , studied by solomonoff and rapoport in the early 1950s  @xcite and famously by erds and rnyi  @xcite a decade later .",
    "the random graph however is a poor model for most real - world networks , as has been argued by many authors  @xcite , and so other models have been developed .",
    "recent attention has focused particularly on generalized random graphs such as the configuration model  @xcite and on generative models , particularly models of growing networks  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , another class of network models that , while widely used and valuable , has attracted little attention in the physics community , namely the class of `` exponential random graphs '' or `` @xmath0-star models . ''",
    "building on early statistical work by besag  @xcite , exponential random graphs were first studied in the 1980s by holland and leinhardt  @xcite , and later developed extensively by strauss and others  @xcite .",
    "today , they are commonly used as a practical tool by statisticians and social network analysts  @xcite .    despite their widespread adoption",
    ", few analytic results are known for exponential random graphs : most work has made use of computer simulation to fit models to observational data and evaluate model predictions .",
    "exponential random graphs however are ideally suited to study using the techniques of statistical physics .",
    "recently , physicists have examined exponential random graph models of network assortativity  @xcite and transitivity  @xcite . here",
    "we take a different approach and show how physics techniques can be used to derive analytically the behavior of one of the most fundamental of exponential random graph models , the 2-star model .",
    "we view this solution not only as a calculation of interest in its own right , but also as a demonstration of the way in which physics techniques can be fruitfully applied to problems from other fields .",
    "the exponential random graph is an ensemble model .",
    "one defines an ensemble consisting of the set of all simple undirected graphs with @xmath1 vertices and no self - edges ( i.e. ,  networks with either zero or one edge between each pair of distinct vertices ) and one specifies a probability @xmath2 for each graph  @xmath3 in this ensemble .",
    "properties of the model are calculated as averages over the ensemble .",
    "let us define the _ graph hamiltonian _",
    ", also referred to by statisticians as a _ log odds ratio _ , to be @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 ( usually called the free energy ) is any convenient origin for the measurement of the hamiltonian , such as , for instance , the log of the probability of the empty graph ( i.e. ,  the probability of @xmath1  vertices with no edges ) .",
    "then @xmath6 @xmath7 is the graph partition function and many quantities of interest can be calculated from it , or alternatively from the free energy .",
    "so far , this model is entirely general , but progress is made by assuming the hamiltonian to be a linear combination of scalar graph observables , such as number of edges , degree sequences , or clustering coefficients . in this paper",
    "we study one of the simplest nontrivial cases , the 2-star model , for which @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent parameters , @xmath11 is the number of edges in the graph and @xmath12 is the number of `` 2-stars . ''",
    "a 2-star is a pair of edges that share a common vertex .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the degree of vertex  @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and hence we can write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath17 where the `` coupling constant '' @xmath18 and the `` field '' @xmath19",
    ". the factor @xmath20 in the definition of @xmath21 is not strictly necessary , but it makes the equations simpler later on .",
    "there are two analytic approaches from statistical mechanics that can be brought to bear on problems like this .",
    "the first is to use perturbation theory  @xcite and the second is to use non - perturbative techniques , usually based on the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transform and saddle - point expansions  @xcite . here",
    "we make use of the latter to solve the 2-star model .",
    "our goal is to calculate the partition function  @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) , or equivalently the free energy .",
    "first , we introduce auxiliary fields  @xmath22 on the vertices of the graph using the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich relation @xmath23 which gives @xmath24^{n/2 }      \\int{\\mathcal{d}}{\\bm{\\phi}}\\>\\exp\\bigl(-(n-1)j\\sum_i\\phi_i^2\\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad\\times\\sum_g \\exp\\bigl(\\sum_i ( 2j\\phi_i+b)k_i\\bigr ) , \\label{partition1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 indicates the path integral over the fields  @xmath26 and",
    "we have interchanged the order of the integral and the sum over graphs  @xmath3 .",
    "the sum over graphs can now be performed by defining the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath27 equal to 1 if there is an edge between vertices @xmath14 and @xmath28 and zero otherwise .",
    "then , noting that @xmath29 , we can write @xmath30 \\sigma_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath27 is symmetric , its values for @xmath31 completely define the graph , and hence @xmath32\\sigma_{ij}}\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-6em } =        \\prod_{i < j } \\bigl(1 + { \\mathrm{e}}^{2j(\\phi_i+\\phi_j)+2b}\\bigr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ partition1 ] ) , we then get @xmath33 where the effective hamiltonian  @xmath34 is @xmath35    thus we have transformed our network model into a field theory of a continuous scalar field on @xmath1 sites , which can be solved using a variety of methods .",
    "the simplest mean - field approach is to ignore fluctuations and assume @xmath22 always to be equal to its most probable value , which occurs at the saddle point @xmath36 . \\label{mft1}\\ ] ] this has a symmetric solution @xmath37 for all  @xmath14 with @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{mft2}\\ ] ]    this quantity has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "the mean degree  @xmath39 of a vertex in the graph is given by the derivative of the free energy thus : @xmath40 where @xmath41 indicates an average in the @xmath42 ensemble of eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) . making the mean - field assumption of eq .",
    "( [ mft2 ] ) , this becomes @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 is simply proportional to the mean degree of a vertex , within the mean - field approximation . the quantity @xmath45 is called the `` connectance '' of the graph  it is the fraction of possible edges that are actually present and is a measure of the mean density .",
    "so we could also say that @xmath44 is equal to the connectance .",
    "this allows us to interpret eq .",
    "( [ mft2 ] ) very directly . for @xmath46 ,",
    "this equation has only a single solution , but for @xmath47 we have three coexisting solutions when @xmath48 is sufficiently close to  @xmath49 .",
    "only the outer two solutions are stable , giving us a bifurcation at @xmath50 corresponding to a continuous phase transition at this point to a symmetry broken state exhibiting two phases , one of high density ( typically nearly a complete graph ) and one of low density .",
    "we show a plot of the solution of  ( [ mft2 ] ) in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ meanfield ] .    along the line",
    "@xmath51 the hamiltonian  ( [ defsh ] ) is symmetric with respect to the interchange of edges and `` holes''the absence of edges between vertex pairs . in the inset to fig .",
    "[ meanfield ] we show the solution for the connectance as a function of @xmath21 along this symmetric line and the plot shows the bifurcation clearly .    to move beyond the mean - field result , we make use of the method of stationary phase . expanding the effective hamiltonian  ( [ effective ] ) about the mean - field solution to leading order we have @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the hessian matrix of second derivatives of @xmath34 with respect to  @xmath42 , evaluated at  @xmath55 . changing variables to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the matrix of eigenvectors of  @xmath54 , @xmath54  is diagonalized and @xmath58 , with @xmath59 being the @xmath14th eigenvalue of  @xmath54 . substituting into eq .",
    "( [ ft ] ) and observing that the jacobian of the variable change @xmath60 , the path integral becomes a product of independent gaussian integrals and @xmath61 , or equivalently @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the determinant of  @xmath54 .",
    "the elements of the hessian matrix have the values : @xmath64               & \\quad\\mbox{for $ i = j$ , }           \\end{array}\\ ] ] giving @xmath65 then , making use of eqs .",
    "( [ effective ] ) and  ( [ mft2 ] ) , we arrive at the solution for the free energy @xmath66 where we have kept leading order corrections to the mean - field result but dropped terms of order a constant and smaller that vanish in the large  @xmath1 limit .    from the free energy we can calculate expected values of a variety of properties of the model . for instance the mean degree  @xmath39 and",
    "the mean squared degree  @xmath67 are given by derivatives with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath21 and are equal to @xmath68 the leading order term in each case is the same as the mean - field result , so that in the limit of large  @xmath1 both @xmath39 and @xmath67 take their mean - field values .",
    "the variance of the degree @xmath69 on the other hand is zero within the mean - field approximation because of the cancellation of the leading terms but non - zero beyond mean - field : @xmath70 from consideration of fig .",
    "[ meanfield ] one might expect this quantity to diverge at the phase transition , but in fact it does not , having merely a cusp at that point . in fig .",
    "[ cusp ] we show the form of this function along the symmetric line @xmath51 as a function of  @xmath21 .",
    "the figure also shows the results of monte carlo simulations of the 2-star model for the same parameter values and , as we can see , agreement between the simulations and the analytic solution is excellent .",
    "a divergence does occur in the variance of the number of edges in the network at the phase transition .",
    "this quantity , which plays the role of a susceptibility for the model , is given to leading order by @xmath71 this diverges as @xmath72 as we approach the transition along the symmetric line @xmath51 .",
    "one can also ask whether the network described by the 2-star model possesses a giant component . molloy and reed  @xcite have demonstrated that a network without degree correlations possesses a giant component if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "we can evaluate this criterion using eqs .",
    "( [ spk ] ) and  ( [ spksq ] ) , and find that for all values of the system parameters the network possesses a giant component in the limit of large  @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] we show the phase diagram for the 2-star model as a function of the parameters @xmath21 and  @xmath48 .",
    "the critical point is at @xmath74 , @xmath75 and beyond this point there are high- and low - density phases separated by a phase coexistence region . in the coexistence region",
    "the phase of the model depends on its history in a manner characteristic of hysteretic systems .",
    "some studies of exponential random graphs have considered the case in which the number of edges in the graph is fixed , a `` conserved - order - parameter '' version of the current model  @xcite . in such a case",
    ", the phase coexistence region will correspond to true coexistence ; low free - energy states of the system will be states in which the system prefers simultaneously to have some high - degree `` hub '' vertices that connect to essentially all others and some of lower degree , rather than being uniform everywhere . such `` degenerate '' behavior has been observed since the earliest numerical experiments on exponential random graphs  @xcite .",
    "here we see that this behavior is the precise network analog of the phase separation phenomenon known to physicists from many other systems .",
    "in this paper , we have given a non - perturbative analytic solution of one of the oldest of network models , the 2-star model , which is perhaps the simplest nontrivial model of the class known as exponential random graphs and has been long studied in the social sciences . the model turns out to be perfectly suited to solution by the methods of statistical physics , and among other things the solution shows the degenerate behavior of the model in certain parameter regimes to be the result of a symmetry breaking between high- and low - density phases , which are separated from the `` normal '' region of the model by a continuous phase transition .",
    "the exponential random graphs are , we believe , an important class of network models , which have largely been neglected despite the high level of interest in networks in the last few years .",
    "we hope that others will also take up the study of these models , either using methods like those discussed here or other methods yet to be described .",
