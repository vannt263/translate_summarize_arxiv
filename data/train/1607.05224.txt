    "sufficiently large .",
    "we have presented the case of asymmetric erds - rnyi graphs , but the analysis of the symmetric case is almost identical . to be precise",
    "the case we treated is the one of a erds - rnyi multi - graph , because @xmath154 may have one s on the diagonal , so there are self loops .",
    "however it is straightforward to see that if @xmath155 in the case we just dealt with , the same is true if we erase the self loops .",

    "we now argue that , in spite of being appealing on a first look , our main results have strong limitations when we consider them from a _",
    "practical _ viewpoint , that is for @xmath4 large but on a _ reasonable _ scale ( e.g. , the ones of simulations or of the true systems to which would like to apply them , like for families of interacting cells ) .",
    "the problem is already present at a conceptual level : theorem  [ prop : prop_chaos_sparse ] does not require the graph to be connected .",
    "we develop in some detail a specific case with two connected components , but it will be clear to the reader that several generalizations are possible .    consider the easiest set up , that is non disordered kuramoto model ( i.e. , the dynamical version of the mean field plane rotator model ) : @xmath159 and @xmath160 for every @xmath161 and @xmath26 .",
    "we choose @xmath162 and @xmath163 if and only if both @xmath12 and @xmath164 are in @xmath165 or both are in @xmath166 .",

    "@xmath33 satisfies with @xmath167 ( more : @xmath168 for every @xmath4 ) .",

    "this equation is studied in detail in the literature - see in particular @xcite and references therein - but the important point for us is that all stationary solutions of that are probability densities can be written as @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is an arbitrary phase , @xmath173 an appropriate normalization constant and @xmath174 is any solution of a suitable one dimensional map ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fixed point problem admits @xmath175 as a solution , this corresponds to the uniform probability density @xmath176 , but for for @xmath177 it admits also a positive solution , which we just call @xmath178 and corresponds to a nontrivial probability density , corresponding to ( partial ) synchronization in the system . for @xmath179",
    "one can show @xcite suitable stability properties for the family of non trivial stationary solutions and it is straightforward to see that the uniform probability density is unstable .",
    "in fact if we rewrite in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath180 one verifies that at a linear level all modes decouple and they solve the equation @xmath181 , with @xmath182 for every mode @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( hence these are the two unstable modes , the zero mode is conserved ) .",
    "a more refined analysis , using the @xmath4 dimensional diffusion with initial condition given by iid random variables uniformly distributed on the circle , shows that a good approximation for the large @xmath4 evolution of the empirical mean @xmath185 is the linear sde @xmath186 with initial condition @xmath187 , independent of the ( standard ) brownian motion @xmath49 .",
    "the same is true for the sine mode ",
    "call @xmath188 the corresponding empirical mean  with new ( independent ) brownian motion and initial condition .",
    "these equations can be solved and the solution is a centered gaussian process . of particular interest is the _ synchronization _",

    "a full theory of the evolution of this @xmath4-dimensional diffusion problem has not been developed up to now and it is beyond the scope of this note , but , in analogy with @xcite , the fluctuations will lead to the escape from the flat state and a time @xmath191 , @xmath192 in the sense that for @xmath193 , any @xmath194 , the empirical measure of the system converges for @xmath195 to the uniform probability , but for @xmath196 , any @xmath197 , it converges to one of the _ synchronized _ solutions ( see fig .",

    "theorem  [ prop : prop_chaos_sparse ] and corollary  [ th : emp ] can not be substantially improved and , in general , there will be a breakdown on the time - scale @xmath209 of the information that it carries .",
    "this is particularly troublesome for the applications because times of the order @xmath209 are essentially finite times from a numerical viewpoint , but also for many , possibly most of , real life systems .",
    "2 .   our result ,",
    "as pointed out in the two item list at the end of section  [ sec : main ] , is twofold : let us reconsider these two items .",
    "for the first item , we have seen that we can have the breakdown of the reduction to f - p evolution , but this is not surprising because it already happens on the complete graph .",
    "however the second item is more troublesome .",
    "in fact , the example we presented shows that on logarithmic time scale the evolution on general graphs may have little to do with the complete graph counterpart , see fig .",
    "[ fig : escape ] and its caption : the flat profile escapes to a bimodal distribution in the two component case we have studied , while on the complete graph the distribution becomes unimodal .",
    "3 .   in spite of the breakdown of the proximity between the @xmath1-dimensional diffusion and the f - p limit , in various instances",
    "the analysis has been pushed well beyond finite or logarithmic times even in presence of phase transitions , that is many stationary states for the limit f - p pde : it is difficult to account for such a large literature , see e.g. @xcite for the case of multiple isolated and stable f - p stationary solutions in which stochastic deviations from f - p behavior happen on exponentially long times , see e.g. @xcite ( to limit ourselves to the kuramoto context that we consider ) for cases in which multiple stable stationary solutions are not isolated and stochastic effects happen on much shorter time scales ( power law in @xmath1 ) , and of course in presence of unstable states the deviations are observed on the @xmath209 scale .",
    "the example we have developed shows that going to longer time scales can not be done in our context without stronger hypotheses on the graph than just the degree condition .",
    "so the issue is : how should one complement the uniform degree condition in order to push the proximity of the graph case and the corresponding renormalized complete graph case to longer times ?",
    "it is worth underlying that one of the obstacles to apply the iterative method used for example in @xcite is the fact that on a graph that is not complete the empirical measure does not carry all the information about the system .",
    "4 .   of course the previous question could be asked also in cases in which one expects results that are uniform in time ( for example in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) , see @xcite also for more references on this issue ) . in these cases",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that our uniform degree condition could allow obtaining results that are uniform in time .",
    "this note raises questions more than it gives answers .",
    "nevertheless we mention in addition the remarkable open issue of sparse graphs , because we have only considered the case is which @xmath210 diverges as @xmath112 . from a technical viewpoint , our results in any case leave out some unbounded degree case that one would like to treat for completeness , notably the case of erds - rnyi graphs , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] , of vanishing edge density but with @xmath211 vanishing but like @xmath212 or slower : but where the issue becomes particularly intriguing is in the sparse case , i.e. @xmath213 , so the mean degree per site is the positive @xmath97 , in the case in which there is an infinite component ( so @xmath214 for erds - rnyi graphs ) .",
