    "determining the set of reachable operations given a set of enactable quadratic hamiltonians is an interesting endeavour , in view of the wide range of practical settings where such controls may be implemented  encompassing light fields , the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions , opto- and nano - mechanical oscillators and superconducting josephson junctions , to mention but a few  as well as the variety of tasks they allow for , such as entanglement generation , squeezing , cooling and quantum communication protocols @xcite .",
    "the group of all possible unitary operations generated by quadratic hamiltonians corresponds to the real symplectic group , and it is reasonable , in this context , to refer to a system as controllable if the reachable set coincides with the whole symplectic group .    on the theoretical side , this problem presents the peculiar feature that , although the symplectic group is a finite dimensional matrix group , the standard controllability condition provided by the lie algebra rank criterion , which is equivalent to controllability for finite dimensional unitary groups , is not sufficient @xcite .",
    "the reason for the difference is the non - compact nature of the symplectic group which provides the trajectories with the possibility of not recurring , this being impossible on compact groups .",
    "this characteristic presents itself in the operation known in quantum optics as squeezing , which can proceed indefinitely without ever recurring back to the identity operation . in a seminal paper jurdjevic and sussmann @xcite",
    "prove a sufficient condition for controllability on non - compact groups by considering the existence of control hamiltonians that recur .",
    "this aspect has been noted in the context of quantum optics @xcite , and an additional sufficient condition for controllability , based on the possibility of accessing a positive control hamiltonian , has been pointed out and discussed in regard to its connection with dynamical recurrence , elsewhere referred to as ` neutrality ' @xcite .",
    "furthermore it can be shown that , for systems comprised of a single degree of freedom , such a condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for controllability @xcite .",
    "one is then confronted with the intriguing situation that the lie - algebra rank criterion may hold and yet the reachable set may not be the whole symplectic group .",
    "this occurs where the set of controls does not contain any ` neutral ' element , which would go back to the identity operator after a certain recurrence time . in the quantum optical language",
    ", such a condition corresponds to the fact that all accessible hamiltonians have a squeezing component which is strong enough to prevent recurrence : since all such hamiltonians are unbounded from below , we shall refer to them as ` unstable ' @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the properties of the non - trivial reachable set of single - mode continuous variable systems under unstable quadratic controls .",
    "we will first review , and recast in the symplectic setting with reference to quantum optical operations , the analytical result of wu , li , zhang and tarn in @xcite concerning the uncontrollability of unstable single - mode systems .",
    "part of the formalism we will introduce in the process will be instrumental in establishing our main analytical finding : that unstable controls do not allow one to reach non - trivial symplectic orthogonal transformations ( corresponding to passive , energy - preserving phase - shifters in the lab ) , which implies a sharp restriction on the reachable set .",
    "further , we will demonstrate the application of optimal control techniques to the symplectic group , first explored in @xcite , and complete the characterisation of the reachable set through the resulting numerics .",

    "one refers to a hamiltonian @xmath2 as quadratic if it can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a real , symmetric @xmath5 matrix . as mentioned above , unitary transformations generated by quadratic hamiltonians correspond to transformations belonging to the symplectic group @xmath6 ( this can readily be seen by considering the heisenberg evolution of the vector of operators @xmath7 ) . in particular , one has that the hamiltonian evolution after a time @xmath8 is described by the symplectic transformation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 the algebra of the symplectic group @xmath11 is therefore characterised as the set of matrices that can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath4 is real and symmetric .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves here to the single - mode case ( @xmath13 ) and consider the open - loop control problem defined by the evolution equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , called the control function , is any locally bounded measurable function defined on the positive time domain @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the generator @xmath18 is often referred to as the drift term , in that it represents the ` always - on ' hamiltonian dynamics , while @xmath19 is the control term . given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the subset @xmath20 of @xmath21 with elements of the form @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    "is called the set of accessible dynamical generators of the system .",
    "it is sufficient to consider a single control term even though in general we could consider , at most , three linearly independent ones .",
    "if that were the case , however , the drift term would be subsumed in the controls , making the problem trivial .",
    "using two independent control generators , instead , would either subsume the drift term or imply that @xmath20 contains an , as yet undefined , elliptic element . in all such cases",
    "the lie algebra rank criterion would again become sufficient for controllability . here",

    "this fact can quickly be seen by noting that @xmath27 \\propto -{{\\rm det}\\,}[m ] \\propto -{{\\rm det}\\,}[h]$ ] .",
    "such a trajectory will always recur , in the sense that the operator @xmath29 $ ] will get arbitrarily close to the identity , in any matrix topology , at some positive time @xmath8 .",
    "note that the ` neutral ' elements mentioned before correspond to the elliptic elements for a single mode .",
    "furthermore , notice that elliptic elements may involve a certain ` amount ' of squeezing , in a sense that will be made clear .",
    "hyperbolic generators , instead , give rise to unstable dynamics , that will never recur .",
    "their hamiltonian matrix is neither negative nor positive and does not admit a decomposition into normal modes , as per williamson s theorem @xcite .",
    "parabolic generators are instead pathological in some sense , typically they can not be symplectically diagonalised , as they are jordan blocks of order @xmath30 ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "a common , well known example of such generators is the one associated with the free hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "these are also non - recurring but , to the purpose of our analysis , it is sufficient to only consider systems where @xmath20 solely contains hyperbolic elements , because single - mode systems involving parabolic controls either do not satisfy the lie algebra rank criterion or are controllable .",
    "let us also specify a basis of @xmath21 : @xmath32 which satisfies the algebra @xmath33 = -k_z , \\quad [ k_y , k_z ] = k_x , \\quad [ k_z , k_x ] = k_y.\\ ] ]    the generator @xmath34 is clearly elliptic : the group elements @xmath35 are all the @xmath30-dimensional rotations , forming the abelian group @xmath36 , which is the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath37 . in the lab , these correspond to phase - plates , or phase - shifters , that rotate the optical phase of a field : these are all the passive ( or energy - preserving in that they preserve the number of excitations ) operations belonging to @xmath37 .",
    "the hyperbolic generators @xmath38 and @xmath39 instead generate single - mode squeezing operations . if a linear combination of generators is considered , such as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , it is easy to show that it is elliptic for @xmath42 , parabolic for @xmath43 and hyperbolic for @xmath44 .",
