    "the study of the regularity ( i.e. boundedness ) of local fios in @xmath4 spaces for @xmath22 goes back , in the case of @xmath23 , to the pioneering work of hrmander where the @xmath24 boundedness was proven when the amplitude verifies with @xmath25 .",

    "our goal is to prove that @xmath34 defines a bounded bilinear operator on a product of @xmath4 or @xmath35 spaces were the target space could either be a banach or a non - banach @xmath4 space , whenever the phases verify the same conditions as in the seeger - sogge - stein theorem .",
    "therefore , our theorem is a bilinear version of this result .",
    "this can also be seen as an extension of the results of r. coifman and y. meyer @xcite , and l. grafakos and r.torres for bilinear pseudodifferential operators , which can be regarded as particular examples of operators of the type with linear phases @xmath36 .",
    "+ we shall briefly review what is known about the boundedness of bilinear fios of the type .",
    "the first result in this direction was proven by l. grafakos and m. peloso in @xcite where the authors showed the boundedness of @xmath37 from @xmath1 under the assumptions that @xmath38 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 . in @xcite , s. rodrguez - lpez and",
    "w. staubach extended this theorem to the full range of exponents @xmath40 .",
    "the main result of this paper , namely theorem [ main ] , extends this boundedness to the endpoint @xmath41 .",
    "+ it turns out that proving our main theorem is a technical task and requires some heavy machinery from various parts of harmonic analysis . to clarify why the situation becomes complicated , one could consider operators with phases @xmath42 with @xmath43 , positively homogeneous of degree 1 in @xmath11 .",
    "we will illustrate here that operators with such phases and amplitudes satisfying can not easily be understood with previously available techniques without slightly artificial additional assumptions which will require more decay from the symbol and rather un - natural restrictions on the phase functions . following the freezing of the variables argument of coifman - meyer",
    "( see @xcite page 157 ) , one introduces the function @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a smooth cut - off function . using sobolev s embedding theorem we have that @xmath46 and the desired @xmath1 ( say for @xmath47 ) boundedness of the fourier integral operator with phases",
    "@xmath48 would follow by estimating the @xmath49 norm of @xmath50 with an upper bound in terms of the @xmath4 and @xmath51 norms of @xmath15 and @xmath52 repectively .",
    "given the smoothness and the compact support in @xmath53 , this in turn amounts to obtaining the aforementioned upper bound for @xmath54 .",
    "now using leibniz s rule and the chain rule , matters reduce to the study of @xmath55 boundedness of operators of the form @xmath56^k\\ , \\sigma(x,\\xi,\\eta)\\ , e^{i\\lambda_1(y,\\xi)+i\\lambda_2(y,\\eta)}\\times \\\\ \\hat{f}(\\xi)\\ , \\hat{g}(\\eta)e^{ix\\cdot(\\xi + \\eta)}\\ , { \\,\\text{\\rm{\\mbox{\\dj}}}}\\xi { \\,\\text{\\rm{\\mbox{\\dj}}}}\\eta , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "if for @xmath60 one has the estimates @xmath61 then in light of a recent result of a. miyachi and n. tomita @xcite , the @xmath1 boundedness with @xmath3 is indeed valid .",
    "but if we for instance and for the sake of comparison consider the case of the @xmath62 boundedness for operators that satisfy with @xmath25 , then the conditions above on the phase @xmath63 are not in general enough to yield the desired boundedness . however , in this paper we are able to apply our @xmath62 result to operators with amplitudes satisfying with @xmath25 and phases that are for example of the form @xmath64 where the notation @xmath65 stands for @xmath66 .",
    "observe that that if we set @xmath67 then it is clear that estimate @xmath68 is not valid and so even if the amplitude of the operator did satisfy with @xmath69 , the discussion above does nt apply to the corresponding bilinear operator in order to prove the @xmath62 boundedness .",
    "an attempt to eliminate the growth in @xmath6 by replacing @xmath70 in the example above would not always reduce the operator to one which could be treated by the bilinear pseudodifferential theory .",
    "for example , consider an operator in dimension one given by @xmath71 once again , viewing this operator as a bilinear pseudodifferential operator , we observe that it has the symbol @xmath72 which at best belongs to the class @xmath73 ( again see definition [ defn of hormander symbols ] below ) .",
    "this is not a favourable class of symbols to study , even for linear operators .",
    "moreover setting @xmath74 we still will not have the boundedness of @xmath75 and therefore not even the boundedness result sketched above could be applied to this case .",
    "but once again , our result applies in this case and yields the @xmath62 regularity .",
    "+ to show the @xmath1 boundedness of bilinear fios we shall prove the boundedness on @xmath62 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and finally @xmath83 . in the investigation of each case ,",
    "there are certain technical difficulties that need to be overcome , and in tackling these we have taken a more abstract attitude to proving propositions and lemmas that could be useful even outside the context of the specific case .",
    "bilinear interpolation yields then the desired result for the full range of exponents @xmath84 and @xmath85 . + in proving these boundedness results , we start by decomposing the operator into low and high frequency parts . in section [ sec : low_frequency ] , we analyse the problem when the operators are localized in one of the frequency variables ( see theorem [ main_low ] ) .",
    "then in section [ sect : high ] , in order to study the high frequency part of the operator when the target space is banach , we will introduce a continuous version of the symbol decomposition for bilinear paraproducts due to a. caldern and coifman - meyer , which we have adapted to the study of bilinear fios .",
    "thereafter , using commutators and our parameter dependant composition formula for pseudodifferential and fourier integral operators ( theorem [ left composition with pseudo ] below ) , we reduce the study of bilinear fios to the analysis of main terms and error terms .",
    "the error terms of the commutators can be mainly handled by applying known results concerning boundedness of linear fios .",
    "the analyses of the main terms , however , need to be carried out as separate case studies , where in some cases it behoves us to assume that the dimension of the space is at least two .    in the case of @xmath62 ,",
    "the main term can be reduced to a composition of a bilinear paraproduct and two linear fios . for",
    "the @xmath76 , @xmath77 cases we use kernel estimates , quadratic estimates and carleson measure estimates . for @xmath78",
    ", we use once again carleson measure estimates , the fefferman - stein theory of real hardy spaces and the stein - weiss theory of harmonic functions on @xmath86 . in the cases of @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    ", we use goldberg s theory of local hardy and bmo spaces .",
    "these are all carrried out in subsection [ sec : banach_boundedness_result ] .",
    "+ it is rather surprising that some of the endpoint results above actually fail in dimension one ( in which case the order of the amplitude is @xmath25 ) . indeed in section [ sect:1d ]",
    ", we provide counterexamples to the @xmath78 , @xmath80 and @xmath87 ( @xmath22 ) boundedness of one dimensional bilinear fios .",
    "this means that , for the order @xmath88 , the one dimensional results in @xcite concerning the boundedness in @xmath89 and @xmath90 are sharp .",
    "+ for the cases @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we are outside the realm of banach spaces , and therefore we will need to use a discrete decomposition of the operator .",
    "thereafter we use peetre s maximal function , the fefferman - stein vector - valued maximal function estimates and the theory of triebel - lizorkin spaces . it is worth mentioning that the method we use to prove the first two boundedness results does not rely on any atomic decomposition of @xmath91 which is the standard approach in establishing regularity in hardy spaces .",
    "these non - banach results are established in a more general setting in section [ sect : non_banach ] .",
    "+ finally , section [ sec : proof_of_asymptotic ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ left composition with pseudo ] , concerning composition of parameter dependant pseudodifferential and fourier integral operators .",
