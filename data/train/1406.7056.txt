    "we have tested different particle numbers with different proportion of @xmath87 . for small number of atoms ,",
    "the nonlinear repulsion between the two - species atoms are too weak to prevent the knot shrinking .",
    "so it is important to adjust the particle numbers and the interaction coefficients to keep the topological structure .",

    "proposals for experimental realizations of the knots can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented the exact 3d solution which exhibits a knot for the linear gpes .",
