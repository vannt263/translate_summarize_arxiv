    "( b ) a sem photograph of sample b ( w = 800 nm).,width=566 ]    currently , iron based superconductors are object of intense investigations concerning their fundamental properties@xcite .",
    "a potential use of these materials is in the field of large scale current transport @xcite . however , as is well known , the presence of mobile magnetic flux lines in superconductor samples affects their current transport properties even when a magnetic field is not expressly applied @xcite . in this case the magnetic field self - generated by the bias current is able by itself to create magnetic vortices that , when in motion , induce dissipation in the sample under test .",
    "according to the creep flow model @xcite the degree of dissipation in a superconducting film , for a fixed current density , depends on the pinning potential @xmath3 of the film and on the density of pinning sites . for electronics and nano - electronics applications of new superconducting materials , like the recently discovered iron based pnictides and chalcogenides superconductors ,",
    "the study of the pinning energy and the current transport under condition of weak magnetic field is of fundamental interest since the magnetic field experienced by the films ( which are patterned in the form of submicron strip - lines ) is as low as few tens of gauss in those applications . from this point of view",
    ", these investigations are analogous for primary relevance to those carried out under conditions of high magnetic fields , when the research perspective is the employment of these materials for high power applications @xcite . with these motivations in mind , in this work we have investigated the current induced resistive state of narrow ( width @xmath5 m ) fe(se , te ) iron - chalcogenide nanostrips .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics have been measured at different temperatures @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the superconductor critical temperature ) , at sub - critical current values ( @xmath8 ) and in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "we show that the experimental results can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a flux depinning model of quasi - isolated vortices . a pinning energy of order of few tens of mev , as well as a pinning range of few nanometers ,",
    "are estimated , compatible with defects extending along the film thickness .",
    "although the analysis carried out with conventional flux creep models in zero external field @xcite qualitatively account for the observed features , an important corrective term , proportional to @xmath9 , must be introduced for improving the accuracy of the pinning energy estimate .",
    "this correction stems from the very narrow width of the sample under test .",
    "the element to consider necessarily is the attractive lorentz - like force exerted between magnetic vortex lines of opposite sign entering the two close opposite edges ( vortex - antivortex interaction ) .",
    "this force usually is negligible in large width samples ( @xmath10 or larger ) because the self - generated magnetic flux lines are sufficiently separated most of their life time while crossing the strip . on the contrary , in narrow strips ( @xmath11 ) at sub - critical bias currents",
    ", this force may be as intense as the lorentz force .",
    "nevertheless , even with the introduction of this correction , the resulting pinning energy is lower than the one reported in literature for fe(se , te ) in the presence of intense magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "( the current at which the voltage @xmath12 @xmath13v appears across the nanostrips ) for ( a ) , sample a and ( b ) , sample b[fig : linear ] ]     relation ) as obtained from data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvc ] .",
    "almost linear dependence of log(v ) on 1/t is observed consistently with the theoretical flux creep model , equation ( [ eq : enpuku ] ) ( solid lines).,width=566 ]    .[tab : table1 ] parameters of the nanostrips .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , ( @xmath7 = 12 k ) ]      in nanostrips with w@xmath14 , the simultaneous presence of magnetic flux lines of opposite sign enucleated at opposite edges within a distance @xmath15 must be taken into account .",
    "indeed there is an extra force , acting all the time and independently from the bias current , which contributes to push inward couples of magnetic flux lines with opposite sign attracting each other .",
    "this contribution adds to the work @xmath16 done by the average lorentz force and can be roughly estimated as follows .",
    "the attractive force per unit length between two vortices of opposite sign separated by @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the modified bessel function of second kind of order one .",
    "now we assume that the two magnetic flux lines from opposite edges hop in steps of length @xmath4 towards the centre of the bridge where they self - annihilate .",
    "the interval of separation of the two flux lines ranges between a maximum @xmath20 and a minimum distance before annihilation which is approximately equal to @xmath21 .",
    "the work done by the mean attractive force per unit length @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) during the motion of one vortex from one pinning site to another is @xmath24 , that is @xmath25 where we have used equation ( [ eq : jc1 ] ) and the approximation @xmath26 , valid for @xmath27 .",
    "note that in a large width bridge ( @xmath28 ) this energy contribution is small and can be neglected .",
    "we now evaluate the effect on @xmath29 of the correction due to @xmath30 .",
    "the barrier against creep with the introduction of @xmath31 becomes @xmath32 the critical condition of barrier suppression against creep , @xmath33 when @xmath34 , gives @xmath35 equation ( [ eq : enpuku ] ) generalizes to @xmath36 where we have used equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) at @xmath37 . for @xmath38 , we assume @xmath39 and we have @xmath40 the comparison with the experimental data provides now for @xmath29 @xmath41 where again @xmath42 . as summarized in table ii the obtained values of @xmath29 are now greater , @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 mev for sample a and sample b , respectively .",
    "nevertheless the ultimate origin of the persisting difference in values found for the pinning energy in the two samples remains unclear . through equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) it is possible to estimate also the pinning potential range @xmath4 .",
    "one obtains , quite reasonably , @xmath45 nm and @xmath46 nm for sample a and b , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to compare the found @xmath29 values with the theoretical estimates which relate the pinning energy with the kind of defect .",
    "these estimates are based on the general observation that the condensation energy @xmath47 of a volume @xmath48 of the vortex core can be saved if the flux line core passes through a region where the order parameter is already zero .",
    "here @xmath49 is the thermodynamical critical field given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the upper critical field . for point like defects consisting of a small spherical void ( @xmath53 ) , or non superconductive inclusion , of diameter @xmath54 , smaller than the coherence length @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath3 is given by @xcite @xmath55 even with @xmath56 , one obtains a pinning energy as small as @xmath57 mev with @xmath58 t , @xmath59 nm@xmath60 nm ( corresponding to a thermodynamic field @xmath61 of 0.25 t ) . that suggests a high number ( order of hundreds ) of small point - like type defects which pin the magnetic flux line through the thickness @xmath62 of the nanostrips .",
    "for a void larger than the core region the maximum pinning energy depends on the shape and orientation of the void .",
    "for the case of a sharp void surface ( @xmath63 ) of length @xmath64 ( i.e. occupying all the thickness ) parallel to the vortex , the pinning energy is given by @xcite @xmath65 which results in @xmath66 mev for a void occupying the whole thickness of the film @xmath67 and with @xmath58 t. this suggest 2 d defects extending over a large fraction of the thickness .",
    "assuming the temperature dependencies of @xmath49 and @xmath21 given by the ginzburg - landau theory , we obtain from equation ( [ eq : smallvoid ] ) the temperature dependence of u as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a parameter close to one . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut ] the solid line shows the theoretical result with @xmath70 ; the critical temperature has been chosen as @xmath71 k ( instead of @xmath72 k ) so as to fit the theoretical values to the experimental values . as can be seen",
    ", the experimental temperature dependence of @xmath3 is in this way satisfactorily reproduced .",
    "work is in progress now to study the detailed nature of @xmath3 .",
    "besides conventional mechanisms due to defects of the material , pinning originated by the interaction of fluxons with the local magnetization could be also considered in fe(se , te ) . to this end ,",
    "the occurrence of a periodic pinning potential related to the formation of the collinear aligned spin anti - ferromagnetic order at low temperatures @xcite is a stimulating theoretical possibility .",
    "also in this case , thermally activation mechanism of the self - generated flux lines and uncorrelated motion of the flux lines can explain our experimental data .",
    "fe(se , te ) highly oriented thin films base electrodes were prepared by laser ablation .",
    "a nd : yag laser beam at 1024 nm with 2 mm@xmath73 spot area and fluency 0.5 j @xmath74 is focused on the target at a repetition rate of 3 hz . the target is positioned at 5 cm distance from the beam . fe(se , te ) films 100 nm thick are deposited on caf@xmath0 single crystal substrates .",
    "further details may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite.the patterning of the nanostrips has been done through two different steps .",
    "first , micrometric strips are defined by standard photolithography and ion milling etching , then the stripline dimensions are further reduced by fib ( focused ion beam ) using ga - ions . for the measurements of the current - voltage characteristics",
    "the films were patterned in nanostrips @xmath75 @xmath13 m in length and width @xmath76 nm ( sample a ) and @xmath77 nm ( sample b ) .",
