    "this paper is concerned with the long - time behavior of a spherically symmetric self - gravitating massless scalar field .",
    "this toy - model of gravitational collapse has been intensively studied in the past leading to valuable insights about the validity of the weak cosmic censorship and no - hair conjectures . in particular",
    ", christodoulou proved that there are two generic endstates of evolution : minkowski spacetime for small initial data @xcite and schwarzschild black hole for large initial data @xcite . in both cases",
    "the upper bound for the rate of relaxation to the endstate inside the light cone is @xmath0 ( this was proved in @xcite for the dispersive solutions and recently by dafermos and rodnianski @xcite for the collapsing solutions ) . in view of these rigorous results",
    ", one might wonder what is the point of studying this problem again .",
    "our motivation is twofold .",
    "first , it is natural to ask whether the decay rates mentioned above are optimal and , if so , what are the corresponding amplitudes of the tails .",
    "this kind of _ quantitative _ information might be physically relevant ( provided that the intuitions gained in this toy - model carry over to more realistic situations ) , for example in assessing the possibility to detect the tails in future gravitational wave experiments .",
    "second and foremost , we want to clarify some longstanding confusion which is widespread throughout the vast relativity literature dealing with wave tails .",
    "to explain what this confusion is about we need to make some historical remarks .",
    "the study of wave tails in general relativity was launched in the seminal paper by price @xcite , where he gave a heuristic argument that a linear massless scalar field propagating on the fixed schwarzschild background decays as @xmath0 near timelike infinity .",
    "this result has been later rederived by different methods and confirmed numerically ( the works @xcite are particularly noteworthy ) , and finally proved rigorously in @xcite ( as a special decoupled case of the main theorem on the coupled einstein - scalar system ) . an especially influential contribution to the study of tails",
    "was made in a pair of papers by gundlach , price , and pullin @xcite . in the first paper , @xcite",
    ", they argued , using linearized theory , that the @xmath0 tail is due to the backscattering of the outgoing radiation off the curvature at large distances , and therefore it is present for any asymptotically flat solution , not only for black hole spacetimes . in the second paper , @xcite",
    ", gpp solved the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field equations numerically and found that , indeed , tails do develop for any initial data and moreover they decay as @xmath0 regardless of the endstate of evolution .",
    "this work was a significant step toward understanding of tails , however the fact that it appeared back to back with @xcite led also ( somewhat ironically ) to some confusion .",
    "namely , the remarkable agreement between the decay rates of tails observed numerically in the nonlinear evolution @xcite and the predictions of the linearized theory @xcite has been interpreted ( first rather cautiously by the authors themselves and later with increasing sureness in numerous citations of @xcite ) as if the linearized theory applies qualitatively ( and , as long as the power - law exponents of tails are concerned , even quantitatively ) in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we wish to point out that this interpretation is too naive .",
    "we claim that the tails observed in @xcite ( and later confirmed in @xcite with better numerical accuracy ) have genuinely _ nonlinear _",
    "origin for the dispersive solutions ( while for the collapsing solutions they have both linear and nonlinear ingredients ) . to substantiate our claim",
    "we compute the late - time behavior ( the decay rate _ and the amplitude _ of a tail ) of the self - gravitating scalar field in even - dimensional spacetime for small initial data using the nonlinear perturbative scheme developed in our recent papers @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this simple analytic computation is shown to agree extremely well with the results of high - precision numerical integration of the einstein - scalar field equations in four and six dimensions , however it does _ not _ agree with the linearized theory in dimensions higher than four .",
    "thus , the equality of the decay rates of linear and nonlinear tails seems to be a misleading idiosyncrasy of the einstein - scalar field equations in four dimensions .",
    "this paper is concerned only with subcritical initial data which lead to dispersion .",
    "work on the collapsing solutions is still in progress .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : eqs ] we construct a simple iterative scheme for solving the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field equations in even - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "this scheme is applied in section  [ sec : pert3 + 1 ] to derive the second - order approximation for the mass function and the third - order approximation for the scalar field in four dimensions .",
    "the analogous calculation in higher even dimensions is done in section  [ sec : pert5 + 1 ] . in section",
    "v we compare the nonlinear tails with the linear tails on the fixed schwarzschild background .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] contains numerical evidence confirming the analytic formulae for the tail from sections  [ sec : pert3 + 1 ] and [ sec : pert5 + 1 ] . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we make some final remarks .",
    "we consider the self - gravitating real massless scalar field @xmath1 in @xmath2 dimensions , where @xmath3 is odd .",
    "the einstein equations for the metric @xmath4 are @xmath5 and the scalar field satisfies the wave equation ( which is equivalent to @xmath6 ) @xmath7 we assume spherical symmetry , so @xmath8 , and use the following ansatz for the metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the round metric on the unit @xmath11dimensional sphere .",
    "we define also the mass function + @xmath12 . in these variables the einstein equations",
    "take the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and primes and dots denote partial derivatives with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . equation ( 6 ) , corresponding to @xmath17 , is sometimes referred to as the polar slicing condition . the wave equation ( [ we ] ) , which can be viewed as the integrability condition for equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , becomes @xmath18 we assume that initial data are small , smooth , and compactly supported ( the last assumption can be replaced by a suitable fall - off condition ) @xmath19 we make the following perturbative expansion @xmath20 substituting this expansion into the field equations and grouping terms with the same power of @xmath21 we get the iterative scheme which can be solved recursively .",
    "in this paper we consider perturbations about minkowski spacetime , so @xmath22 .",
    "at the first order the metric functions @xmath23 ( this follows from regularity at @xmath24 ) , while @xmath25 satisfies the flat space radial wave equation ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 the general spherically symmetric solution of equation ( [ box_phi1 ] ) in odd spatial dimensions @xmath28 is given by a superposition of outgoing and ingoing waves @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the retarded and advanced times , respectively ( the superscript in round brackets denotes the @xmath33-th derivative ) .",
    "note that for compactly supported initial data the generating function @xmath34 can be chosen to have compact support as well ( this condition determines @xmath34 uniquely ) .    at the second order @xmath35 , hence @xmath36 ( because it has zero initial data ) , while the metric functions satisfy the following equations @xmath37 we postpone the discussion of this system to the next section and proceed now to the third order , where we have @xmath38 to solve this equation we use the duhamel formula for the solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath39 with zero initial data @xmath40 where @xmath41 are legendre polynomials of degree @xmath42 ( recall that @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 ( note that @xmath45 within the integration range ) . applying this formula to equation ( [ box_phi3 ] ) , using null coordinates @xmath46 and",

    "this calculation will be done in the next section . having that",

    "first , the iteration has no chance to converge ( _ _ cf.__@xcite ) so our perturbation series is only asymptotic .",
    "second , already the third - order approximation shows excellent agreement with numerical results ( see section  vi ) .",
    "in this section , written mainly for the benefit of the reader who is not interested in higher dimensions , we follow the general strategy sketched above to present a detailed calculation of the third - order iterate @xmath55 in three spatial dimensions . in the next section",
    "we shall repeat this calculation for any odd spatial dimension @xmath3 .    for @xmath65 (",
    "hence @xmath66 ) , the solution ( [ phi1],[phi1retadv ] ) of the free wave equation takes the form @xmath67 where the function @xmath34 is uniquely determined by the initial data . substituting ( [ phil=0 ] ) into ( [ m2prime3 + 1 ] ) and integrating , we get @xmath68 where we used that @xmath69 , which follows from regularity of initial data at the origin and ( [ m2dot3 + 1 ] ) . here and in the following we use",
    "repeatedly the fact that @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath51 being the radius of a ball on which the initial data ( [ i d ] ) are supported . to describe the behavior of @xmath72 near the lightcone it is convenient to use the null coordinate @xmath31 instead of @xmath16 , and rewrite ( [ m2f ] ) as @xmath73 next , using the gauge freedom to set @xmath74 and integrating equation ( [ beta2prime3 + 1 ] ) , we get @xmath75 the first integral can be integrated by parts giving @xmath76 in order to determine the tail of @xmath77 we need only two leading terms in the expansion of the above formula in the inverse powers of @xmath15 .",

    "more concretely , for @xmath81 we have @xmath114 hence for @xmath115 @xmath116 and therefore @xmath117 which gives rise to the price tail @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath119 we have ( see @xcite ) @xmath120 which implies that for large @xmath107 @xmath121 a remarkable feature of this effective potential is the absence of a term proportional to  @xmath122 .",

    "in order to verify the above analytic predictions we solved numerically the initial value problem ( [ h - constraint]-[id ] ) for various initial data . to this end we rewrite the wave equation ( [ we2 ] ) as a pair of two first order equations for auxiliary fields @xmath127 and @xmath128 : @xmath129 we solve these equations with fourth - order accurate runge - kutta time stepping using finite differencing in space . at each time step",
    "we update the metric functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 by integrating the hamiltonian constraint ( [ h - constraint ] ) and the slicing condition ( [ s - condition ] ) with fourth - order runge - kutta method . to ensure regularity at the origin we impose the boundary conditions @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which are implemented by @xmath134 and @xmath135 being odd and even functions of @xmath15 , respectively . to avoid the contamination of the tail by spurious reflections from the outer boundary of the computational grid we place that boundary far away and compute the solution only inside the domain of dependence of the initial surface . as was pointed out in @xcite , a reliable numerical computation of tails",

    "if a weak self - gravitating scalar field decayed at this rate , its tail would be hidden under an artificial tail generated by a ghost potential unless the tenth or higher order discretization is used . ] . to eliminate high - frequency numerical instabilities we add a small amount of artificial dissipation @xcite , that is after each time step advancing solution @xmath139 from @xmath16 to @xmath140 on a grid with @xmath141 ) mesh we add the kreiss - oliger dissipative term @xmath142 , where ( for consistency with @xmath143-order finite difference scheme ) @xmath144 is a finite - difference operator of order @xmath145 of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is of order of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "finally , to suppress the accumulation of round - off errors at late times our codes were run in 128-bit precision . for the above reasons the accurate numerical simulations of tails , albeit straightforward , are computationally expensive even in spherical symmetry .",
    "the numerical results presented here correspond to initial data generated by the function ( see ( [ phi1retadv ] ) ) @xmath150 for different values of @xmath21 . for these initial data our third - order approximation ( 44 )",
    "yields the following asymptotic behavior at timelike infinity @xmath151 and @xmath152 in fig .",

    "using the third - order perturbation method we derived explicit formulae for the late - time tail ( the decay rate _ and _ the amplitude ) of a spherically symmetric , self - gravitating massless scalar field for solutions starting from small initial data .",
    "we verified that these formulae are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical integration of the einstein - scalar field equations in four and six dimensions .",
    "our results show that the tail has genuinely _ nonlinear _ origin and should not be mistaken with the linear tail coming from the backscattering off the schwarzschild potential .",
    "it seems to us that this distinction between linear and nonlinear tails has not been widely recognized in the past which is probably due to the fact that in four - dimensional spacetimes these two different tails decay at the same rate @xmath0 . to demonstrate that this coincidence is an idiosyncrasy of four dimensions",
    ", we computed both kinds of tails in @xmath2 dimensions for @xmath28 ( @xmath157 ) and showed that the linear and nonlinear tails decay at different rates : @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "this illustrates how viewing the dimension of a spacetime as a parameter may help understand which features of general relativity depend crucially on our world being four dimensional and which ones are general",
    ".    it would be interesting to generalize the results of this paper to collapsing solutions where the endstate of evolution is a black hole .",
    "the studies in this direction are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we expect that in this case the tail has both linear and nonlinear contributions with the latter being qualitatively the same as for dispersive solutions described above .",
    "note that the analogous perturbative calculation of tails is much harder on the black hole background because two basic tools that we used above , huygens principle and the explicit expression for duhamel s formula , are missing . for dispersive solutions these tools allowed us to compute the third - order perturbation in a shamelessly explicit way , however , from the perspective of generalizing the results to collapsing solutions , it is instructive to redo this calculation in an asymptotic manner keeping track of only leading order terms in the perturbative equations .",
    "such an efficient calculation , which gives additional insight into the mechanism of some cancelations in our asymptotic expansions , has been done recently by szpak @xcite and will appear as a comment to this paper .",
