    "in the daily life we encounter many biological , industrial or geological fluids that do not satisfy the newtonian assumption , i.e. , the linear dependence between the stress tensor and the deformation tensor .",
    "these fluids belong to the class of the non - newtonian fluids . in order to describe such complex fluids the stress tensor",
    "is represented as a sum of the viscous  ( newtonian ) part and the extra stress due to the polymer contribution .    in literature",
    "we can find several models that are employed to describe various aspects of complex viscoelastic fluids .",
    "one of the well - known viscoelastic models is the oldroyd - b model , which is derived from the hookean dumbbell model with a linear spring force law .",
    "the model is a system of equations for the velocity , the pressure and the extra stress tensor , cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "numerical schemes for the oldroyd - b type models have been studied by many authors .",
    "for example , we can find a finite difference scheme based on the reformulation of the equation for the extra stress tensor by using the log - conformation representation in fattal and kupferman  @xcite , free energy dissipative lagrange ",
    "galerkin schemes with or without the log - conformation representation in boyaval et al .",
    "@xcite , finite element schemes using the idea of the generalized lie derivative in lee and xu  @xcite and lee et al .",
    "@xcite , and further related numerical schemes and computations in  @xcite and references therein . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", however , there are no results on error estimates of numerical schemes for the oldroyd - b model . as for the simplified oldroyd - b model with no convection terms picasso and rappaz  @xcite and bonito et al .",
    "@xcite have given error estimates for stationary and non - stationary problems , respectively .",
    "the development of stable and convergent numerical methods for the oldroyd - b type models , especially in the elasticity - dominated case , is still an active research area .    in this paper ,",
    "part  i , and the forthcoming paper  @xcite , part ii , we consider the so - called peterlin viscoelastic model , which is a system of the flow equations and an equation for the conformation tensor , cf .",
    "@xcite . in  @xcite peterlin",
    "proposed a mean - field closure according to which the average of the elastic force over thermal fluctuations is replaced by the value of the force at the mean - squared polymer extension .",
    "more precisely , instead of the nonlinear spring force law  @xmath0 that acts in polymer dumbbells the peterlin approximation @xmath1 is applied , where @xmath2 is the vector connecting the dumbbell beads and @xmath3 is the spring constant .",
    "that means , that the length of the spring in the spring constant @xmath3 is replaced by the average length of the spring @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , we can derive an evolution equation for the conformation tensor @xmath5 , which is in a closed form , cf .",
    "note that in literature one can also find the peterlin approximation in the context of finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) dumbbell model , which was subsequently termed the fene - p model , cf .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    "the denominator of the fene force of the corresponding kinetic model is replaced by the mean value of the elongation yielding the macroscopic fene - p model . on the other hand ,",
    "renardy recently proposed a general macroscopic constitutive model , that is motivated by peterlin dumbbell theories with a nonlinear spring law for an infinitely extensible spring , see renardy  @xcite and a recent paper by lukov - medviov et al .",
    "@xcite , where the global existence of weak solutions has been obtained .",
    "the diffusive peterlin viscoelatisc model studied in the present paper has been obtained by a particular choice of these general constitutive functions .",
    "this model has been studied analytically by lukov - medviov et al .",
    "@xcite , where the global existence of weak solutions and the uniqueness of regular solutions have been proved .",
    "let us mention that , even when the velocity field is given , the equation for the conformation tensor in the peterlin model is still nonlinear , while the oldroyd - b model is linear with respect to the extra stress tensor .",
    "hence , we can say that the nonlinearity of the peterlin model is stronger than that of the oldroyd - b model . as a starting point of the numerical analysis of the peterlin model",
    ", we consider the oseen - type model , where the velocity of the material derivative is replaced by a known one , in order to concentrate on the treatment of nonlinear terms arising from the elastic stress .    our aim is to develop a stabilized lagrange ",
    "galerkin method for the peterlin viscoelastic model .",
    "it consists of the method of characteristics and brezzi ",
    "pitkranta s stabilization method  @xcite for the conforming linear elements .",
    "the method of characteristics yields the robustness in convection - dominated flow problems , and the stabilization method reduces the number of degrees of freedom in computation . in our recent works by notsu and tabata  @xcite the stabilized lagrange ",
    "galerkin method has been applied successfully for the oseen , navier  stokes and natural convection problems and optimal error estimates have been proved .",
    "we establish the numerical analysis of the stabilized lagrange ",
