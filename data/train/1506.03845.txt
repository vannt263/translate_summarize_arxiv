    "transiting exoplanets offer opportunities to explore the compositions , atmospheres , and orbital dynamics of planets beyond the solar system . the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( )",
    "is a nasa - sponsored explorer mission that will monitor several hundred thousand sun - like and smaller stars for transiting planets @xcite .",
    "the brightest dwarf stars in the sky are the highest priority for because they facilitate follow - up measurements of the planet masses and atmospheres .",
    "after launch ( currently scheduled for late 2017 ) , will spend two years observing nearly the entire sky using four wide - field cameras .",
    "previous wide - field transit surveys , such as hat @xcite , tres @xcite , xo @xcite , wasp @xcite , and kelt @xcite , have been conducted with ground - based telescopes .",
    "these surveys have been very successful in finding giant planets that orbit bright host stars , but they have struggled to find planets smaller than neptune because of the obstacles to achieving fine photometric precision beneath the earth s atmosphere .",
    "in contrast , the space missions _",
    "@xcite and @xcite achieved outstanding photometric precision , but targeted relatively faint stars within restricted regions of the sky . this has made it difficult to measure the masses or study the atmospheres of the small planets discovered by _",
    "corot _ and , except for the brightest systems in each sample .    aims to combine the merits of wide - field surveys with the fine photometric precision and long intervals of uninterrupted observation that are possible in a space mission .",
    "compared to , will examine stars that are generally brighter by 3  magnitudes over a solid angle that is larger by a factor of 400 . however , in order to complete the survey within the primary mission duration of two years , will not monitor stars for nearly as long as did ; it will mainly be sensitive to planets with periods @xmath520 days .",
    "this paper presents simulations of the population of transiting planets that will detect and the population of eclipsing binary stars that produce photometric signals resembling those of transiting planets .",
    "these simulations were originally developed to inform the design of the mission .",
    "they are also being used to plan the campaign of ground - based observations required to distinguish planets from eclipsing binaries as well as follow - up measurements of planetary masses and atmospheres . in the future",
    ", these simulations could inform proposals for an extended mission .",
    "pioneering work on calculating the yield of all - sky transit surveys was carried out by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite simulated in greater detail the planet yield for several ground - based and space - based transit surveys , but not including ( which had not yet been selected by nasa ) . @xcite",
    "considered specifically , but those calculations were based on an earlier design for the mission with different choices for the observing interval and duty cycle , the number of cameras and collecting area , and other key parameters . furthermore , the occurrence rates of planets have since been clarified by the _ kepler",
    "_ mission .",
    "we have therefore built our simulation from scratch rather than adapting this previous work .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows :    section  [ sec : pre ] provides an overview of and the types of stars that will be searched for transiting planets .    sections  [ sec : catalog]-[sec : best ] present our model for the relevant stellar and planetary populations .",
    "section  [ sec : catalog ] describes the properties and luminosity function of the stars in our simulation .",
    "section [ sec : eclip ] describes the assignment of transiting planets and eclipsing binary companions to these stars .",
    "section  [ sec : best ] combines these results to forecast the properties of the brightest transiting planet systems on the sky , regardless of how they might be detected .",
    "this information helps to set expectations for the yield of any wide - field transit survey , and for the properties of the most favorable transiting planets for characterization .",
    "sections  [ sec : inst]-[sec : fp ] then describe the detection of the simulated planets specifically with .",
    "section  [ sec : inst ] details our model for the photometric performance of the cameras . section  [ sec : yield ] presents the simulated detections of planets and their properties .",
    "section  [ sec : yield ] also shows the detections of astrophysical false - positives , and section  [ sec : fp ] investigates the possibilities for distinguishing them from planets using data and supplementary data from ground - based telescopes .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : followup ] discusses the prospects for following up the planets to study their masses and atmospheres .",
    "employs four refractive cameras , each with a field of view of  @xmath6   imaged by an array of four 2k@xmath62k charge - coupled devices ( ccd ) .",
    "this gives a pixel scale of .",
    "the four camera fields are stacked vertically to create a combined field that is 24@xmath7 wide and 96@xmath7 tall , captured by 64  mpixels .",
    "each camera has an entrance pupil diameter of 105  mm and an effective collecting area of after accounting for transmissive losses in the lenses and their coatings .",
    "( the relative spectral response functions of the camera and ccd will be considered separately . )",
    "each camera will acquire a new image every 2 seconds .",
    "the readout noise , for which the design goal has a root - mean - square ( rms ) level of 10  @xmath8  pix@xmath9 , is incurred with every 2  sec image .",
    "this places the read noise at or below the zodiacal photon - counting noise , which ranges from 10 - 16  @xmath8  pix@xmath9 rms for a 2  sec integration time ( see section  [ sec : zodi ] ) .",
    "due to limitations in data storage and telemetry , it will not be possible to transmit all the 2  sec images back to earth . instead , will stack these images to create two basic data products with longer effective exposure times .",
    "first , the subset of pixels that surround several hundred thousand pre - selected `` target stars '' will be stacked at a 2  min cadence .",
    "second , the full - frame images ( `` ffis '' ) will be stacked at a 30  min cadence .",
    "the selection of the target stars will be based on the detectability of small planets ; this described further in section  [ sec : target_selection ] .",
    "the ffis will allow a wider range of stars to be searched for transits , and they will also enable many other scientific investigations that require time - domain photometry of bright sources .      will observe from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the earth . over two years",
    ", it will observe the sky using 26 pointings .",
    "two spacecraft orbits (  days ) are devoted to each pointing .",
    "because the cameras are fixed to the spacecraft , the spacecraft must re - orient for every pointing .",
    "the pointings are spaced equally in ecliptic longitude , and they are positioned such that the top camera is centered on the ecliptic pole and the bottom camera reaches down to an ecliptic latitude of 6@xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : npoint ] shows the hemispherical coverage resulting from this arrangement .",
    "the spectral response of the cameras is limited at its red end by the quantum efficiency of the ccds .",
    "employs the mit lincoln laboratory ccid-80 detector , a back - illuminated ccd with a depletion depth of 100  @xmath11 m .",
    "this relatively deep depletion allows for sensitivity to wavelengths slightly longer than 1000  nm .    at its blue end",

    "we find that @xmath25 corresponds to a flux of @xmath29  erg  s@xmath9  @xmath27 , and a photon flux of @xmath30  ph  s@xmath9  @xmath27 .    by repeating the calculation for different template spectra from the @xcite library",
    ", we obtain the photon fluxes for stars of other spectral types .",
    "these are shown in table  [ tbl : phot ] . to facilitate comparisons with the standard johnson - cousins @xmath31 band ( which is nearly centered within the @xmath24-band ) , table  [ tbl : phot ] also provides synthetic @xmath32 colors .",
    "we note that the @xmath32 color for an a0v star is @xmath33 , which is equal to the apparent @xmath31 magnitude defined for vega .",
    "the most important stellar characteristics that affect planet detectability are apparent magnitude and stellar radius . here",
    "we provide a simple calculation for the limiting apparent magnitude ( as a function of stellar radius ) that permits to detect planets smaller than neptune ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this gives an overview of _ tess _",
    "s planet detection capabilities and establishes the necessary depth of our more detailed simulations of the population of nearby stars .",
    "we assume the noise in the photometric observations to be the quadrature sum of read noise and the photon - counting noise from the target star and the zodiacal background ( see section  [ sec : noise ] for the more comprehensive noise model ) .",
    "we require a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath35 for detection ( see section  [ sec : threshold ] for the rationale ) .",
    "we assume that the total integration time during transits is 6  hours , which may represent two or more transits of shorter duration .",
    "using these assumptions , figure  [ fig : ikdet ] shows the limiting apparent magnitude as a function of stellar radius at which transiting planets of various sizes can be detected .    to gauge the necessary depth of the detailed simulations , we consider the detection of small planets around two types of stars represented in figure  [ fig : ikdet ] , a sun - like star and an m dwarf with @xmath363200 k. these two choices span the range of spectral types that will prioritize ; stars just larger than the sun give transit depths that are too shallow , and dwarf stars just cooler than 3200 k are too faint in the bandpass .    for the sun - like star , a 4  @xmath37 planet produces a transit depth of 0.13% . the limiting magnitude for transits to be detectable is about @xmath38 .",
    "this also corresponds to @xmath39 and a maximum distance of 290  pc , assuming no extinction .    for the m dwarf with @xmath40  3200 k , we assume @xmath41 , based on the dartmouth stellar evolution database ( dotter et al .",
    "2008 ) for solar metallicity and an age of 1  gyr .",
    "since dressing & charbonneau ( 2015 ) found that m dwarfs very rarely have close - in planets larger than 3  @xmath4 , we consider a planet of this size rather than 4  @xmath4 . at 3  @xmath4 ,",
    "the transit depth is 3.1% and the limiting apparent magnitude for detection is @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath43 and a maximum distance of 120 pc , assuming no extinction .",
    "    a similar calculation can be carried out for eclipsing binary stars .",
    "some target stars will turn out to be eclipsing binaries , and others will be blended with faint binaries in the background . the maximum eclipse depth for an eclipsing binary is approximately 50% , which occurs when two identical stars undergo a total eclipse . assuming the period is 1  day , and that observes the system for  days , the limiting apparent magnitude for detection of the eclipse signals is @xmath44 , corresponding to many kiloparsecs .",
    "to summarize , is sensitive to small planets around sun - like stars within @xmath45300  pc . for m dwarfs ,",
    "the search distance is @xmath45100  pc . ",
    "eclipsing binaries can be detected across the milky way .",
    "these considerations set the required depth of our simulations of the stellar population , which must also take into account the structure of the galaxy and extinction .",
    "due to the wide range of apparent magnitudes that we need to consider , and the sensitivity of transit detections to stellar radii , we use a synthetic stellar population rather than a real catalog . the basis for our stellar population",
    "is trilegal , an abbreviation for the tridimensional model of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "trilegal is a monte carlo population synthesis code that models the milky way with four components : a thin disk , a thick disk , a halo , and a bulge .",
    "each of these components contains stars with the same initial mass function but with a different spatial distribution , star formation rate , and age - metallicity relation . for stars with masses",
    "0.2 - 7  @xmath46 , trilegal uses the padova evolutionary tracks @xcite to determine the stellar radius , surface gravity , and luminosity as a function of age . for stars less massive than 0.2  @xmath46",
    ", trilegal uses a brown dwarf model @xcite .",
    "apparent magnitudes in various photometric bands are computed using a spectral library drawing upon several theoretical and empirical sources .",
    "a disk extinction model is used to redden the apparent magnitudes depending on the location of the star .",
    "trilegal does not include the magellanic clouds , nor does it model any star clusters .",
    "the star counts predicted by the trilegal model were originally calibrated against the deep multicolor survey ( dms ) and eso imaging survey ( eis ) of the south galactic pole .",
    "the model was also found to be consistent with the eis coverage of the chandra deep field south @xcite .",
    "more recently , trilegal was updated and re - calibrated against the shallower 2mass and hipparcos catalogs while maintaining agreement with the dms and eis catalogs @xcite .    given a specified line of sight and solid angle , trilegal returns a magnitude - limited catalog of simulated stars , including properties such as mass , age , metallicity , surface gravity , distance , and extinction .",
    "apparent magnitudes are reported in the sloan @xmath47 , 2mass @xmath48 , and bandpasses ; at our request , l. girardi kindly added the bandpass to trilegal . when necessary , we translate between the sloan and johnson - cousins filters using the transformations for population i stars provided by @xcite .",
    "we find it necessary to adjust the properties of the population of low - mass stars ( @xmath49 ) to bring them into satisfactory agreement with more recent determinations of the absolute radii and luminosity function of these stars .",
    "these modifications are described in sections  [ sec : dwarfs ] and [ sec : lf ] .",
    "in addition , we employ our own model for stellar multiplicity that is described in section [ sec : mult ] .",
    "the trilegal simulation is accessed through a web - based interface .",
    "we use the default input parameters for the simulation ( table [ tbl : trilegal ] ) ; the _ post facto _ adjustments that we make to dwarf properties , binarity , and the disk luminosity function are discussed below .",
    "the runtime of a trilegal query is limited to 10 minutes , so we build an all - sky catalog by performing repeated queries over regions with small solid angles .",

    "for the 164 tiles closest to the galactic disk and bulge , the stellar surface density is too large for the necessary trilegal computations to complete within the runtime limit . the high background level and high incidence of eclipsing binaries",
    "will also make these areas difficult to search for transiting planets , so we simply omit these tiles from consideration .",
    "this leaves 2908 tiles covering 95@xmath59 of the sky .    for each of the 2908 sightlines through the centers of tiles ,",
    "we make three queries to trilegal :    1 .",
    "the `` bright catalog '' with @xmath60 and a solid angle of 6.7  deg .",

    "the full solid angle of 13.4 deg@xmath50 can not be simulated due to the 10-minute maximum runtime of the simulation .",
    "instead , we simulate a 6.7  deg@xmath50 field and simply duplicate each star in the catalog .",
    "once duplicated , we assign coordinates to each star randomly from a probability distribution that is spatially uniform across the entire tile . across all of the tiles",
    ", this catalog contains stars .",
    "2 .   the `` intermediate catalog '' with @xmath44 and a solid angle of 0.134 deg@xmath50 .",
    "this is intended to include stars for which would be able to detect a deep eclipse of a binary star .",
    "we use this catalog to assign blended background binaries to the target stars in the bright catalog and also to evaluate background fluxes .",
    "this deeper query is limited to a smaller solid angle ( 1/100th of the area of the tile ) to limit computational time .",
    "the simulation then re - samples from these stars 100 times when assigning background stars to the target stars .",
    "we also restrict this catalog to @xmath62 in the simulation to avoid double - counting stars from the bright catalog . across all tiles ,",
    "this catalog contains @xmath63 stars .",
    "3 .   the `` faint catalog '' with @xmath64 and a solid angle of 0.0134  deg@xmath50 .",
    "this is used only to calculate background fluxes due to unresolved background stars .",
    "the limiting magnitude is not critical because the surface brightness due to unresolved stars is dominated by stars at the brighter end rather than the fainter end of the population of unresolved stars .",
    "stars from this catalog are re - sampled 1000 times . across all tiles ,",
    "this catalog contains @xmath65 stars .",
    "low - mass dwarf stars are of particular importance for because they are abundant in the solar neighborhood and their small sizes facilitate the detection of small transiting planets . although the trilegal model is designed to provide simulated stellar populations with realistic distributions in spatial coordinates , mass , age , and metallicity , we noticed that the radii of low - mass stars for a given luminosity or @xmath66 in the trilegal output were smaller than have been measured in recent observations or calculated in recent theoretical models .",
    "figure  [ fig : rmi ] illustrates the discrepancy .",
    "it compares the radius - magnitude relation employed by trilegal with that of the more recent dartmouth models @xcite as well as empirical data based on optical interferometry of field stars and analysis of eclipsing binary stars .",
    "the interferometric radius measurements are from @xcite .",
    "the measurements based on eclipsing binaries are from the compilation of @xcite that has since been maintained by j.  southworth .",
    "we also include the systems tabulated by @xcite in their study of kepler-16 .",
    "the published data specify @xmath66 rather than absolute @xmath31 magnitude ; in preparing figure  [ fig : rmi ] , we converted @xmath66 into absolute @xmath31 using the temperature - magnitude data compiled by e.  mamajek http://www.pas.rochester.edu/@xmath67emamajek/eem_dwarf_ubvijhk_colors_teff.txt ] and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rmi ] shows that the dartmouth stellar - evolutionary models give better agreement with measured radii , especially those from interferometry .",
    "therefore , to bring the key properties of the simulated stars into better agreement with the data , we replaced the trilegal output for the apparent magnitudes and radii of low - mass stars ( 0.15 - 0.78  @xmath46 ) with the properties calculated with the dartmouth models . to make these replacements",
    ", we use a trilateral interpolation in mass , age , and metallicity to determine the absolute magnitudes , @xmath66 , and radii from the grid of dartmouth models . for simplicity , we assume the helium abundance is solar for all stars .",
    "furthermore , motivated by @xcite , we only select the grid points that adhere to the following one - to - one relation between [ @xmath68/fe ] and [ fe / h ] : @xmath69 } \\geq 0 \\iff [ \\alpha/\\mathrm{fe } ] = 0.0\\ ] ] @xmath69 } = -0.05 \\iff [ \\alpha/\\mathrm{fe } ] = + 0.2\\ ] ] @xmath69 } \\leq -0.1 \\iff [ \\alpha/\\mathrm{fe } ] = + 0.4\\ ] ]    in calculating the apparent magnitudes of the stars with properties overwritten from the dartmouth models , we preserve the distance modulus from trilegal and apply reddening corrections using the same extinction model that trilegal uses .",
    "trilegal reports the extinction @xmath70 for each star , and for bands other than @xmath71 , we use the @xmath72 ratios from @xcite .",
    "binary companions to the target stars have three important impacts on the detection of transiting planets .",
    "first , whenever a `` target star '' is really a binary , there are potentially two stars that can be searched for transiting planets . the effective size of the search sample is thereby increased .",
    "however , there is a second effect that decreases the effective size of the search sample : if there is a transit around one star , the constant light from the unresolved companion diminishes the observed transit depth , making it more difficult to detect the transit .",
    "even if the transit is still detectable , the radius of the planet may be underestimated due to the diminished ( or `` diluted '' ) depth .",
    "the third effect is that a planet around one member of a close binary has a limited range of periods within which its orbit would be dynamically stable .",
    "furthermore , eclipsing binaries that are blended with target stars , or that are bound to the target star in hierarchical triple or quadruple systems , can produce eclipses that resemble planetary transits . because eclipsing binaries produce larger signals than planetary transits",
    ", the population of eclipsing binaries needs to be simulated down to fainter apparent magnitudes than the target stars .    to capture these effects in our simulations , we need a realistic description of stellar multiplicity .",
    "we are guided by the review of @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity fraction ( mf ) is defined as the fraction of systems that have more than one star ; it is the sum of the binary fraction ( bf ) , triple fraction ( tf ) , quadruple fraction ( qf ) , and so on .",
    "our simulations consider systems with up to 4 stars .    the mf has been observed to increase with the mass of the primary , which is reflected in our simulation . in our trilegal queries ,",
    "_ every _ star is originally a binary , and we decide randomly whether to keep the secondary based on the primary mass and the mf values in table  [ tbl : binary ] .",
    "next , we turn a fraction of the remaining binaries into triple and quadruple systems according to the desired tf and qf .",
    "the mf , tf , and qf are adopted as follows :    1 .   for primary stars of mass 0.1 - 0.6  @xmath46",
    ", we adopt the mf of 26% from @xcite . for systems with @xmath73 or 4 components ,",

    ". primary masses of 0.8 - 1.0  @xmath46 have a mf of 41@xmath59 , while primary masses of 1.0 - 1.4  @xmath46 have a mf of 50@xmath59 .",
    "the fraction of higher - order systems is @xmath75 for both ranges @xcite .",
    "3 .   for stars of mass 0.6 - 0.8  @xmath76",

    "the fraction of higher - order systems is @xmath77 .",
    "4 .   for primaries more massive than 1.4  @xmath46 , we use the results for a stars from @xcite , giving a mf of 75% .",
    "we assume that the fraction of higher - order systems is @xmath77 .",
    "next , we consider the properties of the binary systems .",
    "trilegal originally creates binaries with a uniform distribution in the mass ratio between the secondary and the primary , @xmath78 , between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "however , a more realistic distribution in @xmath78 is @xmath79 where the power - law index @xmath80 is allowed to vary with the primary mass , as specified in table  [ tbl : binary ] .",
    "when we select the binary systems to obtain the desired mf , we choose the systems to re - create this distribution in @xmath78 over the range 0.1@xmath811.0 .",
    "the period @xmath82 is not specified by trilegal , so we assign it from a log - normal distribution .",
    "@xcite parametrizes the distribution in terms of the mean semimajor axis ( @xmath83 ) and the standard deviation in @xmath84 ; both parameters vary with the primary mass as shown in table  [ tbl : binary ] .",
    "we convert from @xmath83 to @xmath85 with kepler s third law .",
    "the orbital inclination @xmath86 is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution in @xmath87 .",
    "the orbital eccentricity @xmath88 is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution , between zero and a maximum value @xmath89\\right)+\\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is specified in days , to provide a good fit to the range of eccentricities shown in figure  14 of @xcite .",
    "the argument of pericenter @xmath90 is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution between 0@xmath10 and 360@xmath10 .",
    "for the systems that are designated as triples , we assign the properties using the approach originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "although there is no physical reason why this method should work well , it has been found to reproduce the multiplicity properties of a sample of _ hipparcos _ stars @xcite .",
    "first , we create a binary according to the prescriptions described above with a period @xmath91 .",
    "then , we split the primary or secondary star ( chosen randomly ) into a new pair of stars .",
    "the new pair of stars orbit their barycenter with a higher - order period @xmath92 according to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "this procedure ensures that @xmath92 is @xmath95 the orbital period of the original binary system , a rudimentary method for enforcing dynamical stability .",
    "the mass of a star is conserved when it is split , so the barycenter of the original binary remains the same , and the orbital period of the companion star about this barycenter is unchanged .",
    "the original prescription given by @xcite assigns @xmath91 from a distribution peaking at @xmath96 days and allows the new period to vary over 5 decades . since our assumed distribution for @xmath97 peaks at a shorter period ( for stars @xmath51  @xmath46 )",
    ", we only allow the higher - order orbital period to vary over 2 decades in our implementation . in this way",
    ", we avoid generating unphysically short periods .",
    "the total mass of a new pair of stars is set equal to that of the original star , and the mass ratio @xmath78 is assigned in the following manner .",
    "the parent distribution of @xmath78 is taken from the sample of triples presented in figure  16 of @xcite .",
    "we model this distribution by setting @xmath98 for 23@xmath59 of the pairs and drawing @xmath78 from a normal distribution with @xmath99 for the other 77% of the pairs . finally ,",
    "for each star in a higher - order pair , we calculate the absolute and apparent magnitudes , radius , and @xmath66 from the new stellar mass in combination with the age and metallicity inherited from the original star .",
    "we do so using the same interpolation onto the dartmouth model grid described in section [ sec : dwarfs ] .",

    "we then return to each healpix tile individually , and we bin the stars by @xmath107 . using the ratio computed above for each @xmath107 bin , we select stars at random for duplication or deletion to bring the simulated lf into agreement with the empirical lf .",

    "however , m dwarfs are the faintest stars that will observe , so instrumental noise and background will dominate the photometric error of these targets .    since the photometric variations associated with stellar variability exhibit strong correlations on short timescales , we assume that the level of noise due to intrinsic variability is independent of transit duration : we do not adjust it according to @xmath114 as would be the case for white noise .",

    "their agreement with the simulated cumulative distributions suggest that some of the very brightest transiting systems have already been discovered .",
    "now that the simulated population of transiting planets and eclipsing binaries has been generated , the next step is to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the transits and eclipses when they are observed by .",
    "the signal is the fractional loss of light during a transit or an eclipse ( @xmath172 ) , and the noise ( @xmath173 ) is calculated over the duration of each event .",
    "the noise is the quadrature sum of all the foreseeable instrumental and astrophysical components .",
    "evaluation of the snr is partly based on the parameters of the cameras already described in section  [ sec : pre ] .",
    "we also need to describe how well the cameras can concentrate the light from a star into a small number of pixels .",
    "the same description will be used to evaluate the contribution of light from neighboring stars that is also collected in the photometric aperture .",

    "the synthetic images are also used to study the problem of background eclipsing binaries .",
    "transit - like events that are apparent in the total signal measured from the photometric aperture could be due to the eclipse of any star within the aperture . with only the photometric signal",
    ", there is no way to determine which star is eclipsing .",
    "if the timeseries of the @xmath174 and @xmath175 coordinates of the flux - weighted center of light ( the `` centroid '' ) is also examined , then in some cases , one can determine which star is undergoing eclipses . as shown in section  [ sec : centroid ] , background eclipsing binaries tend to produce larger centroid shifts during eclipses than transiting planets .",
    "the synthetic images allow us to calculate the centroid during and outside of transits and eclipses .",
    "the synthetic images are constructed from the _ pixel response function _ ( prf ) , which describes the fraction of light from a star that is collected by a given pixel .",
    "it is calculated by numerically integrating the _ point - spread function _ ( psf ) over the boundaries of pixels .",
    "the _ photometric aperture _ for a star is the collection of pixels over which the electron counts are summed to create the photometric signal ; they are selected to maximize the photometric snr of the target star . throughout this study",
    ", we assume that the pixel values are simply summed without any weighting factors .",
    "the lens uses seven elements with two aspheres to deliver a tight psf over a large focal plane and over a wide bandpass .",
    "due to off - axis and chromatic aberrations , the psf must be described as a function of field angle and wavelength .",
    "we calculate the psf at four field angles from the center ( 0@xmath7 ) to the corner ( 17@xmath7 ) of the field of view .",
    "chromatic aberrations arise both from the refractive elements of the camera and from the deep - depletion ccds absorbing redder photons deeper in the silicon .",
    "we calculate the psf for nine wavelengths , evenly spaced by 50  nm , between 625 and 1025  nm . these wavelengths are shown with dashed lines in figure [ fig : filt ] .",
    "these wavelengths also correspond to a set of bandpass filters that will be used in the laboratory to measure the performance of each flight camera .",
    "the lens has been modeled with the zemax ray - tracing software .",
    "we use the zemax model to trace 250,000 simulated rays through the camera optics for each field angle and wavelength .",
    "the model is set to the predicted operating temperature of @xmath176c .",
    "rays are propagated through the optics and then into the silicon of the ccd .",
    "a probabilistic model is used to determine the depth of travel in the silicon before the photons are converted to electrons .",
    "finally , the diffusion of the electrons within the remaining depth of silicon is modeled to arrive at the psf .    pointing errors from the spacecraft",
    "will effectively enlarge the psf because the 2  sec exposures are summed into 2  min stacks without compensating for these errors .",
    "the spacecraft manufacturer ( orbital sciences ) has provided a simulated time series of spacecraft pointing errors from a model of the spacecraft attitude control system . using two minutes of this time series , we offset the psf according to the pointing error and then stack the resulting time series of psfs .",
    "the root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude of the pointing error is @xmath177 , which is small in comparison to the pixel size and the full width half - maximum of the psf .",
    "thus , the impact of pointing errors on short timescales turns out to be minor .",
    "long - term drifts in the pointing of the cameras will also introduce photometric errors , but this effect is budgeted in the systematic error described in section  [ sec : instnoise ] .    limits in the manufacturing precision of cameras will also increase the size of the psf from its ideal value . in a monte carlo simulation drawing from the tolerances prescribed in the optical design ,",
    "the the fraction of the flux captured by the brightest pixel in the prf is reduced by @xmath178 in 80@xmath59 of cases . to capture this effect",
    ", we simply increase the size of the psf by @xmath179 to achieve the same reduction .    even after considering jitter and manufacturing errors ,",
    "the psf is still under - sampled by the 15  @xmath11 m pixels of the ccds .",
    "therefore , we must recalculate the prf for a given offset and orientation between the psf and the pixel boundaries .",
    "we numerically integrate the psf over a grid of @xmath180 pixels to arrive at the prf .",
    "we do so over a @xmath181 grid of sub - pixel centroid offsets and two different azimuthal orientations ( 0@xmath7 and 45@xmath7 ) with respect to the pixel boundaries . for the corner psf ( at a field angle of 17@xmath7 )",

    "[ fig : prf ] , we average over all of the centroid offsets and both azimuthal angles . for clarity ,",
    "only three of the field angles and three values of @xmath66 are shown .",
    "there is little change in the prf across the range of @xmath66 , but the prf degrades significantly at the corners of the field .      for each target star with eclipses or transits ,",
    "we create a synthetic image in the following manner .",
    "first , we determine the appropriate prf based on the star s color and location in the camera field .",
    "we calculate the field angle from its ecliptic coordinates and the direction in which the relevant camera is pointed .",
    "we randomly assign an offset between the star and the nearest pixel center , and we randomly assign an azimuthal orientation of either 0@xmath10 or 45@xmath10 .",
    "we then look up the nine wavelength - dependent prfs for the appropriate field angle , centroid offset , and azimuthal angle .",
    "the nine prfs are summed with weights according to the stellar effective temperature .",
    "the weight of a given prf is proportional to the stellar photon flux integrated over the wavelengths that the prf represents . outside of the main simulation",
    ", we considered a vega - normalized stellar template spectrum of each spectral type from the @xcite library .",
    "we multiplied each template spectrum by the spectral response function of the camera , and we integrated the photon flux for each of the nine prf bandpasses .",
    "next , we fitted a polynomial function to the relationship between the stellar effective temperatures and the photon flux in each bandpass . during the simulation ,",
    "the polynomial functions are used to quickly calculate the appropriate prf weights as a function of stellar effective temperature .    once the prfs are summed , the result is a synthetic @xmath180 -pixel image of each target star .",
    "we only consider the central @xmath182 pixels when determining the optimal photometric aperture ; the left panel of figure [ fig : imgs ] shows an example .    after synthesizing the image of each eclipsing or transiting target star ,",
    "a separate @xmath180 image is synthesized of all the relevant neighboring stars and companion stars .",
    "the neighboring stars are drawn from all three star catalogs described in section [ sec : catalog ] .",

    "the synthesized images are created in the same manner as described above : by weighting , shifting , and summing the prfs associated with each star .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : imgs ] shows an example .",
    "synthetic images are also created for the eclipsing binary systems drawn from the intermediate catalog , but a slightly different approach is taken .",
    "for each eclipsing binary , we search for any target stars within 6  pixels .",
    "if any are found , the brightest is added to the list of target stars with apparent transits or eclipses .",
    "separate synthetic images are created for the target star , the eclipsing binary , and the non - eclipsing neighboring stars .",
    "hierarchical binaries are treated in a similar fashion ; the non - eclipsing component is treated as the target star , and a separate synthetic image is created for the eclipsing pair so that its apparent depth can be diluted . while this approach may appear to strongly depend upon the somewhat arbitrary magnitude limits adopted for the different catalogs , this is not really the case .",
    "both the eclipsing binaries from the target catalog and the background eclipsing binaries from the intermediate catalog end up being diluted by neighboring stars drawn from all of the catalogs .      for each target star that is associated with an eclipse or transit ( whether it is due to the target star itself or a blended eclipsing binary ) , we select the pixels that provide the optimal photometric aperture from the central @xmath182 pixels of its synthetic image . starting with the three brightest pixels in the prf , we add pixels in order decreasing brightness one at a time . at each step , we sum the flux of the pixels from the synthetic image of target star and from the synthetic image of the neighboring stars .",
    "we also consider the read noise and zodiacal noise , which are discussed in section [ sec : noise ] . as the number of pixels in the photometric aperture increases , more photons",
    "are collected from the target star , and more noise is accumulated from the readout , sky background , and neighboring stars .",
    "the optimal photometric aperture maximizes the snr of the target star even if the eclipse is produced by a blended binary .",
    "we assume that the data will be analyzed with prior knowledge of the locations of neighboring stars ( but no prior knowledge of whether they eclipse ) .",
    "once the optimal aperture is determined , we calculate the dilution parameter @xmath183 , which is the factor by which the true eclipse or transit depth is reduced by blending with other stars in the photometric aperture . specifically , the dilution parameter is defined as the ratio of the total flux in the aperture from the neighboring stars ( @xmath184 ) and target star ( @xmath185 ) to the flux from the target star : @xmath186 for blended binaries and hierarchical systems , the denominator is replaced with the flux from the binary @xmath187 , and the target star becomes a source of dilution : @xmath188 with this definition , @xmath189 signifies an isolated system , and in general , @xmath190 .",

    "the least - squares best - fit has @xmath199 mag and @xmath200 mag .",
    "based on these results , we find that the zodiacal light collected in a 2  sec image ranges from 95 - 270  @xmath8  pix@xmath9 depending on ecliptic latitude . the photon - counting noise associated with this signal varies from 10 - 16  @xmath8  pix@xmath9 rms , as mentioned in section  [ sec : pre ] .",
    "the read noise of the ccds is assumed to be 10  @xmath8  pix@xmath9 rms in each 2  sec exposure , which is near or below the level of photon - counting noise from the zl .",
    "both the read noise and zl noise grow in proportion to the square root of the number of pixels used in the photometric aperture .",
    "our noise model for cameras also includes a systematic error term of 60  ppm  hr@xmath201 .",
    "this is an engineering requirement on the design rather than an estimate of a particular known source of error .",
    "we assume that the systematic error is uncorrelated and scales with the total observing time as @xmath114 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the systematic error grows larger than 60  ppm for timescales shorter than one hour , which is probably unrealistic ; however , this issue is not very relevant to our calculations because such timescales are shorter than the typical durations of transits and eclipses .",
    "it is thought that the systematic error of the cameras will primarily stem from pointing errors that couple to the photometry through non - uniformity in the pixel response .",
    "these pointing errors come from the attitude control system , velocity aberration , thermal effects , and mechanical flexure .",
    "in addition , long - term drifts in the camera electronics can contribute to the systematic error .",
    "the data reduction pipeline will use the same co - trending techniques that were used by the mission to mitigate these effects , but the exact level of residual error that will be able to achieve is unknown at this time .      stars with @xmath202 will saturate the innermost pixels of the prf during the 2-second exposures . for reference ,",
    "this saturation magnitude is identified with a dotted line in figure  [ fig : noise ] .",
    "these saturated stars represent of the target stars .",
    "as was the case with the ccds , the ccds are designed to conserve the charge that bleeds from saturated pixels , and do not use anti - blooming structures . since photometry of saturated stars with has achieved the photon - counting limit @xcite , we assume that the systematic error is the same for the saturated stars and the unsaturated stars .    while large photometric apertures will be needed to collect all of the charge that bleeds from saturated stars , the read and zodiacal noise are not important since the photometric precision will be dominated by photon - counting noise and systematic errors . because the photometric precision will not depend strongly upon the number of pixels used in the photometric aperture , we do not model the saturated stars differently in our simulation .",
    "typical back - illuminated ccds have depletion depths of 10 - 50  @xmath11 m .",
    "in contrast , the ccds have a 100 @xmath11 m depletion depth .",
    "this is desirable to enhance the quantum efficiency at long wavelengths , but it also makes the detectors more susceptible to cosmic rays ( crs ) since the pixel volume is larger and the maximum amount of charge collected per event can be larger .    to assess the effect of cosmic rays , we consider a typical cosmic ray flux of 5  events  s@xmath9  @xmath27 and minimally - ionizing events that deposit 100  @xmath8  @xmath11m@xmath9 within silicon .",
    "each pixel has an optical exposure time of 2  sec .",
    "the accumulated images also spend an average of 1  sec in the frame - store region of the ccd , where they are still vulnerable to cosmic rays . given these parameters , for each 2  min stack of values from one pixel ,",
    "there is a 10% chance of experiencing a cosmic ray event with an energy deposition above the combined read and zodiacal noise of 110  @xmath8 .",
    "the distribution in the energy deposition values has a peak near 1500  @xmath8 , which is comparable to the photon - counting noise of bright stars observed with 2  min cadence .",
    "electrons from cosmic rays will therefore add significantly to the photometric noise , but will not be easily detected in the 2  min or 30  min data products .",
    "cosmic rays are far more conspicuous in the 2  sec images .",
    "therefore , it is probably best to remove the contaminated pixel values before they are combined into the 2  min and 30  min stacks . the data handling unit on will apply a digital filter that rejects outlier values during the stacking process either periodically or adaptively .",
    "a possible side - effect of this filter , depending on the algorithm used , is a reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio to the degree that uncontaminated data is also rejected in the absence of cosmic rays .",
    "the exact algorithm that will be used to mitigate cosmic - ray noise is still being studied . for the present simulations we have budgeted for a 3@xmath59 loss in the snr . in the simulation code",
    ", we simply raise the detection threshold ( described in section [ sec : threshold ] ) by 3@xmath59 to compensate for the reduced snr , and we assume that there are no other residual effects from cosmic rays .",
    "the snr of transits or eclipses will depend critically on how long the star is observed .",
    "figure [ fig : npoint ] is a sky map showing the number of times that will point at a given location as a function of ecliptic coordinates . as noted above , the simulations assign coordinates to each star through a uniform random distribution across the healpix tile to which it belongs .",
    "the star s ecliptic coordinates are then converted to @xmath174 and @xmath175 pixel coordinates for each pointing .",
    "we tally the number of pointings for which the target falls within the field - of - view of a camera .",
    "the total amount of observing time is calculated as the total duration of all consecutive pointings .",
    "the duty cycle of observations must also be considered . at each orbital perigee , interrupts observations in order to transmit data to earth and perform other housekeeping operations .",
    "this takes approximately 0.6  days .",
    "we model this interruption in the simulation , so each 13.6-day spacecraft orbit actually results in 13.0 days of data .",

    "we do not model this effect since predicting their presence depends upon the specific launch date of .",
    "however , our simulations do show that if observations are interrupted near s orbital apogee in addition to its perigee , then the planet yields are approximately proportional to the duty cycle of observations .      the model for the detection process",
    "is highly simplified : we adopt a threshold for the signal - to - noise ratio , and we declare a signal to be detected if the total snr exceeds the threshold . in other words ,",
    "the detection probability is modeled as a step function of the computed snr .",
    "( the matched - filter technqiues of the pipeline probably have a smoother profile , such as a standard error function [ @xcite ] ) . for transiting planets ,",
    "all of the observed transits contribute to the total snr . for eclipsing binaries",
    ", we allow both the primary and secondary eclipses to contribute to the total snr .",
    "the choice of an appropriate snr threshold was discussed in detail by @xcite in the context of the mission .",
    "their criterion was that the threshold should be sufficiently high to prevent more than one `` detection '' from being a purely statistical fluke after analyzing all of the data from the entire mission .",
    "we adopt the same criterion here .",
    "since the number of astrophysical false positives is at least several hundred ( as discussed below ) , this criterion allows statistical false positives to be essentially ignored .    to determine the appropriate threshold",
    ", we use a separate monte carlo simulation of the transit search .",
    "we produce @xmath203 light curves containing uncorrelated , gaussian noise and analyze them for transits in a similar manner as will be done with real data .",
    "then , we find the snr threshold that results in approximately one statistical false positive .",
    "each light curve consists of 38,880 points , representing two -day pointings with 2-minute sampling .",
    "we chose a timeseries length of two pointings rather than one to account for the stars observed with overlapping pointings .    to search for transits , we scan through a grid of trial periods , times of transit , and transit durations",
    "at each grid point , we identify the data points belonging to the candidate transit intervals .",
    "the snr is computed as the mean of the in - transit data values divided by the uncertainty in the mean .",

    "we adopt a slightly higher threshold of in this paper .",
    "in addition , we only consider a transit or eclipse to be detected if two or more events are observed .",
    "we also record the single events that exceed the snr threshold , but we do not count them as `` detections '' in the tallies and the discussion that follows .",
    "the planets detected with a single transit generally have longer periods than the multiple - transit detections .",
    "it is also worth noting that may detect some single transits from the population of planets with periods longer than a year , which we have not simulated at all , because our sources for planet occurrence rates do not extend to such long periods .",
    "the single - transit detections may represent interesting opportunities to study the properties of more distant planets .",
    "however , they will require additional ground - based follow - up observations to determine the orbital period and discriminate against astrophysical or statistical false positives .      from the stars in the @xmath60 catalog",
    ", we must select the @xmath208 target stars for which pixel data will be saved and transmitted with 2  min time sampling . in our simulation ,",
    "the target stars are chosen according to the prospects for detecting the transits of small planets , which depend chiefly on stellar radius and apparent magnitude .    in the simulation",
    ", we have complete knowledge of the properties of each star , which makes it straightforward to determine whether a fiducial transiting planet with a given radius and period could be detected with .",
    "we adopt an orbital period of 20 days ; for each -day pointing that spends observing a star , we assume that 2 transits are observed .",
    "the stellar radius and mass are used to calculate the transit duration with a 20-day period , thereby determining the total exposure time during transits .",
    "then , we use the simplified noise model from section [ sec : maglim ] that considers the read noise and photon - counting noise of the star and zodiacal light .",
    "we then check to see if the fiducial transiting planet would be detectable with a signal - to - noise ratio exceeding of .",
    "the number of stars meeting this detection criterion depends strongly on the radius of the fiducial planet .",
    "starting from small values , we increase the radius until the number of stars for which the planet would be detectable is @xmath208 .",
    "this is achieved for @xmath209 . through this procedure ,",
    "the target star catalog is approximately complete for planets smaller than 2.25  @xmath4 with orbital periods shorter than 20  days .",
    "there is a higher density of target stars assigned near the ecliptic poles due to the longer duration of observations in those regions .    in selecting the target stars",
    ", we do not assume prior knowledge of whether a star is part of a multiple - star system .",
    "if it is , we assume that all components of the system fall within a single photometric aperture , and they are all observed at the 2  min cadence .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] illustrates the selection of the target stars on a hertzsprung - russell diagram . for clarity ,",
    "we show a magnitude - limited subsample ( @xmath210 ) of our `` bright '' catalog as well as a randomly - selected subsample of the @xmath208 target stars .",
    "nearly all main - sequence stars with @xmath211  k are selected as target stars .",
    "stars that are larger than the sun are only included if they have a sufficiently bright apparent magnitude .",
    "white dwarfs could also be interesting targets for , but we do not include them in our simulation because the occurrence rates of planets around white dwarfs is unknown .",
    "figure  [ fig : icteff ] shows the distribution of target stars as a function of effective temperature , along with their _ apparent _ @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "the distribution in effective temperature of the target stars is bimodal , with a sharp peak near 3400  k and a broader peak near 5500  k.    in reality , it will not be quite as straightforward to select the target stars for .",
    "while proper - motion surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) can readily distinguish red giants from dwarf stars , it is much more difficult to distinguish dwarfs from subgiant stars @xcite . ultimately , the selection of the target stars may rely on parallaxes from the ongoing _ gaia _ mission @xcite .",
    "errors in selecting the target stars might be mitigated by simply observing a larger number of stars at 2  min cadence .",
    "there is also the possibility of detecting transits in the full - frame images , which is described below .",
    "will record and downlink a continuous sequence of full - frame images ( ffis ) with an effective integration time of 30  min or shorter .",
    "transiting planets can still be detected with 30  min sampling , but the longer integration time of the ffis reduces the sensitivity to events with a short duration . our simulation estimates the yield of transiting planets from the ffis in the following fashion .",
    "first , we identify all the transiting or eclipsing stars that are not among the pre - selected @xmath208 target stars .",
    "we assign to each system a random phase between the beginning of a 30  min window and the beginning of an eclipse .",
    "next , we calculate the number of 30  min data points that are required to cover the transit or eclipse duration .",
    "the data points at the beginning and end of the series are omitted if they do not increase the signal - to - noise . finally , we compute the effective depth of the transit or eclipse by averaging over all of the 30  min data points spanning the event",
    ". this step can reduce the depth because some of the data points include time outside of the transit or eclipse .    for transits with durations shorter than 1 hour , the 30-minute integration time of the ffis causes the apparent transit duration to be lengthened and the apparent transit depth to become more shallow .",
    "however , the depths and durations of transits with longer durations are largely unaffected .",
    "the effects of time averaging on the uncertainties in transit parameters derived from light - curve fitting have been analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our calculated detection threshold of only ensures that no more than one statistical false positive is detected among the @xmath208 target stars . since",
    "many more stars can be searched for transits in the ffis , the number of statistical false - positives will be much greater than one if the same threshold is adopted .",
    "having calculated the snr for each eclipsing or transiting system , we determine that a system is `` detected '' if the snr  @xmath212 in the phase - folded light curve and at least 2 transits or eclipse events are observed .",
    "we thereby produce a simulated catalog of detected planets and false positives .",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] is a sky map in ecliptic coordinates of the simulated detections from one trial . figure  [ fig : baryield ] shows the tallies for each class of planet and false positive . for the @xmath208 target stars , the yields we show are the average over five trials of the mission ; for the full - frame images , the yields are reported from a single trial since the computation time is much longer for this case .",
    "the uncertainties that are printed in figure  [ fig : baryield ] ( for planets transiting the @xmath213 target stars ) are based on the two primary sources of statistical uncertainty : the poisson fluctuations in the number of detected planets and the statistical uncertainties in the planet occurrence rates ( which are partly due to poisson fluctuations in the _ kepler _ sample of detected planets ) .",
    "we propagate the uncertainties in the occurrence rates by running 100 trials of the simulation . in each trial , the occurrence rates were perturbed by adding random gaussian deviates to the quoted occurrence rate with the standard deviation set to the quoted uncertainty in the occurrence rate . in this way , the standard deviation in the number of planet detections across the 100 trials is essentially the quadrature sum of the poisson fluctuations and the uncertainties propagated from the input occurrence rates .",
    "poisson fluctuations are dominant for the categories of planets where the mean number of detected planets is small , such as habitable - zone planets .",
    "the preceding calculations do not take into account systematic uncertainties . among the sources of systematic uncertainty",
    "are the models of galactic structure and extinction , the stellar luminosity function , the stellar mass - radius - luminosity relations , and any bias in the planet occurrence rates .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to gauge the uncertainties in all of these inputs and the resulting impact on the planet yield .",
    "we can , however , make some general comments . we expect that the uncertainties in galactic structure and extinction will only be significant near the galactic plane , where it will be more difficult for _ tess _ to detect planets due to crowding .",
    "regarding the stellar luminosity function , it seems plausible that there are residual biases at the level of @xmath10810% , given that we found it necessary to adjust the model luminosity function by @xmath10830% across all absolute magnitudes to match the various sets of observational inputs . when coupled with uncertainties in the stellar mass - radius - luminosity relations",
    ", we would guess that the net impact on the planet detection statistics is at the level of @xmath10830% .",
    "regarding biases in the planet occurrence rates upon which our simulation is based , it seems plausible that they are of the same order as the reported statistical errors , which have a median of @xmath10840% across all planetary sizes and periods .",
    "therefore , the systematic uncertainties in the number of planet detections could be as large as 50% .",
    "the number of planet detections from the full - frame images is sufficiently large that the systematic uncertainties almost certainly dominate over the statistical uncertainties , and therefore , the results should probably be valid to within a factor of two .",
    "for the same reason , we have not reported statistical uncertainties for the yields of astrophysical false positives .",
    "in addition to the systematic uncertainties mentioned above , there are additional uncertainties arising from the models for the stellar multiplicity fraction , mass ratio distribution , and eccentricity / period distributions .",

    ", we use a value of @xmath228 for all stars , which is thought to be appropriate for stars with convective envelopes @xcite .",
    "the formal detection limits for ellipsoidal variations are quite low because the signal is present throughout the entire light curve rather than being confined to eclipses of a narrower duration . since the period and phase are fixed from the observed eclipses , we model the detection of the ellipsoidal variations as a cross - correlation of the light curve with a cosine function of the appropriate period .",
    "if the fractional uncertainty in flux of each data point is @xmath173 , and the total number of data points is @xmath229 , then the snr of ellipsoidal variations is @xmath230 here , @xmath183 denotes the dilution of the target star in the photometric aperture , which is defined in section [ sec : optimal_aperture ] . due to this factor ,",
    "ellipsoidal variations from bebs are more difficult to detect since their eclipses are usually more diluted than ebs and hebs .",
    "the factor of @xmath110 arises from the rms value of a cosine function .",
    "it seems likely that correlated noise will prevent the detection limit from averaging down to extremely low values as the duration of observations is extended .",
    "somewhat arbitrarily , we require the semi - amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations to exceed 10  ppm , in addition to the criterion snr@xmath231 , to be counted as `` detectable . ''",
    "we also require that the orbital period of the binary , which is twice the period of ellipsoidal variations , is shorter than one spacecraft orbit ( 13.6 days ) out of concern that thermal or other variations of the satellite will induce systematic errors with a similar frequency . under these detection constraints , shown in figure  [ fig : ellipsoidal ] ,",
    "ellipsoidal variations are detected for of the eclipsing binaries in the simulation .",
    "the majority of these are grazing - eclipse binaries rather than hebs or bebs .",
    "the results are summarized in the second column of table [ tbl : fp ] .",
    "another key difference between eclipsing binaries and transiting planets is that the secondary star in a binary is more luminous than a planetary companion .",
    "this distinction is somewhat blurred when comparing brown - dwarf and hot - jupiter companions but is quite clear between ordinary stars and lower - mass planets . if the two stars in a binary have nearly the same surface brightness , then the depths of the primary and secondary eclipses will be indistinguishable . in this case , the system might appear to be a planet with an orbital period equal to half of the true orbital period of the binary .",
    "however , if the surface brightnesses of the stars differ and both eclipses are detected with a sufficiently high snr , then the secondary eclipse can be distinguished from the primary eclipse and the system can be confidently classified as an eclipsing binary .    to estimate the number of cases for which the primary and secondary eclipses are distinguishable , we identify the simulated systems for which signal - to - noise of the secondary eclipses , snr@xmath232 , is @xmath233 , and the snr in the difference between the primary and secondary eclipse depths , snr@xmath234 , is also @xmath233 .",
    "the latter quantity is calculated as @xmath235 where @xmath236 denote the depths of the eclipses and @xmath237 denote the noise in the relative flux over the observed duration of each eclipse .",
    "figure [ fig : dep ] shows the detectability of secondary eclipses by plotting snr@xmath234 versus snr@xmath232 .",
    "the secondary eclipse can be distinguished from the primary eclipse for the systems that lie in the upper - right quadrant of the plot .",
    "the results are also summarized in the third column of table  [ tbl : fp ] .",
    "a majority of the false positives have detectable secondary eclipses that are distinguishable in depth from the primary eclipses .",
    "the notable exceptions include the hebs in which the eclipsing pair consists of equal - mass stars ( @xmath238 ) . in such cases , @xmath239 and",
    "it is impossible to distinguish between primary and secondary eclipses . for the bebs ,",
    "the difficulty is that the eclipse depths are often strongly diluted and the secondary eclipses are not detectable .",
    "most planets are too small and faint to produce detectable secondary eclipses in the bandpass . in the simulations ,",
    "the fraction of detected planets with detectable secondary eclipses is only .",
    "eclipsing binaries can also be distinguished from transiting planets based on the more prolonged ingress and egress phases of stellar eclipses .",
    "as above , we adopt an snr threshold of 5 for the ingress / egress phases to be detectable .",
    "the average `` signal '' during ingress and egress is half the maximum eclipse depth , and the `` noise '' is calculated for the combined durations of ingress and egress . in order to ensure that the ingress / egress can be temporally resolved , we require the duration of the ingress or egress to be more than twice as long as the duration of an individual data sample ( 2  min for the target stars and 30  min for the rest of the stars )",
    ".    since transiting planets generally have ingrees or egress phases lasting a few minutes , will only be able to detect the ingress / egress for a small fraction ( @xmath10810% ) of transiting planets observed with 2  min sampling .",
    "only large planets observed in the 30  min .",
    "ffis would have resolvable ingress / egress .",
    "however , the the ingress / egress phases of eclipsing binaries are more readily detectable .",
    "we note that detection of the ingress / egress alone does not classify a signal as an eclipsing binary .",
    "one would next examine the period and shape of the eclipse signals to determine whether the radius of the eclipsing body is consistent with the observed depth .",
    "figure [ fig : gress ] illustrates the detection of ingress / egress for planets and false positives .",
    "the fourth column of table  [ tbl : fp ] summarizes the results .",
    "approximately 70% of the eclipsing binary systems that detects among the target stars might be classified as false positives by virtue of a lengthy ingress or egress duration .",
    "for stars that are only observed at a 30  min cadence , this method is not as effective .",
    "another diagnostic of false positives , particularly background eclipsing binaries , is the centroid motion that accompanies the photometric variations .",
    "if there are detectable shifts in the centroid of the target star during transit or eclipse events , it is more likely that the target is a blended eclipsing binary rather than a transiting planet or an eclipse of the target star itself .",
    "transits or eclipses of the target star can still have significant centroid motion if another bright star is blended with the target .    with real data",
    ", one could interpret the amplitude and direction of the measured centroid shift using the known locations of neighboring stars in order to determine the most likely source of the photometric variations .",
    "this is a complicated process to simulate , so we simply investigate the issue of the detecting the centroid shift .",
    "as verified in our simulations , the systems with detectable centroid shifts are much more likely to be false positives than transiting planets .",
    "we simulate the detectability of centroid shifts by calculating the two - dimensional centroid ( center - of - light ) of the target star , @xmath240 and @xmath241 , within the @xmath182 synthetic images described in [ sec : image ] .",
    "we calculate the centroids both during and outside of the loss of light to find the magnitude and direction of the centroid shift .",
    "next , we calculate the uncertainty in the centroid @xmath242 and @xmath243 , which stems from the photometric noise of each pixel . if each pixel @xmath244 has coordinates @xmath245 , and its photometric noise relative to the total flux is denoted by @xmath246 , then the noise propagates to the centroid measurement uncertainty through @xmath247 in an analogous fashion to determining the optimal photometric aperture , we select the pixels that maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the centroid measurement . finally , we project the @xmath174 and @xmath175 centroid uncertainties in the direction of the centroid shift .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the centroid measurement is the magnitude of the centroid shift divided by the centroid uncertainty projected in the direction of the centroid shift .",
    "we consider a centroid shift to be detectable if the signal - to - noise is 5 or greater .    in practice",
    ", the centroid measurement uncertainty could be much larger if the spacecraft jitter does not average down during the hour - long timescales of transits and eclipses .",
    "on the other hand , monotonic drifts in the spacecraft pointing during a transit or eclipse are less likely to impact the centroid measurement since the motion is common to all stars .",
    "we find that centroid shifts can be detected for of the bebs and hebs .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ fig : centroid ] and summarized in column 5 of table  [ tbl : fp ] .",
    "the bebs have a higher fraction of detectable centroid shifts from the larger angular separations between the eclipsing system and the target star",

    "approximately of the false positives would fail to be identified .",
    "the large majority ( ) of these more stubborn cases are bebs .",

    "an effective way to identify these bebs is through ground - based imaging with higher angular resolution than the cameras .",
    "a series of images spanning an eclipse could reveal which star ( if any ) is the true source of variations . due to the large pixel scale of the optics , it will not be difficult to improve upon the angular resolution with ground - based observations .",

    ", the `` apparent period '' is the period one would be likely to infer from the photometry ; if the secondary eclipse is detectable but not distinguishable from the primary eclipse , one would conclude that the period is half of the true orbital period .",

    "<S> additional planets larger than 2 @xmath4 can be detected around stars that are not among the pre - selected target stars , because _ tess _ will also deliver full - frame images at a 30  min cadence . </S>",
