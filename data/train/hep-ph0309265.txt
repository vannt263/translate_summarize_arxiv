    "any new physics with a mass scale @xmath1 above the hubble constant during inflation , @xmath2 , will leave an imprint on the cmb although the deviation will be suppressed by @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however , when the universe is not in the euclidean vacuum during inflation , the effects of the short distance physics can be substantially larger , scaling as @xmath4 @xcite , and could be observable if the scale of inflation is sufficiently high .",
    "these deviations occur in tree - level calculations , but loop effects could also be important since they are enhanced compared with their contribution in the euclidean vacuum .",

    "the scalar field used to generate the fluctuations may be modified by strong gravity effects . therefore , without an understanding of field theory at planckian scales , we must impose some matching condition on the low energy theory at this scale .",

    "] however , danielsson @xcite has emphasized that to be physically relevant for the transplanckian problem in inflation , the modes in the @xmath0-vacuum should not be defined to arbitrarily high energies , but only up to a cutoff of the order of the planck scale , @xmath6 .",
    "imposing a cutoff on the theory removes the divergences since the loop momenta , which led to the nonrenormalizable terms , no longer can be arbitrarily large . note that even for a finite cutoff , such terms , although finite , still can not be absorbed by a local counterterm .",
    "even in such a ` truncated @xmath0-vacuum ' , perturbative corrections could be substantially larger for a general @xmath0 than for the euclidean limit  the loop corrections may no longer diverge , but they are still enhanced by powers of the cutoff scale . in calculating the shape of the power spectrum in a truncated @xmath0-vacuum it is therefore important to assess the size of these perturbative corrections since they could be comparable to other non - thermal tree level effects . in particular , we shall show that loop corrections for a theory with a cubic interaction with a coupling of @xmath7 is only suppressed by a factor of @xmath8 relative to the euclidean tree - level result .",

    "the initial suppressing factor from the coupling constant is constrained more or less restrictively depending upon the specific inflationary model studied .    for a single self - interacting inflaton in chaotic inflation ,",
    "slow - roll or observational constraints require a sufficiently small coupling @xmath7 , compared with the hubble scale @xmath2 , that the overall loop effects in these models will be negligible .",
    "however , in a hybrid model the self - coupling is not nearly as constrained so that loop effects could be potentially observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation , or could even be larger than tree - level effects so that such a theory could not be treated perturbatively . moreover , as a result of inverse scaling of the hubble constant in the @xmath10 factor , such loop corrections are actually more significant in low - scale inflationary theories where tree level corrections in a non - thermal background would be negligible .",
    "studying loop corrections to the power spectrum in a non - thermal vacuum provides an additional resource for constraining inflationary models or the vacuum state during inflation , as further precision measurements are made of the cmb . if deviations from the euclidean vacuum expectation are observed , it is important to distinguish their possible origins  whether as non - thermal tree @xcite or loop effects or from the dynamics of other fields near or below the planck scale @xcite  to understand what they are telling us about the very early universe .",
