    "waves play an important role in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere .",
    "they are believed as carriers of photospheric energy into the corona leading to plasma heating .",
    "waves are intensively observed in the solar chromosphere and corona by soho ( solar and heliospheric observatory ) and trace ( transition region and coronal explorer ) ( nakariakov & verwichte 2005 ) .",
    "dominant intensity oscillations in a chromospheric network have a period of @xmath13-min .",
    "the 3-min oscillations are believed to be either standing waves in a chromospheric cavity ( leibacher & stein 1981 ) or propagating waves , which arise as the response of the atmosphere to a general disturbance set at its base ( fleck & schmitz 1991 ) .",
    "coupling of these oscillations to the alfvn waves is a crucial process in both cases , as the alfvn waves may easily pass through the transition region taking the energy into the corona .    on the other hand , recent numerical ( rosenthal et al . , 2002 ) , analytical ( zaqarashvili & roberts , 2006 ) and observational ( muglach et al . , 2005 ) studies point out the importance of @xmath2 region of the solar atmosphere in the wave coupling phenomena .",
    "here we consider the 3-min oscillations as the standing acoustic waves oscillating along an uniform vertical magnetic field and study their weakly nonlinear coupling to alfvn waves near the chromospheric @xmath2 regions .",
    "we use cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 , where spatially inhomogeneous ( along the @xmath4 axis ) magnetic field is directed along the @xmath5 axis , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "unperturbed plasma pressure @xmath7 and density @xmath8 are also assumed to vary along @xmath4 . in the equilibrium ,",
    "magnetic and hydrodynamic pressures satisfy the transverse balance , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "plasma @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the sound and alfvn speeds respectively and @xmath14 is the ratio of specific heats . for simplicity , temperature is suggested to be homogeneous so that the sound speed does not depend on the @xmath4 coordinate .",
    "we consider wave propagation along the @xmath5 axis ( thus along the magnetic field ) and wave polarisation in @xmath15 plane .",
    "then in this case only sound and linearly polarised alfvn waves arise .",
    "the velocity component of sound wave is polarised along the @xmath5 axis and the velocity component of alfvn wave is polarised along the y axis .",
    "then the ideal mhd equations can be written as @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the total ( unperturbed plus perturbed ) hydrodynamic pressure and density , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are velocity perturbations ( of the alfvn and sound waves , respectively ) , @xmath25 is the perturbation in the magnetic field .",
    "note , that the @xmath4 coordinate stands as a parameter in these equations .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) describe the fully nonlinear behavior of sound and linearly polarized alfvn waves propagating along the magnetic field",
    ". however the sound waves may be trapped in a chromospheric cavity between the photosphere and transition region leading to standing patterns .",
    "therefore here we consider the sound waves oscillating along the @xmath5 axis and bounded at @xmath26 and @xmath27 points .",
    "thus there are the standing patterns @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the wavenumber of sound wave such that @xmath30 , so @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the order of corresponding harmonics .",
    "it is natural that almost whole oscillation energy in bounded systems is stored in a fundamental harmonic .",
    "therefore here we consider the first ( @xmath33 ) harmonic of acoustic oscillations , however the same can be applied to harmonics with arbitrary @xmath34 .",
    "recently , zaqarashvili and roberts ( 2006 ) found that the harmonics of acoustic and alfvn waves are coupled when the wave length of acoustic wave is half of alfvn wave one .",
    "therefore let express the alfvn wave components as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the wavenumber of the alfvn waves and the condition @xmath37 is satisfied .",
    "then the substitution of expressions ( 6)-(7 ) into eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) and averaging with @xmath5 over the distance @xmath38 leads to @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42    here eqs .",
    "( 10)-(11 ) describe the time evolution of acoustic oscillation forced by ponderomotive force of alfvn waves , while eqs .",
    "( 8)-(9 ) governs the dynamics of alfvn waves forced by acoustic waves in a parametric way .",
    "it must be noted that the coupling between sound and alfvn waves at @xmath43 has been recently studied by zaqarashvili & roberts ( 2006 ) .",
    "they consider the general case of propagating waves and show an alternate energy exchange between the waves during the propagation . here",
    "we consider the coupling between standing patterns of the waves , which is the particular case of their results .",
    "substitution of @xmath44 from eq .",
    "( 8) into eq .",
    "( 9 ) and neglecting of all third order terms leads to the second order differential equation for alfvn waves    @xmath45 b= 0.\\ ] ]    this equation reflects the parametric influence of standing acoustic wave due to the density variation",
    ". then the particular time dependence of density perturbation determines the type of equation and consequently its solutions .",
    "if we consider the initial amplitude of alfvn waves smaller than the amplitude of acoustic waves , then the term with @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) can be neglected .",
    "physically it means that the back reaction of alfvn waves due to the ponderomotive force is small .",
    "then the solution of eqs .",
    "( 10)-(11 ) is just harmonic function of time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the frequency of the first harmonic of standing acoustic wave and @xmath49 is the relative amplitude .",
    "here we consider the small amplitude acoustic waves @xmath50 , so the nonlinear steepening due to the generation of higher harmonics is negligible .",
    "then the substitution of this expression into eq .",
    "( 12 ) leads to mathieu equation @xmath51",
    "b= 0.\\ ] ]    the solution of this equation with the frequency of @xmath52 has an exponentially growing character , thus the main resonant solution occurs when @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the frequency of alfvn waves . since @xmath55 , the resonance takes place when @xmath56 .",
    "since the alfvn speed @xmath57 is a function of the @xmath4 coordinate , then this relation will be satisfied at particular locations along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "therefore the acoustic oscillations will be resonantly transformed into alfvn waves near this layer .",
    "we call this region _ swing layer _ ( see similar consideration in shergelashvili et al . 2005 ) .    under the resonant condition ( 14 ) the solution of eq .",
    "( 13 ) is @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 .",
    "the solution ( 15 ) has a resonant character within the frequency interval latexmath:[${\\left |{\\omega_a } - { { \\omega_1}/ 2 } \\right |}<{\\left    latexmath:[${\\left |{{v_a}/ c_s } - 1 \\right |}<{\\left |{{\\alpha } } \\right    wave amplitude .",
    "therefore the acoustic oscillations are converted into alfvn waves not only at the surface @xmath56 but in the region where @xmath61 .",
    "thus the resonant layer can be significantly wider for stronger amplitude acoustic oscillations .",
    "note , that the resonant alfvn waves expressed by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 15 ) are standing patterns with the velocity node at the bottom boundary ( @xmath26 ) and antinode at the top boundary ( @xmath27 ) ; the wave length of alfvn waves is twice than that of the acoustic oscillations due to the condition @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the oscillation of magnetic field lines at the upper boundary may excite the waves in an external plasma , which carry energy away .",
    "upper panels show the density and velocity components of standing acoustic oscillations , while lower panels show the magnetic field and velocity component of alfvn waves .",
    "relative amplitude of acoustic oscillations is 0.1 .",
    "alfvn waves with twice the period of acoustic oscillations show rapid exponential increase in time.,width=377 ]    [ figvibstab ]    it must be noted that the alfvn waves may undergo a phase mixing due to the @xmath4 dependence of the alfvn speed ( tsiklauri & nakariakov 2002 ) .",
    "however the aim of this paper is to show the energy conversion from 3-min oscillations into alfvn waves only , therefore we do not consider the effect of phase mixing here .     region . amplitude of alfvn waves ( lower panels ) shows no increase in time , so there is no wave coupling in this region.,width=377 ]    [ figvibstab ]    numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( 8)-(11 ) ( here the back reaction of alfvn waves , i. e. the second term of right hand side in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , is again neglected ) are presented on fig.1 - 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the wave dynamics in @xmath62 region and we see the rapid growth of alfvn waves with twice the period of acoustic oscillations .",
    "however fig.2 shows the wave dynamics away from the resonant layer ( in @xmath63 region ) and we see no energy exchange between the waves . thus there is a good agreement between numerical results and analytical solutions .",
    "it must be mentioned that the equilibrium used in this paper is simplified as gravitational stratification , which is important in the solar chromosphere , is ignored .",
    "the stratification leads to klein - gordon equation for propagating waves with a cut - off for wave frequencies ( roberts , 2004 ) .",
    "the 3-min oscillations and alfvn waves are above the cut - off , so they may propagate in the chromosphere .",
    "unfortunately , the stratification greatly complicates mathematical description of the non - linear coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "plasma @xmath10 can be constant along a vertical magnetic tube even in the case of stratification ( roberts , 2004 ) ; this is the case when sound and alfvn speeds vary with height but their ratio remains constant .",
    "therefore if the waves are coupled at @xmath64 region in an unstratified atmosphere , then the same can be expected in a stratified medium .",
    "however the wave coupling in the stratified atmosphere needs further detailed study , but is not the scope of present paper .",
    "our goal is just to show that the 3-min oscillations may transfer energy into incompressible alfvn waves in @xmath43 region , which was recently observed by muglach et al .",
    "here we show that acoustic oscillations trapped in transversally inhomogeneous medium can be resonantly absorbed by alfvn waves near the layer of @xmath65 .",
    "the spatial width of the layer depends on amplitude of acoustic oscillations and can be significantly wider for strong amplitude oscillations .",
    "we consider the observed 3-min oscillations as the standing fundamental harmonic of acoustic waves trapped in the solar chromospheric cavity with vertical magnetic field and show that their nonlinear coupling to alfvn waves may take place near @xmath43 layer .",
    "the coupling may explain the recent observational evidence of compressible wave absorption near @xmath2 region of solar lower atmosphere ( muglach et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the amplified alfvn waves with the period of @xmath1 6 min may carry energy into the corona .",
    "there they may deposit the energy back to density perturbations leading to observed intensity variations in coronal spectral lines .",
    "thus the layer of @xmath43 may play a role of _ energy channel _ for otherwise trapped acoustic oscillations guiding the photospheric energy into the solar corona .",
    "therefore the process of wave coupling can be of importance for coronal heating problem , but requires further study especially for a stratified atmosphere .",
