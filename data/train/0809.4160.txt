    "we inspect the pixel - ring temperature coupling , and find in released wmap cmb maps that notable temperature distortions exist on scan - rings of hot foreground sources : scan - rings of hot sources are significantly cooled ( presented in  2 ) and strongest anti - correlations between pixel and scan - ring temperatures appear at a separation angle @xmath7 (  3 ) . in ",

    "1000 simulated maps are created and their ring temperatures calculated .",
    "the average ring temperature and its standard deviation is shown in the bottom row of table  1 for each input map . from this table",
    "we can see that , for the four maps the ring temperatures are all notably lower than the expectation with a confidence level higher than @xmath1 . with these results , it is obvious that map temperatures on scan - rings of hot sources suffer systematical distortion , and the observed violence to cmb gaussianity should come , at least partially , from the combined effect of hot foreground sources and wmap s differential nature .",
    "we have also rotated wmap5 ilc temperature map ( by rotating the north pole to other pixels ) to place sample 1 to other locations and compute the new average temperatures . the original sample 1 is known to be abnormal ; therefore it is excluded together with the kp0 foreground mask .",
    "the objective of this test is to check the variances given in table  1 with the original map , and the result should be close to simulation ; otherwise the simulation is suspicious .",
    "the north pole of wmap5 ilc map is rotated to all 3072 sky pixels in healpix resolution @xmath17 and the expectation and rms fluctuation of the average temperature of sample 1 are -0.5 @xmath18k and 4.3 @xmath18k respectively .",
    "this is consistent with table  1 ; therefore , the simulation and table  1 are reliable .",
    ".temperatures ( @xmath18k ) averaged over scan - rings of hot sources [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the magnitude of temperature distortion of the hottest galactic sources upon their scan - rings can be estimated to be @xmath19k from table  1 ( the corresponding region covers about @xmath15 of the entire celestial sphere after removing kp0 mask region ) , and the average distortion for the region of @xmath20 to be @xmath21k from table  4 ( the corresponding region covers @xmath22 of the entire celestial sphere or @xmath23 after removing kp0 mask region ) .",
    "such a wide - spread effect with considerable strength can not be ignored for a precise cosmology study and need to be further investigated .",
    "the detected large scale distortion from cmb gaussianity is closely connected with the galactic hot sources and the wmap beam separation angle , which is hard to explain by the best - fit @xmath0cdm cosmological model and most possibly comes from foreground effect and map - making . to mitigate errors produced by effects from the hot foreground sources , the wmap team used the kp8 mask as a `` processing mask '' during the map - making process@xmath24}$ ] .",
    "however , the detected temperature coupling between hot sources and their scan - rings indicates that the kp8 mask might be not wide enough to exclude all unwanted effect in the map - making process , a broader mask , e.g. kp0 , might be better .",
    "the future cmb observation project planck is designed to measure the cmb anisotropy with completely different mode to wmap , therefore , it is expected to be totally unaffected by such distortion .",
