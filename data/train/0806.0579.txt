    "in many applications of radars and communications systems it is desirable to reconstruct a multiband sparse signal from its samples .",
    "when the carrier frequencies of the signal bands are high compared to the overall signal width , it is not cost effective and often it is not feasible to sample at the nyquist rate .",
    "it is therefore desirable to reconstruct the signal from samples taken at rates lower than the nyquist rate .",
    "there is a vast literature on reconstructing signals from undersampled data @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "most of methods are based on a multicoset sampling scheme .    in a multicoset sampling scheme",
    "@xmath1 low - rate cosets are chosen out of @xmath2 cosets of samples obtained from time uniformly distributed samples taken at a rate @xmath3 where @xmath3 is greater or equal to the nyquist rate @xmath4 @xcite . in each channel",
    "the sampling is offset by a different predetermined integer multiple of the reciprocal of the rate @xmath3 .",
    "the data from the different sampling channels are then used to reconstruct a signal by solving a system of linear equations . under certain conditions on the sampling rate and number of channels , a proper choice of the time offsets",
    "ensures that the equations have a unique solution in case that the signal bands are known a priori @xcite , or unknown a priori @xcite .",
    "a previous work has demonstrated a different scheme for reconstructing sparse multiband signals  @xcite .",
    "the scheme , called multirate sampling ( mrs ) , entails gathering samples at @xmath5 different rates .",
    "the number @xmath5 can be small and does not depend on any characteristics of a signal .",
    "the approach is not intended to obtain the minimum sampling rate .",
    "rather , it is intended to reconstruct signals accurately with a very high probability at an overall sampling rate significantly lower than the nyquist rate under the constraint of a small number of channels .",
    "the reconstruction method in @xcite does not require synchronization of the different sampling channels .",
    "in addition to reducing the complexity of the sampling hardware , unsynchronized sampling relaxes the stringent requirement in multicoset sampling schemes of a very small timing jitter in the sampling time of the channels .",
    "simulations have indicated that mrs reconstruction is robust both to different signal types and to relatively high noise .",
    "accurate signal reconstruction using the unsynchronized mrs scheme of @xcite requires that each frequency in the support of the signal be unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels . in this paper",
    "we describe a new reconstruction algorithm that overcomes this deficiency by using synchronized sampling channels . in our synchronized multirate sampling ( smrs )",
    "scheme , the aliasing is resolved , in the same spirit as multicoset sampling schemes , by solving a system of linear equations .",
    "therefore , the smrs scheme enables the reconstruction of signals that can not be reconstructed using mrs scheme .    in our smrs scheme",
    "each sampling rate must be an integer multiple of the same basic frequency .",
    "the reconstruction method in our smrs scheme requires the same frequency resolution in all sampling channels despite the fact that the sampling rate is different in each channel .",
    "this requirement is well suited to the implementation of the scheme using the optical system described in @xcite .",
    "the sampling is performed in two steps . in the first step",
    "the entire signal spectrum is downconverted into a low frequency region called baseband by multiplying the signal with a train of short optical pulses @xcite . in each of the sampling channels the pulse rate is different .",
    "the frequency downconverted analog signals are then converted in each sampling channel to digital signals using an a / d electronic converter that samples at the highest of the channel rates .",
    "the result is that the signal is sampled in all channels with the same time resolution that is determined by the sampling rate of the a / d converter . alternatively , since each sampling rate must be an integer multiple of the same basic frequency , a common frequency resolution can be obtained by using the same time window for all channels .",
    "there is an inherent advantage to sampling , in each channel , near the maximum sampling rate made possible by cost and technology .",
    "this is because sampling at higher rates increases the signal to noise ratio in sampled signals @xcite .",
    "our simulation results indicate that when the sampling rate in each channel increases , our smrs scheme requires significantly fewer sampling channels than does a multicoset sampling scheme of @xcite to obtain comparable reconstruction success . when the sampling rate in each channel increases , the probability that a sparse signal aliases simultaneously in all sampling channels becomes very low in an mrs scheme . it is lower than in a multicoset sampling scheme in which , because all channels sample at the same frequency , an alias in one channel is equivalent to an alias in all channels .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that the success rate of our smrs scheme is significantly higher than that of a multicoset sampling schemes of @xcite when the number of sampling channels is small ( 3 in our simulations ) and the sampling rate of of each channel is high .",
    "exactly the same data obtained in the smrs scheme can be obtained using a multicoset sampling scheme .",
    "however the multicoset pattern requires many more channels , each of which samples at a very low rate . in a numerical example of section  [ simulations_sect ] a 3 channel multirate sampling pattern is equivalent to a 58 channel multicoset sampling pattern . with this multicoset pattern",
    "the time difference between two consecutive samples is on the order of 1 psec .",
    "such an accuracy can not be practically achieved .    in an smrs scheme",
    "the data is reconstructed differently than in a multicoset scheme implementation of @xcite . in this multicoset recovery scheme",
    "it is assumed that , in addition to being sparse , the spectrum of the signal consists of bands each of which is narrower than the coset sampling rate .",
    "however , our smrs scheme requires no such assumptions on the originating signal .",
    "the reconstruction of sparse signals in our smrs scheme is robust .",
    "this is because most of the sampled spectrum is unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels .",
    "this is in contrast to the equivalent multicoset sampling scheme with many low rate sampling channels in which the alias probability is very high and an alias in one channel is equivalent to an alias in all channels . in such cases a blind signal recovery of @xcite",
    "can be found only by using a pursuit algorithm whereas , in many cases , the smrs scheme does nt require a pursuit algorithm .",
    "the signal is reconstructed directly by a single matrix inversion . by making a very reasonable physical assumption ,",
    "we are also able to simplify the reconstruction by reducing the number of possible signal locations in a straightforward manner .",
    "the smrs scheme reconstructs signals by solving a system of linear equations .",
    "our simulations indicate that linear equations in an smrs scheme are numerically stable in that they have low condition numbers .",
    "this makes them rather insensitive to noise . in the smrs scheme ,",
    "when sampling at total sampling rate that is significantly higher than theoretically required , the probability that part of the signal spectrum will not be aliased in at least one of the sampling channels is very high .",
    "the unaliased parts of the signal can be recovered directly from the sampling channels .",
    "our simulation results indicate that the sensitivity of the reconstructed signal to noise added at frequencies of baseband that are not aliased in at least one of sampling channels is very low .",
    "in this section we describe the smrs scheme .",

    "this interval is called the @xmath23th baseband . to process the sampled signals it is necessary to discretize the frequency axis .",
    "we use the same frequency resolution ( @xmath28 ) in all of the sampling channels .",
    "the same frequency resolution is directly obtained if the system is implemented using an optical sampling system @xcite . to use our reconstruction method each sampling rate",
    "should be chosen to be an integer multiple @xmath29 of the basic frequency resolution : @xmath30 . by using a sampling time window with a duration @xmath31 , the same frequency resolution @xmath28 is obtained in all of the sampling channels .",
    "alternatively , the same frequency resolution can be obtained in an optical system by using a / d converters with the same rate at the output of all the optical downconvertors @xcite . to reduce computational requirements we ignore redundant data .",
    "thus , only @xmath29 entries of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) are retained for further processing .",

    "the equations for reconstructing such a signal are described in the appendix .",

    "our objective is to invert ( [ mat_eq2 ] ) in the case of sparse signals with sampling rates @xmath60 .",

    "the number of rows must equal or exceed the number of columns .",
    "although the entire spectrum is downconverted to baseband , we assume that we are sampling highly sparse signals .",
    "hence the number of non - zero entries in each @xmath39 is significantly smaller than @xmath29 in at least one of the sampling channels .",
    "the number of non - zero entries in each @xmath39 might even be smaller because of aliasing . a necessary condition for a unique inverse or pseudo - inverse of @xmath63",

    "this is consistent with a landau theorem @xcite that states that one can not reconstruct a signal if the spectral density of the samples collected from all sampling channels is less than the spectral support of the originating signal .",
    "the choice of sampling rates imposes restrictions on the possible values of @xmath64 for which an inversion of ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) is possible . for the matrix @xmath63 to have full column rank",

    "the matrix @xmath50 is composed of @xmath5 sub - matrices @xmath42 whose columns are periodic : @xmath65 for the matrix @xmath50 not to be periodic , it is required that any common period of the @xmath5 sub - matrices be larger than @xmath57 .",

    "we assume that , for each discretized frequency @xmath69 , any sampled spectrum @xmath70 is due only to lack of a signal in any of its replicas and not due to any aliasing . in other words if , for any @xmath71 , @xmath72 , then @xmath73 .",
    "another assumption is that there is a unique solution in the case the signal support is known , i.e. , the matrix @xmath63 has a full column rank for a known support .    applying the first assumption , one can detect baseband frequencies in which there is no signal .",
    "these frequencies can be eliminated in the reduction of ( [ mat_eq2 ] ) .",
    "we describe this simple procedure for eliminating frequencies which , according to our assumption , can not be part of the spectral support of the originating signal .",

    "however any solution found can be used to construct an infinite number of solutions to the equation .",
    "thus , there is no unique inversse to ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) and the inversion problem is ill - posed .    to reconstruct a signal in the case",
    "in which the inversion problem is ill - posed we impose an additional assumption on the signal .",
    "we assume that in the case the signal support is unknown and the problem is ill - posed , among all possible solutions to ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) , the originating signal is the one that is composed of the minimum number of bands .",
    "this is the signal we attempt to construct .",
    "we also assumed earlier that the reduced matrix which corresponds to the case in which the signal support is known is well - posed . in case that this assumption is not fulfilled the sampled signal does not contain enough information for solving the problem . under the three assumptions stated above ( the assumption that leads to matrix reduction , the existence of the unique solution to ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) when the signal bands are known , and band - sparsity ) the inversion problem is reduced to finding the solution of ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) that is composed of the minimum number of bands .",
    "the problem is np - complex since we need to test every possible combination of bands .",
    "the algorithm described here is of lower complexity and its purpose is to find a solution of ( [ mat_eq4 ] ) that is composed of the minimum number of bands without testing all the combinations .",
    "the resulting algorithm attains a lower success rate but decreases the run - time significantly as compared to an np - complex algorithm .",
    "we do not provide the conditions under which the correct solution is obtained .",
    "our algorithm is based on the @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "this algorithm belongs to the category of the `` greedy search '' algorithms .",
    "the original omp algorithm is used to find the sparsest solution @xmath40 of underdetermined equations @xmath82 @xcite where @xmath56 is an underdetermined matrix .",
    "the sparsest solution is the solution having the smallest norm @xmath83 where @xmath83 is the number of non zero elements in the vector @xmath40 .",

    "is it possible to determine the support of the signal .",
    "the algorithm failed primarily for one of two reasons .",
    "one of them was due to the inclusion of a block that reduced the residual error on one hand but on the other hand , caused a resulting matrix @xmath86 to be not full column rank as hypothesized in our problem ( in section [ unknown_bands_locations ] ) .",
    "this can happen , for example , when a block consists of a correct sub - block and erroneous sub - blocks . including any erroneous sub - blocks may result in an ill - posed problem .",
    "another reason for failure was a large dynamic range of the signals .",
    "when reconstructing such signals , correct bands may be ignored by the algorithm in cases that the energy within the bands is significantly lower than the energy in other bands .",
    "sufficient conditions that assure that the algorithm converges to a unique solution have not yet been determined .",
    "the ability of the signal reconstruction algorithm to recover different types of signals was tested . in one set of simulations the ability of the algorithm to reconstruct multiband complex and",

    "additional simulations were performed in which real - valued multiband signals were contaminated by additive white noise .",

    "for each set of simulations we counted the mean rate of ill - posed cases in which the modified omp algorithm was used to recover the signal .",
    "mean times for accurate signal reconstruction were also recorded .",
    "failures of the reconstruction were either because one of the initial assumptions was not fulfilled or because of the failure of the modified omp algorithm .    in different simulations",
    "the width of each band ( hence the total bandwidth of the signal ) was varied .",
    "the number of bands was always set equal to 4 for complex signals and to 8 for real - valued signals ( 4 positive bands and 4 negative bands ) .",
    "however , the reconstruction algorithm was unaware of this number .",

    "the simulations were performed on a 2 ghz core2duo cpu with 2 gb ram storage in the matlab 7.0 environment ( no special programming was performed to use both cores ) .      in the case of ideal multiband signals , because of the absence of energy outside of strictly defined bands , one can expect a perfect reconstruction .",
    "accordingly , the algorithm was evaluated by a perfect reconstruction criterion ; i.e. , a mean difference between the true and the reconstructed signal spectrum less than @xmath109 .",

    "in this paper we describe a synchronized multirate sampling scheme for accurately reconstructing sparse multiband signals using a small number of sampling channels ( 3 in our simulations ) whose total sampling rate is significantly lower than the nyquist rate .",
    "although the same data that is obtained from our scheme can be obtained by a multicoset scheme , such a multicoset scheme requires many more channels and a time accuracy that can not be attained practically .",
    "moreover , our scheme processes the data differently , in a way that results in significantly wider basebands and thus greatly reduces the effects of aliasing . by synchronizing the sampling channels our scheme is able to reconstruct signals correctly even in most cases in which the signal is aliased in all the sampling channels .",
    "the main advantage of multicoset sampling schemes is theoretical . because in a multicoset sampling scheme each channel samples at the same frequency , one has a mathematical structure that enables a perfect reconstructions of ideal multiband signals from samples taken at a total sampling rate that is close to a theoretical lower bound .",
    "this bound is attained only under special assumptions regarding the number and width of the signal bands .",
    "moreover , the bound requires the number of sampling channels to be twice the number of signal bands @xcite .",
    "hence , in many cases the number of sampling channels becomes too high for a practical implementation .",
    "the main advantage of the smrs is in the use of a small number of sampling channels that operate at relatively high rates that can reconstruct accurately sparse signal that consist of several bands .",
    "sampling at higher rates has a fundamental advantage in that it increases the snr after sampling .",
    "another advantage is that implementation of the smrs scheme does not require a priori knowledge of the maximum width of the signal bands .",
    "a third advantage of our scheme is that , in many cases the signal can be reconstructed by simple matrix inversion rather than through a search algorithm as in the multicoset recovery scheme of @xcite .    in the smrs scheme , when sampling sparse signals , most of the sampled spectrum is unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels .",
    "hence , most of the spectrum can be reconstructed directly from the unaliased parts of the spectrum . on the other hand , in multicoset sampling schemes",
    "an alias in one channel is equivalent to an alias in all channels .",
    "furthermore , a multicoset scheme downconverts signals to much lower frequencies , thus increasing the negative effects of aliasing .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that the reduced aliasing in our smrs scheme results in significantly better performance over a multicoset sampling scheme of @xcite whose number of sampling channels is small .",
    "also , due to reduced aliasing , it is expected that the reconstruction in the smrs scheme will be robust when noise is added in the sampling process .    although we do not have a rigorous criteria for perfect reconstruction , by examining the multicoset pattern that yields the same data it might be possible to obtain necessary conditions for a perfect reconstruction .",
    "our scheme also solves ill - conditioned linear equations by using a modified omp algorithm . whereas we obtained satisfactory results with it",
    ", we do not have criteria for determining when the modified omp algorithm converges to the correct solution .",
    "however , this shortcoming may be not as significant because of the possibility of using other algorithms to solve the equations .",
    "in this appendix we present the modifications to ( [ mat_eq2 ] ) for the real signals recovery .",
    "since the signal is real - valued , its spectrum fulfills @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the complex conjugate and @xmath174 and @xmath175 are real numbers .",
    "it follows from ( [ conjugate ] ) and ( [ sampled spectrum ] ) , that for each channel index @xmath23 , all the information about @xmath22 is contained in the interval @xmath160 $ ] .",
