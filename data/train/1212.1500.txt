    "in 1867 lord kelvin suggested  @xcite that elementary particles can be knots .",
    "while his idea of knotted fluid vortices in the aether as fundamental objects of nature was revolutionary for his time , our present experimental knowledge does not agree with this conjecture .",
    "specifically , we now know that knotted fluid vortices are unstable and worse still , the aether does not exist . nevertheless , the idea is attractive for its simplicity of relating fundamental physical and mathematical objects , and it should not be discarded out of hand before being tested on various other physical systems .",
    "one such system where stable knotted configurations may exist is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the subject of the present study .",
    "observations from many experiments can be interpreted as signatures of unusual mesonic states , i.e. , bosonic hadrons that are not pure @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "such states can be broadly divided into the following types : ( 1 )  hybrids  bound states of quarks and gluons , like @xmath4 with quantum numbers @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; ( 2 )  exotics  for example , four and six quark states , such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 with quantum numbers @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath14 ; ( 3 )  glueballs  states with no valence quarks at all , composed of pointlike or collective glue , e.g. , string loops  la nielsen - olesen  @xcite , or closed flux tubes .",
    "( even though glueballs do not contain valence quarks , there are certainly sea ( virtual ) quarks within a glueball . )",
    "glueballs are among the most studied and least understood classes of particles in qcd  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations , qcd sum rules , electric flux tube models , and constituent glue models lead to a consensus that the lightest valence quark - free state is a glueball with quantum numbers @xmath15  @xcite . on the lattice ,",
    "usually only a single glueball state below @xmath162 gev is considered , since all the excitations are expected to be above this energy  @xcite , however , a full study of topological operators responsible for knots and links on the lattice is computationally challenging at present and has not yet been carried out . nevertheless ,",
    "studying such configurations would be interesting and potentially important for a better understanding of qcd  @xcite .    although glueballs , and the @xmath17 states they are associated with , are one of the most widely discussed problems in hadronic physics , and , while many glueball models have been proposed  @xcite , there is still no consensus of what constitutes a glueball beyond its @xmath0 quantum numbers . here",
    "we take an egalitarian approach .",
    "specifically , we model all @xmath0 mesonic states , i.e. , all @xmath18 and @xmath19 states listed by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite ( @xmath17 states , for brevity ) , as knotted or linked chromoelectric qcd flux tubes  @xcite .",
    "hence we will use the term `` glueball '' loosely as a shorthand for any @xmath0 state in qcd .",
    "in  @xcite two of us argued how to generalize various classical ideas from plasma physics to a semiclassical model of knotted and linked configurations in qcd . to this end",
    ", we first recall that maxwell s equations for an ideal plasma imply that flux lines are locked into the plasma flow .",
    "this means that if the flux lines are knotted or linked , then the flux line topology is conserved as the flow evolves .",
    "a classical consequence of conservation of topology is the concept of helicity and its conservation in a plasma  @xcite .",
    "helicity in this context corresponds to the degree of gaussian linking of qcd flux tubes . keeping only the helicity fixed , while allowing other topological changes in flux lines , and minimizing the energy leads to the so - called taylor states @xcite in plasma physics .",
    "keeping flux tube topology fixed leads to tight knots @xcite in qcd .",
    "the simplest configuration of linked flux tubes has the form of a hopf link ( denoted @xmath20 ) in which two unknots are linked together in the simplest way such that the gaussian linking number is one .",
    "this is the tight hopf link , in which fixed diameter @xmath21 flux tubes , carrying one flux quantum each , have the shortest total length .",
    "the ratio of the total length of the tubes to their diameter @xmath21 is invariant for all such tight hopf links .",
    "we define the `` knot energy '' of the tight configuration @xmath22 as its dimensionless length @xmath23 , @xmath24 where in this example @xmath25 , so then @xmath26 . by `` knot",
    "energy , '' mathematicians generally mean some kind of repulsive electrostatic energy such as ohara s energy @xcite or the freedman - he - wang @xcite `` mobius energy . ''",
    "our @xmath27 is called the ropelength of the configuration and the configurations which minimize the ropelength are called `` tight '' or `` ideal '' knots @xcite ; see also @xcite . for the hopf link and a family of other simple links , where the tight configuration is known ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "as expected , for the hopf link this configuration consists of two linked circles passing through each other s centers .",
    "the hopf link is the simplest link , but there is an infinite family of topologically different link types .",
    "many of these configurations have been tabulated by mathematicians @xcite and there are different topological invariants ( such as linking numbers ) which distinguish them .",
    "however , regardless of which invariants are used to identify the configurations , the `` frozen - in field '' hypothesis implies that tube topology is conserved .",
    "hence , we conjecture that the ground states of all systems of flux tubes , with any type of nontrivial linking , are the states with the shortest length tubes .",
    "similar to linked flux tubes , we also consider self - linked ( knotted ) flux tubes , where the associated tight knot states and dimensionless knot lengths are analogously defined .",
    "the simplest example of a nontrivially knotted flux tube has the form of the trefoil knot @xmath28 .",
    "this configuration has knot energy which has been numerically calculated to be @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that there are no known analytic forms for the lengths of any tight knots or links with nonplanar elements .    to begin the description of the model",
    ", we consider a high energy hadron - hadron collision in the process of rehadronization , where there are baryons , mesons and quantized fluxes confined to tubes .",
    "if the tubes are open , with quarks and anti - quarks at their ends , then they are excited baryon or meson states .",
    "our interest is in closed tubes which can be self - linked ( knotted ) or linked with each other . as a key part of our model",
    ", we identify all the @xmath17 states as knotted or linked qcd chromoelectric flux tubes . the topological quantum numbers ( or knot / link type of the configuration )",
    "are what stabilizes the knotted and linked configurations , so we assume that non - topological ( i.e. , unknotted / unlinked ) @xmath0 closed flux tube configurations are too unstable to have measurable widths . a configuration with tightly knotted or linked flux tubes in the form of the knot or link @xmath22 will be called @xmath30 .",
    "note that topological invariants in qcd typically require instanton and chern - simons terms for their full description @xcite , but we will not need these subtleties here .    as argued above , nontrivial knotting and linking leads to quasi - stable generalized minimum energy states .",
    "this implies the following theorem .    for a configuration with a topological charge measured by knotting or linking of flux tubes of a constant radius ( due to quantized flux , and therefore of constant energy or mass per unit length ) ,",
    "the generalized minimum energy state is the one that minimizes @xmath31 and therefore ties the knot or link with the shortest tube .",
    "[ theorem ]    clearly , the minimum energy corresponds to the minimum dimensionless length of tube needed to support the topology .",
    "since the length and energy coincide up to a rescaling , the proof proceeds trivially by inspection .",
    "( note that this proves a quantum analog of moffatt s 1985 conjecture that higher order linking leads to positive lower bounds on configuration energy . )",
    "we will see below that the approximation of a fixed energy per unit length can be improved by an analysis of the effect of field rearrangement within a bent tube .",
    "we conclude that the quantum case of tight flux tube configurations is much simpler than the corresponding classical case where one minimizes energy with a flux constraint .",
    "however , the quantum case suggests that it may be possible to sum or integrate any large number of flux quanta to get the classical result for the generalized minimum energy of a gaussian - linked or higher order topological configuration .",
    "( such a result would complete the proof of moffatt s conjecture for the classical case . )",
    "this is a side issue from our main purpose here that will be explored elsewhere .",
    "let us now proceed with the further description of our phenomenological model , which is similar to the model in @xcite , but with some minor modifications .",
    "pulling a quark - antiquark ( @xmath32 ) pair apart in the qcd vacuum , a chromoelectric flux tube forms along a path connecting the quark and antiquark . if the @xmath33 is annihilated against the @xmath34 , or if it is annihilated by a @xmath34 in another @xmath32 pair , where the new @xmath33 is in turn annihilated , etc .",
    ", to close the path , then a closed flux tube containing one flux quantum can form as an unknot or a knot . a flux tube following such a curved path could also , for instance , be due to multiple scattering of the inital @xmath32 pair before its mutual annihilation .",
    "if the closed tube is a knot , or if it ends up being linked with another closed tube , then such an object has at least one nonzero topological quantum number , and this quantity is what tends to stabilize the tight configuration , which we either identify with one of the observed @xmath17 states or use to predict a new state . to allow hadronization to run its course , we assume that the typical time scale needed to reach a tight configuration is shorter than the typical lifetime of the hadron .    since the publication of @xcite in 2003 , there has been slow continuous physics progress in the refinement of the @xmath17 states data as summarized by the pdg  @xcite , with smaller error bars from better statistics and a few new states now listed in their summary tables .",
    "the change in the @xmath17 state data that affects our model the most is the pdg s realignment of the mass of the @xmath35 , formerly called the @xmath36 and now reassigned as the @xmath37 .",
    "while there has been no new data since 2007 , there has been several new reanalyses of compilations of the existing data .",
    "the 2010 pdg value of the @xmath36 mass was reported to be in the range @xmath38 mev and we previously used @xmath39 mev as our approximation .",
    "now the pdg is reporting a mass range for the @xmath37 of @xmath40 mev .",
    "this is a drastic change since the range has contracted by a factor of 5 and the central value has dropped by over 300 mev .",
    "contrary to the rather gradual physics progress , the mathematical knowledge of tight knots has changed dramatically from what was used in @xcite to what it is today  @xcite . in 2003 the lengths of only a handful of tight knots and non - planar links were known , and some of those only to an accuracy between 5% and 10% .",
    "now we know the complete length spectrum of the first several hundred tight prime knots and non - planar links with an accuracy that is assumed to be in the @xmath41 range for most of this spectrum .",
    "the lengths of the composite knots have recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "we present new computations covering the final piece of the puzzle  ropelengths of composite _ links_for the first time below .",
    "the current limitation on knot energies needed for the model is due to the fact that we are dealing with physical knots and links that can be constricted or distorted ( see below ) , thus increasing the errors on the effective lengths .",
    "even with this caveat , we still can advantageously refit the @xmath0 data by comparing it with high accuracy tight knot and link data after adding estimated errors , all of which is collected in tables [ table - lengths1 ] through [ table - cclengths2 ] below .",
    "let us summarize the model assumptions :    1 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath17 states and tightly knotted and linked chromoelectric flux tubes .",
    "the flux is quantized with one flux quantum per tube .",
    "3 .   knotted and linked flux tubes are stabilized by topological quantum numbers .",
    "the tube diameter is in the @xmath42 fm range .",
    "( this corresponds to a string tension of approximately @xmath43 mev , which agrees with lattice estimates . )",
    "the quantity @xmath44 in an @xmath45 or @xmath19 state is the intrinsic angular momentum of the associated knotted solitonic solution of the qcd field equations .",
    "the relaxation to a tight state configuration ( via processes where no topology change is involved ) is faster than its decay rate ( via processes with topology change ) for an @xmath17 state , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "one modification from @xcite is that we now assume @xmath44 is the intrinsic angular momentum rather than the rotational angular momentum .",
    "we do this because the tube diameter is now assumed to be smaller and hence the rotational energy level spacing to be larger , @xmath47 mev , as opposed to a few mev for the thicker tubes assumed in @xcite .",
    "the other significant modification is that we correct the energy due to tube curvature as discussed in the next section and include estimated errors due to other physical corrections .",
    "fit using uncorrected knot / link lengths : fit of the @xmath45 states data to tight knot and link lengths ( ropelengths ) .",
    "errors are shown for the states , but they are too small to be visible for the lengths of ideal knots and links , however we include a 3% error in the knot energies due to the fact that we are dealing with physical knots and links .",
    "( see discussion in the text . ) non - fitted knots and links are not shown . ]",
    "we begin by identifying ideal knot and link lengths with glueballs and/or predicted glueballs , where we include all @xmath17 states .",
    "the lightest candidate is the @xmath37 , which we identify with the shortest knot or link , i.e. , the hopf link @xmath48 ; the @xmath49 is identified with the next shortest knot or link , in this case the trefoil knot @xmath28 , etc .",
    "our initial one - parameter fit of the data is shown in figure [ 1p - fit ] .",
    "the slope is @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 .",
    "the fit is poor mainly because of the constraint imposed by the very small error bars on the masses of the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 .",
    "we will now see how to improve the fit when ideal tubes are replaced with physical tubes .",
    "note we are already assuming errors of 3% on the knot lengths which anticipates this replacement .",
    "in the discussion so far we have assumed uniform flux across the cross section of the tubes , but flux is not necessarily uniform over the cross section of curved tubes .",
    "this leads us to define a new energy functional for tubes which we call the `` flux tube energy . ''    to motivate our definition , we consider the effect of bending on the total energy of a field confined to a tube . first recall that the magnetic field of an ideal toroidal solenoid with fixed flux falls like @xmath54 from the symmetry axis . to see this ,",
    "choose cylindrical coordinates @xmath55 as shown in fig .",
    "[ coordinates ] and note that symmetry requires the field be in the @xmath56 direction .",
    "( for an elementary argument see @xcite . ) here we will proceed via a variational argument which is a simpler alternative .",
    "we hold the flux @xmath57 fixed and vary the field to find the functional form of the energy @xmath58 for a toroidal solenoid . the general form of the energy is @xmath59 the @xmath60 integration runs over the cross section of the tube @xmath61 . since @xmath62 is independent of @xmath56 , the @xmath56 integration gives @xmath63 the flux through @xmath61 is @xmath64 now we want to vary @xmath58 with respect to @xmath62 while holding @xmath57 fixed .",
    "this is equivalent to considering @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "for unit vector @xmath67 normal to the cross section , the variation of @xmath62 gives @xmath68 which vanishes for arbitrary @xmath69 only if @xmath70 we find @xmath66 from the requirement @xmath71 , which gives @xmath72 with @xmath73     cross section of a toroidal flux tube of minor radius @xmath74 and major radius @xmath75 .",

    "( in numerical studies of tight knots and links , it is observed that the integral in ( [ tubeenergy ] ) is typically @xmath90 which translates into an @xmath167% correction of the energy from the ropelength value . )",
    "it would be an interesting project to numerically minimize the flux tube energy for various knot and link types .",
    "however , this is likely to be a somewhat challenging project : minimizing functionals of curvature ( a second derivative of position ) constrained by tube contact ( a function of position ) is quite difficult .",
    "still , there has been recent progress in the numerical modeling of elastic rods with self - contact @xcite which lead to us hope that these computations may be tractable in the near future .    in the meantime , we have chosen to minimize the original @xmath27 energy numerically using ` ridgerunner ` @xcite , and then compute the @xmath31 energy for the @xmath27-minimizing configurations on the grounds that the difference between @xmath31-minimizing and @xmath27-minimizing configurations are likely to be small . in figure [ smallhistogram ]",
    "we have histogrammed the shortest 72 knots and links after curvature corrections have been applied . in figure [ largehistogram ]",
    "we have histogrammed the currently available complete set of 945 curvature corrected knots and links .",
    "we should remark that in some cases the curvature is discontinuous , but the field is not .",
    "for example , the inner loop of the chain of three elements ( the @xmath91 ) is shaped like a race track  two straight sections connected by two half circles . in a solenoid of this form",
    "the curvature is discontinuous at the junctions , but if we move along the field lines we find that the fields are already changing before they reach the junctions since the windings are different in the regions beyond the junction and the field is affected by the fringe fields in that region .",
    "hence the fields can be continuous through the junction .",

    "histogram of the magnitudes of the curvature corrections to all @xmath92 currently tabulated knot and link lengths . ]    as an example of a case with both length and curvature correction that can be calculated exactly @xcite , consider the chain of three unknots @xmath93 which has length @xmath94 and has @xmath95 in curved regions and @xmath96 in straight sections .",
    "we find an overall corrected value @xmath97    note that all exactly calculable link lengths in our tables are unique , but degeneracies can occur at longer lengths .",
    "the first such examples are the links corresponding to the @xmath98 and @xmath99 dynkin diagrams .",
    "both have the length @xmath100 ( which falls slightly beyond the largest lengths included in our tables ) and both have the same curvature corrected energy @xmath101 .",
    "other corrections should lift this degeneracy .",
    "in our model , the chromoelectric fields  @xcite @xmath102 are confined to the knotted and linked tubes , each carrying one quantum of conserved flux  @xcite .",

    ", there are questions about comparing with the mass values for other @xmath17 states found in invariant mass plots .",
    "there is also the important issue of mixing with four quark and other resonances .",
    "however , we are not in a position to comment further on these matters with confidence except for the general qualitative remark that in a flux tube model we could expect mixing with excited mesons if there is resonant behavior of tube breaking ( forming a @xmath3 pair ) and rejoining ( by annihilating the pair ) . resonant breaking and rejoining a two positions , or in two link tubes mixes with four quark states , etc .",

    "we call the case discussed above the high - fit , where we identify the @xmath117 with the @xmath118 knot , and the low - fit where we identify the @xmath117 with the @xmath119 link .",
    "the high - fit is the one that predicts a new state at @xmath144 mev , while the low - fit gives a one - to - one match between the first 12 @xmath17-states and the first 12 knots and links .",
    "the low - fit gives a somewhat better @xmath127 , but the high - fit gives an acceptable @xmath127 and could be required if for instance the 1220 mev state of @xcite is confirmed making it necessary to free up a low energy knot / link to identify with it .",
    "since we have already presented the high - fit above , we now proceed to discuss the low - fit .",
    "the low - fit leaves no gaps in the spectrum until we get near 1700 mev .",
    "the @xmath127 is improved and the fitted value of @xmath128 is similar to the high - fit case .",
    "we find @xmath145 the low - fit is our best overall fit to the data .",
    "we have tabulated the fitted energies for the first 72 knots and links , identifying all @xmath17-states of energy less than 2 gev , hence giving predictions of many new states at 1690 mev and above .",
    "now let us discuss the statistical significance of our results .",
    "first we have done a number of tests to determine if our hypothesis that glueballs are knotted flux tubes is likely to be correct .",
    "let us begin with the well - known kolmogorov - smirnov test , which tests distribution functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 by means of the quantity @xmath148 which in this case are the distribution functions of the glueball masses and calculated knot and link lengths .",
    "the resulting @xmath149-value for the kolmogorov - smirnov test is @xmath150 where we recall that @xmath149 is bounded @xmath151 and @xmath152 implies poor correlation , @xmath153 implies moderate correlation and @xmath154 implies strong correlation .",
    "hence the kolmogorov - smirnov test implies our model is in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test is a measure of goodness - of - fit .",
    "we summarize this and a number of other goodness - of - fit tests as well as several variance tests in table [ table - p - values ] .",
    "all show excellent agreement between model and data . here and below we give @xmath149-values for the high - fit case .",
    "the low - fit values are similar .",
    "another approach is to calculate the @xmath127 for the data set , subject to the corrections of energy per unit length differences and deformations from the ideal knot case .",
    "we have argued that the minimum energy and minimum length of knots do not necessarily coincide .",
    "while we expect the average energy per unit length of a knot does not strongly depend on knot type , there is still a small correction due to this effect .",
    "in addition , the tubes can be constricted due to being wrapped by another section of the tube or distorted by wrapping tightly around another section of tube ( as a rope wrapped tightly around a post ) .",
    "we can approximate such corrections and will consider a typical example below .",
    "we have calculated the change in energy of a pair of linked flux tubes to provide an example of corrections we should expect due to constriction , which in turn gives a contribution to the expected error in using physical tubes instead of ideal mathematical tubes to model glueballs .",
    "the example we consider is a cylindrical tube along the @xmath155-axis encircled by a toroidal tube lying in the @xmath156-plane at @xmath157 .",
    "we assume both tubes have circular cross section with that of the torus staying fixed , but that of the cylinder being of reduced radius in the region of constriction , @xmath158 where @xmath159^{1/2 } ;    \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see fig  [ deformation ] . we further assume both tubes carry the same amount of flux and so set their undistorted radii equal , @xmath160 .",
    "the torus would tighten until @xmath161 , except that it begins to encounter the cylindrical tube at @xmath95 .",
    "the torus energy @xmath162 where the function @xmath58 is defined in , falls as it tightens and the energy in the cylindrical tube @xmath163    \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] grows as it is constricted .",
    "stability is reached by minimizing @xmath164 with respect to @xmath165 ; see fig .",
    "[ deformation ] .     cross section of a toroidal flux tube of minor radius @xmath74 and major radius @xmath75 constricting a cylindrical flux tube of radius @xmath166 . ]    we have estimated the constriction for the hopf link of two magnetic flux tubes and find a @xmath167 correction over the region of constriction , which translates into an overall @xmath168 correction to the link energy , since about @xmath169 of the hopf link is constricted .",
    "we expect distortion effects to be similar .",
    "however , since all knots and links have similar corrections that modify their total energies in the same direction , we expect the spread in variation to be smaller than the correction itself .",
    "hence a @xmath170 error on physical knot energies versus tight knot energies is not unreasonable .",
    "an actual qcd flux tube could be more rigid due to confinement effects , so we can justify reducing the error bars to something smaller . even assuming qcd flux tubes are substantially more rigid than magnetic flux tubes , we still find an acceptable value for @xmath127 .",
    "for example , letting @xmath171 we find the model is in reasonable agreement with the data as seen in the figures for the fits .    in terms of the bag model  @xcite",
    ", the interiors of flux tubes of tight knots correspond to the interiors of bags .",
    "the flux in the tube is supported by current sheets on the bag boundary ( surface of the tube ) .",
    "knot complexity can be reduced ( or increased ) by unknotting ( knotting ) operations  @xcite . in terms of flux tubes ,",
    "these moves are equivalent to reconnection events  @xcite .",
    "hence , a metastable glueball may decay via reconnection .",
    "once all topological charge is lost , metastability is lost , and the decay proceeds to completion .",
    "two other glueball decay processes are : flux tube or string breaking @xcite ( this favors large decay widths for configurations with long flux tube components ) and quantum fluctuations that unlink flux tubes ( this would tend to broaden states with short flux tube components ) . since the publication of  @xcite ,",
    "some minor quantitative progress has been made in understanding knot flux tube decay , but these results are still insufficient to go beyond the qualitative observations made in  @xcite .",
    "let us make one final comment about the model .",
    "a more conservative approach is to assume only the @xmath172 states , i.e. , the @xmath173 states , correspond to knotted / linked flux tubes . in that case",
    "there are only five states to fit and the result is displayed in figure [ f0-fit ] for comparison , where the identified states are @xmath174\\longleftrightarrow [ 2 ^ 2_1,3_1,5_1,5_2,6_2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the slope is essentially unchanged , the @xmath124 value is roughly the same .",
    "the masses of the predicted states can be easily gotten by rescaling the knot lengths in the table with the new slope parameter @xmath175 .",
    "note that the @xmath117 has been moved in the ordering to improve the fit .",
    "more data is needed to distinguish between the fit of all @xmath45 states and the restricted @xmath173 fit .",
    "the @xmath176 for the fit is not particularly good but it only takes replacing the new @xmath37 values with the old @xmath37 mass and error bars to get @xmath177 .",
    "so if the new @xmath37 mass is due to mixing and one could extract the unmixed value for the pure gluonic state it is possible that the fit would improve again .",
    "if a sufficient number of @xmath45 states are found , so that they outnumber the total number of knots and links , then this would be evidence to support the restricted fit ( since all short knots and links are presumed to be known ) . however , this is not the case at present .",
    "the @xmath173 states data is fitted to the curvature corrected knot and link data .",
    "errors are shown for the states and estimated to be 3% for the knot / link energy .",
    "non - fitted knots and links are not shown . ]",
    "the @xmath173 states data is fitted to the curvature corrected knot and link data and predicted states ( open disks ) . ]",
    "we have considered hadronic collisions that produce some number of baryons and mesons plus a gluonic state in the form of a closed qcd flux tube ( or a set of tubes ) . from an initial state",
    ", the fields in the flux tubes quickly relax to an equilibrium configuration , which is topologically equivalent to the initial state .",
    "( we assume topological quantum numbers are conserved during this rapid process . )",
    "the tube radius is set by the confinement scale , so to lowest order the energy of the final state depends only on the topology of the initial state and equals the length @xmath23 of the tube times the average energy per unit length , or the dimensionless knot or link length @xmath27 times the energy scale parameter @xmath128 . while related to @xmath178 by constants of order unity , @xmath128 can be more accurately determined ( see above ) and hence could be a useful dimensionful parameter in studying other properties of qcd , such as scattering and hadronization processes .",
    "the relaxation proceeds through minimization of the field energy .",
    "this process occurs via shrinking the tube length and the process halts to form a tight knot or link .",
    "flux conservation and energy minimization also force the fields to be homogeneous across the tube cross sections for straight tube sections and the fields fall like @xmath54 for curved sections as shown above .",
    "we have estimated corrections to the simple energy - length proportionality and have used them to correct and place error bars on the physical knot lengths .",
    "details of knot excitations would be interesting to investigate , as would other quantum corrections , but at present we do not have a reliable way to estimate these effects , nor do we have a good way to calculate glueball decay rates .",
    "however , we do expect high mass glueball production to be suppressed because more complicated non - trivial topological field configurations are statistically disfavored and we also expect higher mass glueballs to be relatively less stable .    on the lattice the glueball is associated with a plaquette operator that , when operating on the vacuum , creates a closed loop of chromoelectric flux  @xcite .",
    "this loop is a path on a square lattice and the glueball mass should be proportional to the length of the path . using our assumption that topologically trivial paths are too unstable to allow measurable masses and assuming that we are studying single flux tubes on the lattice ( no links ) , the first stable closed loop on the lattice will be the trefoil .",
    "the shortest length for a trefoil on a square lattice is 24 lattice spacings ( 24 tube diameters in dimensionless units ) , so , without smoothing , the lattice should predict the lightest glueball mass to be a factor of @xmath179 larger than the value we quote in the table , i.e. , @xmath180 while this naive result is only a rough approximation , it could be refined and does indicate that lattice calculations of glueball masses can come out on the high side .",
    "it is also an explanation of why our results differ from lattice predictions .",
    "in addition to not fitting naturally into the quark model  @xcite , glueballs have some other characteristic signatures , including enhanced production via gluon rich channels in the central rapidity region , branching fractions incompatible with @xmath3 decay , very weak coupling to @xmath181 , and ozi suppression .",
    "all the @xmath17-states have some or all of these properties . for instance , none have substantial branching fractions to @xmath181 .",
    "however , mixing with @xmath3 isoscalar states can obscure some of these properties .",
    "all these observations are in qualitative agreement with the model presented here .",
    "our high - fit model predicts one new state at 1190 mev , twelve states concentrated near 1700 mev and a tower of higher mass states with the next dense concentration starting near 1900 mev .",
    "the low - fit model makes similar prediction except that there is no new state near 1200 mev .",
    "we have argued that there is sufficient tension in the experimental data in these regions to allow the identification of many more states with knots and links",
    ". a careful statistical analysis of the data of all @xmath17-regions to resolve hidden states is needed .",
    "recall we are assuming that @xmath44 is intrinsic angular momentum and not rotational angular momentum as we assumed in  @xcite .    as a variant example of the models we have been considering and as a comparison",
    ", we consider a two - parameter fit to the @xmath45 data where the origin is not fixed at zero glueball mass and zero tube length .",
    "fitting the non - curvature - corrected length data to the glueball data gives a shallower slope and an intercept at positive glueball mass ; see fig .",
    "[ 2p - fit ] .",
    "while the @xmath127 is somewhat better than for the non - curvature - corrected one - parameter fit , we do not have an interpretation of the non - zero intercept other than a zero length tubular bag constant which seems rather unphysical .",

    "[ cc - low-2p - fit ] and [ cc - high-2p - fit ] the intercepts in both these models are consistent with zero . this result and in addition to the improved @xmath127 when we use the curvature - corrected knot lengths in the one - parameter fits gives us confidence that either our one - parameter ( i.e. , the slope @xmath182 ) high or one - parameter low curvature - corrected fits are the sufficient and best choices for a robust model .",

    "some prime knots have a @xmath183 symmetry leading to a potential four - fold degeneracy .",
    "the cases of links and composites are even more complicated , with a variety of higher degeneracies possible @xcite .",
    "how these degeneracies can be lifted at higher order is a topic for future research , but let us make a few comments here . since many knots and links come in more than one form , we can consider their mixings .",
    "for example , the trefoil can be left - handed @xmath184 or right - handed @xmath185 . since the trefoil can decay by changing a single crossing , changing two crossings",
    "can take @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
    "we have identified the @xmath28 with @xmath49 whose width is @xmath16 50 mev . assuming the decay is via reconnection or quantum tunneling , then we expect the @xmath184 and @xmath185 versions to mix at the @xmath186 level by changing two crossings .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath161 mev level splitting and is undetected experimentally . as the quantum state @xmath187 has self - linking number @xmath188 when properly normalized , while @xmath189 has @xmath190 , we would expect the @xmath191 to be the more stable linear combination , and the proper state to be identified with the @xmath49 .",
    "similar comments apply to all our identifications .",
    "note that the hopf link comes in only one form , so it corresponds to the single broad state @xmath37 . mixing",
    "could potentially be detected for other broad states where splitting could be a few mev , but only when they are identified with knots or links that come in more than one type .",
    "it would be trivial to extend our predictions to states above 2 gev .",
    "one just takes the knot of appropriate lengths from @xcite and scales them by the dimensionful parameter @xmath128 from the fit . however , there is insufficient mesonic data above 2 gev to improve or constrain our fit",
    ". more experimental data to test the model in this region would be very welcome .    knotted and linked magnetic fields configurations have been discussed with respect to a number of plasma phenomena including spheromaks  @xcite , astrophysical  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite objects .",
    "similar comments apply to bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and various field theories .",
    "the system we consider is intrinsically different since we assume that in qcd we have confinement into tubes and then the tubes get knotted and linked , as opposed to finding knotted or linked fields that then may or may not get confined . in our case",
    "we expect energy proportional to tube length ( with corrections as discussed in this paper ) , where the later case not involving initial confinement would not necessarily be expected to have a simple length - energy relationship .",
    "the energies and sizes of these classical solitons are sometimes difficult to quantify since they depend on parameters of the plasma , including temperature , pressure , density , ionic content , etc .",
    "however , it was argued in  @xcite that well - defined topological soliton energies can be identified for vacuum qcd or any vacuum quantum - flux - tube system .",
    "hence we emphasize that in all systems which support quantum flux tubes , including those occuring in media , from the quark - gluon plasma to superconductors , the energy spectrum of knot and link solitons will be universal up to a scaling for fixed values of parameters  @xcite .    to conclude , we have given two interpretations of the @xmath17-state data with a model of knotted chromoelectric flux tubes in qcd .",
    "the first possibility is where the @xmath120 is identified with the @xmath118 knot which results in a prediction of a new state around 1190 mev which is identified with the @xmath119 link . the other possibility  which also gives our best fit  is to identify the @xmath120 with the @xmath119 link to give a one - to - one matching of all the first twelve @xmath45 states with the first twelve knots and links .",
    "experiments could help to resolve which of these two possibilities is the correct choice .",
    "finally we should point out that there is considerable amount of tension in the @xmath45 data , as indicate by the @xmath127s of the individual states quoted by the pdg .",
