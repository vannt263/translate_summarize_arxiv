    "the high - acceptance dielectron spectrometer ( hades ) is a magnetic spectrometer in operation at the heavy ion synchrotron facility sis at gsi darmstadt .",
    "it is designed for di - electron spectroscopy in nucleus - nucleus collisions around 1 - 2 agev to study hot and dense nuclear matter .",
    "di - electron production in c+c collisions at 1 and 2 agev have been reported on @xcite . in the invariant mass region 0.15 gev/@xmath6",
    "< @xmath7 < 0.5 gev/@xmath6 the measured pair yield shows a strong excess above the contribution expected from hadron decays after freeze - out . in this mass range ,",
    "the @xmath8 dalitz decay is well under control , but two other di - electron sources which play an important role are poorly known : the @xmath1 ( 1232 ) resonance dalitz decay ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath9 bremsstrahlung ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "+ for a better understanding of the contribution from such processes , hades studied @xmath0 and @xmath11 interactions at 1.25 gev kinetic energy @xcite , just below the @xmath8 production threshold . due to the small expected contribution for the @xmath9 bremsstrahlung",
    ", the @xmath0 reaction at 1.25 gev is expected to be mostly sensitive to the @xmath1 dalitz decay @xcite .",
    "this process is studied by leptonic inclusive ( @xmath12 ) and exclusive ( @xmath13 ) channel analyses . at the same time",
    ", we measured the hadronic channels ( @xmath14 ) which provide a consistency check with the analysis of leptonic channels as well as a precise and independent control of inputs ( cross section , angular distribution , etc . ) for @xmath1 dalitz decay study .",
    "the pion production is dominated by @xmath1 excitation at @xmath15 gev , therefore , the two hadronic channels are correlated by isospin symmetry : @xmath16 , leading to @xmath17 .",
    "the hades detector , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hades_sideview ] , consists of 6 identical sectors covering the full azimuthal range and polar angles from @xmath18 to @xmath19 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "each sector contains : a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector used for electron identification ; two sets of mini - drift chambers ( mdc ) with 4 modules per sector placed in front and behind the magnetic field to determine momenta of charged particles ; the time of flight detectors ( tof / tofino ) and the pre - shower detector improving the electron identification . for reaction time measurement , a start detector",
    "is located in front of the target .",
    "an @xmath20 invariant mass resolution at the @xmath21 peak of @xmath22 and a momentum resolution for protons of @xmath23 can be achieved .",
    "the first level trigger is obtained by a fast multiplicity signal coming from the tof / tofino wall , combined with a reaction signal from the start detector , while the second level trigger is made by using the informations from the rich and pre - shower to enrich the lepton candidates signals .",
    "+ in the april 2006 experiment , we used protons at 1.25 gev kinetic energy , with an intensity of about @xmath24 particles / second , and a target filled with liquid hydrogen .",
    "the start detector was not used in this run because of the too high secondaries produced by the start detector itself .",
    "thus a specific algorithm @xcite has been developed to calculate the time of flight and then to identify the charged particles .",
    "the two hadronic channels , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , were simulated at a beam energy of 1.25 gev using the pluto event generator @xcite .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : let ] , the channels involving @xmath1 and n * resonances are simulated with the cross sections taken from @xcite . for the @xmath1 resonance production , the mass distribution and angular distribution are taken from dmitriev s calculation based on one-@xmath5 exchange model which describes very well the previous experimental data @xcite . for the @xmath1 hadronic decay , we implemented the angular differential cross section @xmath27 which is in agreement with the anisotropies measured by previous experiments @xcite ( @xmath28 is the @xmath5 polar angle in @xmath1 frame with respect to the direction of momentum transfer from @xmath29 to @xmath1 in the total center of mass ) .",
    "theoretical predictions @xcite have been used for the angular distribution of n * production since no data exist .",

    "the @xmath25 channel is studied using a reconstruction of the undetected neutron .",
    "the reaction was selected first by the charged particle identification based on momentum and reconstructed time of flight @xcite , then a ( @xmath30 ) missing mass cut was imposed around the neutron mass .",
    "this cut efficiently suppresses the background coming from misidentified protons and two-@xmath5 contributions . in the dalitz plot ( fig  .[dalitz ] ) , one can clearly see the @xmath31 signal located around @xmath32 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath33 corresponding to the squared mass of @xmath34 , while the @xmath35 signal located around @xmath36 ( gev/@xmath6)@xmath33 is less pronounced .",
    "the spot appearing in the dalitz plot for ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath30 ) invariant masses squared around 2 ( gev / c@xmath33)@xmath33 is due to the @xmath38 final state interaction ( fsi ) .",

    ", it can not fully explain the discrepancy .",
    "on the other hand , the cross section assumed here for the non - resonant contribution seems reasonable and can not be larger since it is also constrained by invariant mass distributions .",
    "but one should mention that the majority of statistics is located at forward and backward neutron angles where the yield is in agreement with the simulation and that the overall discrepancy is less than @xmath41 of the total cross section . to minimize the model dependence",
