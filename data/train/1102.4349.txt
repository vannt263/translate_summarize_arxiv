    "theory predicts that negative feedback in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) regulates the growth of supermassive black holes and their accompanying starbursts @xcite . on the scales of galaxies , radio jets power neutral and ionized outflows with significant mass and energy flux @xcite .",
    "wide - angle outflows on sub - kiloparsec scales are also common in radio - quiet systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "precisely how and to what degree these phenomena are the negative feedback predicted by theory is an area of active study .",
    "the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) mrk 231 , the nearest infrared - luminous quasi - stellar object ( qso ) , is a unique system because it hosts several types of agn outflows .",
    "it also combines many of the phenomena of interest in models of galaxy mergers that then form powerful qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclei in mrk 231 have coalesced , but prominent features of an interaction are still present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it contains a powerful , unobscured agn alongside an obscured starburst @xcite .",
    "finally , several types of outflows are present : pc and kpc - scale radio jets @xcite ; a low ionization , broad absorption line outflow with blueshifted velocities up to 8000  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably arising at pc scales ; and a kpc scale outflow with velocities exceeding 1000  .    the properties of this third outflow concern us here .",
    "blueshifted emission lines led to speculation of its existence @xcite , but emission lines are subject to misinterpretation , as blueshifted lines could indicate inflow or outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "using long slit observations , @xcite showed conclusive evidence that a @xmath11000  neutral outflow was present at galactocentric radii up to 3 kpc .",
    "more recently , this outflow was detected in the molecular phase at very similar velocities , with a marginal detection of extended emission @xcite .",
    "the structure and power source of this outflow have remained elusive .",
    "though the high velocities suggested the influence of the agn was helping to power the wind , @xcite were unable to determine whether the wind was powered by the jet or more widely - directed agn energy , and what role the starburst played .",
    "the high molecular gas velocities observed @xcite also suggest agn influence , but the spatial resolution of these observations made the power source equally difficult to determine .    in this letter , we present integral field spectroscopy of the outflow in mrk 231 , probing both the neutral and ionized phases using interstellar absorption and the  /  emission - line complex . using sub - kpc spatial resolution",
    ", we untangle the structure and dynamics of the outflow and show that jets , wide - angle agn influence , and the starburst all play a role in moving large amounts of gas out of the central regions of this galaxy .",
    "mrk 231 was observed on 2007 july 7 ut with the integral field unit in the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the gemini north telescope .",
    "cloud cover was minimal , and image quality was very high ( 05 - 06 ) .",
    "we obtained five exposures of 900 s each , at a position angle of 35  to ensure that diffraction spikes from the nuclear point source were not oriented along the north - south jet axis .",
    "our dither pattern centered on the nucleus , with exposures alternating @xmath215 along one of the field axes .",
    "we used the integral field unit in two - slit mode and the b600 grating , yielding wavelength coverage from 5600 to 6950   and a spectral resolution of 1.80at 6300 .",
    "we reduced the data using the iraf data reduction package provided by the gemini observatory , supplemented with custom idl routines .",
    "the 03 spaxels in the final data cube maximize signal - to - noise ratio while adequately sampling the seeing disk .",
    "the resulting cube contains 525 spectra and measures 63 @xmath3 75 , with the long axis oriented northeast to southwest .",
    "we modeled the continuum and emission lines in each spectrum using uhspecfit , a suite of idl routines that fits a continuum and emission lines to spectra @xcite .",
    "we fit the continuum at each point as a linear combination of the nuclear spectrum and a smooth host galaxy continuum . where possible , we fit two gaussian velocity components to the emission lines .",
    "one component represents the narrow , rotating velocity component , and the second represents an underlying broad , blueshifted component .",
    "we modeled the  absorption lines using the method of @xcite .",
    "one velocity component provided good fits throughout the cube .",
    "the nearby 5876    emission line was parameterized using the fit to other lines , but in almost all spaxels this line was absent or very weak .",
    "figure [ fig : fits ] shows six example fits to the emission and absorption lines .",
    "they illustrate the high quality of the fits .",
    "our line profile modeling is based on gaussian velocity profiles .",
    "as such , we define outflow velocities in this letter based on the properties of the normal distribution .",

    "the rotation of the central gas disk of mrk 231 has been modeled using co observations @xcite , yielding a projected velocity amplitude of 70  along the 90@xmath6 line of nodes and a disk inclination of @xmath7 .",
    "this molecular gas is concentrated in a @xmath8  kpc disk @xcite . from co and observations",

    "our data trace this rotation to larger radii than the co observations .",

    "kpc of the nucleus , the center velocity of the second component averages @xmath11  , with larger velocities closer to the nucleus . because these components are also very broad , with @xmath12fwhm@xmath13  , the ionized gas reaches @xmath14  .",
    "the region of broad , blueshifted emission is asymmetric , with higher velocities to the north and more extended emission to the east .",

    "( closer than 0.5  kpc , the nuclear emission washes out the signature of the host galaxy . ) a significant area of absorption is also seen atop the blue continuum peak 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus .",
    "the neutral gas velocities are also much higher than the ionized gas velocities .",
    "the  velocity maps consist of three distinct regions , whose velocity averages are found in table [ tab : vels ] .",

    "higher velocity , broader components are found in the outflow surrounding the nucleus ( not including the northern quadrant ) .",
    "the highest velocities are found in the northern quadrant of the nuclear outflow . in those parts of the northern quadrant that line up with the radio jet in mrk  231 , the velocities reach @xmath161400  .",
    "the velocities observed in the arc are comparable to those measured in starburst - dominated ulirgs ( table [ tab : vels ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , those in the nuclear wind are significantly higher ; they are more like those found in some seyfert ulirgs @xcite .",
    "ulirgs host powerful starburst - driven outflows @xcite that arise in all ulirgs @xcite and show kpc scale extents @xcite .",
    "they have @xmath17  in systems whose infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculate that ulirg mass outflow rates are 20%  of the star formation rate on average .",
    "however , evidence has remained elusive for large - scale outflows that are clearly agn - driven in lirgs or ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the data we present here are clear : there is a neutral , @xmath51000  outflow in mrk 231 that extends in every direction from the nucleus ( as projected into the plane of the sky ) out to at least 3 kpc .",
    "such high velocities have not been seen in starburst ulirgs ( table [ tab : vels ] ) , providing strong circumstantial evidence that this wide - angle nuclear wind is driven by radiation or mechanical energy from the agn .    from what we know about the structure of galactic winds @xcite , the molecular disk in mrk 231 collimates this nuclear wind . given the disk s",
    "almost face - on orientation , we must be looking `` down the barrel '' of a biconical outflow .",
    "the other end of this bicone is receding from us , behind the galaxy disk and therefore invisible at optical wavelengths .",
    "it is apparent from the velocity map that the north@xmath16south radio jet in mrk 231 @xcite is coupling to the nuclear wind , accelerating the neutral gas to even higher velocities .",
    "the jet is not constrained to emerge perpendicular to the disk , and thus produces an asymmetric effect .",
    "the present data imply that the northern arm of the large - scale jet is on the near side of the molecular disk .",
    "neutral outflows driven by jet interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) on kpc scales have also been observed in radio galaxies in absorption @xcite .",
    "the newly discovered jet - wind interaction in mrk 231 appears to be similar , though this time the jet accelerates an already in situ wind .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the diffuse radio continuum emission from mrk  231 , which is symmetric about the nucleus on scales of 100  pc to 1  kpc .",
    "they hypothesized that this emission is produced by in situ electron acceleration , but could not rule out that the agn distributes these electrons through a wide - angle outflow .",
    "our data are further evidence for the in situ interpretation , since we now know that the agn outflow reaches larger scales and is asymmetrically accelerated .    along with these agn - driven outflows ,",
    "mrk 231 also hosts a starburst - driven wind .",
    "blueshifted velocities with @xmath18  are observed in the star - forming arc south of the nucleus . these are comparable to the maximum velocities observed in other starburst ulirgs ( table [ tab : vels ] )",
    ". we can not rule out that the underlying continuum could be backlighting the nuclear wind at this location .",
    "however , a simpler explanation is that in situ star formation is driving an off - nuclear wind .    the ionized outflow in mrk 231 overlaps spatially with the neutral outflow near the nucleus and shows broad velocity profiles .",
    "it also shows higher velocities to the north .",
    "however , the velocities and extent of this wind phase are more modest",
    ". the ionized outflow in mrk 231 could be another phase of the nuclear wind , providing further evidence that the different gas phases in ulirg winds are not strongly coupled @xcite .",
    "it may also be the classic agn narrow line region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclear wind is clearly the one detected previously in the neutral @xcite and molecular @xcite phases .",
    "@xcite found an extended wind ( on kpc scales ) , but only had data in a north - south slice .",
    "@xcite marginally resolved the molecular component out to radii of @xmath50.6  kpc , and estimated molecular mass and energy fluxes of several hundred  and @xmath510@xmath19 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "the current data are a significant improvement on these results .",
    "they clearly resolve the structure of the wind on sub - kpc scales and reveal that more than one power source is acting . to produce a wide - angle outflow , the agn energy and momentum",
    "must be injected into the ism over a substantial volume through mechanical or radiative processes .",
    "either ( 1 ) wide - angle winds from the agn accretion disk or broad line region or ( 2 ) coupling of the agn radiation to the dust in the wind are possible explanations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the high - velocity component of the wind that lies north of the nucleus must experience an additional , asymmetric force .",
    "the north - south jet in mrk 231 is a natural explanation .    using a simple model",
    ", we can estimate the mass and energy fluxes ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) in the nuclear wind @xcite .",
    "we assume a face - on wind for simplicity .",
    "we model the wind as emanating from the nucleus in a thin shell , and compute a time - averaged mass flux . @xcite",
    "also discuss a thick - shell model .",
    "however , computing the mass outflow rate for this model would require integrating hypothetical velocity profiles over each line of sight ; such an exercise is beyond the scope of this letter and would increase the number of unconstrained parameters .",
    "there are two significant unknowns in the thin shell model .",
    "the first is the radius of the shell . given the spatial smoothness of the velocity map , it must be larger than 2  kpc , or we would observe the velocity to decrease ( in projection ) with increasing radius .",
    "however , it can not be too large , or we would observe a more extended absorption region .",
    "we use a fiducial radius of 3  kpc ; larger values will increase the resulting @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the second uncertainty is the ionization state of na . as in previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use milky way measurements as a baseline and assume",
    "@xmath22()/@xmath22(na ) @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ionization fraction",
    ". the fluxes are inversely proportional to @xmath25 , such that a more ionized wind will yield higher @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    with this model ,",
    "we compute @xmath20 @xmath26 420 ( @xmath27/3  kpc ) @xmath28 $ ]  and @xmath21 @xmath26 @xmath29 ( @xmath27/3  kpc ) @xmath28 $ ] erg s@xmath10 . for comparison ,",
    "the star formation rate and agn luminosity in mrk 231 are 172  and @xmath30 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "( these numbers are computed by assuming the bulk of the galaxy s radiation emerges in the far - infrared , using the agn contribution to mrk  231 s bolometric luminosity from @xcite , and calculating the star formation rate with the formula from @xcite . )",
    "the wind is clearly removing significant amounts of gas from the nucleus  at a level of 2.5 times the star formation rate .",
    "this mass outflow rate is also strikingly similar to that estimated by @xcite from a different tracer .",
    "the energy outflow rate is about 0.7%  of the radiative luminosity of the agn , meaning that only a small part of the radiative output of the agn has to couple to the outflow .",
    "this is remarkably similar to the required coupling efficiency needed for an agn wind in the two - phase model of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the agn couples to the hot ism , driving a diffuse outflow .",
    "this diffuse outflow disrupts cold clouds , which are propelled outward by the diffuse wind and by radiation pressure from the agn .",
    "together , the hot and cold winds provide negative feedback on the agn and star formation .",
    "the galaxy mrk 231 is in the late stages of a major merger , hosts a qso and an obscured starburst , and exhibits gas outflows in multiple forms .",
    "we show in this letter that there is a massive , energetic , and neutral outflow extending in all directions from the nucleus ( as projected in the plane of the sky ) to radii of at least 3 kpc .",
    "this outflow has blueshifted velocities that reach 1100  . on the axis of the radio jet in mrk  231",
    ", @xmath31 is as large as 1400  .",
    "mass and energy outflow rates are @xmath12.5@xmath3 the star formation rate and @xmath10.7%  of the agn luminosity .",
    "the former suggests strong negative feedback to star formation , and the latter is consistent with the coupling efficiency required in the agn feedback model of @xcite .    by comparing the velocities in this wind to those in the average starburst - driven ulirg ,",
    "we conclude that this wide - angle wind is likely powered by the central agn , and its power source must be directed fairly symmetrically .",
    "the northern quadrant of this nuclear outflow experiences additional acceleration due to the radio jet in mrk  231 .",
    "furthermore , a starburst - powered wind arises in the extended galaxy disk to the south of the nucleus .",
    "these data illuminate the structure and power source of the kpc scale wind in mrk 231 , and show that strong feedback occurs as a result .",
    "the ubiquity of winds in major mergers is well - known , but our understanding of their full impact on galaxy evolution is improving through integral field observations ( @xcite and the present work ) , herschel studies @xcite , and ground - based molecular observations @xcite .",
