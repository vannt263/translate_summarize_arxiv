    "we investigate the run length of a cycle or path @xmath11 which occurs in a grid graph @xmath3 . a _ grid graph _ is the cartesian product @xmath12 where the @xmath1 are either cycles or paths .",
    "the grid graph @xmath13 is said to be _ k - dimensional _ , and we sometimes refer to @xmath1 as a _ dimension _ of @xmath3 . the _ size _ of the dimension is the number of vertices in @xmath1 .",
    "torus _ or _",
    "toroidal grid graph _ is a grid graph where each @xmath1 is a cycle .",
    "a grid graph is _ directed _ if each @xmath1 is directed and _ undirected _ if no @xmath1 is directed .",
    "the _ run length _ of a cycle or path @xmath11 in a grid graph , denoted @xmath14 , is the maximum number @xmath2 such that any sequence of @xmath2 consecutive edges in @xmath11 contains no more than one edge in any one dimension .",
    "the _ maximum run length _ of a grid graph or @xmath15 is the maximum @xmath14 for all hamiltonian cycles @xmath11 in @xmath3 , that is , for all cycles which pass through each vertex exactly once .",
    "run length first arose in computing applications .",
    "since every hamiltonian path in a torus corresponds to a listing of the coordinates of consecutive vertices , a path on a @xmath4-cube corresponds to a gray code , i.e. , a listing of all @xmath4-bit binary words in such a way that any two consecutive words differ in only one bit position .",
    "the _ gap _ of a gray code is the run length of the corresponding hamiltonian path .",
    "electronic position - to - digital converters such as photon detectors use a hamiltonian path to match each received photon to a binary code word representing position , and machine error decreases as the code s gap increases .",
    "( see goddyn et al .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed explanation . )",
    "the run length of hamiltonian cycles on @xmath4-cubes was addressed in 1988 by goddyn , lawrence , and nemeth @xcite , who investigated the gap of @xmath4-bit gray codes and gave methods for producing them which achieve a gap that approaches @xmath16 for large @xmath4 .",
    "in 2001 , goddyn and gvozdjak @xcite placed a lower bound on the gap of a gray code which is also a lower bound on the maximum run length of a @xmath4-cube @xmath17 .",
    "they showed that @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , ruskey and sawada @xcite thoroughly investigated the case of _ bent _ hamiltonian paths and cycles , those whose run length is at least 2 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a @xmath4-dimensional torus , then @xmath21 either when @xmath22 or when @xmath23 and the sizes of the dimensions are even . if @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional non - toroidal grid graph and @xmath24 , then @xmath21 if and only if the size of some dimension is even .",
    "ruskey and sawada also give conditions for the existence of bent hamiltonian paths in graphs without bent cycles .",
    "in this paper , we give lower bounds for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath11 is a hamiltonian cycle in a torus @xmath3 , by presenting several methods for producing cycles of high run length . as explained in section  [ secdecomp ] , one method considers the cartesian product @xmath3 of tori @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a hamiltonian cycle @xmath11 can be constructed in @xmath3 from hamiltonian cycles @xmath27 in @xmath25 and @xmath28 in @xmath26 where @xmath14 is greater than either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and we give conditions for producing such an @xmath11 with run length greater than 2 .",
    "these methods may be easily applied inductively to the cases where @xmath31 and @xmath32 for a fixed odd prime @xmath8 and for nonnegative integers @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for situations",
    "where this method is not applicable , section  [ secdim ] provides a simpler method of combining two grid graphs @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath14 is merely equal to @xmath29 or @xmath30 . throughout , except for a few cases we have noted in the text , every result for finding hamiltonian cycles can be easily adapted to find hamiltonian paths as well .",
    "our primary method for finding hamiltonian cycles with high run length consists of combining two or more hamiltonian cycles to construct another hamiltonian cycle in their product ; this method is modeled after those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "say the grid graph @xmath25 is the cartesian product of cycles and @xmath26 is @xmath35 , and let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be hamiltonian cycles in @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "then any hamiltonian cycle @xmath11 in @xmath36 is also a hamiltonian cycle in @xmath37 .",
    "we could consider @xmath11 a cycle in the @xmath4-dimensional torus @xmath13 or in the two - dimensional torus @xmath36 , as demonstrated in figure  [ comp ] . if each @xmath1 in figure  [ comp ] is a cycle on two vertices , and if @xmath27 is a cycle in @xmath38 and @xmath28 is a cycle in @xmath39 , then an @xmath11 which is hamiltonian in @xmath40 is hamiltonian in @xmath41 .",
    "we can even determine the run length of @xmath11 from this representation .",
    "note that @xmath11 takes three edges from the @xmath28 dimension followed by one from @xmath27 , and then repeats ; if @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then any adjacent four edges come from different dimensions .",
    "however , since @xmath44 , any three adjacent edges from @xmath28 may repeat a dimension , and so the run length may be no greater than two .",
    "we do know that any two adjacent edges are from different dimensions and thus that @xmath14 is at least 2 .",
    "note that , to avoid difficulty , we can construct such an @xmath11 by assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 are directed . in order to maximize @xmath14",
    ", we repeat an edge from the same dimension of @xmath45 as seldom as possible .",
    "this construction suggests the following theorem , couched in terms of @xmath15 , the maximum run length of any hamiltonian cycle @xmath11 in @xmath3 . if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 , the number of vertices in the grid graph @xmath3 , is given by @xmath48 .",

    "any @xmath56 consecutive edges contain @xmath49 from the dimension @xmath27 and @xmath50 from the dimension @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , any such subsequence of @xmath56 consecutive edges uniquely determines the rest of the cycle or cover of cycles .",
    "condition  [ cond1 ] , on the other hand , ensures that @xmath11 is a single hamiltonian cycle rather than a cover of cycles since @xmath57 gives the number of disjoint cycles in any such cover .",
    "subject to these conditions , we describe a construction to maximize @xmath14 based on the methods of goddyn et al .",

    "[ rlk ] if @xmath12 is directed , then @xmath72 .",
    "recall that the method introduced in theorem  [ st1 ] treats @xmath27 and @xmath28 as if they are directed .",
    "the theorem of trotter and erds gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a hamiltonian cycle in the product of exactly two directed cycles ; thus , the conditions imposed are sufficient for the existence of cycles in @xmath3 if it is undirected but are also necessary if it is considered as the product of directed cycles @xmath36 . in our case , any cycle in @xmath3 can be decomposed into a cycle in @xmath36 for some directed @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "that is , if any directed graph @xmath73 has maximum run length equal to @xmath74 , then , for some ordering of the edges , there is a cycle in the graph which consists of the repeated subsequence of one edge from @xmath75 , then one from @xmath76 , @xmath77 , one from @xmath1 , another one from @xmath75 , etc .",
