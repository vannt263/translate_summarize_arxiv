    "<S> beam asymmetries for the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been measured with the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) and a tagged , linearly polarized photon beam with energies from 1.102 to 1.862 gev . </S>",
    "<S> a fourier moment technique for extracting beam asymmetries from experimental data is described . </S>",
    "<S> the results reported here possess greater precision and finer energy resolution than previous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our data for both pion reactions appear to favor the said and bonn - gatchina scattering analyses over the older mainz maid predictions . after incorporating the present set of beam asymmetries into the world database , exploratory fits made with the said analysis </S>",
    "<S> indicate that the largest changes from previous fits are for properties of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states . </S>"
