    "<S> we study composite solitons , consisting of domain walls and vortex lines attaching to the walls in two - component bose - einstein condensates . when the total density of two components is homogeneous , the system can be mapped to the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model for the pseudospin representing the two - component order parameter and the analytical solutions of the composite solitons can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> based on the analytical solutions , we discuss the detailed structure of the composite solitons in two - component condensates by employing the generalized nonlinear sigma model , where all degrees of freedom of the original gross - pitaevskii theory are active . the density inhomogeneity results in reduction of the domain wall tension from that in the sigma model limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the domain wall pulled by a vortex is logarithmically bent as a membrane pulled by a pin , and it bends more flexibly than not only the domain wall in the sigma model but also the expectation from the reduced tension . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the composite soliton structure for actual experimental situations with trapped immiscible condensates under rotation through numerical simulations of the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations . </S>"
