    "@xmath0al @xmath3-decays to the first excited state of @xmath0 mg , which emits a @xmath4-ray of 1809 kev energy .",
    "these @xmath4-rays were initially detected by the third high energy astronomy observatory ( heao3 ) satellite @xcite , the solar maximum mission satellite @xcite , gamma - ray imaging spectrometer ( gris ) @xcite , and others in the last century .",
    "subsequently , an all - sky image of @xmath0al @xmath4-ray emission at 1809 kev was derived from the comptel instrument on - board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) @xcite , and further refined by integral data , which showed that the @xmath0al co - rotates with the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this map provides information about star formation and nucleosynthesis over a time period comparable to the half - life of @xmath0al ( 7.17 @xmath5 10@xmath6 y ) .",
    "it has also been observed that @xmath0 mg is overabundant in some meteoritic inclusions , which is attributed to the decay of @xmath0al @xcite .",
    "it implies that live @xmath0al was present during the formation of the meteorites .",
    "since the parent bodies of meteorites were formed during the early stages of the solar system , this observation may provide information about the last nucleosynthesis events that contributed matter to the solar nebula .",
    "the galactic abundance of @xmath0al depends largely on the rates of the reactions that lead to its production and destruction .",
    "the main production mechanism in a variety of sites , such as massive stars or agb stars , is the @xmath7mg@xmath8al reaction , while the main destruction mechanisms at higher temperatures are the @xmath0al@xmath1 mg and @xmath0al@xmath2na reactions @xcite .",
    "massive stars may produce @xmath0al during different phases of their evolution : ( i ) during pre - supernova stages in the c / ne convective shell , near temperatures of @xmath9 1 gk , where a fraction of the @xmath0al survives the subsequent explosion and is ejected into the interstellar medium @xcite ; ( ii ) during core collapse via explosive ne / c burning @xcite , near temperatures of @xmath9 2 gk , where the ejected @xmath0al yield may perharps be modified by the @xmath10-process via neutrino spallation @xcite ; and ( iii ) in wolf - rayet stars , i.e. , stars with masses in excess of about 30 _ m@xmath11 _ , during core hydrogen burning , near temperatures of @xmath9 0.1 gk , where @xmath0al may appear via convection at the surface and , subsequently , is ejected by strong stellar winds @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0al production mechanisms ( with the exception of the @xmath10-process ) were recently analyzed in detail by limongi and chieffi @xcite by using extensive hydrodynamic simulations of solar metallicity stars in the mass range of 11__m@xmath11 _ _",
    "@xmath12 120__m@xmath11__. in that work , they also emphasized the impact of rate uncertainties for selected reactions on the final @xmath0al yields .",
    "direct measurement of the important @xmath0al@xmath1 mg and @xmath0al@xmath2na reactions are challenging .",
    "thus the cross sections of these reactions are evaluated in this work with the codes empire @xcite and talys @xcite using different prescriptions for level densities and optical model potentials . in sec .",

    "[ sec4 ] , we present recommended reaction rates .",
    "reaction rates involving the isomeric state in @xmath0al are discussed in the appendix .",
    "despite the astrophysical importance of the reactions that destroy @xmath0al , the available data are sparse .",
    "this is largely because @xmath0al is radioactive and its natural abundance is very small .",
    "thus the preparation of a suitable target becomes a challenge . in order to overcome this hurdle , earlier experimental efforts focussed on measuring the inverse reactions @xmath0mg@xmath13al and @xmath14na(@xmath15al and",
    ", using the principle of detailed balance , determined the forward reaction cross sections for the transitions to the ground states of @xmath0 mg or @xmath14na .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure does not provide any information on reaction channels populating excited states , which may represent the dominant contributions .",

    "[ thr2 ] . up to about 2 mev bombarding energy , the main contribution to",
    "the non - elastic cross section arises from compound nuclear reactions .",
    "since this energy region is the most relevant to the reaction rates , we can conclude that pre - equilibrum and direct processes are negligible .",
    "this explains the general level of agreement between the three codes .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see that there are differences , which are probably attributable to differences in the input parameters used in each calculation .",
    "a major goal of the present study was to explore the sensitivity of the theoretical reaction rates to variations in the model parameters .",
    "the main ingredients of the hauser - feshbach ( hf ) model are the optical model parameters ( used to determine the transmission coefficients ) and the nuclear level densities .",
    "the latter are experimentally known up to some excitation energy beyond which one needs to employ a level density model .",
    "thus most nuclear level density models agree at low excitation energies , but may differ greatly at higher excitation energies .",
    "we started by varying the level densities .",
    "for the empire code , we explored the empire - specific and the gilbert cameron ( gc ) models .",
    "the empire - specific model combines the super - fluid @xcite and fermi - gas ( fg ) models @xcite with deformation - dependent collective effects .",
    "the gilbert cameron model is a combination of the constant temperature ( ct ) model @xcite at low energy and the fermi - gas model @xcite at higher energy .",
    "this model has been parameterized by ignatyuk @xcite , iljinov @xcite , and young @xcite .",
    "figure @xmath32 shows the results of cross section calculations using empire with the different options for the level density model .",
    "one can see that the cross sections obtained from these calculations are similar up to a certain value at high energy beyond which they appear to deviate from one another .",
    "this is not unexpected since the energy levels are experimentally known up to a particular excitation energy ( i.e. , the discrete region ) , while different theoretical prescriptions are used for higher energies ( i.e. , the continuum region ) .",

    "the rates are very similar in magnitude at astrophysically relevant temperatures ( t = 0.01 - 10 gk ) .",
