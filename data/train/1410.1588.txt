    "the study of plasmonic effects in graphene structures has attracted a special interest from the nanoplasmonics research community due to novel functionalities delivered by such systems , including a strong confinement by a graphene layer and tunability of graphene properties through doping or electrostatic gating  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments provided the evidence for the existence of _ graphene plasmons _ revealed by means of the scattering near - field microscopy and the nanoimaging methods  @xcite .",
    "being guided by a graphene monolayer , p - polarized plasmons are extremely short - wavelength , and their excitation is rather challenging . in order to decrease the plasmon wavenumbers ,",
    "multilayer graphene structures can be employed  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to realize coupling of graphene plasmons with light , the in - plane momentum matching can be attained in the graphene structures with a broken translational invariance , such as graphene patterned periodically in arrays of nanoribbons  @xcite or disks  @xcite .",
    "being regarded as direct analogs to metal nanoparticles , finite - extent nanoflakes are created by nanostructuring of graphene in the form of disks , rings , and triangles , and they can sustain localized surface plasmons .",
    "importantly , a tight confinement of graphene plasmons results in the field enhancement indispensable for the observation of strong nonlinear effects . in this respect , nonlinear response of graphene structures and plasmonic phenomena with graphene still remain largely unexplored .    in this paper , we study nonlinear effects in periodic arrays of single - layer graphene nanodisks excited by an external field .",
    "we assume that the nanodisks possess a nonlinear response due to the graphene nonlinearity , and demonstrate that this system can support different classes of localized modes comprising several coupled nanodisks characterized by the local field enhancement , the so - called _ discrete dissipative plasmon solitons _ , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we derive the nonlinear equations describing the evolution of the disks polarization components , taking into account graphene nonlinear response , intrinsic graphene losses , and a full dipole - dipole coupling between the graphene nanodisks .",
    "we reveal that this nonlinear system can support both scalar and vector discrete dissipative solitons and , depending on the inclination of the incident wave , these nonlinear modes can move gradually along the chain .",
    "we believe that our results may be useful for initiating the experimental studies of nonlinear effects in the photonic systems with nanostructured graphene .",
    "we consider an one - dimensional chain of identical graphene circular nanodisks driven by an external plane wave , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we assume that the radius of a single disk , @xmath0 , varies from @xmath1  nm to @xmath2  nm , the array period @xmath3 satisfies the condition @xmath4 , and the wavelength of the driving field is much larger than a single disk , so that we can neglect boundary , nonlocal , and quantum finite - size effects  @xcite , and treat disks as point dipoles @xcite .",
    "we also employ the linear surface conductivity as that of a homogeneous graphene sheet , which , at the relatively low photon energies , @xmath5 , can be written in terms of the drude model as follows  @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the elementary charge , @xmath8 is the fermi energy , @xmath9 is the doping electron density , @xmath10 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath11 is a relaxation time ( we assume @xmath12 time dependence ) .",
    "hereinafter , for doped graphene we account for intraband transitions only and disregard both interband transitions and temperature effects , implying @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 is the absolute temperature .        under accepted approximations ,",
    "the linear response of graphene nanodisks can be characterized via the disk polarizability , written as follows  @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dielectric permittivities of the substrate and superstrate located below and upper a graphene nanodisk .",
    "being size- and material - independent , the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are extracted from numerical simulations of maxwell s equations by the boundary element method  @xcite , where graphene is modeled as a thin layer of the thickness @xmath25  nm being described by volume dielectric permittivity , @xmath26 equation   results in the following expression for the eigenfrequency of the dipole plasmon  @xcite @xmath27 we notice that @xmath28 can be tuned by doping ( @xmath29-shift ) or shape - cut , which may assist matching waves of different polarizations in circuits based on patterned graphene .    within the dipole approximation , the local electric field in disks",
    "is supposed to be homogeneous . to identify it ,",
    "we model disks as spheroids of the permittivity  . by comparison of eq .   and the polarizability of an oblate spheroid  @xcite , one can conclude that the ratio between semi - minor axis @xmath30 of an equivalent ellipsoid and the thickness @xmath31 should be about @xmath32 . to account for the influence of graphene nonlinearity on the disks polarizations , we define the nonlinear dielectric permittivity as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the local field in @xmath9-th disk , and cubic volume susceptibility , @xmath35 is expressed through the nonlinear self - action correction to the graphene conductivity , in the local quasi - classical approximation given by  @xcite @xmath36 next , we study the chain of graphene nanodisks driven by an optical field with the frequency close to he frequency @xmath37 , and analyze the dynamical response of the disks polarizations , @xmath38 . by employing the dispersion relation method  @xcite , we derive the following system of coupled nonlinear equations for the slowly varying amplitudes of the disk dipole moments , @xmath39 where @xmath40 while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the normalized slowly varying envelopes of the disk dipole moments and the external field , indexes @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for transversal and longitudinal components with respect to the chain axis , @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the speed of light , @xmath50 is the depolarization factor of the ellipsoid , @xmath51 describes both thermal and radiation energy losses , @xmath52 importantly , this model involves all disk interactions through the full dipole fields , and it can be applied to both finite and infinite chains .",
    "it should be noted that the disk polarizability across the flake plane is supposed to be zero owing to atomic - scale thickness of graphene .",
    "it was shown that a similar model descrbing arrays of metal nanoparticles exhibits interesting nonlinear dynamics for one- and two - dimensional arrays , including the generation of kinks , oscillons , and dissipative solitons  @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on one - dimensional _ bright _ localized soliton solutions similar of those are known for various discrete dissipative systems  @xcite .    ;",
    "longitudinally polarized solitons , ( b ) @xmath53 , ( c ) @xmath54 ( green line corresponds to the bound state ) . ]",
    "by varying the pump configuration , we can decouple the nonlinear equations   and analyze _ scalar solitons _ in each of the polarization components separately .",
    "however , in a general case , the polarization components remain coupled , and we should study the case of two - component , or _",
    "vector solitons_.    in our calculations throughout this paper , we employ the following set of parameters : @xmath55 nm , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ev , @xmath58 ps , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ev ( which corresponds to the wavelength @xmath61 @xmath62 m ) . however , we notice that , within our model , the results remain valid for a broad range of parameters , which can be adjusted for controlling the effect .",
    "first , we excite the chain by a homogeneous electric field with two polarizations : ( i ) @xmath63 and ( ii ) @xmath64 . assuming the driving radiation , e.g. normally incident pump plane wave , has the in - plane electric field component either across or along the chain axis , we solve the decoupled equations of the system eqs .  .",
    "since dissipative solitons are supposed to nest on a stable background , we begin with the analysis of a steady homogeneous state and inspecting its modulational stability . for an infinite chain , following  @xcite , we find analytically the homogeneous stationary solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dynamiceq ] ) which are characterized by bistability at @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the transversal and longitudinal excitations , respectively , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a , b ) . for finite chains , conclusions drawn from the analytical considerations have to be verified numerically since the edges may produce additional boundary instabilities",
    "however , typically discrete solitons exist inside or nearby a bistability domain . therefore , we will focus on these regions to identify soliton families .    in practice ,",
    "dissipative solitons can be formed , for instance , when the chain is subject to additional narrow beam pulses .",
    "another way for formation of solitons is the collision of switching waves ( kinks )  @xcite , step - like distributions which connect quasi - homogeneous levels corresponding to the top and low branches of a bistable curve . in this way ,",
    "discrete solitons are frequently interpreted as two tightly bound kinks with the opposite polarities .    applying the standard newton iteration scheme for a finite chain of 101 disks",
    ", we find families of bright solitons , characterized by a snaking bifurcation behavior  @xcite , and simultaneously determine their stability , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "remarkably , longitudinal solitons also appear outside the bistability area , where a homogeneous steady state solution is a single - valued function of the pump , provided that the character of the bifurcation is subcritical , particularly , in the certain range of frequencies , @xmath67 , for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "examples of the soliton profiles are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .    within the homogeneous excitation",
    ", solitons always stand at rest regardless their width because the effective periodic potential created by the chain requires a finite value of the applied external force to start soliton s motion  @xcite . in order to study soliton mobility ,",
    "we excite the chain by the tilted light incidence : @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the longitudinal wavenumber .     , @xmath71 , ( b ) three - peak transverse soliton at @xmath72 , @xmath73 , ( c ) one - hump longitudinal soliton coexisting with a bound state ( d ) containing two peaks at @xmath53 , @xmath74 , sitting on the background of a homogeneous steady state solution .",

    "in contrast to cavity solitons in a model with the nearest - neighbor purely real coupling and focusing nonlinearity  @xcite , the longitudinally polarized one - peak solitons remain trapped at any value of @xmath70 .",
    "this is associated with the imaginary part of the dipole - dipole interaction . however , wide enough transverse solitons are susceptible to a propelling force .",
    "example of multi - peaked moving solitons is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the soliton looses its symmetry [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : fig4](b , d ) ] and , in the presence of an in - plane momentum exceeding some critical value , the soliton starts moving along the chain towards the edge where it gets trapped as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](e ) .      remarkably , coupled equations   also support two - component vector solitons with a mixed polarization when the excited field contains both nonzero components , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , see examples in fig .",

    "in our analysis presented above , we have operated with dimensionless variables . to estimate the feasibility of the predicted phenomena",
    ", we should recover physical values and realistic parameters .",
    "in particular , eqs .  ,   provide the estimate of @xmath85  esu for typical parameters , and the dimensionless intensity of the external field , @xmath86 , corresponds to the physical intensity of @xmath87  kw/@xmath88 . even accounting for the local field enhancement inside the graphene nanodisks , the characteristic time scales at which the solitons are formed are estimated to be less than the pulse duration that may cause a graphene damage at the given intensities  @xcite . thus , there are expectations for the experimental observation of the predicted nonlinear effect .    in summary , we have studied nonlinear dynamics in nonlinear arrays of graphene nanodisks in the presence of a pumped external field .",
    "we have derived nonlinear equations describing the evolution of the nanodisks polarization , taking into account losses in graphene and a dipole - dipole coupling between the nanodisks .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of families of discrete dissipative solitons and also revealed that such solitons can propagate stably along the chain provided they are excited by the tilted field . we have predicted a new class of discrete vector solitons composed of two mutually coupled polarization components .",
