    "the data on production of particles in relativistic heavy ion collisions collected during the operation of the rhic accelerator @xcite indicate that the wounded nucleon model @xcite , does not describe correctly the observed particle multiplicities .",
    "contrary to the model predictions , the particle density per one wounded nucleon in the central rapidity region ( i ) increases slowly with centrality of the collision and ( ii ) substantially exceeds that observed in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "this is not too surprising because the model was always considered only as a first , rough approximation .",
    "indeed , soon after the original model was formulated , a possible improvement was proposed in the form of the wounded quark model @xcite .",
    "recently , it was suggested @xcite that the wounded quark model can account for the main features of the data in the central rapidity region . to obtain this result , however , it was necessary to assume a rather large number of quark - quark collisions in the nucleon - nucleon scattering which is difficult to justify .",
    "if more realistic value of this number is used , the model predicts larger multiplicities than actually observed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these results show that the idea of a wounded constituent model may be not far from reality .    in the present paper",
    "we propose another generalization of the wounded nucleon model , based on the idea that the nucleon is composed of two constituents : one constituent quark forming a colour triplet and one constituent diquark forming a colour antitriplet .",
    "we assume , furthermore , ( i ) that particle production from these constituents is independent of the number of interactions they underwent and ( ii ) both constituents produce the same number of particles .",
    "it turns out that these two assumptions are sufficient to describe correctly the phobos data @xcite on particle production in the central ( @xmath0 ) rapidity region .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the model in more detail . in section 3 the determination of the model parameters from proton - proton elastic scattering",
    "is described .",
    "particle production in au - au collisions is discussed and compared with the phobos data in section 4 .",
    "our comments and conclusions are listed in the last section .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , we assume that in the soft collisions nucleon can be approximated by a system composed of the two constituents - a quark and a diquark - acting independently .    for the process of particle production",
    "we assume that each constituent ( quark or diquark ) which underwent at least one inelastic collision emits a certain amount of secondary partons .",
    "this number is independent of the number of collisions this constituent underwent afterwards . as this is obviously a straightforward generalization of the wounded nucleon concept we call them wounded constituents .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the wounded constituent quark and diquark emit secondary partons in approximately the same manner .",
    "the arguments in favour of such an approach are collected in the last section . here",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that they may apply only to _ soft _ collisions , i.e. those in which the transverse mass of the emitted partons does not exceed @xmath1 mev .",
    "the analogous limits for the observed hadrons are , naturally , somewhat higher .",
    "it should be also pointed out that the proposed description can only be justified far from the fragmentation regions of the projectile and of the target . therefore in this paper",
    "we restrict the comparison with the data to the central rapidity region .",
    "the consequence of these assumptions , fundamental for our conclusions , is that the differential multiplicity of partons emitted in the nucleus - nucleus inelastic collisions can be represented as:@xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the numbers of wounded constituents ( quarks and diquarks ) in nucleus @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the differential multiplicities of partons emitted by one wounded constituent in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "when ( [ ab ] ) is applied to nucleon - nucleon collisions we obtain : @xmath9   .",

    "we obtain the particularly simple and elegant result : @xmath11 since the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "is independent of the phase - space region where @xmath12 is measured , but depends on the centrality of the collision , this is indeed a very strong consequence of the model .    at the vanishing c.m .",
    "rapidity , ( [ ab ] ) and ( [ nn ] ) imply a simple relation even for asymmetric collisions : @xmath13    to make a full use of ( [ start ] ) and ( [ start ] ) , it is necessary to evaluate @xmath14 and @xmath15 as function of the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "the corresponding formulae are obtained by a straightforward counting of probabilities @xcite . for the average number of wounded quarks and diquarks in each of the colliding nuclei ( @xmath16 ) , at a fixed impact parameter @xmath17 , one obtains:@xmath18   ^{a}\\left [   1-\\sigma_{ad}t_{ad}\\left ( s\\right )   \\right ]   ^{a}\\right )   d^{2}s , \\label{www}%\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes @xmath20 or @xmath21",

    "] , @xmath28 is the nuclear thickness function ( normalized to unity ) .",
    "@xmath29 is given by:@xmath30 where @xmath31 are the differential cross - sections of the constituents ( in impact parameter plane ) and @xmath32 are the corresponding total inelastic cross - sections ( @xmath33 denotes @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that the formulae ( [ www ] ) and ( [ tab ] ) take into account the impact parameter dependence of the constituent cross - sections .",
    "if this dependence is neglected [ @xmath36 , @xmath37 .    for the number of wounded constituents in nucleon - nucleon collisions we have , similarly , @xmath38 with : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross - section and @xmath41 is given by:@xmath42 [ 1-\\sigma_{aq}(b+s_{q}^{\\prime}-s_{a})]\\right\\ }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 being the effective thickness of the nucleon .",
    "it remains to determine the cross - sections of the constituents and their distribution inside the nucleon .",

    "the distribution of the constituents inside the nucleon and their cross - sections are not known .",
    "we propose to determine them from the analysis of the data on proton - proton elastic scattering .",
    "consider first the inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "following the idea that the interaction can be described as the interaction of two independent constituents in each of the nucleons , we have @xcite : @xmath44[1-\\sigma_{qd}(b+s_{d}^{\\prime}-s_{q}% ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   [ 1-\\sigma_{dq}(b+s_{q}^{\\prime}-s_{d})][1-\\sigma_{dd}(b+s_{d}^{\\prime } -s_{d})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and@xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 are transverse positions of the quarks and diquarks in the two colliding nucleons .    from the unitarity condition we deduce : @xmath48 this allows one to evaluate the elastic and total cross - sections . by comparing them with data",
    "one can obtain information on the parameters of the model .    since the nuclear cross - sections are not sensitive to the exact shape of the impact parameter dependence of the constituent cross - sections ( as the nuclear radius is much larger than that of the nucleon ) , we parametrized @xmath49 using simple gaussian forms : @xmath50    the radii @xmath51 were constrained by the condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the quark or diquark s radius ( a natural constraint for the gaussians ) .    from ( [ pab ] )",
    "we deduce the total inelastic cross sections : @xmath54 and we also demand that the ratios of cross - sections satisfy the natural condition:@xmath55 expressing the idea that there are twice as many partons in the constituent diquark than those in the constituent quark .",
    "this allows to express @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 .    for the distribution of the constituents",
    "we again take a gaussian : @xmath59    the parameter @xmath60 has the physical meaning of the ratio of the quark and diquark masses and satisfies , @xmath61 ( the delta function guarantees that the center - of - mass of the system moves along the straight line ) .",
    "thus , finally , the model contains @xmath62 free parameters .    using this formulation and the formula ( [ tel ] )",
    "we have evaluated the elastic and total proton - proton cross - sections and adjusted the parameters by demanding that ( i ) total inelastic cross section ( ii ) slope of the elastic cross section ( iii ) position of the first diffractive minimum in elastic cross section and ( iv ) height of the second maximum in elastic scattering are in agreement with data .",

    "the most important observation is that both the ratio @xmath65 and the average number of wounded constituents in nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath14 seem almost entirely independent of the details of the model ( provided that , as explained above , the parameters are adjusted to describe correctly the proton - proton elastic data ) .",

    "@xmath91 @xmath92    one sees that , within the experimental accuracies a very good agreement both in shape and in absolute value is obtained .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) the concept of wounded nucleons and of wounded constituents is based on two ideas : ( a ) during the interaction , the  wounded  object acts as one unit and ( b ) particle emission process takes much longer time than it is needed for the projectile to pass the internuclear distance .",
    "these assumptions can be qualitatively justified only for _ soft _ collisions where the momentum transfer and transverse mass of the emitted partons are small enough .",
    "the first condition requires that the momentum transferred to the projectile is smaller than its inverse size . for the size of order of @xmath93 fm",
    ", this limits the momentum transfer to about @xmath76 mev .",
    "the second condition demands that the emission time : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the lorentz factor of the emitted particle ( parton ) in the rest frame of the target nucleus and @xmath96 is its rapidity in the same frame , should be significantly greater than the intranuclear distance . for @xmath97",
    "this limits the transverse mass of the emitted partons below @xmath76 mev .",
    "of course for the observed final hadrons this limit may be significantly higher .",
    "these estimates are , surely , rather crude . a more detailed verification of the model for particles with various masses and transverse momenta will be of great interest , as it may help to understand better the very concept of a wounded constituent .",
    "\\(ii ) as seen from these arguments , the model is not expected to apply in the fragmentation region of the projectile and target where , moreover , important energy - momentum conservation effects , as well as secondary interactions inside the nucleus must be present .",
    "therefore we focus our attention on the central rapidity region which , at rhic energies , is well separated from the fragmentation regions .",
    "\\(iii ) the model assumes that a wounded quark produces the same number of secondary partons as a wounded diquark .",
    "this is not unreasonable since the colour content of both constituents is the same ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) and that , probably , the colour charge of the projectile is the main factor determining the emission intensity .",
    "we admit , however , that since the actual dynamics of the soft production process is not yet understood , this argument can be questioned .",
    "the good agreement of the model with data , as presented in this paper , may thus serve as an ( indirect ) confirmation of the important role of colour dynamics in the process of particle production .",
    "\\(iv ) the predictions of the model described in this paper refer to the emission of  primary  partons and do not take into account further development of the system during its expansion and final formation of hadrons .",
    "the observed agreement with data indicates that the space - time development of the system , despite presence of the well - known collective effects , does not introduce drastic changes in its global characteristics .",
    "this may be considered as an argument in favour of the laminar hydrodynamic expansion suggested already by mc simulations of this process which seems to indicate very small viscosity of the created medium @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) we have verified that the main properties of the quark - diquark picture of the nucleon obtained from analysis of the pp elastic data are not sensitive to the details of the calculations ( several forms of the distribution of constituents and of their cross - sections were considered ) .",
    "the typical values of the parameters are @xmath100 fm , @xmath101 fm , @xmath102 fm , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "depends somewhat on the value of @xmath60 which is not very well determined . for @xmath60 not far from @xmath106 , @xmath107 . ]",
    "thus in our model the diquark appears to be rather large , comparable to the size of the proton .",
    "it is remarkable that this feature agrees well with other estimates @xcite , based on rather different arguments .",
    "\\(vi ) in this paper we have only discussed the symmetric au - au collisions . it would be also interesting to check the model for asymmetric collisions .",
    "we have verified that in case of d - au collisions at @xmath0 the formula ( [ start ] ) gives the result which does not differ very much ( less than @xmath108 % ) from that of the wounded nucleon model .",
    "thus the observed good agreement of the wounded nucleon model @xcite with the phobos data on d - au collisions @xcite is not destroyed in our approach .    in conclusion , we have formulated a model in which the soft collisions of the nucleon are described in terms of interactions of its two constituents : a quark and a diquark .",
    "the model can be adjusted to describe very precisely the elastic proton - proton scattering data .",
    "supplemented with the idea of wounded constituents , the model accounts rather well for the centrality dependence of particle production in the central rapidity region at rhic energies .",
    "we have greatly profited from discussion with wieslaw czyz to whom we also like to thank for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
