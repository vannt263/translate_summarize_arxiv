    "<S> the membrane always remains flat . beyond the outer parabola ( @xmath121 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the membrane no longer remains flat at any @xmath6 ( see text).,width=287 ]    furthermore from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ l_chieq ] ) , @xmath122 , yielding @xmath123 over a relevant range of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now the mean spontaneous curvature @xmath9 in the different regimes delineated by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath115 , a flat membrane ensues in the long wavelength limit , and @xmath124 ; see ap . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a statistically flat membrane in tl . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath125 , latexmath:[$\\langle c_0\\rangle = \\langle   ( { \\boldsymbol\\nabla}h)^2\\rangle\\chi/\\kappa_0=\\int_{2\\pi / l}^{\\lambda } \\frac{d^2q}{(2\\pi)^2 } q^2\\langle     @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the crumpling instability is generically associated with a diverging spontaneous curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> a finite surface tension @xmath127 , if present , will control the long wavelength fluctuations of the membrane  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath127 receives no relevant fluctuation corrections from the nonlinear terms @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( [ free energy_h ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly however , for a sufficiently large @xmath26 , @xmath128 that dominates at the intermediate wavevectors , may become negative , leading to finite wavevector instabilities , a feature testable in controlled _ in - vitro _ experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> although a full rbc  @xcite is clearly symmetric under inversion ( since the two lipid bilayers are identical in structure ) , each bilayer clearly has an asymmetric environment having the spectrin network only on one ( inner ) side of it . following the logic outlined above , </S>",
    "<S> our theory can be readily extended to two identical lipid membranes confining a spectrin network , that may serve as a minimal model for a whole rbc . </S>",
    "<S> using symmetry arguments as above , one can construct a coarse - grained free energy . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis similar to the one above indicates towards statistical flatness of rbc membranes for sufficiently low spectrin - lipid interaction strength , beyond which crumpling of the rbc should be observed . </S>",
    "<S> details will be considered elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies on live rbc membranes  @xcite reveal enhanced fluctuations in the rbc membranes for low frequencies . while a live rbc membrane is an _ active _ or driven system , and hence outside the scope of our theory , any consistent hydrodynamic theory for live rbc membranes should reduce to our theory in its equilibrium limit . </S>",
    "<S> our theory reveals the crumpling instability induced by strong enough asymmetry ( @xmath112 ) in a flat membrane . </S>",
    "<S> it must be generalized to study the nature of the thermodynamically stable structurally crumpled state ( @xmath112 ) . </S>",
    "<S> formal similarities between a direct generalization of our model to study the @xmath1-driven crumpling transition  @xcite and the standard landau theory for phase transitions with cubic nonlinearities open up the intriguing possibility of new universal scaling at the second order crumpling transition and also possibly first order crumpling transitions . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , how the structural crumpling elucidated here is connected to the well - known thermal crumpling of flat tethered membranes  @xcite still remains unresolved .    </S>",
    "<S> independent of the precise values of the model parameters ( which may yet be unknown experimentally ) , the general form and structure of the phase diagram ( [ k - chi ] ) can be tested in non living ( atp - depleted ) rbc membrane extract  @xcite , or for model asymmetric membranes by binding spectrin to lipids by presenting positive charges to lipid surfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the binding of the elastic network to the membrane surface may be controlled by proteins , e.g. , stomatin  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for other spectrin - lipid interactions . in </S>",
    "<S> laboratory - based controlled _ in - vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> experiments , the spectrin - lipid membrane interactions , modeled by @xmath24 here , may be controlled by adding cholesterol  @xcite in artificially prepared samples , or in atp - removed rbc membranes . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the analogous discrete models of asymmetric tethered membranes , similar to the studies in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , should be employed to verify our results .    </S>",
    "<S> our assumptions of a fixed distance between the elastic network and the attached lipid membrane is clearly an idealization ; for an rbc membrane @xmath129 is the average distance between the two  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> small fluctuations in @xmath14 about its mean , expected in atp - depleted rbc membranes , is not expected to modify our results in any significant manner ; see ap for details . </S>",
    "<S> self - avoidance , ignored here for a putative flat membrane , may be important in the unstable phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies on thin , spherical shells indicate that large enough shells can be crushed by thermal effects  @xcite . how the compressibility - mean curvature coupling introduced here affect this result </S>",
    "<S> may be investigated in future . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric nonlinearities associated with the monge gauge are irrelevant ( in a scaling / rg sense ) and hence have been neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we have used a planar geometry for simplicity . in other relevant geometries , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , spherical ( significant for an rbc membrane ) , there is a nonzero mean spontaneous curvature even without any fluctuation that characterizes the global shape of the membrane . whether an asymmetric ( i.e. , one - sided ) </S>",
    "<S> coupling of a spherical membrane with a spectrin network , described via an analog of the @xmath24-term in ( [ free energy ] ) , either _ increases _ or _ decreases _ the mean spontaneous curvature may now depend upon whether the spectrin layer is attached to the inner or outer surface of the spherical membrane . </S>",
    "<S> how that plays out in regard to the instabilities elucidated above is an important question that should be studied separately . </S>",
