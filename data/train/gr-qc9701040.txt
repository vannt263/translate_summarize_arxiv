    "in general relativity , inertial frames around rotating objects are dragged in the sense of the rotation .",
    "if the object is rotating rapidly , this dragging effect can be so strong that in some region no physical object can remain at rest relative to an inertial observer at spatial infinity .",
    "this region of spacetime is called an ergoregion or an ergosphere . for a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime , the ergosphere is the region in which the killing vector field @xmath0 that corresponds to time translations at spatial infinity fails to be timelike .",
    "the most common example of ergoregions would be the outside of the event horizon of any rotating black hole .",
    "ergoregions also arise in models of dense , rotating stars in which no event horizon exists inside the ergosurface @xcite .",
    "the question we want to answer in this paper is whether or not and how the presence of ergoregions only gives rise to quantum instability .    for massless field perturbations in rotating black holes",
    ", it has been shown that no unstable mode occurrs classically @xcite . however , quantum fields in this background spacetime where both horizon and ergoregion are present reveal vacuum instability , the so - called starobinskii - unruh effect , which is indeed the quantum counter part of the classical phenomena such as penrose process for particles and superradiance for waves @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , spacetimes with ergoregions but without horizons such as rapidly rotating stars are known to be unstable to scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations @xcite . as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , such classical instability , so - called ergoregion instability , can be understood heuristically by looking at a spherical wave packet in a ",
    "superradiant \" mode incident to the ergoregion . the reflected wave will be amplified and carry positive energy up to spatial infinity .",
    "the transmitted part within the ergoregion is also amplified but now carries negative energy with respect to an observer at infinity .",
    "this wave will pass through the center of the rotating object and get back to the ergosurface , again giving transmission as well as reflection there with energies amplified , repectively .",
    "this process will repeat as long as the ergoregion remains , resulting in presumably  exponential \" radiation of positive energy to infinity and accumulation of negative energy within the ergoregion in such a way that the total energy is conserved .",
    "it turns out that this instability is characterized by complex frequency modes in normal mode solutions of classical fields .",
    "the quantum counterpart of such ergoregion instability has been studied by ashtekar and magnon @xcite , and dray , kulkarni and manogue @xcite in algebraic approach , and by matacz , davies and ottewill in canonical approach @xcite of quantum fields .",
    "ashtekar and magnon have given a general argument in ref .",
    "@xcite that in a rotating spacetime with an ergoregion but without a horizon there does not exists a natural complex structure which gives no  mixing of positive and negative frequencies \" under time evolution , and hence no spontaneous creation of particles . in other words ,",

    "however , their algebraic approach is somewhat qualitative and it has not been shown what the detailed quantitative pictures of this quantum instability are . on the other hand , dray , kulkarni and manogue have claimed that there exists a natural complex structure if we quantize the system with respect to zamo observers @xcite rather than with respect to killing observers .    in the canonical quantization approach , matacz , davies and",
    "ottewill have recently investigated whether quantum vacuum instability occurrs near rapidly rotating stars .",
    "they have considered a simple spacetime model where the outside of a star is described by the kerr metric , and classical klein - gordon fields satisfy a mirror boundary condition ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) near the surface of the rotating star .",

    "consequently , complex frequency modes should exist in such a background spacetime .",
    "therefore , in order to conclude whether or not the quantum instability occurrs near stars with ergoregions , one must include such unstable complex frequency modes as well and needs to understand their physical roles in the quantization procedure .    after the discovery of the occurrence of complex frequency modes for a charged scalar field interacting with some strong electrostatic potential , the so - called schiff - snyder - weinberg effect @xcite",

    "we carry out , for the first time , this quantization procedure for a massless scalar field in a certain model of curved spacetime with an ergoregion but without a horizon .",
    "we find that it is possible to quantize the system , but mode operators for complex frequencies satisfy unusual commutation relations and do not admit a usual fock - like representation or a ground state as in other models in minkowski flat spacetime .",

    "therefore , an observer sitting outside the ergoregion will measure time dependent radiation of positive energy .",
    "in addition , since the energy spectrum is unbounded below , some external interaction with this system can give energy extraction from the system without bound .",
    "finally , we complete our quantization of the field @xmath2 by constructing the total hilbert space as follows , = h^r _ h^c_. here",
    "@xmath144 is the usual symmetrized fock space generated by real frequency modes and @xmath145 is the infinite number of products of hilbert spaces @xmath146 generated by complex frequency modes .",
    "in this section , let us look at some interesting properties of the hilbert space @xmath147 constructed in the previous section .",
    "first of all , one may ask whether or not this hilbert space still possesses the particle interpretation of the quantum field . for real frequency modes ,",
    "the energy spectrum is discrete and a vacuum state is defined well in the usual way . @xmath148 and @xmath149 can still be interpreted as creation and annihilation operators of energy quanta of @xmath150 , respectively . thus real frequency mode operators still have particle interpretation as usual except that the vacuum state defined is not the lowest energy state any more .    for complex frequency modes , however ,",
    "since the corresponding energy spectrum is continuous , it would not be possible to define some energy quanta whose multiples cover the whole energy spectrum .",
    "therefore mode operators associated with complex frequencies do not have particle interpretation in the usual sense .",
    "however , we may expect that there will be the energy quanta of @xmath151 since the spectrum of the rotation generator @xmath152 is discrete @xcite .",
    "now let us see how the appearance of an ergoregion at the late stage of a dynamically evolving background spacetime starts to give a spontaneous radiation of energy .",
    "we expect this spontaneous quantum radiation if the initial vacuum state @xmath153 of the field in the past falls in any state in @xmath145 in the remote future . to see this effect let us consider a  paticle\"detector linearly coupled to the field near @xmath154 placed in the in - vacuum state @xmath153 .",
    "the transition probability of the detector is proportioal to the response function @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "( e)=_t_0^t_0+t_t_0dt ^t_0+t_t_0dt e^-ie(t - t ) _ in < 0||0 > _ in .",
    "the field operator can also be decomposed as follows ( x ) = _ lmdk ( c_u_(x)+c^ _ u^ _ ) , where @xmath156 becomes spherical waves in the flat spacetime in the past infinity , and @xmath157 for all @xmath158 . since @xmath159\\phi [ x(t ' ) ]",

    "this result in general shows non - vanishing excitations of the particle detector related to complex frequency modes as well as the usual contributions due to the mode mixing in real frequency modes .",

    "for complex frequency modes , however , all modes contribute to the excitation possibly because the energy spectrum for any complex frequency mode is continuous .",
    "the first two terms will in general appear because the background spacetime is evolving in time and so it will effectively give time - dependent potential in eq .",
    "( [ kgr2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the case that there is no mixing in positive real frequency modes , they will vanish .",
    "the last term will vanish in the case that both @xmath167 and @xmath168 vanish for _ all _ @xmath106 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , we do not expect this case if there is any instability mode due to the presence of the ergoregion since otherwise the last equality in eq .",
    "( [ bogolc ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "in this paper , we have shown how the canonical quantization for a scalar field can be formulated in the presence of unstable modes due to ergoregion in a certain spacetime model .",
    "we found that our quantization has essentially the same features as in other models in minkowski flat spacetime in refs .",
    "the hamiltonian operator for complex frequency modes is equivalent to a system of a set of two coupled _ inverted _ harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus the energy spectrum is continuous and unbounded below .",
    "consequently , the corresponding hilbert space is not a fock - like representation and has no particle interpretation for such complex frequency mode operators .",
    "the  particle \" detector placed in the in - vacuum state shows that a rotating star with ergoregion but without horizon has the quantum instability as well , leading exponentially time dependent spontaneous energy radiation to spatial infinity .",
    "this quantum instability is possible because negative energy could be accumulated within the ergoregion .",
    "accordingly , our result resolves the contradiction between conclusions in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the spacetime model considered in this paper is physically plausible , it is not so realistic .",
    "thus one may ask whether the essential result obtained here would remain in a more realistic model . in the asymptotic region at spatial infinity , there would be no much difference in the analysis . near the rotating object and inside it",
    ", the forms of normal mode solutions will be quite different from ours .",
    "as long as an ergoregion is present , however , there will still be two classes of normal mode solutions , that is , one described by real frequencies and the other by complex frequencies .",
    "similar inner product properties shown in sec .  [ cf ] will still hold for this set of normal mode solutions since they do not depend on the details of the form of solutions .",
    "then the rest of the quantization procedure and the structure of the corresponding total hilbert space will be same .",
    "therefore , the main results in our model will remain in a more realistic spacetime model as well . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mirror boundary condition that we assumed to avoid the difficulty of obtaining complicated solutions inside the rotating body in fact mimics effectively the center of the star provided that the modes propagate freely through the interior without much interactions with the star body . in the limiting case",
    "that @xmath170 , our spacetime model in the future infinity becomes the rotating kerr black hole . in this case",
    "our results should agree with hawking s for the case of collapsing rotating black holes @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ imaginary ] ) , we see that the imaginary part of the complex frequency becomes zero as @xmath170 , and , accordingly , only real frequency modes @xmath171 appear in our model . however , it is as yet unclear whether or not this mode decomposition constructed here in the future infinity gives the same vacuum as hawking s @xcite",
    ".    it will be straightforward to extend our formalism to other matter fields such as massive charged scalar and electromagnetic fields .",
    "for spinor fields , however , it is unclear at the present whether or not rotating stars with ergoregions spontaneously radiate fermionic energy to infinity as well .",
    "it is because spinor fields do not give superradiance in the presence of an ergoregion .",
    "hence we can not apply the heuristic argument in sec .  [ in ] for the generation of instability modes .",
    "in fact , we find that the inner product defined in ref .  @xcite for spinor fields is still positive definite in our spcetime model . then , as explained below eq .",
    "( [ orthog ] ) , there exists no complex frequency mode and hence no unstable mode for spinor fields classically .",
    "however , as rotating black holes give fermion emissions in the quantum theory inspite of no superradiance at the classical level , there might be some quantum process through which the ergoregion gives fermionic spontaneous energy radiation .",
    "in addition , the main result obtained in the algebraic approach @xcite does not seem to depend on which matter field is considered .",
    "as shown in preceding sections , the hamiltonian operators associated with unstable modes do not admit a fock - like representation , a vacuum state , or the particle interpretation of mode operators .",
    "accordingly , the conventional analysis of the vacuum instability based on the uses of asymptotic vacua and appropriately defined number operators no longer applies to our case .",
    "however , we have shown that unruh s  particle \" detector model , which indeed does not require the particle interpretation of the field , is still applicable for extracting some usefull physics in our case .",
    "in fact , our case serves as a good example illustrating the point of view that the fundamental object in quantum field theory is the field operator itself , not the  particles \" defined in a preferred fock space @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator , which is defined by field operators only , should also be a useful quantity in our case . to obtain meaningful expectation value , however , renormalization of the energy - momentum tensor would have to be understood first in the presence of such instability modes @xcite . as far as we know",
    ", this interesting issue has never been addressed in the literature .      the penrose diagram for a realistic spacetime in which a stationary rotating star with an ergosphere develops in the remote future will be as in fig .",
    "[ ergofig1 ] .",
    "the solid line is the trajectory of the surface of a rotating object .",
    "the dotted lines denote the boundaries of the ergoregion .",
    "based on the analysis in our paper , exponentially time dependent spontaneous energy radiation will occur as soon as an ergoregion is formed",
    ". then the back reaction of the quantum field on the metric will change the gravitational fields of the evolving rotational object itself , depending on the strength and the time scale of the spontaneous radiation .",
    "since the wave trapped inside the ergoregion carries negative energy and the angular momentum in the opposite sense of the rotation , the rotating object will loose its angular momentum and so the ergoregion can disappear at some point of its evolution . then the spontaneous radiation will also stops to occur . the corresponding penrose diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ ergofig2 ]",
    ".      it will also be very interesting to see how our quantization procedure in this paper can be translated into algebraic approach . to obtain a quantum description in this approach",
    ", one defines first the @xmath172-algebra of the field operators and then constructs the hilbert space of states by choosing an appropriate @xmath172-representation ( equivalently , a suitable complex strucure ) with a set of rules for dynamics .",
    "the most difficult part in this prescription is to single out the  correct \" representation among all possible @xmath172-representations . for spacetimes such as static or stationary spacetimes @xcite ,",
    "certain physically motivated requirements select a unique complex structure and hence the  correct \" representation @xcite . for a spacetime where",
    "an ergoregion is present , on the other hand , ashtekar and magnon @xcite argue that there appears to exist no obvious way to choose even a specific complex structure since @xmath173 is not a cauchy surface in this case @xcite .",
    "however , the mode decomposition constructed in sec .",
    "[ cf ] and in sec .",
    "[ qi ] in our canonical quantization procedure suggests that there may exist some way to construct the corresponding complex structure in the algebraic approach as well .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that there are many other fields in physics in which complex frequency modes play important roles and so our quantization formalism is potentially applicable .",
    "generically , if a system stores some  free \" energy which can be released through interactions , then some amplifications occur , revealing complex frequency modes classically . in a system of plasma , for instance ,",
    "a small perturbation of electric field exponentially increases in time if the phase velocity of the perturbed field is smaller than the velocity of charged particles , and is damped in the opposite case .",
    "the energy stored in plasma is released quickly by a small perturbation , giving complex frequency modes@xcite . in a tunable laser ,",
    "the energy stored in dielectric material amplifies an incident light and results in the intensity increment of the output laser beam . in a field",
    "theoretic treatment of the system , the dielectric material plays the role of a source producing an external potential and it is possible for complex frequency modes to occur under suitable conditions . in the theory of linear quantum amplifiers@xcite , one assumes a time dependent annihilation operator , @xmath174 with a gain factor @xmath175 .",
    "this gain factor @xmath175 may be interpreted simply as coming from the imaginary part of a complex frequency mode in the second quantization scheme where one does not need to assume the non - unitary evolution of the mode operator .",
    "therefore , the quantization formalism described at the present work may be useful to understand those phenomena in the context of quantum field theory .",
