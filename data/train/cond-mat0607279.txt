    "classical nematics possess long range orientational order as a result of anisotropically biased pair interaction between their long rod - like molecules . below a certain temperature",
    "such systems are in the ordered phase , where the rods are on average aligned with their long axes parallel to each other .",
    "macroscopically this preferred direction is defined by a unit vector called the director , labelled as @xmath8 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects a quenched random field ",
    "disorder coupled to the local order parameter  has on the ordering of @xmath6 nematics .",
    "this is a special sub - class of systems where the orientational ordering direction is confined to a plane ( hence the name @xmath6 ) , while the overall system dimensionality may remain the usual @xmath9 ( or any other ) .",
    "this is of course fully analogous to the famous @xmath6 magnets @xcite , but with the quadrupolar ( nematic ) order rather than a dipolar",
    ". physically such systems are increasingly common in thin planar cells of a liquid crystal , or in new liquid crystalline elastomers made into thin free standing films with the director confined in their plane .",
    "the presence of quenched disorder is implicit in many systems , as different as random ferromagnets @xcite , vortex latices in type-@xmath10 superconductors @xcite and randomly crosslinked nematic elastomers @xcite .",
    "it arises from impurities whose distribution in the sample and the constraints they impose on the local field conformation do not change on the time scale relevant for the evolution of the main ordering .",
    "the influence of quenched disorder is well understood from a theoretical point of view . in the limit of weak disorder ,",
    "it was first shown by larkin that impurities lead to the destruction of long range order @xcite .",
    "this result was then generalized by imry and ma who demonstrated that , in less than four dimensions , an arbitrarily weak random field confines the long range order to hold only at length scales smaller than the  domain size \" @xmath11 .",
    "the system breaks into uncorrelated regions and therefore loses overall order and alignment @xcite .",
    "much work has been done on @xmath6 random anisotropy magnets , showing magnetization correlations to decay exponentially @xcite : @xmath12 .",
    "more sophisticated analysis was done on flux lattices with a two component order parameter ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) whose hamiltonian incorporates an elastic term and a random potential @xcite .",
    "it shows that correlations in fact decay as a power - law @xmath15 , giving rise to quasi - long range order ( qlro ) .",
    "a functional renormalization group analysis gives a similar behavior for @xmath6 ferromagnets , but also finds that quasi - long range order is absent in the case of a magnetization field with more than three components @xcite .",
    "our work follows a similar line to ref  @xcite and also predicts qlro .",
    "however , another non - pertubative functional renormalization group analysis disputes the presence of qlro in @xmath13 @xmath14 , where the system is found to always stay disordered @xcite .",
    "the authors find that for @xmath13 the critical dimensionality below which qlro exists to be @xmath16 .",
    "in many systems with such glassy nature of macroscopic ordering , the experimental observation of key theoretical predictions is difficult and often indirect .",
    "the loss of the long range orientational order is directly seen in equilibrium polydomain nematic elastomers .",
    "these materials , formed by crosslinking liquid crystalline polymers in their isotropic phase , have inherent quenched disorder .",
    "there are two plausible explanations why disorder is present , related to each other .",
    "residual heterogeneous strains established at the moment of crosslinking give rise to random stresses ( a ) , acting locally on the nematic order @xcite . alternatively",
    "( b ) , the locally anisotropic crosslinks provide randomly oriented anisotropy axes whose disordering effect competes with frank elasticity , which favors a uniform director configuration @xcite .",
    "there is also a model essentially treating an ad hoc random temperature in a nematic system @xcite but its approach , neglecting the fundamental couplings of nematic ordering to the underlying elastic network is not relevant for our work .",
    "it may be possible that a careful analysis of director correlations could resolve the physical origin of quenched disorder due to the network crosslinks , since computer simulations based on model ( a ) predict a faster than exponential decay of director correlations @xcite , whereas simulations based on model ( b ) find the decay to be exponential @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in both simulations the disorder correlation length has been a rapidly decreasing function of the effective disorder strength .",
    "the dependance is exponential and therefore poses the problem that the correlation length does not diverge at the limit of vanishing disorder .    in practice ,",
    "the polydomain nematic elastomers have the following features . on cooling below the nematic - to - isotropic transition temperature ( @xmath17 ) a high order parameter phase is formed .",
    "measurement of the order parameter is difficult , with perhaps only nmr a suitable technique @xcite .",
    "there are differing reports in the literature over the years , in all cases finding the transition to be continuous  approaching a critical point in better quality samples .",
    "it is well established that deep in the nematic phase the orientation of the nematic director is very non - uniform : @xmath8 varies continuously across the sample , pointing roughly along one direction across a very small region of space : following a classical spin - glass pattern which is perhaps misleadingly called a  polydomain \" structure .",
    "correlations between director orientations at different points in space decay rapidly and eventually vanish at distances much larger than @xmath11 so that long range order is eventually lost @xcite .",
    "this characteristic length scale @xmath11 , is often called the domain size or correlation length .",
    "it is well established to be of the order of microns @xcite in many different systems .",
    "therefore , light passing through such a sample is strongly scattered on birefringent regions with randomly oriented optical axis . as a result , such a sample is completely transparent at high temperatures , but becomes opaque below @xmath17 due to the multiple scattering of the disordered nematic phase .",
    "the dependence of @xmath11 on the magnitude of the order parameter ( @xmath1 ) and the effective strength of quenched disorder ( @xmath2 ) is the main focus this work .",
    "the experimental work quoted above was done in thin films leading us to consider directors that are confined to the @xmath18-plane , though being dependent an all three spatial coordinates .",
    "this choice would also adequately describe nematic membranes @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath19 we summarize a physical model of quenched disorder in nematic systems following @xcite .",
    "section  @xmath20 applies the gaussian variational method @xcite to this problem .",
    "we find that the replica symmetry is broken in this system and most of the calculations are performed within the hierarchical replica symmetry breaking framework . in section",
    "@xmath21 we solve the variational equations and then obtain @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also examine how the phase transition is changed by presenting a predicted @xmath22 plot . finally , in section  @xmath23 , we conclude by discussing our results and comparing them with experiments .",
    "in nematic elastomers crosslinked in the isotropic phase the network crosslinks act as sources of quenched orientational disorder . the crosslinks always contain anisotropic groups that provide easy anisotropy axes @xmath24 , similar to the sources in random anisotropy magnets @xcite .",
    "we assume it is favorable for the local director to align along @xmath24 in the vicinity of the crosslink .",
    "the orientation of the anisotropy axes as well as the spacial distribution of the crosslinks are quenched variables .",
    "they remain unaltered with time even if external conditions , such as temperature , change .",
    "we follow previous work @xcite modeling the local coupling between the nematic order and the random field . for a crosslink positioned at @xmath25 with anisotropy axis @xmath26 a free energy  @xmath27",
    "is attributed to it , where @xmath28 is the coupling strength and @xmath29 is the @xmath6 nematic tensor order parameter at spatial position @xmath30 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath1 of the nematic order parameter is different from the edwards - anderson order parameter of spin glasses , but serves the purpose : @xmath31 refers to a completely ordered state whereas @xmath32 to a disordered one @xcite . employing a continuum density of impurities @xmath33 and substituting the full expression of @xmath34",
    "we get the coarse - grained form of random field energy for the whole sample : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total number of impurities ( crosslinks ) .",
    "the positive linear term ( @xmath37 ) is a byproduct of the requirement that @xmath34 is traceless .",
    "it cancels out when random disorder is treated properly in subsection  [ replicasection ] , and it is dropped for now .",

    "both the microscopic and the phenomenological landau - degennes theories of nematic transition give the elastic constant @xmath41 to scale as @xmath42 for @xmath43 . combining these two estimates , we take that for small @xmath1 the elastic constant is approximated by @xmath44 . finally , it is noted that the local magnitude of the order parameter is taken to be constant across the sample and @xmath45 , that is , the effect of quenched disorder lies in the resulting equilibrium director texture . it is assumed that the sample is chemically homogeneous and boundary effects are neglected .",
    "this hamiltonian has been shown @xcite to explain domain formation in nematic elastomers using the classic imry - ma argument @xcite .",
    "even weak random field destroys long range order in length scales greater than the correlation length @xmath46 , where in our notation @xmath47 is the number of crosslinks per unit volume .",
    "it is a well known fact that the correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations should diverge close to the phase transition . in direct contrast ,",
    "when the imry - ma argument is applied to nematic elastomers the disorder correlation length tends to zero as the order parameter vanishes ( @xmath48 ) because @xmath41 is a quadratic functions of @xmath1 . in section  [ resultssection ]",
    "we are able to clarify this rare shortcoming of the imry - ma argument .",
    "we are interested in results averaged over the random distributions of the quenched variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 because these variables can not be controlled experimentally . in other words ,",
    "one looks for the macroscopic averages over a variety of realizations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "crosslinking the sample above @xmath17 makes the easy anisotropy axes point at random directions in the @xmath6 plane , with an isotropic probability of orientation @xmath51 .",

    "such nematic configuration occurs in many experimental arrangements where thin films are used and is especially relevant for nematic elastomers",
    ". quenched impurities ( chemical crosslinks in the case of elastomers ) act as sources of disorder by providing easy anisotropy axes .",
    "the competition between frank elasticity and these random sources leads to the loss of long range orientational order : the mesogenic units ( rod - like molecules ) are assumed to be locally well - ordered with the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath1 uniform throughout the system , but the orientation of the director varies on a length scale @xmath11 , called the domain size .",
    "we have extracted the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a measure of the strength of disorder .",

    "the functional forms of @xmath168 and @xmath200 adequately describe the evolution of the domain size , reported by experiment and simulations .",
    "in particular , @xmath211 provides a consistent account of the divergence of @xmath11 as the phase transition is approached . for @xmath212 , where the exponential function varies much more smoothly , the imry - ma estimate @xmath213 is recovered . when disorder is not strong , we found the domain size to diverge as @xmath214 .",
    "this form combines the exponential decay found in some simulations with the classic imry - ma result .",
    "it is possible that this behavior can be verified experimentally by measuring @xmath11 for nematic elastomers with different crosslink density",

    "the parameter @xmath98 that models the random field within the gvm is identically zero as @xmath1 approaches zero .",
