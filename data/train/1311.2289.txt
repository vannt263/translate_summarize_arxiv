    "in this paper , we study nuclear medium effects on the electromagnetic @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3 )  @xcite and weak @xmath4(@xmath2,@xmath3 ) and @xmath5(@xmath2,@xmath3 )  @xcite structure functions , in some nuclear targets .",
    "we use a relativistic nuclear spectral function  @xcite to describe the momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus and define everything within a field theoretical approach where , nucleon propagators are written in terms of this spectral function . the spectral function has been calculated using the lehmann s representation for the relativistic nucleon propagator and nuclear many body theory is used for calculating it for an interacting fermi sea in nuclear matter . local density approximation",
    "is then applied to translate these results to finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we have assumed the callan - gross relationship for nuclear structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the contributions of the pion and rho meson clouds are taken into account in a many body field theoretical approach which is based on refs .",
    "we have taken into account target mass correction following ref .",
    "@xcite which has significant effect at low @xmath3 , moderate and high bjorken @xmath2 . for the shadowing effect which is important at low @xmath3 and low x , and modulates the contribution of pion and rho cloud contributions , we have followed the works of kulagin and petti  @xcite .",
    "we have compared the numerical results for the case of electromagnetic structure function @xmath8 , with jlab  @xcite and slac  @xcite data .",
    "we have also presented these ratios for weak structure functions i.e. @xmath9 ( i=2,3 ) .",
    "the expression for the electromagnetic nuclear structure function @xmath10 for an isoscalar nuclear target is written as  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the free nucleon structure function expressed in terms of nucleon parton distribution functions(pdfs ) , @xmath13 is the hole spectral function taken from the works of ref.@xcite , @xmath14    the expressions for weak nuclear structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 for nonisoscalar nuclear target are written as  @xcite : @xmath17 \\frac{x}{x_n } \\left(1+\\frac{2x_n",

    "we have considered separate distributions of fermi sea for protons and neutrons . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two different spectral functions , each one of them is normalized to the number of protons or neutrons in the nuclear target .",
    "the deuteron structure functions have been calculated using the same formulae as in eq.[f2a_kulagin ] but performing the convolution with the deuteron wave function  @xcite squared instead of the spectral function .",
    "numerical results obtained by incorporating medium effects like fermi motion , pauli blocking , nuclear binding , and nucleon correlations , we call the results as base results .",
    "results obtained by also including meson cloud contributions and shadowing and antishadowing effects to the base calculation are named as results with the full model calculation . in fig.[figem ] , we present the results for the ratio of the electromagnetic nuclear structure funtion to the deuteron structure function .",
    "we observe that the results are in fair agreement with the jlab  @xcite and slac  @xcite data . in fig.[f2f3carbon ] , we have presented the numerical results for weak structure functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 in carbon nuclear target at different values of x and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the base result decreases to 4 - 6@xmath25 from the free case(no medium effects in it ) at low - x . at higher values of x difference between the base and free results",
    "when the meson cloud contribution is included along with the nucleon spectral function , we see that results change by about 15 - 17@xmath25 at x=0.08 and modified by 5 - 6@xmath25 at x=0.35 , and the difference becomes insignificant at high - x . moreover , we observe that the difference between the results with full model calculation and the results without shadowing and antishadowing effect is about 3 - 4@xmath25 at low - x and low-@xmath3 which vanishes at high - x . also , we find that the results obtained at nlo with full model calculation reduce by about 3 - 9@xmath25 in studied region of @xmath3 at x=0.08 from the lo results , and with the increase in x this difference between lo and nlo results , becomes small , like 3 - 5@xmath25 for mid values of x. while at higher values of x the results at nlo with full calculation reduce by about 14 - 24@xmath25 from the base results at nlo .",
