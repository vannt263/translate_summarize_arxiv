    "with the discovery of the first extrasolar planet ( ep ) orbiting a solar - like star @xcite a new field of astronomical research started .",
    "so far , more than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered . despite severe observational biases -only partially overcome by the development of more sophisticated techniques and facilities-",
    "the most striking fact is the vast variety of eps , and the remarkable difference with respect to the planets of our solar system .",
    "traditional theories of planetary formation have been seriously challenged by these discoveries , and there are many aspects that still need to be understood in detail , like planetary migrations ( disk - embedded vs planet - planet interactions ) and the influence of the metallicy on the planetary formation processes , just to mention some .",
    "the heterogeneity of eps has been analyzed in several papers , and some important trends have been uncovered ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , planetary formation is a very complex process , where a number of parameters have important effects , as shown by several theoretical works .",
    "it is also likely that some parameters act simultaneously in a complex way , thus motivating the need for a multidimensional approach going beyond the search for simple correlations among individual parameters .",
    "in other words , the planetary formation process occurs in a multidimensional space .",
    "in addition to keplerian orbital elements and stellar properties , other relevant parameters may be discovered in the future , as the formation theories improve .",
    "+ we adopt a multivariate approach to eps in order to uncover underlying trends which may provide important information about the planet formation processes .",
    "the first step is the development of a robust taxonomy for eps .",
    "taxonomy , just as in other fields of research , may be a precious tool in defining clusters of eps , which in turn may highlight differences in the formation processes and subsequent evolution .",
    "+ this will be of particular importance with the increasing number of ep discoveries which is expected to occur in the near future thanks to several space missions ( e.g. corot and kepler ) and ground  based surveys . for the moment ,",
    "the number of eps is about 200 , which may prevent firm statistical conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , here we propose the guidelines for an ep taxonomy , to be refined as more data become available . + in the next section ( 2 ) , we describe the parameters used for this study and we perform a statistical approach of the data for dimensional scaling purpose .",
    "then , in section ( 3 ) , cluster analysis is performed .",
    "we caution from the beginning that these analyses -much like all statistical analyses- are not unique , since several different criteria may be used for characterizing the data .",
    "there is no a priory best criterion : the choice can indeed vary according to the kind of data under analysis .",
    "we shall provide a step - by - step justification for all the choices made .",
    "finally , in section ( 4 ) , the solution will be discussed along with its physical interpretation .",
    "the inputs to our model are the elements provided by the interactive extrasolar planets catalog mantained by j. schneider .",
    "these are : planetary projected mass ( @xmath0 ) , orbital period ( @xmath1 ) , semi - major axis ( @xmath2 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath3 ) , inclination ( @xmath4 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath5 ) , and stellar metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "other possibly important parameters , like stellar spectral type and stellar age , have not been considered at this stage , but will be the subject of further refinements . only objects having simultaneously estimates for \\{@xmath6,[fe / h ] } have been used . notice that the period and semi - major axis are obviously correlated , thus only one of them is used ( see the following ) .",
    "we refer to them as the _ input variables _ and @xmath2 instead of performing some transformation of the data prior to the statistical analysis , as done by some authors which made recourse to logarithms , because there is no strong physical reason for that .",
    "anyway , we plan to exploit this possibility in further works . ] .",
    "therefore , each planet can be regarded as a point in a 5-fold space .",
    "the following analysis has been carried out in the idl language , and it is structured so as to be easily updatable as more data become available . + we consider 183 eps ( updated at 8 november 2006 ) . to them , the solar system planet jupiter has been added .",
    "this has been done because jupiter - like bodies are approaching the observability limit in extrasolar planetary systems thanks to recent improvement in the surveys , and also to have a direct comparison with our own solar system .",
    "we decided not to add the other solar system planets as they are still well below the detection limits .",
    "the first step is to perform a statistical analysis in order to find out if there are useless -or less significant- input variables .",
    "this is done using principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "as this is a standard technique in multivariate data analysis , details will not be discussed here ( interested readers may consult * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the basic idea of pca is to combine the input variables in such a way as to show those of most importance",
    "this is done by describing the data with a number of new variables @xmath7 for @xmath8 , ordered in terms of decreasing variance .",
    "the @xmath9 are chosen in such a way as to be uncorrelated with each other .",
    "this is done in practice by building an @xmath10 input data matrix ( where @xmath11 is the number of planets ) . from this matrix , the @xmath12 correlation or covariance matrix",
    "is computed , where the correlation matrix is more appropriate whenever the input variables are measured with disparate units .",
    "the @xmath9 are eigenvectors for those matrices . considering that input variables have different units and that some span orders of magnitudes ( e.g. @xmath0 ) while others span a limited range ( e.g. @xmath5 ) , we opted to perform variable standardization of the input variables , i.e. to scale input variables in such a way as to obtain a mean and variance of 1 .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing the use of the covariance matrix , for which the eigenvalues ( @xmath13 ) represent the portion of the variance of the original data which the corresponding eigenvectors ( @xmath9 ) account for .",
    "pca can thus provide a useful means for finding variables of little significance . on the basis of the variance attained by each @xmath9 we may reject some of them .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of using only the variables which are important , allowing a simpler description of the data set with only a minor loss of information",
    ". + as a first step , we used pca to decide whether the period or the semi - major axis is more suitable for the statistical analysis ( see also  3.2 on this point ) .",
    "pca was then performed on the \\{@xmath14[fe / h ] } and \\{@xmath15[fe / h ] } spaces .",
    "the choice was made by requiring that the variance of the resulting @xmath9 is more concentrated in the first principal components .",
    "the 5-fold \\{@xmath16}$ ] } space turned out to be slightly more appropriate .",
    "now , no commonly accepted rules exist for deciding which variables -if any- can be safely thrown away .",
    "one criterion suggests keeping variables which account for 70 - 90% of the total variance @xcite .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to keep only the first three principal components which account for 73% of the total variance .",
    "the fact that we can use only 3 principal components allows a graphical representation and a better control of the results .",
    "moreover , dimensional scaling has the effect of simplifying the clustering analysis .",
    "this is why we employed pca , but we are aware it is not strictly necessary for the development of a taxonomy . in fig .",
    "[ pca3d ] the first three principal components are shown .",
    "+ to the accepted levels of variance we may write the following _ decomposition _ formulae :    @xmath17 - 0.1})\\\\ pc_2 & = & -0.083\\cdot ( m_p-2.64)-0.030\\cdot ( a-1.19)-\\nonumber\\\\   & & 0.335\\cdot ( e-0.25)+3.080\\cdot ( m_s-1.03)+\\\\   & & 3.921\\cdot({\\rm [ fe / h]-0.1})\\\\ pc_3 & = & 0.090\\cdot ( m_p-2.64)-0.329\\cdot ( a-1.19)+\\nonumber\\\\    & & 1.795\\cdot ( e-0.25)-1.748\\cdot ( m_s-1.03)+\\\\    & & 2.063\\cdot({\\rm [ fe / h]-0.1})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where each @xmath9 is expressed in terms of a linear combination of all the input variables . notice that [ fe / h ] has little influence on @xmath18 , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 basically do not contribute to @xmath19 ( consider that input variables span different ranges , so for instance , the term containing @xmath3 in equ .",
    "2 has lower importance than the term involving @xmath0 ) .",
    "these formulae may be used to add new planets into the database , without repeating the pca ( this is useful when we want to add only single objects which do not alter the overall statistics , otherwise pca has to be repeated ) . + finally notice that we also checked for the presence of overall correlations within the database .",
    "we found significant correlation ( see also below ) between @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , overall correlations have been widely analyzed elsewere and will be not discussed here ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "cluster analysis is a standard technique used in a variety of research fields from social sciences to geology , engineering and so on .",
    "the main purpose of such analysis is to find clusters in a given dataset such that elements belonging to the same cluster have a certain degree of homogeneity , while elements of different clusters have to be as different as possible . as with pca",
    ", there is no unique way of performing the analysis and a number of clustering algorithms are available .",
    "the choice of the clustering technique is quite arbitrary and it relies mostly on the kind of description of the data we are interested in . when the number of clusters is not known a priory , as in our case , hierarchical clustering is more suitable , thus we adopt this technique @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of this technique is that it provides a classification which consists of a series of nested partitions , which go from a single cluster containing all objects to @xmath11 clusters each containing a single object .",
    "this process is based on a _",
    "parameter , usually a measure of distance among objects .",
    "moreover , this classification may be represented by a two - dimensional diagram known as a _ dendrogram _ , which illustrates the nested nature of the hierarchical partition .",
    "however , there are a number of possible ways to perform the analysis , and an accurate step - by - step evaluation of the process has to be performed . in the following we refer to the variables used for the clustering ( namely the \\{@xmath9 } ) as _ clustering variables_. the general guidelines for hierarchical cluster analysis are the following ( for more details",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * standardization of the clustering variables ; * computation of the proximity matrix , that is , evaluate the degree of proximity among dataset members .",
    "this is usually done by computing the distance in the clustering space ( in our case the 3-fold @xmath23 space ) .",
    "notice that several metrics may be used for this purpose ; * definition of inter - group proximity measures .",
    "these specify the method used to quantify the proximity level of two clusters .",
    "several methods are available , like _",
    "single linkage _ and _ centroid linkage _ ; * computation of the distortion of the dendrogram .",
    "the dendrogram itself is a representation of the original data , where the separation of two members is specified by the minimum distance between the two clusters which contain the objects .",
    "thus the quality of a dendrogram can be evaluated by comparing the original distance ( i.e. in the clustering space ) of members with the distance assigned to them by the dendrogram .",
    "this is formally done by the so - called _ cophenetic coefficient _ proceed as follows .",
    "first , compute the distance between two planets ( indicated by indices @xmath4 and @xmath24 ) assigned by the dendrogram .",
    "let @xmath25 be this distance , and @xmath26 the average value of all @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the real distance between planet @xmath4 and @xmath24 , and @xmath28 the average value of all @xmath27 .",
    "thus : @xmath29^{1/2 } } \\ ] ] ] ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it normally ranges from 0.6 to 0.95 , where higher values correspond to a lower distortion ; * definition of the best partition . in standard analysis",
    "this means stopping the hierarchy at a given distance ; in other words to cut a dendrogram at a particular distance ( or _ height _ , @xmath31 ) .",
    "again , no unique rule exists to define the best cut . here",
    "we follow the procedure suggested by @xcite , the so - called _ upper tail rule_. in detail , we first evaluate the distribution of the heights @xmath32 , then the best cut height is determined by + @xmath33 + where @xmath34 is a coefficient which ranges from 1.25 to 3.5 @xcite , @xmath35 is the mean of the height distribution and @xmath36 its standard deviation .",
    "a possible way to define the best @xmath34 is to find the values of @xmath34 for which the maximum separation between two consecutive solutions is achieved ;",
    "* testing of the quality of the solution against the absence of clusters .",
    "first we decided not to standardize the clustering variables as this may reduce the difference among members , making the identification of clusters more difficult .",
    "moreover , as a general rule , the same metrics should be used for the proximity matrix and the inter - group proximity measures .",
    "we explored different metrics and the effects of different algorithms of inter - group merging .",
    "the metrics used are : euclidean , city block , chebyshev , and correlative ( based on the pearson correlation coefficient ) .",
    "the inter - group algorithms considered are : single linkage , complete linkage , weighted pairwise average and weighted centroid .",
    "the full set of possibilities has been investigated by using the cophenetic coefficient and analyzing the corresponding dendrograms .",
    "@xmath30 ranged from about 0.55 to 0.84 .",
    "although useful , the cophenetic coefficient can not be the only parameter for finding the best solution ; very different hierarchies may have the same @xmath30 . here",
    ", we also considered other features in order to define the best solution . among them , we first select the dendrograms having @xmath32 distributions with the lowest variance , i.e. those more peaked for low heights .",
    "then , we required the tails of the @xmath32 distributions have to be very `` discrete '' for large heights , that is the solutions with @xmath37 and @xmath38 clusters ( for low values of @xmath37 ) had to be well separated .",
    "both conditions help to define a robust solution which is closely nested for small heights and stable against errors ( e.g. observational errors ) on the position of the eps in the clustering space .",
    "+ taking into account these constraints , the best solution was obtained with the pearson correlation distance is defined as @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath40 is the pearson correlation coefficient . ] and weighted centroid merging .",
    "this solution corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "according to the upper tail rules , the best cut produces five robust clusters .",
    "remarkably , the interval of heights for which the solution is stable corresponds to 7% of the maximum height ( notice that the average separation between two consecutive clusters is of the order of the maximum height divided by @xmath11 , or @xmath42 ) .",
    "the corresponding best solution dendrogram is shown in figure [ dendro ] .",
    "the dendrogram is well structured : for low heights the clusters are closely nested ( i.e. small variation of the height results in a significant change in the number of clusters ) ; while for higher values the clusters are well separated . + it is interesting to note that traditional metrics ( like the euclidean ) and traditional cluster merging ( like single linkage ) produce , in general , bad results .",
    "it turns out that they are not able to find structures for eps .",
    "this is in agreement with the analysis of @xcite , although it was performed with a very different approach to that adopted here .",
    "the main problem of these hierarchies is that either they produce just one or two big clusters and some outliers , or the solution is so nested that the definition of cut - off is too arbitrary and meaningless .      before analyzing in detail the best solution found",
    ", we have to check for its robustness against the absence of clusters .",
    "we recall that cluster analysis will always produce a solution .",
    "the test for the absence of structure is done by an accurate evaluation of the intra - cluster separations . in general , unless we are dealing with data with very well separated clusters , the clusters will tend to have some degree of overlap .",
    "the overlap between two clusters can be estimated by comparing the distance of two clusters with respect to their volume in the clustering space . in practice , we estimate the center of each cluster ( @xmath43 ) , and its radius ( @xmath44 ) , defined as the sphere which contains a given percentage of the cluster members ( both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are computed with a euclidean metric ) .",
    "thus the degree of overlap between clusters @xmath4 and @xmath24 is set to : @xmath45 . where for @xmath46 the clusters @xmath47 are well separated .",
    "the overall overlap of the solution is defined as :    @xmath48    higher values of @xmath49 imply larger overlap .",
    "notice that @xmath49 is a cumulative parameter and is sensitive to the number of single intra - cluster overlaps , as it should be . to clarify this point , imagine a solution with a given degree of overlap between two clusters , and another one with the same degree of overlap but among three clusters .",
    "the average degree of overlap will be the same , but the @xmath49 of the second solution will be higher than that of the first . indeed the first solution is better than the second since only two clusters are partially merged . for the best solution , we obtained @xmath50 .",
    "one way of testing the absence of clusters is with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we then performed a number of simulations ( with @xmath51 solutions each ) , generating @xmath11 random points in the clustering space .",
    "the points are generated with a uniform distribution along each axis .",
    "then we run the clustering analysis using the same procedure described before , varying also the volume of the monte carlo generated points in the clustering space , and the percentage of objects used for defining the cluster s radii .",
    "the probability of obtaining @xmath52 is less then 10% in all cases .",
    "thus we may safely reject the possibility of the absence of structures .",
    "for the shake of completeness , we also perform additional tests to see whether our initial choice of using @xmath2 instead of @xmath1 is indeed a good choice in terms of taxonomy . performing clustering analysis using @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 ,",
    "we obtain a solution which has @xmath53 and is compatible with the absence of structures",
    ". a possible explanation of this behavior could be due to the fact that @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 are related .",
    "as a result , the use of the pair @xmath54 is better than the pair @xmath55 .",
    "this further strengthens the case for the use of the semi - major axis .",
    "+ moreover , we also tested the solution with respect to the presence of observational errors , which can be very large in some cases . to do this",
    ", we generated a random error in the input variables around the nominal values for all the eps .",
    "we then repeated the pca and cluster analysis of these fictitius samples ( one for each of the input variables ) .",
    "the solution obtained has been compared with the best solution . for errors of a few percent",
    ", we find that some planets may move to other clusters , but this is limited to a few objects .",
    "increasing the errors , sometimes a cluster may split into two sub - clusters . for errors larger than 10%",
    "the solution may alter considerably .",
    "in general the best solution does not change much for errors up to @xmath56 for each of the input variables .",
    "this is very important , since it means that the solution is quite stable , in particular considering that we are dealing with projected planetary masses and not real masses .",
    "+ the process developed for ep taxonomy is sketched in fig .",
    "[ guide ] .",
    "our best solution is composed of five robust clusters . in this section we present the properties of each cluster . figure [ pca_projected ] shows the position of clusters in the clustering space .",
    "we checked for inter - correlation among the input variables within each cluster .",
    "it is commonly accepted that planets may form in different ways ( core accretion vs disk instability ) , and that their evolution is affected by several parameters ( disk density , stellar types , opacity etc ) .",
    "the ep database may reflect such complexity , however the signature of these processes may be blurred in statistical analyses which deal with the whole ep dataset . on the contrary , if cluster separation has something to do with the formation and evolutionary processes and is not just a mere classification , it becomes important to look for trends within each cluster . in the following we report",

    "indeed they are not correlated to the level of confidence adopted here .",
    "moreover , the members of this cluster have very super - solar metallicities . these correlations , if related to the formation processes , may give important indications about the origin of high eccentricities .",
    "many theories have been proposed @xcite but none has observational support yet .",
    "here we suggest that the metallicity acts in some way in determining @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , since high [ fe / h ] produces a faster migration , the low values of @xmath3 observed for high [ fe / h ] may be the result of the migration process , e.g. tidal circularitazion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternatively the condition for the pumping up of @xmath3 during planet - disk interactions @xcite is not achieved in high [ fe / h ] environments : indeed higher [ fe / h ] implies higher disk viscosity and hence a lower probability of @xmath3 excitation ( see equ . 8 and 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "if confirmed , these trends suggest that planetary orbital parameters are mainly controlled by disk properties ( e.g. metallicity ) rather than being affected by _ external _ factors , like perturbation due to interactions with a companion star or star encounters .",
    "+ finally , @xmath5 is anti - correlated with [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is not easy to understand this correlation , and in particular if it has something to do with the planetary formation process .",
    "we note that eps in this cluster ( which are quite confined in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) orbit stars whose metallicities tend to increase as stellar masses decrease . if we assume that higher @xmath5 implies higher proto - planetary disks masses from which eps formed , this implies that to form planets in lower metallicity environments a more massive disk is required , in agreement with the core accretion theory .",
    "+ eleven eps are in msss ( see table [ tab_sup ] ) .",
    "it contains also 23 hot jupiters ( 48% of the members ) and 8 mps planets .",
    "they are well spread and seem not to affect the @xmath73[fe / h ] , @xmath81[fe / h ] correlations .",
    "however , all mps planets and most of the hot jupiters lie above the linear fit in the @xmath82[fe / h ] plane .",
    "notice also the mps planets of this cluster have @xmath83 and [ fe / h]@xmath84 and for this reason they differ from those of @xmath61_2 _ ( which have @xmath85 , [ fe / h]@xmath86 ) and those of @xmath57_4 _ ( which have @xmath87 ) .",
    "this cluster contains 48 eps ( see tables [ tab ] and [ tab_sup ] ) .",
    "the prototype is hd  142022  a  b. @xmath57_4 _ is characterized by rather flat distributions of the input variables ( see fig .",
    "[ c_comparison ] ) . in terms of planetary masses",
    ", it contains very massive bodies , basically all having @xmath88 .",
    "apart from very few exceptions , it contains all the eps of the dataset having mass greater than @xmath89 .",
    "the average and standard deviations are 5.45 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution is also quite flat , ranging from about 0.5 to 5  au .",
    "mean and standard deviations are 1.98 and 1.27  au , respectively .",
    "eccentricities are remarkably moderate - to - high , spanning from 0.3 to 0.8 ( mean and standard deviation are 0.49 and 0.18 , respectively ) .",
    "stellar masses are mainly around one solar mass , with a slight overabundance of super - solar mass objects . mean and standard deviations are 1.06 and @xmath91 , respectively",
    "metallicities span from -0.25 to 0.3  dex , having an average and standard deviations of 0.14 and 0.17  dex , respectively .",
    "thus despite its wide distribution of metallicities , eps are mainly super - solar . +",
    "two significant correlations exist for this cluster : @xmath20 and @xmath64 ( see fig . [ c4 ] ) .",
    "the first implies that lower mass eps have higher @xmath3 , thus the mechanisms for the pumping - up of the eccentricity are more active in low mass planets , at least for the high semi - major axes and moderate positive metallicities of this cluster .",
    "moreover , ep masses are correlated with stellar masses .",
    "this may confirm the fact that higher @xmath5 implies larger proto - planetary disk surface density and hence larger @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath57_4 _ contains 12 eps in msss and 12 in mps ( see tables [ tab ] and [ tab_sup ] ) .",
    "notice that the mss planets may be responsible of the @xmath20 correlation as many of them have low @xmath0 and high @xmath3 .",
    "this cluster contains 31 eps ( see tables [ tab ] and [ tab_sup ] ) , and the prototype is hd  117207  b. planetary masses have intermediate values , with a mean of @xmath92 and a standard deviation of @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution is rather flat spanning from 0.37 to 3  au , with a few bodies around 4  au .",
    "eccentricities are peaked at 0.2 - 0.3 , and range from 0.2 to 0.5 .",
    "stellar masses are super - solar , having mean and standard deviation of 1.22 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "stellar metallicities are also remarkably super - solar , having mean and standard deviation of 0.15 and 0.15  dex ( see fig .",
    "[ c_comparison ] ) . + the formally significant correlations are : @xmath64 , @xmath79[fe / h ] and @xmath21 .",
    "however they are all due to outlier planets and thus can not be considered as real ( notice that if we do not consider the outliers , the correlation @xmath21 is very close to the 5% significancy level , thus it may become significant as more objects are added to this cluster by future discoveries ) .",
    "+ it contains 7 eps in msss and only one hot jupiter ( namely , hd  118203  b ) .",
    "it is interesting to understand why this hot jupiter is in this cluster .",
    "the peculiarity of hd  118203  b is that it has the highest eccentricity ( 0.309 ) among hot jupiters .",
    "notice that hd  185269  b ( in @xmath57_3 _ ) also has a very high eccentricity of 0.3 .",
    "all the other input variables are the same , except for the planetary mass .",
    "hd  118203  b with a mass of @xmath95 is one of the most massive hot jupiters .",
    "this explains why hd  118203  b has been put in this cluster .",
    "this cluster contains 13 eps in mps . + despite the lack of any correlation , few comments may be added to uncover the nature of this cluster .",
    "@xmath61_4 _ and @xmath65_5 _ have some similar traits .",
    "they have spread and rather flat distributions of input variables .",
    "moreover , both have large semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "however , @xmath61_5 _ contains objects with higher stellar masses , lower eccentricities and lower masses than @xmath57_4_.",
    "in this paper we develop the basis for an extrasolar planet taxonomy .",
    "we use as many inputs as possible for this analysis , in particular the planetary mass , semi - major axis , eccentricity , stellar mass and stellar metallicity .",
    "we identify the best procedure to follow : a multivariate statistical analysis ( pca ) to find the most important variables , and then hierarchical cluster analysis .",
    "we analyze the solutions via canonical means ( through the cophenetic coefficient ) and by analysis of the distribution of the dendrogram s heights .",
    "the best result is achieved with non traditional metric and merging algorithms , namely the pearson correlation metric and weighted centroid cluster merging .",
    "we reject the absence of clustering structure with monte carlo simulations , and also test the stability of the solution against observational errors of the input variables .",
    "the procedure we followed is able to provide a roboust extrasolar planet taxonomy even if the number of planets is still low .",
    "the general traits of the taxonomy developed here will be updated as more planets become available .",
    "+ our best solution consists of five clusters . we discuss their properties with respect to the physically relevant input variables .",
    "we show the importance of including the environmental variables ( @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] ) to discriminate between otherwise similar planets ; and also to merge together different bodies ( like ep in msss and orbiting single stars ) .",
    "for instance , we were able to divide the hot jupiters into -at least- 2 main groups ( see tab .",
    "[ tab ] ) .",
    "this division is mainly due to the stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "those belonging to @xmath57_3 _ basically orbit around stars with super - solar masses and high metallicities ; those of @xmath61_2 _ orbit mostly sub - solar mass stars with moderate ( both positive and negative ) metallicities .",
    "this may reflect differences in the formation processes of these eps .",
    "+ jupiter belongs to cluster @xmath61_3_. much as been speculated about the similarity of our solar system and extrasolar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular concerning the formation histories . with the help of cluster analysis we may identify those eps which are more similar -in the 3-fold clustering space- to jupiter",
    "we suggest that the actual large semi - major axis of jupiter is the result of its formation in a solar - like metallicity disk .",
    "+ we also analyzed the intra - cluster correlations , since this may provide important information about the formation and evolution of bodies within a cluster .",
    "this is crucial in order to uncover information which may be hidden in the `` blind '' statistical analysis performed on the whole ep database .",
    "the most important correlations found are those for @xmath57_2 _ , @xmath57_3 _ and @xmath65_4 _ ( see tab .",
    "[ tab ] ) .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath61_2 _ and @xmath57_3 _ we find important trends between metallicity and orbital parameters .",
    "we find that [ fe / h ] has very important effects on the semi - major axis ( and thus on the migration processes ) and the eccentricity .",
    "it may also happen that the same variables correlate in an opposite way between two different clusters ( see the @xmath64 correlations for @xmath57_1 _ and @xmath57_4 _ ) .",
    "moreover , we also studied the distribution of planets in multiple star systems in each cluster .",
    "they do not seem to play a particular role in the corresponding cluster correlations .",
    "similar considerations apply also for multiple planet systems .",
    "+ in addition to these main five clusters , we may see the position of the pulsar planets in the clustering space .",
    "obviously these planets were not included in the previous analysis because we do not have @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "however we may use as test values @xmath96 for the progenitors of both psr  1257 + 12 and psr  b1620 - 26 . as for the metallicity we assume 0 and",
    "-1.05 ( the first is an indicative value , the latter is the average for m4 stars ) , respectively . using the formule ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we find that these planets are very far from all the other eps in the clustering space , and hence for each pulsar we have a single cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the very likely different origin of the pulsar planets with respect to other eps .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the guidelines for an extrasolar planet taxonomy . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of an increasing number of extrasolar planets showing a vast variety of _ planetary parameters _ , like keplerian orbital elements and _ environmental parameters _ , like stellar masses , spectral types , metallicity etc . , prompts the development of a planetary taxonomy . in this work via principal component analysis followed by hierarchical clustering analysis , we report the definition of five robust groups of planets . we also discuss the physical relevance of such analysis , which may provide a valid basis for disentangling the role of the several physical parameters involved in the processes of planet formation and subsequent evolution . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we were able to divide the hot jupiters into two main groups on the basis of their stellar masses and metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for some groups , we find strong correlations between metallicity , semi - major axis and eccentricity . the implications of these findings are discussed . </S>"
