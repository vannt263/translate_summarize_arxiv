    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation(bec ) in dilute vapors of ultra - cold(nanokelvin ) alkali atoms@xcite , and other systems @xcite , trapped in harmonic potential wells has qualitatively extended the domain of occurrence of the quantum fluids@xcite . unlike their dense and strongly interacting homogeneous ( bulk ) counterparts , e.g. liquid @xmath16he , these mesoscopic gaseous systems are dilute , weakly or moderately interacting and inhomogeneous@xmath17with controllable density , effective dimensionality , and tunable atom - atom interactions of either sign@xcite .",
    "further , the creation @xcite of the vortex states with quantized circulation in externally rotated traps , as also the direct observation of phase coherence effects@xcite , has clearly revealed the phase rigidity characteristic of superfluidity associated with the bec .",
    "the bec in a weakly and repulsively interacting dilute bose gas ( _ i.e. _ with the s - wave scattering length @xmath18 the mean inter - atomic spacing and with the number of atoms in the condensate n@xmath19 1 ) has often been described macroscopically through the gross - pitaevskii equation based on the condensate amplitude as a slowly varying order - parameter @xcite .",
    "microscopic treatments going beyond the meanfield approximation and based on the many - body variational wavefunctions also exist , but involve heavy computations@xcite even for modest size of the system @xmath20 .",
    "besides , these many - body calculations have involved only the `` lowest landau level(lll ) '' single - particle orbitals , with only the positive sign(with respect to the trap angular velocity @xmath21 ) of the single - particle angular momentum quantum number @xmath22 .",
    "the inter - atomic repulsion is known to qualitatively change the ground state properties of a system of weakly interacting neutral bose gas ( confined in a rotating harmonic trap ) at t=0 in two distinct ways @xcite .",
    "first , it leads to a depletion of the condensate fraction , which is equal to 1 for an ideal(non - interacting ) bose gas .",
    "second , it gives a phase rigidity , or stiffness , to the ground state many - body wavefunction .",
    "this is responsible for the superfluid flow that manifests in the successive appearance of vortices with higher quantized circulations beyond certain critical angular velocities @xmath23 of the rotating trap .",
    "both these aspects are well described by the one - particle reduced density - matrix @xmath24 obtained from the n - body ground - state wavefunction @xmath25 by partial integration , or tracing out of the n-1 co - ordinates from the n - body pure density - matrix @xmath26 .",
    "( it is to be recalled in passing here that the condensate and the superfluid fractions are not the same thing .",
    "more specifically , e.g. , for the non - rotating ground state , the condensate fraction is generally less than unity while the superfluid fraction , that includes the condensate as well as the above - the - condensate fraction , is exactly equal to unity .",
    "however , both the condensate as well as the superfluid fractions are characterized by the same quantum - mechanical phase whose gradient gives the superfluid velocity .",
    "also , both vanish together above the critical temperature t@xmath27 .",
    "in fact , it is the condensate that amplifies the effect of even the weakest repulsive interaction leading to absence of single - particle excitation and giving rise to the phase rigidity ) .",
    "+ in this work , we have studied the effect of the 2-body repulsive interaction on the condensate fraction , and on the the critical angular velocities@xmath28 for the appearance of different vortex states for a quasi-2d bose gas confined in a highly anisotropic harmonic trap @xmath29 which is subjected to an overall rotation @xmath1 about the z - axis . to this end",
    "we use a variational approach and calculate the ground state energy , the ground state wavefunction and the associated one - particle reduced density - matrix for different values of the interaction , in given subspaces of the total quantized angular momentum l@xmath3 .",
    "the many - body variational ground state wavefunction is obtained through the exact diagonalization of the n@xmath30n many - body hamiltonian matrix with , e.g. , n@xmath31 for l@xmath3=n=15 , using davidson s algorithm .",
    "a distinctive feature of the present work is that in constructing the many - body variational ground state wavefunction for a given l@xmath3 ( @xmath32 the eigenvalue corresponding to the z - component of the total angular momentum operator @xmath33 ) , we have included , in the configuration interaction , the one - particle states with the single - particle angular momentum@xmath34 quantum number @xmath22 of _ either _ sign , as also the higher `` landau - level(ll ) '' states .",
    "one of our main results is the variation of the critical angular velocities @xmath35 with the interaction strength @xmath36(the meanings of various symbols will be given in the next section ) , namely , that not only does @xmath37 decrease with increasing @xmath38 , it also stays systematically higher than its non - varional value , e.g. , that given by the relation @xmath39 for the weakly interacting , dilute case@xcite .",
    "we have also observed that the condensate fraction for the single vortex state with l@xmath3=n(as also for the higher vortex states ) does not change significantly even if the 2-body scattering length @xmath40 is changed over @xmath41 orders of magnitude in the moderately to the weakly interacting regime , namely , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bohr radius . + this paper",
    "is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we begin with a more general system to bring out , in passing , the mathematical analogy between the system under study here and the other well known systems like in the landau - darwin - fock problem and argue that in a certain limiting case of interest to us here , it becomes essential to go beyond the lowest landau level(lll ) approximation so as to include higher lls and with the single - particle angular momentum eigenvalue @xmath22 taking both positive as well as negative values in constructing the many - body basis functions .",
    "section 3 describes briefly the constrction of the many - body basis functions and the determination of the variational ground state wavefunction by diagonalizing the many - body hamiltonian matrix using davidson s algorithm . in section 4 ,",
    "we outline the procedure for determining the critical angular velocities for the entry of the vortices into the system , and the determination of various density profiles obtained from the one - particle reduced density - matrix characterizing the vortical state . finally , in section 5",
    ", we present and discuss our results , and end the paper with a brief conclusion .",
    "we begin by considering the general case of a system of interacting , spinless , charged particles ( bosons ) confined in an external harmonic potential(trap ) .",

    "this reflects the radial variation of the relative fractional weights @xmath206 of the different fractions with @xmath204 .",
    "the results and discussions given below refer to the following choice of parameters : @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , where @xmath44 is the bohr radius .",
    "please note that the scattering length @xmath40 chosen above is 10 times more than as given in @xcite for @xmath210rb .",
    "further , we present here the results for n=15 only in the angular momentum regime @xmath142 .",
    "we have , however , done the calculations for n=6 and n=10 also .",
    "first we note that we are always in the dilute gas limit here inasmuch as @xmath211 , with @xmath212 .",
    "further , we are also in the regime of moderate @xmath213 to very weak@xmath214 interaction strength as the parameter @xmath215 is of order 1 or much much less than 1 for the two regimes respectively .",
    "moreover for @xmath209 , the healing length @xmath216 , with @xmath217 , the mean particle density ) @xmath218 the oscillator length @xmath219 the size of the system .",
    "thus our study for the above choice of paremeters may be relevant to bulk systems .",
    "+ the critical angular velocity @xmath37 for the single - vortex state@xmath220 decreases for increasing value of n. thus for @xmath209 , it is @xmath221 and @xmath222 for n=10 and 15 respectively . for a given n ,",
    "the critical angular velocity @xmath37 is also found to decrease with inceasing scattering length @xmath40 .",
    "thus for n=15 , @xmath35(in units of @xmath223 ) are for found to be @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 for @xmath228 respectively . the condensate fraction for a given n and corresponding to one of the stable vortex states , however , seems to be quite insesitive to a change in the scattering length .",
    "thus for l@xmath3=n=15 state and @xmath229 , the condensate fractions@xmath230 are found to be @xmath231 respectively .",
    "+ in table 1 , we summarize our results for the ground state of the n=15 system in different subspaces of the total angular momentum l@xmath3 in the regime @xmath232 for @xmath209 .",
    "as the system is rotated , a number of ( total ) angular momentum states are found to be stable at successively higher angular velocities @xmath233 .",
    "we have also given the density - matrix eigenvalues@xmath234 and the corresponding single - particle angular momentum quantum number@xmath235 for the largest three fractions@xmath236 .",
    "we note that , corresponding to each of the stable ground states of the rotating system , namely , l@xmath237 for n=15 , the second largest fraction is found to be non - rotating , _ i.e. _ @xmath238 .",
    "the single - particle angular momentum quantum number @xmath239 , corresponding to the largest fraction , is taken to be the vorticity of the condensate .",
    "+ figure 1 gives the l@xmath240 phase diagram , or the stability line .",
    "one can readily identify the successive critical angular velocities @xmath241 for the transition from one stable state to another stable state .",
    "several points are to be noted here .",
    "the non - integral values for the angular momentum per particle clearly indicates the incomplete condensation , i.e. , the fact that more than one eigenvalues @xmath184 of the reduced density - matrix are non - zero .",
    "this is , however , not to be taken as the fragmented condensate@xcite , but merely as depletion of the condensate / superfluid fraction due to the interaction and the rotation .",
    "also , we have observed that the critical angular velocity @xmath13 decreases monotonically with increasing repulsive interaction and the particle number .",
    "this can be readily understood physically from the expression in equation([4p4 ] ) for the critical angular velocity @xmath242 if one remembers that the non - rotating ( l@xmath171 angular momentum ) state is more compact and , therefore , has its energy raised ( because of the repulsive interaction ) relative to the expanded higher angular momentum states .",
    "more importantly , however , our critical angular velocity @xmath13 for a given n , is systematically greater than the non - variational value based on the yrast - like state @xcite .",
    "we expect this to be due to our more accurate and , therefore , lower variational ground state energies .",
    "+ in fig.(2a ) we have plotted the total ( the condensate+the non - rotating component+the above - the - condensate fraction ) density profile @xmath243 for the l@xmath3=n single - vortex angular momentum state of the system .",
    "we have also plotted separately the density profiles for the condensate fraction @xmath244 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath245 in fig.(2b ) , the non - rotating component @xmath246 corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue @xmath247 in fig.(2c ) , and the above - the condensate fraction in fig.(2d ) corresponding to the remaining components of the one - particle reduced density matrix : @xmath248 where , as we have earlier , @xmath192 is the single - particle angular momentum quantum number associated with the @xmath249th component of the density - matrix .",
    "as we go to higher @xmath1 , the condensate depletes@xmath17with the non - rotating component and the above - the - condensate fractions becoming more pronounced(as can also be seen from table 1 ) .",
    "+ figure 3 depicts the velocity profile for the total system(3a ) , for the condensate(3b ) , for the non - rotating component(3c ) , and for the above - the - condensate fractions(3d ) respectively .",
    "+ figure 4 depicts the circulation profile for circular paths of radii @xmath204 in the x - y plane : ( 4a ) for the total system , ( 4b ) for the condensate fraction , ( 4c ) for the non - rotating fraction , and ( 4d ) for the above - the - condensate fraction respectively .",
    "as can readily be seen , the condensate fraction has an integral circulation and is constant over space , while the total as well as the above - the - condensate fraction has non - integral circulation and varies with @xmath204 as explained earlier below equation([crcln ] ) .",
    "+ in conclusion , our many - body variational calculation for an admittedly finite number @xmath250 of particles explicitly resolves the structure of the rotating bec at t=0 in terms of the various components of the reduced one - particle density - matrix .",
    "further work is in progress to consider spin-1 bose particles , where we expect qualitative changes in the structure of the rotating bec . in particular",
    ", we expect a dramatic increase in the critical angular velocities because of the spin - polarization drag effect inasmuch as the angular momentum may be absorbed preferentially in the spin rather than the orbital degrees of freedom without costing kinetic energy .",
    "this could lead to spin polarization due to rotation of the trap@xcite .",
    "we expect this effect to be more pronounced here than in a classical rotating system .",
