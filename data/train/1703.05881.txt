    "conversely , suppose that @xmath18 is an @xmath57-correspondence homomorphism of @xmath56 to @xmath0 .",

    "we will be able to conclude that between any large sets of @xmath55 s and @xmath77 s there is at least one edge of @xmath75 and at least one edge of @xmath76 .",
    "this allows the above idea of using majority values to work , namely if @xmath18 is a correspondence homomorphism on the replaced graph , we may define @xmath78 to be the majority value of @xmath59 and similarly for @xmath79 .",
    "then the two values appear at both an edge labelled by @xmath73 and an edge labelled by @xmath74 , and so @xmath63 is a correspondence homomorphism on the original graph @xmath1 .",
    "there are many known proofs that such expanders @xmath75 do exist @xcite .",
    "it is also not hard to see directly .",
    "for instance , if @xmath80 , let @xmath81 and take for @xmath75 a random bipartite graph on @xmath67 versus @xmath67 vertices .",
    "the number of ways of choosing sets of size @xmath82 for both sides is @xmath83 .",
    "the probability that the sets will not be joined by a random choice of edges is bounded by @xmath84 , giving a positive probability to the existence of a suitable bipartite graph @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a reflexive clique , the correspondence @xmath0-homomorphism problem can be trivially solved .",
    "each vertex @xmath8 of the input graph @xmath1 can be assigned any image , and regardless of the permutation labels @xmath11 , the mapping is an @xmath11-consistent homomorphism .",
    "in fact , this observation also solves the correspondence @xmath0-list - homomorphism problem .",
    "if @xmath0 is a reflexive co - clique , the correspondence @xmath0-homomorphism problem also has an easy solution , since every choice of an image for a vertex @xmath8 of @xmath1 implies a unique image of any adjacent vertex @xmath10 .",
    "thus for each component of @xmath1 we may try all images of a particular vertex @xmath8 , and the component can be mapped to @xmath0 if and only if one of these images produces an @xmath11-consistent homomorphism .",
    "this also works for the correspondence list @xmath0-homomorphism problem problem .",
    "the most interesting case occurs when @xmath85 .",
    "we name the vertices of @xmath0 by binary 2-strings , @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to the loops @xmath87 , the two edges of @xmath0 are , say , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "note that because of symmetry , there are only three different permutations of @xmath0 , this one , with edges @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and two more , with edges @xmath90 and @xmath91 , or with edges @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "consider the alternate view via the auxiliary graph @xmath21 discussed earlier .",
    "for each edge @xmath5 of an input graph @xmath1 , the edges between @xmath22 and @xmath24 depend only on which of the above possibilities apply to each of @xmath22 and @xmath24 , because of the nature of the adjacencies , in the form of two copies of @xmath94",
    ". moreover , it does not matter which vertex on each side of the @xmath94 is chosen .",
    "( here we use @xmath94 to denote the _ irreflexive _ complete bipartite graph with two vertices on each side ; see figure 1 . )",
    "let us associate with each vertex @xmath8 of @xmath1 , two @xmath95 variables @xmath96 , to be understood as describing the two coordinates of the name of the chosen vertex for @xmath22 .",
    "each of the above partitions of @xmath2 into two edges can now be described by linear equations modulo two :    * @xmath88 and @xmath89 correspond to the equations @xmath97 and @xmath98 * @xmath90 and @xmath91 correspond to the equations @xmath99 and @xmath100 * @xmath92 and @xmath93 correspond to the equations @xmath101 and @xmath102    in figure 1 , we have the partition on @xmath22 corresponding to the first bullet , and the partition of @xmath24 corresponding to the second bullet , while the edges of @xmath103 joint the first part of the partition on @xmath22 with the second part of the partition on @xmath24 and vice versa .",
    "to satisfy the constraints of correspondence , we have to make sure that if @xmath8 selects a vertex in the part with @xmath97 , then @xmath10 selects a vertex in the part with @xmath104 , and if @xmath8 selects in @xmath98 then @xmath10 selects in @xmath105 .",
    "these constraints can be expressed by the linear equation @xmath106 . in all the other cases it is also easy to check that there is a linear equation modulo two , which describes the constraints .",
    "thus we have reduced the problem of existence of a correspondence @xmath45-homomorphism to a system of linear equations modulo two , which can be solved in polynomial - time , e.g. , by gaussian elimination .",
    "modulo two , height=226 ]    it turns out , see the next section , that the list version of the correspondence @xmath45-homomorphism problem is np - complete .",
    "we begin with the following simple example .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is @xmath107 , the disjoint union of a reflexive cliques @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath107 have a loop on @xmath110 , and two adjacent loops on @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the correspondence @xmath107-homomorphism problem is np - complete .",
    "we give a reduction from the problem 1-in-3-sat ( without negated variables ) .",

    "construct the corresponding instance of the correspondence @xmath0-homomorphism problem as follows .",
    "the instance @xmath1 will contain vertices @xmath115 , as well as @xmath116 , and all edges are of the form @xmath117 with @xmath118 appearing in the triple @xmath119 .",
    "the variables in the triples are arbitrarily ordered , each @xmath119 having a first , second , and third variable .",
    "the edge between @xmath119 and its first variable @xmath120 is labeled so that the special vertex @xmath110 in @xmath121 is adjacent to @xmath110 in @xmath122 , the edge between @xmath119 and its second variable @xmath123 is labeled so that the special vertex @xmath110 in @xmath124 is adjacent to @xmath111 in @xmath122 , and similarly for the third variable and @xmath112 in @xmath122 .",
    "( see figure 2 . ) because of the adjacencies , if any one vertex @xmath8 is chosen in @xmath122 , there is exactly one of its variables @xmath125 that has its special vertex @xmath110 adjacent to @xmath8 .     with variables @xmath125 , considered in that order , height=340 ]",
    "we claim that this instance has a correspondence homomorphism if and only if the original instance of 1-in-3-sat was satisfiable . indeed",
    ", any satisfying truth assignment sets as true a set of @xmath118 s such that exactly one appears in each @xmath119 ; hence we can set the value of the vertex @xmath118 to be @xmath110 whenever the variable @xmath118 was true in the truth assignment ( and , say , @xmath111 otherwise ) .",
    "the value of the vertex @xmath119 will be @xmath110 if its first variable was true , @xmath111 if its second variable was true , and @xmath112 if its third variable was true .",
    "it is easy to see that this defines a correspondence @xmath107-homomorphism . for the converse ,",
    "observe that a correspondence homomorphism selects one vertex from each @xmath122 , which forces exactly one of its variable to select the value @xmath110 , thus defining a satisfying truth assignment .",
    "we now note that the correspondence @xmath45-_list - homomorphism _ problem is also np - complete , since the correspondence @xmath126-homomorphism problem reduces to the correspondence @xmath45-list - homomorphism problem .",
    "indeed , lists may be used to restrict the input vertices never to use one of the four vertices of @xmath45 .",
    "a similar reduction from 1-in - t - sat shows the following fact .",
    "the correspondence @xmath127-homomorphism problem is np - complete , for all @xmath128 .",
    "the method we use most often is described in the following proposition .",
    "[ last ] the correspondence @xmath129-homomorphism problem reduces to the correspondence @xmath130-homomorphism problem .",
    "given an instance @xmath1 of the @xmath129-homomorphism problem , we create a new graph @xmath46 by adding at each vertex @xmath131 of @xmath1 a loop @xmath132 ( even if @xmath131 may already have loops ) , labelled by two permutations @xmath133 that forbid one vertex of @xmath40 and one vertex of @xmath41 .",

    "now we claim that @xmath46 has a correspondence @xmath129-homomorphism if and only if the original graph @xmath1 has a correspondence @xmath130-homomorphism .",
    "indeed , if @xmath18 is a correspondence @xmath129-homomorphism for the target graph has neither @xmath110 nor @xmath111 , and so , the added loops create no problem , i.e. , @xmath18 remains a correspondence @xmath130-homomorphism . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath18 is a @xmath130-homomorphism of @xmath46 , the label on @xmath132 ensures that @xmath131 can not map to @xmath110 or @xmath111 as neither @xmath136 is adjacent to @xmath137 nor @xmath138 is adjacent to @xmath139 .",
    "thus @xmath18 is also a @xmath129-homomorphism .",
    "proposition [ last ] allows us to prove the np - completeness of the correspondence @xmath130-homomorphism problem from the np - completeness of the correspondence @xmath129-homomorphism problem .",
