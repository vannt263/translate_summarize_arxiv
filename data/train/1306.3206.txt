    "in the last thirty years the variable stars in the globular cluster ngc  6333 ( m9 or c1716 - 184 in the iau nomenclature ) ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , j2000 ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) have been the subject of some analyses based on photographic and ccd time - series photometry ( clement , ip & robert 1984 ; clement & walker 1991 ; clement & shelton 1996 ; 1999 ) .",
    "the 2012 update for ngc  6333 in the clement et al .",
    "( 2001 ) catalogue of variable stars in globular clusters ( cvsgc ) lists 21 known variable stars ; 9 rrab , 9 rrc , , 1 long period variable ( v8 ) , 1 pop ii cepheid ( v12 ) and 1 eclipsing binary ( v21 ) .",
    "this makes the cluster attractive for a fourier decomposition analysis of the rr lyrae star light curves with the aim of calculating their physical parameters from semi - empirical calibrations .",
    "furthermore , this cluster has a crowded central region where it is difficult to perform conventional point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry .",
    "the application of difference image analysis ( dia ) to image data for this cluster for the first time therefore opens up the possibility of new variable star discoveries .",
    "recently our team has performed ccd photometry of several globular clusters by employing the dia technique to produce precise time - series photometry of individual stars down to @xmath12 19.5 mag .",
    "the dia photometry has proven to be a very useful tool in obtaining high quality light curves of known variables , and for discovering and classifying new variables ( e.g. arellano ferro et al .",
    "2011 ; bramich et al .",
    "2011 ; kains et al . 2012 ; figuera jaimes et al .",
    "2013 ; and references therein ) , where previous ccd photometric studies have not detected stellar variability , particularly in the crowded central regions of the clusters .",
    "thus , in the present paper we report the analysis of new time - series photometry of ngc 6333 in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters . in @xmath13 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reductions . in @xmath13 3 the problem of the differential reddening in the cluster field - of - view ( fov )",
    "is addressed and the approach we used to correct it is described .",
    "@xmath13 4 contains a detailed discussion on the approach to the identification of new variables and their classification . in @xmath13 5",
    "we apply fourier light curve decomposition to some of the rr lyrae stars and calculate their metallicity and absolute magnitude . given the differential reddening correction , the accuracy in the cluster distance determination is highlighted . in @xmath13 6",
    "we discuss the @xmath14 relation for the rr lyrae stars and the oosterhoff type of the cluster . in @xmath13 7",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the observations employed in the present work were performed using the johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters on 15 nights during 2010 - 2012 at two different observatories .",
    "the 2.0 m telescope of the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle , india , located at 4500 m above sea level , was used to obtain 212 and 171 epochs in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , respectively .",
    "the detector was a thompson ccd of 2048@xmath152048 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.296 arcsec / pix translating to a fov of approximately 10.1@xmath1510.1  arcmin@xmath16 .",
    "also , the danish faint object spectrograph and camera ( dfosc ) at the danish 1.54 m telescope at la silla , chile , was used to collect 118 epochs in the @xmath0 filter .",
    "dfosc has a 2147@xmath152101 pixel loral ccd with a pixel scale of 0.396  arcsec / pix and a fov of @xmath1714.2@xmath1513.9  arcmin@xmath16 .",
    "the log of observations is shown in table [ tab : observations ] where the dates , site , number of frames , exposure times and average nightly seeing are recorded .",

    "v13 and v33 are not cluster members .    for the rrc stars we employ the calibrations :    @xmath19}_{zw } = 52.466~p^2 ~-~ 30.075~p ~+~ 0.131~\\phi^{(c)~2}_{31}\\ ] ] @xmath20    @xmath21    given by morgan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and kovcs ( 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "the standard deviations of the above calibrations are 0.14 dex and 0.042 mag respectively . for eq .",
    "[ eq : k98 ] the zero point was reduced to 1.061 mag to make the luminosities of the rrc consistent with the distance modulus of 18.5  mag for the lmc ( see discussions by cacciari et al .",
    "2005 and arellano ferro et al .",
    "the original zero point given by kovcs ( 1998 ) is 1.261 .    in the above calibrations",
    "the phases are calculated either from series of sines or of cosines as indicated by the superscript .",
    "we transformed our cosine series phases into the sine ones where necessary via the relation   @xmath22 .",
    "the physical parameters for the rr lyrae stars are reported in table  [ fisicos ] .",
    "we have not included the star v3 since it has prominent blazhko modulations and v9 because our observations are not sufficient to cover the complete light curve . despite the fact that most rrc stars show to some extent amplitude and/or phase modulations , in calculating mean parameters , we only excluded stars with extreme modulations ; namely v18 and v22 .",
    "v19 was also not considered given its double - mode nature .",
    "we also excluded v13 and v33 which are not cluster members .",
    "v14 was considered only after the light curve was phased with the period change rate included , i.e. the light curve in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcpdot ] .",
    "the inverse variance square weighted means are also given in table  [ fisicos ] . the systematic error in the metallicity estimates is of the order of the scatter in the calibrations of eqs .",
    "[ eq : jk96 ] and [ eq : morgan07 ] , i.e. 0.14 dex .",
    "thus , the metallicity obtained from the rrab and rrc stars is [ fe / h]@xmath23 which can be converted to the new scale defined by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using uves spectra of rgb stars in globular clusters by [ fe / h]@xmath24= @xmath25 + 0.130[fe / h]@xmath26[fe / h]@xmath27 .",
    "we find [ fe / h]@xmath28 .",
    "clement & shelton ( 1999 ) found , from the light curve fourier decomposition of v2 , v4 , v6 and v7 , the average [ fe / h]@xmath29 in good agreement with our result .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "no iron abundance of ngc  6333 has been calculated from high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the first calculation of [ fe / h]@xmath30 was made from integrated photometry in the q@xmath31 index calibration by zinn ( 1980 ) and reported by harris ( 1996 ) ( 2010 edition ) on the modern @xmath32 scale , [ fe / h]@xmath33 .",
    "the iron abundance of ngc  6333 has also been estimated by costar & smith ( 1988 ) from the preston ( 1959 ) @xmath34 parameter estimated on v1 and v3 .",
    "these authors calculated a [ fe / h ] value of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for these two variables respectively , for an average of @xmath37 .",
    "they used the @xmath34-[fe / h ] calibration of butler ( 1975 ) .",
    "had they used the calibration of suntzeff , kraft & kinman ( 1994 ) for rrab stars or jurcsik s ( 1995 ) or fernley s et al .",
    "( 1998 ) their average [ fe / h ] would have been @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . the value [ fe / h]=@xmath38 is commonly cited in the literature on ngc  6333 , most likely from the @xmath34 result .",
    "we have to note however that the @xmath34 values were obtained only on two rr lyrae stars ( v1 and v3 ) at a single phase and that the method is strongly phase dependent .",
    "we should also keep in mind that v3 is a clear blazhko variable .",
    "thus , despite the good numerical agreement with our results we do not find the comparison of particular relevance , and believe that our result [ fe / h]@xmath23 is more solidly sustained .",
    "the weighted mean @xmath41 values for the rrab and rrc stars are 0.467@xmath420.001 mag and 0.554@xmath420.001 mag respectively ( see table [ fisicos ] ) and will be used in section [ sec : distance ] to estimate the mean distance to the cluster after differential reddening is considered .",
    "the values of @xmath41 in table  [ fisicos ] were transformed into @xmath43 .",
    "the bolometric correction was calculated using the formula @xmath44 [ fe / h]@xmath45 given by sandage & cacciari ( 1990 ) .",
    "we adopted the value @xmath46 mag .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath47 can be estimated for rrab stars from the calibrations of jurcsik ( 1998 ) :    @xmath48},\\ ] ]    with    @xmath49 @xmath50    for the rrc stars the calibration of simon & clement ( 1993 ) can be used :    @xmath51    the validity and caveats of the above calibrations have been discussed in several recent papers ( cacciari et al .",
    "2005 ; arellano ferro et al .",
    "2008 ; 2010 ; bramich et al .",
    "2011 ) and the reader is referred to them for the details .",
    "we list the obtained @xmath52 values for the rr lyrae stars in ngc 6333 for comparison with similar work in other clusters .",
    "once the period , luminosity and temperature are known for each rr lyrae star , its mass and radius can be estimated from the equations : @xmath53 ( van albada & baker 1971 ) and @xmath54=@xmath55 respectively .",
    "the masses and radii are given in table [ fisicos ] in solar units .",
    "the weighted mean @xmath41 , calculated for the rrab and rrc in table [ fisicos ] can be used to estimate the true distance modulus ; @xmath56 .",
    "the individual colour excesses are listed in table [ tab : fourier_coeffs ] which were calculated after differential reddening was considered ( @xmath13 [ sec : reddening ] ) . although the internal errors in @xmath41 are small , given the mean magnitude dispersion in the hb , a better estimate of the uncertainty in the distance is the standard deviation of the mean and so we find the distance modulus of @xmath57 mag and @xmath58 mag using the rrab and rrc stars respectively , which correspond to the distances @xmath6 and @xmath59 kpc .",
    "the above distances for the rrab and rrc stars are calculated from independent empirical calibrations , with their own systematic uncertainties , hence they should be considered as two independent estimates .",
    "the correction for differential reddening has contributed to the good agreement between these two estimates of the distance and to reduce the uncertainties .",
    "the distance to ngc  6333 listed in the catalogue of harris ( 1996 ) ( 2010 edition ) is 7.9 kpc , estimated from the mean @xmath41 magnitudes calculated by clement & shelton ( 1999 ) .",
    "the calibrations of @xmath41 used by clement & shelton for the rrab and rrc stars are the same as our equations [ eq : w01 ] and [ eq : k98 ] but before correcting the zero points as discussed in @xmath13 [ sec : femv ] . also , in their calculation of the distance the differential reddening was not taken into account .",
    "these facts may account for the small difference in the distance we derive for the cluster .",
    "the most recent discussion on the distance of the cluster is perhaps the one given by casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in which they adopt the distance 7.9 kpc from harris ( 1996 ) ( 2010 edition ) but argue that due to reasonable uncertainties in the distance (  10% ) the alternative distance of 8.6 kpc is selected such that it places the cluster on the opposite side of the galactic centre . in our opinion and given our results , 10% is large for a distance error and note that if our distance is adopted then the cluster would be located on the near side of the galactic centre .",
    "using the periods listed in table [ variables ] , we calculate mean periods of 0.639 and 0.336  d for the 8 rrab and 10 rrc stars , respectively , that are cluster members ( i.e. excluding v13 and v33 ) , and excluding the rrd star v19 .",
    "these values clearly identify ngc  6333 as an oosterhoff type ii cluster .",
    "the bailey diagram ( log @xmath60 vs @xmath61 and log @xmath60 vs @xmath62 ) for the rr lyrae variables is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] .",
    "the rrab stars have longer periods for a given amplitude than their counterparts in the ooi cluster m3 .",
    "this is also seen in the ooii clusters m53 ( arellano ferro et al .",
    "2011 ) , m15 and m68 ( cacciari et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this fact confirms the ooii type of ngc  6333 .",
    "v13 and v33 are discordant stars and this supports the idea that they are not cluster members ( clement et al .",
    "1984 , @xmath13 [ sec : ind_stars ] ) .",
    "other than v13 and v33 there are no rrab stars with peculiar amplitude , which gives support to the physical parameters obtained in @xmath13 [ sec : rrlstars ] from the light curve fourier decomposition .",
    "the rrc stars show some scatter which is likely due to the amplitude modulations observed in the population of rrc stars in ngc 6333 , the majority of the rrc stars seem to show some amplitude and/or phase modulations that can be attributed to the blazhko effect ( see @xmath13 [ sec : ind_stars ] and fig .  [ varsc ] ) .",
    "a similar case was found in ngc  5024 which probably contains the largest sample of rrc blazhko variables ( arellano ferro et al . 2011 ; 2012 ) .    as in arellano ferro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for ngc 5024 , in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "being the two clusters of the ooii type and of similar metallicity , the match is rewarding .     and @xmath1 bands .",
    "in the top panel the solid lines represent the average distributions of fundamental and first overtone rrl s in m3 .",
    "the segmented lines are the loci for the evolved stars according to cacciari et al .",
    "filled symbols are used for rrab stars and open symbols for rrc stars .",
    "circles represent stars with no apparent signs of amplitude modulations and triangles indicate stars with clear and prominent amplitude modulations or blazhko variables .",
    "variables with secular period change , v14 and v18 and the double mode star v19 are shown as squares . v13 and v33 are not cluster members .",
    "the bottom panel shows the case for the @xmath1 amplitudes .",
    "the solid curve is the locus defined by arellano ferro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the rrab stars in the ooii cluster ngc 5024.,width=302,height=453 ]",
    "in their analysis on the completeness of the variable stars sample in ngc 6333 , clement & shelton ( 1996 ) concluded that the discovery of new rrc stars was unlikely but that some rrab stars might have escaped their attention .",
    "in fact , we have not found any new rr lyrae , neither rrab nor rrc , in the corresponding field of clement & shelton s images .",
    "however , we found in this work two rrc stars , v22 and v23 , and one rrab , v33 ; the three of them are relatively isolated in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "while v22 and v23 are clear members of ngc  6333 , v33 is a field rrab further away than the cluster .",
    "likewise we corroborate that the rrab star v13 is not a cluster member .",
    "we have also been able to find three new eclipsing binaries and seven long period variables .",
    "pulsation period refinements have been calculated for nearly all variables .",
    "accurate celestial coordinates and a finding chart for all previously known and new variables are provided .",
    "although a cluster membership confirmation from radial velocity data would be necessary , we argue that v12 is a cluster member since the correction from interstellar reddening places this star in the cepheid instability strip at about 1 magnitude above the hb .",
    "although v12 is about 5 arcmin away from the cluster center , it has been noted by clement et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the cvsgc ( 2012 update ) that the star is within the tidal radius of ngc  6333 of @xmath17 8 arcmin .",
    "v12 also follows the p - l relation of acs pulsating in the fundamental mode of pritzl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . while acs are common in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. pritzl et al . 2002 ; 2005 ; nemec et al .",
    "1994 ) , they are rare in globular clusters ; only four are presently known , v19 in ngc 5466 ( zinn & dahn 1976 ) and three in @xmath63 cen ( kaluzny et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we argue that v12 in ngc 6333 is an ac .    among the rr lyrae stars",
    "we have identified the double mode or rrd nature of v19 and the secular period changes in v14 and v18 at the rates of 4.67 and 11.5 d myr@xmath64 respectively .",
    "we stress that similar to ngc 5024 ( arellano ferro et al .",
    "2012 ) , ngc 6333 has a rather large number of blazhko stars among the rrc population .",
    "a deep search for variability among the blue stragglers in the cluster was conducted but none was found . if sx phe stars do exist in the cluster they must be of amplitudes smaller than the detection limit of our data .    the fourier decomposition of the light curves of 9 rrab and 7 rrc stars was performed and individual values of [ fe / h ] , @xmath41 , @xmath65 , @xmath47 and stellar mass and radius were calculated using ad hoc semiempirical calibrations .",
    "the weighted mean values of the iron abundance of selected stars gives a cluster mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath23 in the zinn & west ( 1985 ) scale or [ fe / h]@xmath66 in the scale defined more recently by carretta et al .",
    "the weighted mean values of the absolute magnitude of the rrab and the rrc stars lead to a distance of @xmath6 and @xmath59 kpc respectively . in calculating these distances the heavy differential reddening affecting the cluster",
    "was taken into account by using the detailed reddening map of alonso - garca et al .",
