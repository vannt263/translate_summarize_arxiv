    "the notion of quantum entanglement plays a key role in the current study of quantum information and quantum computation theory .",
    "there are two main criteria to distinguish entanglement from separable states : the ppt criterion @xcite tells us that the partial transpose of a separable state is positive , that is , positive semi - definite .",
    "the converse is not true in general by a work of woronowicz @xcite who gave an example of a @xmath2 ppt entangled state .",
    "such examples were also given in @xcite for the @xmath0 cases , in the early eighties .",
    "another complete criterion was given by horodecki s @xcite using positive linear maps between matrix algebras , and this was formulated as the notion of entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the duality theory @xcite between positivity of linear maps and separability of block matrices , through the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism @xcite . through this isomorphism ,",
    "an entanglement witness is just a positive linear map which is not completely positive .",
