    "we aim at drawing attention to today s asymptotically fastest known algorithms for computing with polynomial matrices . in particular , we shall focus on the following problems : compute the _ rank _ , a right or _ left nullspace _ , the _ determinant _ , the _ inverse _ and a column- or _ row - reduced form _ of a given polynomial matrix .",
    "polynomial matrices are quite common in the analysis of multivariable linear systems and kailath s treatise _ linear systems _",
    "@xcite is a good illustration of this .",
    "recently , algorithms have been designed  @xcite that allow to compute solutions to these problems in essentially the same amount of time as when multiplying two polynomial matrices together .",
    "more precisely , given a field @xmath0for example the complex numbers , the rationals or a finite field  and given a polynomial matrix @xmath1^{n \\times n}$ ] whose entries have degree in @xmath2 bounded by @xmath3 , these algorithms allow to compute @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and to row - reduce @xmath7 in @xmath8 operations in @xmath0 , and to compute @xmath9 when @xmath7 is generic in @xmath10 operations in @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the best known asymptotic bound for multiplying two matrices in @xmath11^{n \\times n}$ ] of degree @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath12 is the exponent of matrix multiplication over @xmath0  ( * ? ? ? * chapter 15 ) . using schoolbook matrix multiplication",
    ", we have @xmath13 and the bound @xmath8 becomes @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the soft - o notation @xmath14 simply indicates some missing logarithmic factors of the form @xmath15 for three positive real numbers @xmath16 . by achieving the complexity estimate @xmath8 ,",
    "these algorithms improve upon all the complexity estimates that were known previously .    in this paper ,",
    "evidence is given that the key tools for such improvements are :    * minimal bases of @xmath11$]-modules ; * expansion / reconstruction of polynomial matrix fractions .",
    "the former has the same flavour as in  @xcite while for the fractions we heavily rely on the concepts in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "two kinds of minimal bases , namely _ approximant bases _ and _ nullspace bases _ , are studied in section  [ sec : approx ] . there",
    "we will see that such bases are small enough to be computed fast , that is , in @xmath8 operations in @xmath0 .",
    "polynomial matrix fractions are matrices @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the field of rational functions over @xmath0 . by expansion of @xmath19 ,",
    "we thus mean a power series expansion @xmath20^{n \\times n}$ ] and by reconstruction of @xmath19 we mean a left or right quotient of polynomial matrices like @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that all we need is truncated expansions and reconstructed quotients of rather low degree , both of which can be computed fast as seen in section  [ sec : fractions ] .",
    "the key idea here is that an _ approximant _ of sufficiently high order  with respect to the input problem  may lead to an _ exact _ solution over @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "this is well - known in computer algebra , at least for scalar rational functions  @xcite , but as far we know the extension to the matrix case is more recent  @xcite .",
    "minimal bases and matrix fractions are interesting not only because they can be computed fast , but also  and , perhaps , mainly  because computing a minimal basis and expanding / reconstructing a matrix fraction are problems to which we can reduce all other problems like _ rank _ , _ left nullspace _ , _ determinant _ , _ generic inverse _ and _ row - reduced form_. the goal of section  [ sec : applis ] is precisely to show this : there the above problems are thus seen as applications of the techniques studied in sections  [ sec : approx ] and  [ sec : fractions ] .",
    "if we assume given an @xmath8 algorithm for multiplying two @xmath23 by @xmath23 polynomial matrices of degree @xmath3 , combining the reductions of section  [ sec : applis ] with the cost estimates of sections  [ sec : approx ] and  [ sec : fractions ] then yields @xmath8 solutions to all our problems under consideration .",
    "of course , we could have introduced a cost function @xmath24 for polynomial matrix multiplication and derived more precise complexity estimates for each of the problems , in terms of ( functions of ) @xmath24 .",
    "however , we prefer for this paper to stick to the more readable @xmath8 bound , which already gives a good sense of the link with polynomial matrix multiplication",
    ".    a first task remaining would be to relax the regularity assumptions made for _ inversion _ ( the input should be generic and of dimensions a power of two , see section  [ subsec : appli_inv ] ) and for _ row - reduction _",
    "( the input should be non - singular , see section  [ subsec : appli_rowred ] ) .",
    "but even these `` generic '' situations are enough for our purpose here of showing how to rely on minimal bases and matrix fraction expansions / reconstructions .",
    "also , recently , other problems on polynomial matrices than those treated in this paper have been shown to have about the same complexity as polynomial matrix multiplication .",
    "an example is the problem of computing the _",
    "smith normal form _ and thus also the determinant , whose solution in  @xcite gives us theorem  [ theo : expansion ] .",
    "however  and this is the second task remaining , the list of problems that can be solved in about the same number of operations as for polynomial matrix multiplication still has to be augmented .",
    "the question is particularly interesting for the problem of computing the _ characteristic polynomial _ and the _ frobenius normal form _ , for which the best known solutions  @xcite have cost @xmath25 still greater than @xmath26 .",

    "for example , @xmath36^{n \\times m}$ ] of degree @xmath3 has size at most @xmath37 .",

    "our solutions for solving a class of polynomial matrix problems in about the same number of operations in @xmath0 as for multiplying two polynomial matrices will fundamentally rely on computing minimal bases of @xmath11$]-modules .",
