    "more recently , a general theory of quantum resources , similar to that of entanglement but based on the degree of coherence of a quantum system with respect to a given reference basis , was proposed @xcite .",
    "thus , entanglement and coherence provide a means to capture the degree of quantumness of a given quantum system .",
    "in particular , spin systems constitute paradigmatic examples of strongly interacting many body systems which enable to study in detail the previous issues , providing at the same time a convenient scalable scenario for the implementation of quantum information protocols .",
    "interest on spin systems has been recently enhanced by the significant advances in control techniques of quantum systems , which have permitted the simulation of interacting spin models with different type of couplings by means of trapped ions , josephson junctions or cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "accordingly , interacting spin systems have been the object of several relevant studies .",
    "entanglement and discord - type correlations @xcite in spin chains with heisenberg couplings under uniform fields were intensively investigated , specially for spin @xmath7 systems @xcite .",
    "the effects of non - uniform fields have also received attention , mostly for spin @xmath7 systems @xcite , although some results for higher spins in non - uniform fields are also available @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze in detail the effects of a non - uniform magnetic field on the entanglement and coherence of a spin-@xmath1 pair interacting through an @xmath0 coupling , both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "we examine the interplay between the non - uniform magnetic field and temperature and their role to control quantum correlations .",
    "we also study the critical behaviour and the development of different phases as the spin increases , when the field , temperature , and coupling anisotropy are varied .",
    "analytical rigorous results are also provided . in particular",
    ", the @xmath5 phase diagram will be characterized by ground states of definite magnetization @xmath8 , all reachable through non - uniform fields for any value of the couplings , with entanglement decreasing with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "special critical points will be discussed . on the other hand , the limit temperature for entanglement",
    "will be shown to depend . for any value of @xmath1 , only on the difference between the field applied at each spin , leading to a thermal phase diagram characterized by a separability stripe in field space .",
    "finally , we will analyze the relative entropy of coherence @xcite in the standard basis , which coincides here exactly with the entanglement entropy at @xmath5 but departs from entanglement as @xmath6 increases .",

    "the limit condition for entanglement and non - zero negativity of a spin @xmath1 pair with an @xmath0 coupling in a non - uniform transverse field at temperature @xmath3 , depends only on the field difference @xmath242 .",
    "this result applies also to any coupling independent of the field that commutes with the total spin along @xmath19 ( @xmath243=0 $ ] ) .",
    "_ proof : _ we first rewrite the hamiltonian of a spin @xmath1 pair in a non - uniform field as @xmath244 where @xmath245 denotes the ( field independent ) interaction between the spins , assumed to satisfy @xmath246=0 $ ] ( @xmath20 ) . the first term in ( [ h2 ] ) is the uniform field component and commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the thermal state for average field @xmath247 , @xmath248 , can be written as @xmath249 where @xmath250 depends just on @xmath242 and commutes with @xmath251 .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) implies that @xmath252 will be separable , i.e. , a convex combination of product states @xcite , _ if and only if @xmath250 is separable _ : if @xmath253 , with @xmath254 and @xmath255 local mixed states , then @xmath256 with @xmath257 also local mixed states , so that it is separable as well . similarly , @xmath252 separable implies @xmath250 separable ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "hence , the limit condition for exact separability depends only on @xmath242 .",
    "let us now consider the negativity .",
    "the non - zero matrix elements of @xmath252 are @xmath259 .",
    "its partial transpose will then have matrix elements @xmath260 , such that it can also be written as @xmath261 although @xmath262 will no longer commute with @xmath251 , @xmath263 will be positive definite ( i.e. , with positive eigenvalues ) if and only if @xmath262 is positive definite , since @xmath264 is positive definite and @xmath265 , @xmath266 are positive .",
    "this result demonstrates the lemma for the negativity .",
    "more explicitly , the onset for non - zero negativity occurs when the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath267 becomes negative , implying a vanishing eigenvalue at the onset , i.e. , @xmath268=0 $ ] .",
    "but eq .  ( [ t2 ] ) implies @xmath269= ( \\frac{z_0}{z_h})^{(2s+1)^2}{\\rm det } [ \\rho_{12}^{t_2}(0)]$ ] ( as @xmath270 ) , so that the critical conditions at @xmath271 and @xmath224 are equivalent .",
    "in addition , for an @xmath0 coupling as well as for any coupling invariant under permutation of the spins , the limit condition will obviously depend only on the _ absolute value _",
    "@xmath2 of the field difference , as those for @xmath4 and @xmath272 should be identical .    therefore , even though the negativity for the @xmath0 pair does depend on the average field @xmath247 ( through the relative weights of the distinct eigenstates ) , as was seen in previous figures , the limit temperature for non - zero negativity at fixed exchange couplings , and the threshold values of @xmath17 or @xmath16 for non - zero negativity at fixed temperature , will depend just on @xmath2 . in the @xmath233 field plane",
    ", the set of zero negativity states will then be stripes , i.e. , typically a stripe @xmath239 .",
    "of course , @xmath197 can be exponentially small outside the stripe , but not strictly zero .",
    "the previous features of the relative entropy of coherence remain also valid .",
    "the standard basis of states @xmath160 continues to be the schmidt basis for definite magnetization eigenstates , i.e. latexmath:[$|\\psi_m\\rangle=\\sum_{m}c_m    coherence will approach the gs entanglement entropy ( for a non - degenerate gs ) adopting qualitatively the same form as the @xmath5 negativity .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath6 increases the @xmath5 steps will become rapidly smoothed out in the coherence , without exhibiting minima or valleys .",
    "it will also rapidly occupy the @xmath5 separable sectors , becoming in particular prominent along the line @xmath55 for @xmath72 , as seen in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ f9 ] . on the other hand , for sufficiently high temperatures if will approach a uniform decay pattern for all @xmath1 .",
    "a series expansion for @xmath274 leads to @xmath275}{2 d\\ln 2}=\\frac{1}{9\\ln 2 } \\left(\\frac{s(s+1)j}{kt}\\right)^2\\,,\\label{cas}\\ ] ] where the first result holds in a system of finite dimension @xmath276 and the last one is the leading asymptotic expression for a spin @xmath1 @xmath0 pair .",
    "it reproduces the leading term of previous asymptotic results ( [ cha ] ) and ( [ cap1 ] ) .",
    "we have discussed in detail the entanglement and coherence of the @xmath0 spin @xmath1 pair in a transverse non - uniform field at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the general spin @xmath1 case exhibits interesting features which can already be seen in the basic @xmath29 case . in the latter ,",
    "while the @xmath5 diagram in the field plane is characterized by an @xmath36 entangled region bounded by hyperbola branches , reachable through non - uniform fields even in the fm case @xmath72 , the thermal state is characterized by a _ separability stripe _ @xmath108 in the @xmath277 field plane for _ any _ @xmath3 , with the system becoming pure and entangled for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "analytic expressions were provided .",
    "remarkably , these features were shown to remain strictly valid for any value of the spin @xmath1 .",
    "the boundaries of the @xmath5 entangled sector are given by the same expressions with a simple rescaling , while the conditions for non - zero thermal entanglement and negativity were rigorously shown to depend just on the field difference @xmath2 for any @xmath1 , entailing that for @xmath3 strict separability will still be restricted to a stripe @xmath278 .",
    "the main difference with the spin @xmath7 case is the emergence of @xmath200 magnetization and entanglement steps at @xmath5 , which lead to deep valleys in the negativity at low temperatures but which disappear as @xmath6 increases .",
    "another interesting aspect emerging for non - uniform fields for increasing spin is the appearing of a critical point along the line @xmath55 , which determines the onset of gs entanglement for @xmath72 and where all @xmath227 gs s with magnetizations @xmath279 coalesce .",
    "the relative entropy of coherence in the standard basis approaches the entanglement entropy for @xmath131 , although for @xmath280 it stays non - zero for all fields .",
    "the exact asymptotic expression for high @xmath6 was derived , which shows that it ultimately decays uniformly as @xmath281 for sufficiently high temperatures .    in summary ,",
    "the present results show that the @xmath0 pair in a non - uniform field is an attractive simple system with potential for quantum information applications .",
    "its entangled eigenstates , having definite magnetization , admit a variable degree of entanglement which can be controlled by tuning the fields at each spin .",
    "moreover such tuning enables to select the magnetization of the gs at @xmath5 for any anisotropy , while at @xmath3 it allows one to effectively cool down the system to an entangled state . at @xmath5 entanglement",
    "itself can be detected and approximately measured through the magnetization , since it decreases with increasing @xmath8 and vanishes just for maximum @xmath8 .",
    "the possibility of simulating @xmath0 systems with tunable couplings and fields by different means enhances the interest in this type of models .",
