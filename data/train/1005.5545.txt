    "the key resource for quantum communication @xcite is entangled pairs ( epr pairs ) of particles distributed over large distances . typically photons are used to encode and transport quantum bits ( qubits ) over long distance due to their relative insensitivity to decoherence .",
    "however the optical channels suffer from exponential loss and the resulting rate of generation of remote epr pairs can be vanishingly small . in the last ten years , schemes for extending the range of quantum communication have been proposed @xcite using quantum teleportation , i.e. , state teleportation and entanglement swapping .",
    "@xcite one crucial component for these schemes is efficient bell - state analysis .",
    "the bell - state analyzer ( bsa ) makes a joint measurement on an incoming unknown qubit and one particle of an epr pair and projects the two - qubit state onto one of the four bell states . knowing which bell state they are in allows the state of the remote particle of the epr pair to be rotated to match the state of the unknown qubit , thus performing state teleportation .",
    "if the unknown qubit is one partner in a remote epr pair , the entanglement now extends between another two remote partner particles , which is entanglement swapping .",
    "simple but inefficient bsas can be built using linear optics . for polarization - entangled photons ,",
    "this consists of a 50/50 beam splitter and two polarizing beam splitters ( pbs s ) based on two - photon interference .",
    "@xcite this standard optical bsa can identify only two of the four bell states , so the corresponding teleportation is probabilistic ( at most @xmath0 efficient ) .",
    "@xcite a further more damaging limitation is that this bsa relies on the synchronous arrival of two indistinguishable photons at the beam splitter .",
    "both photons will have suffered loss and the probability for both arriving at the same time will be the product of these losses , which is typically much less than @xmath0 .    in order to capture and link all photons that arrive at the bsa , a quantum memory is needed with some form of heralding to announce the photon arrival . in this way a photon arriving in one side of the system is stored until another arrives from the other side , at which point the two photons pass to a complete efficient bsa .",
    "multi - link systems based on this approach can have a throughput of photons limited only by the losses of a single link independent of the number of links .",
    "however the fidelity of entanglement generated will be limited by the product of the fidelities of the individual links and would eventually drop below the threshold where the entanglement is useful .",
    "this can be remedied by integrating entanglement purification into a repeater as first introduced by briegel et al .",
    "@xcite to distribute entanglement with loss now a polynomial function of distance .    in this work",
    ", we present a device that incorporates a complete bsa with heralded single photon memory to provide a loss - resistant repeater .",
    "the corresponding quantum teleportation is efficient ( or deterministic in the ideal case ) , heralded and loss resistant .",
    "the device is based on a charged quantum - dot ( qd ) carrying a single spin coupled to an optical microcavity , and exploits the photon - spin entangling gate that can be achieved in this system .",
    "@xcite this device can be extended to include entanglement purification and we will report on this aspect elsewhere .",
    "compared with the standard optical bsas based on two - photon interference,@xcite our bsa has three main advantages : ( 1 ) indistinguishability and synchronization of photons are not required as we exploit the spin coherence rather than the photon coherence .",
    "quantum teleportation is heralded by the sequential detection of two photons at different arrival time , and is finished after the spin measurement .",
    "( 2 ) it measures all bell states ( is complete ) and is loss - resistant . both features , especially the latter , can largely enhance the efficiency .",
    "our bsa has a built - in spin memory , so the time window for it to collect photons is determined by the spin coherence time which is in the ns or @xmath1s range , several orders of magnitude longer than the temporal overlap of photons ( typically @xmath2ps ) in standard optical bsas . as a result , the signal rate or the distance for quantum communication can be significantly enhanced .",
    "it is well known that a complete deterministic bsa using linear optics only is impossible .",
    "@xcite although complete bsas using optical @xcite or measurement - based @xcite nonlinearities are possible , they often suffer from low efficiency .",
    "search for complete and efficient bsas is always a big challenge in the field of quantum information science .",
    "@xcite the efficiency of our bsa can be @xmath3 in the ideal case , and @xmath4 in a realistic device with current technology .",
    "we show in this work that this complete and efficient bsa could be implemented with current technology .",
    "( 3 ) it is versatile . besides bsa",
    ", the spin - cavity unit can also work as various entangling gates , photon - spin interface ( spin memory ) , spin - controlled single photon source , and quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "@xcite the compatibility with standard semiconductor processing techniques allows all these functions integrated onto a chip .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the type - i bsa using a single qd - spin in a single - sided cavity with its application for state teleportation . in sec .",
    "iii , various experimental challenges in implementing this device are discussed .",
    "we calculate the bsa fidelity and efficiency in more realistic cavities .",
    "results show that the bsa can work in both the weak coupling and strong coupling regime , but high efficiencies and high fidelities are achieved when the side leakage and cavity loss is low .",
    "we also introduce a spin manipulation method using single photons and its potential application to spin echo schemes to prolong the spin coherence time which limits the storage time of the intrinsic spin memory . in sec .",
    "iv , we show entanglement swapping using the type - i bsa . in sec .",
    "v , the type - ii bsa using a single qd - spin in a double - sided cavity is presented with its applications for state teleportation and entanglement swapping .",
    "finally , we make our conclusions .",
    "the optical selection rule of negatively or positively charged excitons ( i.e. , the trion @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) in qds enhanced in a cavity - qed system leads to large differences in phase or amplitude of reflection / transmission coefficients between two circular polarisations of photons .",
    "this giant circular birefringence ( gcb ) increases with increasing qd - cavity coupling strength and could be observed in both the strong and the weak coupling regime .",
    "the gcb applications for quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement , various entangling gates , photon - spin interface , and spin - controlled single photon source have been discussed in our previous work .",
    "@xcite    here we consider a qd - confined electron spin in a single - sided microcavity ( type - i ) with the top mirror partially reflective and the bottom mirror @xmath3 reflective . in this spin - cavity system",
    ", gcb can manifest as the phase difference in the reflection coefficients between @xmath7 and @xmath8 photons . by suitable detuning of the photon frequency",
    ", the phase difference can be adjusted to @xmath9 and thus a photon - spin entangling gate can be developed , which is described by a two - qubit phase shift operator @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are right - circular and left - circular photon polarization states , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the spin eigenstates along the optical axis , i.e , photon input / output direction . if the side - leakage and loss rate @xmath13 is lower than the output coupling rate @xmath14 , near unity reflectance can be achieved for the empty cavity at all frequencies and for the trion - coupled cavity around the central frequency region in the strong coupling regime , @xcite so the gate is deterministic in this ideal case and we will discuss the details in sec .",
    "note that the two - qubit phase gate is different from the controlled - z ( cz ) gate , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "this can be easily seen by checking their matrix representations , which are @xmath16 for our gate , if the input state is @xmath17 or @xmath18 , it induces a phase shift of @xmath19 on the output state ; if the input state is @xmath20 or @xmath21 , it has no effect on the output states . for the controlled - z gate ,",
    "only if the input state is @xmath21 , it induces a phase shift of @xmath22 on the output state , but has no influence otherwise . due to the side leakage and the cavity loss ,",
    "it is hard to achieve a phase shift of @xmath22 in a realistic cavity - qed system .",
    "@xcite however , the condition for the @xmath19 phase shift is actually achievable in a realistic system with losses as discussed in sec .",
    "it is worthy to point out that our phase gate exploits the coherent photon - spin interaction in the linear region , therefore it is very different from other quantum phase gates based on kerr nonlinearity in the nonlinear region .",

    "given the losses the arrival of photon 1 should be heralded before photon 2 .",
