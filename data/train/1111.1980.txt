    "in a @xmath0sr experiment the muon - spin precession frequency @xmath1 can be used to deduce the local magnetic field @xmath5 at the muon site .",
    "if there are a number of muon sites with different local fields @xmath6 , then the @xmath0sr signal can contain a number of components with frequecies @xmath7 .",
    "in complex systems it can be highly non - trivial to determine the precise location of the muon site or sites . however , it is nevertheless useful to attempt to extract an estimate of the magnitude of the moment of the magnetic species producing the local field , even in the face of ignorance of the location of the muon site or sites . in this paper",
    "we describe a method to attempt this using bayesian inference .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sections 2 and 3 we review the theory of dipolar fields and bayes theorem respectively to provide the necessary background to the calculation which is described in section 4 .",
    "an implanted muon spin precesses around a local magnetic field , @xmath8 , with a frequency @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . the magnetic field",
    "@xmath8 at the muon site is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the applied field ( zero in the experiments considered here ) , @xmath13 is the dipolar field from magnetic ions , @xmath14 is the lorentz field , @xmath15 is the demagnetizing field from the sample surface and @xmath16 is the contact hyperfine field caused by any spin density overlapping with the muon wavefunction . in antiferromagnets",
    "the lorentz and demagnetizing fields vanish ( in polycrystalline ferromagnets they cancel to some extent ) .",
    "the contact hyperfine field is hard to estimate but we will neglect it .",
    "the remaining term is the dipolar field @xmath17 and is a function of the muon - site @xmath18 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath19 a sum over the magnetic ions ; the magnetic moment of the @xmath20th ion is @xmath21 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : localfield ] ) , @xmath22 is the dipolar tensor given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the kronecker delta ( @xmath26 if @xmath27 , else @xmath28 ) .",
    "the behaviour of this tensor is dominated by the arrangement of the nearest - neighbour magnetic ions and leads to a non - zero local magnetic field for almost all possible muon sites , even in an antiferromagnetically ordered system @xcite .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : localfield ] ) is taken over the infinite lattice , but it is well known @xcite that this sum converges in such a way that it is necessary only to sum over points inside a sphere centred on @xmath18 with sufficiently large radius .",
    "an alternative method of calculation is provided by the method of ewald summation ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we recap some elementary probability theory @xcite . the _ conditional probability _ @xmath29 is the probability that event @xmath30 occurs _ given _ that event @xmath31 has happened . the _ joint probability _",
    "@xmath32 is the probability that event @xmath30 and event @xmath31 both occur .",
    "the joint probability @xmath32 is equal to the probability that event b occurred multiplied by the probability that a occurred , given that b did , i.e. , @xmath33 and , equally well , @xmath34 now consider the case where there are a number of mutually exclusive events @xmath35 such that @xmath36 then we can write the probability of some other event x as @xmath37 in very general terms , one can say that given some hypothesis h there usually exists some computational strategy to evaluate the probability of a particular outcome o assuming that hypothesis to be correct ( i.e. , there is some method to compute the quantity @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , what you often want to do is the reverse of this : you know the outcome because it has actually occurred and you want to choose an explanation out of the possible hypotheses . in other words , given the outcome you want to know the probability that the hypothesis is true , and the problem is that @xmath39 is typically much more challenging to evaluate .",
    "the needed transformation of @xmath38 into @xmath39 can be accomplished using _ bayes theorem _ ( named after thomas bayes ( 17021761 ) , although the modern form is due to laplace ) .",
    "this theorem can be stated as follows : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is called the _ prior probability _ , since it is the probability of @xmath30 occurring without any knowledge as to the outcome of @xmath31 .",
    "the quantity which you derive is @xmath42 , the _",
    "posterior probability_. the proof of bayes theorem is very simple : one simply equates eqs .",
    "( [ eq : acapb1 ] ) and ( [ eq : acapb2 ] ) and rearranges . for the purpose of this paper , we will write bayes theorem using eq .",
    "( [ bayessum ] ) as @xmath43",
    "since the positive muon seeks out areas of negative charge density , constraints can be placed on the likely location of stopped muons . for example , the muon is unlikely to stop close to the positively charged ions in a system . in many oxides ,",
    "muons have been shown to stop around @xmath44 from an o@xmath45 ion  @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "we assume a magnetic moment @xmath0 on the magnetic species in our material and consider a particular magnetic structure .",
    "positions in the unit cell are then generated at random and , provided the relevant constraints are satisfied , the dipole field is calculated at each of them .",
    "after many such randomly generated positions , one obtains a distribution of dipole fields .",
    "( this distribution sometimes have sharp features associated with them which are van hove singularities @xcite . ) the magnitudes of the resulting dipole fields are then converted into muon precession frequencies , and the resulting histogram yields the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath4 , evaluated as a function of precession frequency @xmath1 divided by magnetic moment @xmath0 ( since the precession frequency scales with the magnetic moment ) .",
    "this function @xmath4 allows us to evaluate @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayes ] ) . we can write @xmath47 the function @xmath4 is normalized so that @xmath48 , and hence the factor of @xmath49 is needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayesexpression ] ) so that @xmath50 .",
    "an example of this approach is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) for a cubic lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled spins .",
    "the solid line shows the case when a simple constraint is applied so that the muon is not permitted to stop at a site closer than a particular critical distance to the magnetic moments , resulting in a cut - off of the tail at high frequency .",
    "( with antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath51 ) .",
    "the lattice parameter is @xmath52 and the size of the moment is @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) line shows the distribution with a cut - off ( not ) applied .",
    "( b ) the extracted pdf for the moment given a particular observed frequency ( @xmath53 ) . ]    since @xmath1 is obtained from a real experiment , what we would like to know is @xmath3 , the pdf of @xmath0 _ given _ the observed @xmath1 .",
    "this can be obtained from our calculated @xmath4 using bayes theorem in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayes ] ) , which yields @xmath54 where we have assumed a prior probability [ @xmath55 for the magnetic moment that is uniform between zero and @xmath56 , and so @xmath57 is replaced by the uniform probability density @xmath58 [ which cancels on the top and bottom of eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) ] .",
    "we choose @xmath56 to take a large value , although we have found that our results are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath59 .",
    "a very simple example of this approach is shown in fig .",
    "when multiple frequencies @xmath60 are present in the spectra , it is necessary to multiply their probabilities of observation in order to obtain the chance of their simultaneous observation , so we evaluate @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the error on the fitted frequency .",
    "we have now applied this technique to @xmath0sr data a variety of real systems in which the muon site is not known .",
    "these include ba@xmath63naoso@xmath64 in which we can show from the observed precession frequencies that the magnetic ground state is most likely to be low - moment ( @xmath65@xmath66 ) ferromagnetism and not canted antiferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "we have also used it to show a reduced moment in the two - dimensional molecular magnet [ cu(hf@xmath63)(pyz)@xmath63]bf@xmath68 @xcite and in the pnictide superconductor nafeas @xcite . in all these cases",
    "we do not have a priori information concerning the muon site but can nevertheless place bounds upon the magnetic moment from the observed precession signal using this technique .",
    "a possible drawback that should be borne in mind is that the hyperfine contribution to the local field is neglected and if this is significant it could affect the conclusions drawn .",
    "as many of the systems examined so far using this technique have localized , reduced moments and lower - frequency precession signals , it is probable that the hyperfine contribution is not significant in these cases .",
