    "the applications of glycol - water fluids is in the biomolecular field , physical chemistry , and engineering , from protein dynamics to power production and storage devices technology . in this paper a theoretical model for nanometer scale or mesoscale interacting fluids",

    "the theory is a semi - classical interacting potential theory which utilizes effective potentials such as of the lennard - jones type .",
    "the statistical distributions of the fluids are derived from information theory and temperature dependent distributions are obtained for the lennard - jones potential interactions of the fluids .",
    "the full description of the fluids of water and glycol would require a fully quantum mechanical theory .",
    "such a theory exists and will be briefly discussed in the derivation .",
    "however for practical applications , simplifications of the computation required to model the biomolecular dynamics of glycol - water are sought .",
    "simplifications are possible and are motivated by the success of lennard - jones molecular dynamics of fluids and biomolecular interactions , at nanometer scales .",
    "such models the utilize lennard - jones type of potential interactions for example are incorporated in computational molecular dynamics such as the namd nanomolecular dynamics source code free distributions of the university of illinois molecular dynamics of biomolecules project @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model will be derived for the two fluids as independent fluids . then the interacting binary fluids model will be developed and discussed .",
    "the resulting statistics will be numerically simulated and compared with experimental results published by researchers that have conducted detailed experimental studies of glycol - water interactions .",
    "the glycol interacts with water by hydrogen - oxygen bonding .",
    "the water is attracted to the oxygen atoms and hydrogen bonds are formed in the case of ethylene oxide adducts dissolved in water . @xmath0 a 1980 study by steuter , mozafar and goodin @xcite also has shown that some of the ethylene adducts in aqueous solutions may be present as cation - active polyoxonium compounds @xmath1^+ } { ( oh)^- } }        \\end{matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these two types of reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) co - existing in an equilibrium",
    "water is a fluid that is the universal solvent of nature .",
    "it is a fluid at standard temperature and pressure .",
    "the fluidity of water is of a complex arrangement of dipole - dipole interactions of the polar molecule .",
    "water has a triangular shape with a bend angle of @xmath2 .",
    "water is comprised of @xmath3 connected by covalent bonds and forms hydrogen bonds readily with most molecular material .",
    "water can be described by a hamiltonian for fluids .",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of the hydrogen hamiltonian and the oxygen hamiltonian and the interacting hydrogen - oxygen potential .",
    "the hydrogen potential is @xmath4 @xmath5 the gaseous atoms due to attraction form molecular bonds and become @xmath6 . to illustrate the more complex interactions and the method of description we discuss the interaction formalism and the phase transition theory , which we will apply to the more complex @xmath7 in a similar approach , and to the glycol molecular fluid and the glycol - water binary fluid . ",
    "the hamiltonian for hydrogen can be written as a matrix @xmath8 where we have partitioned the hamiltonian , a freedom we have in this and in all subsequent work , to include the free electron and electron - electron interaction as @xmath9 , similarly for the free proton and proton - proton interaction , and the interactions between the electron - proton as the off diagonal interaction terms .",
    "note that the electron - proton interaction is of negative sign , a potential that lowers the energy to a more stable configuration , and also that the off diagonal terms are hermitian conjugates and transposes of each other .",
    "the hydrogen molecule is then described by the long range order parameters , the diagonal dlro parameter useful for observables such as the number of electrons and protons , as @xmath10 , and the off - diagonal odlro useful for interacting formation of hydrogen and hydrogen molecular gas as @xmath11 .",
    "these are obtained from the retarded and advanced @xmath12 green s functions of the hamiltonians , which are for example for the electrons @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an infinitesimal that shifts the singular denominator such that outgoing ( retarded ) wave solutions for example are obtained . also , the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath15 is a temperature dependent distribution that is a step function at zero temperature and is a limit on the energy integration @xmath16 by the dispersion relation .",
    "other observables , such as energy @xmath17 and rates of reaction can also be obtained from this matrix formulation and the odlro as the derivative of the time dependent observables as @xmath18 .",
    "the phase transition of the molecular hydrogen is described by another matrix interaction , the interaction being of the fluid and the lattice phases for example .",
    "writing the green s functions matrix as @xmath19 the hamiltonians are simplified hydrogenic hamiltonians @xmath20 , and the lattice hamiltonian is shifted by constant wave vectors corresponding to the lattice periodicity , geometry and symmetry as @xmath21 .",
    "the fluid phase hamiltonian is similar as the lattice hamiltonian however the constancy of the lattice vector is relaxed to @xmath22 a variable .",
    "other simplifications are possible , such as solid phase tight binding hamiltonians , metallic effective mass hamiltonians .",
    "the formation of water is a similar interaction description from this formulation of many - particle physics of interacting atoms and molecules and phase transitions .",
    "the formation of the water molecule in the fluid phase is approached from the gaseous or vapor phase for definiteness .",
    "the hydrogen gas of hydrogen atoms and @xmath6 molecules is for example allowed into an oxygen environment and the two gases interact as due to oxygen s effective electron affinity .",
    "the matrix green s function for the formation of water @xmath23 vapor then is written as @xmath24 and the hamiltonians are written as discussed with the appropriate symmetry , approximation as needed to the required accuracy desired .",
    "the fluid phase is obtained as before , with the hamiltonians including interaction terms of the phase symmetry , @xmath25    the hamiltonians are of interactions between the vapor - fluid phases , and the interactions are of the gas potential with the fluid potential vectors with the quasi - periodic lattice vectors shifted by the variable vector @xmath26 and here this denotes that a vapor particle is created at @xmath27 and propagated through the system , interacting with the fluid particle of @xmath28 the two particles then being removed at their final momentums of @xmath29 respectively and here we have written the fluid symmetry wave vector explicitly .",
    "the description of water from the fully quantum mechanical can be simplified .",
    "an indication of this was already given when we discussed the level of accuracy , approximations utilized to achieve this accuracy , such as the use of hydrogenic wave functions , tight binding hamiltonians , effective mass hamiltonians ... an approximation that can be made is an approximation of the dynamics as quantum effects become screened .",
    "as the number of atoms and molecules increases , the screening that occurs makes it less necessary to describe the interactions at the fully quantum mechanical description .",
    "the description of the interactions can be made then as semi - classical interactions .",
    "the most well - known of theses descriptions being the lennard - jones potential and its generalization @xmath30 description of interactions , which is a screened coulomb potential with the pauli exclusion principle accounted for by the infinite amount of energy needed for two particles to occupy the same space , this being a mathematical description of repulsion of a sort .",
    "the lennard - jones potential is further simplified by the approximation by a harmonic oscillator potential in the vicinity of the minima of the potential well .",
    "however this approximation we consider as not being of sufficient accuracy to describe the dynamics of the fluid phase of water , and the subsequent description of the dynamics of glycol .",
    "nanofluid droplets and the physics of fluids at the nanometer scale and at the meso scale between the fully quantum mechanical and the classical continuum of hydro - dynamics have been described reasonably successfully in the literature by semi classical methods @xcite .",
    "the approaches have been to classically treat the nanofluid droplet by approximate hydrodynamic means , the vapor by boltzmann equation , and to evolve the number of particles and obtain rates of change in number of particles .",
    "approximations are made such as boltzmann equation @xcite collision terms of a certain order , an example is the force collision terms up to a third order expansion by @xcite .    in hydrodynamics approaches , full analytic solutions",
    "are not obtained to the hydrodynamic equations ... approximations of linearization and similar assumptions for solution are made such as in @xcite , examples of approximations are of viscosity and compressibility .",
    "another approach between the hydrodynamic approximation and the quantum mechanical dynamics of the mesoscale is possible . given the success of recent molecular dynamics simulations in describing experimental results , approximating the nanofluid as a lennard - jones fluid , this approach seems reasonable .",
    "then a similar theory of multi - phase fluid - vapor can be made at the lennard - jones approximation level that is applicable in between the range of applicability of the boltzmann and hydrodynamics equations scale of applicability and the fully quantum mechanical dynamics .",
    "that is , from the hundreds of atoms to the micrometer scale . from an analogy to the fully quantum mechanical phase transition theory discussed in the previous section",
    ", a theory of coexisting phases of nanofluid droplets can be obtained .",
    "the advantages would be the simultaneous description of co - existing phases by analogy to the matrix formulation discussed , long range order parameter approach as in the diagonal trace and summation to obtain particle or number of atoms in the individual phases .",
    "a theoretical advantage of the full quantum theory aside from increased accuracy at the cost of increased computation time is the generality of the theory and the well known hamiltonian superposition principle that allows us to include external perturbations and interaction terms and which allows us to write a theory of phase transitions as a superposition of interactions between the co - existing phases . from the point of view of the approach of lennard - jones fluids coexisting phases",
    "theory , the superposition principle is replaced by the legendre transform of the maximum entropy method of theory derivation , and equivalently the information theoretic method .",
    "alternatively a lennard - jones semi classical lagrangian or hamiltonian may be used , and dynamics with or without a heat bath computed .",
    "the heat bath dynamics implying fluctuations and therefore stochastic dynamics , equivalent descriptions made by fokker - planck equations can be obtained .",
    "these are analogous to the quantum mechanical green s functions schroedinger - like equations and can therefore be written in matrix form for the co - existing phases .",
    "we derive our theory utilizing the entropy maximization method .      the entropy state function or information measure to be used we choose to be the gibbs - boltzmann entropy , @xmath31 which can be generalized to the nonextensive entropy of c. tsallis @xcite for better accuracy in future work .... also other novel effects such as the q - parametrization of the deviation of the pdf from the gaussian to the power - law pdf can be advantageously made for simple interacting nonlinear dynamics .",
    "note that nonlinearity due to physical interactions deviates the pdf from the gaussian distribution towards the power - law distribution .",
    "the nonextensive statistics has been noted for theoretically producing this form of power - law distribution from a formally similar mathematics to the traditional thermodynamics and information theory .",
    "the connections are more profound and review articles and applications can be found at @xcite .",
    "the maximum entropy approach is then of the maximization of the entropy measure constrained with observables of the system in a legendre transform with lagrange multipliers setting the weighted units to the entropic measure s .",
    "the choice of observables is one of choosing the minimum set of observables that describe the physics of interest .",
    "these observables are described mathematically as functions of the other observables chosen as representative of the observable dynamics of the system .",
    "a discussion of this was made by the original author of maximum entropy theory @xcite e. t. jaynes .",
    "we choose observables analogous to the quantum mechanical observables in the fully quantum mechanical theory .",
    "the momentum or kinetic energy observables of quantum mechanics correspond to the first and second moments of the variables of position , the potential energy or interaction potential terms are similarly included here though we choose the lennard - jones potential and not the coulomb potential , the observable moments are : @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41^+ ( oh)^- ) } } > = \\sum \\limits_{i , s}^{n_{h},n _ { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } }   < ( { \\frac{\\sigma_{{h}- { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } } { { r_{is}}^{\\mu } } }   - { \\frac{\\eta_{{h}- { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } } { r_{is}^{\\nu } } } ) > \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these observables of free particle movement of trajectories and thermal fluctuations and electromagnetic interactions as described by the semi - classical potentials of a lennard - jones type whose semi - classical approximation is general enough to have force constants that can be determined from experiment or alternative theoretical derivation .",
    "the interaction between particles of atoms forms water , and ions of hydroxide and molecules of @xmath6 and @xmath42 and interacting @xmath7 molecules and interactions of water molecules with the glycol s ether oxygen atoms here denoted by species @xmath43 .",
    "the maximization of entropy is made with the lagrange multipliers setting appropriate units for the observables as @xmath44+\\delta[\\beta(a_h { _ h}m^2 + ..... + a_{{h}- { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } < v_{{h}- { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } > ] = = 0 $ ] which derives the least biased distribution matrix for binary interactions @xmath45^+ ( oh)^- ) } } } } \\\\   { ..... } \\\\{ .... }\\\\{ .... }\\\\ { { p_{{h}- { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } } \\;\\ ; { .... } \\;\\ ; { .... } \\;\\ ; { ... } \\;\\;{p _ { { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } - { ( [ y]^+ ( oh)^- ) } } }   } \\end{matrix } } \\right )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we will specialize this to the simple case of fluid water solvent and dissolved ether , the steps in derivation thus far being instructive as how to proceed .",
