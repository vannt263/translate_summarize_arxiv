    "in recent years there has been a surge of interest on energy efficient `` green communication '' systems , primarily arising out of environmental and cost concerns due to the every increasing power consumption of cellular systems @xcite .",

    "most of this improvement is expected to be achieved through , i ) network densification ( i.e. , more base station nodes per unit area ) , ii ) increased system bandwidth ( e.g. usage of mmwave spectrum ) and iii ) massive mimo @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in studying the energy efficiency of massive mimo based cellular systems .",
    "massive mimo systems/ large mimo systems/ large scale antenna systems collectively refer to a communication system where a base station ( bs ) with @xmath0 antennas ( several tens to hundred ) communicates coherently with @xmath1 users ( few tens ) on the same time - frequency resource @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "large antenna arrays at the bs helps in realizing beamforming gains which significantly improves the energy efficiency ( ee ) .",
    "the spectral efficiency energy efficiency tradeoff of massive mimo systems has recently been studied in @xcite . however , in @xcite only the power consumed by the power amplifiers ( pa ) at the user terminals ( ut ) has been considered . with large @xmath0 the total power consumed by the @xmath0 rf receivers at the bs becomes significant and must therefore be taken into consideration @xcite . in @xcite the ee of massive mimo systems is maximized w.r.t .",

    "it is shown that the ee of uplink mimo systems can be optimized by selectively turning off antennas at the ut . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors optimize the ee of downlink massive mimo systems with respect to ( w.r.t . )",

    "they however do not analytically characterize the effect of changing system parameters on the optimal ee .",
    "also , no analytical condition ( in terms of the system parameters ) has been proposed to decide as to when the system must operate in the massive mimo regime and when not .    in this paper",

    "this is referred to as the massive mimo regime and is studied in section [ subsec_smallrho ] .",
    "we specifically consider those scenarios where the number of users is limited to a few tens , since the channel rank is anyways limited by the amount of physical scattering .",

    ", our analysis of the ee suggests that for a fixed @xmath3 and fixed power consumption parameters , the optimal ee decreases with increasing cell size .",
    "interestingly , due to varying @xmath2 , this decrease is found to be significantly less than the decrease in ee when @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "a similar phenomenon is observed when the cell size is fixed , but the pcps decrease proportionately ( e.g. , due to technology scaling ) . numerical results presented in section [ sec_sim ] are observed to support the analytical results derived in other sections .",
