    "when and how the first episodes of star formation took place remains one of the main questions of modern cosmology .",
    "much effort has been devoted to measuring the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) of the universe as a function of redshift or look - back time initially at ultraviolet wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and more recently in the millimeter and radio regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . unlike ultraviolet or optical wavelengths , radio emission at .5ex  1  ghz is unaffected by dust , which eliminates the need for uncertain extinction corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the conversion of radio luminosity to sfr depends on canonical scaling relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) which may not apply to star formation at high redshift .",
    "primordial star formation occurs in chemically unenriched environments . besides the high - redshift @xmath16  absorption systems which are very difficult to study , the only examples we have of such environments are nearby metal - poor galaxies actively forming stars , such as the class of galaxies known as blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) . unlike solar - metallicity star - forming regions , the radio emission in these objects tends to be predominantly thermal rather than non - thermal @xcite .",
    "low - metallicity bcds also tend to be of low mass .",
    "hence , they may represent the primordial `` building blocks ''  or `` sub - galaxies '' @xcite  in hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "as such , the study of their radio properties can be useful to better understand primordial galaxies .",
    "one of the best candidates for the primordial building - block status is sbs0335@xmath0052 . at @xmath171/41 @xmath18  @xcite ,",
    "it is the lowest - metallicity star - forming galaxy known after izw18  ( @xmath171/50 @xmath18 ) .",
    "its mass in stars is @xmath19@xmath20  @xcite , and it is embedded in an  hi  cloud of @xmath21@xmath20  @xcite . to explore the radio properties of star formation in a chemically unenriched interstellar medium , and to better understand the nature of the starburst in sbs0335@xmath0052",
    ", we have obtained very large array ( vla ) d - array observations at five continuum frequencies . in this paper , we first describe in some detail the extremely metal - poor bcd sbs0335@xmath0052 .",
    "we then present the new radio observations and their reduction and analysis in @xmath22[observations ] , together with a description of the optical - radio alignment .",
    "models of the continuum emission and the results of the spectral fitting are discussed in @xmath22[models ] and @xmath22[results ] , respectively . in @xmath22[sfr ] we examine the properties of the starburst in sbs0335@xmath0052 , as inferred from our observations , and assess the nature of the non - thermal radio source .",

    "there is an indication that the non - thermal spectral index is steeper than the canonical @xmath85 , since the lowest value of @xmath86 ( 1.37 ) was obtained with model 2 by fixing @xmath87 . however , while this result is formally a slightly better fit than that we obtain with @xmath85 , with such a steep @xmath50 the other geometries give substantially worse fits .",

    "these values , although extreme , are similar to the magnetic field strength and pressure estimated for the compact sources in m82 @xcite .",
    "although magnetic fields in very active star - forming galaxies tend to be much stronger than in less active galaxies such as the milky way @xcite , we can not be certain that such a high value for the magnetic field in sbs0335@xmath0052  is correct .",
    "first , the source may be too young to have achieved the minimum - energy configuration ( see @xmath22[nonthermal ] ) .",
    "second , the standard formula for magnetic field strength relies on a fixed integration interval in frequency . in the case of sbs0335@xmath0052 , with its relatively high non - thermal radio luminosity , this procedure is almost certainly inappropriate .",
    "a fixed frequency interval corresponds to different electron energy intervals , because of the dependence on magnetic field strength @xcite . using the correct formula , and integrating from a proton energy of 300mev to infinity",
    ", we obtain an equipartition field of 30@xmath39 g ( r. beck , private communcation ) , similar to the field strengths of other bcds @xcite .",
    "the results from the spectral fits allow us to separate thermal and non - thermal emission in sbs0335@xmath0052 . from the thermal emission , we can then derive the number of ionizing photons , the star - formation rate , and the supernova rate .      with a thermal flux of @xmath109mjy at 5ghz , the inferred thermal luminosity @xmath110=@xmath111whz@xmath9 . because of the high electron temperature in sbs0335@xmath0052 , the usual scaling for ionizing photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) give inconsistent results .",
    "we therefore provide in the appendix a new set of relations which are valid to within 0.5% for 10000k@xmath11220000k .",

    "it is clear that the @xmath10  is powered by between two and five times the ionizing photons responsible for the thermal radio emission .",
    "either our estimate of the thermal fraction is wrong , or there is a source of ionized gas emission in addition to the  hii  region associated with the sscs .",

    "the @xmath10  flux inferred from the thermal radio continuum , @xmath129 erg@xmath14s@xmath9 , is a factor of @xmath130 times lower than what we would expect from an optically thick wind ( see above ) .",
    "moreover , it is less than half the observed value of @xmath126 erg@xmath14s@xmath9 , which is a lower limit because of the extinction correction .",
    "it is evident that in sbs0335@xmath0052  there is an excess of @xmath10  flux over what we would expect from a simple  hii  region .",
    "the hot massive stars of the arches cluster in the galactic center show a similar , if more extreme , excess ; comparing the radio emission @xcite to the near - infrared recombination line flux @xcite shows that the @xmath10  luminosity is more than 20 times greater than expected from a case b  hii  region extrapolated from the radio .",
    "the thermal radio emission can also be used to derive the massive star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "first , using the formulation given in the appendix , valid for high temperatures , and assuming that @xmath131 , @xmath132k , and @xmath133 , from @xmath110  we derive the @xmath38  luminosity @xmath134ergs@xmath9 .",
    "then , following @xcite , we estimate the sfr of stars more massive than 5@xmath20  sfr@xmath135@xmath20yr@xmath9 .    the _ total _ sfr including less massive stars is @xmath136@xmath20yr@xmath9 , about half the value estimated by @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the near - infrared recombination line flux is apparently partly due to stellar winds ; consequently , numbers of massive stars and star - formation rates inferred from the near - infrared recombination lines are overestimated .",
    "we can infer the total stellar mass in the cluster , assuming an age and a population synthesis model . for an age of 5myr @xcite , and with starburst 99 @xcite",
    ", the number of o7v stars given by the thermal radio luminosity in sbs0335@xmath0052  corresponds to a total stellar mass of 2.4@xmath137@xmath20 .",
    "this is very close to the total stellar mass of 2@xmath137@xmath20  estimated by @xcite on the basis of the integrated infrared spectral energy distribution , but is 3 times lower than that of @xcite .",
    "again , this last discrepancy is because of the @xmath10  excess described above .",
    "non - thermal radio emission can be used to estimate the star - formation rate in sbs0335@xmath0052 , provided it follows usual scaling relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we investigate this assumption , and use our observations to determine the origin of the non - thermal radio emission in sbs0335@xmath0052 .",
    "given the sfr@xmath138 , we can estimate the supernova ( sn ) rate @xmath139 . almost independently of the form of the initial mass function , @xmath139@xmath140yr@xmath9 .",
    "with sfr@xmath135@xmath20yr@xmath9 , @xmath139=@xmath141yr@xmath9 .",
    "this is only 34 times smaller than the recent estimate of 0.016yr@xmath9 for m82 @xcite , and the type ii sn rate of the galaxy , 0.023yr@xmath9 @xcite , which however are galaxies over 1000 times more massive .",
    "we can also use the relations given in @xcite for normal galaxies to deduce the non - thermal radio luminosity @xmath142  we would expect from a typical starburst with this @xmath139 . in sbs0335@xmath0052 , predicted @xmath142  is @xmath143whz@xmath9 , corresponding to an expected non - thermal flux @xmath144mjy at 5ghz .",
    "this value is very close to the model fit value of 0.600.68mjy at 5ghz .",
    "it is puzzling why the scaling relation derived for massive spiral galaxies with evolved starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) would hold for sbs0335@xmath0052 .",
    "non - thermal radio emission in spiral galaxies is almost certainly produced by relativistic electrons diffusing over the galactic disk .",
    "the timescale for this diffusion on kpc scales is @xmath15yr @xcite . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "although sne almost certainly accelerate initially the electrons responsible for non - thermal emission we observe , @xmath14590% of it was produced long after the discrete sne have faded out .",
    "the starburst in sbs0335@xmath0052  is very young , 5myr or younger @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that the diffusion mechanism active in the majority of spiral galaxies has had enough time to operate in sbs0335@xmath0052  to produce the observed amount of non - thermal emission .",
    "the dimensions of the radio source as implied by the models are also inconsistent with the standard diffusion picture .",
    "the non - thermal source can not be larger than the beam width ( fwhm@xmath11400 pc ) , and almost certainly is at least 10 times smaller than this given the constraints imposed by the spectral fit .",
    "this size is 50100 times smaller than that of the diffuse kpc - scale radio emission mechanism which powers normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we therefore investigate possible sources of non - thermal emission which are both spatially compact and develop on a short timescale . on the very shortest timescales ( @xmath146yr ) ,",
    "the non - thermal radio emission in sbs0335@xmath0052  could come from a single radio sn seen at a time not long after its explosion .",
    "the inferred @xmath142@xmath147whz@xmath9 is not unusual for radio sn @xcite , but because of the rapid decline of radio emission on timescales of decades , we must be observing it not long after it occurred .",
    "however , the lack of radio variability over the 9-yr period spanned by our observations and those in @xcite suggest that this interpretation may not be the best one .",
    "alternatively , on slightly longer timescales , the non - thermal radio emission in sbs0335@xmath0052  could arise either from radio sne or evolved sn remnants .",
    "radio sne have adiabatic lifetimes of @xmath148yrs @xcite , and from the @xmath139  derived above , we can estimate the radio luminosity we would expect from a population of these ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from radio sne that emit only during the adiabatic phase of their evolution",
    ", we would expect at 5ghz @xmath142=3.5@xmath149whz@xmath9 ; this is _ 6 times smaller _ than the observed @xmath142=@xmath143whz@xmath9 at 5ghz .",
    "the non - thermal source in sbs0335@xmath0052  is therefore difficult to interpret as an ensemble of standard radio sne .",
    "finally , the radio source in sbs0335@xmath0052  could be interpreted as one or more evolved compact sn remnants similar to those observed in m82 @xcite . as proposed by @xcite",
    ", such remnants could be interacting with a dense interstellar medium , with @xmath150@xmath6 , similar to the @xmath89 we derive for sbs0335@xmath0052 .",
    "the timescales for this radiative phase are longer than the pure adiabatic lifetimes @xcite , and , given the intense starburst and massive sscs in sbs0335@xmath0052 , we could expect to detect sources with properties similar to those in m82 . since @xmath139  in sbs0335@xmath0052  corresponds to roughly 1 sn every 54yr , it would not be unlikely for a few of these to be visible at the current epoch . as mentioned before ,",
    "the equipartition pressure and magnetic field in sbs0335@xmath0052  are similar to those in m82 .",
    "the physical dimensions of such compact sources are @xmath151pc @xcite , so they could conceivably reside inside the 30pc diameter region responsible for the thermal emission and absorption .",
    "the non - thermal flux of sbs0335@xmath0052  placed at the 3.63mpc distance of m82 would be @xmath152mjy , similar to the flux of the most luminous of m82 s compact sources , and equivalent to the flux of a few to ten or so of the less luminous ones .",
    "@xmath104  in sbs0335@xmath0052  is only 4 times higher than the most luminous source in m82 , and comparable to the predictions of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that a few compact evolved remnants , similar to those observed in m82 as well as other starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , could be responsible for the non - thermal radio emission in sbs0335@xmath0052 .",
    "vlbi and high - resolution x - ray observations are necessary to verify this hypothesis .",
    "indeed , chandra observations of sbs0335@xmath0052  show evidence for a compact point source roughly spatially coincident with the compact non - thermal radio source we find here , and associated with the two brightest sscs @xcite .",
    "the x - ray source is extremely luminous in the 0.5@xmath08.0kev range ( @xmath153ergs@xmath9 ) , and would be classified as an ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) if it is a single object .",
    "the nature of the radio@xmath1x - ray emitting object is however not clear . whether the x - ray source is a single ulx or several high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrbs ) is impossible to judge with the chandra resolution .",
    "but while there are more than a hundred hmxrbs in our galaxy @xcite , only @xmath1545% of these are radio emitters @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray luminosity is similar to that expected from a microquasar associated with a medium - mass black hole , its radio luminosity well exceeds ( by @xmath155 ) that observed in other such objects @xcite . also its non - thermal radio spectrum is much steeper than the flat spectra thought to be characteristic of black hole systems in the low / hard spectral state @xcite .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , there is no evidence for either radio variability over a 9-yr interval or x - ray variability over shorter timescales , although the limited photon statistics do not strongly constrain the temporal nature of the x - ray source @xcite .",
    "hence , the radio source and the x - ray one could be physically distinct objects , the non - thermal radio luminosity coming from evolved snrs expanding in a dense medium , and the x - ray luminosity from a single ulx or several hmxrbs . independently of the specific nature of the compact object(s )",
    "responsible for the x - ray and radio emission , it is evident that they are connected to the sscs and the starburst episode which formed them .",
    "there are two noteworthy features of the radio continuum in sbs0335@xmath0052 , relative to spectra of normal spiral galaxies or other bcds .",
    "first , there is significant free - free absorption on a global scale , of sufficient amplitude to suppress by a factor of 4 or more the observed flux at 1.49ghz .",
    "second , while the spectrum of sbs0335@xmath0052  is significantly different from those of normal spirals , it is not completely thermal as in other bcds . at 5ghz , we find roughly a 30 - 70 mix of thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "if sbs0335@xmath0052  can be taken as representative of star formation in an extremely low - metallicity environment , care should be taken when deriving cosmological conclusions from present and future radio continuum surveys .",
    "because of the young age , low metal abundance , and intensity of the starburst , galaxies like sbs0335@xmath0052  may not obey the usual scaling laws laid out in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effects of free - free absorption substantially alter the spectrum at frequencies @xmath1561.5ghz",
    ". it would not be straightforward to disentangle such an effect when deriving the sfr as a function of redshift .",
    "young starbursts occurring in a metal - poor , but dusty and dense environment , have integrated radio properties that may be very different from those of evolved starburst prototypes such as m82 and arp220 . as a result , photometric redshifts inferred from `` standard '' spectral - energy distributions could also be incorrect .",
    "we have presented new vla continuum observations of the extremely metal - poor bcd sbs0335@xmath0052 , and fit the spectrum to a variety of models .    * the best - fitting model ( model 2 ) , which assumes an absorption medium intermixed with thermal@xmath1non - thermal emission , gives an @xmath157pc@xmath3 and a diameter of the radio - emitting region of 17pc . the inferred density is @xmath5@xmath6 . *",
    "the non - thermal fraction at 5ghz is 0.7 , with an unabsorbed non - thermal 5ghz flux of 0.68mjy , corresponding to @xmath142=2.2@xmath158whz@xmath9 . from this",
