    "various beyond the standard model ( bsm ) theories predict a host of new heavy particles at the tev range .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is searching for many of these particles . in a hadron collider like the lhc",
    ", a heavy colored particle could be produced via different mechanisms . among them ,",
    "usually the strong interaction mediated pair production dominates .",
    "other direct production processes like single productions generally depend on some model specific couplings ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , many present direct searches for new colored particles at the lhc ( and related phenomenological studies ) focus on their pair productions and ignore single productions assuming the couplings controlling them to be smaller than the strong coupling . with this assumption",
    "the results ( or predictions ) seemingly become model independent .",
    "but this , however , raises a question  is it justified to ignore single production completely ?",
    "obviously , the question is relevant if any such ignored @xmath0 is indeed not very small in the nature .",
    "but , even if @xmath0 is small , cross - sections of some single productions could still be comparable to the pair production cross - section in some region of parameter - space .",
    "this is possible when the particle being produced is quite heavy so that the extra phase - space suppression received by the pair production is significant .",
    "hence , at present when no signatures of these new particles have been found and , as a result , the direct search experiments are regularly pushing the lower limit of the allowed masses of these new particles upwards , the question gets increasingly important .    in this paper , we want to illustrate that assuming single productions to be negligible compared to pair production may be unnecessary ( or even improper ) in some cases .",
    "in fact , including single productions in the theory estimation might give us extra clues about the bsm models being probed .",
    "we shall use the example of the recent leptoquark ( lq ) search by cms @xcite to indicate how single productions can be systematically included in this search for pair production of scalar lqs and demonstrate how the extracted exclusion limits ( els ) on parameters ( like masses , branching fractions ( bfs ) etc . )",
    "change in presence of model dependent production processes with similar final states as the pair production which could potentially ` contaminate ' the signal simulations .",
    "+ lqs are hypothetical color - triplet bosons ( scalars or vectors ) that also carry lepton quantum numbers .",
    "hence , a heavy lq can decay to a lepton and a quark .",
    "they appear in different bsm theories like the pati - salam models @xcite , su(5 ) grand unified theories @xcite , models with quark lepton compositeness ( see e.g. @xcite ) , colored zee - babu model @xcite etc . in some supersymmetric models squarks can also couple to a quark and a lepton via some r - parity violating couplings @xcite and thus have similar phenomenology to the lqs .",
    "the leptons in their decay states make their collider signature relatively clean compared to that of other colored particles that dominantly decay hadronically . at the lhc ,",
    "searches for lqs have been going on for quite some time .",
    "both atlas and cms have put limits on lq masses @xcite .",
    "recently , cms collaboration has reported the results of their searches for the first generation scalar lqs at the 8 tev lhc with 19.6 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "they have searched for pair production of lqs in two different channels ",
    "i ) the @xmath2 channel where both lqs decay to electrons and jets and ii ) the @xmath3 channel where only one lq decays to an electron and a jet while the other one decays to a neutrino and a jet .",
    "they have found a mild @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) excess of events compared to the standard model ( sm ) background in the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) channel for lqs with mass ( @xmath6 ) around 650 gev .",
    "the excesses observed certainly make the lq search more interesting to be investigated further @xcite .",
    "the analysis also puts 95% cl els on first generation scalar lqs for @xmath7 gev for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bf for a lq to decay to an electron - quark pair .    here",
    ", we take a closer look at the cms analysis and investigate lq single production processes that could give potentially significant contribution to the signal @xcite but were ignored in the analysis . in the next section ,",
    "we specify the single production processes under consideration , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sig_sim ] we present the phenomenological lq models and discuss the method that we use to compute single productions , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results and finally , in the light of the new results we further clarify our argument and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the limits from hera data @xcite roughly indicate that the generic ( scalar ) lq - lepton - quark coupling , @xmath10 could even be larger than 0.5 if @xmath11 gev .",
    "however , the cms analysis assumes that @xmath10 is small enough to ignore all lq single productions and sets @xmath12 to compute the total decay width of a scalar lq for the signal simulations . in the leading order ( lo ) of couplings ,",
    "the pair production of lqs is almost independent of @xmath10 ( see figs . [",
    "fig : gg2ss1 ] - [ fig : qq2ss1 ] ) except for the @xmath13-channel lepton exchange contribution whose amplitude is proportional to @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uu2ss2 ] ) . for small @xmath10",
    ", this contribution is actually quite small , e.g. with @xmath15 it amounts to only about 5 percent of the @xmath10 independent contribution to the lo pair production cross - section for @xmath16 gev ( see table [ tab : sigma ] ) .",
    "this is why it is justified when the @xmath14 contribution is ignored in refs .",
    "@xcite to compute the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross - sections for the pair production ( used in the cms analysis ) .",
    "however , while it may be safe to ignore the @xmath13-channel lepton exchange contribution to the pair production for @xmath15 , we shall see that even with this value of @xmath10 , single production of lqs could actually contribute quite significantly to the analysis .",
    "the important point here is that a fraction of the single production events would pass the signal selection cuts used in the cms analysis and contribute to their estimations of pair production events .",
    "for example , in the @xmath2 channel , the analysis considers @xmath17 ( the curved connections above or below mark a pair coming from the decay of a leptoquark , @xmath18 ) and hence demands the presence of exactly two electrons and at least two jets in the selection .",
    "however , for non - zero @xmath10 , any @xmath19 process could also contribute to the signal .",
    "hence , _ a priori _ , these should also be included in the signal simulations .",
    "since the cms analysis requires at least two jets for event selections , the following two types of hard processes with 3-body final state can contribute :    1 .",
    "born single production with radiation ( br1 ) : the born diagrams for @xmath20 ( as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ug2se1 ] & [ fig : ug2se2 ] ) can not directly contribute to the cms search but with the emission of a qcd radiation ( we refer to both parton splitting and radiation simply as ` radiation ' ) they contribute at @xmath21 .",
    "new subprocess of three - body single production ( ns3 ) : it originates at @xmath22 and includes diagrams for @xmath23 that do not count as br1 single production ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : qq2sej1]-[fig : ug2sej1 ] for example ) .",
    "as already stated , cms assumes that a generic first generation scalar lq decays to an electron and a quark with a bf @xmath9 and a neutrino and a quark rest of the time .",
    "hence , we also adopt a parametrization in which a lq decays to a @xmath24 pair via a coupling @xmath25 with bf@xmath26 and to a @xmath27 pair via @xmath28 with bf@xmath29 , and take _",
    "e^2 = _ e ^2=^2,_^2 = _ ^2=(1-)^2 , so that for any @xmath9 , the total decay width remains fixed at , _ _ q = m__q + m__q = m__q , i.e. , the expression used in the cms analysis . motivated by the experiment , we consider scalar lqs that couple with only first generation quarks and take two simple lagrangians for scalar lqs with electromagnetic charge , @xmath30 ( model a ) and @xmath31 ( model b ) respectively , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electron chirality fractions , i.e. , @xmath35 gives the fraction of electrons coming from a lq decay that are left - handed ( right - handed ) . in other words , @xmath36 is the bf for a lq to decay into a left - handed ( right - handed ) electron and a quark . as the experiment is insensitive to the polarization of electrons , for simplicity and without loss of any generality , we have set @xmath37 = 1 for our computation .",
    "the above models are completely generic and as long as no distinction is made between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , they can act as templates for a wider variety of lqs that can decay to sm quarks and leptons .",
    "for example , an analysis done in model a for the @xmath2 channel separately will also be applicable for a lq with charge @xmath40 that couples to a @xmath41-type quark and an electron ( but not to a neutrino ) .",
    "similarly , the lq from model b can represent a charge @xmath42 particle also .",
    "moreover , these models could be connected to the ones generally found in literature ( see e.g. , @xcite ) via parameter rescaling .    with these models ,",
    "we have performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for the lq single productions in both @xmath2 and @xmath43 channels ( as long as the lq width remains small , we ignore the interference between single and pair production ) . for our simulations",
    "we have employed madgraph5 @xcite ( and pythia6 @xcite within it ) to generate and shower events and delphes 3 @xcite to simulate the cms detector environment and implement the selection cuts .",
    "we have used cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite for all our numerical computations .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      following the cms analysis , we set @xmath44 to generate the signal events from the single productions in the @xmath2 channel . unlike the pair production , events from the lowest order single production process ( strictly born diagrams ) will not pass the final event selections as they will have only one jet in the final state . at the parton level , one could roughly estimate the ( potential ) contribution to the @xmath2 channel coming from the inclusive single production ( @xmath45 ) by computing the cross - section for pp  ( _ qe j )  ej e j without including the pair production diagrams .",
    "this will include contributions from both br1 and ns3 single production processes .",
    "but the br1 process contains divergent pieces that get cancelled when loop diagrams ( virtual correction to born diagrams ) are properly included .",
    "the picture becomes clear if we express the cross - section for the inclusive single production with two electrons in the final state as ,    ^ee_s = _ small  contribution  +   _ main  contribution  +  , [ eq : softhard ]    where the neglected terms are of higher order than @xmath46 and the superscripts ` soft + collinear ' , ` soft ' or ` hard ' refer to the nature of the extra jet .",
    "notice that , just like the ` pure ' born process , the pieces with divergence ultimately contribute very little to the experiment ( if only parton showers are included ) because it demands two separated ` hard ' jets ( see the selection criteria in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in a tree level calculation , one could put some minimum @xmath47-cut on the second jet ( the jet coming from the lq is generally the hardest one ) to avoid the small - contributing part .",
    "this way one could compute the cross - section , but it would then become a function of the @xmath47-cut and hence ambiguous ( since _ a priori _ there is no absolute way to choose the ` ideal ' @xmath47-cut ) and unsuitable for our purpose .    clearly , a better approach would be to consider loop diagrams consistently to compute the @xmath48 processes upto nlo qcd level ( keeping the hard radiation ) including the ns3 contribution to compute the inclusive single production cross - section ( @xmath45 ) correctly upto @xmath49 without any ambiguity .",
    "we are at present working in this direction @xcite but for this paper we employ matrix element - parton shower matching ( me@xmath50ps ) technique to obtain a theoretical estimate of the inclusive single production cross - section without any arbitrary @xmath47 cut on the second jet .",
    "the main difference between a proper nlo qcd computation and our me@xmath50ps computation will come from the part that contributes very little ( from the second and third terms of eq .",
    "[ eq : softhard ] ) .",
    "hence , for the same luminosity , the number of events passing the selection criteria ( require atleast two jets with @xmath51 gev ) @xcite should not vary too much between a proper loop included nlo level computation and the one with me@xmath50ps . the estimates for the inclusive cross - section will be different but this difference should not matter if the efficiencies of the selection cuts ( will be defined in sec .

    "one must be careful while interpreting our results since they are obtained by simple rescaling , not a full statistical analysis .",

    "@xcite underestimates the mass els .",
    "this is just a manifestation of the fact that the reach of the lhc ( to probe new particles ) can increase if multiple production channels are systematically combined ( we have already demonstrated this while estimating the lhc discovery reach for leptogluons which also decay to @xmath104 pairs like lqs @xcite , support of this argument can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while it can be argued that the pair production gives the most conservative estimation of els on mass of lqs ( or any colored particles ) , but , as we have seen , it can be misleading about other parameters like the branching fraction , @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , by ignoring single productions completely , one also ignores the fact that the pair production data is not only excluding masses of new particles but also putting limits on new couplings . for lqs , the limits on @xmath10 thus obtained are competitive with the ones obtained from hera observations @xcite .",
    "our nave estimates indicate that compared to the limits from hera , the cms data already provides better limits ( both in terms of lower limits on @xmath6 and upper limits on @xmath10 ) for the entire parameter range covered in fig .",
    "[ fig : lm_mass_exclusion ]",
    ".    the results also support our argument that for any fixed @xmath10 , the els depart more and more from the pair production ones as @xmath6 increases . hence",
    ", if single productions must be ignored , it also has to be made certain that within the whole mass range probed , the single productions remain small enough and the choice of @xmath10 should reflect this .",
    "alternatively , the selection - cuts could be optimized in such a way that they disfavor single productions strongly .",
    "but , rather than making any assumptions like this , our suggestion is to include single productions in the signal simulations and allow @xmath10 to vary as much as the existing experimental limits allow .",
    "moreover , if the selection cuts could also be optimized so that they do _ not _ disfavor the single productions unnecessarily , then it may be possible to impinge more on the presently allowed parameter space due to increased sensitivity to @xmath10 ( also see e.g. refs .",
    "also , advanced techniques ( like multivariate analysis ) could tell us more about parameters other than the mass . this way , from the same experiment , we might learn more about the underlying model than a conservative mass exclusion of lqs .",
    "so far our discussions have been mainly centred on the example of lqs .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the argument in favour of including single productions is applicable for many other bsm particle searches . generally , if there is no symmetry that prevents model dependent production ( like r - parity prevents single production of supersymmetric particles ) , ideally all such productions that could ( potentially ) contribute to their search should also be considered . at",
    "the core of our argument stands the very simple and well known statement  _",
    "ideally _ , all processes that can have similar final states should be included in the signal simulations .",
    "however , _ in practice , _ one often has to make simplifying assumptions like , if there are too many processes to produce a new particle that could contribute to its search , usually the ` sub - dominant ' ones are ignored , or if there are different new particles that can have similar signals , generally only one is considered at a time etc . here",
    ", we are simply trying to suggest that when making such simplifying assumptions one should justify them _",
    "quantitatively _ to the extent possible and , moreover , if technology permits one need not make any ` unnecessary ' assumptions .",
    "for example , in the context of lqs , for very large @xmath6 ( say @xmath105 1500 gev ) there is no experimental bound that prevents @xmath10 from being order one .",
    "hence , while probing such masses one need not set @xmath10 to be very small .",
    "similarly , as our estimation suggests , a dedicated search for single production of lqs at the lhc should also consider the possible contribution from pair production .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that while searching for new colored particles at the lhc , one need not always consider model dependent ( single ) and ( mostly ) model independent ( pair ) productions separately .",
    "it may be unnecessary to ignore single productions compared to the pair production in some cases .",
    "single productions can obviously be important if the couplings controlling them are not small  this is why the studies that focus on single productions generally consider large couplings ( see @xcite for an example in the context of lq ) - but even if one assumes the couplings to be small , single productions can still contribute significantly if the mass of the particle being probed is sufficiently high .",
    "in such a case , by ignoring single productions navely , one might conclude wrongly about parameters like branching fraction etc . with the example of the recent search for pair production of scalar lqs performed by cms ,",
    "we have illustrated how the contribution from single productions can be included in the analysis and how it can lead to modified limits on the lq - mass .",
    "in addition to this , inclusion of model dependent single productions gives us new information about model couplings like the lq - lepton - quarks couplings from the same experimental data . for this purpose ,",
    "we have proposed two generic models for scalar lqs that can act as templates for a wider variety of lqs and can accommodate the experimental data easily . applying similar logic ,",
    "we have also demonstrated how the pair production could affect bounds obtained from the more recent cms search for lqs in single production channels .",
    "finally , we have pointed out that our arguments are not specific to the case of lqs ( which we have used as an illustrative example ) , but they are applicable to other bsm searches too .",
