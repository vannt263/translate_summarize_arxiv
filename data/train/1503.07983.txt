    "the polar angle , @xmath12 , measures the @xmath13 _ bp _ twisting around the molecule backbone , with @xmath14 being the number of _ bps _ per helix turn and @xmath15 is the twist number accounting for the coiling of the individual strands around the helical axis @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angle , @xmath16 , defines the bending between adjacent _ bps _ along the stack . as the polynucleotide chain has a direction due to the chemistry of the intra - strand bonds , a distribution of values for the twist ( @xmath17 ) and the bending ( @xmath18 ) of the first _ bp _ in the sequence is weighed in the computation .",
    "the fluctuational orbits defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 overlap consistently with the closure condition holding for the dna ring .",

    "i introduce a more general ( albeit more cpu time consuming ) space - time mapping technique , which does not pin a base pair to a specific @xmath25 thus avoiding the somewhat arbitrary partition of the @xmath24 length in @xmath4 intervals :    @xmath26    the paths @xmath27 are expanded in fourier series , the constraint @xmath28 for a dna loop is implemented and , for the model in fig .",

    "the measure @xmath39 is a multiple integral over the path fourier coefficients while @xmath40 indicates that the paths @xmath27 are closed trajectories .",
    "the integration over the two particles potential greatly enhances the computational times with respect to the previous method @xcite but it offers a more realistic model for the base stacking in sequences of any length .",
    "there has been a widespread interest in the properties of small sequences of dna following measurements of high cyclization probabilities which have pointed to an intrinsic flexibility for fragments of @xmath41 _ bps _ or less @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the formation of local disruptions in the helix of dna loops may be the mechanism which permits to release the torsional stress and energetically favors the stability of bent molecules .",
    "certainly , the breaking of some _ bps _ and the opening of fluctuational bubbles change the average pitch of the helix , that is the number of _ bps _ per helix turn .    in the theoretical framework synthesized by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , i compute the free energy ( @xmath42 ) of three heterogeneous loops with different length , @xmath43 , but similar content of at-_bps _ and gc-_bps _ , @xmath44 each .",
    "the rise distance is pinned to the experimental value .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 _ bps _ loops have been prepared as described in ref.@xcite whereas the @xmath47 _ bps _ is a toy sequence here introduced for comparison . for each loop",
    ", we simulate a broad set of values for the twist @xmath15 and , for any @xmath15 ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , @xmath36 is calculated by summing over an ensemble of fluctuational paths representing a large number of molecule configurations , about @xmath49 paths for each base pair in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "hence , the free energy is obtained as a function of the helical repeat @xmath48 .",
    "the computational time for a simulation , e.g. for the @xmath50 sequence , is about eight days on a workstation ( intel xeon e5 - 1620 v2 , 3.7ghz processor ) .",
    "the room temperature results for @xmath51 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "while the shortest loop shows a free energy minimum also at @xmath52 , the minima for all loops are remarkably found for @xmath48 in the range @xmath53 in line with the well known values of helical pitch in dna sequences @xcite .",
    "even more interestingly , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 minicircles also show free energy minima at larger @xmath48 due to a spontaneous unwinding of the complementary strands .",
    "this @xmath15 reduction is consistent with the observations @xcite of _ bps _ disruptions occuring in small loops as a consequence of the strong rotational deformations of the helix .",
    "the bending stress decreases by increasing the radius of the loop .",
    "then , for an ensemble of molecules with @xmath4 _ bps _ , the free energy minimization evaluates the thermodynamically stablest values of helical repeat , that is an average property of the molecule ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the path integral method can also determine the probabilities for the formation of fluctuational bubbles and select those base pairs along the dna sequence for which hydrogen bond breaking is more likely to occur .",
    "by tuning the system temperature and the input parameters which control the counterions concentration in the solvent , we thus obtain a general and reliable computational scheme for the modeling of heterogeneous dna loops in various ambient conditions ."
