    "a fundamental result in the thermodynamics of computation is landauer s erasure principle ( lep ) , which places a lower bound on the average heat dumped to a bath when the information in a memory device is erased .",
    "the principle holds for processes that satisfy two essential features : the process is carried out in the same way independent of the information stored in the device and it restores the device to a known _ standard state _ at the end .",
    "these processes are usually known as the _ landauer erasure _ processes .",
    "landauer has shown that if the device holds @xmath0 bits of information , then during any landauer erasure , the average amount of heat that must be dumped to the bath is at least @xmath1 where @xmath2 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath3 is the temperature of the bath @xcite .",
    "the principle lies at the heart of the resolution of maxwell s demon paradox @xcite , an important factor that stimulates continued interest on the thermodynamics of information processing .",
    "the demon has also been investigated quantum mechanically @xcite . also , several alternative proofs @xcite and generalizations @xcite of lep have been given and different approaches aimed at quantum information processing have been developed @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredient in all alternative approaches to lep is the description of the operation on the device as a unitary transformation on a larger combined system of the device and the bath where initially the two are uncorrelated and the bath is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "unitarity of this transformation is an absolute necessity for all physical operations @xcite while the noncorrelation and equilibrium assumptions are well - suited for all possible experiments .",
    "although this viewpoint is contested @xcite , lep directly follows from the unitarity : in a landauer erasure , the transformation maps different initial device - states to the same final device - state . since the unitary transformation has to be one - to - one , this can only happen if the state of the bath is also modified .",
    "finally , as the bath was initially in equilibrium , changes in its state imply an increase in its energy .",
    "exact calculations then show that the average increase in the energy of the bath must exceed the landauer bound .    can there be further implications of the unitarity of the transformation on the energy exchange with the bath ? a recent article gives an affirmative answer to this question for the case of processes that manipulate classical information @xcite .",
    "that article presents an alternative formulation of lep in terms of the detailed heat transfers into the bath . in this non - entropic approach",
    ", one takes the individual heats dumped to the bath for each initial logical state as the main quantities of interest and places restrictions between them .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is the heat dumped to the bath during a landauer erasure when the initial logical state is @xmath5 , then it can be shown that @xmath6 an inequality which is first derived by szilard @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this formulation is its independence of the coding of the information into the logical states of the device .",
    "the standard statement of lep , however , is dependent on the coding : if the device is used for storing information in such a way that the logical state @xmath5 is used with frequency @xmath7 , then the device has information storage capacity of @xmath8 bits and the landauer bound states that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average heat dumped to the bath when the information in the device is erased .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_avg ] ) is valid for any distribution @xmath11 , hence it provides an infinite number of restrictions on @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_avg ] ) holds for all possible distributions @xmath11 if and only if eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_exp ] ) is satisfied .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_exp ] ) and ( [ eq : classical_landauer_avg ] ) are two equivalent formulations of lep .",
    "the standard form of lep , eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_avg ] ) is more profound as it directly connects two disparate disciplines , thermodynamics and information theory .",
    "yet , eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_exp ] ) is also somewhat attractive as it is a concise inequality that captures all of the infinitely many inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_avg ] ) .",
    "both inequalities can be generalized to arbitrary nondeterministic processes .",
    "it is observed that the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical_landauer_exp ] ) contains further restrictions on heat exchanges that can not be derived from the entropic restrictions of the generalized lep @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to adapt that coding - independent approach to quantum operations applied on devices holding quantum information .",
    "the major difference between the classical and quantum cases is in the description of the state : instead of a discrete index @xmath5 , we now have a density matrix that describes the state of the device .",
    "hence , in place of the numbers @xmath4 , we now have a hermitian operator @xmath12 whose expectation value with the density matrix gives the average heat dumped to the bath",
    ". this operator will be called as the _ heat transfer operator _ ( hto ) .",
    "the unitary transformation can be thought as moving information around in the combined system of the device and the bath .",
    "the resulting information exchange between the device and the bath changes the state and hence the energy of the bath .",
    "the hto essentially provides a measure of this information exchange in terms of the energy given to the bath .",
    "the nature of the operation applied on the device ( e.g. , whether the information in the device is erased completely or only partially , or whether randomness from the bath is introduced to the device or not ) has a strong effect on the hto .",
    "this article investigates that relation between quantum operations and the associated htos .",
    "this relation essentially follows from the unitarity of the transformation on the combined system .",
    "however , it appears that the unitarity property is unnecessarily too restrictive ; all of the results in this article can also be obtained from a weaker assumption , namely that the transformation is an isometry .",
    "this assumption is made throughout the article .",
    "the quantum operation - hto relation is a generalization of the classical lep to the quantum domain and hence it is primarily of theoretical interest .",
    "but , it is possible that this may find some applications as well .",
    "for example , the restrictions on htos can be used as a way to theoretically quantify the `` information erasing nature '' or some other aspect of generic quantum operations .",
    "in addition to this , the current work can also be useful in the design of non - unitary operations ( e.g. , erasures ) on technological implementations of quantum devices .",
    "if the heat emitted during the operation is desired to be minimized , it is necessary to select or adjust the bath levels and the device - bath interaction in a suitable way .",
    "the explicit construction of the erasure operations that appear in this article is appropriate for that optimization task and hence it may be a valuable guide for this purpose .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hto ] , the hto associated with a realization of a given quantum operation is defined .",
    "the nature of the hto and some of its fundamental properties are also discussed in this section .",
    "[ sec : restrictions ] is devoted to the derivation of various restrictions on the htos .",
    "the first one of these is the entropic bound of the generalized lep , which can be expressed for an arbitrary quantum operation .",
    "this bound is a good starting point for the investigation of the coding - independent characterization of quantum operation - hto relation .",
    "after that , quantum operations that completely erase the information in the device are taken up and the associated htos are described .",
    "these results are then used for the description of htos associated with extremal quantum operations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : differences ] , some examples are given for quantum operations that do not completely erase the information content of the device and it is shown that lep is not sufficient for a complete characterization of htos associated with these operations .",
    "this indicates the usefulness of the current approach .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains brief conclusions .",
    "let a be a quantum system with a finite number of levels which is used as a memory device for holding quantum information .",
    "a quantum operation on this system is a trace - preserving completely - positive map @xmath13 that takes the initial state @xmath14 of the device to a final state @xmath15 .",
    "although all quantum operations are within the scope of this article , special attention will be given to those that completely erase all information in the device .",
    "the operation @xmath13 will be called a _ complete erasure _ if the final state is a constant mixed state @xmath16 for all initial states , i.e. , @xmath17 it will be called a _",
    "landauer erasure _ if it is a complete erasure with a pure final state , i.e. , @xmath18 for some @xmath19 .",
    "any quantum operation @xmath13 on a can be realized as a unitary transformation or an isometry @xmath20 on a larger system ab , where b denotes an additional system that will henceforth be called as the bath . it is assumed that the device and the bath are initially uncorrelated .",
    "hence , if the initial state of the bath is @xmath21 , the initial state of the composite system is the product state @xmath22 .",
    "the final states after the application of the isometry will usually be denoted by primes , e.g. , @xmath23 .",
    "we will say that the bath b , the state @xmath21 and the isometry @xmath20 form a _ realization _ of the operation @xmath13 if @xmath24 is satisfied for all @xmath14 , where here @xmath25 denotes the partial trace over b.    it is assumed that the transformation @xmath20 is obtained from the evolution of the composite system ab with a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "the basic assumption about the independence of the process ( i.e. , the hamiltonian and therefore the transformation @xmath20 ) from the information stored in the device is also made .",
    "in particular this means that no measurements are taken on the composite system ab during the process .",
    "hence , during the transformation , any information exchange with a occurs entirely between a and b only and this process is described with the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "no third system is involved in the transformation except in providing the energy for the necessary work done on ab .    for discussing the energetics of the aforementioned transformation , the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath26 of the composite system ab has to be discussed .",
    "the transformation process is assumed to be carried out over a finite time interval , say between times @xmath27 and @xmath28 , during which subsystems a and b couple and @xmath26 is time dependent . outside this time interval , however , it is assumed that the two subsystems are uncoupled and have time - independent hamiltonians .",
    "thus , we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the hamiltonians of the device before and after the transformation respectively and @xmath32 is the bath hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian of the device is not relevant to the main subject of the current article and hence there are no restrictions on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , initial and final hamiltonians of the bath are taken to be identical .",
    "this is also operationally reasonable for realistic quantum operations where the environment corresponds to b ; a quantum operation on a device may perhaps structurally change the device ( so that initial and final hamiltonians may differ ) but it merely couples with the environment without changing it structurally .",
    "finally , no assumptions are made about the strength of the coupling and the hamiltonian @xmath26 during the time interval @xmath33 .",
    "the transformation @xmath20 is the time - development operator corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath26 between two times @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as indicated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_before ] ) and ( [ eq : hamiltonian_after ] ) , it is assumed that a and b do not interact with each other outside the process time interval , @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason , no special values are needed to be assumed about @xmath39 .",
    "however , the results of the current article can also be extended to cases where there is a weak coupling between a and b outside the process time interval . in this case",
    ", @xmath40 should be greater than the thermal - equilibration time scales of the bath .    note that for all realistic processes the operator @xmath20 is unitary , i.e. , it satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "however , for the derivation of the results in this article , this requirement appears to be unnecessarily too restrictive ; we only need to assume that @xmath20 is an isometry , i.e. , only @xmath42 is assumed to be satisfied .",
    "therefore , we allow the possibility that the transformation @xmath20 is not surjective .",
    "the generalization of unitary transformations to isometries also serves another purpose .",
    "there are some quantum operations , like landauer erasures , which can only be realized by proper isometries instead of unitaries .",
    "this is quite obvious for landauer erasures since all possible accessible final states do not span the whole of the hilbert space of ab , because any initial pure state of ab is mapped to a final product state where a is in @xmath43 state should send all of these to a state where a is in @xmath19 state . ] .",
    "as @xmath20 is not surjective , it can not possibly be unitary .",
    "such proper isometries can in principle be realized by a hamiltonian evolution , provided that ideal tools like perfectly impenetrable barriers are used for making parts of the hilbert space inaccessible .",
    "it is assumed that the bath is in canonical thermal equilibrium state before the transformation and thus @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the inverse temperature and @xmath46 is the corresponding partition function .",
    "it is appropriate to also assume that the bath is sufficiently small so that @xmath21 is manageable .",
    "we will say that b is a _",
    "system if @xmath46 is finite for all temperatures ( @xmath47 ) . in this case , b has finite thermodynamical properties .",
    "note that a single hydrogen atom or a single free particle placed in an infinite space has an infinite partition function and therefore these are not finite systems by the current definition .",
    "but , if the atom or the particle is placed inside a large but finite box , then they will become finite systems .",
    "note also that any realistic system , which has a finite number of particles constrained inside a finite volume , will be classified as finite by this definition .",
    "infinite systems have individually vanishing level occupation probabilities and consequently the analysis of such systems present some difficulties .",
    "this is the main reason for using finite systems in this article .",
    "let @xmath48 be the equilibrium energy of the bath .",
    "since there is no structural change in the bath , the heat dumped to the bath during the realization is equal to the change in the average energy , @xmath49 , between times @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath12 is the hto of this realization , which is defined as @xmath51       -   e_b \\mathds{1}_a     ~.    \\label{eq : q_definition}\\ ] ] a number of comments have to be made in order to comprehend the real nature of the hto .",
    "first , @xmath12 is a hermitian operator defined on the state space @xmath52 of the device a. its expectation value is evaluated with the initial state , @xmath14 , of the device . in other words , it is an operator that can be used for expressing the energy transferred to b in terms of the state of a. second , only the average of @xmath12 can be given a physical meaning .",
    "it has been shown that no quantum observable can be defined for the work done or the heat transferred during a process that captures the detailed distribution of these quantities@xcite . however ,",
    "if only the average @xmath49 is needed , then eq .  ( [ eq : delta_eb_defined ] ) is the correct definition , which eventually yields the hto @xmath12 . on the other hand , @xmath12 can not be used for computing the higher moments of the energy transferred to b. for example , even though the average energy transferred to b is given by @xmath53 , the quantity @xmath54 or the averages of other nonlinear functions of @xmath12 do not have the anticipated meaning .",
    "averages of such nonlinear functions of energy change of b should be computed separately following the approach in ref .  .",
    "this crucial property of the hto must always be kept in mind .",
    "once the hto is computed , the average total work that needs to be done for carrying out the operation can be obtained as @xmath55 as a result , for investigating the average energies transferred during the realization of the operation @xmath13 , the only nontrivial quantity to be determined is the heat dumped to the bath .",
    "this is the main reason why this article concentrates solely on the hto .",
    "the isometry condition @xmath56 and the fact that the bath is in thermal equilibrium imposes some restrictions on the operator @xmath12 .",
    "the investigation of these restrictions is the primary subject of this article .",
    "the main question that needs to be answered is the following : for any given quantum operation @xmath13 , hermitian operator @xmath12 and temperature value @xmath3 , is it possible to find a bath b ( namely a hamiltonian @xmath32 ) and an isometry @xmath20 such that both eq .",

    "these conditions will enable us to discuss the thermodynamics of quantum information processing ( for given @xmath13 ) without specifying anything about the bath , the bath - device coupling and the specific way the quantum operation is realized .    before embarking on the investigation of this problem",

    "\\(ii ) if @xmath12 is a possible hto for an operation @xmath13 , then for any positive number @xmath60 , the operator @xmath61 is also a possible hto for the same operation . in other words",
    ", it is always possible to dump an additional heat @xmath60 whose amount is independent of the state of the device .    to show this ,",
    "suppose that @xmath20 on bath b is a realization of @xmath13 that yields the hto @xmath12 .",
    "let c be a two - level system with hamiltonian @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the associated pauli spin matrix .",
    "now , take bc as the new bath and apply the isometry @xmath64 to the composite system abc .",

    "this shows that @xmath71 is also a possible hto for the same operation .",
    "\\(iii ) the set of two - tuples @xmath72 formed from quantum operations @xmath13 and allowed htos @xmath12 is a convex set .",
    "in other words , if @xmath73 is a possible hto for the operation @xmath74 for @xmath75 , then for any @xmath76 with @xmath77 , the operator @xmath78 is a possible hto for the operation @xmath79 .    before showing this , first note that realizations for each @xmath74 can be assumed to involve the same bath b. this",
