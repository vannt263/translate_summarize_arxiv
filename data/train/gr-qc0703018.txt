    "when a rapidly rotating gas of bosons is cooled down below the bose - einstein condensation temperature a regular lattice of vortices ( abrikosov lattice ) emerges .",
    "the velocity vector field which initially circulated around the only axis of rotation now rotates locally around every vortex core .",
    "interestingly , in the general relativity theory there also exist both types of rotation .",
    "a homogeneous spacetime with the latter type of rotation was discovered by gdel @xcite long time ago .",
    "chapline and mazur have argued recently @xcite that a bec with an array of vortices and a gdel - type metric will provide a solution of the einstein - gross - pitaevskii system ( in the coarse - grained , @xmath4 limit ) . by gdel - type",
    "we mean homogeneous stationary spacetimes in which matter rotates around every point relative to the `` compass of inertia''@xcite . as in isotropic cosmology , the hypersurfaces `` @xmath5const '' can have either lobachevsky , flat or spherical geometry with the radius of curvature being a parameter .",
    "the angular velocity of rotation provides the second parameter of the gdel - type spacetimes .    in this paper",
    "we set ourselves a modest task of analyzing the dalembert equation in the gdel - type spacetimes with spherical and lobachevsky sections ( in the latter case we confine ourselves to the case of sufficiently rapid rotation ) .",
    "we shall , of course , profit from the work of a number of authors who have , from different angles , attacked this problem before , @xcite .",
    "therefore , our goal here is not to discover , but rather to consolidate , simplify ( and where necessary - to correct ) the work of others in order to lay solid foundations for further progress .",
    "this short paper has one main section ( the second one ) , which is divided into two parts treating the dalembert equation in the lobachevsky and spherical cases separately .",
    "we have also included appendices on the lobachevsky geometry and on the sources of gdel - type spacetimes for quick reference .",
    "in order to find the solutions of the dalembert equation in the spacetimes of gdel type we will make use of the fact , that these spacetimes are stationary , homogeneous and axially symmetric .",
    "thus , we will assume that the solutions , @xmath6 , of the wave equation , @xmath7 , can be separated according to @xmath8 where the function @xmath9 should be periodic in @xmath10 with the period of @xmath11 .",
    "in the following we shall classify the allowed functions , @xmath9 , in the lobachevsky and spherical cases separately .",
    "the original gdel spacetime is a stationary four - dimensional spacetime with the @xmath5const hypersurfaces being just @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lobachevsky space ( or hyperbolic plane , see appendix a ) .",
    "these hypersurfaces are threaded by a constant , homogeneous gravimagnetic field perpendicular to the lobachevsky space ( i.e. along the @xmath1 direction ) .",
    "there family of gdel - type metrics @xcite is parameterized by the `` amount of rotation '' @xmath14 and the magnitude of lobachevsky curvature denoted by @xmath15 ( see appendix b ) : @xmath16 where all the coordinates are dimensionless , and @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 range over the whole @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the usual identification of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the metric is of the form @xmath24 , with the lobachevsky space metric @xmath25 and a constant gravimagnetic ( lense - thirring ) field on this space @xmath26 with the same constant being equal to the contravariant @xmath1 component of the rotation vector of the @xmath27 vector field ( velocity field of the sources ) .",
    "the case @xmath28 corresponds to a static spacetime with lobachevsky spatial sections , while @xmath29 corresponds to the original gdel metric .    in this paper",
    "we deal only with spacetimes of sufficiently rapid rotation @xmath30 ( that is , @xmath31 ) . in order to solve the wave equation in these spacetimes ,",
    "we will make use of the underlying lobachevsky structure .",
    "the dalembert equation for @xmath6 is @xmath32 \\psi_{tt}+\\frac{{{\\alpha}}}{\\cosh^2(x/2)}\\psi_{t{{\\varphi}}}-\\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "-\\frac{1}{\\sinh^2(x)}\\psi_{{{\\varphi}}{{\\varphi}}}-\\psi_{33}-\\psi_{xx}-\\coth(x)\\psi_x=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the following three operators , which are killing vectors of the gdel spacetimes multiplied by @xmath33 , fulfill the same commutation relations as the killing vectors @xmath34 of the lobachevsky plane ( see appendix a ) : @xmath35 while the remaining two killing vectors , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , obviously commute with the above ones .",
    "we notice further , that making use of the separation ansatz ( [ separation ] ) for @xmath6 , we are lead to @xmath38 where here : @xmath39 .",
    "the wave equation therefore reduces remarkably to @xmath40\\psi(x,{{\\varphi}})\\ ] ] because we are interested in the regime @xmath41 , it remains to determine the possible eigenfunctions , @xmath9 , with a _ positive _ eigenvalue of the casimir operator @xmath42 which was defined above .",
    "because of the ansatz , the operator @xmath42 becomes now a second order partial differential operator acting on @xmath9 .    in order to determine the eigenfunctions ,",
    "let us now regard @xmath42 ( and , in fact , the whole set @xmath43 ) as an operator acting in the hilbert space of square - integrable functions of @xmath44 with the scalar product provided by the lobachevsky product , ( [ product ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to recall the classification of the unitary irreducible representations of the reduced lorentz group @xmath45 ( two boosts and one rotation ) and of its corresponding spinor group @xmath46su(1,1 ) of bargmann @xcite . for positive eigenvalues of @xmath42 one",

    "the number @xmath3 is real and positive covers @xmath54 infinitely often .",
    "he restricts himself to single - valued representations of @xmath54 , and as a consequence treats only integer and half - integer @xmath55 s .",
    "we see no reason for such a restriction here , and therefore leave @xmath55 real . ] , while in @xmath47 it is real and negative .",
    "let us determine all these functions explicitly .",
    "for the complex parameter @xmath56 we note that @xmath57 where @xmath58 . we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we may verify , that @xmath62&=&-2j_0,\\\\ c_2&=&j_0(j_0 + 1)-j_-j_+,\\\\ c_2&=&j_0(j_0 - 1)-j_+j_-,\\label{eigenc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are all standard relations in the theory of representations of su(1,1 ) .",
    "for a given @xmath3 the families of simultaneous eigenfunctions of @xmath42 and @xmath50 are constructed upon a reference vectors , denoted here by @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) , annihilated by ( or @xmath65 ) . ]",
    "@xmath53 ( or @xmath65 ) .",
    "this leads to two families , @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "we find immediately @xmath66 where @xmath3 is the eigenvalue of @xmath50 , and @xmath67 the eigenvalue of @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath68 depends , via the last term , on the angle @xmath10 . since it must be periodic in @xmath10 , with identical values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the number @xmath71 must be integer . in the original variables we have @xmath72 further restrictions ,",
    "@xmath73 are obtained from the requirement of square integrability w.r.t .",
    "the product ( [ product ] ) at @xmath74 and at infinity , respectively and @xmath1 the @xmath75 vector becomes time - like for large @xmath76 , allowing for functions growing exponentially with @xmath76 ( omitting the second restriction ) would certainly make no sense . ] .",
    "a connection with the methods of ordinary differential equations is provided by the following consideration : the eigenvalue problem for the casimir operator , @xmath77 with @xmath78 leads , with a separation ansatz @xmath79 , @xmath80 to the equation @xmath81f={{\\lambda}}({{\\lambda}}-1)f,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 .",
    "this is an equation with three regular singular points , at @xmath83 , with the exponents @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "evidently , the function(s ) we have found by algebraic methods , @xmath63 , have the right asymptotics at @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) _ and _ at infinity ( @xmath89 ) to be square integrable at these extremes .",
    "let us now summarize the results .",
    "the solutions are characterized by the momentum in the @xmath1 direction ( @xmath90 ) and by the representation parameters @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "the wave equation has the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 depends only on the parameter @xmath95 of the spacetime , and @xmath96 is an integer .",
    "the above dispersion relation is unusual by the sign in front of @xmath97 .",
    "the solution for @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 but only if @xmath100 , which is possible only if @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , because of ( [ param ] ) , there also exists a gap in frequencies : @xmath102 .",
    "the function @xmath103 is an eigenfunction of @xmath42 to the eigenvalue @xmath104 , and of @xmath50 to the eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "it is square - integrable if @xmath105 and if @xmath106 ( which is an integer ) is non - negative .",
    "consequently , @xmath42 is non - negative and @xmath107 is square - integrable if @xmath108 .",
    "because of that , the frequency @xmath109 is now positive , and the wave equation @xmath110 has solutions @xmath111 only if @xmath112 ( in order to satisfy @xmath113 ) . here ,",
    "again @xmath102 .",
    "the case of spacetimes with spherical @xmath114 hyperplanes ( threaded by a homogeneous gravimagnetic field ) is simpler , and the resulting functions , @xmath9 belong to a known family of functions ( spin `` a '' spherical harmonics ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 has the interpretation of the latitude ) .",
    "the wave equation can be solved similarly , though in this case the dalembert operator is given by @xmath118 \\psi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the casimir operator of a modification of the algebra the so(3 ) of ( symmetry ) generators : @xmath119 and @xmath120 the above operators fulfill the so(3 ) relations : @xmath121=2l_3,\\qquad [ l_\\pm , l_3]=\\mp l_\\pm.\\ ] ] the representation spaces are grouped in sectors , each with a definite value of @xmath122 and @xmath123 $ ] , where @xmath3 is a positive integer or half - integer are allowed , for otherwise one would be lead to standard contradictions ( eg . states of negative norm , after sufficiently many applications of @xmath124 ) . ] .    the lowest states , @xmath125 , which are annihilated by @xmath126 with the eigenvalue @xmath52 of @xmath127 , and the highest states @xmath128 ( annihilated by @xmath124 with the eigenvalue @xmath3 of @xmath127 ) can now be determined .",
    "one finds @xmath129 these function must be periodic in @xmath10 , with identical values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and therefore @xmath130 must also be an integer . now it is easy to see , that either there holds @xmath131 or the function @xmath125 will not be square integrable on the sphere ( in @xmath44 ) because of singularities at @xmath74 or @xmath132 respectively .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath133 there remains a freedom to choose @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "this can be viewed as a condition specifying @xmath98 , so that the structure is the following :    there are infinitely many sectors with integer or half - integer @xmath98 . in each of these sectors",
    "there are eigenspaces of @xmath135 to the eigenvalues @xmath104 with @xmath136 ( with an integer @xmath137 ) .",
    "each of such eigenspaces is spanned by @xmath138 functions generated by a successive application of @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "the eigenspace @xmath139 , @xmath140 consists of two functions first encountered by dirac @xcite in the context of magnetic monopoles , @xmath141 the functions we have found are also known as the monopole harmonics or the spin-@xmath98 spherical harmonics @xcite , so that further properties ( eg . completeness for each @xmath98 ) and identities among these functions are known .",
    "we may now summarize the results taking into account the wave equation .",
    "each solution is characterized by the parameters : frequency ( @xmath109 ) , momentum in the @xmath1 direction ( @xmath90 ) , sector number @xmath98 ( which is an integer or half - integer ) , and the pair @xmath91 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 $ ] . with @xmath144 the frequency",
    "is fixed by the sector number @xmath98 .",
    "such a quantization of frequencies has an alternative , kinematical ( gauge ) derivation pointed out long time ago by mazur @xcite .",
    "the only role of the wave equation is to provide a relation between @xmath145 and @xmath98 : @xmath146 thus , in each sector ( for each energy ) @xmath90 belongs to a discrete bounded set .",
    "starting with the separation ansatz ( [ separation ] ) we have solved the dalembert equation in the spacetimes of gdel type . in the spherical case the functions with the frequency @xmath147 , @xmath148 turned out to coincide with the @xmath149-weighted spherical harmonics . in the lobachevsky case",
    "we have given simple formulas for obtaining all the solutions belonging to the @xmath2 sectors of irreducible unitary representations of the reduced lorentz group .",
    "the wave equation enforced @xmath150 and a gap in frequencies @xmath151 .",
