    "graphene is an astonishing material with a zero energy gap and massless charge carriers .",
    "this allows relativistic physics to be studied in the solid state and leads to many remarkable phenomena @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant to graphene dots is the quantum klein paradox .",
    "this makes all potential barriers perfectly transparent to graphene charge carriers moving in one and two dimensions @xcite so it is impossible to confine graphene carriers in an external potential well .",
    "however it is possible to confine them with a combination of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "essentially , the magnetic field deflects the carriers so that they move in closed orbits and remain localised but this kind of confinement can not be achieved with an arbitrary combination of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the conditions needed have been analysed by giavaras , maksym and roy @xcite who have suggested a device structure that can be used to probe both confined and deconfined states in graphene dots .",
    "the present work is about a simpler structure that can be used to focus on confined states .",
    "conditional confinement is the one of the most important differences between graphene and conventional semiconductors .",
    "it is a direct consquence of the lack of mass .",
    "roughly speaking , confined quantum states occur only when all the corresponding classical orbits are bounded but when massless particles move in a weak magnetic field _ both _ bounded _ and _ unbounded orbits occur at the same energy . raising the magnetic field",
    "removes the unbounded orbits and enables confined states to occur .",
    "details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite for circularly symmetric scalar potentials , @xmath2 and azimuthal vector potentials , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial distance and @xmath5 . in this case",
    "all the states are confined when @xmath6 but when @xmath7 the states are confined only when @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi velocity of the graphene sheet .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath11 are experimentally tunable parameters this allows both confined and deconfined states to be probed in graphene dots and the interesting transition between the two regimes that occurs when @xmath12 could also be probed experimentally .",
    "another important difference between graphene and conventional semiconductors is that graphene is gapless .",
    "dots in conventional semiconductors are engineered so that the dot states are both confined and have energies in the band gap .",
    "thus the dot states are spatially and energetically isolated from the rest of the system .",
    "the dot is an artificial atom and any probe of energy levels in the gap , for example charging experiments , is only sensitive to dot states and does not respond to bulk states .",
    "it is more difficult to achieve this in graphene because there is no natural gap .",
    "one option is to engineer a device structure that puts confined dot states in the gap between bulk landau levels .",
    "however there is a problem .",
    "the potentials in a real graphene dot can not rise indefinitely as a power law and must become flat asymptotically .",
    "so there are bulk landau states outside the dot and it is necessary to ensure that the confined dot states occur in a region of low density of states away from the broadened bulk landau levels .",
    "giavaras , maksym and roy @xcite showed that it is possible to achieve this while allowing the confinement - deconfinement transition to be observed provided that the scalar potential consists of a well which is separated from the asymptotic region by a barrier .",
    "however the barrier is not needed if one only wants to probe confined states .",
    "then one can use a simple potential well as shown in figure [ ebfigure ] .    a well in a uniform",
    ", perpendicular magnetic field clearly satisfies the confinement condition when the field is strong enough .",
    "the reason why it also satisfies the condition for energetic isolation is related to the unusual physics of the zeroth landau level in graphene . in brief",
    ", the zeroth landau level has zero energy and when a potential well of depth @xmath0 is applied to graphene the energy of states formed from the zeroth landau level does not shift by more than about @xmath13 .",
    "so dot states can be isolated energetically by choosing @xmath0 to put them into the middle of the landau gap .",
    "the same result applies to antidot states , which are also confined because of the symmetry of the dirac cone .",
    "so observations of the symmetry between dot and antidot confined states would give a direct experimental confirmation of the influence of the dirac cone on the graphene dot energy spectrum .",
    "this physics is detailed in section [ physicssection ] and numerical studies of the dot energy spectrum and quantum states are reported in section [ numericalsection ] where the properties of the graphene dot are compared with those of a typical electrostatic dot formed from gaas .",
    "the graphene sheet is taken to be in a uniform , perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath14 and the azimuthal component of the magnetic vector potential at position @xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the scalar potential is taken to be @xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 , where the @xmath21 sign corresponds to an antidot , the @xmath22 sign corresponds to a dot and @xmath23 is a size parameter . in terms of these parameters",
    "the depth of the dot and height of the antidot are given by @xmath24 . because the solution to the laplace equation can be written as a fourier series , this simple form is a crude model of the potential in a real dot .",
    "the potentials have circular symmetry so the quantum states are eigenstates of angular momentum , @xmath25 , where the angular momentum quantum number is the integer @xmath26 .",
    "the graphene states are two - component states where each component gives the probability amplitude for an electron being on one of the two sub - lattices of the graphene sheet .",
    "the two - component envelope function is @xmath27 and the radial functions , @xmath28 satisfy @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 mev nm and @xmath31 is the energy .",
    "the fermi velocity is given by @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 these equations give the graphene landau levels of energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the magnetic length , @xmath37 is the landau quantum number and @xmath38 is a radial quantum number .",
    "the zeroth landau level states correspond to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "unlike the situation of a particle with mass , the energy of the zeroth landau level is exactly zero and there is no zero point energy .",
    "in addition @xmath41 vanishes and @xmath42 so that the quantum states are localised on rings whose radius increases like @xmath43 .",
    "now consider what happens to the zeroth landau level states in the presence of a non - zero potential .",
    "in this case @xmath41 no longer vanishes but it can be shown that the zero point energy remains small @xcite . consequently the energy of the states is determined mainly by the local potential . in the case of a dot the lowest energy states are those of smallest spatial extent so if the dot is large enough that the @xmath44 state fits into it , the energy of the lowest state in the dot is no more than @xmath0 below the asymptotic value of the potential .",
    "when @xmath26 increases the states are localised in regions of weaker potential so their energy tends to increase with @xmath26 . in the limit of very large @xmath26",
    ", the states merge into the bulk zeroth landau level which is shifted from zero by the asymptotic value of the potential .",
    "these statements can be proved rigorously but the details are quite complicated @xcite .",
    "this physics is the key to isolating a confined dot state energetically . if @xmath0 is chosen to be about half of the gap between landau level 0 and landau level -1 , that is @xmath45 , the lowest dot state will be in the desired region of very low density of states .    to analyse the case of an antidot consider what happens when @xmath46 is replaced by @xmath47 .",
    "it can be shown by direct substitution into the radial equations that if @xmath27 is an eigenstate of energy @xmath31 corresponding to potential @xmath46 , then @xmath48 is an eigenstate of energy @xmath49 corresponding to potential @xmath47 .",
    "hence the antidot states are confined whenever the dot states are confined and the energy of the _ highest _ antidot state is no more than @xmath0 about the asymptotic value of the antidot potential . the fact that both dots and antidots confine electrons is unique to graphene and is an observable consequence of its dirac cone band structure .",
    "to compute energies and states , the radial equations are made real by putting @xmath50 , @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 are found with the method outlined in ref .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath54 mev , @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 nm . hence @xmath57 mev , about half the landau gap at 5 t and @xmath58 becomes @xmath59 mev outside the dot or antidot .",
    "magnetic field dependent energy spectra are shown in figure [ ebfigure ] .",
    "each spectrum consists of a superposition of energy levels and the @xmath26 range , @xmath60 , is chosen so that all states localised in the dot or antidot are included in the field range between 1 and 5.5 t. for comparison , the dashed lines show the landau levels of an ideal graphene sheet .",
    "these levels are shifted by the asymptotic value of the potential , -10 mev in the case of the dot and + 10 mev in the case of the antidot .",
    "the effect of the external potential is clearly to broaden the landau levels . in the case of the dot",
    ", the zeroth landau level at -10 mev is broadened into a band that occupies the region between -10 and -50 mev and the width of the band is very insensitive to the magnetic field . as expected the width of the band simply reflects the range of potential values : no zeroth landau level state rises in energy above -10 mev and no zeroth landau level state falls in energy below about -50 mev .",
    "in contrast , the upper edge of the broadened @xmath61 landau level falls in energy like @xmath62 and the lower edge of the broadened @xmath63 landau level rises in energy like @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the band of @xmath65 dot states becomes energetically isolated as the field increases . with the present model parameters , the lowest dot state appears about in the middle of the gap when the field is about 5 t. in a real graphene sheet the landau levels",
    "are broadened because of imperfections but the same principle applies and the magnetic field and potential can be chosen so that the lowest dot state lies in a region of extremely low density of states between broadened landau levels .",
    "the right hand side of figure [ ebfigure ] shows the antidot spectrum .",
    "it has the same features as the dot spectrum except that the band of confined antidot states appears in the gap between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 landau levels .",
    "the symmetry between the dot and antidot spectra is clearly visible .",
    "figure [ statefigure ] shows the lowest ( @xmath44 ) state in a dot and demonstrates that it is confined within the dot .    in summary ,",
    "the proposed graphene dot is able to confine electrons in a region that is isolated both spatially and energetically .",
    "the typical spacing between the dot levels at @xmath67 t ranges from @xmath68 mev for @xmath56 nm to @xmath69 mev for @xmath70 nm .",
    "these sizes and level spacings are comparable to those for a gaas electrostatic dot with confinement energy 4 mev in a magnetic field range of 3 - 10 t. the energy levels in the gaas dot can be resolved by charging experiments , for example , so similar experiments on the graphene dot should be feasible .",
