    "solar energetic particles ( sep ) , which are somehow accelerated in association with solar eruptive events , offer hazards for equipment and astronauts on spacecraft and even for passengers and crew members on aircraft in high - latitude flights due to secondary particles .",
    "the highest - energy extremity of sep events sometimes produces in the earth s atmosphere considerable fluxes of secondary neutrons , which are able to cause ground - level enhancements ( gle ) of cosmic ray intensity registered preferentially with high - latitude neutron monitors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest latitude , at which a gle is observed , is determined by the energy of primary particles .",
    "existing methods to diagnose sep productivity of a solar eruption , which just occurred , are not yet perfect .",
    "still larger uncertainties exist in forecasting sep events .",
    "elaboration of existing methods call for better understanding of particle acceleration , when and where it occurs , and in which conditions .",
    "seps mainly consist of protons , alpha particles , and heavier ions .",
    "their energies range from tens to hundreds of mev , and sometimes up to several gev . unlike electrons , which are widely manifest in all layers of the solar atmosphere practically in the whole observable range of electromagnetic emissions , starting from gamma - ray bremsstrahlung continuum and up to metric radio waves , energetic protons on the sun",
    "can only be detected from gamma - ray emissions appearing in their interactions with dense material ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these are discrete gamma - ray lines in a range of 0.510 mev produced by nuclei with energies of a few tens of mev , and a very broad line around 70 mev produced in the decay of neutral pions , which appear in interactions of protons with energies exceeding 300  mev .",
    "the @xmath2-decay emission can only be identified with high - sensitivity gamma - ray spectrometers in big flares , and therefore the number of all events , in which this emission has been detected so far , starting from its first observation reported by @xcite , is as small as one dozen ( see @xcite for the review ; recent case studies , e.g. , by @xcite ) .",
    "imaging in nuclear gamma - ray lines is only possible from data of reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi , @xcite ) and does not exceed the energy of the 2.22 mev line .",
    "one more source of information about accelerated particles on the sun is provided by solar neutrons , which are produced in collisions of high - energy protons , and are sometimes registered with low - latitude neutron monitors on the sunlit side of earth ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as some space - borne detectors .",
    "it is possible to follow propagation in the interplanetary space of energetic electrons from their signatures in decameter to kilometer radio waves . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of observations , which could track heavy energetic particles from the sun to earth , hampers understanding their origin .",
    "there are two different major viewpoints on the origins of seps in the interplanetary space ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one concept relates seps with flare processes within an active region ( e.g. , @xcite ) . according to the different concept",
    ", seps are accelerated to high energies by a bow shock driven by the outer surface of a super - alfvnic cme ( e.g. , @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the seemingly incompatibility of the two concepts is due to the traditional idea that particle acceleration occurs either ( i )  within a closed flaring solar active region or ( ii )  rather far from the sun by a shock wave , whose properties are determined by the cme and not by the flare .",
    "the cme and flare are considered to be independent of each other .    on the other hand , studies of last years , supported by the increasing observational material ,",
    "specify long - standing issues and update corresponding concepts .",
    "the cme acceleration turns out to be closely associated with a flare and occur simultaneously with hxr and microwave bursts ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the helical component of the cme s magnetic flux rope responsible for its acceleration is formed by reconnection , which is also responsible for a flare @xcite .",
    "there is a detailed quantitative correspondence between the reconnected flux and the rate of energy release during a flare ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , parameters of a cme should correlate with parameters of the associated flare , that has been established indeed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , ( ) and @xcite have shown that shock waves , most likely , are excited by erupting flux ropes as impulsive pistons inside developing cmes , and this occurs during hard x - ray and microwave flare bursts ( i.e. , at the rise phase of the soft x - ray emission ) .",
    "then , the shock wave detaches from the piston , and quasi - freely propagates afterwards like a decelerating blast wave .",
    "the transition of the shock wave to the bow - shock regime is expected later , probably , beyond the field of view of lasco / c3 . as the results of @xcite show",
    ", the release of seps near the sun occurs within a few solar radii .",
    "parameters of the shocks at such distances should be mainly determined by their initial sources and therefore related to parameters of the associated flares .",
    "note also that from the preceding paragraph it follows that the early evolution of the cme speed is expected to be roughly proportional to the soft x - ray flux time profile at the rising phase .",
    "that is , if the soft x - ray flux increases gradually , then the development of a shock wave is not expected at small distances from the sun .",
    "cmes should favor escape of flare - accelerated particles trapped in the flux rope ( k .- l .",
    "klein , 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "reconnection of the expanding cme s flux rope with a coronal streamer allows trapped particles to access magnetic fields , which are open into the interplanetary space , and facilitates their escape , thus solving the problem discussed by @xcite .",
    "a possible extremity is presented by jet - like eruptions , when reconnection decomposes the magnetic flux rope ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these considerations show that the traditional contrasting the flare - acceleration and shock - acceleration options is probably exaggerated .",
    "there are convincing arguments in favor of either option . while gamma - rays nearly concurrent with different flare emissions favor flare - acceleration of heavy particles simultaneously with electrons",
    ", there is no reason to object shock - acceleration , if in situ measurements of the sep composition such as the iron charge state , fe / o ratio , and other parameters indicate acceleration of ions at normal coronal temperatures ( see , e.g. , ) . on the other hand , in situ measurements",
    "are limited to moderate energies of ions , while acceleration of heavier particles is more efficient by fermi processes operating in shock - acceleration indeed .",
    "it is possible that the contesting concepts are based on different observations subjected to selection effects .",
    "for all these reasons , it seems to be logical to expect the correspondence between parameters of seps and microwave bursts .",
    "indeed , the correlation between sep events and strong high - frequency radio bursts has been known for many decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite explained this association by the ` big flare syndrome ' , i.e. , a general correspondence between the energy release in an eruptive flare and its various manifestations , whereas the actual sep acceleration was considered by a cme - driven bow shock .",
    "later exaggerations of the shock - acceleration concept have led to underestimation of diagnostic opportunities of microwave bursts .",
    "however , it seems worth to analyze relations between flare microwave bursts and seps irrespective of their origins .",
    "some aspects of the correspondence between parameters of flares , cmes , shock waves , and seps have been really stated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "relations between sep events and microwave bursts at 9 ghz were considered by @xcite .",
    "this frequency can belong to either optically thin or thick branch of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum that complicates the relation .",
    "higher - frequency emissions in the optically thin regime seem to be most sensitive to large numbers of high - energy electrons gyrating in strong magnetic fields , being thus directly related to the rate of energy release in the flare  cme formation process .",
    "the frequency of 35  ghz is the highest one , at which stable long - term observations are available thanks to the operation of the nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp , @xcite ) . in the present study",
    ", we analyze relations between microwave bursts recorded with norp since 1990 , on the one hand , and large high - energy proton enhancements , on the other hand .",
    "systematic lists are available of data on proton events ( e.g. , @xcite ) and especially on gle events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath3 sfu criterion selected sep - productive events , and not only west ones .",
    "we extend our analysis to a larger set of events with @xmath4 sfu occurring during the norp observational daytime . to reveal the events missed by our criterion",
    ", we also consider all near - earth @xmath5 mev proton enhancements exceeding @xmath6 pfu [ 1 pfu = 1 particle/(@xmath7  s@xmath8  ster@xmath8 ) ] , whose solar source events could be observed in nobeyama .",
    "the input data , their processing , and the output parameters are considered in section  [ s - data ] .",
    "section  [ s - results ] analyzes the parameters of near - earth proton enhancements versus parameters of microwave bursts estimated in section  [ s - data ] . besides the proton - rich events associated with intense bursts at 35 ghz ,",
    "seven additional events have been revealed from the lists of sep events by the @xmath6 pfu criterion .",
    "three of these sep enhancements were due to solar backside events , whose microwave emissions were occulted .",
    "the 35  ghz fluxes for four remaining exceptional proton - rich events ranged from 140 to 780 sfu .",
    "section  [ s - discussion ] shows that a proton - productive event can be expected if a related flare occurs in strong magnetic fields , especially in those associated with sunspots ; discusses possible reasons for the exceptional events ; and proposes a tentative relation between the peak flux observed at 35 ghz and an expected importance of a sep event . section  [ s - conclusion ] briefly summarizes the outcome of our analysis .",
    "data on solar microwave bursts recorded with norp are automatically processed by software and posted on the norp web site .",
    "the results are sometimes insufficiently accurate , e.g. , in evaluation of the pre - burst level , and can suffer from various problems .",
    "these circumstances required examination of all records in question and evaluation of parameters in the interactive mode .",
    "norp records at 35 ghz for some events were absent or damaged . in such cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath9 was estimated by means of interpolation from the 17 ghz and 80 ghz data .",
    "the 80 ghz fluxes during 19952005 were corrected with a time - dependent factor of @xmath10^{630}$ ] ( h.  nakajima 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the norp did not operate at both 35 ghz and 80 ghz on 2004 november 10 ; the parameters of this event were roughly estimated from lower - frequency data and correlation plots of the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly we had to deal with the 2002 april 21 event . with the filled squares . ]    the turnover frequency @xmath11 of the microwave spectrum was computed from norp total flux data by using the parabolic fit of the averaged log ",
    "log spectrum near the peak of the burst .",
    "this way was previously used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we used data of lower - frequency polarimeters , which were located before 1994 in toyokawa @xcite .",
    "the time profiles of the bursts at 35 ghz are sometimes complex , contain more than one peak , etc .",
    "they are typically shorter and more impulsive than those at lower microwaves and quite different from soft x - ray ones , whose time profiles are intrinsically gradual .",
    "it is difficult to measure the duration of a burst at 35 ghz , @xmath12 , with a simple formal criterion , e.g. , by referring to 0.5 or to 0.1 & 0.9 levels .",
    "we have not yet found an adequate formal criterion to characterize durations of complex bursts , and therefore estimated @xmath12 manually by marking characteristic durations .",
    "these estimates are rather subjective and need elaboration .",
    "nevertheless , they represent a general tendency correctly .",
    "the tendency remains , if the formal 0.5-level criterion is used , while the durations , @xmath12 , become shorter .      for convenience ,",
    "we categorize the events according to their microwave fluxes , and denote the groups similar to the goes class : mx ( microwave - extreme ) with @xmath3 sfu , ms ( microwave - strong ) with @xmath13 sfu @xmath14 sfu , mm ( microwave - moderate ) with @xmath15 sfu @xmath16 sfu , and mo ( microwave - occulted ) .",
    "the events and evaluated parameters of the bursts at 35 ghz along with data on near - earth protons are presented in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "it lists chronologically the four groups of events in the descending order of their microwave importance , i.e. , mx , ms , mm , and mo .    column 1 of table  [ tab : table1 ] presents the event number in the table in the form no@xmath17 .",
    "the superscript , q , specifies the qualifier of the event defined as follows :    q0  east event , no cme , no type ii burst ;    q2  west event with a cme and a type ii burst ;    q1  for all other events .",
    "the qualifiers are only indicated for the events , which could be observed by soho / lasco , according to the soho lasco cme catalog ( @xcite , http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme_list ) .",
    "columns 2 and 3 indicate the date and time of the flare peak according to goes reports .",
    "columns 4 , 5 , and 6 present the goes and h@xmath18 importance of the flare and its coordinates .",
    "columns 7 , 8 , and 9 present the burst duration , the maximum flux at 35 ghz in thousands of sfu ( 1 sfu = @xmath19 w  m@xmath20  hz@xmath8 ) , and the microwave peak frequency .    columns 10 and 11 list the maximum near - earth total fluxes of protons with @xmath21  mev ( @xmath22 ) and with @xmath23  mev ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "column 12 characterizes the integral proton spectrum with a parameter @xmath25 , which is calculated from the peak fluxes of protons with different energies occurring at different times , thus attempting to take account of their velocity dispersion .",

    "the duration criterion referring to microwave or soft x - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) also considers indirect outer manifestations of solar events .    as shown in section  [ s - introduction ] , the scenario of a solar event offers very different opportunities for the development of a shock wave and escape of protons from an active region . in a typical powerful cme - productive event",

    "the variety of types of flares and eruptions might respond in their sep outcome .",
    "the most apparent , well - known indication of a shock wave , is a type ii burst ( although the absence of a type ii emission does not guarantee the absence of a shock ) , and an indication of opening magnetic configuration is a cme .",

    "most remaining events ( 17 q1 events ) did not produce near - earth protons with energies @xmath82  mev .",

    "a simple criterion follows from this distribution : if an event has a west location and produces both cme and type ii burst , then the near - earth flux of @xmath41  mev protons expected from this event should be most likely between @xmath46 and @xmath47  pfu .",
    "this criterion can be possibly used as a tentative basis for a future prompt diagnostics of proton events .",
    "recent observations and their studies have revealed still closer relations between solar eruptions , flares , shock waves , and cmes , than previously assumed . this circumstance provides a basis to expect a closer correspondence between parameters of near - earth proton enhancements and microwave bursts than the ` big flare syndrome ' can predict .",
    "this expectation has been mainly confirmed in the present brief analysis of relations between about one hundred of strong microwave bursts recorded in 19902012 with norp at 35  ghz and near - earth proton fluxes .",

    "have a reduced proton outcome up to zero .",
    "on the other hand , most west events associated with intense 35  ghz bursts , cmes , and type ii bursts produce the near - earth fluxes of @xmath41  mev protons between @xmath46 and @xmath47  pfu .",
    "overall , extreme long - duration bursts at 35 ghz ( @xmath3  sfu ) indicate large proton enhancements with predominantly hard energy spectra , including gles .",
    "large sep events are possible even with an eastern location of a solar source region , if the 35 ghz burst is especially intense .",
    "a morphological manifestation of a high - intensity burst at 35 ghz is a flare occurring above the sunspot umbra .",
    "this is a different indication of a possible sep event .",
    "thus , strong high - frequency bursts or / and flare ribbons crossing the sunspot umbrae can be employed to promptest alert of sep events . however , in the case of a backside flare , its microwave emission is occulted for radiometers at earth , while energetic particles propagating along the parker spiral can reach earth .",
