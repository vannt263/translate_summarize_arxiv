    "pu vul was independently discovered by y. kuwano @xcite and m. honda @xcite as a nova - like object .",
    "subsequent observations revealed that pu vul did not behave like a classical nova in its photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "after the rise to the optical maximum , pu vul maintained an almost stable maximum of @xmath3 from 1979 to 1987 except for a deep minimum in 1980 .",
    "it started to fade in 1988 very slowly toward the prediscovery magnitude of @xmath4 @xcite and the photographic magnitude @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such a long - lasted flat peak and a very slow evolution of the light curve made this object quite different from ordinary novae .",
    "pu vul was recognized to be a binary system consisting of an m giant and an outbursting component @xcite and also that the outburst is a thermonuclear runaway event on a white dwarf ( wd ) in a symbiotic binary @xcite .",
    "there were debates on the origin of the deep minimum occurred in 1980 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "after the second eclipse in 1994 , it has been clear that pu vul is an eclipsing binary with the orbital period of 13.4 yr . the observational properties are summarized in table [ table_observation ] , that shows the discovery date , nova speed class , remarkable property of the light curve , indication of dust formation , observational evidence of eclipse , orbital period , peak magnitudes of @xmath6 , information of uv 1455    continuum - band light - curve obtained from fitting of model 1 ( section [ sec_uvlightcurve ] ) , i.e. , peak value and full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) , extinction in literature and our estimates , distance to pu vul in literature and our estimates .",

    "the spectra mimicked those of an f supergiant @xcite in the early phase and changed to a0 @xcite from 1983 to 1986 as the excitation temperature gradually increased @xcite .",
    "@xcite commented that the eruption must have been quite soft because no evidence of shell ejection , both in emission lines and shell absorption lines , was detected .",
    "the optical spectrum was strongly absorption - dominated until 1985 but changed to a distinct nebular spectrum in the second half of 1987 @xcite . in 1990 the star had shown rich emission lines in the optical and uv spectrum , which are typical in the nebular phase and associated with an extended atmosphere of a wd @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting that there is no indication of strong winds in pu vul in contrast to many other classical novae . instead , optically thin mass - ejection from wd photosphere",
    "was suggested from p cygni line - profiles @xcite or triple structure of ir emission lines @xcite .",
    "the line width corresponds to 11001200 km  s@xmath10 in average full widths at zero intensity @xcite , @xmath14 km  s@xmath10 in balmer emission wings @xcite , and 550600 km  s@xmath10 in uv spectra @xcite .",
    "mass ejection was also suggested from x - ray emission detected with rosat on 1012 november 1992 ut and interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature of 0.22 kev ( @xmath15 k ) @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested a collisional origin of the x - ray between a high - density , low - velocity cool wind from the m giant and a low - density , high - velocity hot wind from the wd in the context of common properties of symbiotic novae .",
    "to summarize , the outburst of pu vul was very quiet in the first ten years , and optically thin mass - ejection arises from 19881990 as the nova entered a coronal phase .",
    "these spectral features as well as the long - lasted flat peak make pu vul quite different from many other classical novae in which optical magnitude decays quickly from its peak and spectrum indicates strong optically thick winds .",
    "this paper aims to model such a quite different evolution of pu vul and to understand the cause of such properties .",
    "@xcite reexamined the conditions of occurrence of optically thick winds and found that optically thick winds occur in a limited range of the envelope ( ignition ) mass . for a relatively large envelope mass ,",
    "optically thick winds are suppressed in a way that a large density - inversion layer appears and the gas - pressure gradient balances with the radiation - pressure gradient , the driving force of the winds . in massive wds ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "optically thick winds always occur , because the ignition mass of the wind - suppressed solutions are too massive to be realized in the actual novae . in less massive wds ( @xmath17 ) , on the other hand , no winds are accelerated because the radiation - pressure gradient is too weak to drive the winds . in between them ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath18 , both types of solutions ( wind and wind - suppressed ) can be realized depending on the initial envelope mass . for a less massive envelope ,",
    "optically thick winds are accelerated and a shell flash develops as a normal nova with strong winds . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial envelope mass is relatively large , optically thick winds are suppressed and a nova evolves without winds .",
    "@xcite also presented an idea that such wind - suppressed ( no optically thick wind ) evolution will be realized in a very slow nova that shows a long - lasted flat optical peak .",
    "if the optically thick wind occurs , as in many classical novae , the strong winds carry out most of the envelope matter in a short timescale , and the optical brightness quickly decays .",
    "thus , the light curve has a sharp optical peak . on the other hand , in the wind - suppressed evolutions",
    ", the brightness decays very slowly , because the evolution timescale is determined only by hydrogen nuclear burning .",
    "therefore , the nova stays at a low surface temperature for a long time , which makes a long - lasted flat optical peak .",
    "pu vul is the first example of this new type of evolution .    in section [ sec_uv ]",
    "we review observational results based on the _ iue _ spectra . in section [ sec_model ]",
    "we briefly introduce our method and assumptions of the theoretical model .",
    "section [ sec_lightcurvefitting ] shows how to estimate the wd mass from light curve fittings .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in sections [ sec_discussion ] and [ sec_conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "pu vul had been monitored by _ iue _ from february 1979 to september 1983 and from october 1987 to september 1996 at both low and high resolutions .",
    "a gallery of uv swp spectra from 1992 to 1995 can be found in @xcite .    in the following we revisit the problem of the color excess @xmath11 of pu vul , and describe the long term evolution of the emission lines .",
    "the evolution of the uv continuum will be described in section [ sec_uvlightcurve ] .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra were retrieved from the _ iue _ archive through the ines ( _ iue _ newly extracted spectra ) system , which also provides full details of the observations .",
    "the use of _ iue _ ines data is particularly important for the determination of reddening correction because of the implementation of upgraded spectral extraction and flux calibration procedures compared to previously published uv spectra .",
    "table [ table_observation ] shows that the color excess @xmath11 toward pu vul in the literature lies in the range from 0.3 to 0.5 .",
    "given the large spread of these determinations , we have directly determined @xmath11 from the strength of the 2200    feature seen in the uv spectra of pu vul .",
    "the galactic extinction curve @xcite shows a pronounced broad maximum around 2175    due to dust absorption . since it takes the same value @xmath19 at @xmath20 , 1878 , and 2386  , the slope of the straight line passing through the continuum points at these wavelengths is insensitive to @xmath11 in a @xmath21 plot .",
    "this circumstance can be used to get a reliable estimate of @xmath11 as that in which the stellar continuum becomes closely linear in the 15122386    region , and passes through the continuum points at the above wavelengths . from 9 pairs of short and long wavelength _ iue _ spectra taken from jd 2,448,217 to jd 2,450,342 ,",
    "i.e. during the nebular phase , we have in this way found @xmath1 .",

    "we have measured the mean flux in two narrow bands 20   wide centered at 1455   and 2855  , selected to provide a fairly good representation of the uv continuum because little affected by emission lines @xcite .",

    "note the pronounced uv maximum around jd 2,447,400 followed by a progressive decay at the same time as the uv spectrum becomes harder , as indicated by the decrease of the uv color index .",
    "the delay of the uv maximum with respect to the visual maximum is common both to novae and symbiotic stars @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : lines_puvul ] reports , as a function of time , the observed fluxes in the emission lines of c iii ] 1909  , c iv 1550  , n iv ] 1487  , he ii 1640  , and n v 1240  , which cover a wide range of ionization conditions ( the corresponding ionization energies @xmath28 are 24.4 , 47.9 , 47.4 , 54.4 and 77.5 ev , respectively ) .",
    "the flux measurements were obtained from well exposed _ iue",
    "_ low resolution spectra .",
    "the figure shows clearly that the eclipse around jd 2,449,550 endures longer for high than for low ionization lines .",
    "this suggests that the high ionization lines are formed in the unseen side of the cool giant s wind , so confirming the results by @xcite ( see their figure 5 ) , who found that the uv highest excitation lines of he ii @xmath29 ,",
    "n v @xmath30 , and n iv @xmath31 disappeared during the second eclipse .",
    "nova is a thermonuclear runaway event on a wd @xcite . after unstable",
    "hydrogen nuclear burning triggers a nova outburst , the envelope on the wd greatly expands to a giant size .",
    "after it reaches the optical peak , the envelope expansion settles down into a steady - state .",
    "the optical magnitude decreases as the envelope mass decreases and the photospheric temperature rises with time . in less massive",
    "wds the optically thick wind does not occur as described in section [ sec_introduction ] and , therefore , the decay phase of novae can be followed by a quasi - hydrostatic sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we solved the equations of hydrostatic balance , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere .",
    "the bottom radius is assumed to be the chandrasekhar radius .",
    "the evolution of novae is followed by connecting these solutions along the envelope mass - decreasing sequence .",
    "the time evolution is calculated from the mass decreasing rate which is the summation of the two rates , hydrogen nuclear burning and optically - thin wind mass - loss .",
    "we used opal opacities @xcite .",
    "the method and numerical techniques are essentially the same as those in @xcite . convective energy transport is calculated using the mixing length theory with the mixing - length parameter @xmath32 ( see figure 11 in * ? ? ? * for the dependence of model light curve on the mixing length parameter @xmath33 ) .    in the rising phase",
    ", the envelope does not yet settle down to a thermal equilibrium , i.e. , the nuclear energy generation is larger than the radiative loss .",
    "we have approximated such a stage by a sequence of static solutions of constant mass without thermal equilibrium .",
    "these solutions may not approximate well the rising phase , but are enough to our purpose , because the rising phase plays no important role in the determination of physical values such as the wd mass and distance .      in the later phase of the outburst ( after 1986 ) ,",
    "optically - thin wind may arise because many emission lines had appeared in spectra .",
    "we can not calculate such wind mass - loss , however , because radiative transfer in the optically - thin region is not included in our model calculation .",
    "therefore , we take the wind mass - loss rate as a model parameter",
    ". this optically - thin wind does not affect the envelope structure below the photosphere , but speeds up the nova evolution because mass decreasing rate of the envelope is accelerated by this wind mass - loss .    in line driven winds ,",
    "the mass - loss rate @xmath34 is limited by photon momentum ; the wind can not get momentum much exceeding the momentum of photon flux .",
    "this is in contrast to optically thick winds in which the mass - loss rate could be much larger than the momentum of photon flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume a condition , that the momentum of wind is smaller than that of photon flux , of    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the speed of light .",
    "we get an upper limit of the wind mass - loss rate as    @xmath37    here we take @xmath38 erg  s@xmath10 from a bolometric luminosity of a 0.6 @xmath39 wd ( which will be shown later as model 2 in table [ table_model ] ) , and assume a relatively small value of @xmath40 km  s@xmath10 for a safe upper limit .",
    "@xcite estimated the mass - loss rate of pu vul to be about @xmath41  yr@xmath10 from emission measure on 30 april and 1 may 1988 with a wind velocity of 70 km  s@xmath10 and a hot star radius of @xmath42 cm ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xcite set an upper limit of the mass - loss rate , @xmath44  yr@xmath10 . @xcite estimated the mass - loss rate from @xmath45 line luminosity of 144 @xmath46 on 28 september 1988 , assuming optically - thin fully - ionized winds . with a terminal velocity 2,100 km  s@xmath10 of a given velocity profile , skopal obtained the mass - loss rate to be @xmath47yr@xmath10 .",
    "these values , however , may be a little bit larger than our momentum condition ( [ equation_masslossc ] ) .    in our model , we assume no wind mass - loss during the optical flat peak because no emission lines are observed or they are very weak .",
    "we assume that optically thin - wind begins when the photospheric temperature rises to @xmath48 ( k ) @xmath49 .",
    "this wind seems to have much weakened sometime around 1999 - 2001 , because , after that , the optical light curve changed its shape and seems to decay as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the time after the decay started . in classical novae , the @xmath50 decay is often observed in the later phase of the outburst , and is interpreted as emission from homologously expanding optically thin plasma with a constant mass , which indicates that the mass supply had stopped @xcite . in the case of pu vul , the wind had not stopped entirely since p cyg profiles are still observed in 2004 @xcite . therefore , we assume that the optically - thin wind begins at @xmath48 ( k ) @xmath52 and continues until @xmath48 ( k ) @xmath53 at a rate shown later , and after that the wind mass - loss rate dropped to @xmath54 yr@xmath10 .",
    "after the maximum expansion of the photosphere , the photospheric radius ( @xmath55 ) gradually decreases keeping the total luminosity ( @xmath56 ) almost constant .",
    "the photospheric temperature ( @xmath57 ) increases with time because of @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum emission shifts from optical to supersoft x - ray through ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "this causes the luminosity decrease in optical and increase in uv and finally increase of supersoft x - ray .",
    "we assume that photons are emitted at the photosphere as a blackbody with a photospheric temperature @xmath57 .",
    "the light curve of optical ( @xmath59 ) and uv 1455   fluxes are estimated from the blackbody emission .",
    "@xcite obtained chemical composition of the atmosphere of the hot component of pu vul , in which iron is depleted by a factor of 0.30.5 against the sun .",
    "the number ratio of he / h is estimated to be 0.31 @xcite and 0.146 @xcite from emission line ratios , which shows helium overabundance than the solar value ( he / h @xmath60 ) .",
    "another suggestion comes from the location in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggested that pu vul does not belong to the planar component of the galaxy because the star is off the galactic plane by 0.71.0 kpc , based on their derived distance of 57 kpc .",
    "this value , however , reduced to 0.5 kpc if we adopt the distance of @xmath61 kpc as we will obtain later .    with the information above we assume the mass fraction of hydrogen , helium and heavy elements of the envelope to be ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64)=(0.5 , 0.494 , 0.006 ) .",
    "for comparison , we further assume additional sets of composition i.e. , ( 0.5 , 0.49 , 0.01 ) , ( 0.7 , 0.28 , 0.02 ) and ( 0.7 , 0.29 , 0.01 ) .",
    "we simply assumed that the chemical composition of the envelope is uniform and constant with time .",
    "the uv 1455    flux provides a good representation of the continuum level in novae , because it coincides with a local minimum of line opacity @xcite . in previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that the uv 1455    continuum light curve is very sensitive to model parameters , especially the wd mass .",

    "we see that the uv peak is narrower in more massive wds , because nova evolves faster owing to a less massive envelope and a high nuclear burning rate .",

    "if we adopt a different set of chemical composition , the resultant distance is also changed . for the @xmath116 wd we obtain 3.8 kpc for ( @xmath117 ( 0.5 , 0.01 ) , 3.3 kpc for ( 0.7 , 0.02 ) and 3.5 kpc for ( 0.7 , 0.01 ) .",
    "taking into account that @xmath118 is a bit larger than the recent estimate of solar value ( @xmath119 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 3.3 kpc may be a smaller limit .",
    "thus , we may summarize our distance estimates as @xmath2 kpc .",
    "the error includes ambiguity of the @xmath11 , wd mass , and chemical composition .",
    "as described in section [ sec_model ] , a nova becomes a supersoft x - ray source in the later phase of the outburst . in pu vul , however , the maximum temperature is not high enough compared with a typical classical nova because of the less massive wd ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "our theoretical model predicts that the outburst of pu vul is still ongoing and the temperature is continuously rising . the temperature will finally reach the maximum temperature of @xmath120 k just before hydrogen burning stops ( x - ray turnoff ) , while the flux is almost constant at @xmath121 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we may expect supersoft x - ray from pu vul in future , but it is very difficult to predict this epoch , because it strongly depends on the model parameters , such as the optically - thin wind mass - loss rate , and the chemical composition of the envelope .",
    "no x - ray observations of pu vul have been made since november 1992 .",
    "the detected x - ray flux was attributed to a shock origin of colliding winds @xcite .",
    "pu vul is a symbiotic nova in which the m - giant companion blows a massive cool wind that may preferentially distribute in the orbital plane .",
    "this cool wind may prevent a clear detection of supersoft x - rays from the hot wd .",
    "therefore , the probability of detecting supersoft x - rays would be higher when the wd is in front of the cool wind of the giant ( around 2014 ) and would be very low near the eclipse ( 2020 - 2021 ) .",
    "we have performed simulations for detectability of supersoft x - ray with the assumed values of @xmath111 and @xmath122 kpc .",
    "it will be possible to detect pu vul at 0.007 cts  s@xmath10 with the epic - pn camera onboard _ xmm - newton _ when the temperature is @xmath123 ( k)@xmath124 and the luminosity is @xmath125 erg  s@xmath10 ( probably in 20102020 ) and at about 1 cts  s@xmath10 near the x - ray turnoff time , i.e. , @xmath123 ( k)@xmath126 and @xmath127 erg  s@xmath10 ( probably in 20602090 ) .",
    "however , these estimates are based on our model 1 and model 2 only , and there is a large ambiguity due to uncertainty of the model parameters and assumptions .",
    "especially the above expecting year depends strongly on the assumed wind - mass - loss rate after the photospheric temperature of the wd envelope rises to @xmath123 ( k)@xmath53 .",
    "if the wind - mass - loss will much weaken , the x - ray turnoff time is much later than the above estimates .",
    "we expect that a large part of the envelope will remain on the wd after the outburst of pu vul , because no optically thick wind occurs . from the initial envelope mass and the matter lost by the optically - thin wind as in table [ table_model ]",
    ", we estimate the envelope mass that will remain after the outburst . highly depending on the assumed mass - loss rate as well as the other parameters , it is estimated to be about 7090 % of the initial envelope mass for reliable model parameters .",
    "mass - accreting wds are , in general , potential candidates of progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "however , low mass wds ( @xmath128 ) such as in pu vul have not been considered as a candidate of sne ia , because it is hard to grow to chandrasekhar mass limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    \\1 . based on the idea of @xcite that a long - lasted flat peak of optical light curves can be reproduced by a sequence of wind - suppressed static - solutions , we have succeeded in reproducing the long - lasted optical flat peak of pu vul as well as the uv 1455    continuum light curve .",
    "our model is consistent with spectral features with no indication of strong winds in the flat peak of pu vul .",
    "we may conclude that the outburst of pu vul is still on - going , and has already entered the supersoft x - ray phase .",
    "we encourage x - ray observations in @xmath131 , when the wd is in front of the red giant , that will provide important information on this symbiotic nova .",
    "we would like to thank joanna mikoajewska for valuable discussion on observational features of pu vul .",
    "we are also grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments that helped to improve the manuscript .",
    "we also thank the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for the visual data of pu vul .",
