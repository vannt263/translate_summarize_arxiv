    "phase transitions occur in many different physical systems . in this paper",
    "we shall address a fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition or the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite in the system with @xmath0 symmetry , as well as a second - order one in the system with @xmath3 symmetry @xcite as a particular limit of the @xmath0 theory .",
    "this particular choice of the global symmetries is motivated by those relevant for phase transitions in the strong interactions .",
    "the fundamental theory of the strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "it is known that at a temperature @xmath5 of the same order as the typical qcd scale , @xmath6 , qcd undergoes two types of phase transitions  the chiral phase transition and the quark deconfinement transition @xcite . in particular at the chiral phase transition",
    "the behavior of the system should be characterized by global chiral symmetry @xcite .    for @xmath7 flavors of massless",
    "quarks the qcd lagrangian is invariant under a flavor rotation of the @xmath8 symmetry for left- and right - handed quarks . because of the axial anomaly , the subgroup @xmath9 is explicitly broken ( down to @xmath10 ) on the quantum level , so that in this case the ( continuous ) symmetry is reduced to @xmath11 . here",
    ", the vector symmetry @xmath12 corresponds to the conserved baryon charge and is not broken in the normal phase .    in the qcd vacuum chiral symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken by a nonzero chiral condensate @xcite according to @xmath13 .",
    "in the two - flavor case the symmetry breaking pattern , @xmath14 , is equivalent to @xmath15 , and hence can be mapped onto a ( scalar ) meson model with @xmath16 symmetry @xcite .",
    "this provides a motivation to investigate phase transitions of the @xmath17 scalar theory in the finite-@xmath5 formalism in @xmath18 dimensions , or in the zero-@xmath5 formalism in @xmath19 dimensions , if we assume that the critical behavior is described with a dimensionally reduced theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the theory in the dimensionally reduced description only .",
    "this can be justified as follows : at finite temperature , the euclidean time direction in a @xmath20-dimensional path - integral description becomes compactified . because of this finite extent in the euclidean time direction , in a region close enough to a critical point , the dominant long - range fluctuations will be unable to propagate in the time direction and the system will in effect become @xmath21 dimensional . for a finite-@xmath5 theory in @xmath18 space - time it is therefore expected that the critical behavior can be described in terms of an effective @xmath19 dimensional theory at @xmath22 with its couplings ( which are @xmath5-dependent ) set close to their critical values .",
    "in contrast to the situation described above , if the axial symmetry is _ effectively _ restored close to the transition temperature ( e.g.  because of the instanton suppression at high @xmath5 @xcite ) , the relevant symmetry for the @xmath23 transition is then @xmath24 , which leads us to the analysis on the @xmath0 scalar theory .",
    "assuming that a particular phase transition is of second order and displays critical behavior , one can rely on universality arguments to describe the system in terms of an effective landau - ginzburg - wilson functional which is determined solely from the symmetries and the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the description in terms of such an effective theory is often much simpler than the original microscopic theories , but still captures the long - range phenomena at the critical point .    in the investigation of critical phenomena ,",
    "the correct treatment of low - momentum modes is of paramount importance .",
    "close to a critical point , physical properties of a system are dominated by these low - lying soft modes . since the system has no intrinsic length scale at the critical point , phenomena on all length scales contribute and non - trivial anomalous dimensions can appear . in the case of scalar theories ,",
    "the anomalous dimension at the critical point is generally small , which can justify a simplified treatment .",
    "renormalization group methods have been used to deal with the infrared ( ir ) divergences which appear in the vicinity of critical points @xcite . historically speaking ,",
    "the @xmath4-expansion around @xmath18 dimensions for theories with upper critical dimension @xmath18 has been of great importance @xcite .",
    "while the rg methods are able to deal with ir divergences , calculations of this type are still perturbative and rely on an additional expansion in terms of small coupling constants , which can be justified by the fact that the coupling constants are of order of @xmath4 in the vicinity of the fixed points .",
    "there is a countless number of works on the application of rg methods to the second - order phase transition in the @xmath17 theory @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the theory with @xmath0-symmetry requires more investigation . in the context of the chiral phase transition in qcd ,",
    "such an effective theory has been extensively discussed by pisarski and wilczek @xcite . in their results",
    "the @xmath4-expansion analysis does not find an ir stable fixed point which could control a continuous transition .",
    "this indicates that the transition is presumably driven by fluctuations to be of first order .",
    "[ see also @xcite ] .",
    "this question of the order of the chiral phase transition including the possibility of the effective @xmath9 symmetry restoration has been further analyzed in and beyond the @xmath4-expansion in e.g.@xcite using field - theoretical methods and in @xcite using functional rg methods @xcite as well as the finite-@xmath5 lattice - qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "closely related first - order phase - transitions have been investigated in @xcite with the functional rg .  in a gauge theory",
    "setting , the functional rg has been used to estimate effects of the anomaly on chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and on the phase transition line @xcite in qcd .",
    "also , anomaly effects on the mass spectrum have been described in @xcite by means of non - perturbative dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "the functional rg approach does not rely on an expansion in terms of a small coupling and is capable of describing the full effective potential .",
    "this enables us to directly analyze the critical behavior associated with not only the second - order but also first - order phase transitions . for reviews of the method",
    "see e.g.@xcite .",
    "we use a functional rg equation to describe the behavior of the @xmath0 matrix model at the fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition in the same way as done by berges and wetterich @xcite .",
    "we establish the connection between the functional rg flow equations in the formulation according to @xcite ( i.e. the wetterich equation ) and the @xmath4-expansion .",
    "while there is some literature on the connection between the functional rg and perturbative calculations @xcite , this connection we address is a useful starting point to explore the general rg flow diagram .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , nobody has explicitly retrieved the @xmath4-expansion results from the wetterich equation for the @xmath0 system .",
    "[ see also @xcite .",
    "the connection of the @xmath4-expansion to functional rg equations in a related formalism and the emergence of the wilson - fisher fixed - point in this approach have been pointed out in @xcite . ]    since we are motivated by an interest in the qcd phase transition at finite temperature , we will adhere to the qcd terminology throughout this paper .",
    "that is , we will refer to the @xmath25-component fields in the @xmath3 and @xmath0 theory as the @xmath26-field for the condensing mode which acquires a non - zero expectation value and as the @xmath27-fields for the @xmath28 pseudo - scalar components that are nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "these @xmath29 mesons have parity partners , namely , @xmath30-field and @xmath31-fields .",
    "apart from this , nevertheless , our treatment is generic and is completely parallel to the earlier works by berges and wetterich  @xcite and by berges , tetradis , and wetterich  @xcite . in the next section , as a convenience to readers",
    ", we will briefly summarize our aims in this paper and discuss where they advance beyond those earlier works .",
    "we intend the current calculation as a starting point for further investigations of the transition in the framework of more realistic phenomenological models for qcd thermodynamics @xcite . in such models",
    "gauge degrees of freedom can also be taken into account , but the possibility of a fluctuation - induced change of the order of the transition has not yet been fully investigated due to technical complexity . the inclusion of such effects beyond the mean - field level in these models would be a very interesting problem in the future .    we will organize this paper as follows : we first present a summary of our central results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "then we make a quick review over the functional rg formalism in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we discuss the analytical and numerical calculations in great details in sec .  [",
    "sec : u2u2 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our concluding remarks .",
    "the phase transitions of the @xmath0 scalar theory have been extensively studied in earlier works in the functional rg formalism @xcite .",
    "although there are minor differences in the technical setup , we have performed numerical calculations at the same level of approximation and truncation as used by berges , tetradis , and wetterich in @xcite . before we discuss the details of the calculation , we therefore wish to point out the qualitatively new aspects of this work .",
    "first of all , we would like to emphasize that we use a very simple form of the flow equations ( given by eqs .   and below ) in the local potential approximation which does no longer involve momentum integrations .",
    "this difference from the equations in @xcite arises from a different choice of the ir regulator function .",
    "apart from the wave - function renormalization , which we neglect , the information contained in the rg flow equation is equivalent .",
    "since the content is equivalent , the simpler expressions are advantageous , both for an analysis of the structure of the rg flow and for numerical calculations .",
    "in fact , as we will demonstrate explicitly later in the discussion , we can reproduce the result from the @xmath4-expansion in a short calculation of only a few lines and make the connection between the functional rg equation and the perturbative method very transparent .",
    "this is certainly not a qualitative breakthrough , but such a technical improvement provides useful progress for practical calculations .",
    "second , in this work we propose a new point of view for understanding the fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition .",
    "if the phase transition is of second order , the flow diagram and the fixed - point structure can be studied very well in the space of the coupling parameters .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath17 scalar theory in three dimensions with a field @xmath32 , the relevant operators in terms of the squared field @xmath33 are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the ( ir - scale dependent ) effective potential can thus be written as @xmath36 the relevant coupling parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , run as the ir scale @xmath39 becomes smaller and fluctuations are integrated out . using dimensionless variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we obtain fig .  [",
    "fig : o8 ] . starting from a set of differential flow equations to be derived later , the figure shows how these dimensionless couplings change under a change of the scale @xmath39 .    -@xmath42 plane for the @xmath19 @xmath3 scalar theory that is realized from the @xmath0 theory with @xmath43 chosen initially .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction from larger to smaller @xmath39 and the dots represents the fixed points . ]",
    "the interpretation of such a rg - flow diagram is merely textbook knowledge .",
    "we sketch an illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] to extract the essential features from fig .",
    "[ fig : o8 ] .",
    "if the flow goes toward the left side to smaller values of @xmath44 , the symmetric state at @xmath45 becomes more and more unstable and the system falls into the symmetry - broken phase with @xmath46 .",
    "if the flow goes in the opposite direction toward the right to larger values of @xmath44 , on the other hand , the symmetric phase is a stable ground state .",
    "therefore there is a critical line separating these two regimes .",
    "if the flow starts on the critical line , the system approaches the ir fixed - point which is the critical point characterizing the phase transition .",
    "@xmath17 scalar theory . in the shaded region",
    "the flow goes to @xmath47 and @xmath48 that is the `` necessary condition '' for a double - well shape in the effective potential  . ]    in the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] the flow goes deeper into the region with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "usually such flow patterns are physically meaningless in the analysis of the @xmath17 theory because negative @xmath49 makes the potential   unbounded and the theory is not well defined there .",
    "nevertheless , from the interest in the first - order transition , this shaded region is interesting .",
    "this is because , in view of the potential form  , the destination of the flow , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , is just the `` necessary condition '' to realize a double - well shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) . of course",
    "this is not a `` sufficient condition '' and the existence of the double - well shape depends on how large the sixth - order coupling constant @xmath50 associated with @xmath51 is ( see eq .  ) . if @xmath50 is too small , the potential is not stabilized until very large values of @xmath34 have been reached , for which an expansion like eq .",
    "is unsuitable .",
    "if @xmath50 is too large , the second minimum at @xmath46 simply vanishes and the symmetric phase is always the most stable .",
    "nevertheless , we can say that , if there is a region where the first - order phase transition exists , the flow must satisfy the necessary condition , meaning that the flow must be headed for the region with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .     and @xmath52 .",
    "depending on the sixth - order coefficient the potential may take a double - well form . ]",
    "the @xmath0 theory has at least one more coupling constant @xmath1 in addition to @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( and @xmath50 ) as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : u2u2 ] .",
    "for @xmath55 the theory is reduced into the @xmath3 scalar theory .",
    "then , recalling the discussions in the previous paragraph , we can formulate our expectations about the evolution of the phase diagram .",
    "an interesting question is the following : how does the rg - flow diagram or more specifically the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] change in the @xmath0 model as the additional coupling @xmath1 increases from zero ?",
    "this question does not seem to have been answered explicitly in the earlier works by berges , tetradis , and wetterich  @xcite nor by alford and march - russell  @xcite , though those works contain extensive and detailed discussions .",
    "answering this question is quite intriguing because , as we have explained above , the shaded region has a direct connection to the emergence of the double - well shape in the effective potential .",
    "we can understand the results in a way parallel to the @xmath3 case , using the phase diagram in space spanned by @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "primarily this is just a replacement of the variables used to draw the phase diagram , but it also provides a useful interpretation in terms of the shape of the potential and we believe that it is worth taking a closer look at this interpretation in the following .    before we discuss the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : region04 - 4 ] , [ fig : region04 - 6 ] , and [ fig : region07 - 6 ] , we remark that the horizontal and vertical axes are not , strictly speaking , identical to those in the previous fig .  [",
    "fig : o8 ] . in the diagram we use @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are the coupling parameters at the uv scale @xmath58 , to show the shaded regions .",
    "if the flow starts with initial @xmath56 and @xmath57 inside the shaded region and the specified @xmath59 for each figure , it goes toward @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the ir scale @xmath60 . in the numerical calculation",
    ", we do not actually take the limit of @xmath61 but stop the flow at @xmath62 .",
    "this is a prescription for the numerical calculation ( i.e.  the choice of @xmath63 is just arbitrary ) . as discussed in @xcite , in the context of a first - order transition with bubble formation",
    ", it would make physical sense to stop the flow at some point whose scale should be related to the bubble thickness .",
    "the rg - flow diagram for the @xmath0 model similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : o8 ] is available from the solution of the rg equations for the coupling parameters , that is , the taylor expansion coefficients . in the same way as for the @xmath17 model",
    "we have performed the taylor expansion for the @xmath0 system to derive a set of partial differential equations for @xmath44 , @xmath42 , and @xmath64 .",
    "then , solving the differential equations numerically , we have identified the shaded region corresponding to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] in the @xmath17 theory .",
    "figure  [ fig : region04 - 4 ] shows the results from the taylor expansion up to the fourth order in terms of the field ( or the second order in terms of @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is clear that our expectation is manifestly fulfilled : the shaded region is elongated from the unphysical region in the @xmath17 case and spreads almost along the critical line toward the physical region at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "as we will describe in detail in a later section , we have carried out a full numerical calculation without resorting to an expansion by putting the function @xmath67 on a grid of discretized field values .",
    "in this way we can confirm the double - well potential form already reported in the earlier works by berges , tetradis , and wetterich @xcite .",
    "while our method does not surpass the earlier works in precision , we use a regulator that leads to much simpler flow equations .",
    "the line labelled with `` 1st - order '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : region04 - 4 ] represents the phase transition points of fluctuation - induced first order . the strength of the first - order transition weakens with decreasing @xmath56 and eventually it becomes smaller than the resolution in the grid method .",
    "we indicate this by changing the solid line to a dotted one .",
    "we can see that the agreement between the results from the fourth - order taylor expansion and from the full numerical evaluation is limited to a qualitative level .",
    "guided by the expectation that the agreement would be better , we have investigated the phase diagram from the sixth - order taylor expansion .    .",
    "]    we show the results from the sixth - order taylor expansion in fig .  [",
    "fig : region04 - 6 ] . the phase transition line seems to be smoothly connected to the shaded region in this case .",
    "the agreement is , however , not as good as we expected .",
    "[ we have checked that the second minimum in the potential lies in the region where @xmath34 is sufficiently smaller than unity in all the cases , so that the taylor expansion should work in principle . ]",
    "we will discuss the quantitative comparison for the shape of the potential with and without expansion later .",
    "so far , we have seen the results for a fixed choice of @xmath68 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the first - order phase transition is strengthened with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "we can reconfirm this observation by repeating the calculations for larger @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : region07 - 6 ] shows the results for a larger choice of @xmath69 .",
    "we can see that the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : region07 - 6 ] becomes slightly wider than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : region04 - 6 ] .",
    "also the dotted line disappears since the first - order phase transition becomes more prominent and is resolved by the grid in the region shown .    .",
    "]    if we choose even larger values of @xmath59 , we find that the shaded region is pulled not along the critical line , but upward toward larger values of @xmath56 , while the position of the first - order transition line hardly moves .",
    "to make our discussion as self - contained as possible , we shall briefly review the functional rg formalism and the equations we are using in this paper .",
    "the functional rg is an exact formulation of quantum field theories in the form of a functional differential equation  @xcite . in the formulation",
    "we are using , the central object is the effective action which is calculated non - perturbatively . in the functional rg",
    "one defines an average effective action with the ir - cutoff scale @xmath39 . for a general scalar field @xmath70",
    "whose classical counterpart is denoted by @xmath71 here , the @xmath39-dependent effective action is defined by @xmath72 & = -\\log\\biggl [ \\int [ d\\chi]\\ , \\exp \\bigl (    -s[\\chi ] - \\delta s_k [ \\chi - \\phi ] \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\int d^d x\\ ;    \\frac{\\delta\\gamma_k [ \\phi]}{\\delta\\phi(x)}\\ , \\bigl [    \\chi(x)-\\phi(x ) \\bigr ] \\bigr ) \\biggr ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : effective_action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ir - cutoff dependence is introduced by a mass - like term , @xmath73 in momentum space . here we consider @xmath20-dimensional space - time generally .",
    "we note that the momentum - dependent mass @xmath74 should cut off ir modes with @xmath75 .",

    "equation   together with the properties of @xmath74 leads to the boundary condition for the average effective action ; @xmath80=s[\\phi]$ ] where @xmath81 is the uv scale where the rg flow starts , and @xmath82=\\gamma[\\phi]$ ] where @xmath83 $ ] is the full effective action defined in the textbook manner . in principle , the ir - cutoff function can be arbitrary as long as it satisfies the above - mentioned properties . in this paper",
    "we make use of the `` optimized '' choice of @xmath74 @xcite proposed by litim  @xcite , @xmath84 where @xmath85 refers to a @xmath20-dimensional vector in euclidean space - time and @xmath86 is the heaviside step function .",

    "nevertheless , since the derivation assumes no approximation , eq .",

    "the @xmath39-dependent effective potential @xmath94 is a local function of the fields .",
    "this approach is frequently taken in theories involving only scalar fields and is sufficient as long as the anomalous dimension remains small .",

    "is very simple , it encompasses rich contents of the critical phenomena , as we will see later .",
    "we are now ready to proceed to our main subject , i.e.  the fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition . for this purpose",
    "we adapt the @xmath0 scalar theory in @xmath19 dimensions and introduce some notations according to hadron physics .",

    "we can write @xmath116 using the conventional notation in hadron physics ; @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 for the scalar sector and @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 for the pseudo - scalar sector .",
    "[ this @xmath30 does not correspond to the physical @xmath30 in nature but to the flavor - singlet @xmath123 which mixes partially with @xmath124 to become the physical @xmath125 . ] with this notation the lagrangian density in euclidean space - time is expressed as @xmath126 where we find the potential , @xmath127 \\ ; ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : u}\\ ] ] from eq .  .",
    "to simplify the notation in what follows , we introduce the new couplings and variables ; @xmath128 roughly speaking @xmath26 plays the role of the component of @xmath90 that acquires a finite expectation value in the @xmath17 scalar theory and @xmath34 defined above is the counterpart of @xmath129 . using these variables we can rewrite eq .   into a concise representation as follows : @xmath130      the functional rg equation in this system with @xmath0 symmetry has the same form as the generic one   in the previous section .",
    "thus , the functional rg equation in the lpa takes the following form ( with @xmath19 ) : @xmath131 where the energies in the denominator are for @xmath132 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath133 , given with the mass eigenvalues obtained from the potential curvature .",
    "one might imagine that this straightforward procedure should work if @xmath134 is given as an explicit function in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath133 .",
    "in fact , however , the @xmath135 symmetry constrains the potential and @xmath134 is a function of only two independent variables instead of four ; that is , @xmath134 is parametrized by @xmath34 and @xmath136 only as exemplified in eq .  .",
    "below we will elucidate how to read off the expressions for the mass eigenvalues from the derivatives of @xmath137 , which requires a particular strategy for the calculation .",
    "actually taking the second derivative on @xmath137 is just a simple manipulation .",
    "the most non - trivial part lies in the following : the resulting masses are easily expressed in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , and @xmath133 , which must be converted into @xmath34 and @xmath136 in the end .",
    "we can simplify the problem a bit by observing that one field ( @xmath26 in our case ) acquires a non - vanishing expectation value and others have a vanishing expectation value and can be set to zero in the end .",
    "this means that we should take @xmath138 and @xmath139 after writing down the functional rg equations .",

    "we can check if the analytical study in the previous subsection is qualitatively correct by looking at the full functional solution obtained with the grid method . since there is no scaling property expected in the case of the fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition , we plot the results in terms of unscaled variables ( made dimensionless not with @xmath39 but by the uv scale @xmath81 ) .",
