    "interstellar @xmath0-ray emission is produced by interactions of high - energy cosmic rays ( crs ) with the gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the soft interstellar radiation fields .",
    "its observations carry information about cr properties in distant locations and it provides a tracer of the total interstellar gas densities to be compared with radio / mm - wave data : the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen , @xmath2 , and the 2.6-mm line of co , used as a surrogate tracer of molecular mass .",
    "open issues in the understanding of the interstellar @xmath0-ray emission concern the identification and spatial distribution of cr sources and the census of the ism , notably the @xmath1 conversion factor .",
    "the outer galaxy is a privileged observational target since the doppler shift of radio / mm - wave lines due to the galactic rotation unambiguously locates the emitting clouds .",
    "there are two longitude windows with a steep velocity gradient leading to a good kinematic separation @xcite .",
    "we reported analyses of recent measurements by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _",
    "fermi @xmath0-ray space telescope _ @xcite for the second @xcite and third @xcite galactic quadrants .",
    "the component separation based on likelihood fitting allowed us to extract the emissivities per h atom , @xmath3 , and per @xmath4 unit , @xmath5 , in several regions along the lines of sight as described in table  [ tab : regions ] .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the aforementioned papers for details about the analysis and we briefly discuss here the implications of the results for the distribution of crs in the galaxy and the calibration of the @xmath6 ratio .       to alleviate the discrepancy one can increase the cr propagation halo or the radial scale of the cr source distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crprop ] ( left panel ) we varied the halo height , showing that halo heights from 10  kpc to 20  kpc are preferred if the cr source profile is that derived from pulsar and supernova remnant observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crprop ] ( right panel ) we assume a halo height of 4  kpc and we set the cr source density profile to a uniform value beyond a given break radius . we found that @xmath0-ray data point to a flat source distribution beyond @xmath7  kpc .",
    "the solutions are not unique : alternative cr propagation models can be considered , with , _",
    "e.g. _ , a non uniform diffusion coefficient @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath3 might be overestimated due to large amounts of dark gas in the outer disc of the milky way not accounted for by radio / mm - wave data @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged ."
