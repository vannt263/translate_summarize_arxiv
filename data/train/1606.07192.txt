    "an advantage of studying the cluster galaxy population to test theories of galaxy formation is that , once a galaxy has entered a cluster , it will likely remain within a high density environment .",
    "we can therefore trace a more direct evolutionary connection between high redshift and local systems without needing to appeal to abundance matching to link populations at different epochs ( e.g. , @xcite _ et seq . _ ) , where the large intrinsic scatter in galaxy growth rates in simulations implies that one can not unambiguously identify galaxy progenitors and descendants between different observational epochs in the field @xcite .",
    "the homogeneity of cluster samples offers a snapshot of galaxy properties at each epoch , providing a more direct link between galaxy progenitors and descendants . for this reason",
    ", cluster galaxies may serve as an important benchmark for models of galaxy formation and evolution , as well as being useful cosmological probes .",
    "the most distinctive and characteristic population of cluster galaxies at @xmath8 are the cluster red sequence galaxies ( crsgs ) .",
    "they form such a distinctive population that their colours can be used to search for high redshift clusters in wide - field images ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these predominantly early type galaxies have little or no ongoing star formation subsequent to forming the bulk of their stellar populations and assembling their stellar masses at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "however , while their stellar populations and luminosities evolve passively , their morphologies may not , and may also evolve differently from those of similarly passive field galaxies .",
    "for example , a population of dense and compact quiescent galaxies has been identified in the field at high redshift and appears to be much less common nearer the present epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cluster early type galaxies instead appear to have larger sizes than a similarly massive sample of quiescent field galaxies @xcite and to evolve more slowly @xcite .",
    "galaxy size evolution may also have significant environmental dependencies @xcite . in our previous study ( @xcite , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we explored the morphologies of a sample of crsgs drawn from four rich clusters at @xmath10 ( mean redshift @xmath11 ) .",
    "we used deep archival _ hubble space telescope _ imaging in the rest - frame @xmath12 and @xmath13bands ( observed frame @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . the latter passband probes the evolution of structural parameters in a rest - frame band more representative of the stellar mass distribution ( as opposed to earlier studies where the equivalent bandpasses are closer to @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "our data implied even weaker size evolution than previously measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) with no significant size growth compared to the virgo cluster .",
    "while we confirmed the essentially passive evolution of crsgs in colour and luminosity , we also observed that a typical crsg ( with a luminosity around @xmath18 or fainter ) in these @xmath19 clusters has a considerably more disk - like morphology ( lower srsic index , more flattened light distribution ) than its present - day counterparts , structurally closer to that of field spirals . in agreement with this , @xcite also measured more oblate shapes for crsgs in a @xmath20 cluster partly included within the candels dataset , and argued for the presence of increasingly important disk - like components in high redshift cluster galaxies . in the field , luminous quiescent galaxies also appear to contain significant disk - like components @xcite , with at least some of these systems showing evidence of being rotationally supported @xcite .",
    "one possible clue to the mechanisms that convert these high redshift ` disks ' to the more spheroid - dominated population of more local clusters is offered by the existence of significant radial colour gradients .",
    "local early - type galaxies tend to show slightly bluer colours outwards , consistent with the existence of a metal abundance gradient ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the measured colour gradients of @xcite it appears that cluster galaxies are already similar to local early - type galaxies in this respect by @xmath21 .",
    "our sample in paper i showed significantly larger gradients ( also bluer outwards ) at @xmath22 , more consistent with the existence of age gradients and more similar to the evolution seen by @xcite in their sample of disks . together with the evidence for disk - like components and more flattened shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ; see figure 7 in paper i ) , we argued in paper i that a population of recently quenched thin disks transforms into the local population of crsgs ( dominated by e / s0 galaxies ) largely by mechanisms that do not change stellar mass ( given the observed passive evolution of the luminosity function ) or overall sizes ( as those of our sample were broadly consistent with local values as measured in the virgo cluster ) .",
    "possible mechanisms that give rise to these morphological changes include minor mergers , harassment , fly - bys and tidal effects , among many others .",
    "these objects may also be related to the red spirals found locally in the outskirts of the a901/2 supercluster by @xcite and in sdss clusters by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such ` anemic ' spirals with weak spiral structure and low star formation rates were originally identified by @xcite and @xcite in the virgo cluster .",
    "these objects may represent the low redshift counterparts of our high redshify crsgs with significant disk components , and would argue that a process of transformation from field - like spirals to cluster e / s0 may have been taking place in a similar fashion across the past 2/3 of the hubble time .",
    "this also suggests that most crsgs may contain residual disks , a hypothesis supported by earlier photometric work of @xcite and the recent atlas3d dynamical work @xcite .",
    "here we extend this analysis by bridging the intervening redshift range with the full sample of clusters in the clash hst dataset @xcite .",
    "thanks to the multi - band nature of clash , we are able to select our targets in the same way as the targets in paper i , i.e. by rest - frame @xmath23 band luminosity and @xmath24 colour . as before , we also measure structural parameters in ( restframe ) @xmath23 and colour gradients in @xmath24",
    ". we can therefore choose objects over similar magnitude ranges and with very similar stellar populations at all redshifts ( tied by the observed passive evolution in both quantities ) and measure them in the same fashion as our higher redshift galaxies in paper i. this yields a comprehensive survey of crsg structural evolution for objects brighter than @xmath25 ( where m@xmath26 is the magnitude corresponding to @xmath18 in the luminosity function ) , over the last @xmath27 gyr , drawn from a broad sample of clusters , treated in a uniform manner across redshift ( as regards to object selection , use of the same passbands and style of analysis ) .",

    "the red sequence has been commonly used as an indicator of cluster membership , at least for the dominant quiescent population of ( typically ) e / s0 galaxies . as a test of this method , two of our clusters have extensive public redshifts from the clash - vlt survey . in macs1206",

    "therefore , our method selects cluster members with a fidelity exceeding 95% .",
    "of course higher redshift clusters , and fainter galaxies in any clusters , may suffer from somewhat higher contamination , as we have discussed in paper i. since the redshift completeness , even for the clusters in clash - vlt , is no greater than 60% , and not all clash clusters are observable from vlt , we still need to use red sequences to select a sample of cluster members in all our clusters .    by construction",
    ", our red bands are chosen to match the rest - frame @xmath23 band , with a small colour term ( e.g. , as in the example above in figure 2 , the central wavelength of the adopted filter is only 5% different from the actual @xmath23 band ) .",

    "previous work has shown that this model yields a good fit to the observed colours of crsgs across a wide range of redshifts @xcite .",
    "we group the clash clusters into three subsamples : ( i ) fourteen clusters at @xmath53 , the ` low ' subsample ; ( ii ) nine at @xmath54 , the ` mid ' subsample ; ( iii ) two at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the ` high ' sample and combine these with the ` very high ' @xmath10 sample from paper i ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "the relatively small size of the ` high ' sample is due to the paucity of systems observed in the appropriate bands with hst ( acs f814w and wfc3 f125w or f160w ) .",

    "this may be considered as a luminosity _ distribution _ rather than a luminosity _ function _ as we have not removed possible contamination from fore / back - ground objects ( all clusters are studied in different observed bands , not all of which have sufficiently deep , or even any , observations of comparison fields ) . for comparison",

    "the normalisation is chosen arbitrarily to best show the differences in the shapes of the red sequence luminosity distribution across the redshift ranges we study and to provide a local comparison ( this normalisation is usually left to float as it does not have a clear physical meaning for clusters ) .",
    "the average composite luminosity distributions for the crsgs drawn from the ` low ' , ` mid ' and ` high ' subsamples are consistent with the passively evolved schechter functions for local and very high redshift clusters having @xmath60 ( the characteristic magnitude @xmath61 measured in the @xmath23 band shifted to @xmath50 as described above ) and @xmath62 .",
    "the mean number of galaxies in the clash sample in each magnitude bin are also comparable , suggesting that we are typically observing objects of comparable environmental density .",
    "the number counts of galaxies in the high redshift sample of paper i are also broadly consistent with those measured for clash clusters , suggesting that we are not observing objects with very different properties across the redshift range of interest .    given this selection , brighter than an evolved @xmath51 of about 21 ( approximately @xmath63 , or down to about 1/5th the luminosity of the milky way ) we are studying objects that have broadly the same stellar mass and passively evolving stellar populations at all times out to @xmath19 .",
    "the good match to the local luminosity function of @xcite and to the results of paper i confirms the essentially passive evolution of red sequence galaxies in clash clusters . while these results are already well known , their recovery confirms that our selection of the photometrically - defined red sequence galaxies as cluster members is appropriate for the purposes of this study .",
    "therefore , our sample consists of similar galaxies at all redshifts , linked by the observed passive evolution on the red sequence .",
    "to @xmath64 we have a complete sample where we study galaxies of similar luminosity and colour at all redshifts with relatively little contamination from non - cluster sources .",
    "we determine structural parameters for the crsgs in the rest - frame @xmath17 and @xmath23 using galfit @xcite as in our previous analysis of @xmath19 clusters in paper i.    for each galaxy we carry out an interactive and iterative process , where we adopt reasonable starting values and proceed to inspect the model and residuals to ascertain the quality of the fit ( i.e. , we do not run galfit in batch mode , but individually for each object ) .",
    "where necessary , multiple models are run together , e.g. , in the case of close pairs or systems of galaxies .",
    "we adopt a single srsic profile .",
    "this is warranted by the relatively shallow clash data and can also be more easily compared to previous work in cluster and field galaxies . for each image and in each band",
    "we use the median of several bright , unsaturated and isolated ( as possible ) stars to derive a psf ( point spread function ) reference , with min / max clipping of eventual interlopers in the chosen field .",
    "typical psf image sizes are 100 times the fwhm of the psf ( as recommended by the galfit manuals ) .",
    "this procedures ensures that the psf incorporates all processing steps to which the images of the galaxies have been subjected and is therefore preferable to generating artificial psfs ( e.g. , with tinytim ) . for each galaxy being considered the sky level is determined locally within the large aperture needed for analysis by galfit ( including assessment of eventual gradients by fitting a surface to the sky  see below ) .",
    "the results of this procedure are the effective radii ( in restframe @xmath17 and @xmath23 ) , the srsic indices ( also in both bands ) and the axial ratio b / a ( also in @xmath17 and @xmath23 restframe ) . from these",
    "we derive the colour gradient @xmath65 , following the formula given in @xcite using the measured structural parameters in each band .    particularly for the higher redshift samples ,",
    "the pixel scale of the images ( @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) is a significant fraction of the effective radius ( at @xmath68 , @xmath69 corresponds to 8 kpc , with typical galaxies having @xmath70 of 1 kpc , e.g. , @xcite ) and the psf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) has a size comparable to the effective radius ( @xmath71 to @xmath67 depending on the bandpass and instrument used ) .",
    "any 2d profile , e.g. produced with the iraf ellipse package @xcite , will be heavily affected by sampling and by the psf size .",
    "furthermore , mismatches in the galaxy centroids and the different psfs in the red and blue bands ( often using two different instruments : acs in the optical and wfc3 in the infrared ) will result in spurious colour gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using fits to structural parameters from galfit modelling of the full image , automatically removes these sources of error .",
    "we therefore use our derived parameters in the subsequent analysis rather than attempting more detailed profiling .",
    "it is known that the errors output by galfit can sometimes be significant underestimates in the case of small images .",
    "however from the work of @xcite who simulated hst images very similar to those used here , in terms of magnitude , surface brightness and size , it can be seen that galfit will provide values of @xmath70 accurate to within 5% down to magnitude 22.5 , even for steep ( @xmath72 ) profiles .",
    "errors in @xmath73 are @xmath74 at @xmath72 and much less at @xmath75 , while ellipticity errors are typically 0.04 . errors of this size , for the faintest objects we analyse , are sufficiently small that they do not influence any of our results .    in addition , we have run a series of simple simulations of our own with iraf artdata to test our procedures .",
    "these introduce idealised galaxies ( pure exponentials or pure spheroids obeying the devaucouleurs law ) in ` clean ' regions of the images . using galfit on the simulated images",
    "confirmed that parameter errors were of the level noted above or smaller ( the dispersion in values was consistent with the errors returned by galfit , i.e. , within 1% ) and that galfit parameters could be used safely down to the faint limit of our analysed data .",
    "we have further introduced artificial sky gradients to simulate the effects of intracluster light and galfit is found to be insensitive to any such smooth gradients , unless they vary rapidly across the galaxies over scales comparable to the effective radius ; even then , the result is not incorrect parameters but catastrophic failures of the iteration .",
    "when this does not happen , the errors returned are consistent with the galfit output , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "since we actually inspect each object ( model and residuals ) individually , we can rule out the presence of such pathological sky features at any levels that would interfere with the fitting procedure .",

    "the range of colour differences between the old and younger stellar populations , and its evolution with redshift demonstrates that the variation and evolution in colour gradients observed in the population of crsgs can be potentially explained through a combination of metallicity and age - related gradients .",
    "the age - induced gradients decrease with time as both populations converge towards similar colours @xmath119 gyr after the most recent burst , revealing the underlying gradient due to the ( known ) radial metallicity gradients ( see also @xcite for a similar conclusion ) . while similar colours may in principle be achievable if the younger component included some ongoing star formation below @xmath118 , this behaviour is constrained by the lack of evidence for such activity in cluster red sequences below this redshift .",
    "the differential colours shown in fig .",
    "[ models ] are for two components of equal stellar mass . given that specific star formation rates in these galaxies are usually well below @xmath120",

    "a similar argument is presented by @xcite who analyse one of the clusters we studied in paper i and reach consistent conclusions to ours : the presence of an age gradient superposed over a more ancient weak metallicity gradient , although they do not make the explicit connection to the presence of disk - like components .",
    "studying red disks in the sdss @xcite also argue for a quenching timescale of around 23 gyr ( in agreement with our work and @xcite ) and the gradual morphological evolution of the red disks as they move towards cluster centres .",

    "the brightest galaxies in the red sequence appeared to be different , in that their morphological parameters were already closer to local early type ellipticals , indicating any structural evolution was completed at earlier epochs for this brighter subsample .",
    "what was not established in paper i was the timescale over which any morphological transformation occurred in the more typical red sequence galaxies .",
    "the results within this paper help to determine this timescale by exploring the same structural parameters for crsgs drawn from clusters observed at several intervening epochs .    a key result of this work appears to be that for most of the structural parameters in question , any strong evolution has largely been completed by @xmath122 , a look - back time of 56 gyr , and 34 gyr after the latest redshift ( @xmath5 ) that any star formation in the red sequence galaxies is likely to have been quenched ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at higher redshifts",
    "there is good evidence ( albeit limited by the number of systems with useful hst data at @xmath123 ) that the relevant parameters are transitioning between the local distributions and those found in paper i. as the velocity dispersions are already very high in these massive clusters and the luminosity function evolution disfavours significant major merging , this process must take place secularly or by more gentle external inputs ( such as minor mergers or fly - bys ) .",
    "all of this data is consistent with a simple picture outlined in paper i where , after quenching , @xmath121 red sequence galaxies do not evolve in colour and luminosity other than the passive evolution of their stellar populations , but a proportion undergo considerable morphological change over the past 2/3 of the hubble time .",
    "the brightest and more massive cluster spheroids in this sample seem to have already arrived at their final configuration by the beginning of this period ( cf . , @xcite ) but fainter galaxies are likely to show significant evolution , analogous to the observations by @xcite in the candels field",
    ". however , most of our discussion as to the former must be qualitative for now , as there are too few bright galaxies in the small number of high redshift clusters that we observe to draw statistically valid conclusions .    within this picture , the crsg population as a whole appears to become slightly less compact with time ,",
    "although the scale of this growth is significantly less than that seen for passively evolving field galaxies of similar mass over the same time period .",
    "the evolution is reminiscent of that observed in previous studies @xcite , although it may be even weaker , compared to the field , because of the much higher environmental density ( if the trends observed by @xcite can be extended to clusters ) . at the same time crsgs",
    "also become less disk - dominated with decreasing redshift .",
    "the decreasing importance of the disk component is reflected in changes to all of the structural parameters , including the sersic index @xmath73 and the axial ratios .",
    "similarly to @xcite and @xcite we observe an increasing contribution from disk - like components at @xmath104 and somewhat more oblate galaxies , with axial ratios closer to those of spiral disks ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "the brighter and more massive galaxies may constitute a class apart .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies , for instance , are often believed to follow a more distinct evolutionary history than the less massive cluster population .",
    "we show the actual data in fig . 3 , 5 and 7 for all objects . however , if we consider only the 10% brighter ( and likely more massive ) systems , the values for @xmath70 and @xmath73 are consistent with no significant evolution ( i.e. , these bright ellipticals appear to have reached their final status early on in the history of the universe ) but the statistical power afforded by the small number of objects in the highest redshift samples does not suffice to draw strong conclusions on the evolution of these objects .      here",
    "we summarise a strawman model for this evolution which can explain the results described above , and poses further useful questions on the details of this evolution .",
    "this model contains elements that will be familiar to anyone with a knowledge of the early studies of galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the model need not apply to each individual galaxy on the red sequence , rather it describes the evolution necessary within a subset of crsgs in order to produce the changes in the distributions of structural parameters over time .    at high redshift ( @xmath0 )",
    "we begin with a significant fraction of crsgs having disk - like components that are both thin and have younger and more metal poor ( bluer ) stellar populations than their central spheroids .",
    "we associate the disk component with recently quenched star formation seen at @xmath124 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so while it is bluer than the spheroid component , it is in the first stage of passive evolution and its photometric properties evolve rapidly .",
    "the model assumes a metallicity gradient ( e.g. , as for local samples of early - type galaxies ",
    "@xcite ) between the two morphological components , consistent with the many observations of radial metallicity gradients in disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in local disks , one observes metal abundance gradients of 0.2 to 0.6 dex per decade in radius ( from the direct method of line ratios in planetary nebulae and hii regions within resolved disks , as in @xcite ) , which would yield colour gradients ( from fig .",
    "[ models ] ) of the magnitude observed in local samples ( such as the brighter members in coma from @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the metallicity difference on radial colour gradients is only evident at lower redshift as the difference in age of the bulge and disk components dominates at higher redshift .",
    "given the constraint imposed on the overall colours of the galaxies by red sequence selection , the fraction of the mass provided by any disk must be severely constrained , even when there is a colour gradient .",
    "[ models ] shows the colour difference between two equal mass ssp bursts with different formation times .",
    "given the width of the rest - frame @xmath24 red sequence is only a few tenths of a magnitude and includes objects with a range of srsic indices at all redshifts studied here , it is likely that any _ young _ disk component carries no more than @xmath125 per cent of the total stellar mass in a typical csrg .",
    "obviously any extended period of star formation in such a disk has less effect on the overall colour and therefore can contain more of the mass .",
    "@xcite shows how spiral galaxies evolve almost vertically in colour space and rapidly on to the red sequence once their star formation is terminated , in agreement with the scenario presented here , where such objects are present on the red sequence but still preserve their ` spiral ' morphologies , with thin disks .",
    "with increasing time since quenching the disk fades and reddens faster than the older spheroidal population .",
    "after 3 - 4 gyr the difference in colours between the two components is largely dominated by the different metallicities and both fade and redden at approximately the same rate ( as in figure [ models ] ) .",
    "this leads to the decreasing magnitude of and scatter in colour gradient with time . over time",
    "the disk should also thicken to explain the changing axial ratio distribution for the population .",
    "this could simply be caused by the quenched thin disk fading to reveal an underlying thick disk , or other internal and external processes could continually act to thicken the disk .",
    "the precise mechanisms are beyond the scope of this paper and there may be several processes contributing to this , such as disk instabilities or the addition of structure in the outskirts .",
    "however , simulations by @xcite demonstrated that the continual tidal heating suffered by disk galaxies subsequent to their infall into clusters was sufficient to thicken their disks by a factor of @xmath126 over their lifetime in the cluster , effectively transforming the shapes of late type spirals into those of s0s @xcite .",
    "over the same time , and for the same reason , the srsic indices of those systems with the ( initially ) most prominent disks change from @xmath95 to values more consistent with s0 galaxies , @xmath127 , straightforwardly explaining the evolution seen in fig .",
    "[ sersic ] .",
    "a clear implication of this model is that we can link the high redshift crsgs with relatively blue and thin disks to the s0 galaxies with small colour gradients and thicker disks seen to populate cluster red sequences at intermediate and low redshifts at @xmath121 and below .",
    "as the shapes of galaxies selected morphologically as e / s0 by @xcite do not change over time , our disk - like red sequence galaxies must naturally evolve to resemble present - day e / s0s .",
    "a key recent work on the low redshift cluster s0 population is that of @xcite , exploring the parameters of this population in the coma cluster .",
    "the simple model outlined here produces galaxies with photometric properties consistent with those determined by @xcite .",
    "note that because s0 galaxies exist on the red sequences of clusters at all redshifts , the model does not imply that all low redshift cluster s0s formed in this manner between @xmath128 , merely that the s0 population was significantly augmented over this time .",
    "and therefore little evidence for bulge growth , scaledwidth=50.0% ]      there are several significant issues that are not constrained by this simple model and the existing data .",
    "the first is the reason for the quenching of star formation in disk components .",
    "this could simply be attributed to a loss of fuel after infall into the cluster . as ever , suspects for such cluster - centric mechanisms include ram pressure stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , virial shock heating @xcite and strangulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) amongst others .",
    "alternatively , it could be due to a secular process , such as morphological quenching @xcite , where the spheroidal component of a galaxy grows to a size sufficient to stabilise the disk against further star formation .",
    "so long as star formation in any disk is ended by @xmath9 , any of these mechanisms may result in the systems at @xmath10 identified in paper i having disk - like components .",
    "a second issue is that of bulge growth . although the model above was framed in terms of disk fading , because we are measuring the evolution in relative strength of bulge and disk components with time there could equally be a rle for bulge growth in this evolution",
    "work has recently been presented on the maturity of bulges and the quenching of star formation in @xmath129 star forming galaxies drawn from a range of environments @xcite .",
    "this indicated that these systems quench star formation from the inside out and that their central ( bulge ) surface densities are already comparable to those of similar stellar mass @xmath86 early type galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath130 , and within a factor of two of the @xmath86 values even for lower mass systems .",
    "the implication is that barring any subsequent mass growth through mergers , the bulges of galaxies with similar masses to those explored here are already largely in place by @xmath131 .",
    "the crsgs explored in paper i and here either originated in the field and subsequently fell in to their clusters , or formed in an accelerated manner in existing high density regions as part of the original growth of the hosting clusters ; it might be expected that their central spheroidal components are already in place before any disk component starts to quench .",
    "given the already - noted limit to how much mass can be in any relatively young stellar disk given the narrow colour range in cluster red sequences , coupled with the lack of growth of total stellar mass in the same galaxies since @xmath5 ( paper i ) , it would seem that the bulges would have to be in place by @xmath5 .",
    "however , that does not account for any older disk component which could evolve morphologically , growing the bulge through inflow of stars and other material over time .    in order to test this we determine the luminosity in the @xmath23 band within the central 1 kpc ( @xmath132 ) for each galaxy by integrating its fitted sersic profile out to this point .",
    "this may be thought of as a proxy for the central density ( as used by , e.g. , @xcite in their study of low redshift transitioning ` green valley ' galaxies ) .",
    "results are plotted as histograms in fig  [ concentration ] .",
    "the distribution of this  density ; measure is essentially the same for the ` low ' and ` mid ' redshift subsamples , implying no evolution in central density at @xmath93 ( see also @xcite .",
    "the corresponding histogram for the ` high ' subsample shows if anything a higher typical central concentration .",
    "however , given only two clusters contribute , this could easily be attributable to shot noise from cluster to cluster .",
    "only a small fraction of objects at this redshift have concentrations below the mean , suggesting that the inner regions of the galaxy population have been built by this epoch .",
    "the ` very high ' sample may be different from the others : there is a relative lack of bright ` bulges ' but the small number statistics and the increased uncertainty in each measurement caused by the relatively large size of the wfc3/@xmath133 psf in comparison to the effective radii of galaxies make interpretation of this plot difficult without more data .",
    "consequently , it appears that the high central densities of the spheroidal components of the crsgs are in place by @xmath134 .",
    "the origin of the outer , younger , more metal poor material is more uncertain : as an example , it may itself have been accreted through minor mergers at an earlier epoch ( before @xmath117 ) , perhaps even during pre - processing of galaxies before they join the main cluster . from both the limited results on concentration obtained here and the arguments based on the work of @xcite , it is likely that the spheroidal components of most of the @xmath10 crsgs are already in place",
    "this would imply that the decrease in the contribution from disk - like components in the population over the 3 - 4 gyr between @xmath5 and @xmath135 was mainly or solely due to the fading or rearrangement of the disks and not from the buildup of a bulge component ( or at least the central regions of any bulge ) .",
    "this evolution in the disks may be triggered by disk instabilities , tides , harassment , fly - bys and a series of other external and internal processes we are not in a position to explore here .",
    "a further indication that the morphological transformation may be due to changes in the disk , is the concurrent evolution observed in the axial ratios and srsic indices , which tend to reinforce our impression that the spheroidal portion of these galaxies has been established at early times and only the younger , and perhaps more fragile , disks appear to be involved in the morphological changes we observe .",
    "one result that does not directly follow from the strawman model is the ( albeit small ) increase in the typical size ( @xmath70 ) of the crsg population between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "if a disks fades and reddens relative to its bulge , with no large - scale change to the bulge structure it would be expected that the overall @xmath70 would probably decrease ( albeit by a modest amount ) rather than increase , in the absence of any other morphological evolution .",
    "given the small size of any evolution , it could be explained by other evolutionary effects in only a subset of the comparatively small ` high ' and ` very high ' subsamples .",
    "we note here that the strawman model does not account for this potential behaviour , but is certainly not currently ruled out by it .",
    "for instance , it is possible that any size evolution in the overall crsg population could be driven by galaxies other than those which are evolving morphologically in the manner discussed here .",
    "alternatively , one may envisage the disk being disturbed , for instance by minor mergers or fly - bys , and then added on to the outer regions of the bulge , thus driving a modest increase in size and srsic index as structure is increased in the outer regions , and reducing the oblateness of galaxies .",
    "such fly - bys would be frequent in the dense environment of clusters and may result in significant structural changes in halos @xcite .",
    "disk instability would be another possibility ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the model by @xcite , for instance , galaxies are born as highly flattened objects and their disks are later on destroyed or rearranged by interactions and mergers with minor satellites ( e.g. , @xcite ) to form a more spheroid - dominated population .",
    "several other mechanisms are possible , as discussed in the vast literature on size growth of spheroids , but we are not in a position here to speculate",
    ".    a clear improvement to the analysis presented here would be to carry out detailed two - component surface brightness fitting to crsgs over the entire redshift range and perhaps beyond @xmath5 where the analysis may need to be extended to slightly bluer galaxies due to the increased influence of star formation in red sequence progenitors .",
    "this is not reliably achievable with the current hst data , especially at high redshift where the most changes are seen ( cf .",
    "deeper exposures could be obtained with hst . however , an equally important issue is to be able to resolve the galaxies on scales smaller than @xmath70 in the reddest bands .",
    "higher spatial resolution will allow the analysis to separate out any disk and bulge component and therefore to securely determine how much of the observed evolution is caused by bulge growth and how much to disk fading .",
    "this will be straightforwardly achievable with jwst .",
    "we have explored the morphological evolution of cluster red sequence galaxies using a large sample of such galaxies drawn from multiple clusters over the redshift range @xmath1 split into four subsamples by redshift .",
    "our previous work showed there were significant differences between the populations at @xmath10 and @xmath138 . here",
    "we fill in details of their evolution over the intervening 9 - 10 gyr .",
    "our major findings are :    * we confirm that the distribution in structural parameters of high redshift cluster galaxies differs from those at lower redshift .",
    "at least a proportion of the population evolves morphologically having arrived on the red sequence subsequent to quenching of star formation . *",
    "the measurements indicate that this evolution largely ends by @xmath122 , a lookback time of 5 - 6 gyr and a likely 3 - 4 gyr after quenching of star formation .",
    "this evolution is seen in the distribution of srsic parameters , axial ratios , sizes and colour gradients . *",
    "the evolution in each of these parameters indicates typical objects become less disk - dominated with time , with the strength of any colour gradient ( bluer on the outside ) decreasing similarly .",
    "the data broadly fit a simple model where ( thin ) disk components fade and redden more quickly than their central bulges , straightforwardly explained by more recent quenching of star formation in the disk than in the bulge .",
    "the timescale for this matches the @xmath139 gyr over which we can detect changes in the structural parameters . during this time",
    "the disks are required to thicken in order to explain the changing axial ratio distribution , agreeing with the timescale for the expected tidal thickening of disks in clusters .",
    "the obvious implication of the model is that these initially disk - dominated galaxies are the progenitors of the passive s0 systems that populate ( indeed dominate ) the red sequence of intermediate and low redshift clusters at luminosities around @xmath18 and below ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "* we confirm that the size growth in the population of red sequence galaxies in clusters is significantly less over the past @xmath140 gyr than that of similar mass passively - evolving field galaxies .",
    "the data indicate that any growth is likely to occur at @xmath109 as the size distributions of our two lower redshift subsamples appear indistinguishable . *",
    "while the decreasing prominence of any disk component could have a contribution from bulge growth over time , consideration of the fraction of the luminosity ( mass ) within the central 1kpc of each galaxy indicates that at least to @xmath134 this is not a significant factor in the evolution of the measured structural parameters . *",
    "although further similar hst data sets ( with both rest - frame @xmath12 and @xmath13band imaging ) for @xmath109 clusters would improve the statistical significance of some of these results , improvements in the interpretation of these results will only come from the ability to securely fit multi - component surface brightness profiles to high redshift samples .",
