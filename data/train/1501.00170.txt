    "schottky interfaces between graphene ( gr ) and semiconductors are relevant for future applications in electronic devices such as solar cells , high speed logic gates , photodetectors , three - terminal transistors , hot electron based devices etc .",
    "@xcite . a key requisite is to fabricate such schottky interfaces with low leakage current in reverse bias and a high current in forward bias in order to obtain stable and highly rectifying diodes @xcite .",
    "recently , a three - terminal  graphene - barristor \" was demonstrated based on tunable schottky barrier across electrostatically gated gr / si interface @xcite , using large area chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) grown graphene .",
    "although cvd graphene interfaces are found to have an advantage over their exfoliated counterparts due to their large area and easier fabrication methods , gr / si schottky interfaces using exfoliated graphene have also been fabricated @xcite .",
    "usually for both types of interfaces made by either exfoliated or cvd graphene , the rectification , which is the ratio between forward saturation current and reverse saturation current ( @xmath3 ) is reported to be quite low ( @xmath410@xmath5 ) and accompanied by a large ideality factor , @xmath6 of @xmath45 to @xmath433 , primarily in exfoliated graphene diodes at room temperature @xcite .",
    "such a low value of the rectification can arise due to the weak bonding between graphene and si during fabrication causing high reverse leakage current and reducing the diode quality .",

    "we analyse the temperature dependence of the diode characteristics and find that features in the forward bias regime can be associated with inhomogeneities at the gr / n - si interfaces arising due to potential fluctuations in graphene because of ripples @xcite , relatively high conduction at the edge and graphene grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the temperature dependence of transport for both types of gr / n - si interface will be important for their implementation in diverse electronic devices .",
    "for the exfoliated - gr / si device , the graphene flake is exfoliated on top of a n - si / sio@xmath7 ( 300 nm ) substrate as shown in fig .",

    "a second lithography step opens up a window in the pmma mask in between the two electrodes .",
    "the substrate with the clamped graphene layer is then dipped in buffered hydrofluoric acid ( bhf ) to remove the 300 nm of sio@xmath7 , followed by immersing it in deionized ( di ) water .",
    "this leads to a contact between the si surface and the clamped graphene when the substrate is taken out of the di water and left to dry .",
    "we noticed that the graphene flake becomes non - suspended and forms a robust contact with si when the electrode separation is more than 2 @xmath10 m and can withstand further cleaning of the pmma by hot acetone and isopropanol as shown in fig .  [",

    "we must note that the cvd - graphene devices were annealed overnight at 150@xmath20 c to remove the contaminants and to improve the diode quality as all fabrication steps were done subsequent to the gr / si interface formation unlike in the case for exfoliated graphene devices .",

    "represents purely te process . in general",
    ", the schottky barrier height represents the difference between the graphene work function ( @xmath32 ) and the electron affinity of si ( @xmath33 ) i.e. , @xmath32 - @xmath33 = ( 4.8 - 4.05 ) ev = 0.75 ev @xcite .",
    "we note however that the work function of graphene is reported to vary from 4.4 to 4.8 ev ( refs .",
    "12 and 13 ) due to unintentional doping of graphene , thus leading to a wide distribution of sbh at different gr / n - si interfaces",
    ". further , the presence of a thin layer of oxide at the interface during fabrication can result in an incomplete hydrogen passivation of the si surface , creating interface states and dipoles with graphene .",
    "these result in an ideality factor greater than unity and a modification of the schottky barrier @xcite , @xmath21 = @xmath32 - @xmath33 + @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the voltage drop due to interface dipoles .",
    "the difference in the barrier height and the ideality factor for the exfoliated - graphene and cvd - graphene devices are due to differences in the fabrication processes in addition to the differences in graphene quality which in principle can change the interface dipoles .",
    "to compare the quality of the graphene in our devices , we additionally fabricate graphene field effect transistors ( fets ) on similar n - si / sio@xmath7 substrates .",
    "we extract typical mobilities ( @xmath10 ) at room temperature to be around 2200 @xmath36v@xmath37s@xmath37 for exfoliated graphene and around 300 @xmath36v@xmath37s@xmath37 for cvd - graphene respectively at similar charge carrier densities of 4@xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath28 for both and find them to be p - doped .",
    "we note that exfoliated graphene has better mobility ( @xmath40 ) associated with high conductivity ( @xmath41 ) than cvd - graphene for similar carrier densities .    in case of a non - ideal diode ( @xmath6@xmath131 )",
    ", there might be image force lowering of the barrier along with other transport channels such as thermionic field emission ( tfe ) and direct tunneling in addition to te , which will modify the barrier height . as the doping concentration of n - si is @xmath42 @xmath9 , we can safely rule out direct tunneling , as the calculated width of the depletion layer , @xmath43 ( @xmath131 @xmath10 m ) is too large at rt @xcite . for a better understanding of the transport characteristics ,",
    "we also perform temperature dependence of _ i - v _ for both diodes .",
    "the _ i - v _ characteristics of the exfoliated gr / n - si schottky diode in the temperature range 80 - 300 k is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tdep_both](a ) .",
    "the forward bias @xmath15_-v _ plots show a clear linear regime for the entire temperature range .",
    "a gradual increase of the onset voltage ( @xmath44 forward - voltage at which the current starts to increase sharply ) is observed from @xmath40.1 v ( 300 k ) to @xmath40.8 v ( 80 k ) with a decrease in temperature .",
    "this is because of the decrease in the thermal energy ( @xmath24 t ) of electrons [ from 26 mev ( at 300 k ) to 7 mev ( at 80 k ) ] .",
    "the values of @xmath21 and @xmath6 are extracted by fitting the linear part of the forward current ( by eq .",
    "1 ) for all temperatures and plotted as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep_both](b ) . with decreasing temperature , the extracted ideality factor is found to increase ( from 1.54 to 3.66 ) , while the zero - bias barrier height decreases ( from 0.69 to 0.34 ev ) .",
    "similar measurements are also obtained for cvd gr / n - si device and are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep_both](c ) . here",
    "too , we observe a gradual shift in the onset voltage towards higher bias when lowering the temperature which is consistent with the decrease in thermal energy of the electrons .",
    "however , the forward saturation current is now limited by the graphene quality and the quality of the gr / si interface as compared to the exfoliated graphene devices .",
    "a linear fit can be done for only few measurement points .",
    "the extracted @xmath21 and @xmath6 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdep_both](d ) as a function of temperature .",
    "a similar trend as observed for exfoliated graphene device is found here with @xmath6 increasing from 2.61 to 4.24 and @xmath21 decreasing from 0.83 to 0.42 ev upon decreasing temperature .",
    "the above results can be understood by considering the current transport across the gr / n - si interface to be a temperature activated process . at low temperatures , for inhomogeneous gr / si interfaces ,",
    "transport is dominated by the low schottky barrier patches while with increasing temperature , more electrons have sufficient energy to surmount the higher barriers and the extracted effective barrier increases .",
    "although reports of such temperature dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath6 exist in other metal / semiconductor ( m / s ) interfaces @xcite , no clear explanation other than the consideration of an inhomogeneous distribution of barrier heights has been proposed @xcite . for gr / si interfaces , inhomogeneity in barrier heights",
    "arise due to local modification of graphene work function by the non - uniform interface charge distribution caused by unavoidable potential fluctuations due to ripples @xcite and/or formation of graphene grain boundaries @xcite etc .",
    "zero - bias barrier height and the ideality factor versus @xmath45 curves for exfoliated - graphene / si schottky diode ( a ) and cvd - graphene / si schottky diode ( b ) , respectively .",
    "fits show two clearly observable temperature dependent regimes ( i and ii ) for both diodes . ]    a quantitative analysis of the mean barrier heights are further estimated by the werner - gttler model @xcite , which takes into account the inhomogeneous distribution of the measured zero - bias barrier height , @xmath21 . according to the model",
    ", the gaussian distribution of @xmath21 yields the following equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean barrier height , and @xmath48 is the standard deviation of the barrier distribution . a plot of @xmath21 vs. @xmath49",
    "therefore should yield a straight line with an intercept and a slope corresponding to @xmath47 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the corresponding temperature dependence of the ideality factor , @xmath6 becomes @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( dimensionless ) and @xmath53 are temperature independent voltage coefficients which quantify the voltage deformation of the barrier height distribution .",
    "similarly , the plot of @xmath54 vs. @xmath49 should show a linear dependence with an intercept and a slope which depend on the voltage coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "figure 5 presents a combined plot of @xmath54 on the left y - axis and @xmath21 on the right y - axis vs. @xmath49 as common the x - axis .",
    "as can be seen from figure 5 , the linear dependence according to equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) has two distinct temperature regimes ( i and ii ) for both graphene diodes .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath47 and @xmath48 after fitting by equation ( 2 ) are summarized in table  [ table : t_phi_n ] .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath48 , is a measure of the barrier inhomogeneity ; a large value of @xmath48 corresponds to a more inhomogeneous distribution of the schottky barrier heights .",
    "the values of @xmath48 are significant compared to the @xmath47 , which indicates strong inhomogeneities at both the interfaces and relatively larger inhomogeneities for the diode with cvd graphene than exfoliated graphene , as expected .",
    "most importantly , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are smaller in regime - ii than regime - i , which indicate the stabilization of the potential fluctuation at low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the temperature dependence of the ideality factor using equation ( 3 ) and calculate the voltage coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which are also summarized in table  [ table : t_phi_n ] .    the linear dependence of the experimental results with the potential fluctuation model in two different temperature regimes suggests a broad distribution of the schottky barrier heights in both cases .",

    "realization of an optimal schottky interface for graphene on si is quite challenging as the barrier height strongly depends on the graphene quality and the fabrication processes employed . such interfaces , unlike other m / s interfaces are found to be thermally and chemically stable in all environments @xcite and are relatively easy to fabricate .",
