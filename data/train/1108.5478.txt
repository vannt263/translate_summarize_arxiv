    "graphene  a monolayer of carbon atoms  possesses unusual physical properties that make it attractive for various applications.@xcite usually treated as a platform for the novel high - speed electronics,@xcite graphene is of great interest from the point of view of the fundamental physics as well .",
    "indeed , the low - energy electron excitations in graphene are massless dirac fermions with the linear energy spectrum , @xmath0.@xcite that makes graphene a condensed - matter playground for the study of various relativistic quantum phenomena , such as the klein tunnelling @xcite and the casimir effect.@xcite up to now , most of graphene - related studies were focused on its unusual transport properties , and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects arising from interaction of electrons in graphene with a quantized electromagnetic field were neglected.@xcite this paper is aimed to fill partially this gap in the theory .",
    "we show that due to the giant fermi velocity of electrons in graphene , @xmath1 , qed effects are pronounced and can lead to qualitative modifications of the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "the linear energy spectrum of electrons in graphene comes from its specific honeycomb lattice structure which makes the band gap between the valence and conductivity bands to be exactly zero.@xcite there is the long - standing problem of the opening of the band gap .",
    "the appearance of a controllable band gap is required for various electronical and optical applications of graphene.@xcite aside from this , it is interesting from the fundamental viewpoint to analyze how massless dirac fermions can acquire a mass .",
    "this question is relevant , particularly , in the context of the observation of majorana fermions in condensed matter systems.@xcite several mechanisms of the band gap opening in monolayer graphene have been proposed . among them",
    "are breaking of the symmetry between two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice of graphene,@xcite the spin - orbit coupling @xcite and the many - body interactions leading to the excitonic instability.@xcite    recently , one of us put forward the proposal of opening the band gap by illuminating graphene with a circularly polarized light.@xcite in this case the gap in the spectrum of elementary electron excitations appears due to the formation of composite electron - photon states which are similar to polaritons in ionic crystals and quantum microcavities.@xcite it should be noted that , within the framework of qed , the electron - photon interaction can be observed even if `` real '' photons are absent and electrons interact only with vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field due to emitting and reabsorbing virtual photons.@xcite therefore , one can expect that the photon - induced splitting of valence and conductivity bands in graphene @xcite will take place due to the vacuum fluctuations even in the absence of an external field pumping .",
    "this qed effect is similar to the well - known lamb shift in the atomic physics , i.e. , the vacuum - induced splitting of the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 of a hydrogen atom with the characteristic splitting energy @xmath4 @xmath5ev . the lamb shift , discovered experimentally by lamb and retherford @xcite and theoretically explained by bethe",
    "@xcite more than 60 years ago , is extremely important for understanding and verification of basic principles of qed .",
    "that is why it attracts the undivided attention of the physics community up to now.@xcite    since clockwise and counterclockwise polarized photons shift electron levels in graphene in mutually opposite directions,@xcite the band gap opening needs breaking the symmetry between virtual photons with different circular polarizations .",
    "this can be achieved by placing a graphene monolayer inside a planar cavity filled with an optically active material ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as it will be shown below , in this case",
    "the vacuum fluctuations lead to the opening of the band gap in graphene even in the absence of an external circularly polarized optical pumping .",
    "it should be noted , that the qed mass renormalization in an optically active media has been considered,@xcite but , surprisingly , the most interesting case of massless dirac fermions was not analyzed before .     and",
    "@xmath6 correspond to clockwise and counterclockwise circularly polarized virtual photons , respectively , which are emitted and reabsorbed by electrons in graphene . ]",
    "let us consider the problem of interaction between a single electron in graphene and a single photon mode of a planar microcavity .",
    "generally , electron states in graphene near the fermi energy are described by the eight - component wave function which accounts for two elementary sublattices of graphene , two electron valleys , and two orientations of electron spin.@xcite in what follows intervalley scattering processes and spin - flip effects will be beyond consideration , which reduces the number of necessary components of wavefunction to two .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian of electron in graphene coupled to the cavity mode reads ( see the appendix a for details of the derivation ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the photonic part of the hamiltonian written in the basis of circularly polarized states , @xmath9 is the electron hamiltonian near the point where the valence and conductivity bands of graphene touch each other ( the dirac point ) and    @xmath10\\ ] ]    is the hamiltonian of electron - photon interaction in the cavity . for definiteness , we assume the graphene sheet to be placed in the center of the cavity . in eqs .",

    "the pauli vector operator , @xmath23 , acts in the space of two orthogonal electron states , @xmath24 , corresponding to the two sublattices of graphene in accordance with the following rules : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "thus , it corresponds to the _ pseudospin _ of electron .",
    "eigenstates of the electron hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) are given by the expression @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the signs @xmath11 correspond to electron states in the conductivity and valence bands of graphene ( the upper and lower dirac cones , respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenstates of the photon hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) can be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are photon occupations number for photons with different circular polarizations ( @xmath11 ) and wave vectors @xmath33 .",
    "then eigenstates of the full electron - photon hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be decomposed in the basis of the orthogonal electron - photon states @xmath34 in order to find eigenstates and eigenenergies of the full hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , we will use the perturbation theory , considering the interaction hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) as a perturbation . to calculate the energy corrections in the lowest order of the perturbation",
    ", one needs to find the eigenvalues of the @xmath35 matrix @xmath36 having matrix elements @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that all matrix elements of this type are zero and one needs to use the second order of the perturbation theory .",
    "physically , we need to account for the following processes : the electron with a wave vector @xmath38 emits a virtual photon with a momentum @xmath33 and then reabsorbs it .",
    "note , that in such a process the momentum of the electron in the initial state , @xmath38 , should be equal to its momentum in the final state , but the value of the index @xmath39 can be changed : the electron can remain in the same dirac cone or move from one dirac cone to another one .",
    "the last process becomes efficient around @xmath40 point where the energies of the dirac cones are close to each other , which can lead to the lifting of the degeneracy as we show below .",
    "therefore , to calculate the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , we need to use the perturbation theory for degenerate states .",
    "let us briefly remind how the second - order corrections can be accounted for within the framework of perturbation theory for degenerate states ( the details can be found , e.g. , in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "imagine that we have a set of states @xmath41 which are close in energy to each other ( this means that the energy distances @xmath42 between them are comparable or smaller relative to a characteristic energy of the perturbation ) .",
    "the perturbation does not couple any states @xmath43 and @xmath44 directly ( otherwise the standard first - order perturbation theory is applicable ) , but couples them to a set of the states @xmath45 whose energies lie far from energies of the states @xmath41 ( this means that the energy distances @xmath46 are large as compared with the characteristic energy of the perturbation ) . in our case",
    "the set @xmath41 consists of the two states @xmath47 , and the set @xmath45 corresponds to the states @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",

    "the physical meaning of the terms in the hamiltonian ( [ eh ] ) is the following .",
    "the matrix element @xmath64 corresponds to the process : an electron in the upper dirac cone emits a virtual photon and then reabsorbs this photon while returning to the same cone .",
    "the matrix element @xmath65 corresponds to the same process for the electron in the lower dirac cone .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath66 correspond to the processes in which the electron after reabsorption of the photon changes the dirac cone .",

    "the solid lines correspond to the electrons and the dashed lines correspond to the virtual photons .",
    "index @xmath63 denotes the two different circular polarizations of the photons , and the index @xmath67 denoted the two different dirac cones .",
    "summation should be performed over both the indices @xmath68 and @xmath39 . ]",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eh ] ) gives the renormalized energy spectrum of the elementary excitations in graphene , @xmath69 taking into account that at @xmath40 we have @xmath70 , the renormalized electron energy ( [ f ] ) at the dirac point can be written as @xmath71 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) that the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field in the cavity can open the band gap between the conductivity and valence bands of graphene at the dirac point , which is @xmath72 it should be stressed that in the absence of an optically active media , the eigenfrequencies of clockwise and counterclockwise circularly polarized photons are equal , @xmath73 . according to the equation ( [ hpm ] ) , in this case the term @xmath74 is zero and the band gap ( [ g ] ) vanishes .",
    "therefore for the band gap opening one needs to fill the cavity by an optically active media which splits modes of virtual photons with different circular polarizations . in this case",

    ", one needs to perform the summation over all modes @xmath78 in eqs .",
    "( [ hpp])([hpm ] ) . keeping in mind that photon modes with even numbers @xmath78 correspond to the zero field intensity in the center of the cavity and , thus",

    "it is seen that eq .",
    "( [ gapmultimode ] ) contains the summation over photon polarizations , @xmath63 .",
    "as expected , the contributions of clockwise and counterclockwise polarized photons in the band gap ( [ gapmultimode ] ) have opposite signs and the band gap vanishes for @xmath86 and appears only in the presence of an optically active media with @xmath87 .",
    "for instance , the cavity can be filled with a magneto - gyrotropic media based on ferrite garnets which possess the giant difference between the velocities of light with different circular polarizations.@xcite the effect becomes even more pronounced if the cavity is filled with an active media with the circular dichroism.@xcite in this case one of the two circularly polarized photon modes in the cavity is suppressed and its contribution to the band gap ( [ gapmultimode ] ) can be neglected . as a result , the summation over @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ gapmultimode ] ) can be omitted , which leads to the drastic increasing of the band gap .    ;",
    "( b ) energy spectrum of free electrons in graphene ( dashed lines ) and electrons dressed by virtual photons ( solid lines ) .",
    "the calculation is performed for the cavity length @xmath88 nm and the number of accounted cavity modes is @xmath89 . ]",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows the dependence of the band gap , @xmath90 , on the cavity length , @xmath18 , for the cavity filled by such a media with the circular dichroism . in the physically relevant region of the cavity lengths ( the white area in fig . [ fig3](a ) ) , the band gap calculated in the single - mode approximation ( @xmath91 ) is of several @xmath5ev , which is comparable with the lamb shift.@xcite the summation over higher modes increases this value by 12 orders of magnitude : for 100 modes the value of the band gap increases to 50100 @xmath5ev , while the summation over all modes gives value of about 200 @xmath5ev .",
    "however , the summation over infinite number of modes overestimates the band gap . indeed ,",
    "if the characteristic photon wavelength , @xmath92 , is comparable to the interatomic distance , the macroscopic description of an optically active media becomes irrelevant .",
    "therefore the band gap can be reasonably estimated to be about tens of @xmath5ev , that is one order of magnitude bigger than the lamb shift.@xcite    the energy spectrum of massive dirac fermions in graphene is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the renormalized dispersion relation can be approximated by the analytical expression @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noted that the considered single - electron problem can be easily generalized for the realistic situation when the valence band is filled by the fermi sea of electrons . in this case",
    "the pauli principle forbids virtual transitions into the lower dirac cone filled with electrons , which reduces both the matrix elements ( [ hpp])([hpm ] ) and the band gap ( [ gapmultimode ] ) by the factor of @xmath94 .",
    "we predicted the quantum electrodynamical effect in graphene placed inside a planar cavity filled by an optically active media . due to the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field in the cavity , the spectrum of elementary excitations in graphene undergoes qualitative changes .",
    "namely , the valence and conductivity bands of graphene are split at the dirac points .",
    "the value of the vacuum - induced band gap can be one order of magnitude bigger then the famous lamb shift in hydrogen atom .",
