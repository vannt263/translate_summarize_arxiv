    "over the past 20 years , microlensing , in which gravitational lensing causes a transient increase in the flux from a background point source , has been used to search for dark and compact objects @xcite , to study galactic structure and kinematics @xcite , to determine the shape of stars @xcite , and to identify extrasolar planets ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such studies were once limited by the small number of detected events , but thanks to advances in ccd technology and the development of dedicated microlensing surveys , a few thousand events are now observed each year . in the coming decade , this number is expected to increase as the next generation of photometric , time - domain surveys comes online , providing an opportunity for the precise study of otherwise hard - to - characterize objects , such as low - mass stars , sub - stellar objects , and isolated neutron stars .",
    "microlensing surveys typically focus on high - density stellar regions , such as the galactic bulge , m31 , or the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but microlensing events are not limited to dense stellar fields . indeed ,",
    "lensing events away from these fields are potentially very interesting .",
    "while the microlensing event rate in low - density stellar regions will be smaller , compared to events found by modern microlensing surveys , these are expected to involve closer sources and lenses , and less crowded backgrounds @xcite .",
    "thus , such lenses offer more opportunities to constrain the properties of the events .        only one event outside of a dense stellar field has been recorded to date : the tago event @xcite , a serendipitous detection of the microlensing of a bright source .",
    "@xcite set probabilistic limits on the mass , distance , proper motion , and magnitude of this lens using existing observations near the event s location , and further observations may turn these limits into precise measurements .",
    "such an analysis is usually not possible for events in high - density fields where the lenses are , on average , much farther away and blending makes photometry  and , therefore , mass measurements  challenging .",
    "by contrast , high - galactic - latitude events probe lenses with distances @xmath71  kpc ; the einstein radii , therefore , tend to be larger ( @xmath0milliarcseconds ) and may cause detectable astrometric signatures @xcite . a measurement of the astrometric shift due to microlensing will break the distance - mass degeneracy in the lensing parameters and enable a direct measurement of the lens mass . finding even a handful of nearby lenses that can be studied in the same kind of detail as the tago event would",
    ", therefore , be very valuable .    in this paper",
    ", we use the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) survey , described in section  [ sec : ptf ] , as a test case for studying the frequency and detectability of microlensing events in all - sky , irregularly sampled , time - domain surveys .",
    "although to date no microlensing event has been reported using ptf data , a simple extrapolation from previous all - sky rate estimates suggests @xmath0110 detectable microlensing events within the ptf footprint over the survey s three years of operation @xcite .",
    "we examine the selection methods used by microlensing surveys to identify event signatures in light curves as well as an event identification procedure based on a set of variability statistics .",
    "we then present the detection efficiency for these methods as computed for a representative set of ptf fields ( section  [ sec : event_recovery ] ) . in section  [ sec :",

    "the imaging cadences range from 1 - 5 days , but other cadences are possible : for example , there was a higher - cadence campaign of a field in orion to find transiting planets around young stars @xcite .",
    "the result is that ptf light curves often contain gaps and regions of high - cadence observations and/or of low - cadence observations , so that the archive is a massive dataset of irregularly - sampled , time - domain photometry .",

    "given the exposure distribution , which peaks at 30 - 40 but includes a long tail to larger numbers , we restrict our sample to the light curves with @xmath410 _ r_-band observations .",
    "microlensing surveys typically use difference image analysis @xcite to identify transient events in raw imaging data",
    ". the light curves of transient sources are then analyzed and vetted using a variety of selection methods to search for microlensing event candidates and distinguish them from , e.g. , variable stars , outbursting systems , and novae .",
    "surveys have approached this process differently ( as described in @xcite ) , but the general idea is to require that :    1 .",
    "any selected light curve has some number of consecutive data points brighter than some threshold , 2 .",
    "compared to flat or linear light - curve models , a microlensing model best describe the data , and 3 .",
    "the microlensing model event parameters have physically reasonable values .    what would a microlensing event look like in a typical ptf light curve ? if the source is an unblended point source and the lens is a foreground , dim object , a microlensing event is fully described by three parameters : the angular impact parameter @xmath20 , the peak time of the event @xmath21 , and the timescale of the event ( einstein crossing time ) @xmath22 . in terms of a dimensionless projected distance between the source and lens ( in units of einstein radius ) , @xmath23 ,",
    "the amplification factor @xmath24 and flux @xmath25 as a function of time can be defined as : @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the microlensing perturbation can also be expressed as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unperturbed , but possibly time - variable , magnitude of the source .    even in cases of high amplification ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "a survey may miss or poorly sample an event if @xmath22 is short ( @xmath30 ) , while if @xmath22 is long ( @xmath31 ) the event may be confused with other forms of long - duration variability .",
    "figure  [ fig : microlensing_sim ] illustrates the effect of simulated microlensing events with a fixed @xmath32 , but different angular impact parameter , @xmath20 , on a random well - sampled ptf light curve .    applying the standard microlensing - search prescription to the ptf data presents obvious challenges .",
    "for example , microlensing surveys have relatively uniform time sampling of their survey footprint over an observing season , justifying the first requirement .",
    "but it is harder to motivate such a cut on data with significant and irregular gaps . in order to develop the most successful procedure for ptf data , we therefore examine the relative performance of a set of variability indices and of the traditional prescription in selecting simulated microlensing events .     and",
    "@xmath33 , this corresponds to the light curve with the _ minimum _ value of the index over the entire field . for the other indices , these are the light curves with the _ maximum _ value of the relevant index over the field . these light curves illustrate the type of variability that each index is most sensitive to . ]",
    "we choose five statistical measures of variability compiled by @xcite that have been previously applied to the classification and discovery of periodic variables .",
    "these variability indices are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath33 . , because it mainly helps identify periodic sources . ]",
    "@xmath34 is the ratio of the sample standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) to the sample mean ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 where n is the total number of observations .",
    "we modify the definition of @xmath35 to be the number of clusters of three or more consecutive observations that are more than @xmath40 brighter than the reference magnitude of the source ( e.g. , for a single microlensing event in an otherwise flat light curve , @xmath41 ) .",
    "this change allows us to use the performance of @xmath35 as a proxy for the consecutive - point requirement described above .",
    "@xmath36 , the von neumann ratio ( also known as the durbin - watson statistic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is the mean square successive difference divided by the sample variance : @xmath42 @xmath36 is small when there is strong positive serial correlation between successive data points .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath33 were suggested by @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the photometric error of each data point , and the @xmath45 function returns @xmath461 , depending on the sign of the argument .",
    "@xmath37 tends to 0 for non - variable stars , but is large when there are significant differences between successive data points in a light curve .",
    "@xmath33 is a measure of the kurtosis of the distribution of data points .",
    "we add one more index , @xmath47 , the difference in @xmath48 between fitting a gaussian model and fitting a linear model to a light curve .",
    "this is a standard statistical test used by microlensing surveys , and allows us to compare the relative performance of the ( slightly modified ) @xcite indices and of this approach .",
    "specifically , we use a levenberg - marquardt optimizer to perform a least - squares fit with each of these models to the light curves and then compute @xmath49 . our tests with @xmath47 below",
    "compare the distribution of values over light curves on the same chip . as a result , the number of data points and number of model parameters are constant , and we therefore do not include an akaike or bayesian information criterion ( aic or bic ) term . for the gaussian fit ,",
    "the optimizer is initialized with a @xmath13 of 10 days , centered on the brightest data point .",
    "figure  [ fig : indices_examples ] shows maximally outlying light curves for each variability statistic selected from @xmath020,000 light curves for objects on a single ccd in ptf field 3756 . clearly , the indices are sensitive to different aspects of variability in the data .",
    "we expect @xmath34 to be most useful for discerning periodic or semi - periodic variability where the variance is large ; the expectations are not as clear for other indices .",
    "we conduct monte carlo simulations and inject artificial microlensing events into real ptf light curves .",
    "we then compare the distributions of variability indices for a set of light curves with and without these simulated events to determine the regions of parameter space where microlensed light curves fall .",
    "figure  [ fig : var_indices ] shows projections of the distribution for various combinations of the variability indices for another ptf field .",
    "these simulations do define regions to search for microlensing events , but there is still a large amount of overlap between the distributions with and without microlensing events .",
    "below we describe our method for defining selection boundaries for each variability statistic to determine which is most efficient for detecting microlensing events .",
    "we begin by randomly sampling 1000 light curves from each chip in a given ptf field",
    ". at least half of the individual observations in these light curves must be defined as `` good '' ( see description of processing pipeline in * ? ? ?",
    "the rejected light curves are for objects that are either faint or near bright stars whose scattered light and diffraction spikes cause large photometric errors .    for each of these light curves , we use the date and magnitude error information to simulate 100 light curves with purely gaussian scatter .",
    "we find the value of each variability index such that the selection using that index to identify interesting light curves returns 1% of these scrambled light curves  i.e. , we set the limiting value of each index such that the false positive recovery ( fpr ) rate is 1% per trial .",
    "we again randomly sample 1000 light curves from each ccd with @xmath410 good observations and compute the set of indices for these light curves .",
    "finally , we add 100 different simulated microlensing events to each light curve and evaluate how often these events are recovered given the 1% fpr cut defined above .",
    "the parameters for each simulated event are chosen as follows : @xmath21 is drawn from a uniform distribution between the first and last observation date , @xmath20 is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and @xmath01.5 ( the impact parameter that causes a maximum deviation larger than @xmath0@xmath50 for a @xmath51 mag source ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath22 is drawn from a log - uniform distribution between 1 and 1000 days .",
    "for each iteration we recompute the variability indices and store the event parameters .",
    "figures  [ fig : detection_efficiency_4327]-[fig : detection_efficiency_100152 ] show the results for three representative fields with different sampling patterns ( top panels ) and detection efficiency curves computed using this simulation ( bottom panels ) .",
    "we ignore the indices _ k _ and @xmath34 because their integrated detection efficiencies are below 1% . at a fixed fpr of 1%",
    ", @xmath35 performs poorly , but it may be useful as an initial cut if a higher fpr is used . in this work ,",
    "we only consider a single - index selection method and thus reject @xmath35 .",
    "for each of these fields we find that @xmath36 consistently performs better than the other indices at recovering microlensing events .",
    "this is especially interesting because computing @xmath36 is @xmath0100@xmath8 faster per light curve than computing @xmath52 .",
    "identifying candidate microlensing events in the full ptf dataset using this statistic is therefore computationally plausible .",
    "to identify candidate microlensing events we :    1 .   select the light curves from one of the 2097 fields with @xmath410 @xmath5-band observations ; 2",
    "identify those light curves with more than 50% good data points and @xmath410 good observations and run monte carlo simulations to compute the 1% fpr limiting values for @xmath36 , @xmath47 , and @xmath37 for that field ; 3 .",
