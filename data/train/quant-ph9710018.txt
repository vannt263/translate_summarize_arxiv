    ", we will give closed analytical expressions for the complex berry phase of an open quantum system in a resonant state of a hermitian hamiltonian with non - self - adjoint boundary conditions , and we will discuss some of its properties .    during the last fourteen years",
    "the geometric phase factors arising in the adiabatic evolution of quantum systems@xcite have been the subject of many investigations@xcite .",
    "the early literature was mostly concerned with the geometric phase factors of closed systems driven by hermitian hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "more recently there has been a substantial interest in the complex geometric phase acquired by the eigenstates of open quantum systems .",
    "this problem arises naturally in connection with various experiments which , by their very essence , require the observation of the geometric phase in metastable states .",
    "the berry phase in the optical supermode propagation in a free laser , which is a classical system described by a schrdinger - like equation with a non - hermitian hamiltonian , was studied by dattoli et al.@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the geometric phase in atomic systems with two energy levels , one of which at least is metastable , was also described in terms of a non - hermitian hamiltonian by miniatura et al.@xcite .",
    "the validity of the adiabatic approximation for dissipative , two level systems driven by non - hermitian hamiltonians was examined by nenciu and rasche@xcite , and by kvitsinsky and putterman@xcite , who also established that the berry phase is complex in this case .",
    "sun@xcite proposed a higher - order adiabatic approximation for two - level non - hermitian hamiltonians , and showed that the holonomy structure associated to the berry phase factor in this non - hermitian case is the non - unitary generalization of the holonomy structure of the hermitian case .",
    "in two previous papers@xcite , we gave explicit expressions for the geometric phase of true resonant states , defined as complex energy eigenstates of a hermitian hamiltonian which satisfy purely outgoing wave boundary conditions at infinity@xcite , and pointed out some of the mathematically interesting and physically relevant properties resulting from the extended nature of the singularities in parameter space associated with the occurrence of accidental degeneracies of two resonances .",
    "in this conection , in another paper we showed that the codimension of the accidental degeneracy of @xmath1 resonances differ significantly from those of bound states , we also showed that , close to a crossing of two resonant states , the topological structure of the energy hypercomplex surfaces differ significantly from the double conical point singularity typical of bound states@xcite . later , by means of a numerical analysis of the experimental data on the 2@xmath2 doublet of resonances with @xmath3 in the energy spectrum of @xmath4be , we showed , in a realistic example , that a true crossing of resonances mixed by a hermitian interaction may be brought about by the variation of only two real linearly independent parameters@xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the geometric interpretation of the berry phase factor , first given by b. simon@xcite for the adiabatic evolution of closed quantum systems , may be generalized , in a very natural way , to the case of resonant states of open quantum systems .",
    "that is , the adiabatic evolution of resonant states may be interpreted as parallel transport in a complex line bundle defined over the space of parameters with structure group @xmath5 ( the multiplicative group of the non - zero complex numbers ) .",
    "then , the berry phase factors of resonant states arise as the holonomy group elements due to a connection in the bundle such that during the adiabatic evolution the resonant state is parallel transported along the fibre .",
    "the horizontal spaces are perpendicular to the fibre with respect to a generalized inner product of resonant states defined in a rigged hilbert space .",
    "let us consider the time evolution of a quantum system in a state which is a superposition of unstable eigenstates moving in some strong external field of force which changes slowly with time .",
    "in order to have some concrete example in mind , although a very hypothetical one , we may think of an @xmath6 nucleus which has only unstable energy eigenstates moving in the field of forces of a double magic nucleus , like @xmath7 in a peripheral collision in which the distance between the two nuclei is never smaller than the sum of the nuclear radii . in a semiclassical treatment of the collision , when the centers of the nuclei move along classical trajectories , the parameters in the nucleus - nucleus interaction change with time@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the system under the influence of the external perturbation is governed by the time dependent schrdinger equation    @xmath8    the hamiltonian @xmath9 is the sum of the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath10 describing the evolution of the unperturbed system plus a perturbation term @xmath11 which is a function of a number @xmath12 of  external \" parameters @xmath13 which may change with time ,    @xmath14    the energy eigenfunctions of the unperturbed hamiltonian are the solutions of the equation ,    @xmath15    the wave functions @xmath16 satisfy the boundary conditions appropriate to a decaying state .",
    "assuming that , in the absence of perturbation , the unstable system decays spontaneously in two stable fragments , the unperturbed energy eigenfunctions may be written as cluster model wave functions@xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the wave functions of the clusters a and b , @xmath20 is the radial part of the wave function of the relative motion of the two clusters , @xmath21 is a spherical harmonic and @xmath22 is the antisymmetrizer . in our example , @xmath23 would be the eigenfunction of a state of @xmath4be which decays spontaneously in two @xmath24he clusters . in this case",
    "@xmath20 is a gamow function .",
    "gamow functions are the eigenfunctions of the time independent schrdinger equation which vanish at the origen , and behave as purely outgoing waves for large values of the relative distance @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    and    @xmath27 = 0,\\ ] ]    where the function @xmath28 is an outgoing spherical wave of complex wave number @xmath29 and angular momentum @xmath30@xcite .",

    "this generalization leads out of the hilbert space based quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , the quantum mechanical rules for normalization , orthogonality and completeness in their usual form , do not apply . nevertheless , bound and resonant states form a bi - orthonormal set with their adjoints , which may be extended by a continuum of suitably chosen scattering states of complex wave number to form a complete set in terms of which any square integrable function may be expanded @xcite .",
    "the symmetry properties of the schrdinger equation and the boundary conditions under the operations of complex conjugation and reversal of time suggest a definition for the adjoint @xmath35 of the gamow function @xmath36@xcite ,    @xmath37    now , if the adjoint @xmath35 is identified with the bra - eigenfunction , the quantum mechanical inner product , or bra - c - ket rule , may be generalized to include gamow eigenfunctions . with this prescription ,",
    "matrix elements of operators and inner products are computed in configuration space representation as integrals over the radial variable @xmath25 . since the gamow function @xmath36 and its adjoint @xmath35",
    "oscillate between envelopes that grow exponentially with @xmath25 , the integrals over @xmath25 must be properly defined .",
    "this may be done , either by analytic continuation in the complex @xmath38-plane from above @xcite or by means of an abel regulator@xcite with a suitable convergence factor and a limiting procedure@xcite .",
    "both procedures give the same result@xcite .",

    "finally , the square brackets around the integrals mean that , when necessary , the integrals are defined by means of a gaussian regulator and a limit as in ( [ ocho ] ) or by analytical continuation from above as in mondragn and hernndez@xcite .    since @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary functions , we are justified in writing the expansion    @xmath48    the index @xmath49 runs over bound and resonant states .",

    "we may , now , go back to our problem , namely the time evolution of the resonant states of a many body system moving in a slowly time - dependent external field of force .",
    "since we are interested in the time evolution of a state @xmath52 which is a superposition of unstable states , we make an expansion of the wave function @xmath53 in terms of bound and resonant states of @xmath54    @xmath55    in general , the index @xmath49 runs over bound and resonant states . in our example",

    "when the interactions are time reversal invariant , the dual of the complex gamow function @xmath20 is the same function@xcite .",

    "when the eigenvalues are equal , @xmath214 is either diagonal or equivalent to a jordan block of rank two .",
