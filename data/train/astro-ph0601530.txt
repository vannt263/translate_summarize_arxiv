    "the measurement of pulsar braking indices ( @xmath6 ) is crucial to the understanding of the physics underlying pulsar spin down , assumed to be of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pulse frequency , @xmath9 is the frequency derivative and @xmath10 , assumed to be constant , is related to the pulsar s magnetic field and moment of inertia . by taking a time derivative of the above spin - down equation , we find that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the second frequency derivative . it is typically assumed that pulsars radiate as perfect magnetic dipoles , implying @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption is used implicitly for the estimation of pulsar magnetic fields as well as to calculate characteristic ages ( defined as @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath13 ) . however , of the five unambiguous measurements of pulsar braking indices obtained so far , all yield a value of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "explanations for this discrepancy include the possibility that : the relativistic pulsar wind affects the spin - down @xcite ; the pulsar may suffer a propeller torque from a putative supernova fallback disk @xcite ; the pulsar has a time - varying magnetic moment @xcite ; or , the pulsar can not be modelled as a point dipole , rather , a dipole of some finite size which leads to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "there are few pulsars that are potential candidates for a significant measurement of @xmath6 ; 4 of the 5 measured values are from sources with characteristic ages under 2000yr .",
    "the first requirement for a significant measurement of @xmath6 is that the pulsar spins down sufficiently quickly for a measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "the second requirement is that the position of the pulsar is accurately known at the @xmath161 arcsecond level .",
    "the third requirement is that the spin - down must not be seriously affected by glitches , sudden spin - ups of the pulsar , or timing noise , a long - term , low - frequency stochastic wandering of the rotation about the overall trend .",
    "typically , glitches begin to seriously affect smooth spin down at characteristic ages of @xmath17kyr @xcite .",
    "thus many of the pulsars that may spin down fast enough for a measurement of @xmath6 are irretrievably contaminated by glitches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". timing noise varies from object to object , though is roughly correlated with spin - down rate ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and can prevent a measurement of @xmath6 in a finite data set in an unpredictable way .",
    "the very young , energetic pulsar psr  j1846@xmath00258  was discovered at the center of the supernova remnant kes 75 @xcite .",
    "neutral hydrogen absorption measurements indicate that the pulsar resides well across the galaxy , roughly at a distance of 19kpc @xcite .",
    "radiation from this pulsar is detected exclusively in the x - ray band , with a 0.5 - 10kev luminosity of @xmath18ergs@xmath3 for a distance of 19 kpc @xcite .",
    "if correct , the spin - down energy to x - ray conversion efficiency is 1.6% , 6 times greater than that found in the crab pulsar .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is typical of rotation - powered pulsars , with non - thermal power - law emission with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , its large inferred magnetic field of @xmath20 g and spectrum place it in an emerging class of rotation - powered pulsars with magnetar - strength fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a characteristic age of @xmath1yr , psr  j1846@xmath00258is",
    "likely the youngest of all known rotation - powered pulsars .    in this paper , we present the first phase - coherent timing solution for the kes 75 pulsar based on 5.5yr of x - ray timing data from a long - term monitoring campaign with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258  were made using the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ) on board _",
    "rxte_. the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the 2    60  kev range , with a total effective area of approximately @xmath21 and a field of view of @xmath22  fwhm .",
    "the data span 6.3yr from 1999 april 18 - 2005 july 27 and were collected in `` goodxenon '' mode , which records the arrival time ( with 1-@xmath23s resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of every unrejected event .",
    "typically , 3 pcus were operational during any observation .",
    "we used all layers of each operational pcu in the 260  kev range , as this maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio for this source .",
    "we analyzed 171 observations , resulting in 158 detections of the pulse for a total integration time of 337hr .",
    "the data were unevenly spaced throughout the 6.3yr of observations , as shown in figure  [ fig : distribution ] . because psr  j1846@xmath00258  was occasionally not the primary target of _ rxte _  in the observations",
    "we have used , integration times ranged from @xmath161.5 to @xmath2425ks , resulting in a variety of signal - to - noise ratios for individual pulse profiles .",
    "observations were downloaded from the heasarc archive and data from the different pcus were merged and binned at ( 1/1024)ms resolution using the ftools ` seextrct ' and ` fselect ' .",
    "photon arrival times were converted to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the j2000 source position ra = @xmath25 , dec @xmath26 @xcite and the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris with the fits tool ` faxbary ' .",
    "the remainder of the analysis was performed using software developed at mit for handling _",
    "we determined an initial ephemeris by merging adjacent short observations and performing a periodogram analysis that resulted in a set of 134 frequency measurements spanning the 6.3-yr monitoring interval . from these measurements",
    ", we derived an initial frequency derivative , @xmath9 .",
    "this ephemeris was used to fold each time series with 16 phase bins .",
    "this number of bins was chosen because of the lack of features in the roughly sinusoidal profile and the resulting reasonable signal - to - noise ratio for individual profiles , particularly those made from short integrations .",
    "resulting profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise ratio template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from all observations , shown in figure  [ profile ] .",
    "the cross - correlation process assumes that the pulse profile is stable ; indeed , we found no evidence for variability .",
    "we implemented a fourier domain filter by using only the first six harmonics in the cross - correlation . for each observation ,",
    "the cross - correlation yeilded the time of arrival ( toa ) of phase - zero of the average pulse profile at the fold epoch .",
    "the toas were fitted to a timing model ( see  [ sec : coherent ] and  [ sec : partial ] ) using the pulsar timing software package tempo .",
    "after phase - connecting the data ( see  [ sec : coherent ] ) , we merged observations occurring on a single day and used the ephemeris to re - fold the data in order to obtain more accurate toas .",
    "this process produced 81 toas with a typical uncertainty @xmath168ms ( @xmath162.5% of the pulse period ) , improved from a typical toa uncertainty of @xmath1610ms .      to obtain a phase - coherent timing solution , each turn of the pulsar is accounted for by fitting toas to a taylor expansion of pulse phase , @xmath27 . at time @xmath28 , @xmath27 can be expressed as : @xmath29 where the subscript 0 denotes a parameter evaluated at the reference epoch , @xmath30 .",
    "toas and initial parameters are input into tempo , which gives as output refined spin parameters and residuals .    to determine the spin parameters for psr  j1846@xmath00258 , we obtained phase - connected timing solutions for 5.5yr of x - ray timing data spanning 2000 january 31 to 2005 july 27 , and including 78 toas .",
    "the sampling of the observations over 6.3yr includes several large gaps and that precludes a single phase - coherent timing solution for the entire interval .",
    "the first _ rxte _",
    "observations of the pulsar ( which resulted in its discovery ) occurred @xmath169 months prior to the commencement of regular monitoring observations , and so were not useful in our phase - coherent analysis .",
    "the first coherent solution is valid over mjd 51574 - 52837 ( 3.5yr ) , while the second coherent solution is valid over mjd 52915 - 53578 ( 1.8yr ) , as indicated in figure  [ fig : distribution ] .",
    "we used our initial ephemeris ( described in the previous section ) to bootstrap a phase - coherent solution , valid over the 3.5yr interval from mjd 51574 - 52837 .",
    "this solution includes @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 , whose values are given in table 1 . in the process of phase connection , it became clear that a small glitch occurred at mjd 52210@xmath3110 .",
    "our measured glitch parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as determined with the glitch fitting facility in tempo .",
    "the relatively wide spacing of data near the glitch epoch prevent the detection of any glitch recovery .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the initial frequency jump was larger and recovered significantly before the following observation .",
    "timing residuals after subtraction of our best - fit timing model , including the glitch , are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ephem1 ] .",
    "note that systematic trends remaining in the residuals are likely the result of timing noise , common among young pulsars , though unmodelled glitch recovery may also contribute to the observed residuals .",
    "timing noise processes are known to contaminate measured spin parameters , hence it is typically advisable to remove the systematics from the residuals by fitting additional frequency derivatives until the residuals are consistent with gaussian noise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this pulsar",
    ", a total of eight frequency derivatives were required to obtain gaussian distributed residuals .",
    "timing residuals with all eight derivatives removed are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ephem1 ] .",
    "fitting additional frequency derivatives improves the @xmath34 from 2933 for 43 degrees of freedom to 77 for 37 degrees of freedom .",
    "this @xmath34 value indicates that the fit does not completely describe the data , however , this is not uncommon when fitting timing noise , which is often not well described by a polynomial .",
    "the braking index , resulting from this ` whitened ' timing solution , is @xmath35 .",
    "deterministic spin - down parameters ( i.e. not the higher order derivatives that represent timing noise ) as well as glitch parameters for this timing solution are given in table  [ table : ephem ] .",
    "phase was lost over a 78-day gap in the data beginning at mjd 52837 , made clear by the fact that a solution attempting to connect over this gap fails to predict the pulse frequency at previous epochs .",
    "this loss of phase could be due either to timing noise or another glitch .",
    "however , the estimated change in frequency over the gap , calculated from phase - coherent solutions on each side of the gap , is negative , ie . in the opposite direction from a conventional glitch .",
    "this implies that a glitch alone can not account for the loss in phase .",
    "a second phase - coherent solution was obtained for the 1.8-yr interval from mjd 52915 - 53579 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 fitted .",
    "the residuals after subtraction of the best - fit parameters are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ephem2 ] . as systematic trends , again interpreted as timing noise or possibly unmodelled glitch recovery , remained in the residuals ,",
    "three higher - order frequency derivatives were fitted .",
    "the resulting residuals are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ephem2 ] .",
    "the measured braking index resulting from the ` whitened ' timing solution is @xmath36 , in agreement with that measured from the first segment of timing data .",
    "deterministic parameters for the second timing solution are given in table  [ table : ephem ] .      in order to mitigate the effects of timing noise",
    ", we also performed a partially phase coherent analysis . in this way we obtained measurements of @xmath8 spanning 6.3yr of data as well as @xmath9 and @xmath12 over 5.5yr of data .",
    "this method is useful to detect small glitches , as well as to obtain more accurate measurements of @xmath6 in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the overall phase - coherent ephemeris as a starting point ,",
    "closely spaced observations were phase - connected to obtain a local measurement of @xmath8 . in this way we obtained a total of 22 measurements .",
    "a two degree polynomial was fitted to these measurements to get another measurement of @xmath6 , however , in this case , the glitch near mjd 52210 and the possible glitch between mjd 52837 - 52915 seriously restricted the available time baseline and rendered this analysis of limited value .",
    "the most constraining measurement is @xmath37 , from 13 values of @xmath8 spanning mjd 51286 - 52199 , in agreement with our phase - coherent value .",
    "we repeated this process , measuring eight independent values of @xmath9 , shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : nudot ] .",
    "note that the first unambiguous @xmath9 measurement occurred before the glitch near mjd 52210 and the glitch can clearly be seen in the figure .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nudot ] shows the post - glitch slope removed from the data , highlighting the change in @xmath9 at the time of the glitch , @xmath38 , in agreement with the value obtained from the phase - coherent fit .",
    "note that at the 78day data gap between mjd 52837 and 52915 , there is no clear @xmath39 visible in figure  [ fig : nudot ] .",
    "this indicates that if a glitch did occur during this period , it consisted of primarily a change in @xmath8 .",
    "the only glitch consistent with the data would have had to have occurred near mjd 52910 with magnitude @xmath40 .",
    "a glitch with no change in @xmath39 is typical of pulsars with larger characteristic ages ( @xmath41kyr ) , but can not be ruled out in this case .",
    "we also performed two linear weighted least square fits on the @xmath9 measurements , both before and after the gap at mjd 52837 - 52915 , to obtain measurements of @xmath12 and thus @xmath6 .",
    "the first segment resulted in @xmath42 , while the second resulted in @xmath43 , @xmath44 from each other .",
    "uncertainties were obtained from a bootstrap analysis , since we suspected that the formal uncertainty may underestimate the true uncertainty because of the presence of timing noise .",
    "the bootstrap is a robust method of determining errors when a small number of sample points is available , as in this case @xcite .",
    "the first measurement is @xmath45 from our phase - coherent average value of @xmath5 , while the second measurement is in agreement with it .",
    "finally , we obtained four independent measurements of @xmath12 by phase - connecting as much data as possible with just @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 , such that there was no noticeable contamination by timing noise appearing in the resulting residuals .",
    "the resulting @xmath6 measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : indices ] .",
    "note that there is some indication that @xmath6 is growing with time , at at rate of @xmath46yr@xmath3 , resulting in a change in @xmath6 of @xmath47% over 5.5yr . however , this effect is only significant at the @xmath48 level .",
    "a similar analysis of 21 yr of data of the young pulsar psr b1509@xmath058 showed long - term variations of @xmath161.5% in @xmath6 , though these were shown to fluctuate about an average value of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "further timing observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258  will show if its value of @xmath6 is changing secularly or is subject to timing noise variations as in psr b1509@xmath058 .",
    "in order to check the validity of our _ rxte _  analysis , we re - analyzed the timing signal in two archival observations of the pulsar obtained with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _",
    "( _ asca _ ) observatory @xcite .",
    "details of the first observation ( 1993 october ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite , while details of the second observation ( 1999 march ) are described in @xcite . using the prescription in the _ asca _  data reduction guide and standard fits tools",
    ", we extracted photons from the two gas - imaging spectrometers ( giss ) in the 3 - 8kev range from a @xmath49 radius aperture surrounding the source .",
    "we chose this energy range in order to preferentially select the harder energy photons which mainly come from the pulsar rather than the softer energy events having a high probability coming from the supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "we adjusted photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter and then performed a periodogram analysis on the event data centered on the pulse frequency predicted by our _ rxte _",
    "we folded the data with 10 phase bins and detected a weak pulse in each observation .",
    "we generated a @xmath34 periodogram in frequency space and identified the peak @xmath8 . to determine the uncertainty in the measured frequencies",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation that created fake data sets containing a periodic signal ( at the @xmath8 and amplitude determined from the periodogram ) and poisson noise .",
    "a periodogram was then performed on each noisy fake data set and the best @xmath8 was recorded .",
    "we performed 500 iterations for each observation and took the standard deviation as the @xmath50 uncertainty on our @xmath8 measurement . using this method",
    ", we determined that for the 1993 october observation , @xmath51hz and for the 1999 march observation , @xmath52hz .    to verify our _ rxte _  results , we compared the above _",
    "asca_-measured frequencies , as well as two 1999 _ bepposax _  timing observations reported on by @xcite , with the _ rxte _  ephemeris prediction . both _ bepposax _",
    "@xmath8 measurements agree with our ephemeris within uncertainties , as do the two _ asca _  frequencies . that the 1993 _ asca_measurement of @xmath8 agrees with our prediction",
    "is somewhat surprising , since the ephemeris used to predict the value covers dates beginning seven years later .",
    "this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of glitches having occured in the interim however , since glitches in other young pulsars have been measured that sometimes have amplitudes @xmath53 orders of magnitude smaller than we could detect given the uncertainties here @xcite .",
    "if no glitches occurred during the 6-yr gap from 1993 to 1999 , then it is possible to fit all frequency measurements prior to the mjd 52210 glitch with a second order polynomial in order to measure the braking index .",
    "performing this analysis , the resulting braking index is @xmath54 , 2.2@xmath55 from our phase - coherent result .",
    "establishing true ages of pulsars is important for several aspects of neutron - star studies , including neutron star cooling , population synthesis , spatial velocity estimates , and to consider their associations with supernova remnants .",
    "based on spin - down properties alone , the true pulsar age is impossible to determine . however , we can estimate the age based on the standard spin - down model ( @xmath56 ) given our measurement of @xmath6 . integrating this model yields , @xmath57 assuming that the initial spin frequency was much larger than the current value , @xmath58 ,",
    "the age estimate for psr  j1846@xmath00258  becomes , @xmath59 since the initial spin frequency is unknown , the above estimate provides an upper limit on the pulsar age .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath6 and @xmath10 have remained constant over the lifetime of the pulsar , the upper limit on the age of psr  j1846@xmath00258  is @xmath16884yr . this value is larger than the characteristic age of 723yr , but still smaller than the unambiguously known age of the next youngest pulsar , that in the crab nebula .",
    "@xcite did an analysis of frequency measurements of the _ asca _  and _ bepposax _  data , as well as a small subset of the _ rxte _  data reported here .",
    "although data gaps prevented them from a firm conclusion regarding @xmath6 because of the possibility of glitches , their tentative estimate ( made assuming no glitches nor substantial timing noise ) was @xmath60 , inconsistent with our result .",
    "there are two plausible explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "the first is that significant timing noise and/or glitches can not be definitely excluded in the 6-yr gap between the successive _ asca",
    "_  observations .",
    "the second is that the coordinate used to barycenter these data was ultimately found to be off by @xmath61 .",
    "the earlier study used coordinates derived from _ asca _  data with a @xmath62 position uncertainty , prior to the availability of the new measurement provided by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ used herein .",
    "our measured @xmath5 is significantly less than 3 , as is the case for all established values of @xmath6 , which are shown in table  [ table : indices ] .",
    "there are several ideas for the nature of the deviation from the prediction of simple magnetic dipole braking .",
    "a time - varying magnetic moment could produce an observed @xmath6 less than the true @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a varying _ b_-field can in principle be verified with a measurement of the third frequency derivative , @xmath64 , which may or may not ultimately be possible for this source , depending on the number and strength of the glitches it experiences , as well as on the strength of its timing noise .",
    "presently , @xmath64 has been measured for only two pulsars , both of which are consistent with a constant @xmath65 @xcite . another suggested explanation for @xmath15 is that a fallback disk forms from supernova material and modulates the spin - down of young pulsars via a propeller torque .",
    "spin - down via a combination of magnetic dipole radiation and propeller torque results in @xmath66 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this requires that the disk material does not suppress the pulsed emission during the propeller phase , which is difficult to achieve @xcite .",
    "angular momentum loss due to a stellar wind would result in @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "thus spin - down due to some combination of relativistic pulsar winds associated with young neutron stars and observed indirectly as pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and magnetic dipole spin down may result in measured values @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite presented an intriguing solution to the @xmath15 problem .",
    "he postulated that the radius pertinent to dipole radiation is not the physical neutron - star radius , but a `` vacuum radius '' , associated with the location closest to the neutron star where field - aligned flow breaks down .",
    "since this radius can be significantly larger than the neutron - star radius , the system can no longer be treated as a point dipole and @xmath13 is not necessarily true .",
    "his model provides a prediction for @xmath6 , given three observables : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath68 , the angle between the spin and magnetic axis .",
    "this model predicts that @xmath66 for all pulsars and that @xmath6 approaches 3 as a pulsar ages .",
    "currently , there is no measurement of @xmath68 for psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "however , for the model to be consistent with our measured @xmath6 within @xmath69 , @xmath68 must lie between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is small but not unreasonable given the very broad pulse profile for this source .",
    "future radio polarimetric observations could in principle constrain @xmath68 , though at present , no radio detection of this source has been reported @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath6 for psr  j1846@xmath00258  brings the total number of measured braking indices to six , shown in table  [ table : indices ] , along with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for each object . comparing this new value to the other four measurements obtained via typical timing methods ( i.e. excluding the vela pulsar whose @xmath6 was measured using a different method , due to the large glitches experienced by this pulsar )",
    ", we find no correlations between @xmath6 and any of the other parameters .",
    "if the vela pulsar is included in the analysis , there is a slight correlation between @xmath6 and characteristic age .",
    "however , there is a relatively large scatter among the five younger pulsars , suggesting the vela pulsar s value could also be just an extremum of the scatter",
    ".    the large scatter in the observed values of @xmath6 could be intrinsic to the pulsars , for instance , there may exist a relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath68 or @xmath65 , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "one way to test this possibility would be to obtain more precise measurements of @xmath68 for the youngest pulsars , e.g. via polarimetric observations .",
    "this , however , may prove difficult given that young radio pulsars tend to show very flat position angle swings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the scatter could be the result of a physical process outside the neutron star that is affecting pulsar spin down , such as a supernova fallback disk as suggested by @xcite .",
    "a supernova fallback disk was recently discovered by @xcite around a young neutron star , though there is no indication that the disk and the neutron star are interacting .",
    "psr  j1846@xmath00258  is in an emerging class of high magnetic field rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of these sources raises the question of why they appear to be rotation powered instead of powered by the decay of their large magnetic fields , as are the magnetars .",
    "the magnetar model proposed by @xcite provides a prediction for the x - ray luminosity of a neutron star with a magnetic field of @xmath76 g given a measurement of @xmath6 . in the model ,",
    "the neutron - star magnetosphere suffers a large scale ` twist ' of the north magnetic hemisphere with respect to the southern hemisphere , and resulting magnetospheric currents both scatter thermal surface photons and themselves heat the surface upon impact .",
    "both effects result in the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the model predicts a one - to - one relationship between twist angle and @xmath6 , as well as @xmath77 . in the case of psr  j1846@xmath00258 ,",
    "if the above model were applicable , the measurement of @xmath78 would imply a twist angle of @xmath79rad , which would predict an x - ray luminosity of @xmath80ergs@xmath3 .",
    "the observed luminosity of psr  j1846@xmath00258  in the 0.5 - 10kev energy range is @xmath18ergss@xmath3 for a distance of 19kpc @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with the magnetar model prediction .",
    "this suggests that the pulsar may actually be a magnetar .",
    "however , the estimated distance is is uncertain by a factor of two and likely overestimated , since the remnant flux and size are much larger than expected for the pulsar s age .",
    "thus the true x - ray luminosity of psr  j1846@xmath00258  could be significantly less than the magnetar model prediction , though this will likely remain uncertain . in any event , since the observed x - ray flux can be easily accounted for by the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , psr  j1846@xmath00258  is clearly not an ` anomalous ' x - ray pulsar .",
    "moreover , the pulsar s x - ray spectrum is much harder than that of any anomalous x - ray pulsar , and inconsistent with what is predicted in the magnetar model . indeed the spectrum is much more in line with those seen from rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "more theoretical work needs to be done to explain the difference between the magnetars and the rotation - powered pulsars having inferred magnetar - strength fields .",

    "<S> we present the first phase - coherent measurement of a braking index for the young , energetic rotation - powered pulsar psr  j1846@xmath00258 . </S>",
    "<S> this 324ms pulsar is located at the center of the supernova remnant kes 75 and has a characteristic age of @xmath1years , a spin - down energy of @xmath2ergs@xmath3 , and inferred magnetic field of @xmath4 g . </S>",
    "<S> two independent phase - coherent timing solutions are derived which together span 5.5yr of data obtained with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_. in addition , a partially phase - coherent timing analysis confirms the fully phase - coherent result . </S>",
    "<S> the measured value of the braking index , @xmath5 , is significantly less than 3 , the value expected from magnetic dipole radiation , implying another physical process must contribute to the pulsar s rotational evolution . assuming the braking index has been constant since birth , we place an upper limit on the spin - down age of psr  j1846@xmath00258  of 884yr , the smallest age estimate of any rotation - powered pulsar . </S>"
