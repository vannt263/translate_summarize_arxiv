    "an optical vortex soliton appears as a stationary self - trapped beam in a self - defocusing optical medium that carries a phase singularity on an electromagnetic field , so that the beam intensity vanishes at a certain point , and the field phase changes by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being integer ) along any closed loop around the zero - intensity point .",
    "if such an object is created in a linear bulk medium @xcite , it preserves the singularity but expands due to diffraction .",
    "however , in a nonlinear medium , the diffraction - induced expansion of the vortex core can be compensated for by a nonlinearity - induced change in the refractive index of a nonlinear medium , thereby creating a stationary self - trapped structure , _ an optical vortex soliton .",
    "_ such nonlinear localized waves carrying a singularity were first introduced as stationary solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the pioneering paper by ginzburg and pitaevsky @xcite to describe topological excitations in superfluids , but the same objects appear in many other fields @xcite including nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the parametric interactions may provide an efficient way of vortex transformation .",
    "in particular , by mixing waves of different frequencies , one can change the vortex topological charge @xmath1 and even the vortex polarization .",
    "recently , the first experimental results on the vortex generation in the presence of two - wave parametric mixing have been reported in nonlinear optics , including the second - harmonic generation ( shg ) @xcite and more general types of frequency conversion @xcite and sum - frequency mixing @xcite where the generation of higher - order ( @xmath2 linear vortices in the case of negligible spatial walk - off between harmonics was demonstrated .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no theory of parametric optical vortices in the presence of both diffraction and nonlinearity has been developed so far . in a nonlinear regime ,",
    "an interplay between diffraction and parametric coupling of the harmonic fields is expected to lead to the formation of stationary structures - _ parametric vortex solitons _ - supported by three- or four - wave mixing between the phase - matched waves of different frequencies .",
    "stability of such multi- frequency vortex solitons is a key issue .",
    "for example , in the problem of shg in a diffractive bulk medium , vortex solitons are expected to be unstable due to parametric modulational instability of the two - wave background field @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested @xcite that taking into account _ a weak defocusing cubic nonlinearity _ one can eliminate the development of parametric modulational instability allowing stable dark solitons to exist .",
    "some examples of stable two - wave parametric dark solitons have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it has been pointed out that , in the problem of shg , a stable vortex soliton of the lowest possible charge ( @xmath3 ) can exist describing a @xmath4-phase twist of the fundamental wave and @xmath5-phase twist in the second - harmonic field .    in the present paper",
    "we suggest a general approach to the analysis of _ multi - component vortex solitons _ resulting from parametric wave mixing .",
    "the general theory is then developed in detail in the no - walkoff case for _ two examples _ : ( i ) parametric interaction of the first and second harmonics in a medium with competing quadratic and cubic nonlinearity , and ( ii ) parametric interaction between the first and third harmonics in a medium with a cubic nonlinear response . in both the cases we find different classes of vortex solitons as ( 2 + 1)- dimensional dark solitons of circular symmetry carrying a phase singularity , and",
    "investigate their stability to propagation and modulational stability of the supporting two - component background waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly present two models of parametric wave interaction that describe a phase - matched coupling between the fundamental frequency mode and its harmonic field , in the case of phase - matched wave mixing and no walk - off .",
    "the further analysis of the asymptotic structure of stationary localized solutions for parametric vortex solitons is rather general , and it is presented in sec .",
    "iii for both the models .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of vortex solitons in the model of competing nonlinearities .",
    "we find numerically the profiles of two - component vortex solitons and investigate their stability to propagation . in particular , we reveal the existence of novel classes of dark - soliton solutions of radial symmetry , including _ a ring - vortex soliton _ , that consists of a vortex core in the harmonic field surrounded by a bright ring of its fundamental frequency , and _ a halo - vortex _ , a two - wave vortex soliton with nonmonotonic tails .",

    "we note that _ all these ring - vortex solitons are modulationally stable _ , because , in the framework of eqs .",
    "( [ thgnormal ] ) , modulational instability does not occur for one - component plane wave solutions .",
    "we have analyzed two - component vortex solitons supported by parametric wave mixing in a nonlinear optical medium .",
    "we have considered two classes of such vortex solitons . in the first case",
    ", we have studied the existence , structure , and stability of vortex solitons supported by phase - matched interaction between the fundamental and second - harmonic waves in a quadratic medium , and the effect of the next - order cubic nonlinearity has been taken into account for suppressing modulational instability of the supporting plane - wave background . in the second case ,",
    "we have considered how the vortex parameters , structure , and stability are modified due to the process of third - harmonic generation when the phase - matched wave interaction generates a corresponding multi - charge vortex component in a harmonic field . in particular , we have predicted the so - called ` halo - vortex ' consisting of a two - wave vortex core surrounded by a bright ring on a non - vanishing background .",
    "additionally , we have analyzed the waveguiding properties of a vortex soliton in the case when it guides a harmonic field due to a phase - matched parametric interaction .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the stability of these parametric vortex solitons is still an open problem , as well as the effect of walk - off on the vortex existence and stability .    as for experimental verifications of the vortex solitons described above",
    ", we would like to mention that , at least in the low - intensity regime , parametric vortices have already been observed in nonlinear optics . a possibility of shg by a beam with a vortex",
    "was first mentioned and experimentally verified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a vortex of the topological charge @xmath156 was found in the second - harmonic wave when the fundamental wave contained a vortex of the topological charge @xmath157 .",
    "the similar results on shg have been presented by dholakia _ et al _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas more complicated processes of sum - frequency mixing with beams carrying phase singularities were reported by beranskis _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that in all of those observations the different harmonics experienced noticeable walk - off that makes the stationary structures difficult to observe , also introducing novel features in the vortex dynamics .",
    "in particular , for a collinear type i phase - matched shg with an input beam carrying a single - charge vortex , matijoius _ et al _ @xcite observed two intensity zeroes in the second - harmonic field with the separation of two shg vortices due to walk - off .",
    "thus , we can expect that stationary two - component vortex solitons discussed above can be observed in typical upconversion experiments when a high - intensity beam undergoes frequency doubling simultaneously with the creation of a phase singularity produced by a phase mask at the input , similar to the experiments mentioned above which were performed at moderate powers .",
    "_ stability _ of those vortex solitons requires small ( or zero ) walk - off and a small defocusing kerr nonlinearity of an optical material at both ( or at least fundamental wave ) frequencies .",
    "additionally , we would like to mention that the parametrically coupled equations of competing nonlinearities , similar to eqs .",
    "( [ normalcomp ] ) analysed above , have been recently introduced by heinzen _",
    "et al _ @xcite to describe the dynamics of _ coupled atomic and molecular bose - einstein condensates _ , leading to a kind of `` super - chemistry '' in which the formation of molecules is a controlled parametric quantum process . in spite of the fact that both atomic and molecular condensates should be considered in a trapping external potential @xcite , many of the features of the coupled stationary states , including all the types of the vortex states introduced above ,",
    "are expected to exist in the model of atom - molecular condensates as well , providing a much broader view of the phenomenology of parametric vortex solitons .    at last",
    ", we expect that the concept of the two - component parametric vortices , generated and supported by the third - harmonic generation process , can be important in the so - called _ third - harmonic microscopy _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where an image is rendered using a series of cross - sectional images produced by third - harmonic generation within the specimen .",
    "vortices can then be formed due to the development of caustics @xcite in the reflected harmonic field , indicating the regions of highly concentrated inhomogeneities .",
    "this technique is based on the fact that the nonlinear susceptibility of solid media vary over many orders of magnitude , compared with linear refractive index changes that vary in a relatively small range .",
