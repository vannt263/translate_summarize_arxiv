    "the ability of the model to forecast the evolution of the atmosphere and the optical turbulence above the antarctic plateau has been extensively discussed in a previous paper by our team @xcite . in that paper",
    "all the 15 winter nights , for which measurements of the @xmath3 are available ( trinquet et al . 2008 ) above dome c , have been simulated with meso - nh .",
    "the main conclusion of @xcite was that meso - nh was able to reconstruct the optical turbulence in a region with extreme meteorological conditions such as dome c. however a mono - domain configuration with low resolution ( 100 km ) is not suitable to provide optical turbulence features well correlated to measurements while a grid - nesting configuration done with three domains ( horizontal resolutions of 25 km , 10 km and 1 km ) does it .",
    "more precisely , the mean simulated surface layer thickness @xmath4=48.9 m @xmath5 7.6 m was only 14 m higher than the observed one ( @xmath6= 35.3 m @xmath5 5.1 m ) .",
    "the median simulated free atmosphere seeing ( @xmath7=0.35 @xmath5 0.24 arcsec ) was very well correlated to the observed one ( @xmath8= 0.3 @xmath5 0.2 arcsec ) . however the model tended to overestimate the intensity of the optical turbulence in the surface layer , thus generating a too strong median total seeing ( @xmath9= 2.29 @xmath5 0.38 arcsec ) if compared to the observed one ( @xmath10=1.6 @xmath5 0.2 arcsec ) . this paper is intended to present the updated results for the same set of winter nights with an improved numerical configuration for the meso - nh model .",
    "[ fig_oro ]",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for a complete overview of the numerical configurations of the mesoscale simulations . here",
    "we briefly describe the differences in the numerical set - up with respect to the @xcite paper .",
    "a different digital elevation model ( dem ) , the so - called rampdemv2 ( radarsat antarctic mapping project digital elevation model , version 2 @xcite ) has been used instead of the gtopo30 dem from the u.s . geological survey used in @xcite .",
    "the improvement on the description of the orography is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_oro ] .",
    "the best description of the dome c area is obtained with rampdemv2 , and is especially visible at horizontal resolutions below 5 km . at @xmath0x=5 km ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oro]b , f , with gtopo30 and rampdemv2 orographic models , respectively ) , one can see that the concordia station ( labelled c on the figure ) is located on the local summit with rampdemv2 , and is not with gtopo30 .",
    "this is even more evident inside the innermost domain ( @xmath0x=1 km , fig .",
    "[ fig_oro]c , g ) .",
    "the surface scheme of meso - nh , the so called isba ( interaction soil biosphere atmosphere ) scheme , has been optimized for antarctic conditions : the thermal coefficient of the soil has been optimized for polar conditions and a climatological underground temperature t@xmath11 has been introduced @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize the main concepts of that study .",
    "our ability in well reconstructing the surface temperature t@xmath12 is related to the ability in well reconstructing the sensible heat flux h that is responsible for the buoyancy - driven turbulence in the surface layer .",
    "the meso - nh surface scheme is based on the force - restore method which consists in two equations that control the temporal evolution of the surface temperature t@xmath12 and the deep temperature t@xmath13 at a few tens of centimeters underground .",
    "the equation of the temporal evolution of the deep temperature has been modified adding a term depending on two free parameters : a climatological temperature t@xmath11 and a relaxation term called @xmath14 .",
    "the two equations previously mentioned were forced by a one - year set of measurements of solar direct and long - wavelength radiations , the temperature t , wind speed v , pressure p and specific humidity q of the air above the ground .",
    "the simulated t@xmath12 and t@xmath13 were compared to the observed one ( i.e. the temperature measured at -5 cm and -30 cm from the ground ) up to minimize the dispersion .",
    "this permitted to determine the two free parameters t@xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "such a study permitted us to optimize the surface scheme isba for applications of the meso - nh model to polar conditions .",
    "coming back to our study , both mono - domain ( low resolution ) and grid - nesting ( high resolution ) configurations have been employed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we could have restricted the study to the grid - nesting configuration ( with high horizontal resolution ) as it was the one giving the best results .",
    "however we decided to present also the results of the low horizontal resolution to confirm the previous conclusions of @xcite regarding the horizontal resolution necessary to be used for obtaining reliable forecasts .",
    "we focus our attention on the prediction of the 3d maps of @xmath15  obtained with the astro - meso - nh package implemented by our team in the meso - nh mesoscale model ( masciadri et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , ( 1999b ) ) and validated in successive phases above different astronomical sites ( among the most important masciadri & jabouille ( 2001 ) , masciadri et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , masciadri & egner ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "the model is employed here with the new configuration mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we especially look at three different features that mainly characterize the optical turbulence , already discussed in @xcite :    * the surface layer thickness ; * the median free atmosphere seeing ; * the median total seeing ( from the ground up to 10 km above ground level ) .    the study is performed for the same set of 15 winter nights used in @xcite and employing the same analysis .",
    "we first present the results of prediction of the surface layer thickness and then we present the forecasting of the free atmosphere seeing @xmath16 and the total seeing @xmath17 .",
    "the same method used in @xcite is employed to determine the surface layer thickness of each nights .",
    "we highlight that this is not the only way to define the surface layer but we are forced to use this method employed by @xcite to be able to compare simulations with measurements .",
    "the thickness @xmath18 is defined as the vertical slab containing 90% of the optical turbulence developed in the first kilometer : @xmath19 where @xmath15 is the refractive index structure parameter",
    ".    .surface layer thickness @xmath18 for 15 winter nights ( trinquet et al .",
    "the mean value is reported with the associated standard deviation ( @xmath20 ) and statistical error ( @xmath20/@xmath21 ) where n is the number of independent estimates that is independent nights .",

    "units are in arcsec.,title=\"fig:\",width=4 ]    [ fig : corr_see ]    table [ see ] reproduces the observed and simulated total seeing ( @xmath22 ) and free atmosphere seeing ( @xmath23 ) for each night .",
    "the median values with the respective standard deviation ( @xmath20 ) and statistical error ( @xmath20/@xmath21 ) are reported for the low and high resolution cases .",
    "one can see that the median total seeing calculated with the low resolution mode ( @xmath24 = 2.05 @xmath5 0.21 arcsec ) still remains larger than the observed one ( @xmath25 = 1.6 @xmath5 0.2 arcsec ) as it has been observed in @xcite .",
    "however the median forecasted seeing in the high resolution mode matches almost perfectly the observations ( @xmath26 = 1.7 @xmath5 0.21 arcsec ) .",
    "the same can be stated for the median free atmosphere seeing reconstructed by the model ( @xmath27 = 0.30 @xmath5 0.17 arsec ) that is very well correlated to the observed one ( @xmath28 = 0.30 @xmath5 0.20 arcsec ) .",
    "figure [ fig : corr_see ] shows the correlation plots for the total and free atmosphere seeing , for each of the 15 investigated winter nights .",
    "this figure confirms the good agreement between model and observation from a statistical point of view . how do the modifications implemented in the meso - nh model change the the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence ( @xmath15  profiles ) ?",
    "figure [ pv_cn2 ] shows the vertical profiles of the observed and simulated @xmath15  profiles obtained with the low and high resolution modes .",
    "we can observe that , similarly to what has been found in @xcite , near the ground the high resolution model provides a sharper decrease in the optical turbulence than the low resolution mode .",
    "however , with this new model configuration , the shape of the @xmath15  profile is better correlated to measurements in the first 60 m than with the previous configuration .",
    "we finally observe that , in both cases , there is still space for future improvements in some vertical slabs .",
    "we expressly avoid more complex calibration specific for a particular site as that presented in @xcite , because we intend to use the same model to discriminate the quality of other sites above the internal plateau .",

    "we conclude , that , in the present configuration , the meso - nh model with the astro - meso - nh package provides excellent estimates of the optical turbulence at dome c , from a qualitative as well as quantitative point of view , if used in the high resolution mode .",
    "all the conclusions achieved in @xcite remains unchanged .",
    "however we clearly put in evidence , in this paper , the positive impact of the new numerical configuration of the model meso - nh on the forecast of the optical turbulence , especially for the surface layer thickness and the total and free atmosphere seeing . in synthesis , the meso - nh model provides : a simulated mean surface layer thickness @xmath4 = 44.2 @xmath5 6.6 m versus the observed @xmath6 = 35.3 @xmath5 5.1 m. a simulated median total seeing @xmath26 = 1.7 @xmath5 0.21 arcsec versus the observed @xmath30 = 1.6 @xmath5 0.2 . a simulated median free atmosphere seeing @xmath27 = 0.30 @xmath5 0.17 arcsec versus the observed @xmath31 = 0.30 @xmath5 0.20 .",
