    "the qmc calculations are possible only for @xmath116 parallel to the anisotropy axis up to now .",
    "therefore , comparing with the powder measurements one has to consider that the magnetization step in the experimental data set is additionally broadened by the presence of the axial anisotropy @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the step gradient of the appropriate qmc calculation has to be sharper than the measurement performed on a powder sample .",

    "an unexpected result of the present study is the very large difference between the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction along the rungs ( @xmath4  =  43  k ) and legs ( @xmath133  @xmath134 2  k ) of the spin ladder .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood considering the different coordination and superexchange angles of the exchange mediating oxalate molecules .    on the rungs the oxalate forms a @xmath57 - 1,2,3,4 bridge between two ni ions .",
    "this bridge provides two symmetric superexchange pathways . on each path",
    "the ni 3d x@xmath61-y@xmath61 orbitals have an enhanced electron probability density extending directly towards the corresponding oxygen ions .",
    "there is a direct overlap of the ni 3d x@xmath61-y@xmath61 and the o 2p wave functions forming @xmath135 bonds .",
    "the polarized 2p orbitals themselves are strongly overlapping .",
    "therefore the intermediate carbon atom is not involved in the superexchange mechanism resulting in a strong antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction ( see fig . [ coordination ] ) . in the literature",
    "several @xmath57 - 1,2,3,4 oxalato - bridged ni(ii ) dimer and chain systems are reported ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) with @xmath4 values in the range of 20 to 42  k. the value of 43 k in snox is at the upper limit of the reported range .        for the oxalate bridge along the legs of the spin ladder",
    "the situation is completely different . in this case",
    "a @xmath57 - 1,2,3 oxalato bridge is formed . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ coordination ] only one ni ion forms two covalent bonds ( one with the x@xmath61-y@xmath61 orbital and one with the 3z@xmath61 - r@xmath61 orbital ) with the oxalate molecule whereas of the second ni ion only the 3z@xmath61 - r@xmath61 orbital forms one covalent bond .",
    "the o 2p orbitals involved in the ni - o bonds are not overlapping with each other and therefore either the carbon atoms or orthogonal o 2p orbitals are involved which strongly suppresses the strength of the superexchange mechanism and may even lead to a weak ferromagnetic exchange .",
    "similar @xmath57 - 1,2,3 oxalato bridges are reported for cu(ii ) systems with magnetic exchange strengths in the range of -0.2 to 0.3  k @xcite consistent with the estimate of @xmath133  @xmath134 2  k for snox .",
