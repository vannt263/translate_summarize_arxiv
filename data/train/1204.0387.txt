    "the bulk of low - momentum particles produced in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at the large hadronic collider ( lhc ) appears to emerge from a common flow field that is largely driven by the density gradients produced in the earliest stage of the collision  @xcite .",
    "this fluid dynamic paradigm of heavy ion collisions is supported by a large set of data from the lhc  @xcite and rhic  @xcite which includes the dependence of particle production on the azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane and its dependence on transverse momentum , pseudorapidity @xmath0 , particle species and centrality ( impact parameter ) of the collision .",
    "complementary support comes from recent indications that also event - by - event fluctuations of the energy density distribution produced in the earliest stage of a heavy ion collision , are propagated fluid dynamically .",
    "in particular , the measurement of non - vanishing odd harmonic coefficients , @xmath1 , in the azimuthal dependence of particle distributions is an unambiguous signal for the presence of sizable fluctuations in the initial stage of a heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "these findings point to a remarkable set of commonalities between the physics of the `` big bang '' determining the evolution of the universe , and the physics of the `` little bangs '' formed in heavy ion collisions , that creates hot and dense matter under conditions akin to those prevailing in the early universe around the first microsecond , where the transition from the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) to a confined hadron gas ( hg ) occurred .    in both cases ,",
    "the physical system is viewed at an initial time as exhibiting a phase space distribution with a high degree of symmetry , overlaid with distributions of localized fluctuations . in both cases ,",
    "these initial fluctuations are propagated fluid dynamically and are experimentally accessible , in the first case as fluctuations of the ( photon ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite and , in the second case , as fluctuations and characteristic variations in the density of particles produced in very energetic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "also , in both cases , the decoupling of the different particle species from the common fluid dynamical system provides important possibilities for experimental verification of the collective dynamics . in the case of big bang physics",
    ", it sets the time scale for the decoupling of photons and determines the primordial abundances of light nuclei . in the case of heavy ion physics ,",
    "it sets , i.a .",
    ", the hierarchy of temperatures for chemical and kinematic freeze - out , and determines the relative abundances of hadronic resonances .",
    "furthermore , the study of fluctuations is motivated mainly by the idea that details of the fluid dynamical evolution of a system make it possible to constrain its material properties . in the case of big bang physics ,",
    "this has allowed to constrain the composition of the universe in terms of visible matter , dark matter and dark energy  @xcite . in the case of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "this has allowed to establish that the produced matter exhibits the properties of an almost perfect fluid with a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio that is close to minimal  @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether these qualitative analogies between the physics of the early universe and the physics of heavy ion collisions can provide conceptual or technical advances in either field .",
    "can heavy ion physics learn from the techniques developed to analyze big bang physics , or vice versa , can it contribute to advances in modern cosmology ?",
    "synergies between both fields may arise on different levels .",
    "for instance , cosmology has studied in significant detail the question of how fluid dynamic perturbations are propagated in an expanding system , and there is at least some understanding of how non - linearities and turbulent phenomena relevant for structure formation build up , and which experimental measures may give access to them . in the context of heavy ion collisions , first analyses of the propagation of fluid dynamic perturbations have been undertaken with analytical and numerical techniques  @xcite , but these are arguably at the very beginning , and further explorations in close analogy to developments in cosmology may be beneficial .",
    "similarities between the big bang and the little bangs may also lead to synergies on the level of the techniques for the analysis of data on fluctuations .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to initiate such an effort . to this end",
    ", we shall use here a standard tool @xcite for analyzing the cmb anisotropy , and apply it to the study of sets of simulated particle densities from ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we note that studies of the physical system produced in the big bang and the systems produced in heavy ion collisions share not only remarkable commonalities but have also significant differences . for an analysis of fluctuations and their separation from other sources of signals , some of the obvious differences ( such as the vastly different scales involved in both problems , the different fundamental forces that govern the dynamics , and the difference in formulating the dynamics in general relativity or special relativity ) may be less important . potentially relevant , however , is the difference between a study of one big event ( even if consisting of a large but finite sample of statistically independent patches ) and the study of an - in principle arbitrarily abundant - sample of mesoscopic events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the spherical harmonic approach that underlies cmb data analysis . in sections 3 and 4 , we present and",
    "discuss an application of this approach to simulated heavy ion data , and in section 5 we apply the method to the particular case of elliptic flow , a standard measurement in heavy ion collisions . in section 6",
    "we summarize our findings and we present a brief outlook . finally , in appendix a we have presented mathematical details of the method and generalization of the model with constant flow amplitude to more complex one , when the amplitude of the flow depends on pseudorapidity .",
    "in cosmology , the cmb anisotropy is analyzed by means of two - dimensional maps that essentially cover the full sky ( like those from the cobe , wmap and planck experiments @xcite ) , or only patches of the sky ( boomerang , maxima , cbi , act etc.@xcite ) .",
    "analysis of such maps reveal the small temperature fluctuations and anisotropies that the early universe has left on top of an otherwise smooth and constant background . by expressing the measured signal in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics , useful quantities such as the power spectrum",
    ", alignment between different multipoles , statistical anisotropy and gaussianity of the cmb can be constructed and compared with theory even from a single map ( realization ) of the cmb sky @xcite . in the analysis of cmb data , the methods focus on the separation of the different components of the observed signal from that of the primordial cmb .",
    "the by - product of this separation yields additional maps for different kinds of foreground effects ( e.g. synchrotron , free - free and dust emission ) and the point - sources catalog @xcite .",
    "the analysis of heavy ion data from nuclear collisions at the lhc and the rhic faces similar challenges . on one hand ,",
    "several independent statistical methods are in use  @xcite to analyze two- and multi - particle correlations in terms of flow coefficient @xmath1 , taken to be sensitive to the fluid dynamical properties of the high density partonic system in its early stages of expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the same particle correlations are known to be sensitive to other important dynamical features of heavy ion collisions , such as jets or resonance decays .",
    "typical tasks in heavy ion collisions are then to either clean the flow signal as far as possible from confounding dynamical features , or to analyze a different class of interesting physical phenomena ( such as the point - sources produced by jets ) without biasing its analysis by underlying collective effects .",
    "the question arises , what one could learn for this class of problems if the investigation of morphological features commonly done in the cmb data analysis was applied directly to heavy ion collisions ?    each heavy ion collision results in a distribution @xmath2 of particles as a function of azimuthal angle @xmath3 and pseudorapidity @xmath0 .",
    "pseudorapidity is related to the polar angle @xmath4 of the produced particle with respect to the beam direction via @xmath5 , and @xmath3 characterizes the angle in the transverse plane orthogonal to the beam .",
    "we simulate such distributions with hijing @xcite ( heavy - ion jet interaction generator ) , which is an event generator that reproduces a number of main features of heavy ion physics in the energy range of rhic and lhc .",
    "it is build on pythia @xcite routines for hard interactions and jetset @xcite routines for string fragmentation . the initial geometry and matter distribution",
    "is determined via a glauber model @xcite .",
    "various phenomenologically relevant nuclear effects are also implemented , including e.g. the nuclear modification of parton distribution functions , or parametrization of the expected parton energy loss .",
    "however , hijing does not directly model a collective dynamics resulting in flow .",
    "as this is relevant for our study , we include flow effects a posteriori by modulating the azimuthal distribution of particles from hijing .    ) .",

    "[ fig_dndeta ] shows results for a semi - peripheral pb - pb collision at the lhc with a total of 12316 particles produced over more than 16 units of pseudo - rapidity .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity distribution of this randomly chosen simulated single event shows visible but relatively small fluctuations around a smooth event - averaged distribution . in preparation of the following analysis",
    ", we have replotted this distribution as a function of the polar angle @xmath4 .",
    "we see that the @xmath4-distribution is approximately flat over an extended range @xmath7 which corresponds to a sizeable window around mid - rapidity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a presentation in the variable @xmath4 thus highlights the region of approximately one unit around mid - rapidity for which most differential data are available .",
    "as remarked already , hijing does not generate realistic flow signals .",
    "for our study , we superimpose such flow signals a posteriori on hijing events by redistributing the generated particles such that event - averaged ensembles of collisions show a second order harmonic oscillation of the azimuthal angle @xmath3 with some prescribed magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure results in events that carry azimuthal oscillations supplemented by event - by - event fluctuations . fig .",

    "we then asked how pertinent features of heavy ion collisions , including collective flow and small - scale fluctuations manifest themselves visually in such a representation , and how they are characterized by standard cmb tools .",
    "a cmb - like analysis of fluctuations is based on an expansion in terms of spherical harmonics and thus returns the two - parameter set of coefficients @xmath75 . for the characterization of collective flow phenomena , that show up as purely azimuthal dependencies",
    ", the azimuthal harmonics with flow amplitudes @xmath1 provide a complete set of functions .",
    "therefore , the larger set of coefficients @xmath75 must arguably contain redundancies for the characterization of collective flow in heavy ion collisions . however , event - wise fluctuations in heavy ion collisions are not confined to the azimuthal @xmath3-direction and may be expected to show locally no preferred orientation in the @xmath0-@xmath3-plane .",
    "our study indicates that the larger set @xmath75 , while showing redundancies for the characterization of @xmath3-dependent phenomena , may offer novel opportunities towards characterizing small - scale fluctuations in heavy ion collisions and separating them from flow effects .",
    "for instance , we observed that due to the @xmath157 reflection symmetry of event - averaged identical nucleus - nucleus collisions , expansion coefficients with even integers @xmath47 are inevitably dominated by event - wise fluctuations .",
    "the set of these coefficients may then be used as a baseline on top of which collective or global event properties can be established .",
    "we have discussed all possible generalizations of the method in appendix a , focusing on @xmath4-dependency of the amplitude of the flow .this baseline allowed , for instance , to check in fig .",
    "[ fig_powerspec_background_map ] to what extent removal of the @xmath22 mode subtracts efficiently the effects of a rapidity - dependent multiplicity distribution from a fluctuation analysis .",
    "and we have seen in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig_powerspec_v2 ] how the larger set of coefficients @xmath75 can help visually and statistically to identify flow on top of a fluctuating background .    for the detection of flow - like azimuthal modulations , the method used here",
    "is limited by the level of statistical noise @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the multiplicity .",
    "thus , for @xmath160 the corresponding multiplicity required is in order of @xmath161 particles , which is close to the parameters at the lhc .",
    "this is parametrically the same dependence as e.g. in a flow analysis in terms of second order cumulants .",
    "higher order cumulant expansions can improve this statistical limit . in this sense",
    ", the cmb - like analysis of heavy ion collisions shown here provides an alternative for characterizing collective flow but does not offer obvious parametric advantages .",
    "however , it offers arguably a very well - suited setting for analyzing those event - wise fluctuations that remain once the dominant azimuthal modulations have been removed . in analogy to the questions asked in cosmology , one can then characterize what sets the scale of these remaining fluctuations .",
    "for instance , which physics underlies the fluctuations seen in a mollweide projection of heavy ion collisions after removal of flow harmonics , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_mollweide_map ] .",
    "how are these fluctuations sensitive to resonance decays , jet - like particle correlations or jets ? on which scales could critical phenomena leave characteristic signatures ?",
    "which similarities or characteristic differences could be expected for the corresponding maps based on fluctuations in the distribution of electric charge , or strangeness content ?",
    "we intend to follow up these and further questions in the analysis of real data , as well as in further model studies .",
    "some of these questions are well known in cmb science , when we can use , for instance , optimal filter approach to amplify the point - like sources , incorporated into diffuse background .",
