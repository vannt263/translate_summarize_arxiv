    "a _ parrondo game _ is a combination of two or more simple losing games in which possibly biased coins are flipped , a strategy for alternation between the simple games , and a state .",
    "the state determines the probabilities of winning in one or more of the simple games and codes the game history , including the capital of one or more players of the parrondo game .",
    "a winning strategy yields a positive expected value of the parrondo game , in spite of the constituent simple games having negative expected value : the so - called parrondo effect ( often referred to as parrondo s paradox  @xcite ) .",
    "conditions for the simple games and for the strategies ( and implicitly also for the parrondo game states ) were given by harmer and abbott  @xcite .",
    "we give new analytical expressions for results previously approximated by either computer simulations or discrete time markov chain analyses  @xcite .",
    "the original parrondo game rules  @xcite combined two games , of which the second was later modified to present new games where all the rules depend only on the history of the game and not on the capital  @xcite .",
    "we begin by analyzing this modified game , named @xmath0 .",
    "we perform the simple calculations reproducing the known result  @xcite that the ergodic expected value of @xmath0 is negative , in order to introduce the notation used in subsequent sections . in section 3",
    ", it is shown that it is possible to obtain a winning game by adjusting the state transition probabilities in the game in which @xmath0 is mixed with the original parrondo game @xmath1 .",
    "we then calculate the optimal strategy for the mixed game .",
    "finally , we analyze the original parrondo game in an analysis that requires the introduction of a new state parameter : the capital of the player .",
    "the set of possible outcomes of game @xmath0 is @xmath2 , also called _ losing _ and _ winning_. the game history @xmath3 is the outcome of game @xmath0 at time @xmath4 .",
    "the probabilities of the outcomes depend on the game history in the following way@xmath5 where we use the notation @xmath6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the time - dependent distribution , @xmath7 for the ergodic distribution where @xmath8 @xmath9 for example , the probability of winning after having lost two simple games is @xmath10 .    for the ergodic process , it holds that@xmath11 the linear system ( [ eq : args ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , has the following solution ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with the rightmost column indicating the value for @xmath12 = 0.001 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the ergodic expected value of the game is :    @xmath15    thus , the game has negative expected value for @xmath16 .",
    "mixed with another game , @xmath0 can have a higher expected value because the outcome probabilities @xmath17 of the mixed game depend on the parrondo game history @xmath18 rather than the simple game history @xmath19 .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) shows that if @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then @xmath23 , since @xmath24 and @xmath25 both have positive coefficients .",
    "the original biased coin - flipping game @xmath1 has outcome @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 , and outcome @xmath28 otherwise ( see  @xcite ) , thus its expected value is @xmath29 .",
    "it was in  @xcite mixed with @xmath0 , leading to an interest in the _ mixing parameter _",
    ", here denoted by @xmath30 . in the original game set - up , @xmath31 is the probability that @xmath18 is the outcome of game @xmath1 , otherwise it is the outcome of @xmath0 .",
    "the mixed game has positive expected value , i.e. @xmath32 for some @xmath16 .",
    "the fact the simple game @xmath0 in this mixed game also has positive expected value goes unremarked in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the negatively biased coin - flipping original game increases the probability @xmath33 for two consecutive losses in the mixed game , which in turn increases the expected value of the game @xmath0 enough to compensate for the loss suffered from the other simple game . for the mixed game @xmath34 it holds that @xmath35 @xmath36 since @xmath34 depends on both of the simple games . the linear system eq .",
    "( [ eq : args ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) has for @xmath31 the solution ( with the rightmost column indicating the value for @xmath12 = 0.001 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this results in a positive expected value of the parrondo game , now parametrised with respect to @xmath30 as well as to @xmath12 : @xmath39 the positive expected value is simply and intuitively due to changing the weights @xmath40 in the weighted sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , which shows the tacit dependence between the simple games .",
    "harmer and abbott  @xcite have experimentally studied a parameter for the probability of playing the simple games in a parrondo game , in order to maximize the capital of the player .",
    "the optimal state - independent strategy @xmath41 is found by maximizing @xmath42 over @xmath43 $ ] . for @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( see figures 1 through 3 ) . in a similar manner , the optimal state - dependent strategies can be calculated by defining @xmath42 as a function of the conditional probabilities @xmath46 .",
    "in parrondo s original game ( see  @xcite ) , the positive game outcome again depends on the tacit game interaction with a state parameter , in this case the accumulated capital .",
    "it mixes two simple losing games with equal probability , hence @xmath31 in our notation .",
    "the game outcome at time @xmath4 is @xmath47 .",
    "the winning probabilities in one of the games depend on the accumulated capital @xmath48 .",
    "the conditional transition probabilities are given by @xmath49    @xmath50    where we use the notation@xmath51\\ ] ] and skip the @xmath4 for the ergodic transition probabilites , and denote conditional probability @xmath52 .",
    "hence , @xmath53 is the probability of winning when the capital @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 we observe that    @xmath56    and since@xmath57 we can solve for the unknown @xmath58 in the linear system ( [ eq : gametree ] ) , ( [ eq : values ] ) , ( [ eq : modprob ] ) , and ( [ eq : bayes ] ) which for @xmath44 has the solution@xmath59 the unconditional probability of winning is@xmath60 and hence , from ( [ eq : gametree ] ) , ( [ eq : values ] ) , ( [ eq : sol ] ) , and ( [ eq : winprob ] ) , the probability of winning is @xmath61 and therefore @xmath62",
    "our analysis of parrondo games sheds light on the phenomenon known as the parrondo effect , or parrondo s paradox .",
    "we have shown in a simple way the interplay between the parrondo game constituents .",
    "while the expected values of the games had already been analyzed , the crucial observation is that all parrondo games are state - dependent , and thus when mixing parrondo games one game may alter the game state of another game .",
    "finally , we have provided the optimal value for the mixing parameter in mixed parrondo games .",
