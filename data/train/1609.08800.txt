    "@xcite , we assume for nanoparticles with dimensions in the range of tens of nanometers that the curvature of the metallic nanoparticles is small in comparison to the gap distance , such that we can approximately model tunneling in the gap region by considering planar metal slabs with varying gap separations @xmath1 , as shown in fig",

    "the total tunnel current is then obtained by integrating over the plane in the middle of the gap and parallel to the slab surface , @xmath33 , where from now on we will only consider electric fields and currents oriented along the direction @xmath34 perpendicular to the slab surface .",

    "we assume zero temperature throughout . quite generally , the non radiative decay of plasmons inevitably generates heat similar to the cases of nanoparticles  @xcite and thin films  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a sub - nm gap it might be expected that thermal effects cause some fluctuation in gap size and , depending upon the sensitivity of the tunnel current with the gap distance , introduce additional noise .",

    "in the following we submit eq .   to a corrected jellium - type model representative for sodium , with a wigner seitz radius @xmath40 and an additional confinement potential of @xmath41 ev chosen to yield the correct work function  @xcite .",
    "our approach closely follows related work of refs .  @xcite . in our dft simulations",
    "we first employ the local density approximation ( lda ) and compute the ground state properties self consistently using the exchange correlation potential of ref .",
    "the self consistent lda density is used as an input for wda , and we solve the kohn - sham equations for the wda exchange - correlation potential only once .",
    "this approach is similar to the g@xmath42w@xmath42 approximation  @xcite or the wkb approach of refs .",
    "@xcite using a suitable image charge potential  @xcite .    for the tunneling simulations we consider two jellium slabs , as depicted in fig .",

    "a technical detail that might be beneficial for realistic dft simulations beyond the jellium model is that our initial hamiltonian only depends on the vector potential @xmath17 , whose spatial variation can be neglected for optical wavelengths .",

    "as can be seen , in the gap region the wda results ( solid line ) coincide perfectly well with the classical image charge potential  @xcite ( circles ) , whereas inside the jellium the lda and wda results are in very good agreement .",
    "the small deviations can be attributed to the slightly different exchange correlation potentials of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used in our implementations .    for two uncoupled slabs the kohn - sham energies are double degenerate , one eigenvalue corresponding to the left and the other one to the right slab .",
    "when the two slabs become coupled through tunneling , the eigenstates split into the usual bonding and antibonding states with an energy difference given by the tunnel coupling .",
    "2(b ) shows the energy splitting for a slab thickness of 20 nm and for four selected gap distances . for energies @xmath50 around the fermi level , the splitting as a function of energy shows an exponential behavior characteristic for tunnel coupling .",
    "as the slab wavefunction scales with the slab thickness @xmath51 approximately as @xmath52 , the splitting is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "2(b ) show simulation results for a slab thickness of 10 nm where the energy splitting is reduced by a factor of two , which are in good agreement with the results for the thicker slab .",
    "this demonstrates that the thickness of the simulated slabs is sufficient and quantum confinement effects do not play an important role .",
    "we emphasize that each kohn - sham energy @xmath50 comes along with a subband of @xmath45 states , associated with the electron motion parallel to the jellium surface , which is filled up to the fermi energy .",

    "the square symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) show wda results obtained with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) periodic boundary conditions which are almost indistinguishable . for small gap distances",
    "all approaches give a very similar decay characteristics , whereas for larger distances , say beyond @xmath61 nm , our dft simulations show a significantly slower decay than the predictions of eq .",
    ", a finding in agreement with the tddft results . before pondering on the reasons for this bi - exponential decay , in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the conductivity as a function of photon energy for a variety of gap distances @xmath1 .",
    "one observes a strong frequency dependence of @xmath0 , in particular around @xmath61 nm , in contrast to eq .   which predicts for larger gap distances a flat and almost frequency - independent functional dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "from the comparison of the wda and lda results we observe a relatively small image charge effect , a finding in contrast to the conclusions of refs .  @xcite .     and for an external excitation that starts at time zero .",
    "the currents in the gap regions are magnified for clarity by a factor of 20 .",

    "4 we show the ( a ) paramagnetic and ( b ) diamagnetic current distribution for an optical excitation with @xmath63 ev [ see arrow in fig .  3(b ) ] which is turned on at time zero .",
    "first , the diamagnetic current contribution of panel ( b ) is proportional to the density @xmath49 and is phase delayed by 90@xmath64 with respect to the driving electric field , as can be directly inferred from the second term in eq .  .",
    "in contrast , the paramagnetic current shown in panel ( a ) accounts for the creation of current at different positions @xmath65 which then flows to position @xmath34 , as described by the first term in eq .  . owing to the @xmath66 light - matter coupling ,",
    "the highest current contributions originate from regions where the slope of the wavefunction is large , i.e. , at the jellium edges , as can be clearly seen in the figure . in a consecutive step ,",
    "current flows to different locations where it arrives with some phase delay due to the finite electron velocity .",
    "this is seen most clearly in the gap region , where the current magnitude has been enlarged by a factor of 20 for clarity .",
    "we are now in the position to understand the strong frequency and gap distance dependence of @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the ( c ) amplitude and ( d ) phase of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic current contributions . because we neglect damping effects in the diamagnetic term of eq .  ,",
    "an approximation certainly justified for photon energies",
    "larger than @xmath11 [ see eq .   and discussion below ] , the phase is 90@xmath64 throughout .",
    "in contrast , due to the charge transport of the paramagnetic term the corresponding current distribution acquires a phase that increases with increasing gap distance ( recall that current is predominantly created at the jellium edges ) .",
    "when the paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions are out of phase , which happens at a gap distance of approximately 0.5 nm , there is an ideal compensation of these two contributions and @xmath0 exhibits a minimum .",
    "also the bi - exponential decay shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) can be interpreted as a transition from dominant diamagnetic current at small gap distances to paramagnetic current at large gap distances .    in fig .",
    "5 we use the tunnel conductivity of eq .   to compute the optical spectra for two coupled sodium nanospheres , using the quantum corrected model  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath2 values of eqs .   and are fairly different , the trends in the computed spectra are similar , showing with decreasing gap distance the emergence of a ctp ( gradually appearing at the lowest photon energies and the smallest gap distances ) and the blue shift and damping of the bonding plasmonic resonances .",
    "this is finding is in accordance to refs .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that @xmath0 mainly triggeres the emergence of the ctp : below a critical value the ctp peak is absent , above the critical value the peak appears but its spectral position and shape is not substantially influenced by the precise magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "the above results finally allow us to critically examine the validity of eq .  . for small gap distances both the qcm of esteban et al .  @xcite and the dft results reproduce the bulk conductivity",
    "we have refrained from introducing a drude damping for the diamagnetic term in eq .  , which becomes important in particular for small frequencies , as we expect that such damping should become modified for larger gap distances where the electron density @xmath49 decreases .",
    "for this reason , all our results are only shown for photon energies above 0.5 ev where our damping neglect is certainly justified . with increasing gap distance ,",
    "the qcm and dft conductivities differ in various ways .",
    "first , the interplay of paramagnetic and diamagnetic currents can lead to interference effects which are absent in the qcm .",
    "in addition , for larger photon energies electron tunneling can occur through excited states [ see paramagnetic term in eq .  ]",
    "which are more strongly tunnel coupled [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , a feature not included in the qcm expression of eq .  .",
    "however , even without referring to dft simulations there are features in the interpolating expression of eq .",
    "that call for an improvement . for large gap distances",
    "the conductivity decays as @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the jellium density : while the exponential dependence of a tunnel process is properly reproduced , the amplitude depends on the damping rate @xmath11 of the bulk material , a finding in marked contrast to stm theory which predicts a conductivity dominated by the tunnel coupling strength . additionally , for finite frequencies and small gap distances where the inequality @xmath69 holds , eq .",
    "predicts an almost gap - distance independent conductivity , contrary to eq .   where the diamagnetic term ( which governs @xmath0 for small distances ) decays exponentially due to the vanishing density @xmath49 in the gap region .",
    "all these findings indicate that the expression of eq .   can at best serve as an approximate interpolation function .    in the present work we have investigated sodium which can be modeled reasonably well with the jellium model  @xcite . for transition metals , such as gold or silver , which are of more importance to the field of plasmonics , one must additionally consider @xmath15-band contributions , as discussed for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite . because of the larger work functions of gold and silver the gap distances where tunneling plays a role are significantly smaller than for sodium  @xcite .",
    "whether the interplay of dia and paramagnetic currents , as discussed in this paper , is then still of importance remains to be investigated .",
    "another open issue that should be addressed in the future is whether there exist quantities besides the optical cross sections that are more strongly influenced by @xmath0 .",
    "as mentioned before , the gap conductivity mainly acts as a trigger for the appearence of the ctp peak  @xcite , however , the precise @xmath0 value is of only minor importance",
    ". other quantities , such as the amount of charge transferred across the gap , could be influenced more strongly by @xmath0 . beyond the linear response regime",
    "discussed here , nonlinear optical processes , such as higher - harmonic generation , are known to depend sensitively on the details of tunneling  @xcite and it might be interesting to extend our approach to this non - linear regime .",
