    "it is quite common in geophysical fluid dynamics to encounter problems that involve the presence of both advection and dispersion ( see for example , chapter 5 in the text by majda @xcite and chapter 5 in the text by chemin et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) context ,",
    "simple model equations that possess advection and dispersion include the familiar barotropic beta plane equations @xcite and the dispersive surface quasigeostrophic ( sqg ) equations @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of such equations , highlighted by rhines @xcite in the barotropic beta plane case , is the co - existence of turbulent and wave - like motions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dispersive sqg equations have been proposed as an alternate ( more local ) platform for investigating wave - turbulence interactions @xcite . + in the present work , we look at an extended family ( that includes the aforementioned examples as members ) of dispersive active scalars .",
    "this is a simple dispersive generalization of the family of 2d turbulence models introduced in pierrehumbert , held & swanson @xcite .",
    "specifically , in a 2d periodic setting we consider    @xmath6    where @xmath7 denotes the 2d material derivative and @xmath2 is a non - dimensional parameter .",
    "note that in real space @xmath8 and @xmath9 above are related via a suitable ( pseudo- ) differential operator , i.e.  @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 2d laplacian , and for our purposes @xmath12 . for the beta plane equations we have @xmath13 , @xmath8 is the vorticity field , and @xmath2 corresponds to the rhines number @xmath14 . in the dispersive sqg case @xmath15 , @xmath8 represents the buoyancy ( or potential temperature @xcite ) , and @xmath16 .",
    "physically , of course we are dealing with very different scenarios wherein @xmath17 is the ambient planetary gradient of the vorticity while @xmath18 is the background surface buoyancy gradient . apart from @xmath19 ,",
    "there exist other members of this family that have physical interpretations @xcite .",
    "but , from a broader perspective , the entire family is well defined , and we expect that varying @xmath0 would provide greater insight into the interplay between advection and dispersion . + we begin examining the effect of @xmath0 on the dynamics by suppressing the dispersive term . after developing a feel for the dependence of the energy / enstrophy transfer and the geometry of the scalar field on @xmath0 , we introduce dispersion and note its modulating effect on the nonlinear term . in the limit @xmath20 , the so - called limiting dynamics",
    "are controlled by resonant interactions .",
    "in fact , the resonant skeleton corresponding to ( [ 1 ] ) is seen to be of the same form as that of the rotating three - dimensional ( 3d ) euler equations . following the original argument by rhines @xcite , for @xmath3 , if @xmath21 , the simultaneous transfer of energy to large scales and small frequencies leads to an anisotropic streamfunction ( resulting in predominantly zonal flow ) .",
    "in contrast , given the nature of the dispersion relation , it turns out that for @xmath22 the constraints of energy transfer to large scales and small frequencies do not require the spontaneous development of anisotropy in the streamfunction .",
    "confirming this via decaying runs from spatially un - correlated initial data , we proceed to a suite of forced / dissipative numerical simulations . in all cases , under weakly - local to local conditions ( i.e. @xmath4 )",
    "we note the formation of clear power - law scaling .",
    "the various slopes are extracted and compared with non - dispersive estimates .",
    "the paper ends with a collection of results and a brief discussion of potentially interesting avenues for future work .",
    "before considering the effect of dispersion , we examine the influence of @xmath0 in greater detail . to get a feel for the locality of the interactions , we shut off the linear dispersive term in ( [ 1 ] ) and consider a simple numerical exercise involving the evolution of a smooth @xmath8 ring . as is seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig0 ] ) , the deformation of the ring is more physically local for smaller @xmath0 . given that @xmath23 , as @xmath0 increases , one sees that only the small @xmath24 features of @xmath8 and @xmath9 remain dynamically active .",
    "as a result , for larger @xmath0 , smaller scale features of the scalar field are for all purposes driven in a passive manner .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath25 , only the wavenumber one ( @xmath26 ) component of @xmath8 and @xmath9 is coupled , and we end up with the problem of passive advection via a large - scale smooth flow .",
    "in contrast , the case of small @xmath0 is markedly different .",
    "specifically , @xmath27 results in a transition at @xmath28 ( when the scalar and velocity fields have similar scales ) , where for @xmath29 , the velocity fields are in fact of a finer scale than the advected scalar field .",

    "+ to develop a feel for the dependence of the geometry of an emergent scalar field on @xmath0 , we continue with non - dispersive simulations , though now from spatially un - correlated initial data chosen from a gaussian distribution with unit variance .",

    "therefore , to satisfy the dual constraints , rhines @xcite suggested that the system would spontaneously generate anisotropic structures ; further examining ( [ 2 ] ) shows that these constraints are satisfied for @xmath65 . also , when considering energy transfer into large scales , i.e.  @xmath66 , interactions that fall in the aforementioned anisotropic category are in fact near - resonant @xcite .",
    "in essence we have an anisotropic streamfunction that results in predominantly zonal flows .",
    "though note that for @xmath22 , decreasing @xmath24 implies smaller frequencies , therefore it is possible to maintain isotropy while simultaneously transferring energy to large scales and small frequencies .",

    "note that this does not imply zonal flows can not form for @xmath22 , in fact , substituting an expansion of the form @xmath67 , the @xmath68 balance in ( [ 1 ] ) yields @xmath69 .",
    "of course , this expansion does nt imply any control over the higher order terms , but irrespective of @xmath0 , at order zero , it indicates the possibility of zonal flow formation .",
    "+ a different , though complementary , approach to the generation of zonal flows is to view ( [ 1 ] ) as a mixing problem , i.e.  to consider the mixing of @xmath8 in the presence of a background gradient @xcite . in the context of the beta plane equations ,",
    "as shown by rhines & young @xcite , steady flows with closed streamlines ( or gyres ) result in the homogenization of potential vorticity between these streamlines . with a linear background , this naturally leads to a `` saw - tooth '' vorticity profile with high gradients concentrated on the streamlines @xcite .",
    "further in a statistically steady state , this reasoning posits the existence of successive `` saw - tooth '' structures in the vorticity profile ( or in other words a potential vorticity `` staircase '' ) if the size of the eddies is smaller than the size of the domain @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite for forced- dissipative simulations and @xcite for experimental results in this regard ) . from this viewpoint localized zonal flows ( jets )",
    "result from an inversion of the aforementioned potential vorticity `` staircase '' .",
    "for the general family in ( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath70 is mixed by the flow and a similar homogenization within streamlines is expected to follow .",
    "further , as the scale of the velocity field becomes smaller than that of the advected scalar when @xmath0 crosses @xmath71 from above , we expect the homogenization for small @xmath0 to progress in a more diffusive manner , i.e.  small - scale inhomogeneties will be erased earlier which supports a gradual explusion of scalar gradients from small to large scales . in this vein ,",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) , much like the classic picture by mcintyre , reproduced in dritschel & mcintyre @xcite , shows the inversion of a single `` saw - tooth '' using the general form in ( [ 1 ] ) . as is evident  apart from the known asymmetry in the east - west jets in the beta plane equations  the more local the inversion ( i.e.  for smaller @xmath0 ) the narrower and stronger are the corresponding jets .",

    "@xcite , i.e.  the first entry in a triplet @xmath79 evolves via the interaction of the latter two entries , the limiting ( @xmath20 ) dynamics are made up of :    * @xmath80 i.e.  the slow - slow - slow ( @xmath81 ) interactions : all such interactions between purely zonal flows are clearly resonant .",
    "however , from ( [ 4 ] ) we see that their interaction coefficients are zero .",
    "* @xmath82 , @xmath83 i.e.  slow - fast - fast @xmath84 or fast - slow - fast @xmath85 interactions : it is easy to check that two modes with @xmath56 can not feed ( extract ) energy to ( from ) one with @xmath86 . in other words , two fast modes can not generate a zonal flow .",
    "on the other hand , two fast modes can interact with each other using a zonal mode as a catalyst and this represents the passive advection of the fast modes via a zonal shear flow . * @xmath87 i.e.  the fast - fast - fast @xmath88 interactions : these are the three - fast wave interactions .",
    "though they are algebraically difficult to achieve , these interactions represent fully 2d motion .    as is evident , this situation is entirely analogous to the analysis of the beta plane equations as presented by longuet - higgins & gill @xcite .",
    "further , there is a close correspondence between these resonant interactions and the limiting dynamics ( i.e.  when the rossby number @xmath89 ) of rotating three - dimensional ( 3d ) flows . for the 3d rotating case @xcite , the analogous set of @xmath90 interactions result in purely 2d flow ( though now with a non - zero interaction coefficient ) ; the second set of @xmath85 interactions leads to the passive advection of the vertical velocity via this 2d flow and inclusion of the third set of @xmath88 resonances yields the so - called @xmath91 dimensional equations .",
    "further , transfer from exclusively fast to slow modes in pure rotation is also precluded under resonance , i.e.   @xmath84 interaction has a zero interaction coefficient , where the zero frequency mode corresponds to a columnar structure .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath20 ( rossby number @xmath89 ) , it is not possible generate a zonal flow ( columnar structure ) from exclusively non - zonal ( non - columnar ) initial data and forcing .",
    "+ of course , the limit @xmath20 is usually not of great physical interest , in fact we are usually more concerned with situations wherein @xmath3 .",
    "this opens the door to non - resonant interactions , and quite naturally , we expect near - resonances  i.e.  triads for which @xmath92  to be of greater significance than the remainder that are , in terms of ( @xmath93 , far from resonance . as the @xmath84 non - resonant triads have a non - zero interaction co - efficient we have the possibility of directly transferring energy from non - zonal to zonal modes .",
    "choosing @xmath94 for given @xmath2 , such transfer to slow modes has been numerically verified in the beta plane and 3d rotating systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "with the aim of examining a systematic transfer of energy / enstrophy from one scale to another , we proceed to numerical simulations from weakly non - local to local conditions ( i.e.@xmath4 ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme is a de - aliased psuedospectral method with fourth order runge - kutta time stepping .",
    "all simulations are performed in matlab at a resolution of @xmath95 .",
    "further , we supplement the rhs of ( [ 1 ] ) with hyper - viscous dissipation of the form @xmath96 ( to act as a sink at small scales , with @xmath97 ) . as per maltrud & vallis @xcite",
    "we choose @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the maximum resolved wavenumber .",
    "+ denoting the domain , forcing and dissipation scales by @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , we consider @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) which allows us achieve , for a given resolution , as large an inverse ( forward ) energy ( enstrophy ) transfer regime as is possible .",
    "the forcing is of random phase at every time - step and de - correlates with a time - scale @xmath104 ( this is chosen to be comparable to the fastest linear wave in the model ) . further the forcing is localized to a few wavenumbers , and it is important to note  especially in the context of a small - scale case  that our forcing is not chosen in a `` ring '' of waveneumbers ( i.e.  it is not localized by means of @xmath105 ) but rather , we strictly ensure that there is no projection of the forcing on small @xmath106 or @xmath107 ( i.e.the localization is by means of @xmath108 ) .",
    "this ensures that if we see the formation of zonal flows , it is due to the transfer of energy from modes that are , in a sense , `` far from zonal '' to zonal and near - zonal modes @xcite .",
    "finally , we also include a linear damping on the largest scales , of the form @xmath109 , which allows us to achieve a stationary state . in some of the inverse transfer simulations the time required to achieve stationarity is prohibitively large . in such cases the runs are halted when the power - law scaling ceases to evolve ( i.e.  only the very largest scales are still growing ) .",
    "as mentioned , in the context of the beta plane equations , one observes the spontaneous generation of zonal flows from isotropic random small - scale forcing ( recent numerical simulations can be found in @xcite , @xcite ) . in line with rhines argument for a non - isotropic streamfunction and dominant zonal flow , the reasoning  supported by numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite  is that , the upscale transfer of energy is isotropic up to the so - called rhines scale , beyond which energy is preferentially deposited anisotropically in wavenumbers that satisfy @xmath110 @xcite,@xcite . in terms of the scaling",

    "indeed , the rapid emergence of fine - scale features in the @xmath8 field ( implying a forward transfer of @xmath8 variance ) was seen to yield a relatively high - wavenumber @xmath122 enstrophy spectrum .",
