    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interaction has been remarkably successful in describing physics below the fermi scale and is in good agreement with the most experiment data .",
    "one of the most promising processes for probing the quark - flavor sector of the sm is the rare decays .",
    "these decays , induced by the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) which occur in the sm only at loop level , play an important role in the phenomenology of particle physics and in searching for the physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the observation of the penguin - induced decay @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 are in good agreement with the sm prediction , and the first evidence for the decay @xmath6 was confirmed at the end of 2012 @xcite , putting strong constraints on its various extensions .",
    "nevertheless , these processes are also important in determining the parameters of the sm and some hadronic parameters in qcd , such as the ckm matrix elements , the meson decay constant @xmath7 , providing information on heavy meson wave functions .",
    "thanks to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern we have entered a new era of particle physics . in experimental side , in the current early phase of the lhc era , the exclusive modes such as @xmath8 @xmath9 are among the most promising decays due to their relative cleanliness and sensitivity to models beyond the sm @xcite . in theoretically side , since no helicity suppression exists and large branching ratios as @xmath10 are expected .",
    "there are mainly two kinds of contributions of @xmath8 in the sm : the short distance contribution which can be evaluated reliably by perturbation theory @xcite while the long distance qcd effects describing the neutral vector - meson resonances @xmath11 and @xmath12 family @xcite . as for the short distance contribution ,",
    "it is thought in previous works that a necessary work is only attaching real photon to any charged internal and external lines in the feynman diagrams of @xmath13 with statement that contributions from the attachment of photon to any charged internal propagator are regraded as to be strongly suppressed and can be neglected safely   @xcite , i.e. , one can easily obtain the amplitude of @xmath8 by using the effective weak hamiltonian of @xmath13 and the matrix elements @xmath14 @xmath15 directly .",
    "therefore contributions from the attachment of real photon with magnetic - penguin vertex to any charged external lines are of course omitted @xcite or stated to be negligibly small  @xcite .",
    "another contribution from loop insertion of the lower order four - quark operators are also always neglected .",
    "we note that the complete contribution seems to have been done in @xcite , however it mainly concentrated on the long distance effects of the meson resonances , whereas the short distance contribution was indeed incompletely analyzed .",
    "a complete examination included all contribution to the processes in the sm is needed .",
    "as being well known , only short - distance contribution can be reliably predicted , and it is more important than the long - distance contribution from the resonances which is actually excluded partly by setting cuts in experimental measurements .",
    "recently we showed that the contributions from the attachment of real photon with magnetic - penguin vertex to any charged external lines can enhance the branching ratios of @xmath8 by a factor about 2 @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we will extend our previous studies and use the @xmath0 meson wave function extracted from non - leptonic @xmath0 decays @xcite to revaluate the short distance contribution from the all categories of diagrams of @xmath2 decays .",
    "special attention will be payed on the contribution from the four - quark operators , and a comparative study with previous work will be discussed .",
    "the paper are organized in the following , in sec .",
    "[ sec : hami ] , we analyse the full short distance contribution and present detail calculation of exclusive decays @xmath8 .",
    "the numerical results and the comparative study are given in sec .",

    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "in order to simplify the decay amplitude for @xmath2 , we have to utilize the @xmath0 meson wave function , which is not known from the first principal and model depended .",
    "fortunately , many studies on non - leptonic @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath0 decays @xcite have constrained the wave function strictly .",
    "it was found that the wave function has form @xmath17 where the distribution amplitude @xmath18 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the momentum fractions shared by @xmath21 quark in @xmath0 meson .",

    "which are subject to the qcd corrected effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "the general effective hamiltonian that describes @xmath27 transition is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) stands for the four - quark operators , and the forms and the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath31 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    generally , to describe all the short distance of the process @xmath8",

    "[ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "when connect di - lepton line to one @xmath34 , operator @xmath32 may contribute to @xmath8 .",
    "contributions from the such kind of diagrams with a photon attaching from internal charged lines to @xmath8 are usually regraded as to be strongly suppressed by a factor @xmath35 thus can be neglected safely   @xcite . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the conclusion of this is correct , but the explanation is not as what it is described .",
    "here we address the reason more clearly : the contribution from diagrams fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) are not suppressed . when applying effective vertex of @xmath33 to describe @xmath32 as shown in fig .",

    "we have proven that the such two non - suppressed effects in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] cancel each other exactly @xcite .",
    "therefore we can use the effective operators listed in eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) for on - shell quarks to calculate the total short distance contributions of @xmath8 in sm safely .",
    "the feynmann diagrams contributing to @xmath8 at parton level can then be classified into three kinds as follows :    1 .   attaching a real photon to any charged external lines in the feynman diagrams of @xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "attaching a virtual photon to any charged external lines in the feynman diagrams of @xmath33 with virtual photon into lepton pairs ; 3 .   attaching two photon to any",

    "we found that the contributions are large , leading to the branching ratio of @xmath2 being nearly enhanced by a factor 3 . in the current early phase of the lhc era , the exclusive modes with muon final states are among the most promising decays .",

    "experimentally , @xmath127 mode is one of the main backgrounds to @xmath128 , and thus it is already taken into account in @xmath128 searches @xcite .",

    "<S> using the @xmath0 meson wave function extracted from non - leptonic @xmath0 decays , we evaluate the short distance contribution of rare decays @xmath1 in the standard model , including all the possible diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the contribution from four - quark operators which are not taken into account properly in previous researches . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the contribution is large , leading to the branching ratio of @xmath2 being nearly enhanced by a factor 3 and up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for such processes can be tested in the lhc - b and b factories in near future . </S>"
