    "the function @xmath0 was taken in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant parameter with dimensions of a mass and of the same order of magnitude as the present hubble parameter ( or inverse universe age ) , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 gyr is the universe age .",

    "this choice of @xmath0 leads to a further problem , namely the solution of the equation of motion for the gravitational field must be singular with @xmath12 in the past to produce a reasonable late - time cosmology  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has been found that systems with rising mass / energy density will evolve to a @xmath13 singularity in the future  @xcite .",
    "the singularity can be avoided if one adds an extra term @xmath14  @xcite . at small @xmath15",
    "the system tends to evolve to higher values of curvature , but as @xmath16 grows the @xmath17-term eventually becomes dominant and pushes the system back to lower curvatures .",
    "this results in oscillating solutions @xmath18 , possibly with very large amplitude . in our papers @xcite",

    "the time evolution of first - order perturbations is governed by a fourth - order differential equation ( instead of the usual second order one ) , therefore new types of unstable solutions are expected , and have in fact been found .    there appear not only the usual jeans solution with a slightly modified ( reduced ) length scale , but also parametric resonance amplification of density perturbations , and an amplification of the perturbations due to the `` antifriction '' behaviour of the coefficients of odd derivatives ( first and third ) in the equation .",

    "the fourier transform over space variables can be applied straightforwardly only if the coefficients in these equations are space - independent .",

    "@xmath74 , so that we can completely neglect this term , the fourier transformation can be safely applied .",
    "however , neglecting this term we exclude the effect of time dependent background , which leads to new forms of instability .",
    "nevertheless , we can take into account the effects of @xmath73-dependent terms and justify the applicability of the fourier transformation both in the limits of large and small @xmath73 .    in the care of large @xmath73 the fourier transformation is applicable in the adiabatic case , when the background quantities change little over one wavelength of perturbations , @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , performing the fourier transform of the equations essentially consists in multiplying them by @xmath76 and integrating over @xmath77 .",
    "if the coefficients of the linear equations for infinitesimal perturbations do not depend upon space coordinates we come as usual to an algebraic system of linear equations for the fourier modes of the fluctuations . if , as is our case , some coefficients in the original differential equations depend upon @xmath73 , then we can still transform our equations taking the integral @xmath78 not over the whole space but in some neighbourhood of a fixed value @xmath79 with radius @xmath80 , chosen so that the space dependent coefficients are practically constant in such neighbourhood . to this end",
    "it is necessary that the range of integration contain many wave lengths , i.e. @xmath81 , and at the same time that @xmath80 be sufficiently small , so that the @xmath73-dependent coefficients may be considered as approximately constant . due to the largeness of @xmath82 , such an integral would be close to the real fourier transform with infinite integration limits .",
    "this essentially allows us to treat @xmath73 as a constant parameter .",
    "our final results will of course depend on such coordinate , in fact we will present results obtained in the two different limits @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the former condition is the more natural one , because the adiabatic approximation essentially implies @xmath85 and most values of @xmath73 are smaller but roughly of the same order of magnitude of the limit radius @xmath44 .",
    "the latter condition holds only near the centre of the cloud , that is for relatively small values of @xmath73 ; however , this may be a non negligible portion of the total system .",

    "the oscillating background metric and curvature of the system induce an effect analogous to the standard parametric resonance , resulting in an amplification of the fluctuations .",

    "we used a similar approach concerning the form of the oscillating metric and curvature background , considering the two cases of arbitrary harmonic oscillations and spike - like solutions of the type found in our previous work  @xcite . in both cases the evolution of perturbations is described by a fourth order equation , in which odd derivatives may play a crucial role .",
    "they describe the damping due to friction if their coefficients are positive ( this is the usual case in the standard parametric resonance theory ) .",
    "however , such coefficients may periodically change sign and this leads to a periodic antifriction force and to a consequent amplification of perturbations .",
    "the latter effect occurs at rather high amplitude of curvature oscillations , higher than the background gr value .",
    "systems where curvature oscillations with large amplitude are induced have been found in our work  @xcite .",
    "the fourth order equations  ( [ z-4order ] ) or  ( [ eq_z-4order - abc ] ) , which govern the evolution of the density perturbations , demonstrate a very rich pattern of different types of instabilities .",
    "there is a close analogue of parametric resonance , which is easy to describe theoretically , almost in the same way as the usual parametric resonance .",
    "however , in addition to this we found a new kind of instability induced by negative signs of the coefficients in front of the odd derivatives in the equation  we dub it the antifriction instability . interestingly this instability generates a completely different behaviour of the rising perturbations , depending upon the values of the system parameters .",
    "there can be an oscillating behaviour with quickly rising amplitude , or a quasi - explosive one with amplitude tending monotonically to infinity .",
    "of course these results are reliable only if perturbations are sufficiently small , not larger than unity when written in dimensionless form .    we have studied  ( [ z-4order ] ) analytically and numerically , solving for the perturbation in the space - space metric term . based on these solutions",
    ", one can calculate the evolution of the relative density contrast using  ( [ delta - rho ] ) . barring accidental cancellations , exponentially growing solutions for @xmath202 will lead to an equivalent behaviour for the density perturbation @xmath306 , as shows in fig .",

    "the effective time can be much shorter than the gravitational time typical for the jeans - type rise of density perturbations , since @xmath32 is usually large .",
    "though the density contrast is an oscillating function of time , its impact on structure formation may be non - negligible and should lead to constraints on the parameters of the underlying @xmath0-theory .",
    "this will be studied elsewhere .",
    "another potentially interesting effect of the oscillating rise of curvature perturbations is the generation of curvature propagation around contracting bodies , i.e. a scalar mode for gravitational waves having mass equal to @xmath32 , which may vary from practically zero up to the scalaron mass @xmath312 .",
