    "this has to be understood as a collection of smooth functions @xmath6 defined in trivializing neighborhoods @xmath7 of the line bundle . if @xmath8 is a frame in @xmath7 , then @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath6 must satisfy the compatibilty condition @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the transition functions .    as usual",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the global holomorphic sections .",
    "if @xmath13 is a line bundle over @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a line bundle over @xmath16 , we denote by @xmath17 the line bundle over the product manifold @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the projection onto the first factor and @xmath21 is the projection onto the second .",
    "the line bundle @xmath22 carries a metric induced by that of @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "given a basis @xmath23 of @xmath12 we define @xmath24 as a section of @xmath25 over @xmath26 by the identities @xmath27 .",

    "[ def1 ] let @xmath30 .",
    "a @xmath0-ensemble is an @xmath31 point random process on @xmath14 which has joint distribution given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is chosen so that this is a probability distribution in @xmath34 .",
    "observe that the random point process is independent of the choice of basis @xmath35 .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when @xmath36 , since then the process is determinantal .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the bergman kernel of the hilbert space @xmath12 endowed with the norm @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 denotes the norm induced by the metric @xmath5 ( see section  [ sec2 ] for more details ) .",
    "then @xmath40    another interesting situation occurs when @xmath41 . in this case the probability charges the maxima of the function @xmath42 .",
    "a set of points @xmath43 with cardinality @xmath44 and maximizing this determinant is known as a fekete sequence .",
    "the distribution of these sequences has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and we will draw some ideas from there to study general @xmath0-ensembles .",
    "we consider now the situation where we replace @xmath13 by a power @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 tend to infinity .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the dimension of @xmath49 .",
    "it is well - known , by the riemann - roch theorem and the kodaira vanishing theorem , that @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the first chern class of @xmath13 .    for each @xmath47",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath48 points chosen randomly according to the law . for each @xmath47",
    "the collection is picked independently of the previous ones .",
    "given points @xmath52 chosen according to , consider its associated empirical measure @xmath53 .",
    "for convenience we will drop the superindex @xmath54 hereafter .",
    "we are interested in understanding the limiting distribution of the measures @xmath55 .",
    "the following result is well known ; see @xcite .",
    "[ fekete_distribution ] let @xmath55 be the empirical measure associated to a fekete sequence for the bundle @xmath56 . then , as @xmath57 , @xmath58 in the weak-@xmath59 topology .",
    "the measure @xmath60 is called the equilibrium measure .",
    "there is a counterpart of this result for empirical measures of general @xmath0-ensembles ( see @xcite , which gives an estimate for the large deviations of the empirical measure from the equilibrium measure ) .",
    "our aim is to obtain a different quantitative version of the weak convergence of the empirical measure to the equilibrium measure , measured in terms of the kantorovich - wasserstein distance between mesaures .",
    "this sort of quantification has also been studied , with different tools , in the context of random matrix models , ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where similar determinantal point processes arise ) .    in fact some of the @xmath0-ensembles we are considering admit random matrix models , at least when @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , krishnapur studied in @xcite the following point process : let @xmath62 be @xmath63 random matrices with i.i.d .  complex gaussian entries .",
    "he proved that the generalized eigenvalues associated with the pair @xmath64 , i.e.  the eigenvalues of @xmath65 , have joint probability density : @xmath66 with respect to the lebesgue measure in the plane .    it was also observed in @xcite that , using the stereographic projection @xmath67 the joint density ( with respect to the product area measure in the product of spheres ) is @xmath68 since this is invariant under rotations of the sphere , the point process is called the spherical ensemble .",
    "a point process with this law had been considered earlier  without a random matrix model  by caillol @xcite as the model of one - component plasma .",
    "one typical instance of the process is as in the picture .",
    "the spherical ensemble has received much attention .",
    "we mention a couple of properties related to our results . in @xcite",
    ", bordenave proves the universality of the spectral distribution of the @xmath63-matrix @xmath65 with respect to other i.i.d .",
    "random distribution of entries . as an outcome",
    ", he proves that the weak- * limit of the spectral measures @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are the generalized eigenvalues is the normalized area measure in the sphere .",
    "this convergence is rather uniform : in @xcite alishahi and sadegh zamani estimate the discrepancy of the empirical measure with respect to its limit and give precise estimates of the newtonian and the logarithmic energies .      to measure the uniformity and speed of convergence of the empirical measures @xmath55 to the limiting measure @xmath60 we use the kantorovich - wasserstein distance @xmath71 .",
    "given probability measures @xmath72 and @xmath60 , it is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the distance associated to the metric @xmath3 and the infimum is taken over all admissible transport plans @xmath75 , i.e. , all probability measures in @xmath76 with marginal measures @xmath72 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "in general , the kantorovich - wasserstein distance is defined on probability measures over a compact metric space @xmath14 , and it metrizes the weak-@xmath59 convergence of measures .    it was observed in @xcite that in the definition of @xmath71 it is possible to enlarge the class of admissible transport plans to complex measures @xmath75 that have marginals @xmath72 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "we include the argument for the sake of completness .",
    "let @xmath77 of all complex measures @xmath75 on @xmath78 with marginals @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in order to see that @xmath81 , we recall the dual formulation of @xmath71 ( see @xcite*formula  ( 6.3 ) ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the collection of all functions @xmath84 on @xmath14 satisfying @xmath85 .    for any complex measure @xmath75 with marginals @xmath72 and @xmath60 and any @xmath86 we have @xmath87 hence @xmath88 ) is trivial .",
    "a standard reference for basic facts on kantorovich - wasserstein distances is the book @xcite .",
    "we fix now a basis of sections @xmath89 of @xmath49 . given any collection of points @xmath90 we define the lagrange sections informally as : @xmath91 clearly @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    more formally , we proceed as in @xcite : if @xmath96 is a frame in a neighborhood @xmath97 of the point @xmath98 , then the sections @xmath99 are represented on each @xmath97 by scalar functions @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , the metric @xmath102 is represented on @xmath97 by a smooth real - valued function @xmath103 such that @xmath104 .    to construct the lagrange sections we denote by @xmath105 the matrix @xmath106 and",
    "define @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the determinant of the submatrix obtained from @xmath105 by removing the @xmath109-th row and @xmath110-th column .",
    "clearly @xmath111 , and it is not difficult to check that @xmath112 @xmath113 .",
    "notice that if we denote by @xmath114 then @xmath115 and thus @xmath116 . in the case of the fekete points ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "@xmath118 by definition .",
    "[ main ] consider the empirical measure @xmath55 associated to the @xmath0-ensemble given in definition  [ def1 ] and let @xmath119 be the equilibrium measure",
    ". then @xmath120    the rate of convergence can not be improved .",
    "let @xmath29 be any nowhere vanishing smooth probability distribution on @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath121 be any discrete set on @xmath14 with cardinality @xmath122 , and let @xmath123 .",
    "then the distance @xmath124 .",
    "to obtain a lower bound for @xmath125 we use the dual formulation of the kantorovich - wasserstein distance and the function @xmath126 , which is in @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath127 on the support of @xmath55 we obtain @xmath128 vitali s covering lemma ensures that for each @xmath47 and for some @xmath129 small enough , independent of @xmath47 , there are at least @xmath130 pairwise disjoint balls of radius @xmath131 .",
    "since the number of balls is twice the number of points in @xmath121 , at least half the balls contain no point of @xmath121 .",
    "we consider one such ball , @xmath132 . in the smaller ball",
    "@xmath133 we have @xmath134 .",
    "thus    @xmath135    to prove this we provide a ( complex ) transport plan between the probability measure @xmath136 ",
    "@xmath137 stands for _ bergman measure _  and the empirical measure @xmath55 .",
    "we are going to prove that @xmath138 standard estimates for the bergman kernel provide : @xmath139 actually one can prove that the total variation ( which dominates the kantorovich - wasserstein distance ) satisfies : @xmath140 this follows for instance by the expansion in powers of @xmath141 of the bergman kernel . in this context",
    "this is due to tian , catlin and zelditch , @xcite .    in the particular case of the spherical ensemble ,",
    "the kernel is explicit and invariant under rotations , and the estimate is even better : the bergman measure is the equilibrium measure , i.e. @xmath142 .    consider the transport plan @xmath143 it has the correct marginals  @xmath137 and @xmath55 respectively  and thus @xmath144 be the conjugate exponent of @xmath0 ( so that @xmath145 ) , we have @xmath146 then , by , we obtain : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } ( \\mathbb{e } w)^\\beta&\\le \\left(\\frac c{\\sqrt{k}}\\right)^{\\beta/\\beta ' }   \\int_{x }   \\frac   1{n_k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_k } \\int_{x }    & = \\left(\\frac c{\\sqrt{k}}\\right)^{\\beta/\\beta ' }   \\int_{x^{n_k } }   \\frac 1{n_k}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_k } \\int_{x }    finally , integrating first in @xmath98 and applying again we obtain @xmath148 as desired .",
    "estimate follows from the pointwise estimate for the bergman kernel @xmath149 which holds when the line bundle is positive , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider the function @xmath150 strictly decreasing in @xmath151 for any @xmath152 we bound the integral in ( [ offdiagonal ] ) as @xmath153 where the last estimate follows from @xmath154 and @xmath155    in the particular case of the spherical ensemble , the kernel is explicit and the decay is even faster :    @xmath156    where here @xmath157 coincides with the chordal metric .",
    "now we turn our attention to the almost sure convergence of the empirical measure . using the fact that lipschitz functionals of determinantal process concentrate the measure around the mean we prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath60 be , as before , the normalized equilibrium measure .",
