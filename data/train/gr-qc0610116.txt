    "it is safe to say that we are still a considerable distance from a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity .",
    "pursuit of this goal is taking place on many fronts , one of which involves working in a two dimensional setting .",
    "this furnishes a dynamically simplified framework for developing methods that might be generalizable to higher dimensional quantum gravity , as well as yielding potential insight into quantization of a restricted number of degrees of freedom of such theories .",
    "although the einstein vacuum field equations in two spacetime dimensions are trivial insofar as they are satisfied by any metric , it is nevertheless possible to construct dynamically interesting theories in this setting .",
    "this can be done by coupling a scalar field ( called the dilaton ) into the theory and including suitable matter sources , which typically include the dilaton itself .",
    "this has the unfortunate drawback that the theory under consideration typically does not resemble general relativity in its lower - dimensional setting , although some two - dimensional theories are equivalent to a reduction of higher - dimensional einstein gravity to spherical symmetry @xcite . however in their own two - dimensional context , such theories in general do not have a sensible newtonian limit and/or post - newtonian expansion @xcite",
    ".    however it has been shown that one can take the @xmath6 limit of general relativity by suitably rescaling newton s constant @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the resultant theory is one in which the ricci scalar @xmath8 is set equal to the trace of the stress energy of prescribed matter fields and sources . in this sense the theory models ( 3 + 1)-dimensional general relativity in a manner not captured by other dilaton theories of gravity : the evolution of space - time curvature is governed by the matter distribution , which in turn is governed by the dynamics of space - time @xcite",
    ". referred to as @xmath9  theory , when the stress energy is that of a cosmological constant , it reduces to jackiw - teitelboim theory @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath9 theory is that it has a consistent nonrelativistic ( @xmath10 ) limit @xcite that yields ( 1 + 1)-dimensional newtonian gravity .",
    "its quantization is therefore of considerable potential interest insofar as its ( quantum ) newtonian limit can indirectly be empirically tested .",
    "this is because the effective theory of gravity near the earth s surface is ( 1 + 1)-dimensional newtonian gravity , whose potential increases linearly with separation away from the surface . from early experimental tests indicating that spin-1/2 particles undergo gravity - induced phase shifts @xcite to more recent work demonstrating that neutrons experience a quantization of energy levels in this potential @xcite",
    ", 2d newtonian quantum gravity affords an important empirical window into semiclassical quantum gravity . in attempting to understand ( at least qualitatively )",
    "how relativistic effects could modify this behaviour the @xmath9 theory can therefore play an important role .    in this paper",
    "we take the first steps toward quantization of the @xmath9 theory .",
    "we proceed by taking as a matter source a minimally coupled pair of point particles , forming a 2-body relativistic self - gravitating system .",
    "nonrelativistic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional self - gravitating systems ( ogs ) of n particles have been very important in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology for over 30 years @xcite , since they not only furnish prototypes for studying gravity in higher dimensions , but also provide effective descriptions of physical systems whose dynamics are closely approximated by the one dimensional system .",
    "the ogs phase space is known to exhibit solutions corresponding to very long - lived core - halo configurations , reminiscent of structures observed in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the ogs also approximates collisions of flat parallel domain walls moving in directions orthogonal to their surfaces as well as the dynamics of stars in a direction perpendicular to the plane of a highly flattened galaxy .",
    "relativistic self - gravitating systems have only been more recently studied , primarily in the 2-body @xcite and 3-body @xcite cases .    in the 2-body case a broad class of exact solutions",
    "have been obtained , with extensions that include electromagnetism and cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is explicitly known as a function of the canonical position and momentum variables . as such",
    "its quantization would yield a version of quantum gravity coupled to matter  perhaps the simplest non - trivial quantum gravity system  that affords direct comparison to a classical counterpart .",
    "however the nonlinearities of the hamiltonian yield significant challenges , eg .",
    "operator - ordering problems . here",
    "we proceed by quantizing the post - newtonian expansion of @xmath9 theory .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion for the n - body system has been previously carried out @xcite .",
    "we consider this expansion for @xmath11 , regarding the post - newtonian terms as perturbative corrections to ( 1 + 1 ) newtonian gravity .",
    "we find that relativistic corrections tend to lower the ground state energy but raise the energy of all excited states .",
    "furthermore , such corrections tend to spread the wavefunction , indicating a less tightly bound system than in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a short review of the relativistic @xmath12-body system , outlining briefly how the exact hamiltonian for the relativistic 2-body system is obtained .",
    "we then discuss the post - newtonian expansion of this hamiltonian . in section 3",
    "we review the quantization of the non - relativistic system and then in section 4 obtain the post - newtonian corrections to this system . in section 5",
    "we consider the limits of validity of this approximation , and in section 6 finish off with some concluding remarks .",
