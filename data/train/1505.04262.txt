    "phase - locked loop based circuits ( pll ) are widely used in various applications .",
    "a pll is essentially a nonlinear control system and its nonlinear analysis is a challenging task .",
    "much engineering writing is devoted to the study of pll - based circuits and the various characteristics for their stability ( see , e.g. a rather comprehensive bibliography of pioneering works in @xcite ) .",
    "an important engineering characteristic of pll is a set of parameters values for which a pll achieves lock . in the classical books on plls @xcite , published in 1966 , such concepts as hold - in , pull - in , lock - in , and other frequency ranges for which pll can achieve lock ,",
    "were introduced .",
    "they are widely used nowadays ( see , e.g. contemporary engineering literature @xcite and other publications ) .",
    "usually in engineering literature only non - strict definitions are given for these concepts .",
    "f.  gardner in 1979 in the 2nd edition of his well - known work , _ phaselock techniques _ , formulated the following problem @xcite ( see also the 3rd edition @xcite ) : `` _ there is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock - in frequency _ '' .",
    "the lack of rigorous explanations led to the paradox : `` _ despite its vague reality , lock - in range is a useful concept _ ''",
    "many years of using definitions based on the above concepts has led to the advice given in a handbook on synchronization and communications , namely to check the definitions carefully before using them @xcite .",
    "in this paper it is shown that , from a mathematical point of view , in some cases the hold - in and pull - in `` ranges '' may be not intervals of values but a union of intervals , and thus their widely used definitions require clarification .",
    "next , rigorous mathematical definitions for the hold - in , pull - in , and lock - in ranges are given .",
    "in addition we suggest an effective solution for the problem of the unique definition of the lock - in frequency , posed by gardner .",
    "in classical engineering publications various analog pll - based circuits are represented in a _ signal s phase space _ ( also named _ frequency - domain _",

    "the phase detector ( pd ) is a nonlinear block ; the phases @xmath0 of the input ( reference ) and vco signals are pd block inputs and the output is a function @xmath1 named a _ phase detector characteristic _ , where @xmath2 named the phase error .",
    "the relationship between the input @xmath3 and the output @xmath4 of the linear filter ( loop filter ) is as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant matrix , @xmath7 the filter state , @xmath8 the initial state of filter , @xmath9 and @xmath10 constant vectors , and h a number .",
    "the filter transfer function has the form : ] @xmath11 a lead - lag filter @xcite ( usually @xmath12 , but @xmath13 can also be any nonzero value when an active lead - lag filter is used ) , or a pi filter ( @xmath13 is infinite ) is usually used as the filter .",
    "the solution of with initial data @xmath8 ( the filter output for the initial state @xmath8 ) is as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the impulse response function of the filter and @xmath16 the zero input response ( natural response , i.e. when the input of the filter is zero ) .",
    "the control signal @xmath4 adjusts the vco frequency to the frequency of the input signal : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vco free - running frequency ( i.e. for @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 the vco gain .",
    "nonlinear vco models can be similarly considered , see , e.g. @xcite .",

    "note that the pd characteristic @xmath27 depends on the waveforms of the considered signals @xcite ) . for the classical pll with sinusoidal signals and a two - phase pll we have @xmath28 , for the classical bpsk costas loop with ideal low - pass filters and a two - phase costas loop we have @xmath29 .",

    "the locked states ( also called steady states ) of the model in the signal s phase space must satisfy the following conditions :    * the phase error @xmath25 is constant , the frequency error @xmath37 is zero ; * the model in a locked state approaches the same locked state after small perturbations ( of the vco phase , input signal phase , and filter state ) .",
    "the locally asymptotically stable equilibrium ( stationary ) points of model : @xmath38 are locked states , i.e. satisfy the above conditions must be constant in the locked state @xcite . ] .    considering the case of a nonsingular matrix @xmath6 ( i.e. the transfer function of the filter does not have zero poles ) , the equilibria of ( stationary points )",
    "are given by the equations @xmath39 thus , the equilibria can be considered as a multiple - valued function of variable @xmath22 : @xmath40 . from the boundedness of the pd characteristic @xmath41",
    "it follows that there are no equilibria for sufficiently large @xmath42 .",
    "the widely used engineering assumption ( see viterbi s pioneering writing @xcite ) is that the zero input response of filter @xmath43 does not affect the synchronization of the loop .",
    "this assumption allows the filter state @xmath44 to be excluded from the consideration and a _ simplified mathematical model of pll - based circuit in the signal s phase space _ to be obtained from and ( see , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "another possible reason , as noted in @xcite , is that the nonlinear analysis techniques are well beyond the scope of most undergraduate courses in communication theory and circuits design .",

    "some needed explanations are given by viterbi @xcite using phase plane analysis .",
    "but , even in such a simple case , rigorous phase plane analysis is a complex task ( e.g. @xcite , the proof of the nonexistence of heteroclinic and first - order cycles is omitted in @xcite ) . the rigorous analytical proof can be effectively achieved by considering a special lyapunov function @xcite : @xmath191 and @xmath192 . here",

    "it is interesting that for simplified model with @xmath45 ( see eq .  2.20 in the classic reference @xcite ) the absolute value of the initial difference between frequencies @xmath198 is equal to the frequency deviation @xmath194 . following such simplified consideration in engineering literature the concept of an `` _ initial frequency difference",
    "_ '' can be found to be in use instead of the concept of a `` _ frequency deviation _ '' : see , e.g. @xcite `` _ if the initial frequency difference ( between vco and input ) is within the pull - in range , the vco frequency will slowly change in a direction to reduce the difference _ '' , @xcite `` _ the maximum frequency difference between the input and the output that the pll can lock within one single beat note is called the lock - in range of the pll _ '' , @xcite `` _ whether the pll can get synchronized at all or not depends on the initial frequency difference between the input signal and the output of the controlled oscillator . _ '' in general",
    ", the change of @xmath18 to @xmath195 may lead to wrong results in the above definitions of ranges because in the case of @xmath199 , @xmath200 or non - odd function @xmath27 for the same values of @xmath195 the loop can achieve synchronization or not depending on the filter s initial state @xmath8 , the initial phase difference @xmath49 , and @xmath18 .",
