    "dark matter is the dominant gravitationally attractive component of the universe @xcite .",
    "while there is a large set of particle candidates @xcite , we have no idea which of these , if any , constitutes the dark matter ( although there are some things it clearly _ can not _",
    "be , e.g. , light neutrinos @xcite ) . however , arguably the most popular candidate class is `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) .",
    "this class of candidate , which includes both axions @xcite and weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite , is called `` cold '' because it is non - relativistic during major events in the early universe ( freeze - out in the case of wimps , kinetic decoupling for all ) .",
    "this class is popular because it is in many ways the simplest ; dark - matter candidates come `` for free '' in many extensions to the standard model of particle physics , are in the early universe at the right abundance in most models , and thereafter evolve in a way that is consistent with observations of large - scale structure .",
    "however , cdm is not the only viable dark - matter candidate class .",
    "a number of observations on smaller scales have inspired investigations into dark - matter models which reproduce the successes of cdm on large scales ( corresponding approximately to the scales on which @xmath9 galaxies are observed and larger ) while deviating from cdm on the small scales which either lack observations or for which observations are difficult to interpret .",
    "while recent work has focused on finding dark - matter candidates which may boost the light - lepton density throughout the milky way to explain unexpectedly high electron and positron counts @xcite , the classic arena in which to play the non - cold - dark - matter game is the distribution of dark matter in galaxies . in particular , the mismatch between the observed number of satellites of the milky way and the number of massive subhalos predicted in cdm simulations ( coined the `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite ) has inspired a number of models in which either the phase - space density of dark matter is reduced or the small - scale power spectrum is cut off ( or both ) relative to cdm @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a new set of constraints on a class of dark - matter candidate which was originally motivated by the missing - satellites problem and the mass distribution within dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this class of model consists of two nearly degenerate massive dark - matter species @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the masses are related by @xmath12 with @xmath13 . in the simplest scenario",
    ", @xmath10 decays to @xmath11 and a massless particle which need not be a standard - model particle . if @xmath14 is sufficiently small , the @xmath11 particle receives a non - relativistic velocity kick @xmath15 . unlike most decaying - dark - matter models , we consider lifetimes @xmath2 that are comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "previous work has shown that @xmath16 gyr to be consistent with cosmic microwave background observations if @xmath17 is relativistic @xcite , and @xmath18 gyr for @xmath19 in order to remain consistent with the observed galaxy - cluster mass function and the galaxy mass - concentration relation @xcite .",
    "constraints may be tighter if the massless particle belongs to the standard model @xcite , but are so far lacking for @xmath20 in the case that the massless particle decays to neutrinos or does not interact electromagnetically .",
    "we reexamine this model in light of its original context , the observed population of milky way satellite galaxies .",
    "a flurry of work in the past several years has highlighted interesting properties of these galaxies that may shed light on both galaxy evolution on the smallest scales and on the nature of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a number of ultra - faint objects have been found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , which deep photometric and spectroscopic follow - up have shown to be highly dark - matter - dominated galaxies in the milky way halo with a nearly constant amount of dark matter within the inner @xmath21 kpc . in this work , we show which properties of this galaxy population yield robust constraints to the decay parameter space ( @xmath17 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "we use a hybrid method combining semi - analytic dark - matter merger trees and star - formation prescriptions with simulations of decay in isolated dark - matter halos to determine the properties of subhalos and satellite galaxies in a decaying - dark - matter cosmology to allow for a comparison with the currently known satellite population . for the purposes of this work ,",
    "we define `` subhalo '' as any distinct dark - matter clump within a host dark - matter halo , and `` satellite '' as a subhalo that contains stars . in addition",
    ", we will highlight how the uncertainty in the evolution of baryons in low - mass halo complicates inferences about dark - matter properties from milky way satellites .",
    "we show that the resulting constraints on decaying dark matter are complementary to those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper goes as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we describe the method by which we constrain decaying dark matter with milky way satellites , and in sec . [ sec : results ] , we describe the constraints . in that section ,",
    "we explore which properties of the milky way satellites may robustly constrain the decay parameter space , and show how the constraints depend on the star - formation properties of dwarf galaxies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we place our findings in the context of other work .",
    "in this section , we describe the key observational properties of milky way satellites that we will use to constrain decay properties , and introduce the method by which we calculate the effects of decay on satellite populations of milky way - like dark - matter halos .",
    "we describe the observables first because they dictate the requirements for the decay simulations .",
    "as highlighted in the introduction , the number of known milky way satellites has approximately doubled ( with the exact number a moving target ) in the past five years due to the advent of sophisticated color - magnitude filtering techniques to find low surface brightness galaxies in the sdss @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have a number of interesting properties , such as having extremely low luminosities ( segue 1 has @xmath22 ) and being incredibly dark - matter dominated ( again , @xmath23 within the half - light radii ) @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are pressure - supported , and have stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath24 of only a few @xmath25 , significantly smaller on average than the classical milky way dwarf galaxies . to compare these line - of - sight velocities with theoretical predictions for dark - matter halos",
    ", @xmath24 is often converted to an estimated @xmath26 , the maximum circular velocity of the satellite .",
    "below , we will use the relation used by @xcite @xcite , @xmath27 , to compare the @xmath28  of subsets of the subhalos in our simulations to those of real galaxies .",
    "mass - modeling of a subset of classical dwarfs indicates that this relation between @xmath24 and @xmath28  is reasonable @xcite .",
    "another interesting , and related , property of the satellites is the inferred mass enclosed within 300 pc of the galaxy centers , @xmath4 .",
    "several analyses have indicated that this mass is nearly constant among the galaxies ( @xmath29 ) , even though the luminosities span roughly five orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the least luminous spectroscopically confirmed galaxy , segue 1 , has @xmath30 . whether this narrow range of @xmath4 is an artifact of the selection function of dwarf galaxies or a fundamental limit in star - formation physics is a matter of debate @xcite , but in any case , it means that the minimum constraint for a dark - matter model is that it produces at least enough subhalos with @xmath4 in the range matching the observed milky way satellites , within a milky way - mass dark - matter halo .",
    "overshooting the number of satellites above the @xmath4 threshold is all right because it is generally easier to remove mass from the inner part of a halo than it is to add mass .",
    "the third observed property of these satellites which is relevant to this work is that they have stars .",
    "although an obvious point , it highlights the fact that any inference about dark matter from the milky way satellite population depends on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "some authors have estimated the luminosity function for the full population of milky way satellites ( taking into account sdss sky coverage and completeness ) @xcite , and used that to test cold or warm dark matter paradigms @xcite .",
    "we refrain from using the luminosity function to constrain the decay model because it is highly sensitive to the poorly understood star - formation and feedback processes of small galaxies .",
    "instead , we simply consider the fact that the observed satellites necessarily contain stars .    in summary ,",
    "there are three observed or inferred properties of the currently known population of milky way satellite galaxies that we use to constrain the decaying dark matter scenario : @xmath28 , @xmath4 , and the presence of stars .",
    "in addition , we know how many satellite galaxies are currently known , and one can estimate the total number of satellite galaxies with properties similar to known satellites by taking into account the sky coverage of sdss and its selection function @xcite .",
    "we discuss the details and subtleties of comparing these properties to the simulated properties of satellites in a decaying - dark - matter cosmology in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .      in order to constrain @xmath1  and @xmath2",
    ", we study the @xmath28 , @xmath4 , and stellar properties of subhalos and satellites for an ensemble of milky way - mass halos .",
    "we want to explore an ensemble of milky way - mass halos for each point in @xmath1@xmath31 space in order to get a sense of how likely or unlikely it is for the observed satellite population to resemble the simulated population . in light of this goal and the properties of the simulated subhalo and satellite populations we use to compare with observations ,",
    "we construct a hybrid technique involving both semi - analytic modeling and @xmath32-body simulations to explore the effects of decay on subhalos and satellite galaxies of milky way - mass dark - matter halos .",
    "the fact that we are interested in long ( @xmath33 gyr ) decay times and non - relativistic @xmath1  allows us to use cdm initial conditions for our hybrid decay simulator .",
    "we use merger trees from the galacticus semi - analytic model , which are simulated in @xmath34cdm cosmologies , and use prescriptions within galacticus to determine the density profiles of the dark - matter halos and subhalos in the absence of decay @xcite .",
    "the relevant properties of galacticus for this work are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : merger ] .",
    "we use simulations of decay in isolated dark - matter halos to take into account the effects of decay on individual subhalos in the merger trees , as described further in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : simulations ] .",
    "we populate subhalos with stars according to the prescription in sec . [",
    "sec : methods : star ] .",
    "this method is much faster to implement and in many ways more robust than using cosmological @xmath32-body simulations alone , which at first glance would have been the obvious path to take .",
    "cosmological @xmath32-body simulations , even zoomed on a particular host halo , have major disadvantages .",
    "first , even the highest - resolution simulations of milky way - mass halos can only probe down to a few hundred parsecs of the center of the main halo potential @xcite .",
    "however , while resolution tests exist for main halo centers , systematic resolution tests on subhalos are lacking .",
    "this is a problem if we want to probe the mass within subhalos on scales comparable to the demonstrated resolution limit on the host halo .",
    "however , in setting the subhalo properties in the merger tree , we do use relations among halo properties that are calibrated on large @xmath32-body simulations and in ranges of mass or redshift that have not been tested by simulations .",
    "second , each realization of a milky way - mass halo at the present best resolution takes months of supercomputing time to run . since we want to explore a range of @xmath1   and @xmath2 , and to simulate an ensemble of milky way - mass halos for each set of @xmath1  and @xmath2 , cosmological simulations are highly impractical .",
    "distributions of dark matter subhalo properties at @xmath35 were computed using the galacticus semi - analytic code of galacticus was used .",
    "the galacticus model can be downloaded from http://sites.google.com/site/galacticusmodel .",
    "the input parameter file used for these calculations is available at http://www.ctcp.caltech.edu/galacticus/parameters/parameters_v0.0.1.xml[http://www.ctcp.caltech.edu/galacticus/parameters/darkmatterdecays.xml ] . ]",
    "@xcite . only dark sector physics ( dark matter merger tree construction and subhalo orbital decay via dynamical friction )",
    "was included in these calculations  all baryonic physics in galacticus was switched off .",
    "dark matter merger trees were built using the algorithm described by ref .",
    "standard values of the accuracy parameters for this algorithm were used as follows :    ` [ mergertreebuildcole2000mergeprobability]`@xmath36 : : :    the maximum probability for a binary merger allowed in a single time    step .",
    "this ensures that the probability is kept small , such the the    probability for multiple mergers within a single time step is small ; ` [ mergertreebuildcole2000accretionlimit]`@xmath36 : : :    the maximum fractional change in mass due to sub - resolution accretion    allowed in any given time step when building the tree .",
    "merger trees were resolved down to halos of mass @xmath37 .",
    "mass accretion below this scale was treated as smooth accretion and branches were truncated once they fell below this mass .    branching probabilities in the merger tree",
    "were computed using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 of their algorithm were set to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively as recommended by @xcite .",
    "additionally , the parameter ` [ modifiedpressschechterfirstorderaccuracy ] ` in galacticus was set to @xmath44 to limit the step taken in the critical linear theory overdensity for collapse in the merger tree building algorithm .",
    "this step was not allowed to exceed ` [ modifiedpressschechterfirstorderaccuracy ] ` times @xmath45}$ ] , where @xmath46 is the mass of the halo being considered for branching and @xmath47 is the cdm mass variance computed by filtering the power spectrum using top - hat spheres .",
    "this ensures that the first order expansion of the merging rate that is assumed in the tree building algorithm is accurate .",
    "progenitor halo mass functions from merger trees built using this algorithm have been compared with equivalent progenitor mass functions measured from the millennium simulation @xcite and show excellent agreement with the n - body result @xcite .",
    "the galacticus code evolves the merging distribution of halos forward in time .",
    "when one halo merges with another , larger halo it becomes a subhalo within that larger host .",
    "we track only a single level hierarchy of substructure , i.e. we track only substructures , not sub - substructures or deeper levels or the merging hierarchy .",
    "therefore , if a merging halo contains its own subhalos they will become independent subhalos within the new host and will be assigned new merging times ( see below ) .",
    "once a halo becomes a subhalo it is assigned a timescale for merging to the center of its host halo due to the actions of dynamical friction .",
    "we use the dynamical friction calibration of @xcite to compute dynamical friction timescales , with orbital parameters of subhalos selected at random from the cosmological distribution found by @xcite .",
    "once this timescale for merging has elapsed the subhalo is merged into its host and no longer exists as an independent entity",
    ".    the properties of the subhalos , including the density profile and the mass , are set at accretion time .",
    "the radius at which the slope of the density profile @xmath48 relative to the virial radius @xmath49 , defining the concentration parameter @xmath50 is set according to @xcite , which is calibrated using the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the subhalo mass and virial radius at accretion are set according to the virial overdensity criterion of @xcite for homogeneous dark - energy cdm cosmologies .",
    "there are a few caveats to applying these particular options for the merger tree .",
    "first , the merger tree and , for example , the mass - concentration relation as a function of redshift have been tested on a small set of simulations representing a limited set of cosmological parameters and range of halo mass .",
    "for example , the redshift - dependent concentration and the merger histories have been calibrated using the millennium simulation , which has a relatively high @xmath51 , and for which the dark - matter particle mass is @xmath52 ( larger than many of the subhalos in our merger trees ) @xcite .",
    "others have found that the mass - concentration relation depends on a number of cosmological parameters , in particular @xmath53 , and the redshift - evolution of this relation is still under debate @xcite .",
    "moreover , this relation has not been tested in the mass and redshift ranges of some of the subhalos before they merge onto a larger halo .",
    "the main way we mitigate some of these uncertainties is to impose a minimum cut - off in the concentration .",
    "studies have shown that @xmath54 at virialization , so we assign high - redshift halos @xmath55 if the @xcite formula indicates @xmath56 below that value @xcite . in addition , there is a great deal of scatter in the mass - concentration even in the mass and redshift range in which it has been studied .",
    "the dynamical friction formula has been determined using a set of n - body cosmological simulations , and also not necessarily on the small and early scales that are relevant to this work @xcite .",
    "finally , the merger tree does not include the effects of tidal stripping .",
    "tidal stripping not only destroys some subhalos , but also may reduce @xmath28  and @xmath4 of the remaining subhalos .",
    "the important implication of this fact for this work is that our constraints are quite conservative , as we use the subhalo properties at the time of accretion .      in order to estimate the effects of decay on the subhalo population and the host halos",
    ", we use a set of simulations of isolated , initially equilibrium cdm halos .",
    "the first set of simulations we use , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , were initially presented in @xcite .",
    "the halos in these simulations had initial virial mass @xmath59 , with the virial overdensity defined in ref .",
    "there were 25 sets of simulations , scanning decay parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and 100 gyr , where @xmath63  is the virial velocity of the halo .",
    "for this work , we simulated @xmath64 halos with one million particles each of mass @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the same sets of @xmath68 and @xmath2 in order to span a broad range of subhalo concentrations .",
    "we simulated these halos using a modified version of gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we assumed a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile for the initial matter distribution within the virial radius @xmath49  of the halo @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the scale density , and @xmath71 is the scale radius . at the level of numerical resolution in our simulations , this density profile is nearly indistinguishable from the now - preferred einasto profile @xcite .",
    "all other aspects of the simulation , from the set - up of the initial conditions to the simulation and cosmological parameters , is identical to that in @xcite .    to apply these simulations to the subhalos of the merger trees , as well as to the host halos , we use the following strategy . to characterize the subhalos",
    ", we use @xmath72 and @xmath73 at the time of accretion , and find the mass and concentration of these subhalos at @xmath35 assuming that the only growth to the subhalos comes from the decrease in the global mass density of the universe as a function of time .",
    "this sets the @xmath35 concentration parameter and virial mass , and we estimate the effects of decay using these properties . we characterize the isolated decay simulations by five parameters : @xmath68 , which relates the recoil speed to the typical speed of particles in the halo ( and hence , the escape velocity ) ; @xmath56 , which characterizes the depth of the potential well in addition to the typical dynamical time scale of particles within the halo ( since the dynamical time at the half - mass radius depends only on @xmath56 ) ; the decay time scale @xmath2 ; @xmath74 , the radius at which we sample the mass profile of the halo as a function of the virial radius ; and time @xmath75 .",
    "we divide the mass profile by the initial virial mass in the simulation , and we cut off the mass profile at @xmath76 since we have found that numerical relaxation becomes a problem for smaller radii . for a given subhalo with specific @xmath35 properties",
    ", we find the subhalo mass profile by interpolating the simulations in the log - space of @xmath68 , @xmath56 , @xmath2 , and @xmath75 .",
    "we use the mass profile to determine @xmath4 and @xmath28   at @xmath35 , and @xmath28  at the accretion time ( since this determines whether or not the subhalo has stars , as will be described below ) .",
    "we also apply the decay interpolation to the host halos , since decays can obviously change the mass of the host as well as the subhalos .",
    "this is important for the host mass cut we employ in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "this provides a conservative estimate of the effects of decay on the subhalos since the interplay between decay and tidal forces are likely to reduce @xmath28  and @xmath4 even more than if the subhalos were isolated halos .",
    "since we only care if a subhalo has stars at all , a crude model for populating halos with stars is acceptable .",
    "if a halo is accreted onto a larger halo prior to reionization , the halo is allowed to have stars if its maximum circular velocity at accretion @xmath77 , which is approximately the lowest threshold at which gas may accrete onto halos and cool via collisional interactions with molecular hydrogen @xcite . during and after reionization",
    ", star formation is suppressed in low - mass halos due to various effects related to the strong ionizing background radiation @xcite . to model these effects ,",
    "we allow halos with @xmath78 at accretion onto a larger halo after reionization to host stars ; those with smaller @xmath28  are not allowed to host stars .",
    "though this step - function treatment of stellar content in halos is crude , it captures the essence of the fact that star formation in halos depends on reionization and that the stellar content of a subhalo depends on its accretion history .",
    "this model for populating halos with stars is similar to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "for each set of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , we selected @xmath79 host halos with virial masses in the range @xmath80 , since this appears to be the plausible range of mass for the milky way halo ( although most estimates favor the higher end of this range ) @xcite .",
    "we have checked the results in this section for dependence on the merger history .",
    "specifically , simulations suggest that the milky way disk could not have withstood a 10:1 merger since @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we found that the results from the entire host - halo population were indistinguishable from those from the sample of hosts selected to have not had a major merger since @xmath82 .    in this study , we consider several subsets of the subhalo populations .",
    "the first sample we call the `` all nodes '' sample , as it represents all nodes of the merger tree down to the mass resolution of @xmath83 .",
    "this is the most conservative subhalo sample to use to constrain @xmath84 parameter space because we ignore dynamical friction and we characterize the subhalos by their properties at the moment they are accreted onto larger halos .",
    "the second subset of subhalos we use is the `` dynamical friction '' sample .",
    "this contains all subhalos in the merger tree that do not sink to the center of larger halos by dynamical friction .",
    "the survival probability is calculated according to ref .",
    "@xcite and is the default setting of galacticus @xcite .",
    "the mass profile of these subhalos varies continuously prior to when they first become a subhalo ( in either the main branch of the merger tree or a sub - branch ) . after that time",
    ", their mass profile remains fixed . using this sample",
    "to set constraints is less conservative than using the `` all nodes '' sample because it is not completely clear how decays will affect dynamical friction ; on one hand , decays decrease the mass of both the subhalo and host ( although the effect on the former is stronger than on the latter ) , reducing the effectiveness of dynamical friction ; on the other hand , the binding energy of the subhalo decreases , making it easier to shred ( although this effect is not modeled in galacticus for cdm halos ) .    the differences in the cdm properties of these two populations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vhist_cdm ] .",
    "we show these properties for cdm because they will influence the properties of the `` all nodes '' and `` dynamical friction '' populations once we turn on the decays .",
    "what we show in this figure is the velocity function , the number of subhalos above a maximum circular velocity @xmath28 , @xmath85 , for both the `` all nodes '' sample ( left ) and `` dynamical friction '' sample , with the error bars showing the 25% and 75% percentiles of the number of subhalos in the host halos . the percentiles should be taken as an indication of the range of @xmath28  and not interpreted strictly as errors because we have chosen an initial host population with masses drawn uniformly from the range @xmath86@xmath87 instead of choosing the host masses according to a probability distribution from existing data on the milky way host mass .",
    "these merger trees were generated for a flat @xmath34cdm cosmology with @xmath51 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "note that since the velocity function is a cumulative function , the percentile bars are highly correlated . also on the plots",
    "are the velocity function of known milky way satellites , corrected for sdss sky coverage ( dotted line connecting data points ) @xcite , and the velocity function from two different high - resolution cdm simulations of milky way - mass dark - matter halos ( thin solid lines ) .",
    "the upper thin line represents the velocity function found in the high - resolution aquarius a simulation of a @xmath90 halo with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath51 cosmology @xcite .",
    "the lower thin line shows the velocity function of the via lactea ii halo , which has a similar virial mass as the aquarius a halo but is simulated in a cosmology with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this velocity function has a lower normalization because the cosmological parameters used tend to produce fewer and less dense subhalos than the ones employed by the aquarius collaboration .",
    "the velocity functions in the cdm simulations lie below those of our merger trees because the simulations necessarily take into account tidal stripping .",
    "tidal stripping tends to lower @xmath28  after accretion , and @xcite shows that the velocity function of @xmath28  at accretion has approximately a factor of five higher normalization than the velocity function for which stripping is taken into account , for @xmath96 .",
    "it is apparent that velocity function of the `` dynamical friction '' sample has both an overall normalization lower than that of the `` all nodes sample '' , and that the slope is substantially steeper .",
    "this is to be expected , as dynamical friction is more efficient for higher - mass ( and hence , in general , higher @xmath28 ) subhalos .",
    "thus , in the case of cdm , we find that the `` all nodes '' sample contains both more and on average more massive subhalos .",
    "moreover , given the factor of @xmath97 difference in normalization for the velocity function for @xmath28  at accretion versus @xmath28  at @xmath35 with tidal stripping included , the `` dynamical friction '' sample is a somewhat better match to the velocity function of the two high - resolution cdm simulations , taking into account differences in underlying cosmologies and host halo masses @xcite .    within each of the `` all nodes '' and `` dynamical friction '' subhalo samples , we determine two different possible satellite populations : a @xmath98 satellite sample consisting of all subhalos satisfying the star - formation criterion for @xmath98 given in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : star ] , and a @xmath99 satellite sample consisting of subhalos satisfying that criterion at a reionization redshift @xmath99 .",
    "we choose the @xmath99 reionization redshift because wmap seven - year data suggest that the universe was reionized at @xmath100 @xcite . however , reionization is ultimately a time- and location - dependent process .",
    "other work has indicated that the milky way - associated region could have been reionized as late as @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "our first constraint on @xmath1  and @xmath2 comes from considering the number of simulated satellites above an @xmath4 threshold @xmath102 .",
    "this threshold for observed satellites is apparent in @xcite . to estimate the true number of milky way satellites above this threshold from the observed satellite population , we extend the work of @xcite @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors use the sky coverage and selection function of sdss as well as the subhalo distribution in the via lactea simulation @xcite to estimate the number of satellite galaxies out to the virial radius ( @xmath103 kpc for the via lactea halo , @xmath104 ) .",
    "they found that there should be , on average , 382 satellites n the milky way within that virial radius , and a 98% probability that there would be at least 292 .",
    "since we consider the possibility that the milky way halo could be up to a factor of four less massive ( remaining consistent with published estimates of the milky way halo mass ) , we must adjust the @xcite results to find the minimum number of satellites within the milky way virial radius .",
    "we do this by considering the radial distribution of the via lactea subhalos , rescaling the distribution by the virial radius . we find that for possible milky way halo masses @xmath105 , we expect at least @xmath106 satellites within the milky way virial radius .",
    "this lower bound is somewhat rough , as we do not do a full recalculation of @xcite but instead estimate the average difference in the parameter @xmath107 ( defined in @xcite ) between a virial mass @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "as long as the radial distribution of subhalos is relatively insensitive to host halo mass , and as long as the radial distribution is not a strong function of decay , this approach should yield an approximately correct estimated minimum number of satellites .    in order to set conservative limits on @xmath84 space , we create merger trees with @xmath51 , which is slightly above the 2@xmath110 upper limit from the wmap seven - year data set @xcite .",
    "we choose a high @xmath53 because structures form earlier and have higher densities for high @xmath53 .",

    "[ fig : dndm300 ] , and what is especially striking is the high-@xmath4 tail of the `` all nodes '' samples which extend to far higher @xmath4 than the `` dynamical friction '' or observed satellite samples .",
    "in addition , one effect we have not modeled is tidal stripping .",
    "while 300 pc is typically deep within a satellite or subhalo , the mass within that radius may be reduced as a consequence of tidal stripping , as high - apocenter orbits are progressively removed from the center . however ,",
    "if @xmath4 were to be significantly affected by tidal stripping , the associated stellar population should also look significantly disturbed , unless the dark - matter orbits are , on average , highly radial .",
    "although we hypothesize that the `` dynamical friction '' samples are more likely to represent reality than the `` all nodes '' samples , the shape of the @xmath4 mass function will still depend on the physics of star formation and tidal stripping .",
    "the latter can in principle be modeled using cosmological @xmath32-body simulations , but would require extremely high resolution .",
    "there are a few things that are likely to be robust to these effects .",
    "the first is the upper @xmath4 tail of the mass function , since while it is possible to remove mass from inside 300 pc in a halo , it is hard to add mass if there are also only negligible amounts of baryons in the halo ( which might have compressed the dark - matter mass profile ) .",

    "we found that the velocity function of satellites and the @xmath4 values of the classical dwarfs provide similar constraints for @xmath131 , which is because decays only affect the largest subhalos for such @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath99 `` dynamical friction '' sample , the velocity function more strongly constrains the decay space than the number of satellites above the @xmath4 threshold , the mass - concentration relation , or the galaxy - cluster mass function .",
    "the limits we set in figs .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] and [ fig : vmax_exclusion ] are quite conservative because we use merger trees with high @xmath53 and we use the subhalo properties at accretion to determine @xmath28  and @xmath4 at @xmath35 .",

    "conversely , one can think of the @xmath4 distribution as a way to probe star - formation physics as well as dark - matter physics .",
    "in addition , tidal stripping can potentially lower @xmath4 , although typically 300 pc is smaller than the radius at which the circular velocity curve of subhalos peaks , making @xmath4 likely a more constant property of a subhalo over its lifetime than @xmath28 .",

    ", @xmath4 provides a cleaner and potentially more powerful probe of dark - matter properties than @xmath28  because @xmath28  typically occurs at larger radii than 300 pc , at least for cdm cosmologies .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 probes the innermost mass of the satellite galaxies is interesting for dark - matter theories that are alternatives to cdm .",
    "all non - cdm theories invoke energy injection or transfer into the dark - matter population by decays ( e.g. , @xcite ) or by introducing a non - trivial collision term into the dark - matter boltzmann equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath147 is enormous for cdm , but becomes is modest once decays or collisions are turned on .",
    "the problem with trying to infer @xmath147 from data is that @xmath147 depends on the velocity structure of dark matter , which can never be directly measured ( although it may be indirectly measured if , for example , the annihilation cross section is velocity - dependent ) .",
    "specific non - cdm theories predict relations between @xmath147 and the dark - matter density profile , but one must analyze the data in the context of that specific model @xcite . while this is useful to constrain specific theories , one can not generically determine if the observations deviate cdm on the basis of @xmath147 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath4 to characterize the dark - matter halos , and using that to consider deviations from cdm , is that any non - cdm dark - matter theory implies that @xmath4 is lower than the cdm value . due to the negative heat capacity of self - gravitating halos , kinetic energy injection or collision terms",
    "tend to reduce the central density of the halos ( at least until core - collapse , in the case of collision terms ) .",
    "thus , any physics that would reduce @xmath147 would also reduce @xmath4 . since 300 pc is typically deep within the halo",
    ", it could be a good probe of dark - matter properties .",
    "the inferred property of the dark content of milky way satellites that has the smallest errors is the mass within the half - light radius of the stars , @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the half - light radius is often smaller than 300 pc ( e.g. , @xmath79 pc for coma berenices",
    "@xcite ) , although it is often larger , especially for the classical dwarfs . however , the small value of the half - light radius for some of the dwarfs is actually beneficial in constraining the nature of dark matter , since one is measuring the mass within a tiny radius centered on the potential minimum of the halo .",
    "if the @xmath4 mass function is to be a useful probe of either dark - matter physics or galaxy evolution , it is necessary to see how much @xmath4 is affected by the dynamics of subhalos inside the host halos . however , if this is possible to determine , then in principle , the @xmath4 mass function or the @xmath149 mass function of satellites should provide an interesting window into dark - matter properties .",
