    "images collected with ground based telescopes show temporal variation in image quality , primarily due to fluctuations in the index of refraction of the air along the light path .",
    "these index of refraction fluctuations are caused by differences in air temperature arising from turbulent mixing .",
    "these turbulent motions happen on smaller scales than the gross motions of the winds .",
    "still it is known that the wind has a part in the strength of these fluctuations .",
    "hufnagel @xcite derived a model for the vertical profile of strength of turbulence @xmath7 which depended on a wind speed profile centered at a particular altitude .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that the index of refraction fluctuations are enhanced where there are shears in winds @xcite , so that direction as well as speed can be a factor , although this is difficult to quantify @xcite .    aside from the effects of wind on turbulence strength ,",
    "the movement of turbulent regions past an observer induces temporal variations in seeing .",
    "if wind speeds are sufficiently high that turbulence does not evolve significantly over a measurement period , we apply taylor s hypothesis and treat the temperature fluctuations as quantities that are advected by the wind @xcite .    the following wind model is often used in the modeling of adaptive optics and other imaging systems ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) ,    @xmath8 ^ 2\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the wind speed in m / s , @xmath10 is the height in m , and @xmath11 is the angle from the zenith .",
    "bufton @xcite is often cited as the source for this model ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but that paper does not present an explicit wind model .",
    "the basic form of the model was presented by greenwood @xcite .",
    "readers often over look the statement in the body of the original paper that the height @xmath12 corresponds to a mean sea level altitude of 3048 m. this is the height of the maui space surveillance system on haleakala , where the analysis was being used .",
    "so the height of the tropopause term , 9400 m , should really be 12448 m when the model is used for sites other than haleakala .",
    "this caveat has been overlooked in a number of references , leading to misleading results .    the model from greenwood @xcite",
    "was derived by averaging radiosonde data collected from balloons launched from lihue on the island of kauai from 1950 - 1970 and from hilo on the island of hawaii from 1950 - 1974 .",
    "this was more fully detailed in a technical report , which did not explicitly generalize the equation , but the authors clearly understood what the various terms signified @xcite .",
    "the wind model is generalized as ,    @xmath13 ^ 2\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the wind speed , @xmath10 is the altitude , @xmath15 is the wind speed at the ground or low altitude , @xmath16 is the wind speed at tropopause , @xmath17 is the altitude of the tropopause , @xmath18 is the thickness of the tropopause layer and @xmath19 is the zenith angle of the observation @xcite .",
    "there are several uses for a wind profile .",
    "it can be used in conjunction with a turbulence model to predict the performance of instrumentation .",
    "most commonly this is applied to the servo bandwidth of closed loop systems @xcite .",
    "the minimum bandwidth of the system ( to limit servo lag ) is related to the greenwood frequency . because the greenwood frequency depends on a product of @xmath4 and a power of the wind speed @xmath20 , it is important to get the wind profile and turbulence profiles as a function of altitude .",
    "a wind profile can also be used to simulate turbulence in conjunction with phase screens .",
    "currently , there is an increased emphasis on modeling effects of turbulence on telescopes with diameters of 20 - 50 meters .",
    "significantly more spatial variation of wavefront optical path difference is captured with such large telescopes in a short exposure than on a smaller telescope .",
    "some of that variation is due to the presence of multiple layers of turbulence , moving at different speeds and in different directions .",
    "the patterns may not simply translate across the telescope aperture as implied by the taylor hypothesis , but are more likely toboil \" with a complicated wind profile .",
    "this can have an impact on the design and performance of an adaptive optics system .    in order to",
    "better model atmospheric turbulence , we used archival radiosonde data to compute the wind profiles for a number of astronomical observatories . we also show that the wind profile has a strong seasonal variation .",
    "we also extend the wind profiles , by including wind direction .",
    "unfortunately , the wind directions do not always lend themselves to an analytic expression , so we only show them in graphs .    using the same radiosonde data",
    ", we examined the variation of the gradient richardson number @xcite ) , which is an indicator of the stability of parcels of air .",
    "since it depends upon strength of wind shear , as opposed to wind speed , it also serves to inform the modeler that wind speed alone is not sufficient .",
    "as will be seen in our plots , the wind speed can be modeled with a few simple terms , but the form of the richardson number plots indicates the true nature of atmospheric turbulence : layered , with sharp boundaries ( although these are muted by the resolution of our data ) .",
    "worldwide there are over 900 sites that launch radiosondes on a routine basis .",
    "radiosondes are small instrument packages mounted on weather balloons .",
    "they record atmospheric pressure , temperature , potential temperature , mixing ratio , dew point , and relative humidity as a function of height .",
    "data are taken at about 6 second intervals , but databases may only have the data recorded at 60 second intervals .",
    "readings at certain specific standard barometric pressures are made regardless of when they occur .",
    "since the balloons rise at about 5 m / s , the best vertical resolution would be approximately 30 meters , while the usual recorded resolution would be 300 meters and frequently the recorded data are at irregular intervals .",
    "wind speed and wind direction are obtained from either radar observation or a navigation system such as long range navigation ( loran ) and newer systems may use the global positioning system .",

    "note that the reversal of wind direction at altitudes above 20 km is a well known feature of the zonal wind flow .",
    "it is due to a higher altitude jet whose center is north of the equator in winter , and south of the equator in summer .",

    "small differences in altitudes and location can alter the observed seeing significantly @xcite .    while the richardson number does not indicate the strength of turbulence , knowing that there are persistent turbulent layers may be useful to site planners .",
    "for example , knowing roughly where and when one might expect upper layers of turbulence to be present could be useful for measurements , such as laser communications , which are strongly influenced by scintillation .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that some layers closer to the ground have @xmath24<0.25 .",
    "these must also be persistent to show up over the averaging .",
