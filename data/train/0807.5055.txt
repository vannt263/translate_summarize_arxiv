    "the advent of new and high statistics deeply inelastic neutrino scattering experiments apart from providing valuable data on @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite has shown again the importance of nuclear effects that render difficult the extraction of the nucleon structure functions .",
    "furthermore , the use of nuclear targets is necessary due to the smallness of the cross sections .",
    "qualitatively , the nuclear effects are well known .",
    "shadowing , antishadowing , fermi motion , binding , ... have all been widely studied for charged leptons in the context of the european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is well known that nuclear effects are substantially different for neutrino reactions due to the presence of the axial current and the different valence and sea quark contributions for each observable  @xcite .",
    "this situation asks for a detailed and quantitative microscopical understanding of the nuclear effects , rather than the parametrizations that have been used sometimes , like recently by the nutev collaboration  @xcite .",
    "one of the basic ingredients in all calculations is the nuclear spectral function .",
    "this presents some serious difficulties , as these functions are not so well known to the precision level reached by current experiments .",
    "therefore , the analysis might introduce unwanted model dependences .",
    "however , it was soon noticed that under some approximations the nuclear structure functions could be written as simple expansions on the nucleon structure functions and their derivatives .",
    "all the nuclear information would then be encoded in the expected values of some nuclear magnitudes , like the average kinetic energy of the nucleons or the mean nucleon removal energy .",
    "these kind of approximations , both for charged lepton and for neutrino induced reactions , have been widely used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the quality of these expansions and to what extent they could be used in the analysis of lepton deep inelastic scattering experiments . in order to do that ,",
    "once the formalism is established in the next section , we will make a comparative study for @xmath3 and for a few typical nuclear spectral functions used in the literature .",
    "the nuclear structure functions can be written as a convolution of the nuclear spectral functions and nucleon structure functions .",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein . in the rest frame of the nucleus ,",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath4 structure functions are @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nuclear spectral function , normalized to the number of protons ( neutrons ) in the nucleus , and describes the probability of finding a proton ( neutron ) with momentum @xmath7 and removal energy @xmath8 .",
    "the four - momentum of the nucleon can be written as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the _ z _ axis is oriented in such a way that @xmath11 lies on it , @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of the nucleon and @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the natural bjorken variable for the nucleon in the nuclear medium , i.e. @xmath15 ; while @xmath0 is the bjorken variable in the nucleon rest frame , @xmath16 .",
    "they are related by @xmath17    for isoscalar nuclei such as @xmath18 , only the isoscalar component of the spectral function and the structure function have to be accounted for . when this is done ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) ,",
    "these read as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , which is the isoscalar part of the nuclear spectral function , is now normalized to unity and we perform the calculations for the nuclear structure functions averaged over neutrinos and antineutrinos , i.e. , we only consider the symmetric @xmath21 combination  @xcite .    in a nucleus",
    ", the expected values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 averaged with the nuclear spectral function are much smaller than unity .",
    "thus , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . under these assumptions",
    ", we can perform a taylor expansion of the integrands in expressions ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) around @xmath26 , keeping terms up to order @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this way we will be able to take out of the integral the structure functions and their derivatives and",
    "we will be left with expected values of the removal energy @xmath8 and momentum squared @xmath29 .",
    "this statement is true if the nuclear spectral functions only depend on the modulus of the momentum @xmath30 ( as it is in the case of the nuclear spectral functions we will consider ) and not upon its direction . under this assumption",
    "we can drop the expected values of @xmath31 ( or any other component of the momentum ) and @xmath32 because they are identically zero due to symmetry considerations .",
    "we will begin with the structure function @xmath33 .",
    "after performing the taylor expansion , keeping terms up to order @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and dropping those terms which go with @xmath34 or @xmath35 ( because they are identically zero as stated above ) , we obtain @xmath36 -x\\frac{\\partial f_2^n\\left ( x , q^2\\right ) } { \\partial x}\\left [ \\frac{\\left\\langle \\epsilon\\right\\rangle } { m}+\\left ( 2-\\gamma^2\\right)\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{p}^2\\right\\rangle } { 3m^2 } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   \\fl & + & \\left ( x\\frac{\\partial f_2^n\\left ( x , q^2\\right ) } { \\partial x}+\\frac{x^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2f_2^n\\left ( x , q^2\\right ) } { \\partial x^2}\\right ) \\gamma^2\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{p}^2\\right\\rangle } { 3m^2}\\label{eq:6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the expected value of the operator @xmath38 averaged with the isoscalar spectral function @xmath20 : @xmath39 we have also used the fact that , with a nuclear spectral function which depends only on the modulus of the momentum , the expected value of momentum squared is shared equally among every squared component , i.e : @xmath40 . in the bjorken limit , ( @xmath41 ) , ( [ eq:6 ] ) coincides with the expansions used by frankfurt _",
    "_ @xcite and ciofi degli atti _",
    ".    if we do the same for the nuclear structure function @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43+\\gamma^2\\left [ x\\,\\frac{\\partial f_3^n}{\\partial x}+\\frac{x^2}{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2f_3^n}{\\partial x^2}\\right ]    \\right\\rbrace \\label{eq:9},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar result to that kulagin  @xcite . to allow for an easier comparison , in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath44 can be rewritten as @xmath45 then , the only difference between ( [ eq:9 ] ) and that of @xcite is that , for simplicity , we do not consider the off - shell dependence in the nucleon structure function @xmath46 . in our calculation , the only source of off - shell dependence is through the nuclear spectral function @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we do not have the term @xmath48 that appears in @xcite .    for our study",
    "we have selected the @xmath18 nucleus , which is isoscalar and already will show important medium effects .",
    "the free nucleon structure functions have been taken from @xcite and we have chosen several different nuclear spectral functions .",
    "the first one ( labelled i ) is a phenomenological model of the spectral function which has a mean field part and high - momentum components coming from nn - correlations and it is described in kulagin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where it was used in a global study of nuclear structure functions .",
    "the second one ( labelled ii ) , that also contains correlations is taken from @xcite where it has been tested in the calculation of several electron scattering observables .",
    "the third spectral function is taken from the semiphenomenological model based on a many body calculation and the local density approximation that is described in @xcite ( labelled iii ) .",
    "finally , we also consider the simple mean field spectral function of @xcite(labelled iv ) , which was used in the study of the emc effect .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] , we show the results of the ratio @xmath49 for the nuclear spectral functions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "this gives us some idea of the uncertainties related to these functions .",
    "the differences are small , even when the spectral funtions have been obtained with diverse methods and are in fact quite different if one studies in detail their energy and momentum dependence",
    ". however ,        .expected values of the nucleon removal and kinetic energies for the nuclear spectral functions of kulagin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( i ) , ankowski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( ii ) and fernandez de cordoba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( iii ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , spectral functions ( i ) and ( iii ) that have quite close expected values also produce very similar ratios , whereas ( ii ) which has an appreciably smaller binding energy gives slightly larger values for the ratio .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", we compare the full results for the same ratio ( [ eq:4 ] ) whith those obtained making use of the approximation of ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the use of this expansion has been assumed to be a good approximation for @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the series expansion agrees well at low values of @xmath0 with the full results .",
    "however , in the three cases produces lower values for the ratio at intermediate @xmath0 showing a maximum deviation of a 3 - 4@xmath54 around @xmath55 .",
    "this region , with a dip in the ratio , is dominated by the mean removal energy ( or equivalently the binding energy ) per nucleon .",
    "although this could look a small error , we should remark that it means increasing the deviation due to nuclear effects from the value @xmath56 by around a 30% . at higher @xmath0 s , where fermi motion of the nucleons provides the dominant effect , the series expansions grow faster than the full results and",
    "become larger for @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we find that for typical nuclear spectral functions the convergence of the series expansion is not so good except at very low @xmath0 , where in any case other effects not considered here , like shadowing play a major role .",
    "the results for the @xmath58 ratio are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . the full model for @xmath59 is given by ( [ eq:5 ] ) and the series expansion by ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "as it was the case for @xmath60 , there is a dip region dominated by the binding energy and the fermi motion of the nucleons produces the large rising at high values of @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison of the full results and the series expansions shows the same features as for @xmath60 .",
    "the expansions systematically underestimate the ratios at intermediate values of @xmath0 and overestimate them for @xmath61 .",
    "this overestimation of the effect of the fermi motion was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "there , it was also claimed that in the limit of high @xmath62 and for heavy nuclei the expansion should be a good approxiamtion up to @xmath63 .",
    "however , after studying @xmath60 and @xmath59 at different @xmath62 values , apart from the one shown in this paper , we have found that for medium nuclei the convergence of the series is only good at very low @xmath0 where other nuclear effects are very relevant .    in order to obtain a better convergence one would need to reach a higher order in the expansions .",
    "this implies also the sensitivity to nuclear expected values of higher powers of the nucleons momenta as @xmath64 .",
    "one should notice that due to correlations these expected values are not negligible  @xcite .",
    "the three spectral functions considered above contain high momentum components and one may expect any expansion up to order @xmath65 to fail to have a good convergence .",
    "to test this point , we have also calculated @xmath60 for the case of a simpler mean field spectral function which does not incorporate nucleon correlations and does not have those high momentum components  @xcite .",
    "this function was used to analyse the a dependence of the position and magnitude of the dip . here",
    ", we have used the same parton distribution functions as in the original reference  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . in this case",
    ", there is an almost perfect agreement between the full results and the expansion .    in summary , we have studied the quality of some series expansions commonly used to incorporate approximately the nuclear effects in the analysis of dis processes .",
    "we have found that for realistic enough nuclear spectral functions , that include nucleon correlations and have high momentum components , the convergence of the series to the full result is poor except at very low values of @xmath0 , where in fact , other nuclear effects , like shadowing or antishadowing , are more relevant . at high @xmath0 values , in the fermi motion region ,",
    "the expansions clearly overestimate the full result .",
    "this was known and expected . however , even at relatively low @xmath0 values , where the expansions were suppossed to provide a good approximation , we have found that they systematically underestimate the value of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , artificially increasing the size of the nuclear corrections .",
