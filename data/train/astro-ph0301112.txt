    "although there has been much recent interest in shear modes of neutron star oscillation ( blaes et al 1989 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ; duncan 1998 ) , relatively little attention has been paid to the associated damping mechanisms apart from coupling with magnetospheric alfvn waves .",
    "blaes et al consider that stress - induced motion of dislocations may be an important process , as is believed to be the case for shear waves in the earth .",
    "but nothing is known about the distribution of linear and planar defects in the lattice of nuclei at matter densities @xmath3 below the neutron - drip theshold @xmath4 g @xmath5 or about their stress - induced mobility . at densities in the crust above @xmath6 ,",
    "it is likely that neutron star matter is an amorphous heterogeneous solid , analogous with a disordered many - component alloy ( jones 1999 ) , and again , nothing is known about its likely response to periodic stress .",
    "thus there is no basis for even a rough estimate of the contribution to shear - mode @xmath7-values from this mechanism .",
    "blaes et al assume that coupling with magnetospheric alfvn waves is the dominant mechanism of damping .",
    "these authors show that , for a typical frequency of @xmath8 hz , shear waves are efficiently reflected from the boundary with the magnetosphere and , in the absence of other damping processes , would have a lifetime @xmath9 s at a reference magnetic flux density of @xmath10 g. the b - dependence of @xmath11 is given in analytical expressions valid asymptotically at frequencies small and large compared with @xmath8 hz .",
    "these are @xmath12 at low freqencies and @xmath13 at high frquencies .",
    "the coupling is therefore an efficient mechanism for energy transfer from crust to magnetosphere at the high magnetic fields assumed in magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "sudden movements of the solid crust , caused by maxwell stresses or otherwise , may then lead to magnetospheric excitation and possibly observable phenomena . in this context",
    ", the present paper examines some processes , specific to neutron stars , which are more accessible to calculation than stress - induced dislocation movement and which might be capable of damping shear waves enough to invalidate this assumption .",
    "shear waves are reflected many times from the boundary with the magnetosphere and possibly from the inner boundary of the crust with the liquid core of the star where the matter density is @xmath14 g @xmath5 .",
    "the number of reflections must be at least of the order of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the neutron star radius and @xmath17 cm s@xmath1 is the shear - wave propagation velocity .",
    "reflection from each boundary is complicated because it couples shear waves with longitudinal sound ( see , for example , landau & lifschitz 1970 , p.103 ) and at @xmath18 , may even depend on the dimensionality of the solid .",
    "it is known that longitudinal sound is strongly absorbed in the core of a neutron star owing to bulk viscosity produced by the strangeness - changing four - baryon weak interaction .",
    "the magnitude of the coefficient is very dependent on the assumptions which must be made , principally about the equation of state at core densities , but the absorption is always strong enough , within certain temperature intervals , to be significant for shear - wave damping .",
    "the shear - wave velocity depends on nuclear parameters according to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the nuclear charge and mass number , and @xmath22 is the spatially - averaged matter density derived from the nuclei alone and excluding the superfluid neutron continuum external to them .",
    "this elementary expression assumes a nuclear effective mass equal to the free mass and , in conjunction with the nuclear parameters listed by negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) , gives a rapid increase of @xmath23 with depth at @xmath24 but no more than a very slow increase at @xmath25 .",
    "( the latter variation seems to be in disagreement with blaes et al who state that @xmath23 is a decreasing function of depth at @xmath25 . ) as a consequence of this variation , shear waves will be refracted radially outward in all regions , as are longitudinal sound waves , but only weakly so at @xmath25 .",
    "but in a typical @xmath26 neutron star , the layers of strong refraction at @xmath24 have depth only of the same order as the wavelength at the relevant frequency of @xmath8 hz .",
    "even assuming , with blaes et al , that the maxwell - stress generated events producing shear waves occur predominantly within this latter region , it follows from this small depth and from the multiplicity of reflections that shear - wave propagation in the neutron drip region at @xmath25 must be considered as a significant source of damping .",
    "thus most of the present paper will describe an investigation in this context of phenomena involving the rapid forced motion of vortices which , for want of any better name , we shall refer to as superfluid friction .",
    "the relevant results for longitudinal sound absorption in the liquid core are considered in section 3 .",
    "an elementary description of superfluid friction is given by considering a region of solid in which the neutron superfluid has rotational angular velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the superfluid velocity @xmath28 is defined ( see sonin 1987 ) as the average over the unit cell of the local vortex lattice .",
    "all velocities are referred to cylindrical polar coordinates rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath29 , coincident at some fiducial time with the angular velocity of the charged components of the star .",
    "the difference @xmath30 is always small compared with @xmath29 . to the extent that steady spin - down of the superfluid occurs",
    ", it is maintained by radial outward expansion of its vortex lattice ; the magnus force @xmath31 acting on an individual vortex is balanced by the force per unit length @xmath32 generated through its motion with velocity @xmath33 , perpendicular to its local axis and relative to the solid .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath34 have to be treated as averages over macroscopic lengths and times , an assumption which is satisfactory provided vortex curvature on these same scales is negligible . a shear wave of wavevector @xmath35 is represented by a solid matter displacement vector @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the velocity relative to the local solid is then @xmath38 , where the shear - wave displacement velocity is @xmath39 and @xmath40 is its component perpendicular to the vortex axis .",
    "the velocity of a point on the vortex axis is @xmath41 .",
    "energy dissipation is obviously changed by the displacement velocity , specifically , by the component @xmath40 .",
    "energy is transferred irreversibly from the shear wave itself and , for most wave directions and polarizations , from the rotational kinetic energy of the superfluid measured in the rotating coordinate system .",
    "it is to be expected that calculation of shear - wave energy - loss rates depends principally on the assumptions made about the dissipative force , and so we are obliged to consider these in as much detail as possible .",
    "the assumptions , made here for almost rectilinear vortices , are that it is possible to define , averaged over macroscopic lengths and times , a force @xmath42 per unit length of vortex , and that fluctuations from it are not so large as to make its use meaningless .",
    "the component of this force parallel with @xmath34 is the dissipative force @xmath43 .",
    "its properties were considered briefly in a previous paper ( jones 2002 ) , but it seems appropriate to give here a more detailed account of what can be deduced about it from the interaction of a vortex , comoving with superfluid of velocity @xmath28 , and a single point defect in the solid structure .",
    "this leads to the excitation of phonons in the solid and , at finite temperatures , of vortex - core quasiparticles ( jones 1990a , b ) , but kelvin wave excitation is easily the most important process ( epstein & baym 1992 , jones 1998 ) . in the case",
    "that the interaction potential is attractive , the coupling always becomes strong at sufficiently small @xmath44 so that the energy transfer to kelvin waves must be calculated non - perturbatively . in the strong - coupling region ,",
    "the vortex is trapped in the potential for a time @xmath45 and the energy transfer is @xmath46 .",
    "we refer to jones ( 1998 ) for details and for a diagram showing a typical vortex orbit within the potential .",
    "( for weak coupling , realized only at values of @xmath44 larger than those considered here , the energy transfer changes to @xmath47 and the vortex orbit is little perturbed by the potential . )",
    "1 shows schematically the effect of a sequence of such interactions , with a dilute distribution of point defects , on the vortex path . each interaction produces a lateral displacement and introduces a trapping time @xmath48 .",
    "it is found that , averaged over impact parameter , the components of the computed impulse on the vortex are approximately equal , @xmath49 where the axes are as labelled in the fig .",
    "1 . the connection between @xmath50 , defined for interaction with an isolated point defect , and the force per unit length @xmath32 , which is an average over macroscopic lengths and times for motion through a dense system of point defects , is a complex problem not considered here .    on microscopic length and time - scales , the vortex has fluctuating motion and , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the macroscopically - averaged vortex velocity @xmath51 is smaller in magnitude than the superfluid velocity @xmath52 with which the vortex would comove in the absence of interaction , and has a component perpendicular to it . for general values of @xmath44 and for a dense system of point defects , it must be presumed that as a consequence of equation ( 1 ) the force @xmath32 has , in addition to the dissipative component @xmath53 , a component @xmath54 parallel with @xmath55 , where the circulation is @xmath56 and @xmath57 is its quantum . in other superfluid problems ,",
    "the existence of this non - dissipative component has been viewed as controversial .",
    "thouless , ao & niu ( 1996 ) have claimed that it does not exist for neutral superfluids in a uniform normal background ( see , however , hall & hook 1998 , sonin 1998 , and the replies therein ) , but a system of point defects is not of this class .",
    "however , in the special case of an infinite linear array of point defects , parallel with @xmath58 , the green function used by jones ( 1998 ) allows one to see that the condition @xmath59 which is necessary for the onset of pinning , can always be satisfied at sufficiently small @xmath44 .",
    "the qualitative form inferred for the dissipative force per unit length of vortex , @xmath60 , is shown in fig .",
    "2 . finite temperatures and quantum - mechanical tunnelling lead to vortex creep and therefore a large and rapidly varying gradient close to @xmath61 .",
    "however , those properties of @xmath62 which are important here can be expressed in the simple function @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 is of the order of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the density of the superfluid continuum outside the nuclei .",
    "it is the only naturally occurring temperature - independent scale of velocity in the problem .",
    "the precise value of the parameter @xmath69 is not important here except in connection with rotational noise generation as mentioned in section 3 ; it is very many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "the linearized equations for the macroscopic hydrodynamics of an incompressible superfluid rotating with angular velocity @xmath29 are : @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the pressure .",
    "comparison with the equations given by sonin ( 1987 ; equations 4.36 - 4.38 ) shows that the tkachenko force , derived from the vortex lattice structure , and the force dependent on vortex curvature have been excluded from equation ( 4 ) .",
    "both are quite negligible in the present context .",
    "these equations are macroscopic in that equation ( 5 ) contains the vortex density @xmath73 , although equation ( 4 ) , with no tkachenko force , is valid for an isolated vortex . at the low vortex densities ( @xmath74 @xmath75 ) of rotating neutron stars , @xmath44 does not change rapidly with time and , for the purpose of understanding vortex unpinning and repinning at a qualitative level , can be treated as a constant in equation ( 4 ) . remembering that @xmath76 , and that all the velocity components with which we are concerned are perpendicular to @xmath77 , the components of equation ( 4 ) parallel with @xmath78 and @xmath79 give an equation for @xmath80 , @xmath81 the roots of this equation are determined by the @xmath80-dependence of the functions @xmath62 and @xmath82 . for consistency with equation ( 2 )",
    ", the latter must satisfy the limit @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "in general , there can be either one or three roots in each of the sectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "a simple example is the instance in which the solid is stationary in the rotating coordinates so that @xmath87 , with force components @xmath88 , and @xmath62 given by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the solutions are shown in fig . 2 for a set of four values of @xmath44 .    in case",
    "( 1 ) , the single root corresponds with an unpinned vortex moving with a velocity @xmath89 . if @xmath44 were decreased to case ( 2 ) , there would be three roots including a pinned solution at very small @xmath80 .",
    "further reduction to case ( 3 ) leads to a critical value @xmath90 ( @xmath91 for @xmath92 ) and to a transition to the pinned solution . at the smaller @xmath44 of case ( 4 ) , only the pinned solution exists .",
    "if equation ( 6 ) has only one root , there is , of course , no discontinuity and @xmath80 varies continuously with @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , this discussion is based on our definition and use of macroscopic averaging , but gives some idea of the unpinning and repinning processes for an isolated vortex .",
    "the very low vortex densities in neutron matter suggest that these , rather than multiple - vortex processes involving vortex - vortex interactions , are the significant consideration .",
    "although the non - dissipative force component @xmath82 is expected to be finite for general values of @xmath80 , any attempt to give it an explicit form would be much less well - based than equation ( 3 ) .",
    "thus the assumption @xmath88 adopted here is the only practical basis for obtaining numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations . resolved into components parallel with the unit vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 in cylindrical polar coordinates , equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are , @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 with regard to boundary conditions , the only practical way of obtaining numerical solutions is to assume an infinite system .",
    "thus the boundary condition that @xmath28 should have no perpendicular component on the spherical surface of the superfluid at @xmath6 is neglected .",
    "solutions are therefore valid only for wavenumbers @xmath99 cm@xmath1 large enough to be consistent with the infinite system assumption .",
    "equations ( 7)-(10 ) also neglect fluctuations in pressure and gravitational potential , a reasonable approximation at the wavenumbers considered here .",
    "any pressure fluctuation caused by the local shear displacement is negligibly small and it is therefore appropriate to adopt the initial conditions @xmath101",
    ". it will be convenient to eliminate @xmath41 from equations ( 7)-(10 ) in favour of @xmath34 .",
    "we also neglect any small differences between the local @xmath77 and the @xmath102 axis .",
    "the solid velocity @xmath103 is resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath102 axis , only the latter , @xmath40 being present in equations ( 7)-(10 ) . the velocity variables are then @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with initial conditions of @xmath106 and a specified value of @xmath107 .",
    "the initial values , @xmath108 , obtained from equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) are for a pinned - vortex solution which is always assumed as the initial condition",
    ". algebraic solution of equations ( 7 ) - ( 10 ) is possible through linearization , which is valid for shear waves of such small amplitude that they can not cause vortex unpinning .",
    "it gives a dissipation rate per unit length of vortex of the order of @xmath109 for any physically reasonable values of the parameters concerned , this is many orders of magnitude too small to be of interest in the present context .    the rate of energy dissipation per unit length of vortex is @xmath110 , which satisfies @xmath111 because @xmath112 and @xmath113 , this can be rewritten as @xmath114 this merely states that the dissipation rate is the sum of the energy loss rates for the shear mode ( @xmath115 ) and for the superfluid . for the chosen initial conditions , equations ( 7)-(10 ) have been solved numerically , with attention to the instabilities discussed in section 2.1 , for several complete cycles of the shear mode in order to obtain values of its time - averaged energy loss rate .",
    "these rates have been calculated for the interval @xmath116 cm s@xmath1 , where @xmath117 is the component of the displacement velocity @xmath118 perpendicular to @xmath58 , and for a distribution of values of its @xmath119 components .",
    "this allows us to obtain , for a given value of @xmath120 and for each of the shear mode polarization states , the energy loss rate averaged over an isotropic distribution of its wave vector @xmath35 .",
    "( the multiple reflection of shear waves makes this average the most appropriate way of presenting the data . )",
    "the energy loss - rates per unit length of vortex , divided by @xmath121 and averaged over both polarization states , are defined as @xmath122 and shown in fig .",
    "3 as functions of @xmath120 for pairs of values of @xmath123 and of @xmath66 .",
    "they are quite insensitive to @xmath124 , @xmath29 and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we have assumed @xmath125 rad s@xmath1 , @xmath126 rad s@xmath1 and @xmath127 cm s@xmath1 throughout . except for velocities close to the unpinning threshold , loss - rates",
    "do not depend strongly on the initial pinned - vortex velocity .",
    "this is demonstrated by the broken curve in fig .",
    "3 which is for @xmath128 , an initial state of an exactly corotating superfluid , @xmath129 . away from the threshold ,",
    "it is almost indistinguishable from the curve for @xmath130 and so we have assumed this latter initial condition for all other curves shown . in general ,",
    "energy loss - rates become large at values of @xmath120 sufficient to produce vortex unpinning and increase to asymptotic values    @xmath131 .",
    "the mode decay time @xmath132 at a given amplitude @xmath120 can be found from its energy density @xmath133 and the loss - rate per unit volume , equal to the product of @xmath134 and the vortex number density @xmath135 .",
    "the function @xmath136 is shown in fig.4 . assuming the lattice parameters calculated by negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) , the density ratio @xmath137 appearing in our , perhaps naive , model of the shear wave varies from zero at the threshold @xmath6 to approximately 8 in the interval @xmath138 g @xmath5 which includes most of the neutron - drip volume .",
    "the product @xmath139 is less than unity for a substantial interval of shear - wave amplitude .",
    "the motivation for expressing the force parameter @xmath65 as in figs .",
    "3 and 4 is that @xmath140 is an upper limit for the superfluid velocity @xmath105 relative to coordinates rotating with angular velocity @xmath29 .",
    "thus values of the order of @xmath141 cm s@xmath1 must exist in some intervals of matter density if angular momentum transfer from crust superfluid is the origin of , or a substantial contributor to , pulsar glitches .",
    "much smaller values may exist in other regions , and the limit @xmath142 must be approached near @xmath6 and @xmath18 . in section 2.1 , it was argued that @xmath66 should be of the order of @xmath143 , but in figs . 3 and 4 , results are also given for values an order of magnitude smaller . from fig .",
    "3 , we can see that the asymptotic value @xmath144 gives a very approximate estimate , @xmath145 , for the energy - loss rate per unit volume , where @xmath146 is here the unit step function .",
    "the order of magnitude of the energy decay time is then @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "it is a function only of @xmath149 , so that even a small - amplitude shear wave is strongly damped in regions of weak vortex - pinning .",
    "it is also temperature - independent , below the superfluid critical temperature , because it depends principally on @xmath62 at values of @xmath80 many orders of magnitude greater than @xmath69 .",
    "the conventionally defined shear viscosity @xmath150 for the solid ( see landau & lifshitz 1970 , p. 155 ) is related with the decay time by @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the shear modulus .",
    "this process has some similarity with stress - induced motion of dislocations , considered briefly by blaes et al .",
    "both involve dissipative motion of a topological defect , either in the superfluid order parameter or in the lattice , but it is not possible to obtain even an order of magnitude estimate of the importance of the latter process .",
    "the force per unit length on a line dislocation is of the order of @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the burgers vector ( see landau & lifshitz 1970 , p. 133 ) ; it is typically some orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath134 .",
    "the dislocation density is not known , but could be many orders of magnitude greater than the vortex density , @xmath155 @xmath75 .",
    "but the time - averaged velocity of an individual dislocation under stress is probably very many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath143 .",
    "the coupling with longitudinal sound referred to in section 1 introduces additional damping .",
    "the most significant source is the bulk viscosity produced by the strangeness - changing four - baryon weak interaction .",
    "the amplitude decay time is @xmath156 at matter density @xmath3 and angular frequency @xmath124 , where @xmath157 is the longitudinal sound velocity in the zero - frequency limit .",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath158 is a function both of temperature and angular frequency .",
    "it also depends on the equation of state at core densities . for recent evaluations , based on differing assumptions , we refer to jones ( 2001 ) , haensel et al ( 2002 ) and lindblom & owen ( 2002 ) . for @xmath159 rad s@xmath1 , a temperature of @xmath160k and @xmath161 g cm@xmath1s@xmath1 ( see jones 2001 ; equation 45 ) , the decay time is @xmath162 s , which would increase by several orders of magnitude if the temperature were to decrease to @xmath163k .",
    "the evaluation of lindblom & owen gives a larger @xmath158 and thus an even shorter decay time .",
    "3 of blaes et al shows the computed alfvn wave luminosity as a function of time following generation of shear waves by a starquake , assuming a magnetic flux density equal to their reference value of @xmath10 g. energy begins to enter the magnetosphere about @xmath164s after the event and the luminosity persists for times just exceeding @xmath165s .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) are associated with long rotation periods , @xmath0 rad s@xmath1 and , in the magnetar model , with surface magnetic fields exceeding @xmath166 g. these very large fields indicate , assuming the @xmath167-dependence of @xmath11 given by blaes et al and referred to in section .",
    "1 , that superfluid friction damping times are probably rather longer than the time @xmath11 for energy transfer by coupling of the shear modes with magnetospheric alfvn waves . in magnetars ,",
    "superfluid friction is unlikely to limit the efficiency of this process .",
    "a similar conclusion , though depending on temperature , holds for the bulk viscosity damping .    duncan ( 1998 ) has examined the excitation and detectability of global seismic modes , particularly low - order toroidal modes , by starquake events .",
    "he assumes that these modes are damped through their interaction with fault lines in the solid and the consequent generation of high - frequency shear waves .",
    "but the superfluid friction calculated in the present paper damps such modes , based on shear deformations , directly .",
    "the damping times found here are much shorter than those considered by duncan and would rule out the existence of other than small mode - amplitudes .",
    "the presence of @xmath29 in equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) represents no more than the mean vortex density of the superfluid .",
    "therefore , superfluid friction would produce extremely strong damping in more rapidly rotating neutron stars , such as the typical radio pulsar with @xmath168 rad s@xmath1 .",
    "this may also be of relevance to the axp and sgr sources , of which all examples so far observed have long periods .",
    "energy transfer through coupling between shear waves and magnetospheric alfvn waves , as in the magnetar model of thompson & duncan ( 1995 ) , is unlikely to be efficient at short periods owing to the very strong damping .",
    "superfluid friction is also likely to be relevant to other current problems such as the possibility of vortex unpinning in precessing neutron stars ( link & cutler 2002 ) , and the damping of r - modes in rapidly rotating neutron stars ( lindblom , owen & morsink 1998 ; andersson , kokkotas & schutz 1999 ) .",
    "many papers on the latter problem have assumed that the solid crust does not participate in the displacement amplitude of the mode , is stationary in rotating coordinates , and therefore acts only as a boundary condition on a thin viscous or turbulent dissipative boundary layer .",
    "but more recent work ( levin & ushomirsky 2001 ; yoshida & lee 2001 ) has recognized that the mode amplitude must penetrate the crust significantly at high values of @xmath29 .",
    "( the radial component of the r - mode displacement , though small , must penetrate the crust . also , an element of solid crust moving with velocity @xmath118 in the rotating coordinates experiences a coriolis force which , for @xmath169 rad s@xmath1 , is of the same order of magnitude as the shear stress integrated over its surface . ) a mode with amplitude large enough for its velocity of displacement to be of the order of @xmath143 will be subject to strong dissipation in the crust , the energy loss - rate there being of the order of @xmath170 per unit volume , as for shear waves . unlike kinetic theory or weak - interaction mechanisms of viscous dissipation ( jones 2001 ; haensel et al 2002 ; lindblom & owen 2002 ) , this is not cut off by exponential factors involving superfluid energy gaps but is approximately temperature - independent below the critical temperatures .",
    "however , the detailed calculation required to obtain the r - mode lifetime is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( 11 ) is the energy - loss rate for the neutron superfluid .",
    "for all the cases in fig .",
    "3 , except for that with the initial condition @xmath128 , the superfluid loses kinetic energy in the rotating frame of reference and is gradually brought into corotation with the charged components of the star .",
    "the initial rate is of the same order as for the shear mode .",
    "superfluid spin - down in the presence of shear waves is governed by the form of @xmath60 at @xmath171 , the position @xmath172 of its maximum being @xmath173 for the specific form given by equation ( 3 ) . in the absence of shear waves ,",
    "the solid matter velocity is @xmath174 and steady - state superfluid spin - down is possible , in principle , if the required vortex - creep velocities , @xmath175 at radius @xmath176 , are smaller than @xmath172 .",
    "the actual form of @xmath62 in this region is unknown , because it is dependent on thermal activation and quantum - mechanical tunnelling , but it would not be unreasonable to assume that it allows this condition to be satisfied given the very small values , @xmath177 cm s@xmath1 required . under this assumption , some perturbing movement of the solid is needed to induce vortex unpinning .",
    "its magnitude depends on the actual form of @xmath60 near its maximum at @xmath172 , but it is likely that quite small values would be sufficient to satisfy the condition @xmath178 in one or more , possibly small , regions of superfluid . following our discussion at the end of section 2.1 , we can see that vortices in these regions would remain unpinned with rapid superfluid spin - down , even if the initial disturbance were to decay to negligible amplitudes , until the critical value @xmath179 is reached .",
    "thus a significant fraction , @xmath180 , of the available superfluid angular momentum in these regions is transferred to the charged components of the star in discontinuous glitch or noise events .",
    "it is worth comparing the crust movements considered here with those assumed in the glitch model of ruderman , zhu & chen ( 1998 ) .",
    "the poloidal velocities of the latter model are not necessarily large enough to generate a significant shear - wave energy density ; it is possible that they are no more than episodes of plastic flow occurring in times smaller than the observed upper limit ( @xmath181s ) for pulsar spin - up , thus with velocities many orders of magnitude smaller than the shear - wave velocity @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", superfluid is spun up or down by the inward or outward radial displacement of the solid with pinned vortices ( see jones 2002 ) .",
    "vortices are not necessarily unpinned although this could occur in any region where the superfluid velocity @xmath44 reaches @xmath143 .",
    "but crust movement with poloidal velocities of the order of @xmath23 is not excluded , in which case glitches would be initiated by the ( @xmath182 ) velocity perturbations considered here .",
    "it is possible that both kinds of movement contribute to the observed glitch population .",
    "this would not be inconsistent with the value of the glitch activity parameter defined by lyne et al ( 2000 ) , which is based on the observation that for all except very young or old pulsars , the summed glitch amplitudes @xmath183 divided by the total observation time is @xmath184 . for this group of pulsars , angular momentum of the same order as that of the total crust superfluid is transferred by glitches rather than by the steady - state superfluid",
    "spin - down described earlier in this paragraph . thus all glitches in radio pulsars may be initiated by crust movements , with poloidal velocities of the order of @xmath23 or much smaller .",
    "such movements occur less frequently , if at all , in very young or old neutron stars for which steady - state superfluid spin - down is more usual .",
    "these modes of glitch formation may well extend to very small events , so giving a model for the observed timing noise in the residual phase and its time derivatives .",
