    "understanding the generic conditions for biodiversity and species extinction remains a challenging problem in evolutionary and population dynamics @xcite .",
    "whereas real world ecological systems are composed of tens or hundreds of species , theoretically well understood cases remain restricted to systems with only very few species that interact in rather simple ways .",
    "but even these very simple cases have revealed a very rich behavior , due to the nonlinearity inherent to this type of systems .",
    "further progress in this field can be expected through the use of well established methods from nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the simplest few species models , like the three - species rock - paper - scissors model or its four species variant , have been the subject of a range of in - depth studies that have unveiled many generic properties of systems with cyclic competition @xcite .",
    "similar studies of more complicated systems composed of multiple species interacting in less trivial ways have been scarce until recently @xcite .",
    "these few investigations of the more complicated cases have been largely restricted to the numerical exploration of the most prominent features . however , in order to develop a better understanding of these cases , analytical approaches are needed . as a first step in that direction we present in this paper some analytical results for a large class of systems that display complicated interaction schemes .",
    "we thereby discuss different dynamics : ( 1 ) lotka - volterra dynamics where the number of individuals is conserved , ( 2 ) may - leonard dynamics where this number is no longer constant , as well as ( 3 ) a mixture of both lotka - volterra and may - leonard dynamics @xcite .",
    "for very general cases we investigate the deterministic mean - field rate equations and determine the space of coexistence fixed points on which species coexist and therefore biodiversity prevails . for cases with a single coexistence fixed point we determine the invariant manifold and study the dynamics around this point . for two - dimensional lattices this is done through a complex ginzburg - landau approach that allows to derive expressions for various quantities of interest .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . after having introduced our model in section 2 ,",
    "we determine in section 3 the space of coexistence fixed points for very general cases .",
    "we thereby obtain that the dimensionality of that space depends on the chosen dynamics . in section 4",
    "we discuss in more detail cases with a single coexistence fixed point and derive for two - dimensional systems the complex ginzburg - landau equations that allow to describe the dynamics in close vicinity to that fixed point . in order to do",
    "so we allow the particles to be mobile and diffuse on the lattice .",
    "these results are then applied to some selected cases .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss some consequences of our results and conclude .",
    "some more technical aspects are discussed in the appendices .",
    "= 3.75 in     we consider systems composed of @xmath0 species living on a lattice where every lattice site is either occupied by a single individual or is empty .",
    "individuals on neighbouring sites interact in the following way : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is one individual from species @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an empty site .",
    "in addition we allow particles to be mobile and diffuse on the lattice by hopping to empty neighbouring sites .    in this work we only consider the case of species independent reaction rates . whereas the first reaction describes the birth of an off - spring with rate @xmath5 , the other two reactions describe predation events .",
    "reaction ( [ eq : reaction2 ] ) is a may - leonard type reaction where a predator simply removes a prey from the system , thereby changing the total number of individuals . allowing for the possibility of empty sites yields the formation of spiral patterns , see @xcite for a discussion of this point .",
    "every species is thereby preying on @xmath6 other species in a cyclic way , i.e. species @xmath3 is preying on species @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( modulo @xmath0 ) .",
    "the second type of predation ( [ eq : reaction3 ] ) is of lotka - volterra type and keeps the total number of individuals constant as a prey is immediately replaced by a predator .",
    "this predation happens again in a cyclic way with each species preying on @xmath11 other species .",
    "for @xmath12 respectively @xmath13 we have a system with may - leonard respectively lotka - volterra dynamics . for the general case , where both @xmath6 and @xmath11 are non zero , we allow for the presence of both types of dynamics .",
    "we call this model the @xmath14 model ( see figure [ fig1 ] for a schematic illustration of the case @xmath15 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 model discussed in @xcite corresponds to the @xmath17 model in this notation .    in a spatial setting",
    "this rather simple looking interaction scheme yields a plethora of different space - time patterns .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show two typical examples in two space dimensions ( see @xcite for other examples ) in absence of mobility .",
    "the ( 3,2,0 ) scheme in figure [ fig2 ] provides an example of coarsening of pure domains : as every species attacks every other species , each individual wants to be surrounded by individuals of the same species , such yielding the situation of complete segregation .",
    "the ( 5,2,0 ) scheme shown in figure [ fig3 ] yields a more complex space - time pattern which results from two different types of spirals that take place in the system at the same time .",
    "these spirals are not permanent and break up easily .",
    "we come back to these different cases later in the paper .",
    "we also note that other types of space time pattern can be realized ( coarsening pattern where each domain contains multiple mutually neutral species that ally in order to fend off other alliances or coarsening pattern where inside the domains non - trivial dynamics emerges due to the fact that the allying species are in a predator - prey relationship ) and refer the interested reader to the paper @xcite for a discussion of these cases .",
    "all these coexistence states are quasi - stationary states : any finite system will eventually end up in an absorbing state where the time needed to enter this final state diverges with the system size @xcite .",
    "= 3.75 in     = 3.75 in     in the following we first neglect any spatial degrees of freedom . we will consider the spatial dependence later when discussing the complex ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "introducing the time - dependent population densities @xmath18 , the mean - field rate equations for the above reaction scheme read : @xmath19~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term describes the birth of off - springs in presence of empty sites , whereas the other terms result from the predation events .",
    "the index @xmath20 means @xmath21 and takes care of the cyclic nature of our reaction scheme ( we use this notation for indices throughout the paper ) .",
    "in addition , we have also introduced the shorthand notations @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the discrete heaviside step function , thus indicating the possible preys for each species .",
    "using the identities @xmath25 and introducing the population density vector @xmath26 allows us to cast the rate equations in the compact form @xmath27 where the elements of the matrix @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 equations ( [ adotvec ] ) and ( [ fij ] ) form the starting point for the following discussion .",
    "in this section we discuss the set of coexistence fixed points as a function of the total number of species @xmath0 and of the number of preys @xmath6 and @xmath11 each species has .",
    "we denote as coexistence fixed point those fixed points for which none of the species is extinct .",
    "the reader should note that for this section it is not needed to have mobile particles .",
    "diffusing particles will be used when we discuss in section 4.3 the complex ginzburg - landau equation for spatial systems .    in general ,",
    "as we allow for empty sites , our system evolves within a @xmath30 simplex where each vertex represents the case where one species ( or empty sites ) completely fills the system .",
    "these vertices are absorbing points from which the system described by the equations ( [ adotvec ] ) and ( [ fij ] ) can not escape . needless to say , that these absorbing points represent the complete loss of biodiversity .",
    "the coexistence fixed points , on the other hand , are the steady states where biodiversity is maximal as all species remain present in the system . setting the left hand side of equation ( [ adotvec ] ) to zero ,",
    "these points are given by the solutions of the equation ( @xmath31 being the vector which has the birth rate @xmath5 as each element ) @xmath32 where the vector @xmath33 has only non - zero elements .",
    "as the matrix @xmath28 is circulant , its ( unnormalized ) eigenvectors can be given as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , its eigenvalues are @xmath36 after some algebraic manipulations ( see appendix a ) , the last equation can be written in the following form : @xmath37 \\right\\ } ( 1-\\delta_{k , n})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the kronecker delta .    inspecting the expression ( [ lambda - k ] ) for the eigenvalues , one sees that ( a ) the eigenvalue @xmath39 is always larger than zero and that ( b ) the eigenvalue @xmath40 with @xmath41 is zero if and only if one of the following three conditions is fulfilled : @xmath42 where in the last condition the parentheses @xmath43 are to be understood in the sense of convention ( [ parentheses ] ) .",
    "one immediately remarks that this last condition can not be satisfied for an odd number of species @xmath0 .      for the case",
    "@xmath44 , where the dynamics is exclusively of may - leonard type , the expression ( [ lambda - k ] ) for the eigenvalues reduces to @xmath45 so that the condition for vanishing @xmath40 is given by the condition that @xmath0 is a divisor of @xmath46 or , equivalently , that @xmath47 introduction of the matrix @xmath48 and its inverse @xmath49 with elements @xmath50 allows us to rewrite equation ( [ eqf ] ) as @xmath51 and therefore @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues @xmath40 of @xmath28 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ lambda ] ) that the dimension @xmath54 of the space of coexistence fixed points is determined by the rank of @xmath53 ( we give some additional details regarding this space of coexistence fixed points in appendix b ) : @xmath55 the rank of @xmath53 is readily obtained from the condition ( [ eqk ] ) under which the eigenvalues @xmath40 vanish : @xmath56~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we finally obtain that for @xmath44 and @xmath57 the dimension of the space of coexistence fixed points is @xmath58      a similar analysis as for the previous case immediately yields the following result for the dimension of the space of coexistence fixed points for the case @xmath60 and @xmath61 where we have only lotka - volterra type dynamics : @xmath62 -1~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as mentioned previously , for the general case where @xmath61 and @xmath57 an eigenvalue @xmath40 vanishes if anyone of the three conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) , or ( [ cond3 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are dealt with in a very straightforward way , following the same steps as for the previous cases where one of the rates is zero , and one obtains that the dimension of the space of coexistence fixed points is then given by @xmath63^{\\equiv n}),(n,[r , r'+1]^{\\equiv n})\\right\\}-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 \\equiv\\ ; \\text{lcm } ( a , b)$ ] and @xmath64^{\\equiv n } \\equiv\\ ; \\theta\\left[(n-1)-[a , b]\\right]\\cdot [ a , b ] + \\theta\\left[[a , b]-n\\right]$ ] .",
    "the condition ( [ cond3 ] ) , which can not be fulfilled if @xmath0 is odd , needs to be treated separately . assuming @xmath0 even , close inspection of ( [ cond3 ] ) reveals that none of the proper divisors @xmath65 of @xmath0 ( which are greater than 1 ) can satisfy this condition .",
    "thus , if ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are not fulfilled , the space of coexistence fixed points is zero - dimensional .",
    "this case therefore is also captured by the expression ( [ d_sigma_nu ] ) .    summarizing this part of the paper , we find that the dimensionality of space of coexistence fixed points depends on the way the predation events are implemented .",
    "this result highlights the importance of the chosen dynamics and further illustrates that conserved and non - conserved dynamics can yield very different results in systems that are otherwise identical .",
    "in systems with a single coexistence fixed point interesting theoretical insights can be gained by studying the motion around this fixed point .",
    "for that the invariant manifold , i.e. the subspace in phase space which is left invariant by the deterministic rate equations , has to be identified .",
    "adding then the spatial degrees of freedom neglected until now yields a system of complex ginzburg - landau equations that contain information on the spreading velocity of traveling waves or the wavelength and frequency of spiral waves . in @xcite",
    "this calculation has been performed for the three - species cyclic may - leonard model which corresponds to the @xmath66 case in the notation adopted in our paper ( see @xcite for some additional details ) . in the following",
    "we expand this calculations to large classes of systems with rather general interaction schemes , provided the space of coexistence fixed points is zero - dimensional .",
    "we start our discussion with the case of an odd number of species @xmath0 that interact in a cyclic way such that @xmath67 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath68 , so that there exists only a single coexistence fixed point , see the previous section .",
    "the steady state equation ( [ eqf ] ) readily yields the reactive fixed point @xmath69 where all species equally coexist .    introducing the coordinates @xmath70 we can rewrite the rate equations as @xmath71 with the matrix @xmath72 and @xmath73    the matrix @xmath74 is diagonalized by means of the matrix @xmath75 , see ( [ eqmatomega ] ) : @xmath76 with the eigenvalues @xmath77 we note that @xmath78 , whereas the other eigenvalues form pairs that are complex conjugate : @xmath79 .    defining the new complex coordinates @xmath80 allows to recast equation ( [ eqx ] ) as @xmath81 with @xmath82 where we used that @xmath83 . for the @xmath0-th component",
    ", this expression reduces to @xmath84 as @xmath85 .    for the cyclic model under investigation the ( unstable )",
    "invariant manifold is locally spanned by the directions of eigenvalues with positive real parts ( the _ positive _ or _ unstable _ directions ) , i.e. to lowest order the invariant manifold is the plane normal to the eigendirections corresponding to eigenvalues with negative real parts ( the _ negative _ or _ stable _ directions ) . whereas for the previously studied case @xmath86 @xcite as well as for the case @xmath87 the invariant manifold is two - dimensional as only one pair of conjugate eigenvalues has a negative real part , the situation is more complicated for larger values of @xmath0 where multiple eigenvalues have negative real parts .    in order to determine the invariant manifold we seek functions of the form @xmath88 where @xmath65 indicates a negative direction whereas the set @xmath89 is the set of coordinates in the positive directions : @xmath90 the summation boundaries are discussed in appendix c. the full problem is obviously of a formidable nature .",
    "luckily , we only need expressions up to second order in the @xmath91 s .",
    "we therefore make the ansatz @xmath92 inserting this ansatz together with the expressions ( [ dotz ] ) and ( [ h_i ] ) into the equation ( [ eqinvman ] ) for the invariant manifold yields @xmath93 from which follows that @xmath94 putting this back into ( [ eqman ] ) leads to the equations @xmath95 that specify the invariant manifold up to quadratic order .      in general ,",
    "whenever the space of coexistence fixed point is zero - dimensional we have that @xmath96 , since by symmetry all components of the coexistence fixed point are identical : @xmath97 therefore for the general case @xmath14 with a single coexistence fixed point the eigenvalue @xmath98 takes the form @xmath99 \\right\\ } \\left ( 1 - \\delta_{k , n } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the steps in the previous subsection , one can then write down for the @xmath100 expressions similar to those obtained for the case with @xmath67 ( see equations ( [ h_i ] ) and ( [ h_n ] ) ) : @xmath101 more problematic are the steps that deal with the invariant manifold and the dynamics on this manifold",
    ". indeed , although the @xmath98 s are all non - zero , their real part might be zero depending on the combination of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , and @xmath65 as well as on the values of the rates @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in such cases one needs to perform a further center manifold reduction and go beyond the linear order for the determination of the converging or diverging behavior of those specific directions near the coexistence fixed point .    from now on we exclusively focus on those cases for which all @xmath98 s have a nonvanishing real part . under this additional constraint",
    "the local specification of the invariant manifold is straightforward . as before we project the dynamics onto the unstable manifold by expressing the negative or stable directions ( i.e. @xmath65 s with @xmath104 ) , up to quadratic order , in terms of the positive or unstable directions .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath105 where the shorthand notation @xmath106 means the set of unstable ( positive ) directions , i.e. the sum is over terms where both @xmath107 and @xmath108 label unstable directions . in equation ( [ z_k_gen ] ) the parameters @xmath109",
    "are given by @xmath110 with @xmath111    in vicinity of the unstable fixed point , this brings the rate equations on the unstable manifold to the following form ( @xmath112 ) @xmath113    the next step is to suppress the quadratic terms in the above equations .",
    "this is achieved by means of a family of near identity transformations as @xmath114 where @xmath115 are quadratic polynomials in the coordinates of the unstable directions @xmath116 @xcite : @xmath117 this transformation will dismiss the quadratic terms ( with suitable choice of @xmath118 ) at the price of introducing further cubic terms .",
    "actually , a subset of these cubic terms are welcome as we aim at ending up with a family of stuart - landau normal forms .",
    "the rest , however , is redundant and can again be suppressed by another family of near identity transformations @xmath119 where @xmath120 is cubic in coordinates corresponding to the unstable directions : @xmath121 here the bar indicates that the @xmath122 terms , needed for the stuart - landau normal forms , are preserved in the process of transforming the rate equations ( [ rate - uns ] ) .",
    "careful performance of transformations ( [ hr2 ] ) and ( [ hr3 ] ) then results in the following set of stuart - landau normal forms _ on the unstable manifold _ ( @xmath112 ) : @xmath123 restricting ourselves to the directions with negative imaginary part of the eigenvalue , this can be brought in the standard form @xmath124 with @xmath125      recalling that we allow for mobile particles , we want to incorporate at this stage the mobility of particles that can diffuse by jumping to an empty neighbouring site .",
    "following @xcite we then obtain in the continuum limit the following reaction - diffusion equations for the space- and time - dependent particle densities : @xmath126~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that differ from the rate equations ( [ adot ] ) by the diffusion term @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the diffusion constant that depends on the rate for jumps into unoccupied neighbouring sites .",
    "note that the realization of mobility through jumps into empty sites yields nonlinear diffusive terms in addition to the usual linear term @xcite . as we expect the dynamics to be dominated by the long wavelength modes , we only keep the leading order gradient term in equation ( [ rd ] ) .    when redoing the calculation of the previous subsection with this equation , one notes the appearance of nonlinear diffusive terms due to the nonlinearities of the coordinate transformations .",
    "these nonlinear terms are expected to be subleading when the dynamics is dominated by the long wavelength modes @xcite .",
    "we therefore ignore these additional terms and end up with the following system of partial differential equations : @xmath129 where @xmath116 labels the unstable directions with negative imaginary parts .",
    "this is a set of complex ginzburg - landau equations similar to those that have been studied extensively in the past in a large variety of different physical situations @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that neglecting the nonlinear diffusive terms is an uncontrolled approximation and that _ a posteriori _ tests are needed to check how reliable this approximation really is .",
    "for the three - species case ( 3,1,0 ) , where the same assumptions have been made , it was checked through numerical simulations that the resulting complex ginzburg - landau equation faithfully describes some of the main features of the corresponding lattice model @xcite .",
    "similar tests for checking the reliability of this approximation should also be done for the larger class of models studied in our paper , and we plan to come back to this important aspect in the future .    from these equations a variety of quantities can be computed .",
    "first we note that in the case @xmath130 and @xmath131 the complex ginzburg - landau equation reduces to the time - dependent real ginzburg - landau equation used commonly for the description of coarsening in ferromagnets @xcite ( see @xcite for a comparison between the dynamics in the complex and the real ginzburg - landau equations ) . for the case @xmath132 and @xmath133 the corresponding complex ginzburg - landau equation allows to describe spiral waves and derive analytical expressions for a range of relevant quantities @xcite .",
    "for example for the linear spreading velocity @xmath134 one obtains @xmath135 whereas the wavelength @xmath136 and the frequence @xmath137 of the spiral are given by @xmath138      let us now apply this formalism to the two examples given in section 2 .    for the case ( 3,2,0 ) , see figure [ fig2 ] , we have only one unstable direction .",
    "a straightforward calculation then yields the expressions @xmath139 for the four parameters in equation ( [ diff ] ) . as @xmath140",
    "the complex equation reduces to the real one .",
    "consequently , one expects for this interaction scheme the appearance of coarsening domains , in complete agreement with the pattern showing up in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the case ( 5,2,0 ) , see figure [ fig3 ] , represents a more complicated situation with two unstable directions @xmath141 and @xmath142 and two complex ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "applying our formalism to this case yields the following expressions : @xmath143 one notes that @xmath144 but @xmath145 .",
    "this describes a situation of two different types of spirals with the same spreading velocities but different wavelengths .",
    "close inspections of snapshots like that shown in figure [ fig3 ] reveals indeed the presence of two different types of spirals , characterized by different thicknesses of their spiral arms ( which corresponds to different wavelengths ) , that interfere continually .",
    "in this paper we have derived complex ginzburg - landau equations for @xmath0 species models in two dimensions with a large range of different interaction schemes given by the reactions ( [ eq : reaction1])-([eq : reaction3 ] ) . depending on the values of the parameters ,",
    "a range of scenarios can be realised , as for example coarsening of pure domains , single spiral waves , or interacting multiple spiral waves .",
    "numerical simulations of the corresponding lattice gas models show a quantitative agreement with the predictions that follow from the values of the parameters in the complex ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "however , as neglecting the nonlinear diffusive terms that emerge when applying the nonlinear transformations is an uncontrolled approximation , more advanced checks through the quantitative comparison of the predictions from the complex ginzburg - landau equations and the results from lattice model simulations are needed in order to fully assess the reliability of this approximation .",
    "it should be noted that recently an alternative approach was proposed that allows to derive in a more controlled way , through a perturbative expansion , a set of complex ginzburg - landau equations for systems with cyclic competition and an additional mutation process @xcite .",
    "this method has been used successfully for the three - species case ( 3,1,0 ) .",
    "the same approach should also work for the larger class of models discussed in our manuscript , and it would be interesting to compare our results with results obtained from this alternative approach .",
    "there are two standard ways to implement mobility in systems where at most one particle is allowed at any lattice site : diffusion , realised through the hopping of particles to empty sites , and particle swapping , where particles on neighbouring sites exchange places . in this paper",
    "we restricted ourselves to the first case .",
    "however , the space - time pattern may change depending on the chosen way to implement mobility . as an example we show in figure [ fig4 ] the ( 5,2,0 ) case with swapping , which should be compared to figure [ fig3 ] which shows a snapshot of the same system in absence of mobility . using swapping yields pronounced and very stable spirals , characterised by wave number and frequency that differ from those obtained from the case with diffusion .",
    "we will address the cases with swapping in a separate publication .",
    "= 3.75 in     obviously our numerical simulations are of stochastic nature , but we exclusively focused on deterministic equations in our theoretical treatment .",
    "one may then wonder how the inclusion of noise , that yields a system of coupled stochastic partial differential equations , would change our results . a first , rather trivial remark , is that in simulating a finite system one eventually ends up with the extinction of some of the species @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus on earlier times that are much shorter than any extinction times .",
    "for the three - species may - leonard model , the model ( 3,1,0 ) in our notation , it was found @xcite that the numerically determined spreading velocity quantitatively agrees with the prediction from the complex ginzburg - landau equation , and this for a large range of values of the reaction rates .",
    "the functional dependence of the wavelength was also found to agree between numerics and theory .",
    "however , other interaction schemes , especially for more than three species , have not been studied in the same way .",
    "it is therefore an important open question whether a similar good quantitative agreement can be achieved for more complicated cases .",
    "we plan to come back to this question in the future .",
    "another interesting question concerns the cases where at least one of the eigenvalues @xmath98 ( [ lambdak ] ) has a vanishing real part . in that case",
    "an additional center manifold reduction has to be performed in order to go beyond the linear order .",
    "this is a very demanding calculation that we leave for the future .",
    "although our study deals with a large class of systems , the derivation of the complex ginzburg - landau equations remains restricted to cases where the space of coexistence fixed points is zero - dimensional .",
