    "topological materials , such as insulators and superconductors , have attracted enormous interest in the recent years , as a novel form of quantum matter exhibiting a whole array of fascinating properties @xcite . in particular , _ disordered _ low - dimensional quantum materials present an intriguing interplay between topology and localization , eventually leading to the suppression of anderson localization in the vicinity of a phase transition between two distinct topological phases @xcite .",
    "this motivates an intense study of the basic mechanisms which govern the transport properties of low - dimensional quantum materials in the vicinity of a topological phase transitions .",
    "recent work in this direction has highlighted an intriguing tendency to ultra - retarded transport as described by classical _",
    "sinai diffusion _ in a random _ force _ field .",
    "such tendency is , at least at a first glance , quite surprising , for there is no reason a - priori why transport phenomena in low - dimensional quantum disordered materials should exhibit any analogy with a classical langevin particle in a random force field .",
    "such an analogy has been analysed in a recent paper , in the context of quantum transport in majorana quantum wires @xcite , based on analytical inspection of the one - dimensional dirac equation for a free quantum - relativistic particle with a zero - average random mass . in this paper , we analyse a similar problem by means of numerical simulations of the random - mass dirac equation based on the quantum lattice boltzmann method @xcite .",
    "our numerical results confirm strong localization at increasing noise strength , and provide indications of ultra - slow sinai diffusion as well .",
    "in 1982 sinai analyzed the classical motion of a stochastic particle moving in a random _ force _ field @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle momentum , @xmath2 the friction frequency and @xmath3 a random force with zero mean and variance @xmath4 .",
    "analytical treatment of the above langevin equation , shows that diffusion proceeds at ultra - slow rates , with a variance scaling as : @xmath5 @xmath6 being the localization length of the corresponding probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "such ultra - slow diffusion is basically due to the fact that a random force translates into a relatively regular potential @xmath8 , whose barriers are more effective than random ones in trapping the particle in the corresponding local minima .",
    "the first evidences that sinai diffusion might be relevant to relativistic quantum transport was provided by pioneering work on one - dimensional random mass dirac fermions and equivalent random ising chains @xcite .    indeed , the analysis of the dirac equation with a random mass , such that @xmath9 shows that the spectrum becomes not only gapless but also quantum critical , i.e. it supports order - disorder transitions driven by purely quantum fluctuations , with no contributions from thermal ones .",
    "this can be heuristically understood by nothing that the zero - energy ( steady - state ) dirac equation is formally solved by @xmath10 , so that , away from null points , where @xmath11 , the critical solutions decay like @xmath12 . for small positive - energy solutions @xmath13 ,",
    "the behaviour remains similar , and it can be shown that states separated in space by an overlap @xmath14 repel each other with an energy @xmath15 , leading to correlations between spatial and time scales of the order of @xmath16 . by letting @xmath17 , this gives precisely sinai s diffusion .",
    "numerical solution of random - mass dirac equations have been performed before @xcite . however , no special emphasis on connections between localization and sinai s diffusion have been provided . in the sequel ,",
    "we focus precisely on this aspect , by using the quantum lattice boltzmann ( qlb ) method , to be shortly described in the next section .",
    "let us recall the main ideas behind the quantum lattice boltzmann scheme in one dimension .",
    "consider the dirac equation in one dimension .",
    "using the majorana representation @xcite and projecting upon chiral eigenstates , the dirac equation reads : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath14 are complex wave functions composing a two - component spinor @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the compton frequency . + as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) is a discrete boltzmann equation for a couple of complex wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "the propagation step consists of streaming @xmath19 and @xmath14 along the @xmath22-axis with opposite speeds @xmath23 , while the collision step is performed according to the scattering matrix defined by the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) .",
    "+ the qlb scheme is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) along the characteristics of @xmath19 and @xmath14 respectively and approximating the right hand side integral by using the trapezoidal rule . assuming @xmath24 , the following scheme is obtained @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the dimensionless compton frequency .    the linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_qlb ] ) is algebraically solved for @xmath31 and @xmath32 and yields the explicit scheme : @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "note that , since @xmath36 , the collision matrix is unitary , thus the method is unconditionally stable and norm - preserving .",
    "+ in natural units ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the ability of the qlb method to solve the dirac equation for particle with constant mass has been discussed before in the literature @xcite . in this section",
    "we present numerical results of the propagation of a free dirac particle with random mass . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time qlb is applied to such a problem .      in this section ,",
    "the time - evolution of a gaussian wave packet is computed by using a random mass in order to inspect the effect of the random component on the wave packet localization .",
    "+ in particular , the following initial condition is used @xmath41 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define a localization functional in order to `` measure '' the localization of a waveform in one spatial dimension @xmath42:=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\lvert \\sqrt{p(z ) } \\frac{d^2}{dz^2 } \\sqrt{p(z ) }   \\rvert dz\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "an approximated localization width for @xmath7 is defined by @xmath44:=\\sqrt{c / l[p(z)]}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "+ we set @xmath46 and a gaussian distributed random mass with average @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( in order to observe sinai diffusion ) and standard deviation @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the spatial domain @xmath55 $ ] is discretized with a lattice of size @xmath56 . for each value of @xmath57 ,",
    "ensemble average over @xmath58 realizations has been performed .",
    "+ in figures 1 - 5 , the strong effect due to the random mass is shown , for each value of @xmath57 and @xmath59 ( a ) and @xmath48 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , in fig .  [",
    "fig : mass0_w ] , the localization function ( [ eq : w ] ) is reported for each value of @xmath57 showing an increasing localization at increasing values of @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig : mass0_d ] shows the wave packet dispersion as a function of time .",
    "the evolution of the wave packet dispersion is computed as follows @xmath60 where @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass0_d ] ( b ) for each curve a fit with the function @xmath62 , is also reported , from which we can observe that for @xmath48 , the wave packet dispersion follows a @xmath63 law , as expected for the sinai diffusion .",
    "+ moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig : wasymptotic ] , the asymptotic value of @xmath64 $ ] is plotted as a function of @xmath57 and compared with a fit against the function @xmath65 .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath59 ( a ) and @xmath48 ( b ) , respectively .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass0_psi ] the evolution in time of @xmath68 is shown for a single realisation of the random mass , for @xmath59 ( a ) and @xmath48 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "+ from this figure , we observe that for the massive case @xmath59 , the up and downward moving wave packets remain tightly coupled throughout , due to the strong inter - mixing due to the non - zero mass .",
    "thus , the two spinor components behave much like a single ( non - relativistic ) wavepacket , which gets increasingly corrugated due to the random fluctuations .",
    "note that since none of such fluctuations comes any close to the mean value @xmath59 , the corrugations are comparatively weak and do not alter the qualitative space - time pattern of the wavepacket .",
    "the case with @xmath48 shows a more intriguing story . in the absence of noise ,",
    "the up and down components of the spinor propagate freely and independently along the @xmath69 axis , respectively . as noise",
    "is switched on around a zero - mass average , negative values of the mass eventually occur , which spawn side - branches propagating in the opposite direction , i.e. a negative - mass fluctuation of the up - mover along @xmath70 spawns a down - mover side - branch , and viceversa .",
    "note indeed that the mass - inversion symmetry @xmath71 , as combined with the exchange of the up - down spinors , @xmath72 , leaves the dirac equation invariant .",
    "the side - branches , in turn , spawn secondary side branches in a sort of recursive cascade which gives rise to a `` network '' of correlations .",
    "such correlations progressively fill the ground between the two original up and down movers , resulting in a highly corrugated and `` networked '' wave function .",
    "remarkably , the dispersion of such `` networked '' wavefunction obeys sinai s diffusion scaling .",
    "a word of caution is in order : the logarithmic fits of the wave packet dispersion are found to be fairly sensitive to the numerical values of the fitting parameters @xmath73 and @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , a statistically accurate assessment of the actual exponent of sinai ultra - low diffusion must await for further systematic studies .",
