    "this trap construction can be generalized in a straightforward way to 2d quasiperiodic traps , via intersection of a light sheet with a 3d large - period lattice .",
    "this direct experimental realization of the simplest quasiperiodic lattices is also intrinsically tunable : variation of the intersection angle @xmath3 tunes the properties of the resulting potential , generating different members of this family of quasicrystals , and variation of the offset transverse to the cut beam axis drives phasonic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly discuss the practical optics required to realize such a potential .",

    "topological pumping is possible because the wave functions and energy spectra of the generalized fibonacci optical lattice depend in a non - trivial way on the offset of the cutting beam with respect to the lattice . in the terminology of quasicrystals ,",
    "this offset is a phasonic degree of freedom .",
    "just as phonon modes arise from discretely broken real - space translation symmetry , phason modes arise from broken translation symmetry in the higher - dimensional space from which a quasiperiodic lattice is projected  @xcite . in a fibonacci - type optical lattice , this corresponds to symmetry under relative translation of the cut beam and the lattice in a direction transverse to the cut beam .",

    "hence do not have true dynamical goldstone modes , we may simulate the effects of phonons and phasons by suitable manipulations of the lattice and cutting lasers : for instance , shaking the lattice parallel or transverse to the cut corresponds to driving a phonon or a phason , respectively .",
    "phasons have important but incompletely understood effects on thermal and electronic transport in real quasicrystals  @xcite .",
    "this is of interest not only for fundamental reasons , but also because of potential technological applications of quasicrystals anomalous electrical and thermal transport characteristics .",
    "the influence of phasons is not understood in large part because of the experimental difficulty of disentangling the effects of domain walls , crystalline impurities , and disorder from those due to phason modes .",
    "a unique aspect of the generalized fibonacci optical lattice is that it enables direct oscillatory driving of phason modes .",
    "measuring the response of the system to driving such modes at variable frequency would constitute a new kind of lattice modulation spectroscopy , in which the modulation occurs in the higher - dimensional space from which the quasiperiodic lattice is projected .",

    "note that we have deliberately chosen to include the kinetic energy along @xmath52 as part of the perturbation @xmath53 , as this simplifies the calculations .",

    "it is convenient to account for this by computing corrections to an effective potential for the longitudinal motion @xmath55 order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "in other words , we restrict the transverse motion to a specified subband ( here , we take @xmath56 for specificity , but similar arguments apply , _ mutatis mutandis _ , for any @xmath57 ) and compute corrections due to virtual fluctuations to higher subbands order - by - order in perturbation theory .        in the above expression ,",
    "we have introduced a shorthand for the inter - subband matrix elements of the lattice potential , v_l^ln(r _ ) d r _ ^*_l(r _ ) v_l(r _ , r _ ) _ n(r _ ) .",
    "it is evident that the perturbative expansion is controlled by the ratio @xmath59 of the inter - subband matrix elements to the subband splitting .",
    "this parameter is straightforwardly tunable in the proposed optical realization of the generalized fibonacci lattice .",
    "note that the effective mass will be corrected at higher orders of perturbation theory , and that we may need to be careful about degeneracies introduced at higher orders ; a complete analysis of the perturbation theory is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , some key qualitative features of the perturbative series , modulo these possible complications , may be extracted simply by studying the form of the perturbation series , as we show in the next section .",
    "we now turn to an analysis of fourier components of the effective potential @xmath60 .",
    "consider the @xmath61 term . since there is a single occurrence of @xmath54 at this order",
    ", we see that its fourier transform with respect to @xmath52 will contain only the harmonics present in @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to see that at this order , the fourier transform has bragg peaks only at @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( throughout , we ignore @xmath65 peaks as they correspond to an unimportant uniform offset of the energy ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath60 consists of a pair of harmonics whose minima are respectively at lattice spacings of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the ratio of these spacings is indeed the golden ratio , @xmath69 .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the relative amplitudes of the bragg peaks is given by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the characteristic ` oscillator length ' of the trap potential .    at second order , we have two occurrences of @xmath54 in @xmath60 , leading to bragg scattering at wave vectors @xmath73 , with the signs all chosen independently",
    ". the relative amplitudes between these peaks are trickier to evaluate analytically , but may be readily computed numerically as needed ; however , from the fact that these peaks only emerge at second order , they are accompanied by a factor of @xmath74,with @xmath4 or @xmath45 chosen according to whether we obtain @xmath75 from the leading peaks by adding @xmath76 or @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fourierspectrum ] for a plot of the calculated fourier spectrum .",
    "we see that we recover a complicated sequence of bragg peaks as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory . at each order we will find bragg peaks at higher harmonics , but",
    "these will be correspondingly at suppressed amplitude .",
    "generalizing the line of reasoning above , we see that perturbation theory up to order @xmath78 yields a set of bragg peaks g \\ { m k + n k } where @xmath79 are integers with @xmath80 , with amplitude f_g~ .    .",
    "note that this is the analytically obtained fourier transform of the potential itself , rather than the numerically obtained fourier transform of the atomic density , which is shown in fig .  3 of the main text .",
    "]    the above discussion should make it evident that , at least in principle , the fourier transform of @xmath60 is characterized by a singular continuous spectrum , as long as the cut angle is such that @xmath81 is irrational : in this case , there is no algebraic relation between @xmath82 , and thus the set @xmath83m , n@xmath84 has no smallest vector .",
    "however , as computed above , and commented on in more detail below , many peaks for large @xmath85 will have extremely small amplitudes and are for practical purposes absent .",
    "nevertheless , this demonstrates that the generalized fibonacci optical lattice is strictly more quasicrystalline than the bichromatic potentials created to date , and should be sufficient to explore a variety of relevant physical questions .",
    "the quick decay of bragg peak amplitudes at higher orders is a consequence of the single - harmonic form of the lattice potential and the ` soft ' projection imposed by the gaussian beam .",
    "traditional treatments of quasicrystals ( see , e.g. @xcite ) differ from this in two ways : ( i ) they discuss a multiple - harmonic lattice , such as the one produced by a periodic delta - function array ; and ( ii ) they incorporate a singular cut ( for instance , a step function ) .",
    "as the quasicrystalline potential is the product of these , the fourier spectrum of the resulting 1d quasicrystal is obtained by convolving the fourier transform of the lattice , which consists of equal - amplitude peaks at reciprocal lattice vectors , with the slowly decaying fourier spectrum of a step function ( the slow decay is a consequence of the step - edge singularity ) .",
    "the resulting bragg peaks have an amplitude that decays very slowly ( as a power law ) with their wave vector .",
    "although this slow decay is known to play an important role in @xmath86 quasicrystals @xcite , we note that our approach nevertheless retains the dominant features of quasiperiodicity , namely a set of incommensurate bragg peaks .",
    "indeed , even purely bichromatic lattices are known to have a localization - delocalization transition .    as a final comment ,",
    "observe that the leading term in our perturbative approach is a direct transcription of cut - and - project : we could have obtained this by convolving the harmonic potential with the gaussian that describes the atomic density transverse to the cut axis ( this is the ` tube ' that the harmonically confined atoms are restricted to . ) however , the higher - order terms ( that generate higher bragg peaks ) are in fact non - classical : they emerge due to virtual fluctuations , and have no classical analogue .",
    "( note that a corollary of the previous observation is that the strength of higher - order bragg peaks may be enhanced by the inclusion of higher harmonics in @xmath54 , as these would then contribute already at leading order . )",
    "a key feature of our set - up is the inherent tunability afforded by the cut - and - project approach . as an example , we sketch a prescription of how to achieve the aubry - andr limit in the cut - and - project approach .",
    "to do this , we exploit the ability to impose an anisotropic lattice potential in two dimensions . in the limit @xmath87",
    ", we simply have a stripe modulation in 2d .",
    "the effective 1d potential is periodic , with spacing given by @xmath88 . for a strong gaussian beam @xmath89",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to leading order in perturbation theory , so that it suffices to consider the leading harmonic of this 1d potential , with strength @xmath90 ( here and below , we have ignored factors of @xmath91 as we are interested in the scaling rather than precise numerical factors ) . assuming a relatively deep lattice , we may approximate the projected 1d lattice by a tight - binding chain : in second - quantized form , we have h _ -j_i(b^_i b_i+1 + b^_i+1 b_i ) - _ i b^_i b_i [ eq:1dtb ] with a hopping matrix element ( using standard techniques , @xcite ) j e_r ( ) ^3/4 where @xmath92 is the effective 1d recoil energy ( this is proportional to the recoil energy of the 2d lattice , but as is the case for other quantities , may differ by factors of @xmath91 due to the projection . )",
    "next , we impose a weak periodic potential in the @xmath45 direction , by allowing @xmath93 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath94 , we may simply consider the additional contribution to the effective potential due to @xmath95 as a weak perturbation to the dominant contribution due to @xmath96 ( while still ignoring transitions to higher subbands of the trapping beam ) .",
    "this additional contribution comes from harmonics at @xmath97 , with strength @xmath98 . since @xmath99 ,",
    "this may be incorporated as a weak onsite modulation to the 1d tight - binding hamiltonian ,      which is equivalent to that of the aubry - andr model with a phase offset of zero .",
    "we may recover the full aubry - andr model by also including an offset phase in the @xmath100 term of eq.([eq : rotatedv_l ] ) ."
