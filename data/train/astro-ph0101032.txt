    "we must add the systematic errors due to the uncertainties in gravity ( note that barbuy 1988 used only 3 lines of each sci and scii to estimate the gravity ) and effective temperature .",
    "this makes the total error from the [ oi ] line large .",
    "another problem is that the gravities of metal - poor giants derived from the lte fe analysis are most probably underestimated because of the neglect of nlte effects .",

    "work is in progress to study nlte effects on fe in several metal - poor giants and our preliminary results indicate that corrections to gravities derived from the lte analysis of fe can indeed be as large as + 0.5 dex .",
    "we also note that recently takeda et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed that the [ oi ] lines in metal - poor giants may suffer some filling in emission that leads to the weakening of the absorption lines .",
    "this possibility has been noticed by langer ( 1991 ) , who proposed that the emission from the surrounding nebulosity , formed from the mass ejected in the post - rgb phase , may account for the observed weakness of the forbidden lines .",
    "the fact that some giants such as hd115444 show [ o / fe ] about 0.3 dex larger ( westin et al . 2000 ) than `` expected '' from the @xmath6 ( [ o / fe ] @xmath3 0.4 ) supports this idea .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that there is no discrepancy between [ oi ] , oi , and oh in several unevolved dwarfs .",
    "the analysis carried out by fk is based on gravities derived from lte fe ionization balance of these subgiants where the nlte effects are strong . in general ,",
    "nlte effects play a dominant role in very metal - poor stars due to a decrease in electron density . collisions with free electrons no longer dominate the kinetic equilibrium as they do in the stars of solar composition , and this leads to significant deviations from lte .",
    "another consequence of the metal deficiency is an appreciable weakening in uv blanketing .",
    "both effects lead to a large depletion of the  atoms affecting the equivalent widths and central depths of spectral lines ( shchukina & trujillo bueno 2000 ) . in a recent paper , allende prieto et al .",

    "they find that gravities are systematically underestimated when derived from ionization balances , and that upward corrections of 0.5 dex or even higher can be required at metallicities similar to those of our stars .",
    "we remark here that any underestimation of gravities will also strongly underestimate the abundances inferred from the forbidden and triplet lines .",
    "the abundances derived from oh will be affected as well but in the oposite direction .",
    "thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) derived gravity corrections of up to 0.5 dex with respect to lte values , for the case of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath53 .",
    "they have shown that nlte effects are important in determining stellar parameters from iron ionization balance .",
    "it has been established ( see rutten 1988 , and references therein ) that a strong overionization of neutral iron in metal - poor stars leads to the systematic difference in abundances determined from the  and  lines .",
    "this difference increases with decreasing metallicity . for the  lines nlte effects",
    "are found to be unimportant .",
    "the nlte modeling predicts a dependence of the nlte abundance corrections of  lines on the lower excitation potential ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "the nlte abundance corrections in the sun are in the range 0.020.1  dex , while in the main - sequence stars later than type a they can reach 0.30.4  dex .    taking the above into account",
    ", we evaluate the extent to which nlte effects could influence the determination of the stellar parameters of @xmath55 .",
    "our study is based on horizontally homogeneous models of lte atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "our nlte stellar parameter analysis is based on the usual assumptions : i ) iron abundances used to fit ews of   and  lines to observed ones have to be independent of excitation potential of the lower level @xmath54 ; ii ) the iron abundances have to be independent on the line strengths ; namely , the stronger  lines have on average to give the same abundance as the weaker ones ; iii ) the average abundances obtained from  and  lines have to be equal .",
    "the theoretical ews of the  and   lines were computed using the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "nlte departure coefficients were found from the self - consistent solution of the kinetic and radiative - transfer equations using a new nlte code , nataja ( see for details @xcite ; shchukina & trujillo bueno 2000 ) .",
    "here it is enough to mention that we employed novel and effective iterative multilevel transfer methods and formal solvers that are capable of handling hundreds of transitions efficiently and make feasible 2d and 3d multilevel modeling ( auer , fabiani bendicho , & trujillo bueno 1994 , @xcite ) .",
    "our  @xmath24  atomic model takes into account a multiplet structure and includes over 250 levels and 500 uv , optical , and ir transitions including the regime near  continuum .",
    "the  term diagram is , in fact , complete up to @xmath59  ev . at higher energies",
    "it contains about 50% of the terms identified by nave et al .",
    "the  diagram is very similar to the atomic model of gigas ( 1986 ) .",
    "it contains only the lowest terms with @xmath60  ev and 25 strong transitions ( see shchukina & trujillo bueno 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "notwithstanding such a comprehensive atomic model it contains only 21 lines from the list of  lines observed and measured in the spectrum of @xmath55 by fk .",
    "all of them except one line cluster into a narrow @xmath54 range between 2 and 3 ev .",
    "we marked them in figures 5 and 6 by large unfilled circles .",
    "the only line that is outside the range ( @xmath61   ) has @xmath54 = 4.16 ev .",
    "this selection effect prevents us from using the  abundance versus @xmath54-trend as a criterion of correctness of the stellar parameters . to avoid this shortcoming we tried to extend our line list to larger @xmath54-samples .",
    "according to fk , lte synthesis of the 58  lines for the atmospheric model with parameters derived by these authors ( @xmath62 , @xmath44 = 2 , and @xmath63 ) produces very good agreement with observations ( the standard deviation , @xmath52 , is only 0.04 dex ) .",
    "if we assume that these stellar parameters reproduce both the ews from fk , and that such modeling of  lines is correct not only for their observed list of  lines but also for other  lines located in the same wavelength region ( 40008000  ) , then we can consider synthetic lte equivalent widths of the latter lines as `` observed '' ones .",
    "following this idea we have selected from our atomic model 98  lines and calculated their lte equivalent widths using the model atmosphere with stellar parameters obtained by fk .",
    "furthermore , these equivalent widths , ranging from 1.5 to 80 m , are consider as `` quasi - observations '' .",
    "the wavelengths of these  lines , their @xmath54-values , and oscillator strengths are listed in table 5 .",
    "note that these lines are distributed rather uniformly with @xmath54 .",

    "it is interesting to note that everywhere in our figures , abundances for the aforementioned high - excitation  line @xmath61     deviate considerably in comparison with those for other high - excitation lines . for  lines we used the _ real _ observations obtained by fk , which includes seven lines .",
    "our nlte simulation reveals that  lines in all the atmospheric models considered do not suffer in fact from nlte effects .",
    "however , this is not the case for the  lines .",
    "the lte abundances derived from the  lines are lower compared with nlte values .",
    "our computations clearly demonstrate that for the fixed value of metallicity the nlte corrections are very sensitive to the changes in @xmath29 and @xmath44 . the nlte corection increases with @xmath29 due to the ultraviolet overionization effects . for the same @xmath29 a larger gravity results in larger nlte abundance corrections .",
    "the mean @xmath66 are in the range 0.2  0.35  dex .    the nlte abundance corrections for individual  lines and for the stellar parameters of @xmath55 suggested by fk are plotted in figure 5 . the abundance corrections are largely independent on the excitation potential up to @xmath67  ev .",
    "however , @xmath68 decreases when the lines with @xmath69  ev are considered .",
    "the mean value of the nlte abundance correction @xmath68 for the  lines is 0.22  dex while for the  lines there are no corrections for departures from lte . although the standard deviation of the abundance derived from  lines is not very large ( 0.07  dex ) there is a trend with @xmath54 and a clear gap of 0.11  dex between the abundances derived from the `` low '' ( @xmath70  ev ) and `` high '' ( @xmath71  ev ) excitation lines . in general , the gap is smaller in the case of lte .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that dependence on the line strength is less pronounced .",
    "our computations confirm the results by thevenin & idiart that the lte fe analysis in very metal - poor stars strongly underestimates gravities and metallicities .",
    "if we take into account the nlte abundance corrections , the stellar parameters suggested by fk do not meet the condition requiring equal abundances derived from the  and  lines .",
    "the abundance difference due to neglect of the nlte effects in the ionization equilibrium balance amounts to 0.2  dex .",
    "we found that the parameters used by israelian et al .",

    "figure  6 shows that a model similar to the one used by fk but with a gravity which is higher by 0.5  dex , is able to improve the situation considerably . with such model",
    "the difference in abundances derived from  and  lines becomes only 0.026  dex while the standard deviation from the mean abundance derived from the  lines is 0.06 .",
    "the gap between `` low '' ( @xmath70  ev ) and `` high '' ( @xmath71  ev ) excitation lines has also decreased to 0.07  dex .",
    "classical abundance determination depends on a large number of parameters .",
    "we evaluated the sensitivity of the abundances , @xmath72 , derived from the  and  lines to the uncertainties of the most important parameters .",
    "several tests showed that a change in the enhancement factor , @xmath73 , of the van der waals damping constant , @xmath74 , from 1.5 to 2.0 produces changes of less than 0.04 dex in the  abundance and can be neglected .",
    "the strongest low - excitation lines display the largest errors .",
    "the lines with equivalent widths ew @xmath75  m  are insensitive to the uncertainties in @xmath73-factors .",
    "fortunately , all  and  lines from table  5 have equivalent widths smaller than this value .",

    "our tests show that  lines with ew @xmath78  m   and @xmath79  ev are most sensitive to v@xmath76 .",
    "however , even in that case the influence of the microturbulence uncertainties could be reduced or even eliminated by using lines with ew @xmath80  m .",
    "it turned out that the change in @xmath72 corresponding to 0.35  for the  lines listed in table  6 is @xmath81  dex .",
    "thus , the influence of uncertainties in the microturbulent velocity on the abundance derived from  lines is negligibly small .",
    "the accuracy of the oscillator strengths has a strong influence on the dispersion and the mean value of the iron abundance derived from  and  lines . in our study",
    "we used for low - excitation lines ( @xmath79  ev ) mainly the oxford @xmath39 values ( @xcite , 1979b , 1980 , 1982a , 1982b , 1982c , 1984 , 1986 , 1995 ) .",

    "several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that @xmath39 values of the higher - excitation   lines that come from laboratory measurements provide likely less accurate results than those from the @xmath39 values of low - excitation lines . the use of the oscillator strengths mentioned above opened a new `` iron problem '' ( @xcite ) ` namely the behavior of the abundance derived from  lines   the excitation energy for a very large range of @xmath54 , from 0 to 7.5 ev , observed in the solar spectrum ' .",
    "the solar photospheric abundances found from the low - excitation lines using @xmath39 values of the oxford group turns out to be systematically larger than those from high - excitation lines obtained with @xmath39 measured by kiel ",
    "hannover group and by obrian et al .",
    "since @xmath39 values and abundance values enter the line extinction coefficient as a product , such behavior might be attributed to a @xmath39 systematic trend of about 0.06 dex ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another point of view is to attribute the trend to differences in the atmospheric properties of low- and high - excitation lines ( @xcite ) or both effects together ( kostik , shchukina , & rutten 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most accurate  oscillator strengths are not yet as accurate as for the  lines . following fk we used @xmath39 values obtained by bimont et al .",

    "a discussion of these and other sources of the oscillator strengths has been given recently by grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) and lambert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . the mean uncertainty in the @xmath39 values for  lines is found to be in the range @xmath1 0.050.07 dex , which corresponds to an abundance dispersion @xmath83  dex .",

    "the values @xmath66 are not very sensitive to uncertainties in collisional rates , photoionization cross - sections , continuum opacity , etc .",
    "the errors introduced by uncertainties in these parameters may lead to errors in the mean nlte abundance , @xmath66 , of about @xmath84  dex .",
    "summing up the analyses completed above , we conclude that the largest errors in the iron abundance determination using  lines are expected to be caused by neglecting the nlte effects .",
    "the largest errors in the abundance derived from  lines are caused by the uncertainties in the oscillator strengths ( if we exclude the errors in ew measurements ) . to what extent can these errors influence the stellar parameters determination for the star @xmath55 ?",
    "our computations show that the variations in @xmath29 primarily affect the abundance derived from  lines but make little difference to the abundance from  lines .",
    "abundance changes for  lines that result from a 270 k change in effective temperature are in the range @xmath85 for lte case and @xmath86 dex for nlte . in the case of  lines",
    "they are an order of magnitude smaller . on the contrary , for  lines",
    "the gravity dependence is much more pronounced , while for  lines it is negligibly small . as a result ,",
    "small errors in the  abundances can only be compensated for by large changes in the assumed gravity . or small errors in   abundances can only be fixed by large changes in the assumed effective temperature .",
    "our computations show that for the nlte @xmath66 range 0.20.35  dex obtained using  lines the correction in @xmath44 may reach @xmath3 0.5  dex in the cooler model ( @xmath87 k ) or even more in the hotter one ( @xmath88 k ) .",
    "an abundance dispersion of 0.1  dex for  lines causes dispersion of @xmath29 of 100 k. to reduce the latter effect it would be extremely desirable to enlarge the set of  lines .",
    "it is obvious that the small seven - line sample can be a source of serious troubles in stellar parameter determinations .",
    "our computations are aimed at finding the nlte solution that gives the minimum standard deviation , @xmath52 , of the mean abundance and satisfies the criteria discussed in section 5.1.1 .",
    "if we neglect the offset in abundances derived from the high - excitation ( @xmath71  ev ) and low - excitation ( @xmath70  ev ) lines , then the best model is the one displayed in figure 6 . the `` best - choice '' stellar parameters for this nlte case turn out to be @xmath90 k , @xmath91 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.66 .",
    "the top panel shows the nlte equivalent widths for the atmospheric model represented by these parameters against lte values computed for the model with parameters by fk .",
    "agreement between `` quasi - observed '' equivalent widths and those obtained in nlte is quite satisfactory .",
    "however , if the  line sample is divided into a `` low '' ( @xmath70 )  ev and `` high '' ( @xmath71 )  ev samples , the mean nlte abundances are 4.86 @xmath1 0.05 and 4.79 @xmath1 0.06 for the `` low '' and `` high '' samples , respectively .",
    "this means that even this solution can not be considered as @xmath92 given the abundance offset found for the two samples of fe lines .",
    "we could not find a model which did not show an abundance gap between `` low- '' and `` high- '' excitation lines .",
    "this failure can be attributed to our poor knowledge of the atmospheric model structures and is possible due to some 3d and/or hydrodynamical effects .",
    "this shortcoming can possibly be avoided if we concentrate our study only on the high - excitation lines with @xmath71 ev .",
    "this approach can be justified for the following reasons : a ) the high - excitation lines are sensitive to nlte effects in much less degree than low excitation ones and therefore to many uncertain factors such as overionization , granulation , geometry , etc . ;",

    "it is also possible that giants follow the linear trend just as unevolved subdwarfs , but previous investigators have failed to discover this for two main reasons ; 1 ) they did not use sufficiently high s / n ( e.g. , s / n @xmath43 400 ) to investigate uncertainties involved in the determination of oxygen abundance from the forbidden line at 6300 in the most metal - poor targets of their samples and 2 ) the stellar parameters of the most metal - poor giants were not correct because nlte effects were not taken into account",
    ". however , we can not exclude the possibility that the plateau derived from the [ oi ] in giants is correct .",
    "work is in progress to study the stellar parameters of several giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath98 by performing a nlte analysis of fe lines and investigating its impact on the oxygen abundances derived from oh , forbidden , and triplet lines .",
    "the new data in ultra - metal - poor unevolved stars confirm the previous findings for a progressive rise in oxygen overabundances as we go to [ fe / h]@xmath1042.5 . in particular , the high [ o / fe ] ratio in g64 - 12 provides evidence for enhanced oxygen production in the first nucleosynthesis events in our galaxy .",
    "can these high [ o / fe ] ratios in ultra - metal - poor stars be understood in terms of massive star nucleosynthesis models ?",
    "the first attempts to explain the linear trend were made by abia , canal , & isern ( 1991 ) , and more recently goswami & prantzos ( 2000 ) have suggested three possible scenarios to explain the observed linear trend of [ o / fe ] .",
    "the first possibility , which has already been explored in the literature , considers the early evolution of type ia sne , which started to contribute fe to the ism already in the epoch when [ fe / h ] @xmath1053.0 .",
    "goswami & prantzos ( 2000 ) remark that this model can not be accepted , as it also predicts similar linear trends for other @xmath106 elements which are not observed .",
    "however , we would like to recall that the `` traditional '' trend of @xmath106 elements ( i.e. , a unique @xmath6 at [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ) has been challenged recently by idiart & thvenin ( 2000 ) on the basis of nlte computations of @xmath106 elements .",
    "in addition , the observations indicate ( francois 1987 , 1988 ) that the [ s / fe ] ratio increases from approximately 0 to 0.7 in the metallicity range @xmath107 [ fe / h ] @xmath108 . there is",
    "no @xmath6 observed at [ fe / h ] @xmath11 , and the models fail to account for the observed [ s / fe ] ratios ( goswami & prantzos 2000 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by recent observations of takeda et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who report [ s / fe ] = 1.11 in the metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.72 ) giant hd88609 . as a second possibility ,",
    "goswami & prantzos ( 2000 ) mention the metallicity - dependent oxygen yields proposed by maeder ( 1992 ) .",
    "given that the stellar mass loss at very low metallicity is poorly understood , one can propose a model in which [ o / fe ] increases below [ fe / h ] @xmath109 , while [ @xmath106/fe ] is constant .",
    "however , goswami & prantzos ( 2000 ) argue that even this model is not acceptable , as it predicts [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] ratios increasing with [ fe / h ] ( which are not observed ) .",
    "the third model proposed by goswami & prantzos ( 2000 ) considers the possibility of having metallicity - dependent fe and @xmath106-element yields at [ fe / h ] @xmath11 .",
    "this is possible if / when the supernova layers inside the carbon - exhausted core are well mixed during the explosion ( to have [ @xmath106/fe ] @xmath3 const .",
    ", in the ejecta for any [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "this last model requires that the oxygen , carbon , and helium layers will escape with the same yields , independent on the metallicity , as they are loosely bound .",
    "note that these models did not take into account stellar rotation which plays a very important role in low - metallicity massive stars ( maeder & maynet 2000 ) .",
    "strong observational support for matter mixing , which occurs in sn ejecta during or prior to explosion comes from the analysis of the low - mass x - ray binary system nova sco 1994 ( israelian et al .",
    "if the mass of the black hole in nova sco 1994 is more than @xmath110 4 @xmath111 ( which is just a lower limit given by observations ) , then it must have `` eaten '' all fe - group elements plus the @xmath106 elements ti , ca , and s. some amount of mg and si , together with almost all the o , may escape the collapse and therefore appear in the supernova ejecta captured by the secondary .",
    "however , observations show that all @xmath106 elements are uniformly enhanced in the atmosphere of the secondary star , and that therefore there must have been some mixing in the supernova ejecta . most probably , this system is a relic of a hypernova that left a massive black hole and ejected similar amounts of @xmath106 elements ( israelian et al .",
    "1999 ; brown et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the yields from standard type ii supernovae have been investigated by a number of authors ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ; thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) .",
    "it is well known that stellar yields are influenced by metallicity .",
    "low mass - loss rates in very metal - poor massive stars lead to more massive he cores , and therefore more he is converted into oxygen ( maeder 1992 ) . in contrast , the most massive solar - metallicity stars ( @xmath112 ) go through a wolf ",
    "rayet phase where the mass loss is very efficient and end up with low - mass ( 46 @xmath111 ) he cores ( maeder & meynet 1989 ) .",
    "it is well known ( woosley 1996 ; fryer , woosley & heger 2000 ) that during the contraction phase of helium cores with @xmath113 the temperature in the center of the star gets very high ( @xmath114k ) while the density remains low .",
    "this favours the electron - positron pair instability which leads to explosive oxygen or even silicon burning .",
    "it is interesting that the pair - creation supernovae produced by stars with @xmath115 150200@xmath111 and @xmath116 lead to the formation of co cores with @xmath117 = 60100 @xmath111 .",
    "a complete thermonuclear disruption of these objects produces very large amounts of oxygen and carbon ( see figure 2 in portinari 2000 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the maximum amount of oxygen at @xmath116 is produced not by 2025 @xmath111 progenitors but by @xmath118 = 150200 @xmath111 stars ( portinari 2000 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the early ism of our galaxy has been polluted by very massive co cores of the first pair - creation supernovae .",
    "this idea is supported by qian & wasserburg ( 2000 ) , who on the basis of three - component mixing model for the evolution of o relative to fe , suggest a linear rise of [ o / fe ] if the contribution of the first very massive stars is taken into account .",
    "the stability of ultra - metal - poor very massive stars was investigated recently by baraffe , heger & woosley ( 2000 ) who concluded that such stars could take an active role in the nucleosynthesis of the early galaxy .",
    "our observations suggest that the fe production sites were active already in the early halo .",
    "recently , nomoto et al . ( 1999 ) have presented a model of an exploding co core with a mass of 1215 @xmath111 , and an explosion energy of 25 @xmath17 10@xmath119 erg in order to explain the observations of the hypernova sn1998bw .",
    "the progenitor of the co core initially had @xmath120 and large angular momentum . placing a mass cut - off at 2.9 @xmath111 nomoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have computed that 0.7 @xmath111 of @xmath121ni is ejected ; the amount required to explain observations of sn1998bw .",
    "it is possible that the linear trend can be explained by an increasing role of hypernovae in the early epochs of the formation of the galaxy ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ) .",
    "the estimated galactic rate of type ic hypernovae is @xmath122  yr@xmath19 ( hansen 1999 ) but it could have been much higher in the early galaxy .",
    "small mass - loss rates due to the low metallicity in the first generations of massive halo stars could have led to large helium cores and the conservation of the primordial angular momentum .",
    "since hypernovae are favored by stars with a large helium core mass and rapid rotation , we anticipate significant sulfur ( e.g. takeda et al . 2000 ) and iron production in the early galaxy following the yields computed by nomoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . whether the objects which started to produce large amounts of fe in the very early halo were metal - poor progenitors",
    "of the first hypernovae , very massive stars , or other types of supernovae remains to be solved by future investigations .    accelerated protons and @xmath106 particles in cosmic rays interact with ambient cno in the ism and create beryllium and boron . according to the standard galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) theory , these interactions in the general ism should have given a quadratic relation between these elements and o that is not observed .",
    "alternatively , spallation of cosmic ray cno nuclei accelerated out of freshly processed material could account for the primary character of the observed early galactic evolution of be and b. another production site is the collective acceleration by sn shocks of ejecta - enriched matter in the interiors of superbubbles . in these two cases ,",
    "the evolution of be should reflect the production of cno from massive stars .    the dependence of @xmath123",
    "( be / h ) on [ fe / h ] and on [ o / h ] is essentially linear but with different slopes : @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , and similar behavior is found for boron ( molaro et al .",

    "2000 ) , 2 ) a hybrid model based on gcr and superbubble accelerated particles ( vangioni - flam & cass 2000 ) , which could be accomplished by a pure superbubble model ( parizot & drury 2000 ) , and 3 ) standard gcr ( olive 2000 , fields & olive 1999 ) .",
