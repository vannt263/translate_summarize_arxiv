    "since the discovery of high-@xmath5 superconductivity in iron pnictides  @xcite , extensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this intriguing physical phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient for the pairing mechanism is the attractive interaction between electrons forming cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "various microscopic origins have been proposed for the pairing attraction in iron pnictides so far . in promising pairing scenarios , electronic elementary excitations such as antiferromagnetic fluctuations  @xcite and orbital fluctuations  @xcite",
    "are proposed to serve the role of mediator of the pairing .",
    "the fact that superconductivity in most of the iron - based superconductors emerges in the proximity of an antiferromagnetic transition or a structural transition gives further credence to these scenarios .",
    "it also shows that a detailed knowledge of the elementary excitations can be an essential clue to discuss pairing mechanisms .",
    "recently , resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has emerged as a powerful technique to observe various elementary excitations in solids  @xcite .",
    "particularly , rixs at the transition - metal absorption edges is useful to study the dynamics of strongly correlated @xmath2 electrons in transition - metal compounds .",
    "the type of elementary excitations that can be observed depends on the utilized absorption edge .",
    "while @xmath6-edge rixs is appropriate for studying charge dynamics , @xmath7-edge rixs enables studies of not only charge - orbital dynamics but also spin dynamics .",
    "this contrast can be attributed to the difference in the rixs intermediate state . in @xmath6-edge rixs , when the electric - dipole transition dominates the resonant transition at the main edge , an inner - shell @xmath8 electron is promoted to an empty @xmath9 state .",
    "transition - metal @xmath2 electrons near the fermi energy ( @xmath10 ) are excited to screen the @xmath8 hole with a spin - independent isotropic potential . on the other hand , in @xmath7-edge rixs ,",
    "the @xmath11 electrons are promoted to transition - metal @xmath2 bands .",
    "since the @xmath11 states split into @xmath12 doublets and @xmath13 quartets due to the strong spin - orbit coupling , the promoted electrons are polarized in spin in general .",
    "therefore magnetic excitations can be induced within the transition - metal @xmath2 bands  @xcite .",
    "when both the incoming and outgoing x - rays are linearly polarized as in usual rixs experiments , the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath2-electron system can also change in the final state , since the total angular momentum of spin and orbital is conserved .",
    "thus we should note that @xmath7-edge rixs can detect electronic excitations which @xmath6-edge rixs is insensitive to , e.g. , single - spin flip excitations and off - diagonal orbital excitations ( throughout the present article , we refer to excitations where the orbital states of the excited electron and hole are the same [ different from each other ] in the final state , as _ diagonal _ [ _ off - diagonal _ ] orbital excitations ) .",
    "@xmath7-edge rixs has indeed been widely applied to a number of copper oxides , resulting in successful observations of magnetic and orbital excitations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only fewer @xmath7-edge rixs studies have been performed for iron pnictides or chalcogenides so far , to our knowledge  @xcite .    in the iron - based superconductors ,",
    "first - principles electronic structure calculations strongly indicate that each of the fe-@xmath2 orbitals occupies a significant part of density of states ( dos ) near @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the nature of the low - energy electronic excitations is in principle quite different from that of the high-@xmath14 cuprate superconductors , in which only the cu-@xmath15 orbital is dominant near @xmath10 . in particular , it was suggested that orbital fluctuations involving the fe-@xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals could play a role in inducing the pairing in the iron pnictides  @xcite .",
    "this calls for a study of the low - energy orbital excitations in these materials using @xmath7-edge rixs .",
    "previously , jarrige , gretarsson and collaborators performed @xmath6-edge rixs of a typical superconducting iron - pnictide prfeaso@xmath0  @xcite and insulating iron chalcogenide k@xmath16fe@xmath17se@xmath18  @xcite . in both cases , the momentum dependence of the rixs spectra could be explained by assuming that the coulomb interaction between fe-@xmath2 electrons should be moderately strong , @xmath19 - 3 ev .",
    "consistency between the experiment and _ ab initio _ calculations suggested that the excitation spectra are dominated by orbital excitations with the fe-@xmath3 and @xmath4 character without any spin flip .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report @xmath7-edge rixs study for a typical iron - based superconductor , prfeaso@xmath0 .",
    "we found clearly characteristic rixs features around excitation energies of 0.5 , 1 - 1.5 and 2 - 3 ev .",
    "to interpret these features , we carried out a theoretical study based on an electronic band structure calculation .",
    "the experimental features are well captured by assuming @xmath20 ev as in the previous @xmath6-edge rixs studies  @xcite .",
    "based on the agreement with theory , we are able to assign those features to orbital excitations among fe-@xmath2 orbitals at a microscopic level . furthermore , our calculation suggests that single - magnon excitations and spin - flipped orbital excitations should appear at excitation energies below 0.5 ev , which are dispersive with respect to x - ray momentum transfer .",
    "these excitations were not observed in the present experiment , likely due to the limited energy resolution and excitation damping .",
    "remarkable splitting and merging of the lower - energy rixs peaks in momentum space are predicted , which have not been experimentally observed so far .",
    "the rixs spectra were collected at the beamline bl07su and the x - ray emission spectrometer hornet @xcite at spring-8 , japan .",
    "the total energy resolution for the rixs measurements was @xmath21230 mev at the fe-@xmath1 edge , which corresponds to a resolving power @xmath22 .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) spectra were measured in the total - fluorescence - yield ( tfy ) mode .",
    "single crystals of prfeaso@xmath0 were grown by a high - pressure synthesis method using a belt - type anvil apparatus described in ref . .",
    "the sample belongs to the so - called 1111 family , which crystallizes in the zrcusias - type structure , in the tetragonal space group @xmath23 . in this sample ,",
    "the electron doping of 0.6 is optimal and yields a @xmath14 of 42  k. the scattering geometry was chosen to minimize the intensity of the elastic peak .",
    "the spectrometer arm was placed at 90 degrees from the incident beam in the horizontal scattering plane , and incoming x - rays were always horizontally polarized , i.e. , @xmath24-polarized .",
    "all data were taken at room temperature .",
    "rixs spectra measured on prfeaso@xmath0 at a few incident x - ray energies @xmath25 across the @xmath26 edge are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the vertical offset of the rixs spectra is scaled to the energy axis of the xas spectrum . the rixs spectra display a salient feature around 1.5  ev energy loss at @xmath25=708  ev which tracks the incident energy up to @xmath21 6.5  ev at @xmath25=713  ev .",
    "this behavior is typical of fluorescence , and is observed not only in iron pnictides but also in fe metal and @xmath27-fe@xmath18o@xmath28  @xcite .",
    "we assign this peak to the @xmath29 emission line , which corresponds to the @xmath30 fluorescent decay . as the fluorescence disperses to higher energy losses ,",
    "weak features appear in its low - energy loss tail , and remain at fixed energy loss upon increase in the incident energy , around 0.5 , 1 and 2.5  ev .",
    "these rixs features are related to charge excitations , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we note that while the rixs features are very weak , such a clear observation of fe @xmath7-edge rixs excitations in a 1111 fe - based superconductor had previously not been reported in the literature to the knowledge of these authors .",
    "a close - up of the low - energy portion of the rixs spectra , with no vertical offset , is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the presence of well - defined raman - like features in the prfeaso@xmath0 data can be confirmed .",
    "we note that the lineshape and energy loss of the @xmath7-edge rixs excitations are sharply different from the @xmath6-edge data @xcite . as discussed in the next section , this is not unexpected since the spectral weight in @xmath6-edge rixs is dominated by orbital - diagonal transitions , whereas the @xmath7-edge spectral weight mostly arises from orbital off - diagonal transitions .",

    "therefore the character of the fe-@xmath2 orbitals involved in the excitation could also be different , which crucially influences the rixs response in intermediate excitation energies .",
    "the comparison with neutron scattering measurements provides an important perspective .",
    "if the spin - orbit coupling among the fe-@xmath2 electrons is weak as in most of @xmath144 transition - metal compounds , neutron scattering can only detect spin - flipped excitations without orbital change .",
    "therefore the feature a , which is predominantly an orbital off - diagonal excitation , can not effectively be observed in neutron scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "features a and b , which predominantly originate from orbital - diagonal spin - flipped excitations , can be regarded as the counterparts of spin - wave modes observed in neutron scattering .",
    "in fact , the calculated excitation energies of the feature a ( @xmath21 150 mev at @xmath145 ) are consistent with those of the spin waves observed in 122 systems using neutron scattering  @xcite , bearing in mind that direct comparisons with 122 systems should be taken with caution , as mentioned above .",
    "we would like to compare our calculation with the precedent theoretical study by kaneshita and collaborators  @xcite . while similar low - energy features to the features a and b in our study are observed in their calculated results at a sight , substantial differences",
    "can actually be found , despite the fact that both studies determined the af ground state within hfa and used the rpa .",
    "the most striking difference resides in the dominant orbital character at low energies : the @xmath146 orbital plays a dominant role for low - energy spin excitations in their calculations , while it is the @xmath76 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 orbitals in ours .",
    "this contrast most likely arises from the difference in used electronic states . in their study",
    ", the degeneracy between the @xmath73 and @xmath74 orbitals seems to be lifted  @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider that their calculation holds for the orthorhombic cases , while our calculation is valid for the tetragonal cases .",
    "another noticeable difference is the intensity of magnon excitations around @xmath138 . in their calculation ,",
    "magnon intensity vanishes at @xmath138 , while it is divergent in our calculation as shown in fig .",
    "this difference originates in the different approximation used .",
    "the so - called fast - collision approximation ( fca ) was used in their study , and consequently the rixs intensity was expressed effectively using the imaginary part of the correlation function , while we did not adopt fca in our theoretical framework .",
    "recently , igarashi and nagao discussed effects beyond fca and pointed out that symmetry breaking due to af long - range ordering can cause such a kind of divergence in rixs intensity toward @xmath138  @xcite . according to them , anisotropic terms which are not included in fca",
    "considerably enhance the spin - flip rixs intensity around @xmath147 , as seen in our calculated spectra .",
    "whether such an effect of symmetry breaking is actually observed experimentally or not is an interesting issue . to settle it , we should measure both dependences on the polarization of the ingoing and outgoing x - rays with high energy - momentum resolution , which at present requires further advancements in experimental instrumentation .    in our calculation",
    ", the long - range af ordering was assumed to be fully developed .",
    "however , this does not imply that our calculation is applicable only to the af ordering state below the nel temperature .",
    "the rixs process occurs on a femtosecond timescale , amply short compared with usual spin dynamics .",
    "in addition , the length scale , which can be estimated to be the product of the time scale and the velocity of electrons or elementary excitations , is very short compared with the usual af magnetic correlation length .",
    "therefore we may approximately regard spins as almost frozen with the magnetic configuration during the rixs process , which can be treated within hfa .",
    "we can expect that our calculation becomes more valid at low temperatures where tetragonal symmetry is still maintained but the af correlation has evolved into critically slow spin fluctuations and sufficiently long - range correlation length .",
    "comparison with the copper oxides is quite illuminating . in the copper oxides , spin excitations , @xmath100 orbital excitations , and charge - transfer excitations",
    "are observed separately in a different excitation energy range  @xcite . on the other hand , in the iron - pnictides , spin excitations and @xmath100",
    "orbital excitations are overlapped and entangled in the low - energy region .",
    "this notable contrast arises from the following differences in electronic states between these two kinds of compounds : firstly , in the copper oxides , the cu-@xmath15 level is partially filled and well separated from the other completely filled cu-@xmath2 orbitals by crystalline - field energies which are larger than the spin excitation energy . therefore interference between spin excitations and @xmath100 excitations are suppressed .",
    "in contrast , in the iron - pnictides , all of the five fe-@xmath2 states are partially filled and @xmath100 orbital excitations are allowed even in the low - energy range where spin excitations occur .",
    "secondly , @xmath100 orbital excitations in the iron pnictides are rather broad , while they emerge as well - resolved sharp peaks in the copper oxides . as naturally understood , the sharpness of the @xmath100 orbital excitations reflects the strength of localization of the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "in fact , the @xmath100 excitations in the copper oxides have been well described by the single - ion crystal field model  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath100 excitations in the copper oxides are strongly localized .",
    "in contrast to the copper oxides , an itinerant description seems to be more appropriate for the 1111 iron - pnictide system .",
    "the itinerancy of the fe-@xmath2 electrons in the iron pnictides has been argued based on discussions on the origin of the sdw ordering  @xcite .",
    "our present study is consistent with those arguments , since the observed features b , c and d are broad @xmath100 excitations which can be appropriately described by using an itinerant model and be regarded as fe-@xmath2 interband transitions . thus the multi - orbital nature and relatively strong itinerancy of the fe-@xmath2 electrons",
    "are responsible for the entanglement and overlapping of the low - energy spin and orbital excitations in the iron pnictides .",
    "in summary , we reported fe @xmath7-edge rixs measurements on a typical iron pnictide , prfeaso@xmath0 .",
    "well - resolved rixs features were observed around 0.5 , 1 - 1.5 , 2 - 3 ev .",
    "the underlying excitation processes were investigated theoretically on the basis of first - principle electronic bands , and interpreted as orbital excitations among the fe-@xmath2 orbitals . a low - energy 0.25 ev feature , likely hidden by the elastic tail in the experiment , was theoretically predicted and assigned to spin - flipped orbital excitations with strong @xmath3 and @xmath4 components .",
    "consistency between the experiment and calculation confirmed that the coulomb interaction among fe-@xmath2 orbitals is moderately strong ( @xmath148 3 ev ) in this system .",
    "furthermore , momentum dependence of the rixs features below 0.5 ev was predicted , with remarkable splitting and merging of the lower - energy peaks in momentum space .",
    "pending improvements in instrumental energy and momentum resolution in the next generation of rixs spectrometers should enable experimental confirmation of these low - energy features and their behavior , which could not be observed in the present experiment .",
    "finally , the contrast between these @xmath7-edge data and previously reported @xmath6-edge data on the same systems highlights the benefit of a combinatorial study using both edges ; @xmath6 edge to probe diagonal @xmath100 interband transitions and ligand - to - metal charge transfer , @xmath7 edge to probe off - diagonal @xmath100 interband transitions and spin excitations .",
