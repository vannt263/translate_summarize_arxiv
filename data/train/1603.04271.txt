    "a non - trivial quantum measurement necessarily perturbs the initial state of the measured system .",
    "hence , subsequent measurements on the same system are typically disturbed compared to the situation without the first measurement . despite the unavoidable measurement disturbance",
    ", we can still hope to learn more about the initial state of the system by performing measurements in sequence .",
    "for instance , by measuring sequentially unsharp versions of conjugated observables , we can implement any covariant phase space observable , hence also an informationally complete observable @xcite,@xcite .",
    "properties of sequential measurements can also be used to study quantum foundations .",
    "for instance , the demand for the existence of a sequential product on an effect algebra excludes certain types of unphysical effect algebras @xcite,@xcite .",
    "given that a sequential measurement of two different observables can give more information than the independent measurements of the same observables , then how useful can a repetition of the same measurement on the same system be ?",
    "a repetition of a von neumann measurement just gives the same outcome every time and , since all the potential of the measurement is thus used already after the first step , there is no reason to measure such an observable more than once .",
    "however , quantum observables generally also allow less invasive measurements , so we may ask how useful repeating the same measurement can be and after how many repetitions the full potential of the measurement setup is reached .",
    "in the present work , we study repeated applications of the same measurement device and compare different numbers of repetition .",
    "such a scheme of quantum non - demolishion measurements has been proposed in a quantum optical setting @xcite and has also been performed experimentally @xcite .",
    "repeated measurements and interactions between the system and a chain of probes has also been studied , e.g. ,  in @xcite and @xcite with an emphasis on asymptotic behaviour of the system state in the latter reference . to properly understand the amount of classical information retrievable from the system through a repeated measurement",
    ", we define the _ saturation step _ to be the least number of repetitions of the measurement after which we obtain no added information .",
    "we discuss cases when a single application of the measurement gives all the information that can be extracted by repetition , but also cases when the saturation step is finite but greater than one .    using the techniques developed recently in @xcite , we give a precise meaning for a measurement that is repeated infinite number of times .",
    "our most surprising finding is that , in some repeated measurement setups , saturation is never reached after finitely many steps but , in the limit of infinitely many repetitions , we may correct the inherent noise of the original observable produced by a single application of the measurement process .",
    "we show that this is the case for the lders measurement of a binary observable ( apart from trivial cases ) , and we find that the infinite consecutive lders measurement is equivalent with the minimal sharp observable associated with it .",
    "a measurement can be described at different levels .",
    "if we are only interested in measurement outcome probabilities , description at the level of observables suffices . if we , in addition , discuss conditional state transformation caused by the measurement",
    ", then the relevant concept is that of an instrument .",
    "we start by recalling the mathematical definitions of these two concepts . for more details",
    ", we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    _",
    "notation_. in the rest of the paper @xmath0 is a fixed hilbert space .",
    "the dimension of @xmath0 can be either finite or countably infinite .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the set of all bounded operators on @xmath0 .",
    "a quantum observable with finite number of outcomes is described by a map @xmath2 from a finite set @xmath3 to @xmath1 such that each @xmath4 is a positive operator and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the identity operator on @xmath0 .",
    "an observable @xmath7 is called _ sharp _ if each operator @xmath4 is a projection .",
    "since we need to compare two observables , we recall the following _ post - processing preorder _ of observables @xcite . given two observables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we denote @xmath9 if there exists a map @xmath10 $ ] such that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",

    "relabelings _ , where we relabel the measurement outcomes , possibly giving the same label for different outcomes and hence merging them , but doing nothing else . if we start from an outcome space @xmath20 , a relabeling is determined by a function @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding markov kernel @xmath22 is then @xmath23 and the post - processed observable is @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25    the post - processing preorder @xmath26 can be used to compare the information - yielding power of observables : if @xmath9 with @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 and a markov kernel @xmath27 as in , measuring @xmath8 gives us at least as much information on the system as measuring @xmath7 does . indeed ,",
    "if we measure @xmath8 , we obtain the outcome statistics of @xmath7 , i.e. ,  the probabilities @xmath28}$ ] of detecting the value @xmath29 through classical data processing represented by the kernel @xmath27 from the outcome statistics of @xmath8 _ independent of the system state @xmath30 _ since @xmath31 thus we may say that , if @xmath9 , then @xmath8 is at least as informative as @xmath7 . naturally , we interpret @xmath15 to mean that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are informationally equivalent ; we may measure either of them and obtain the same amount of classical information .",

    "as we use the heisenberg picture , this is reflected in the transformation of observables . if we measure first @xmath37 and then some other observable @xmath8 on the same system , we obtain measurement outcomes @xmath29 and @xmath39 with the probability @xmath40}$ ] .",
    "if we perform subsequently more than two measurements , then we need to form a composition of instruments @xcite,@xcite .",

    "we will now consider a repeated measurement scheme where we use the same measurement device repeatedly on the same system ( fig .",
