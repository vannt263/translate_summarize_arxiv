    "the study of ultrashort magnetic phenomena has been largely driven by their application to magnetic storage technologies , which are rapidly evolving towards the nanoscale and sub - picosecond regimes , giving rise to significant advances in the understanding of magnetization dynamics @xcite .",
    "currently , no easily accessible method is available to generate intense sub - picosecond magnetic pulses localized at the nanoscale .",
    "short electron pulses can be tightly focused and are accompanied by magnetic fields of a few teslas , but they require access to electron accelerators @xcite .",
    "transient magnetization has been also studied via the inverse faraday effect in cases for which absorption of circularly polarized light leads to a prevailing spin species @xcite , although this technique is only applicable to highly absorbing materials exhibiting strong spin - orbit coupling , with spatial resolution limited by the light focal spot . here ,",
    "we propose a radically new approach towards ultrafast magnetism with nanoscale resolution relying on optically driven generation of magnetic fields .    in this work , we show that bimetallic nanorings can act as nanoscale sources of intense ultrashort magnetic pulses .",
    "we rely on the enhanced light absorption associated with the plasmons of metallic rings to generate transient thermoelectric currents that in turn produce sub - picosecond pulses with magnetic fields as high as a few tenths of a tesla in the vicinity of the rings .",
    "the ability to generate strong magnetic fields localized on the nanoscale is of interest for elucidating spin and magnetization dynamics at sub - picosecond time and nanometer length scales @xcite , and it holds great potential for materials characterization , terahertz radiation generation , and magnetic recording .",
    "a scheme of our magnetic source is shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath0fs laser pulse heats a bimetalic ring consisting of three quadrants of gold and one quadrant of nickel .",
    "this choice of materials is a compromise between their thermoelectric response and their electrical resistance in order to optimize the resulting magnetic field .",
    "the ring is @xmath0 nm thick , has inner ( outer ) diameter of @xmath1 nm ( @xmath2 nm ) , and is embedded in glass .",
    "the incident pulse is polarized along one of the au / ni junctions ( b in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and is centered at a wavelength of @xmath3 nm , which corresponds to the lowest - order dipole plasmon resonance of the ring . in a homogeneous gold ring",
    ", symmetry would lead to resonant absorption at two diametrically opposed regions .",
    "however , the asymmetry of the bimetallic ring polarization leads to stronger absorption near one of the au / ni junctions ( a in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "this nonuniform absorption produces a steep gradient of the electron temperature along the ring , and consequently , a net displacement of charge carriers occurs from hotter to colder regions , giving rise to a seebeck electromotive force . in the au / ni thermocouple charge carriers in gold and nickel are electrons and holes , respectively , so that the resulting thermoelectric current contributes along the same direction on either side of each metal junction @xcite .",
    "femtosecond pulses give rise to temperature differences of several thousand degrees in the conduction electron gas .",
    "this results in a strong thermoelectric current before thermalization into the atomic lattice takes place within a few picoseconds . finally , this transient circular current generates a magnetic field , mainly perpendicular to the plane of the ring ( green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "we solve the underlying nonlinear heat - transfer / thermoelectric / electromagnetic problem within the two - temperature model @xcite using a commercial finite - elements tool ( comsol ) , and we supplement these results with a semi - analytical model that correctly predicts the magnitude of the generated field and its duration ( see appendix  [ semianalytical ] for more details ) .    ) and lattice ( @xmath4 ) temperatures at the hot ( solid red , a ) and cold ( dashed blue , b ) junctions of the ring .",
    "the pulse fluence is @xmath5j / m@xmath6 and evolves as shown by the dotted curve .",
    "a snapshot of the electron temperature on the ring surface is shown in the inset at the time corresponding to the maximum of @xmath7 in the hot junction a.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the time evolution of the conduction - electron ( @xmath7 ) and lattice ( @xmath4 ) temperatures at the two au / ni junctions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for an incident pulse fluence of @xmath5j / m@xmath6 , which transfers @xmath8pj to the ring ( absorption cross - section @xmath9m@xmath6 , see appendix  [ opticalheating ] ) . following an initial excitation with the ultrafast optical pulse , the electron - gas temperature rapidly rises at both junctions , reaching peak values shortly after the maximum of the incident pulse .",
    "the nickel section of the ring produces a considerable temperature difference between the two junctions : electrons at the hot junction ( a ) reach a peak temperature of @xmath10k , which is approximately twice the temperature of the cold junction electrons ( b ) .",
    "the peak temperature at b occurs nearly 1ps after the maximum of a as a result of hot - electron diffusion . over this short time interval ,",
    "the absorbed energy remains almost entirely in the electron gas , while thermalization of the gold and nickel lattices , initially at @xmath11k , takes place over a time scale of several picoseconds .",
    "the lattice and electron temperatures become nearly identical @xmath12ps after irradiation , when both junctions are at @xmath13k , well below the melting temperature of the ring materials .",
    "finally , the ring cools back to room temperature after a few nanoseconds due to diffusion through the surrounding glass .",
    "the decay from maximum heating reveals three different time scales : a fast decay ( @xmath14ps ) produced by thermal diffusion within the electron gases of the two metals ; an intermediate decay ( @xmath12ps ) that can be ascribed to thermalization of the electrons into the lattice via electron - phonon scattering ; and a slow decay ( @xmath15nanoseconds ) arising from thermalization into the surrounding glass .",
    "this picture is consistent with the temperature dependence of the involved materials parameters ( see methods ) .",
    "the temperature gradient between two junctions of metals with different seebeck coefficients produces an electromotive force that drives a thermoelectric current along the ring circumference . for uniformly heated junctions",
    ", this effect is quantified through a potential between them @xmath16 , proportional to the temperature difference @xmath17 .",
    "the seebeck coefficient @xmath18 depends on the nature of the material between the two junctions , as well as on temperature ( see appendix  [ ethparam ] ) . because of the high electron temperatures involved , the thermoelectric current density in the confined ring geometry reaches values as high as @xmath19a / m@xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a ( left scale ) illustrates the temporal evolution of the current density through junction a , which follows quite closely the temperature difference , with a maximum occurring @xmath20fs after the peak of the excitation pulse .",
    "the current distribution on the ring surface ( fig .  [ fig3]b ) reveals a dominant azimuthal component , except near the hot junction , where parasitic short - range loops are produced .",
    "these strong currents give rise to a large magnetic induction ( @xmath21 t peak value ) of similar temporal profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , right scale ) .",
    "the induction is localized inside the ring cavity ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) , where it is rather uniform ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , inset ) , with the exception of a depletion caused by the noted loop currents in the hot au / ni junction .",
    "the magnetic pulse has a duraction @xmath22ps fwhm , mainly controlled by electron diffusion and thermalization into the lattice ( see methods ) .",
    "the peak magnetic induction grows monotonically with light - pulse fluence ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , exhibiting a slightly sublinear behavior as a result of the increase in electron heat capacity with temperature @xcite , although the net effect involves a complex interplay between the temperature dependence of the materials thermal and electrical parameters ( see methods ) .",
    "we have formulated a simple model that yields semi - analytical expressions for the peak magnetic induction ( eq .  ( [ b ] ) ) and the magnetic pulse duration ( eq .  ( [ duration ] ) ) , as discussed in appendix  [ semianalytical ] .",
    "the model is based upon the neglect of thermal diffusion in the lattice and it assumes that the optical pulse acts as a sudden impulse .",
    "this produces results in excellent agreement with full numerical simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , thus providing a simple tool that can assist in the design of rings optimized in size and composition to yield the desired levels of magnetic pulse intensity and duration .",
    "in particular , the model predicts a magnetic field duration that increases with optical pulse fluence , which essentially reflects the decrease in electron - phonon coupling and the increase in the heat capacity associated with the ever larger electron temperature that is reached with higher pumping intensities ( see appendix  [ ethparam1 ] ) .     and",

    ". this can be the basis of a new source of optically pumped thz radiation , whereby illuminated rings act as localized magnetic dipoles . in a different , important range of applications ,",
    "illuminated bimetallic rings provide an interesting opportunity for nanoscale magnetic recording triggered by the intense magnetic field ( strongly confined in the @xmath30 nm ring cavity ) in combination with suitable magnetic grain sizes that can react to the short duration of the magnetic pulse @xcite . as a practical consideration ,",
    "the main limitation on the values of the achievable magnetic field comes from the breakdown current in the rings ( @xmath31a@xmath32m@xmath6 for gold @xcite ) , as well as from possible melting of the metals @xcite .",
    "however , the short duration of the optical irradiation , the moderate lattice temperatures involved , and the embedding of the ring in a rigid glass matrix should push the thresholds for melting and electrical breakdown well beyond the currents and temperatures considered here .    in conclusion , we have shown that a bimetallic nanoring illuminated by ultrafast laser pulses supports transient thermoelectric currents leading to magnetic pulses of sub - picosecond duration reaching a fraction of a tesla and localized in the @xmath30 nm ring cavity .",

    "our simulations of optically induced generation of magnetic fields mediated by thermoelectric currents in bimetallic rings involve solving a set of coupled equations for ( 1 ) the electromagnetic field intensity of the incident light , ( 2 ) the heat diffusion problem , ( 3 ) the resulting thermoelectric current , and ( 4 ) the magnetic field itself . in this work ,",
    "we provide two levels of theory based upon ( i ) full numerical simulations and ( ii ) semi - analytical modeling .",

    "( 1 ) light - pulse absorption by the ring . *",
    "light absorption is calculated by solving maxwell s equations for a gaussian pulse of @xmath33fs duration centered at a wavelength of @xmath3 nm and incident on the ring along its axis with linear polarization as shown in fig .",
    "because the pulse duration is much longer than the light period ( 3.1fs ) , the absorbed power density ( i.e. , the position- and time - dependent power absorbed per unit volume inside the ring ) is approximated as @xmath34 , assuming that it follows the pulse temporal profile @xmath35 $ ] , multiplied by the peak absorption density @xmath36 , which we calculate for a plane wave with the same intensity as the pulse maximum .",
    "the dielectric functions of gold ( @xmath37 ) , nickel ( @xmath38 ) , and glass ( 2.1 ) are taken from tabulated optical data @xcite .    *",
    "( 2 ) thermal diffusion and temperature distribution . *",
    "the absorbed power density @xmath39 acts as the source of heat for the thermal diffusion problem .",
    "we adopt a two - temperature model @xcite , in which the conduction - electron and atomic - lattice subsystems have their own temperatures @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , each of them evolving over very different time scales .",
    "we assume that the heating produced through @xmath39 is entirely transferred from the light to the conduction electrons , which reach local thermal equilibrium in a short time compared with the characteristic times for thermal diffusion and lattice thermalization ( see below ) .",
    "the thermal diffusion equation is then simultaneously solved for the electronic and lattice subsystems , which are coupled through a term accounting for heat transfer from the former to the latter .",
    "we assume this term to be proportional to the local temperature difference @xmath42 , via an electron - phonon coupling coefficient @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the two coupled diffusion equations @xcite    [ heat ] @xmath43 @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath23 are the electron and lattice heat capacities , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the respective thermal conductivities .",
    "we use values of the temperature - dependent coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath26 for ni and au compiled from refs .",

    "at which a large magnetic field is generated , we have @xmath62ps and @xmath63ps ( see appendix  [ opticalheating ] ) , in front of which we neglect @xmath64fs , and thus we consider the pulse to deliver an instantaneous impulse quantified by an absorbed energy density @xmath65 .",
    "this determines the maximum local electron temperature @xmath7 right after pulse irradiation by imposing @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the initial room temperature before irradiation .    *",
    "( ii ) neglect of the lattice . * upon examination of the physical parameters entering eqs .",
    "( [ heat ] ) ( see appendices  [ ethparam1 ] and [ ethparam ] ) , we observe that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , that is , the lattice takes much more heat to increase its temperate than the electron gas and it conducts heat more poorly .",
