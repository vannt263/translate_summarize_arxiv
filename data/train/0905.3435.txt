    "residual paramagnetic impurities in ultra - pure hemex sapphire crystals greatly influence the electromagnetic properties of the resonators cooled to near liquid helium temperature .",
    "for example , the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) of impurities such as cr@xmath0 , ti@xmath0 and mo@xmath0 , influence the temperature dependence and allow frequency - temperature turnover ( annulment ) near liquid helium temperature , which can vary between 2 to 10 k@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is vital to produce ultra - stable frequencies for cryogenic sapphire oscillators@xcite and the study of epr in low - loss crystals has become an important topic of investigation@xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the small amount of residual fe@xmath0 ions ( less than parts per million ) are sufficient to create maser oscillations due to the zero - field 3-level system between @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 spin states@xcite .",
    "this has allowed a new way to operate a cryogenic sapphire oscillator , where population inversion is created by pumping the spin states in the @xmath1 transition to the @xmath4 transitions with a 31.3 ghz pump , and has the potential to operate with a frequency stability governed by the schawlow - townes noise limit@xcite ( sub @xmath5 frequency stability ) .    in this work",
    "we show how the application of an axial magnetic field on a cryogenic sapphire resonator , with a mode tuned on the fe@xmath0 epr , adds a gyrotropic component of magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this is achieved due to the very high - q whispering gallery ( wg ) modes ( of order @xmath6 ) that are excited , which enables the discrimination of the two degenerate standing wave modes known as a doublet .",
    "precision measurement of the frequency and q - factor of the doublet reveals an asymmetric response , which demonstrates that the susceptibility added by the magnetic field is predominately of gyrotropic origin and that the modes transform to traveling waves .",
    "traveling waves are known to enhance the interaction between the pump radiation and the maser medium due to the elimination of standing wave nodes , and should be a way of generating greater output power in the respective solid - state maser .",
    "to determine the electromagnetic fields of the mode under investigation we use a separation of variables technique , which has proved to be reliable for the approximate calculation of electromagnetic fields and properties of high - q wg modes in low loss sapphire resonators@xcite . to calculate the gyrotropic properties we apply perturbation analysis on the non - gyrotropic fields",
    "the technique assumes the resonator is a perfect cylinder of uniaxial anisotropy with the c - axis aligned along the cylinder z - axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] .    for electromagnetic modes exisiting in non - gyrotropic media with one or more azimuthal variations ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "two degenerate mode solutions exist ( doublet ) as orthogonal displaced standing wave solutions proportional to either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the degeneracy of the modes is lifted by a very small amount ( only observable in high - q systems ) due to dielectric backscatter or other perturbations , which couple the counter clockwise ( ccw , @xmath10 ) or clockwise ( cw , @xmath11 ) parts between the two doublet standing wave modes@xcite . in gyrotropic media ,",
    "the doublets have their degeneracy further modified in a non - reciprocal fashion , and the modes must transform to the travelling wave basis ( rather than standing wave ) with opposite elliptical polarization due to the non - reciprocity imposed by the gyrotropic effect@xcite .    in this work we observe gyrotropic effects on a quasi - transverse magnetic ( tm ) wg doublet pair , which is represented by the notation , wgh@xmath12 . here @xmath13 the number of radial zero crossings and @xmath14 the number of axial zero crossings and the @xmath15 symbol represents the sense of the elliptical polarization of the doublets . for the fundamental wgh@xmath16 mode family",
    "the e@xmath17 electric field is the dominant component and is symmetric along the z - axis ( around z = 0 ) .",
    "given these conditions one can show that the solutions to maxwell s equations yield ( the time dependence @xmath18 is assumed ) : @xmath19 to calculate the other components we apply the following maxwell s relationships to the z - components given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : maxwellsolution1 ] ) in the regions 1 , 2 and 3 ( derived from maxwell s equations in cylindrical co - ordinates ) .    [ eqn:2 ] @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    here , @xmath24 11.349 and @xmath25 9.272 , are the uniaxial permittivity components of sapphire cooled close to liquid helium temperature ( @xmath265 k ) parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis respectively .",
    "the mode pair that we are interested in is the wgh@xmath27 inside a sapphire crystal of 50 mm diameter and 30 mm height at room temperature .",
    "contraction from room temperature to 5 k is taken into account in the modelling by the factors of 0.99927 along the z - axis and 0.99939 perpendicular to the z - axis@xcite .",
    "matching boundary conditions with the same approximations as given in@xcite , we obtain the following values of the parameters as shown in table [ tab : table1 ] ; note that initially no gyrotropic effects are assumed ( the effects are small and perturbation analysis suffices ) .",

    "the lifting of the degeneracy is caused by reactive coupling through the electromagnetic fields ( strong coupling ) , which creates a band gap between the modes .",
    "the frequency of the upper and lower modes with respect to a linear tuning parameter , @xmath29 , are in general given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fvsx ] ) .",
    "@xmath30 here the frequencies of the travelling waves @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend linearly on the tuning parameter @xmath29 , with a tuning coefficient of @xmath33 respectively , an idealized diagram with respect to coupled mode theory with @xmath34 , is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : figure4 ] and [ fig : figure5 ] shows the mode frequencies tuning as a function of magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field tunes the frequencies due to the tuning of the epr , however the tuning is non - linear . given that the non - gyrotropic response of the epr to the magnetic field should be in the linear regime , as the magnetic fields are relatively small@xcite we may define the average frequency shift of the two modes as an effective linear tuning parameter , such that @xmath37 .",

    "the esr is inhomogenously broadened so the interaction will be with the spin packet of closest frequency in both sapphires .",
    "sapphire 2 has a lower threshold of about 0.6 gauss compared to sapphire 1 with 4 gauss .",
    "the threshold value basically corresponds to the value of magnetic field that the standing waves are transformed to travelling waves and the point where the mode responds linearly to tuning parameter @xmath29 with the value of @xmath40 for the tuning coefficient .",
    "the threshold magnetic field value also correlates with the value of the coupling strength between the travelling waves with the higher value demanding a stronger coupling .",
    "thus , the more tightly coupled the travelling waves the stronger the magnetic field threshold that is required to transform them into travelling waves .",
    "the doublet splitting at zero - field is of order @xmath41 , which is more than two orders of magnitude than the coupling parameter measured in this work .",
    "however , this splitting is most likely due to the non - perfect cylindrical radius .",
    "once the modes transform to standing waves they sample orthogonal space along the azimuthal dimension and will `` see '' a different effective radius . only a difference of 2.5 @xmath42 m over the 25 mm radius is required to account for this .",
    "the hypothesis is supported by the fact that the tolerance of the radial circumference in the machining process given by the manufacture is @xmath43 @xmath42 m .",
    "the contribution to the magnetic susceptibility ( or permeability ) of the electron paramagnetic resonance of fe@xmath0 ions in sapphire at 12.03 ghz ( between spin states @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) with respect to a dc axial magnetic field has been measured from precision measurements of q - factor and frequency of a whispering gallery mode doublet pair at 4.2 k. the form of the susceptibility was shown to be predominantly gyrotropic causing non - reciprocal response of the measured resonant modes .",
