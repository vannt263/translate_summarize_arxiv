    "modern states and societies can only function if the necessary infrastructures are continuously available and fully operative .",
    "critical infrastructures are organizations or facilities of key importance to public interest whose failure or impairment could result in detrimental supply shortages , substantial disturbance to public order or economic impact .",
    "the theory of complex networks is increasingly being exploited to tackle those sorts of issues . for a comprehensive review on complex networks we refer to @xcite .",
    "examples of applications include facilities for electricity generation , transmission and distribution , oil and gas production , telecommunication , water supply , agriculture ( food production and distribution ) , public health ( hospital , ambulances ) , transportation systems ( fuel supply , railways , airports , harbors ) , financial and security services @xcite-@xcite . due to their importance ,",
    "a crucial issue is learning how to improve the tolerance of critical infrastructure to failures and attacks .",
    "a line of research investigating issues of flow and transportation in complex networks is under active development @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a major threat for the proper functioning of power networks is that of large blackouts that may involve big cities or even portions of states .",
    "traditionally such occurrences were caused by accidental faults and thus were quite rare ; however , in recent years power systems , as well as other critical infrastructures , have become a potential target for intentional attacks .",
    "the main difference is that malicious attacks may not be random but rather directed specifically to the most sensitive parts of the system , in terms of the impact they can cause .",
    "thus , most of the applications of complex network concepts to power systems are aimed at understanding the behavior of power grids both in case of accidental failures and of malicious attacks @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the tolerance of a network to failures is normally intended as the ability of the network to maintain its connectivity properties after the deletion of a fraction of its nodes or lines . in this way",
    "the problem can be mapped into a standard percolation problem , of the type extensively studied in statistical physics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , a pure connectivity approach , which may be suitable for instance in the case of the world wide web , does not seem to catch most of the crucial features of a power network . in general a power network can indeed undergo severe damages even without any inverse percolation taking place ; on the contrary , it can happen that some less important nodes become isolated , thus changing the connectivity of the network , without strongly affecting its global performance .",
    "a parameter introduced to evaluate the tolerance of complex networks to outages is the _ efficiency _ @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we further develop this concept and propose a new parameter to evaluate the performance of a power grid , which we name _ net - ability_. the new definition takes into account some peculiar features of electrical networks such as the flow limits and the power flow allocation through the network , due to the inherent physical laws .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ efvul ] we review the definition of efficiency pointing out its meaning in relation to power grids . in section [ netab ]",
    "we introduce the definition of net - ability . in section [ case ]",
    "we provide examples of the application of net - ability to evaluate the static tolerance to outages of a few sample networks .",
    "comparison between efficiency and net - ability is finally provided .",
    "general conclusions and comments are provided in section [ concl ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix we recall some basic notions about power systems analysis used in the paper .",
    "as a preliminary step , let us briefly recall the definition of geodesic distance commonly used in the literature on complex networks .",
    "let us start considering an un - weighted graph : the number of lines in a path connecting nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is called the length of the path .",
    "a geodesic path ( or shortest path ) between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the path connecting these nodes with minimum length .",
    "the length of the geodesic path is the _",
    "geodesic distance _",
    "@xmath2 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if one is dealing with a weighted graph , the length of a path is the sum of the weights of the lines constituting that path .    the _ global efficiency _ @xmath3 of a network was first introduced by latora and marchiori @xcite as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of nodes of the network and @xmath2 is the geodesic distance between the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ;",
    "the sum is taken over all pairs of nodes of the network .",
    "the global efficiency is a measure of the performance of the network , under the assumption that the efficiency for sending information between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is proportional to the reciprocal of their distance .    in many networks",
    "it happens that some nodes and lines are more important than others . while naively one would say that the most important nodes are those with the highest degree @xcite , for large networks it is often non trivial to find out which are the components that actually are most critical for the performance of the network . since the efficiency has been associated with the performance of the network , a natural way to find critical components of a network",
    "is by looking for the nodes or lines whose removal causes the biggest drops in efficiency . the _ vulnerability _",
    "@xmath6 of a line @xmath7 can be defined as the drop in the performance when the line @xmath7 is removed from the network @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath3 is the global efficiency of the network and @xmath9 is the global efficiency after the removal of the line @xmath7 . when a node is removed , all the lines attached to the node are removed as well .    a definition of network vulnerability is the maximum vulnerability of all its nodes @xcite : @xmath10    the general definition of vulnerability , eq .",
    "( [ vuln ] ) as a drop in the efficiency can be usefully applied also to power networks . however , when applied to power grids , some problems arise with the definition of efficiency given by eq .",
    "( [ topeff ] ) .    specifically , the efficiency defined by eq .",
    "( [ topeff ] ) shows three main problems when applied to power grids .",
    "* in electrical circuits power does not flow from a node @xmath0 to another node @xmath1 along a single specific path ( for instance the geodesic path ) , but rather along all the paths connecting @xmath0 to @xmath1 according to the power flow ; see the appendix for a simplified method to solve the power flow equations .",
    "therefore the classical idea of geodesic distance is not suited for power grids and a different concept of distance needs to be introduced . * in the eq .",
    "( [ topeff ] ) the sum is taken over all pair of nodes .",
    "however in electrical circuits power flows only from generation to load nodes , so only distances between generator - load pairs should be taken into account . * for each pair @xmath11 of generation and load nodes , the network has a different transfer capability @xmath12 in transmitting power .",
    "suppose we increase the power injection at node @xmath0 until the first line reaches its line flow limit : @xmath12 is equal to the power injection in that moment .",
    "in the same spirit of the efficiency described in the previous section , the net - ability of a power transmission grid is defined as a measure of its performance under normal operating conditions .",
    "the function of a power transmission network is to transmit a time dependent amount of power from generation nodes to load nodes in the most convenient technical and economic way .",
    "the economic issues are related to transmission costs and economic efficiency ( social surplus ) of the underlying market , while the technical issues refer to losses , voltage drop and stability .",
    "the actual ability of a power transmission grid to perform properly depends on its topological structure and on the impedance and flow limits of its lines .",
    "the concept of distance @xmath2 may be explained as the difficulty to transfer the relevant quantity between the nodes @xmath11 of a network .",
    "distance in general depends on the path that one follows and thus should be defined as a function of the characteristics of the lines along the path .",
    "the economic and technical difficulties for transmission of electrical power through a path depend on both the power flow through the lines and on their impedance : with the same impedance , higher power flow increases costs ; with the same power flow , higher impedance increases costs .",
    "consequently , the distance from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 along path @xmath13 is related not only to the impedance of each line of the path but also to the power flows through the lines of the path . as a result",
    ", we define the electrical distance as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the power transmission distribution factor of line @xmath7 in path @xmath13 and @xmath16 its impedance ( see eq .",
    "( [ ptdf ] ) in the appendix for details ) .    on account of the eq .",
    "( [ eldist ] ) , we propose the following definition for the net - ability of a power transmission grid : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the sets of generator and load nodes respectively , while @xmath20 is the set of paths from generator @xmath0 to load @xmath1 ; likewise @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total numbers of generators and loads respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath23 is the power share of path @xmath13 in transmitting power from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "let us stress that the definition of distance given in the eq .",
    "( [ eldist ] ) is referred to a specific path .",
    "there is not the concept of geodesic distance or shortest path here , in principle all the paths are to be taken into account separately .",
    "let us call @xmath24 the equivalent impedance of the circuit whose ends are node @xmath0 and node @xmath1 ; @xmath25 is the voltage between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath26 is the current injected at node @xmath0 and extracted at node @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ zeqfig ] the equivalent impedance is defined as @xmath28 furthermore , let @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 ( meaning that a unit current is injected at node @xmath0 and extracted at @xmath1 , while no current is extracted nor injected in other nodes ) , then the computation of equivalent impedance is sketched in fig .",
    "[ zeqfig ] and amounts to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath0-th , @xmath1-th element of the impedance matrix , see the appendix .    in the following electrical networks",
    "are analyzed using a dc model . for a discussion of the reasons to choose a dc rather than an ac model ,",
    "see the appendix . in a dc power flow model",
    "the distance @xmath35 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eldist ] ) is equal to the variation of voltage angle between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , when 1 unit of active power is injected at @xmath0 and collected at @xmath1 . since in the dc power flow model the variation of voltage angle",
    "is considered as the equivalent dc voltage and the active power is considered as the current , @xmath35 for any involved path between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equal to the equivalent impedance of the circuit whose ends are @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath36 again , the expression of the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqimp ] ) is not related to a specific path , since it takes into account all the existing paths between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ eltdist ]    substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqimp ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ neta1 ] ) and keeping in mind that : @xmath37 we obtain : @xmath38    in analogy with the expression of the vulnerability given by eq .",
    "( [ vuln ] ) , we define the vulnerability of line @xmath7 as the net - ability drop caused by an outage ( cut ) of the line @xmath7 : @xmath39",
    "in this section we use the two definitions , given by eqs .",
    "( [ vuln ] ) and ( [ wuln ] ) , to estimate the line vulnerability of ieee sample networks @xcite , made of 30 and 57 nodes .",
    "for each case , the results obtained from _ efficiency _ and _ net - ability _ are compared with the _ overload rate _ ,",
    "defined following @xcite .",
    "the overload in an electrical network is given by :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the power flow through line @xmath7 calculated by the dc load flow model ( see the appendix ) , @xmath42 is the flow limit of line @xmath7 and the sum is taken over the set @xmath43 of lines in the network .",
    "we are interested in the sensitivity of @xmath44 to line outages , therefore we call @xmath45 the real power performance parameter of the network upon cutting line @xmath7",
    ". the _ overload rate _ is then defined as : @xmath46    in figure [ 30s_tot ] , we have plotted the vulnerability @xmath47 ( eq .  ( [ vuln ] ) ) , the vulnerability @xmath48 ( eq .  ( [ wuln ] ) ) and the overload rate ( eq .  ( [ overload ] ) ) versus line removal for the ieee test cases with 30 and 57 nodes respectively .",
    "a few comments on the overload rate are appropriate .",
    "as we have shown , the overload rate is obtained by computing the power flow through each line of the network in the dc approximation . for a given network ,",
    "the value of the dc power flow through each line is a non linear function of power injections ( withdraws ) at the generators ( loads ) . on the other hand ,",
    "those values are not taken into account in the definitions of efficiency and net - ability .",
    "furthermore , in the ieee test cases several generators produce pure reactive power , namely they are assigned a real power output equal to zero .",
    "on one side this means that these are not treated as generators in a dc flow model ; on the other side these nodes are considered as generators both by the efficiency and net - ability algorithms . in order to overcome this limit ,",
    "we have chosen to assign arbitrary values of active power output to the generators which are purely reactive . in table",
    "[ conversion ] , we show explicitly these changes : in particular we keep the ieee numeration for the generators , @xmath49 indicates the ieee real power output , while @xmath50 indicates the real power output assigned here .",
    ".real power conversion for the ieee 30- and 57-nodes generators .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , a new network metric called _ net - ability _ is proposed , to evaluate the global performance of electric power grids .",
    "our aim was to estimate the impact of line outages on the network performance in order to identify the most critical lines . in this respect",
    "we have analyzed sample networks taken from the ieee database @xcite .",
    "for each system , three different methods to evaluate the impact of line outages have been used : 1- the method based on efficiency ; 2- the new method based on net - ability ; 3- the computation of line overloads by dc power flow .",
    "since the latter is the approach which takes into account the specific details of power grids , it can be considered as the reference method . from this point of view , the net - ability is capable of identifying some of the most critical lines .",
    "however , we stress how the line overloads depend non linearly upon the values of power injections / withdraws at the nodes . in real power networks",
    "such values are not constant , as the demand and production of electrical power vary considerably in time , for instance depending on the period of the year and the hours of the day . on the other hand , both the efficiency and the net - ability approach",
    "are based essentially on the topological features of the network and do not take into account the actual values of power injections and withdraws .    in order to check the validity of these topological approaches for real networks ,",
    "one should compare their results with those obtained from overload computation , after performing a sort of time integration of the latter . at present such kind of time",
    "integration looks difficult to be implemented in an algorithm .",
    "however , it is actually performed by direct observation by those companies which are in charge of the management and control of power grids in each country and therefore have monitored each country network for years . we have investigated the data of the italian power grid from terna - rete elettrica nazionale s.p.a .",
    "@xcite in terms of net - ability , in order to find the most critical lines in the network .",
    "although explicit results are confidential for obvious security reasons , we can say that a good match has been found between the results obtained by the net - ability algorithm and the experimental measurements collected by terna .",
    "this work was supported by the next generation infrastructures foundation .",
    "here we provide a brief review of the main issues and tools of power system analysis used in this work ; for a comprehensive treatment we refer to @xcite .",
    "a power transmission system can be schematically represented as a grid whose lines are electrical transmission lines , while nodes are the points where electrical power can be injected , withdrawn or redistributed .",
    "accordingly , in a power grid one can distinguish three types of nodes : generation nodes ( generators or power plants ) , load nodes ( consumers ) , transmission nodes .",
    "each line in a power network has its own maximum power flow capability , which is the maximum amount of power flow that the line can sustain .",
    "power transmission systems operate in a sinusoidal steady state . for a circuit made of @xmath51 buses operating in ac regime the nodal equations are written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 are complex quantities . in matrix notation eq .",
    "[ matrix ] writes @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the vector of current sources , @xmath56 is the line admittance matrix and @xmath57 is the vector of node voltages .",
    "node @xmath58 is selected as the reference node ( _ ground _ ) , and node voltages @xmath59 are defined with respect to node 0 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath56 are formed as follows :    * diagonal elements @xmath60 : sum of the admittances of the lines connected to node @xmath0 ; * off - diagonal elements @xmath61 : minus the sum of the admittances of the lines connecting nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the complex power @xmath62 flowing through a node @xmath0 is defined as the product of the voltage @xmath59 and the complex conjugate of the current @xmath63 : @xmath64 @xmath44 and @xmath65 are called _ real _ and _ reactive _ power respectively , see @xcite for throughout explanation .",
    "since the quantities involved in a ac system show a sinusoidal behaviour , solving a full ac power flow model means that one has to solve a system of non linear equations , which is widely known to be a formidable task . the most common method to reduce the power flow problem to a set of linear equations",
    "is called the _ dc power flow_.    the dc power flow approach is based on a number of approximations :    * reactive power balance equations are ignored ; * line losses are ignored , that is the resistance of each line is set to zero , so only the reactance ( imaginary part of the impedance ) is considered : @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the reactance of the line connecting @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; * all voltage magnitudes are identically set to one per unit , @xmath70 ; * all voltage angles are assumed to be small , @xmath71 .    under these approximations ,",
    "the power flow through line @xmath7 , connecting nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is given by @xmath72    in a general circuit made of @xmath5 nodes and @xmath73 lines , where @xmath74 is the vector of real power injections , @xmath75 the vector of phase angles and @xmath76 the vector of power flows we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the @xmath79 admittance matrix :",
    "@xmath80    in terms of the vector of power flows we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 transmission matrix : @xmath84    the admittance matrix @xmath78 is singular since the sum of the elements of each row is equal to zero : @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the total injection power is equal to zero : @xmath87 to avoid this redundancy a _ slack node _ , for instance node @xmath5 , is chosen and set @xmath88 .",
    "thus one can eliminate the corresponding terms in power vectors and matrices without losing information . in this spirit , @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "are sub - matrices , obtained respectively from @xmath78 and @xmath82 by deleting the row and column ( only the column in case of @xmath82 ) corresponding to the slack node @xmath5 , while @xmath91 and @xmath92 are respectively the vector of phase angles and vector of node power injections without the slack node @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix @xmath89 can be inverted and thus one can rewrite eqs .",

    "<S> power grids exhibit patterns of reaction to outages similar to complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> blackout sequences follow power laws , as complex systems operating near a critical point . here , the tolerance of electric power grids to both accidental and malicious outages is analyzed in the framework of complex network theory . in particular , the quantity known as _ efficiency _ is modified by introducing a new concept of _ distance _ between nodes . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , a new parameter called _ net - ability _ is proposed to evaluate the performance of power grids . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between _ efficiency _ and _ net - ability _ is provided by estimating the _ vulnerability _ of sample networks , in terms of both the metrics . </S>",

    "<S> wide growing interconnections , the security of networks such as world - wide - web , transport , power systems , is becoming a priority in the agenda of policy - makers , industrial and academic researchers . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> several blackouts occurring in usa and europe have drawn a lot of attention to security problems in electric power transmission systems . in these scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to go beyond the traditional deterministic _ bottom - up _ description in favor of a statistical _ top - down _ approach . </S>",
    "<S> also the specific area of power systems has attracted the physicists community interested in the applications of complex network theory . in this paper , we investigate the topological structure and resilience of power grids by adopting a complex network description . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the geodesic distance , used in complex network metrics , can be generalized to account for the flow capacity between nodes . based on this new concept of distance , a metric called _ net - ability _ </S>",
