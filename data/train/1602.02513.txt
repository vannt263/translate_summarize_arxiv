    "are the fundamental _ constants _ in nature really _ constant _ over the cosmological time scale ?",
    "this question has a long history in physics and cosmology , and has been discussed intensively in different contexts .",
    "one of the most famous examples includes the large number hypothesis by @xcite , who raises a possibility of the gravitational constant @xmath1 being proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a curious oscillatory trend in the values of @xmath1 measured over the last three decades , @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "more intriguingly , they claimed that the period and phase of the modulation are in agreement with the variation of the length of the day of the earth @xcite .",
    "the proposed modulation , however , is unlikely to reflect the real time variation of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of @xmath8 is shown to be inconsistent with the dynamics of the solar system @xcite .",
    "in addition , the subsequent studies have shown that the trend reported by @xcite is more likely to be an artifact .",
    "nevertheless , it is important and interesting to discuss and compare with other independent constraints on @xmath9 on such short time scales since most of the previous literature focused on @xmath9 averaged over the cosmological time scale .    for that purpose",
    ", we consider the orbital periods of transiting exoplanetary systems in the present paper . so far , more than 4000 candidate systems have been reported by the _ kepler _ mission @xcite , which have been monitored over several years , and approximately 1000 of them have been confirmed to host planets .",
    "the orbital period @xmath10 of such planets can be accurately determined by their central transit times .",
    "furthermore , a systematic search for any time variability of the period has been performed primarily in order to probe the gravitational interaction between multiple planets , which is referred to as transit timing variation ( ttv , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ttv analysis is conventionally used to determine the mass of planets without radial velocity follow - up observations and/or to infer the presence of undetected perturbers .",
    "instead , we attempt to put a constraint on the time variation of @xmath1 from the same analysis , but focusing on those systems that exhibit no clear ttv signature . in particular , _ hot jupiters _ , planets orbiting around host stars within a week or so , are particularly suited for constraining the variation of @xmath1 on time scales of months to years .",
    "as will be shown below , our sample yields the constraint @xmath4 _ if @xmath5 is constant _ , which is weaker by six orders of magnitude than those based on the pulsar timing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lunar ranging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that the conventional assumption of the constant @xmath11 is not general , but has been introduced just for simplicity .",
    "if @xmath1 would vary periodically as was claimed by @xcite , planetary systems with different orbital periods would be ideal to search for the possible resonant effect close to the variation period of days to years , and thus the resulting constraint on the amplitude of @xmath11 could be stronger depending on the expected period of the oscillation",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to know the current limit from the existing systems at this point in any case .",
    "the precise data of our solar system also put more stringent constraints on the variation of @xmath1 , but they are mostly sensitive to the variability on time scales of years , and the perturbative effect of eight planets and other bodies need to be carefully separated , as has been performed by @xcite for instance . on the contrary , the result from different transiting systems can be simply added for tighter constraints because the effect of @xmath9 should change the period of any system in a coherent fashion . for these reasons , ttvs of transiting planetary systems offer a complementary and straightforward method to explore the variation of @xmath1 on shorter time scales .",
    "in the two - body problem , motion of a planet around its host star is exactly periodic , and so are its transits .",
    "the transit times of a planet in a multiple planetary system , however , sometimes deviate from the exact periodicity due to the gravitational perturbation from other planets in the system .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the `` transit timing variation '' ( ttv , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has been successfully modeled in tens of multi - transiting planetary systems discovered by _",
    "kepler _ to determine the mass ratios of their member planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as to infer the existence of non - transiting planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : ttv ] displays an example of the ttv signals for the kepler-9 system , which is the first multiple planetary system detected through the transit method .",
    "it hosts two transiting planets , kepler-9b ( @xmath12 ) and kepler-9c ( @xmath13 ) with orbital periods of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the orbital periods of the two planets are not exactly constant because of the strong mutual gravitational interaction between the two in addition to the dominant gravity due to the host star ( 1.07@xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "this results in systematic deviations of the central transit times with respect to the mean period as exhibited in filled circles .",
    "such ttv signals have often been used to constrain the system parameters , in particular to estimate the mass of planets without radial velocity measurement . in the following ,",
    "however , we use the _ absence _ of the ttv signal to put an upper limit on the period variation @xmath17 , which translates into @xmath9 through kepler s third law : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the semi - major axis and @xmath20 is the total mass of the two - body system .    although equation ( [ eq : kepler-3rd ] ) is exactly correct only when @xmath1 is constant , we assume that it still holds when @xmath1 varies adiabatically , as we consider here",
    ". then it leads to @xmath21 note that the variation of @xmath1 , in principle , simultaneously induces non - vanishing @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus it may be more useful to rewrite equation ( [ eq : kepler-3rd ] ) in terms of the specific angular momentum @xmath24 and the eccentricity @xmath25 : @xmath26 then we have @xmath27 equation ( [ eq : dotp-2 ] ) simply reduces to @xmath28 if the orbit is circular and both the specific angular momentum and mass are conserved under the variation of @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the assumption of @xmath29 is perfectly justified for non - relativistic stars and planets considered here , it is not the case for compact objects including neutron stars .      among the confirmed transiting planets observed with _ kepler _ , we select kepler-1b ( or tres-2 ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 period , and kepler-2b ( or hat - p-7b ) with @xmath32 and @xmath33 period .",
    "the two planets have the highest transit signal - to - noise ratio , while exhibiting no identifiable feature of ttvs . in figure",
    "[ fig : individual ] , we show the fractional variations in the orbital periods of these planets against the observed date . for each planet",
    ", we follow the procedure of @xcite to determine the central times of individual transits @xmath34 , where @xmath35 stands for the number of transits counted from a fixed epoch . here",
    "we use only the data sampled at a short cadence ( one minute ) , which yield the transit times with higher precision than the long cadence data sampled at the @xmath36-minute interval .",
    "we compute the orbital period @xmath37 between @xmath34 and @xmath38 for each @xmath35 and plot @xmath39 against @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an average of all @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding root - mean - square @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 for kepler-1b and kepler-2b , respectively .",
    "these values translate into @xmath45 and @xmath46 over four years , which are smaller than the amplitude of the proposed variation of @xmath1 @xcite by an order of magnitude .",
    "the constraints from the above two systems almost reach the limit of the _ kepler _ photometry for the existing systems .",
    "however , the further improvement can be achieved by combining many systems in a statistical fashion .",
    "we select 10 confirmed transiting planetary systems with the highest transit signal - to - noise ratios : kepler-1 , kepler-2 , kepler-13 , kepler-12 , kepler-6 , kepler-7 , kepler-423 , kepler-17 , kepler-5 , and kepler-3 .",
    "none of these systems exhibit any clear ttvs .",
    "although the transit times in some of these systems ( e.g. , kepler-3 or alias hat - p-11 ) are affected by the strong star - spot activities that deform the transit signals , we do not exclude them because our purpose here is simply to illustrate the advantage of combining the constraints from many independent systems .",
    "we apply the same analysis as in the previous subsection to the above 10 systems .",
    "we plot the resulting @xmath42 as the gray dots in figure [ fig : statistical ] , and their averages in @xmath2-day bins as the black circles with error bars . now",
    "the standard deviation of the binned @xmath42 is @xmath47 , which is a few times smaller than the constraints from the individual systems .",
    "note that the choice of the smoothing bin size is completely arbitrary at this point .",
    "the binning would smooth out a possible variation of @xmath1 less than the bin size and the resulting @xmath42 would depend on the bin size . here",
    "we choose the 10-day bin just for definiteness , and could use a different value if a specific model of the variation of @xmath1 is given .",
    "the periodogram of the binned @xmath42 in figure [ fig : periodogram ] delivers a rough idea of the expected constraints for the different choice of the smoothing bin size .",
    "all of the peaks in the periodogram have the amplitudes less than the significance level of @xmath48 ( horizontal dashed line ) and are consistent with the gaussian noise , i.e. , the data exhibit no significant modulation over the period range down to @xmath49 .",
    "a larger bin size therefore should put a somewhat stronger constraint on @xmath42 , and hence on @xmath50 .",
    "the proper interpretation of the constraint , however , depends on the model of @xmath51 .",
    "we have shown that the methodology of using exoplanets as a precision clock provides reaonably interesting limits on the time variation of @xmath1 .",
    "our current analysis finds @xmath52 for 20092013 , which corresponds to @xmath53 if @xmath5 is constant .",
    "in contrast , constraints from lunar laser ranging experiments and the binary pulsar system psr b1913 + 16 correspond to @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 @xcite , respectively .    although our current constraint is significantly less stringent than the binary pulsar timing result that is based on the similar principle , it is complementary in many aspects .",
    "first , we can safely neglect @xmath23 for exoplanetary systems unlike binary pulsar systems where the self - gravitational energy significantly contributes to the total mass .",
    "second , we may constrain the @xmath22-term independently of @xmath56 by combining the precise measurement of the radial velocity ( proportional to @xmath57 ) with the photometric transit timing data .",
    "third , the timing analysis of the secondary eclipse ( opposite phase of the planetary transit in front of the host star , i.e. , the occultation of the planet by the stellar disk ) of transiting planets may also constrain the @xmath22-term through the variation of the expected arrival time difference @xmath58 from the photometric data alone .",
    "fourth , the growing number of continuously monitored transiting planets promises to statistically improve the constraint beyond the value that we discussed in this paper .",
    "incidentally , if @xmath1 varies periodically with an oscillation period of days to years , the dynamics of the planetary system with the similar orbital period would be perturbed in a resonant fashion .",
    "while we have not studied such a possible resonant effect in this paper , constraints from systems with different periods are important once the simple assumption of constant @xmath11 is abandoned .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the current data for numerous exoplanetary systems are already precise enough to put complementary and meaningful constraints on the variation of the fundamental constants , as has been feasible only through the solar system data and/or a few binary pulsars .",
    "thus future data of the exoplanetary systems should definitely improve the situation and might even bring an unexpected surprise .",
