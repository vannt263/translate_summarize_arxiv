    "the field of computational astrophysics is entering an exciting and challenging era .",
    "the large amount of observational data involving general relativistic phenomena requires the integration of numerical relativity with the traditional tools of astrophysics , such as hydrodynamics , magneto - hydrodynamics , nuclear astrophysics , and radiation transport .",
    "general relativistic astrophysics  astrophysics involving gravitational fields so strong and dynamical that the full einstein field equations are required for its accurate description , is quickly becoming a promising area of research .    ",
    "@xmath0 correspondence should be addressed to mark miller .    as a first step in our study of `` computational general relativistic astrophysics '' , our collaboration ( the ncsa / potsdam / wash u numerical relativity collaboration ) is building a code called `` cactus '' for solving the full set of einstein field equations coupled to a perfect fluid source .",
    "such a code will have many applications for astrophysical processes involving neutron stars and black holes . in this paper",
    "we present the formulation and methods of the 3d general relativistic hydrodynamic part of the code , and its coupling to the spacetime part of the code . we also present various tests for the validation of the code .",
    "the complimentary presentation on the ( vacuum ) spacetime evolution part of the code has been given in  @xcite . in the following we begin by discussing the background of our code development effort .",
    "two of the major directions of astronomy in the next century are high energy astrophysics ( @xmath1-ray and @xmath2-ray astronomy ) and gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the former is driven by advanced x - ray and @xmath2-ray satellite observations , e.g. , cgro , axaf , glast  @xcite , xmm , integral , that are either current or planned in the next few years .",
    "high energy radiation is often emitted by highly relativistic events in regions of strong gravitational fields , e.g. , near black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss )",
    ". one of the biggest mysteries of modern astronomy , @xmath2-ray bursts , is likely related to processes involving interactions of compact binaries ( bh / ns or ns / ns ) or highly explosive collapse to a black hole ( `` hypernova '' ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . such high energy astrophysical events often involve highly dynamical gravitational fields , strong gravitational wave emissions , and ejecta moving at ultrarelativistic speeds with relativistic lorentz factors up to @xmath3 .",
    "the modeling of such events can only be achieved by means of hydrodynamical simulations in the full theory of general relativity .    the second major direction , gravitational wave astronomy , involves the dynamical nature of spacetime in einstein s theory of gravity .",
    "the tremendous recent interest in this frontier is driven by the gravitational wave observatories presently being built or planned in the us , europe , and outer space , e.g. , ligo , virgo , geo600 , lisa , lagos  @xcite , and the lunar outpost astrophysics program  @xcite .",
    "the american ligo and its european counterparts virgo and geo600 are scheduled to be on line in a few years  @xcite , making gravitational wave astronomy a reality .",
    "the space detector lisa has been selected as one of the three `` cornerstone missions '' of the european space agency  @xcite .",
    "these observatories provide a completely new window on the universe : existing observations are mainly provided by the electromagnetic spectrum , emitted by individual electrons , atoms , or molecules , and are easily absorbed , scattered , and dispersed .",
    "gravitational waves are produced by the coherent bulk motion of matter and travel nearly unscathed through space , coming to us carrying the information of the strong field regions where they were originally generated  @xcite .",
    "this new window will provide very different information about our universe that is either difficult or impossible to obtain by traditional means .",
    "the numerical ( theoretical ) determination of gravitational waveforms is crucial for gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "physical information in the data is to be extracted through template matching techniques  @xcite , which _ presupposes _ that reliable waveforms are known .",
    "accurate waveform detections are important both as probes of the fundamental nature of gravity and for the unique physical and astronomical information they carry , ranging from nuclear physics ( the equation of state of nss  @xcite ) to cosmology ( direct determination of the hubble constant without going through the `` cosmic distance ladder ''  @xcite ) . in most situations ,",
    "the waveform can not be calculated without a numerical simulation based on the full theory of general relativity .",
    "this need for waveform templates is an important motivation of our effort .    in short , both of these frontiers of astronomy call for computational general relativistic astrophysics , i.e.",
    ", the integration of numerical relativity with traditional tools of computational astrophysics , e.g. , computational hydrodynamics , radiation transport , nuclear astrophysics , and magneto - hydrodynamics . if we are to fully understand the observational data generated by the non - linear and dynamical gravitational fields , detailed modeling taking dynamic general relativity into full account must be carried out .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing some of the significant existing investigations in the field of numerical general relativistic hydrodynamics ( gr - hydro in the following ) to set the stage for the description of our own work .",
    "while there has been much effort in the study of relativistic hydrodynamics in _ pre - determined _ ( fixed , or with its time evolution specified ) background spacetimes , we focus on studies that are most relevant to _ dynamical _ spacetimes with the matter flows acting as sources to the einstein equations .    the pioneering work dates back to the one - dimensional supernova core - collapse code by may and white  @xcite .",
    "it was based on a lagrangian ( i.e. , coordinates co - moving with the fluid ) finite difference scheme with artificial viscosity terms included in the equations to damp the spurious numerical oscillations caused by the presence of shock waves in the flow solution .",
    "numerous astrophysical simulations were based on this approach .",
    "one drawback is that the lagrangian character of the code makes it difficult to be extended to the multidimensional case .",
    "the pioneering eulerian ( i.e. , coordinates not co - moving with the fluid ) finite difference gr - hydro code was developed by wilson  @xcite in the early 70 s .",
    "it used a combination of artificial viscosity ( av ) and upwind techniques .",
    "it became the kernel of a large number of codes developed in the 80 s .",
    "many different astrophysical scenarios were investigated with these codes , ranging from axisymmetric stellar core - collapse  @xcite , to accretion onto compact objects  @xcite , and to numerical cosmology  @xcite . in the following , we give a short overview of this large body of work , paying more attention to the numerical methods used than to the physical results obtained .    while there are a large number of numerical investigations in pre - determined background spacetimes based on the av approach ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , we focus on those using a fully self - consistent treatment evolving the spacetime dynamically with the einstein equations coupled to a hydrodynamic source .",
    "although there is much recent interest in this direction , only the spherically symmetric case ( 1d ) can be considered essentially solved  @xcite . in axisymmetry ,",
    "i.e. 2d , only a few attempts have been made , with most of them devoted to the study of the gravitational collapse and bounce of rotating stellar cores and the subsequent emission of gravitational radiation  @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to calculate a general relativistic stellar core collapse .",
    "the computation succeeded in tracking the evolution of matter and the formation of a black hole but the numerical scheme was not accurate enough to compute the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "the code in  @xcite used a radial gauge and a mixture of polar and maximal slicing .",
    "the gr - hydro equations were solved with standard finite difference methods with av terms . in  @xcite",
    "the numerical scheme for the matter fields was more sophisticated , using monotonic upwind reconstruction procedures and flux limiters , with discontinuous solutions handled by adding av terms in the equations . in  @xcite",
    ", a numerical study of the stability of star clusters in axisymmetry was performed . in this investigation ,",
    "the source of the gravitational field was assumed to be a configuration of collisionless ( dust ) particles , which reduces the hydrodynamic computation to a straightforward integration of the geodesic equations .",
    "three - dimensional extensions of these av based gr - hydro treatments have been attempted over the last few years .",
    "wilson s original scheme has been applied to the study of ns binary coalescence in  @xcite under the assumption of a conformally flat spacetime , which leads to a considerable simplification of the gravitational field equations .",
    "a code employing the _ full _ set of einstein equations and self - gravitating matter fields is currently being developed  @xcite . in this work",
    "the complete set of the equations , spacetime and hydrodynamics , are finite differenced in a uniform cartesian grid using van leer s scheme  @xcite with total variation diminishing ( tvd ) flux limiters ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "shock waves are spread out using a tensor av algorithm . with this code",
    "they have studied the gravitational collapse of a rotating polytrope to a black hole ( comparing to the original axisymmetric computation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the coalescence of a binary ns system .",
    "further work to achieve longer term stability is under way  @xcite .",
    "the success of the artificial viscosity approach is well - known .",
    "however , it has inherent difficulties in handling the ultrarelativistic regime  @xcite . in wilson s formulation of the gr - hydro equations ,",
    "there are explicit spacetime derivatives of the pressure in the source terms .",
    "this breaks the conservative character of the system and introduces complications into the numerical treatment .",
    "this motivated , in recent years , the effort of extending to relativistic hydrodynamics high - resolution shock - capturing schemes ( hrsc ) originally developed in classical ( newtonian ) computational fluid dynamics .",
    "such schemes are based on the solution of local riemann problems , exploiting the hyperbolicity of the hydrodynamic equations . to use such numerical treatments ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are first cast into a first order ( hyperbolic ) system of conservation ( or balance ) laws .",
    "the characteristic fields of the system are then determined which allows the construction of numerical schemes which propagate the information along the fluid characteristics .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a review of these methods for general hyperbolic systems of conservation laws .",
    "hrsc schemes were first introduced into gr - hydro in  @xcite , and applied in ( spherical ) dynamical spacetimes in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the latter investigation focussed on , among other problems , the study of supernova core collapse ( including the infall epoch , bounce , and shock propagation ) .",
    "the numerical code was based on the radial - gauge and polar - slicing coordinate conditions  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the gr - hydro equations were analyzed in the `` 3 + 1 '' formalism and the theoretical building blocks to construct a hrsc scheme in multidimensions were presented .",
    "axisymmetric studies using hrsc schemes are currently being carried out in  @xcite .",
    "this investigation focussed on the study of accretion phenomena onto ( dynamic ) rotating black holes and the associated emission of gravitational radiation induced by the presence of the matter fields .",
    "axisymmetric studies will also provide useful  test beds \" in forthcoming investigations with the present 3d code discussed in this paper . as will be discussed in later sections of this paper , our present code",
    "is based on the same hrsc algorithmic machinery as in the aforementioned works .",
    "we extend the treatment to 3d , and develop a code that makes no assumptions on the nature of the spacetime , the form of the metric , or the slicing and spatial coordinates .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the above references for a first understanding of the numerical schemes used in our work .",
    "we also want to mention a completely different approach for gr - hydro based on pseudospectral methods  @xcite .",
    "these methods are well known for having extraordinary accuracy in smooth regions of the solution .",
    "the numerical error is evanescent , i.e. , it decreases as @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the number of coefficients in the spectral expansion .",
    "the main drawback of pseudospectral methods has been , traditionally , the inaccurate modeling of discontinuous solutions due to the appearance of the so - called gibbs phenomenon . in the presence of discontinuities , the numerical approximation of the solution does not converge at the discontinuity and spurious oscillations appear . recently , however , an innovative pseudospectral method based on a multidomain decomposition has been developed  @xcite which circumvents the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "this new approach has already been shown to work remarkably well in the 3d numerical construction of mclaurin and roche equilibrium models .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the main issues we considered in choosing our approach , building on the existing work discussed above .",
    "the main aim of our program is to study violent and highly - energetic astrophysical processes like ns / ns coalescence within the framework of general relativity .",
    "these scenarios involve strong gravitational fields , matter motion with ( ultra ) relativistic speeds and/or strong shock waves .",
    "these features make the numerical integration of the hydrodynamic equations a very demanding task .",
    "the difficulty is exacerbated by the intrinsic multidimensional character of these astrophysical systems , and by the inherent complexities in einstein theory of gravity , e.g. , coordinate degrees of freedom and the possible formation of curvature singularities ( e.g. , collapse of matter configurations to black holes ) .",
    "these complications call for the use of advanced numerical methodology , a flexible code construction which allows for the use of different treatments , and a large amount of careful testbed studies . in the following we discuss these issues in more detail .",
    "two major issues in gr - hydro which are purely hydrodynamical in origin are the numerical modeling of flows with large lorentz factors and strong shock waves . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the av based schemes have difficulties in handling ultrarelativistic velocity flows with lorentz factors @xmath6 . as a result ,  @xcite proposed using implicit finite difference schemes to handle the gr - hydro equations in the ultrarelativistic regime .",
    "however , investigations during the last decade have provided increasing evidence that the most appropriate schemes to deal with ultra - relativistic flow with strong shocks are those based on ( approximate or exact ) riemann solvers , i.e. , hrsc schemes .",
    "these methods have high accuracy ( second order or more ) in regions where the flow solution is smooth , and at the same time are able to resolve discontinuities in the solution ( e.g. , shock waves ) with little smearing .",
    "they have been extensively tested and found to be applicable in the ultra - relativistic regime ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review ) .    while we believe hrsc schemes may be capable of providing the technology for treating the hydrodynamic part of the evolution ,",
    "the field of computational gr - hydro still contains many issues that are as yet unexplored , especially for cases where the relativistic fluid is coupled to a dynamical spacetime . for a fully dynamical spacetime ,",
    "one major issue is the handling of the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this problem is exacerbated in 3d simulations without symmetry assumptions . in a general 3d problem , there is no preferred choice of gauge to restrict the metric functions as in lower dimension simulations ( e.g. , radial gauge and polar slicing in spherically symmetric simulations ) .",
    "lagrangian coordinate systems are inappropriate for complicated 3d flows .",
    "the inevitable lower resolution in 3d simulations also makes the problem more acute . even in vacuum spacetime studies ,",
    "the choice and implementation of appropriate gauge conditions for a general dynamical evolution is a largely unexplored territory  @xcite .",
    "how will the gauge choices be affected by the presence of relativistic fluid flows or by the existence of strong shocks which create sharp features in the sources of the metric evolution ?",
    "for example , what will be a useful gauge condition for a process like the inspiral of a ns / ns binary ? these are completely open issues . in order to provide the capability to investigate these problems ,",
    "the code we construct here is designed to allow arbitrary gauge conditions , making no assumptions on the lapse function or the shift vector .",
    "another class of problems involves the connection of the numerical integration of the hydrodynamic equations to that of the spacetime equations .",
    "what is the best set of variables to use , locally measured quantities , coordinate variables , densitized quantities or some combination ? with the spacetime metric an evolved variable ,",
    "there are many choices .",
    "what is the best way to connect the hydrodynamics and the spacetime finite differencing steps to achieve not only a second order accurate scheme in both space and time , but also in a way that is suitable for long term evolutions ?",
    "even in newtonian strong field evolutions , coupling the hydrodynamic integration to the gravitational potential calculation in different ways can yield different long term behavior  @xcite . as a consequence of the different character of the equations governing the geometry of the spacetime and the evolution of the matter fields , the numerical methods to handle them are drastically different .",
    "what are the effects of combining different methods , and is there a best combination for a particular class of problems ?",
    "with the recent development of hyperbolic formulations in gr , an interesting possibility would be to consider all of the dynamical variables , both spacetime and matter fields , to be members of one master state vector .",
    "the entire system of equations could then be written as a single ( vector ) conservation ( or balance ) equation .",
    "one could then apply the same hrsc schemes to the entire system .",
    "what advantages would this bring ?",
    "these are some of the issues that we have in mind in choosing our approach in developing the code as will be discussed next .",
    "our overall goal is to develop an efficient , flexible , computational tool for general relativistic astrophysics . specifically for this paper ,",
    "the aims are : ( 1 ) to establish the formulation , including the spectral decomposition of the gr - hydro equations , on which our code is based , ( 2 ) to validate the numerical code we constructed for solving the gr - hydro equations , and ( 3 ) to compare the different numerical schemes we used .",
    "the set of differential equations we are attempting to solve consists of very complicated , coupled partial differential equations involving thousands of terms .",
    "considering the complexity and generality of the code , along with the fact that the solution space of the differential equations is largely unexplored , it is essential that any physical result produced by a 3d gr - hydro code be preceded by a series of tests such as the ones we report here , in order to insure the fidelity of the discretization to the original differential equations .",
    "in fact , we consider the tests presented here to be a minimal set : _ any _ 3d gr - hydro code should be able to reproduce these results .",
    "further tests , especially those related to the long term stability of the code and detailed comparisons of 3d and 1d results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    in exploring the very complex system of the gr - hydro equations ,",
    "it is also essential to have the capability to compare results based on different mathematical formulations and different numerical schemes .",
    "our code is currently set up to allow two different formulations of the einstein equations : the standard arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation  @xcite and the bona - mass ( bm ) hyperbolic formulation  @xcite ( other hyperbolic formulations will be included and reported later ) .",
    "the code allows for two different choices for finite differencing the adm equations : a standard leapfrog scheme and an iterative crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "the bm equations are finite differenced using a strang split to separate the source and flux updates .",
    "the latter are performed using a maccormack method . as for the numerical treatment of the hydrodynamic equations , the code has the capability of using three different hrsc schemes : the first one is the flux split method , mainly chosen for its simplicity .",
    "the second is roe s method  @xcite ( note that contrary to  @xcite , we do not use roe s averaging but instead employ arithmetic averaging ( see section  [ sec : discrete ] below for details ) ) .",
    "the third scheme we use is the recently developed marquina s method  @xcite .",
    "all three schemes are coupled to the spacetime evolution solver in a way which is second order accurate in both space and time .    in this code",
    "we also allow for arbitrary spacetime coordinate conditions .",
    "as mentioned previously , this enables the investigation of gauge choices in gr - hydro and allows the use of different coordinate systems for different astrophysical simulations .",
    "this capability is built into our development , and we have carried out tests with non - trivial lapses and shifts in this paper . however , more investigation is needed in this direction .      as the aim of our program is to study",
    "_ realistic _",
    "astrophysical systems , which often require full 3d simulations and involve many different time and length scales , it is important that the computer code we develop be capable of carrying out large scale simulations .",
    "this requires the use of massively parallel supercomputers .",
    "the `` cactus '' code was built with this in mind .",
    "here we give a brief overview of the computational infrastructure of the code and its performance . for a more extensive review ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the cactus code achieves parallelism through the mpi message passing interface @xcite .",
    "this allows high performance portable parallelism using a distributed memory model .",
    "all major high performance parallel architectures , including the sgi origin 2000 , cray t3e , hp / convex exemplar , and ibm sp-2 support this programming model .",
    "the mpi layer of cactus also allows computing on clusters of networked workstations and pc s .",
    "parallelism in cactus is based on a generic domain decomposition , distributing uniform grid functions across multiple processors and providing ghost - zone based communications for a variety of stencil widths and grid staggerings .",
    "the code can also compile without mpi , allowing the same source code to be run on a single processor workstation and on massively parallel supercomputers .",
    "the platforms currently supported and tested include : the sgi origin 2000 ( up to 256 nodes ) , the cray t3e ( up to 1024 nodes ) , sgi o2 clusters , nt clusters , dec alphas , and sgi workstations .",
    "we have recently benchmarked a version of the code ( the `` gr3d '' version , constructed for the nasa neutron star grand challenge project , see http://wugrav.wustl.edu/relativ/nsgc.html ) on a 1024 node t3e-1200 , achieving over 140 gflop / sec and a scaling efficiency of over 95% ( for details of the benchmark , see http://wugrav.wustl.edu/codes/gr3d/ ) . besides the floating point and scaling efficiency",
    ", it is also noteworthy that a relatively large grid size ( 644 x 644 x 1284 grid points for 32 bit accuracy , and 500 x 500 x 996 grid points for 64 bit accuracy ) were used for the benchmarked run on the t3e-1200 .",
    "this is made possible by the efficient memory usage of the code . with the full set of the einstein equations coupled to the relativistic hydrodynamics equations ,",
    "a large number of 3d arrays are required to evolve the system . in order to have reasonable resolutions for realistic simulations ,",
    "it is essential that the code make efficient use of available memory .",
    "it is also essential that the code be highly optimized in order for these large simulations to be carried out in a reasonable time .    during the code development , special attention",
    "was also given to software engineering problems , such as collaborative code development , maintenance , and management .",
    "the code was developed to be shared by the entire community for the investigation of general relativistic astrophysics .",
    "to minimize barriers associated with collaborative development , the code was constructed to have : 1 . a modular code structure that allows new code modules to easily plug in as `` thorns '' to the core part of the code ( the `` flesh '' ) .",
    "the `` flesh '' contains the parallel domain decomposition software , i / o , and various utilities .",
    "2 . a consistency test suite library to make sure that new thorns will not conflict with other parts of the code .",
    "3 . various code development tools , such as : documentation , elliptic solvers , and visualization tools , which provide a complete environment for code development , and testing . for detailed discussions of these and other features of collaborative infrastructure of the code ,",
    "see @xcite    these computational features of the code significantly enhance our effort in constructing a multi - purpose code for general relativistic astrophysics .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the formulation of the differential equations are given in section  [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "a spectral decomposition of the gr - hydro equations suitable for a general non - diagonal spatial metric is presented .",
    "the details of the discretization of the equations and of the coupling of the spacetime and hydrodynamics are given in section  [ sec : discrete ] .",
    "shock tube tests are performed in section  [ sec : shocktube ] for shocks along the coordinate axes and along the diagonal .",
    "these test the hydrodynamic part of the code , with the background geometry held flat .",
    "we then go on to test the coupling of the hydrodynamics to curved and dynamical spacetimes .",
    "section  [ sec : frw ] is on tests using friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies with dust .",
    "section  [ sec : tov ] contains tests using static spherical star solutions with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "we present a practical procedure which gives stable evolution of the surface region of the star .",
    "section  [ sec : boost ] contains tests using the spherical star solutions described in section  [ sec : tov ] but now relativistically boosted along the diagonal @xmath7 .",
    "this is a strong test of the fully coupled spacetime and hydrodynamics system , with all possible terms in the equations activated and with a non - trivial lapse and shift .",
    "finally , section viii contains a brief summary .",
    "all tests presented in sections  [ sec : frw]-[sec : boost ] contain convergence studies performed in the following way : errors are obtained by subtracting the exact solution at a specific time from the computed solution for a number of dynamical variables .",
    "these errors are produced at three different resolutions , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . to demonstrate they have the correct convergence properties for a second order accurate discretization we check that each error function decreases by a factor of four for each factor of two increase in resolution .",
    "this is demonstrated by plotting the various error functions along 1-d lines .",
    "these convergence tests are an essential part in validating the code .",
    "in this subsection we present the hydrodynamic equations for a general curved spacetime in a form suitable for advanced numerical treatment .",
    "the equations for the evolution of the spacetime , including the hydrodynamic source , will be presented in a later subsection .    the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations , written in the standard covariant form , consist of the local conservation laws of the stress - energy , @xmath11 , and the matter current density , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the rest mass density and @xmath17 the 4-velocity of the fluid .",
    "@xmath18 stands for the covariant derivative with respect to the 4-metric of the underlying spacetime . throughout this paper",
    "we are using , unless otherwise stated , natural units ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "greek ( latin ) indices run from 0 to 3 ( 1 to 3 ) . in what follows",
    "we will neglect viscous effects , assuming the stress - energy tensor to be that of a perfect fluid @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fluid pressure and @xmath22 is the 4-metric describing the spacetime .",
    "in addition , the relativistic specific enthalpy , @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rest frame specific internal energy density of the fluid .",
    "the equations written in this covariant form are _ not _ suitable for the use of advanced numerical schemes . in order to carry out numerical hydrodynamic evolutions , and in particular to take advantage of the benefits of hrsc methods ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations after the 3 + 1 split must be written as a hyperbolic system of first order flux conservative equations .",
    "we introduce coordinates @xmath26 and write eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stressenergycons ] ) and ( [ eq : masscons ] ) in terms of coordinate derivatives .",
    "we project eq.([eq : stressenergycons ] ) and eq.([eq : masscons ] ) onto the basis @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being a timelike vector normal to a given hypersurface .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields the set of equations in the desired form @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a partial derivative with respect to time and @xmath31 indicates a partial derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate @xmath32 .",
    "the evolved state vector @xmath33 is given , in terms of the primitive variables @xmath34 , as @xmath35 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } \\sqrt{\\gamma } w \\rho \\\\ \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\rho h w^2 v_j \\\\ \\sqrt{\\gamma } ( \\rho h w^2 - p - w \\rho ) \\\\ \\end{array }    \\right ] , \\label{eq : evolvedvar}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the determinant of the 3-metric @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the fluid 3-velocity , and @xmath38 is the lorentz factor , @xmath39 . notice that the spatial components of the 4-velocity @xmath40 are related to the 3-velocity by the following formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the lapse function and the shift vector of the spacetime . also notice that we are using a slightly different set of variables as those used in  @xcite .",

    "those are used throughout , e.g. , in the computation of the characteristic fields ( see below ) . these variables can not be obtained from the evolved ones in a closed functional form . instead , they must be recovered through some appropriate root - finding procedure ( an example of this can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the use of hrsc schemes , as will be presented in detail in the next section , depends crucially on the knowledge of the spectral decomposition of the jacobian matrix of the system @xmath54 the characteristic speeds ( eigenvalues ) and fields ( eigenvectors ) are the key ingredients of any hrsc scheme .",
    "the spectral decomposition of the jacobian matrices of the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations with general equation of state was first reported in  @xcite ( for polytropic eos see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have found that the eigenvectors reported in  @xcite are correct only in the case of a diagonal spatial metric . in this section",
    "we display the full spectral decomposition valid for a generic spatial metric .",
    "we focus on the @xmath55-direction , hence presenting the spectral decomposition of @xmath56 , as the other two directions can be found by simple permutation of indices .",
