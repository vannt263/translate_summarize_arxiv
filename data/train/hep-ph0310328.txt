    "when starting in 1984 with discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite and with a revival of dirac s hamiltonian front form dynamics @xcite , all challenges of a gauge field hamiltonian theory were essentially open questions , particularly the non perturbative bound state problem , the many - body aspects , regularization , renormalization , confinement , chirality , vacuum structure and condensates , just to name a few .",
    "the step from the gauge field qcd lagrangian down to a non relativistic schrdinger equation was completely mysterious .",
    "now we know better @xcite .",
    "we have understood , for example , that the chiral phase transition , in which the quarks are supposed to get their mass , is not the major challenge .",
    "the challenge is to understand what happens _",
    "after _ the phase transition , at zero temperature .",
    "the challenge is to understand the spectrum of physical hadrons and to get the corresponding eigenfunctions , the light cone wave functions .",
    "the light - cone wave functions @xmath1 for a hadron with mass @xmath2 encode all possible quark and gluon momentum , helicity and flavor correlations and , in principle , are obtained by diagonalizing the qcd light - cone hamiltonian @xmath3 , @xmath4 , in a complete basis of fock states with increasing complexity .",
    "for example , the positive pion has the fock expansion : @xmath5 representing the expansion of the exact qcd eigenstate at scale @xmath6 in terms of non - interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "the particles in a fock state have longitudinal light - cone momentum fractions @xmath7 and relative transverse momenta @xmath8 .",
    "the form of @xmath9 is invariant under longitudinal and transverse boosts ; i.e. , the light - cone wave functions expressed in the relative coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent of the total momentum ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) of the hadron . the first term in the expansion is referred to as the valence fock state , as it relates to the hadronic description in the constituent quark model .",
    "the higher terms are related to the sea components of the hadronic structure .",
    "it has been shown that the rest of the light - cone wave function is determined once the valence fock state is known @xcite , with explicit expressions given in @xcite .",
    "the key issue is to overcome the problem of any gauge theory , that the unregulated theory exposes logarithmic singularities .",
    "the problem of regularization and renormalization has been solved in the perturbative context of scattering theory , but not in the non perturbative context of a hamiltonian .",
    "it is addressed to in the first two sections and applied in the remainder of this paper .",
    "canonical field theory with the conventional qcd lagrangian allows to derive the components of the total canonical four - momentum @xmath14 .",
    "its front form version @xcite rests on two assumptions , the light cone gauge @xmath15 @xcite and the suppression of all zero modes @xcite .",
    "the front form vacuum is then trivial .",
    "i find it helpful to discuss the problem in terms of dlcq @xcite . in the back of my mind",
    "i visualize an explicit finite dimensional matrix representation of the light - cone hamiltonian as it occurs for finite harmonic resolution .",
    "such one is schematically displayed in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "all of its matrix elements are finite for any finite @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the problem arises for ever increasing harmonic resolution , on the way to the continuum limit : the numerical eigenvalues are numerically unstable and diverge logarithmically @xcite , contrary to the calculations in 1 + 1 dimension @xcite .",
    "one must regulate the theory .    as usual , regularization is not unique , and can be done in many ways .",
    "but not all regularization techniques of the past are applicable in an hamiltonian approach .",
    "dimensional regularization , for example , is not applicable in a matrix approach which is stuck with the precisely 3 + 1 dimensions of the physical world .",
    "perturbative regularization @xcite is not applicable in the non - perturbative context .",
    "the fock space regularization of lepage and brodsky @xcite , see also @xcite has blocked renormalization for many years .",
    "it was impossible to find suitable counter terms . in recent work",
    ", the invariant mass squared regularization has been abandoned in favor of pauli - villars regularization @xcite .",
    "but thus far it is unclear how the approach @xcite is applicable to the spectra of physical mesons . after applauding the light - cone approach @xcite , wilson and collaborators @xcite",
    "have attempted to base their considerations almost entirely on a renormalization group analysis , but no concrete technology has emerged thus far .    in recent years",
    "i have favored an other regularization , which allows for renormalization and which is technically sufficiently simple to be carried out explicitly .",
    "all divergences can be traced back to dirac s relativistic vertex interaction @xmath18 , in which some particle ` 1 ' is scattered into two particles ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' with their respective four - momenta @xmath19 and helicities @xmath20 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : reg ] .",
    "the matrix element for bremsstrahlung , for example , is proportional to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , see table  9 in @xcite , when the quark maintains its helicity while irradiating a gluon with four - momentum @xmath23 .",
    "singularities arise typically when squares of such matrix elements are integrated over all @xmath24 as in the integrations of perturbation theory .",
    "the singularities are avoided _ a priori _ by _ vertex regularization _ , by multiplying each ( typically off - diagonal ) matrix element with a regulating _ form factor _",
    "@xmath25 : @xmath26 it took several years to realize that it is the feynman four - momentum transfer across a vertex , @xmath27 , which governs any effective interaction .",
    "the minimal requirement for such a form factor is @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the job would be done by a step function , @xmath30 .",
    "the limit @xmath31 suppresses the interaction all together , the limit @xmath32 restores the interaction and its problems .",
    "any finite value of @xmath33 restricts @xmath34 to be finite and eliminates the singularities .",
    "but the sharp cut - off generates problems in an other corner of the theory and @xmath35 must be an analytic function of @xmath36 , as to be seen below .    _",
    "vertex regularization _ takes thus care of the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the ( light - cone ) infrared singularities are taken care of as usual by a kinematical gluon mass .",
    "the non perturbative renormalization of the hamiltonian was stuck for many years by the fact that the coupling constant @xmath37 and the regulator function @xmath35 multiply each other in eq.([eq:2 ] ) .",
    "it was always clear that one may add _ non local counter terms _",
    "@xcite , but is was not clear how they could be constructed .",
    "progress has come from recent work on a particular model @xcite , which did allow to formulate a paradigmatic example in modern renormalization theory .",
    "here is the general but abstract procedure .",
    "suppose to have solved @xmath3 for a fixed value of the 7 ` bare ' parameters in the lagrangian , for the coupling constant @xmath38 and the 6 flavor quark masses @xmath39 , and for a fixed value of exterior cut - off scale @xmath40 .",
    "suppose further that these 7 + 1 parameters are chosen such , that the calculated @xmath41 agree with the corresponding experimental values .",
    "next , suppose to change the cut - off by a small amount @xmath42 .",
    "every calculated eigenvalue will then change by @xmath43 .",
    "renormalization theory is then the attempt to reformulate the hamiltonian , such , that all changes @xmath43 vanish identically .",
    "the fundamental renormalization group equation is therefore _ for all eigenstates _ @xmath44 : @xmath45 equivalently one requires that _ the hamiltonian is stationary _ , @xmath46 , with respect to small @xmath47 .",
    "hence forward reference to the renormalization point ( @xmath48 ) will be suppressed .",
    "the hamiltonian can be made stationary by making @xmath37 and the @xmath49 functions of @xmath6 , by introducing _",
    "physical _ coupling constants and masses , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , which themselves are functions of the bare @xmath37 and @xmath49 , and which are functionals of the regulator @xmath52 .",
    "the variation of @xmath53 reads then @xmath54 , with the familiar variational derivatives .",
    "however , since @xmath50 and @xmath51 are themselves functionals of @xmath55 , this reduces to @xmath56 .",
    "the fundamental equation of renormalization theory ( [ eq:4 ] ) is then replaced by @xmath57 it can be solved by counter term technology , as follows .",
    "a counter term is added to the hamiltonian , whose interaction has exactly the same structure except that the regulator @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath58 .",
    "this defines @xmath59 subject to the constraint that the counter term vanishes at the renormalization point , @xmath60 .",
    "the fundamental equation ( [ eq:6a ] ) defines then a differential equation @xmath61 , which , in its integral form , includes the initial condition @xmath62 the renormalized regulator function , @xmath63 , is _ manifestly independent of @xmath6 _ : @xmath64 by construction , the value of @xmath65 is determined by experiment .",
    "one should emphasize an important point : in deriving eq.([eq:10 ] ) , use was made of assuming the regulator function has well defined derivatives with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "the theta function of the sharp cut - off , however , is a distribution with only ill defined derivatives .",
    "this raises an other important point : if @xmath66 is a function of @xmath67 other than a theta function , one must specify how the function approaches the limiting values of 1 and of 0 . the case of the ` soft ' regulator @xmath68",
    "is only a very special example . in a more general approach",
    "the soft regulator plays the role of a generating function @xmath69     \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2+q^2 }   \\;.\\label{eq:13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the partials @xmath70 are dimensionless and independent of a change in @xmath6 .",
    "the arbitrarily many coefficients @xmath71 are renormalization group invariants and , as such , subject to be determined by experiment .",
    "in a field theory , one is confronted with a many - body problem of the worst kind : not even the particle number is conserved . for to formulate effective hamiltonians more systematically ,",
    "a novel many - body technique had to be developed , the _ method of iterated resolvents _ @xcite , whose details are not important here .",
    "important is that the _ effective light - cone hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath72 has the same eigenvalue as the _ full light - cone hamiltonian _ @xmath53 and that it generates the bound state wave function of valence quarks by an one - body integral equation in ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 \\psi_{h_1h_2}(x,\\vec k_{\\!\\perp } ) -   % \\nonumber\\\\ & - &       { 1\\over 3\\pi^2 } \\sum _ { h_q^\\prime , h_{\\bar q}^\\prime }      \\!\\int\\!\\frac{dx^\\prime d^2 \\vec k_{\\!\\perp}^\\prime      \\",

    "is the formulation of an effective interaction by the method of iterated resolvents .",
    "as long as the assumption are not proven at least _ a posteriori _ , one must speak of an approach inspired by qcd .",
    "the probably strongest assumption in the present work , the simplifying singlet - triplet model , is also the one which can be relaxed the easiest in upcoming work . but its simplicity has been an advantage to unreveal the physical content of gauge theory by analytical relations .    the biggest progress of the present work is related to a consistent regularization and renormalization of a gauge theory .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences in gauge theory are caused less by the possibly large momenta of the constituent particles , but by the large momentum _",
    "transfers _ in the interaction . in a hamiltonian approach , such as the present",
    ", one has not much choice else than to chop them off by a regulating form factor in the elementary vertex interaction .",
    "the form factor makes its way into a regulator function which suppresses the large momentum transfers in the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the arbitrariness in chopping off the _ large momentum transfers _ is reflected in the arbitrariness of the potential at _ small relative distances_. it is this arbitrariness which allows for a potential pocket which binds the quarks in a hadron .",
    "the problem how to fix this arbitrariness by experiment , in practice , is less difficult than anti - cipated .",
    "it suffices to determine only three parameters : @xmath151 , @xmath153 , and @xmath147 .",
    "the potential energy of the present work vanishes at an infinite separation of the quarks .",
    "this seems be be in conflict with the potential energies of phenomenological models which rise forever .",
    "it also seems to be in conflict with lattice gauge calculations .",
    "is a finite ionization limit in conflict also with ` confinement ' , _ i.e. _ with the empirical fact that free quarks have not been observed ?  ",
    "the present model prohibits free quarks as a stable solution , since the sum of the constituent quark masses is always larger than the mass of the corresponding hadron and a pion .",
    "free constituent quarks would hadronize very quickly into bound states .",
    "this is different from atomic physics with its free constituents , where the binding energy is always much smaller than the mass of positronium proper .",
    "the most disturbing aspect of the present work is its obvious conflict with lattice gauge calculations .",
    "i have not checked to which extent a possible linear term in the potential spoils the present excellent agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy on the lattice rests on the assumptions of static quarks , of quarks with an infinitely large mass . even with present day computers",
    "lattice gauge calculations have a hard time in extrapolating them down to such light systems as the @xmath168 or the @xmath0 .",
