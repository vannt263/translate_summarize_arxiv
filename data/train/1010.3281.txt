    "<S> drops placed on a surface with a temperature above the leidenfrost point float atop an evaporative vapor layer . in this fluid dynamics video , it is shown that for roughened surfaces the leidenfrost point depends on the drop size , which runs contrary to previous claims of size independence . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the vapor layer is known to increase with drop radius , suggesting that the surface roughness will not be able to penetrate the vapor layer for drops above a critical size . </S>",
    "<S> this size dependence was experimentally verified : at a given roughness and temperature , drops beneath a critical size exhibited transition boiling while drops above the critical size were in the leidenfrost regime . </S>",
    "<S> these leidenfrost drops were unstable ; upon evaporation down to the critical size the vapor film suddenly collapsed . </S>"
