    "supernovae ( sne ) are among the most powerful explosions in the universe . in addition to type ia sne , which arise from the thermonuclear runaway explosion of a mass - accreting white dwarf star , there are sne that result from the collapse of the core at the endpoint of a massive ( with initial mass @xmath8 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "here we present photometry of the star and discuss its nature , including its likely initial mass .",
    "an analysis of the progenitor has also been conducted by @xcite . in their study , @xcite conclude that the rsg was observed through considerable visual extinction ( @xmath20 mag ) , and their estimates of the star s luminosity and initial mass span a fairly large range , @xmath21@xmath22 and 1426 m@xmath23 , respectively .    for the distance to the sn",

    "the sn site was imaged by _ hst _ in f439w , f555w , and f814w with the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) between 1994 december and 1995 january , as part of the _ hst _ key project to use cepheid - based distances to measure the value of the hubble constant ( go-5397 ; pi j.  mould ) .",

    "the total exposure times are 30130  s and 9830  s in these two bands , respectively .",
    "the hla did not produce mosaics at f439w ; the total exposure time is 5000  s for these four images .",

    "images of the sn were obtained on march 21.31 in the @xmath25 band in sets of exposures with times of 5  s and 10  s , under very good observing conditions ( @xmath26 ) , using the megacam on the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , to initially locate the sn position in the pre - sn archival _ hst _ images ( see below ) . from these images",
    "we also measured an absolute position for the sn of @xmath27(j2000 ) = @xmath28 , @xmath29(j2000 ) = @xmath30 ( @xmath31 root - mean square ) , relative to 12 stars in the field from the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite . to further refine the sn position , relative to the _ hst _ images",
    ", we obtained three sets of dithered near - infrared camera 2 ( nirc2 ) images of the sn in the @xmath32 band ( with exposure times 1.5 , 3 , and 10  s , respectively ) , using adaptive optics ( ao ) and the 10-m keck  ii telescope on march 27.42 .",
    "since the sn was quite bright at the time of these observations , it was possible to perform the ao using it as a natural guide star , so that the laser guide star was not necessary .    using the cfht images",
    ", we were able to locate a candidate progenitor star for the sn in the hla f814w image mosaic , with an error circle radius of @xmath33 pixel ( @xmath34 for these drizzled mosaics ) , the results of which were first presented by @xcite .",
    "for the keck ao imaging , from a coaddition of 40 individual 3  s frames ( no geometric distortion correction was applied prior to the coaddition ) in which the sn is only mildly saturated , we used 16 stars in common between this coadded mosaic and the hla f814w mosaic with the iraf task _ geomap _ to register the two mosaics with an uncertainty in the image transformation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 hla mosaic pixels ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ) .",
    "we find that the location of the sn and progenitor candidate are consistent to within the @xmath39 statistical uncertainty of our alignment procedure .",
    "we conclude that we have confirmed the candidate star seen in the wfpc2 mosaics as the probable progenitor of sn 2012aw .",
    "this is the same star that was identified by @xcite .    using dolphot v2.0 , as applied to wfpc2 data @xcite , we measured the apparent brightness of the progenitor from the ensemble of individual images in both f555w and f814w from go-5397 . for f555w",
    "we ultimately input into dolphot only the images which produced uncertainties in the photometry of @xmath40 mag ; in this band , the star is detected at only @xmath41 per individual exposure in the first place .",
    "we also omitted one f814w exposure which was appreciably noisier than all the others ( its exposure time was only 230  s , compared to 10001500  s for the other exposures in this band ) .",
    "we used one of the remaining f814w exposures ( the star is generally detected at @xmath42 per exposure ) as the astrometric reference image in dolphot .",
    "the output from dolphot automatically includes the transformation from flight - system f555w and f814w to the corresponding johnson - cousins @xcite magnitudes in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "( we refer to @xmath44 as @xmath45 hereafter . )",
    "we find that @xmath46 and @xmath47 mag .",
    "these flight - system magnitudes transform to @xmath48 and @xmath49 mag . although our measurement at f814w is identical to that obtained by @xcite , our measurement at f555w is brighter by @xmath50 than their value . for f336w and f439w",
    "the star was not detected by dolphot to @xmath51 and @xmath52 mag ( both @xmath53 ) .",
    "the measurements of the progenitor s apparent brightness ( or limits to the apparent brightness ) are summarized in table  [ tabprog ] .",
    "as @xcite discuss , there are also archival ground - based near - infrared images which contain the sn progenitor , namely those obtained at the european southern observatory ( eso ) , with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) on the 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) unit telescope 1 on 2000 march 26 and 27 ( pi f.  bresolin ) , and with the son of isaac ( sofi ) on the 3.6-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) on 2006 march 24 ( pi j.  ascenso ) .",
    "the isaac images we used were in the @xmath54 band , with 30  s individual frame times and four subintegrations ( coadditions ) in memory , and the sofi images were in the @xmath55 band , with 8  s frame times and 15 subintegrations .",
    "the progenitor site is also in @xmath55 images of the host galaxy , obtained as commissioning data on 2000 march 23 with the isaac newton group red imaging device ( ingrid ) on the wht .",
    "the results of that imaging have been reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calibrated their photometric analysis of the isaac and sofi datasets using 2mass stars in the images .",
    "the problem with this approach is that these stars are all near the photometric limit of the 2mass survey , @xmath56 mag for the isaac images and @xmath5715.5 mag for the sofi images . at this limit",
    "we expect the photometry to be far less reliable , as described in the 2mass explanatory supplement , and therefore calibration of the isaac and sofi image data using these stars could suffer from systematic effects , leading to a possible error in the final apparent magnitudes for the progenitor .",
    "we therefore reanalyzed the isaac and ingrid images , including the original calibration data for those observations , and reanalyzed the sofi images , applying the calibration at @xmath55 from the ingrid observations to those with sofi , employing five well - detected stars in common between the two datasets .",
    "this calibration should be valid , since the bandpasses of both the ingrid and sofi @xmath55 filters are quite similar .",
    "the data reduction of the raw frames followed standard procedures for near - infrared imaging .",
    "for the isaac , sofi , and ingrid data we first corrected the individual images for the instrumental response with a combined , normalized flat frame obtained in each band . for the isaac observations , twilight - sky frames had been obtained for this purpose ; for sofi observations , dome flats were obtained ; and for the ingrid observations , we produced a flat from a median - filtered combination of the off - source sky frames .",
    "we then subtracted from the on - source images a median - filtered combination of the sky frames . for each band a reference frame was chosen , all other frames were shifted in pixel space relative to the reference , and the shifted frames were coadded , together with the reference frame , to produce a single image mosaic . for the march 26 isaac data we coadded 16 individual @xmath54 frames , and for the march 27 we coadded 17 frames . for the sofi @xmath55 imaging we coadded all 5 on - source frames . for the ingrid imaging we coadded 9 of the 20  s frames that contained the progenitor site",
    "we extracted photometry from all of the image mosaics using point - spread function ( psf ) fitting in iraf / daophot @xcite .",
    "the progenitor star was detected in the @xmath54 mosaics from the two isaac nights at a signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath58 ) of @xmath5935 , whereas the star was detected in both the sofi and ingrid mosaics at only @xmath60 .",
    "we measured aperture photometry using iraf for the calibration - star observations obtained for both the isaac and ingrid runs . for isaac these consisted of various @xcite standard stars observed on both nights .",
    "for both 2000 march 26 and 27 we found solutions with airmass corrections of @xmath610.105 mag airmass@xmath11 , essentially the canonical correction at @xmath62 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the root - mean square uncertainty in the solution was 0.002 mag for march 28 and a slightly higher 0.009 mag for march 27 ) .",
    "we therefore measured @xmath63 mag on march 26 and @xmath64 mag on march 27 for the progenitor .",
    "we note that , although the images are in @xmath54 , while the photometric standard magnitudes are in the las campanas observatory ( lco ) @xmath65 band @xcite , we analyzed the synthetic photometry of three of these standard stars ( p041-c , p177-d , and p330-e ) , for which there are also _ hst _ calibration spectra , and the magnitudes for these stars are only about 0.02 mag brighter through @xmath54 than @xmath65 ; we also find that for the likely spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the probable progenitor star ( see below ) , the progenitor itself would be about 0.05 mag brighter in @xmath54 than in @xmath65 .",
    "( we hereafter refer to @xmath65 merely as @xmath62 . )",
    "we have added this latter difference as an additional uncertainty in quadrature with the uncertainty in the photometric measurement .",
    "the uncertainty - weighted mean of the two measurements is @xmath66 mag .    for the ingrid calibration , two united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) faint standards @xcite , fs14 and fs21 , had each been observed at the low airmasses which bracketed the observations of m95 .",
    "we obtained aperture photometry of these two stars and calibrated the faint daophot photometry of the progenitor star accordingly .",
    "we note that the @xmath55 bandpass used for these observations is in the mauna kea observatory ( mko ) system @xcite .",
    "the star s brightness in this band is then @xmath67 mag . applying the calibration of the ingrid data to the sofi image mosaic ,",
    "as previously described , we obtain @xmath68 mag for the progenitor .",
    "the uncertainty - weighted mean of these two measurements is @xmath69 mag .",
    "we summarize the measurements of the progenitor s near - infrared brightness in table  [ tabprog ] .",
    "although , in the end , our measurements at @xmath62 and @xmath55 agree with those obtained by @xcite to within the uncertainties in their photometry , we were able to achieve a higher precision in our measurements and were able to reduce the uncertainties substantially through the standard - star calibrations .",
    "unlike the lower - luminosity rsgs which are progenitors of low - luminosity sne  ii - p , such as sn 2008bk @xcite , @xcite pointed out that we would expect higher - luminosity rsgs to lose mass at a significantly higher rate , and that this mass loss results in circumstellar shells where dust tends to form .",
    "we already have an indication that this rsg was of high luminosity , from its @xmath70-band brightness ; even neglecting extinction ( which , in the first place , at @xmath70 is typically nearly a factor of 10 less than at @xmath43 ) and assuming a bolometric correction @xmath71 mag , the bolometric magnitude for the star would be @xmath72 .",
    "what is striking about this progenitor detection is that the star is sufficiently luminous to be easily visible in both the _ hst _ f814w image and the ground - based near - infrared images .",
    "another interesting facet is the relative isolation of the progenitor in the host galaxy ; it is apparently far from any noticeable cluster , ob association , or h  ii region .",
    "most likely , this isolation largely contributes to the detectability of the star at the distance of the host galaxy , since the star s environment is uncrowded .",
    "furthermore , it is tempting to speculate that , like the famous galactic rsg betelgeuse ( @xmath27 orionis ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sn 2012aw progenitor could also have been a stellar runaway .",
    "it is known that rsgs can be semiregular or irregular variable stars .",
    "@xcite analyzed the optical variability of 48 galactic rsgs and found evidence for two modes of variability in 18 of the stars ( e.g. , @xmath27 ori ) , one mode with periods of a few hundred days and one of a few thousand days .",
    "concern therefore should exist whether the apparent brightnesses that we have measured in the various bands , especially the ensemble from the _ hst _ images , are representative of the star s actual brightness . whereas variability at @xmath43 can be considerable , up to a magnitude or more , rsgs show essentially no variability at @xmath70 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the _ hst _ data for m95 were obtained over a number of epochs spanning @xmath73  d ( those data were originally taken to discover and measure the periods of cepheids in the host galaxy ) , so we can analyze the multi - epoch photometry for any indication of short - period variability of the progenitor in 1994/1995 , @xmath518 yr prior to the explosion . in figure  [ figvar ]",
    "we show the individual measurements with dolphot from the _ hst_/wfpc2 images in both f555w and f814w . for _ hst _ observations which were made on essentially the same julian date ,",
    "we have computed an uncertainty - weighted mean value for the star s brightness and show those in the figure , rather than the two individual measurements for a given date .",
    "this was particularly the case for the f814w measurements .",
    "we also show estimates of the color from three epochs .",
    "clearly excursions of the measurements exist , relative to the mean brightness for the star in each band , with total apparent variations of @xmath74 mag and @xmath75 mag .",
    "we must determine the significance of these variations .",
    "for that we have computed the reduced @xmath76 statistic in each band , and find for f555w , @xmath77 , and for f814w , @xmath78 .",
    "we can also assess the @xmath79 value of these two statistics ; a @xmath79 value of 0.05 or less is usually regarded as statistically significant ( i.e. , the observed deviation from the mean is significant ) .",
    "for f555w we find @xmath80 , and for f814w , @xmath81 .",
    "we therefore consider it likely that the variability we observe is real .",
    "we note that @xcite seemingly dismiss the possibility of variability in either band .",
    "the mean color is already @xmath82 mag redder in @xmath83 than the color of an early - m supergiant in the absence of dust .",
    "the variation in the star s color is @xmath84 mag , relative to the mean .",
    "we clearly do not have spectra of the star , so we can not determine whether the color variation represents true changes in the star s effective temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or merely variations in the line - of - sight dust .",
    "if the former , the color variations would correspond to variations in the mean effective temperature of @xmath85 k.    although the progenitor shows considerable variability over the @xmath73  d at @xmath86 , which would be consistent with variations in the dust content of the star s circumstellar material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more limited variability at @xmath87 , we will assume that the mean brightness at both @xmath43 and @xmath45 over this timescale is representative of the star s brightness over far longer timescales , at least through the year 2000 , when the @xmath62 and @xmath55 brightness were sampled .",
    "we would expect the @xmath55 brightness to have been relatively constant .",
    "we have no insight into the level of variability at @xmath62 , but we might expect it to be considerably less than at @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore assume that the progenitor s observed brightness in all of these bands fairly represents the actual sed of the star .",
    "assuming the oxygen abundance can serve as a proxy for the overall metallicity in the host galaxy , we estimated the metallicity at the sn site based on the gradient in the disk of m95 of the o abundance measured by @xcite .",
    "we deprojected the megacam image , assuming the values for the position angle and inclination for m95 from @xcite , and measured the radial offset of the sn position from the nuclear position . for a plate scale of @xmath88 pixel@xmath11",
    ", we find that this offset is @xmath89 , or @xmath90 . again , assuming the radial offset at 25 @xmath91 mag arcsec@xmath92 for m95 from @xcite , i.e. , @xmath93 , we then calculate that @xmath94 . at this scaled nuclear offset , assuming the abundance in @xcite  derived from the strong - line index calibration by @xcite , we find that 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath95 in the sn environment . given that the solar value is 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath96 @xcite , we infer that the metallicity at the sn site is only slightly subsolar and likely still consistent with solar , given the uncertainties .",
    "we therefore analyze our results assuming solar metallicity .      from the relatively high apparent brightness at @xmath55 for the star , compared to the relative faintness at @xmath43 , we realized that the reddening to the progenitor had to be high , likely due to circumstellar dust .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the effective total - to - selective ratio of absorption , @xmath97 , for the dust around galactic rsgs should differ considerably from the @xmath1 typical of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may imply a difference , for example , in the grain - size distribution in these shells .",
    "they found from their sample of rsgs that @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the surface gravity of the rsg and has values of between @xmath100 and 0.5 ( when @xmath101 is expressed in cgs units ) .",
    "we compared the observed sed for the progenitor to a model sed synthesized using stsdas / synphot within iraf from the marcs model stellar atmospheres for rsgs at solar metallicity @xcite with @xmath102 in the range 34003800 k ( essentially , spectral types of m5 through late k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in steps of 100 k , and surface gravities @xmath103 , 0.0 , and @xmath104 .",

    "the filter response function at @xmath62 in the lco system is taken from @xcite , and the function for @xmath55 in the mko system is from the online ingrid instrument page .",
    "we allowed @xmath97 to vary from the typical value of 3.1 to larger values and computed a range of @xmath105 from 1.4 to 4.2 mag for each @xmath97 , following @xcite .",
    "we were able to eliminate the @xmath106 models outright , since none of these were able to reproduce the observed sed at any value of @xmath97 , @xmath105 , and @xmath102 .",
    "for all of the models at the other two surface gravities , we found that only the @xmath107 k models were allowed within the uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "furthermore , we found that for the @xmath103 models , a range in @xmath97 from 4.0 to 4.7 was allowed , although the range in @xmath105 was constrained to 3.053.10 mag .",
    "for the @xmath108 models , @xmath97 could range from 4.1 to 4.6 , and again , the extinction was constrained to @xmath1093.15 mag .    the total @xmath105 in this case can be considered an excess extinction , due to circumstellar dust , together with the line - of - sight extinction to the star , which we assume to be the total extinction to the sn ( see   [ sndust ] ) . since we have shown that the star was variable , possibly due to variations in the amount of circumstellar dust , this total @xmath105 is essentially a time - averaged value over the duration of both the _ hst _ and ground - based observations .",
    "the average values of @xmath97 and @xmath105 ( in mag ) for the models at both surface gravities are 4.35 and 3.10 , respectively .",
    "we show in figure  [ figsed ] a representative model at @xmath110 k with these values of @xmath97 and @xmath105 .",
    "the tightest constraint on the model seds comes from the @xmath45-band measurement ; the large uncertainty at @xmath55 , on the other hand , is not as constraining . from @xcite",
    ", this effective temperature would correspond to spectral type m3 .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we computed the bolometric corrections at @xmath43 , @xmath45 , and @xmath55 from the marcs rsg stellar atmosphere models at @xmath107 k and at @xmath103 and @xmath108 .",

    "it is very satisfying that our estimates of @xmath121 are exactly the same at @xmath43 and @xmath45 , which gives us confidence that the values for @xmath97 , @xmath105 , @xmath102 , and @xmath99 , taken together , are all consistent .",
    "it also allows us to neglect @xmath121 obtained from the far less certain @xmath55 measurement , although the value of @xmath121 from this band certainly agrees with those from the other two bands , to within the uncertainties .",
    "we therefore adopt the uncertainty - weighted mean , @xmath122 mag , from @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "we conservatively adopt an uncertainty of @xmath123 k in @xmath102 , although the star s observed sed appears to tightly constrain the effective temperature of the star to less than this uncertainty .",
    "assuming @xmath124 = 4.74 mag , this corresponds to a bolometric luminosity relative to the sun of @xmath125 .    in figure  [ fighrd ]",
    "we show a hertzsprung - russell diagram with the locus of the sn 2012aw progenitor . for comparison we also illustrate the massive - star evolutionary tracks at solar metallicity from @xcite for stars with initial rotation which is 40% of the critical rotation , at initial masses @xmath126 and 20 m@xmath23 .",
    "the star is clearly more luminous than the rsg terminus of the @xmath127 model , although the star s effective temperature is consistent with the value for the terminus of this model .",
    "the 20 m@xmath23 model , however , terminates at a higher luminosity and far hotter @xmath102 .",
    "the `` red loop '' of that track does approach the star s locus ; however , based on the behavior of that track , we do not expect a star with this initial mass prematurely to reach its endpoint at this luminosity and cooler effective temperature along the loop .",
    "we can infer , therefore , that the progenitor s initial mass was in the range @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite do not provide model tracks between @xmath126 and 20 m@xmath23 , so it is unclear at what luminosity and effective temperature stars with initial masses within this range would reach their termini .",
    "however , by eye from the figure , we can interpolate that the star s locus could well be consistent with the endpoints of a putative 17 or @xmath6 track .",
    "clearly , we require the actual model track to be more precise about this initial mass assignment .    at the adopted effective temperature and luminosity , the star had an effective radius @xmath128 . from the @xcite @xmath127 evolutionary track ,",
    "the final mass is @xmath129 , so the surface gravity would then be @xmath130 . from the adopted @xmath105 and @xmath97 , the reddening @xmath131 mag .",
    "we then would expect , from the relation from @xcite between @xmath97 , @xmath132 , and @xmath99 , that @xmath133 .",
    "this indicates that there is consistency among these three parameters taken together , and this cross - check further provides us with confidence in our estimates of the star s properties .",
    "we note that the main difference between the analysis we have presented here and that presented by @xcite  namely , that we are able to better constrain the effective temperature , luminosity , and , therefore , the initial mass estimate for the progenitor  stems not only from the differences in the photometry between the two studies ( we found that the star is brighter in @xmath43 , and we were also able to reduce the uncertainties at @xmath62 and @xmath55 ) , but also from our assumption that @xmath134 for the rsg progenitor was different from the typical value of 3.1 for the diffuse ism .",
    "one item to also note is that the evolutionary tracks ( without rotation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) employed by @xcite tend to terminate at significantly cooler effective temperatures than the @xcite tracks that we have used .",
    "the key , ultimately , was connecting the inferred properties of the sn 2012aw progenitor , based on our measurements , to those of the galactic rsgs of similar luminosity and mass @xcite .      as @xcite discussed , we can estimate the mass of the dust and duration of dust production that is responsible for the excess extinction which we infer for the rsg progenitor .",
    "@xcite  assume a thin - shell approximation for the excess extinction , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the stellar radius ( in m ) , @xmath137 is the extent of the thin dust layer or shell ( or the path length through the dust ) above the stellar surface , and @xmath138 is the dust mass ( in kg ) .",
    "the circumstellar matter presumably extended several stellar radii above the star s surface , as in the case of @xmath27 ori , and the overall mass loss could well have been driven by convection in the envelope @xcite .",
    "it is in the last @xmath139  yr of the rsg phase , as seen in the @xmath140 model from @xcite , when the star s luminosity , radius , and total mass loss particularly increase . from figure 4 of @xcite",
    ", we see that the inferred @xmath141 mag ( we will show in   [ sndust ] that the interstellar extinction , for @xmath1 , is likely only @xmath142 mag ) is entirely consistent with the @xmath121 of the star .",
    "the dust production rate , @xmath143 , corresponding to this luminosity is @xmath144 yr@xmath11 . from the relation above ,",
    "the value of @xmath138 is @xmath145 kg . comparing this to @xmath146 , we find that a dust - producing episode of @xmath147 yr , at some point prior to 1994 ( since this dust already existed by the time of the first _ hst_/wfpc2 images ) , could account for @xmath148 .",
    "although quite a short interval of time , it is consistent with that inferred for episodic dust production in galactic rsgs @xcite .",
    "however brief was the dust production , as @xcite point out , the dust was far more quickly destroyed , likely by the x - ray / uv flash within hours of core collapse . as also noted by @xcite ,",
    "such circumstellar dust destruction is not unprecedented for other sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have found that the na  i  d feature strength in low - resolution optical sn spectra is a poor indicator of the amount of extinction to the sn .",
    "however , @xcite have established a well - calibrated relation between reddening and the equivalent width ( ew ) of the na  i  d doublet , d1 and d2 , based on more than one hundred high - resolution spectra of objects through a number of interstellar lines - of - sight .",
    "we have therefore measured the ew of the doublet , from both the milky way and host - galaxy components , as clearly detected in a high - resolution spectrum of sn 2012aw we obtained with the high resolution echelle spectrometer @xcite on the 10 m keck  i telescope in the red optics configuration ( `` hiresr '' ) on 2012 april 10.29 .",
    "we used the c2 decker ( i.e. , the @xmath149 slit ) , providing coverage of @xmath150 38007300   with a resolution of 50,000 .",
    "the portion of this spectrum , centered around the na  i  d feature , is shown in figure  [ fighires ] .",
    "we find that for the milky way component , ew(d2@xmath1515891.41 ) = @xmath152 m  and ew(d1@xmath1515897.39 ) = @xmath153 m .",
    "for the component internal to m95 , ew(d2@xmath1515909.33 ) = @xmath154 m  and ew(d1@xmath1515915.32 ) = @xmath155 m .",
    "uncertainties in the centroids of the absorption features are typically @xmath156  .",
    "( these are all vacuum wavelengths , corrected to a heliocentric frame of reference . ) the features due to m95 , particularly , the d2 component and , to a lesser extent , the d1 component , may be slightly saturated .    from the @xcite relations , @xmath157 mag from the milky way and @xmath158 mag for the host galaxy .",
    "( the uncertainties here are primarily from the systematic uncertainties in the relations ; the measurement uncertainties are comparatively negligible . )",
    "these relations take into account saturation in the features , which is a smaller effect compared to the systematic uncertainties in the relations .",
    "our reddening estimate is consistent with the galactic foreground reddening estimate from @xcite , @xmath159 mag .",
    "the total reddening indicated from the high - resolution sn spectrum , assuming @xmath1 , is then @xmath160 mag , which is relatively low and comparable to the estimated @xmath161 mag found for sn 1999em @xcite .",
    "the visual extinction to the sn is then @xmath7 mag .",
    "although @xcite found that for a sample of sne  ii - p the best - fit @xmath162 , the relations from @xcite likely do not depend strongly on @xmath134 , and therefore the reddening and extinction values we have estimated likely will not be significantly different if @xmath163 , especially local to the sn . nonetheless , it is evident that the sn explosion must have destroyed much or all of the circumstellar dust around the progenitor , leaving only what is most likely interstellar line - of - sight extinction , which we measured from the high - resolution sn spectrum .",
    "the probable progenitor of the intermediate - luminosity sn  ii - p 2012aw / ptf12bvh has been identified in archival _ hst _ optical and ground - based near - infrared images . using the photometry extracted from those images",
    "we have constructed a sed for the star , and we analyze the sed to show that the star was a luminous ( @xmath164 mag ) rsg with spectral type m3 ( @xmath107 k ) and with substantial circumstellar dust up to 18  yr before explosion .",
    "this dust was clearly destroyed by the explosion , since the current extinction to the sn is relatively low .",
    "although the existing , state - of - the - art , theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks do not terminate at the locus of the star in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , we surmise that the star had an initial mass @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "this mass is essentially the same as the upper limit to the initial mass , @xmath165 , that @xcite derived for sn  ii - p progenitors .",
    "it is not evident whether this result for sn 2012aw can be generalized for other intermediate - luminosity sne  ii - p .",
    "the initial mass for the progenitor of sn 2004et is still a subject of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , the ( @xmath166 ) upper limit to the detection of sn 1999em at @xmath167 mag from @xcite , at a distance of 11.7 mpc ( @xcite , which implies a luminosity limit only a factor @xmath168 fainter than if sn 1999em were at 10.0 mpc , as is sn 2012aw ) , precludes detection of an analog to the sn 2012aw progenitor .",
    "it therefore remains uncertain what is the upper limit on the initial mass of the rsgs that give rise to `` normal , '' intermediate - luminosity sne  ii - p .",
    "the detected , unusual progenitors of high - luminosity sne  ii - p ( e.g. , sn 2008cn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may provide some indication of this limit .",
    "the recent stellar evolutionary tracks from @xcite , as well as those with pulsationally driven superwinds by @xcite , demonstrate the role of rotation and mass loss in the late - stage evolution of stars with @xmath169 .",
    "still to be investigated more fully are the influences of factors such as the metallicity and binarity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to verify the candidate sn 2012aw progenitor",
    ", we will need to return at very late times , when the sn has substantially faded , to see whether the dusty rsg has vanished .",
