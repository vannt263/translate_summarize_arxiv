    "wormhole physics has been an interesting subject for physicists since the first traversable wormhole by morris and throne as a solution of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "the fascinating idea was to connect two distinct or the same universe through a handel or tunnel @xcite . the main issue with this wormhole is the existence of inevitable amount of exotic matter around the throat .",
    "the problem of minimizing the usage of exotic matter for the physically viability of wormhole has received a considerable attention .",
    "for instance , it was shown that with suitable choice of wormhole geometry @xcite , it is possible to reduce exotic matter around the wormhole throat .",
    "visser @xcite analyzed that the violation of energy condition could be minimized with the construction of thin - shell wormholes through cut and paste technique .",

    "afterwards , the same analysis was extended for charge @xcite and cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "it was found that the stability regions would be increased with the inclusion of charge and positive cosmological constant while decreased for the negative cosmological constant .",
