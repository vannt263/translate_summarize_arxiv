    "the moments of inertia of deformed atomic nuclei at low spins are a factor of two or three smaller than the rigid - body value .",
    "the reduction is attributed to the strong pair correlations , because nuclei in the ground state are in a superfluid condensed state @xcite .",
    "angular momentum is generated by either rotating the deformed superfluid or by breaking cooper pairs from this condensed state . in order to reach high spins , an increasing number of cooper pairs",
    "are broken , which reduces and finally quenches the pair condensate .",
    "it has been often stated that after this transition , the moments of inertia should reach the rigid - body value  @xcite . however , this conjecture is based on the consideration of two special cases  @xcite : ( i ) the limit of large particle number , where the nuclear shell structure becomes unimportant ; and ( ii ) nucleons in a harmonic oscillator potential at its equilibrium deformation .    particularly for independent particles in a harmonic oscillator potential well ,",
    "the moment of inertia has in the limit of vanishing angular velocity exactly the rigid - body value in any combination of stationary single - particle states provided the total energy is stationary with respect to volume - conserving variations of the equipotential ellipsoids  @xcite . at finite angular velocity , the condition for the rigid - body value is that the second moments of the density distribution should have the ratio of the squares of the axes of the oscillator - plus - centrifugal equipotential ellipsoids , which is not exactly equivalent to a stationary energy  @xcite .",
    "these results have led to the expectation that in real nuclei , the moment of inertia would not be very different from the rigid - body value if the pairing is quenched .",
    "this expectation was substantiated by early studies like , for example , that in ref.@xcite of more realistic single - nucleon potentials , which seemed to indicate that permitting the nuclear system to relax to an equilibrium shape generally tends to reduce deviations from the rigid - body moment of inertia due to shell structure .",
    "the validity of the aforementioned conjecture for the real nuclear potential remains , however , a continuing subject of investigation with new theoretical and experimental techniques , and so does the related question of the current distribution in a rotating nucleus  @xcite .",
    "systematic deviations from rigid - like behavior at high angular velocity have been demonstrated for transitional nuclei in the a@xmath0110 region  @xcite and discussed for superdeformed nuclei  @xcite . in the present study",
    "we address the inertial behavior of a different class of nuclear excitations : high - seniority states in well deformed a@xmath0180 nuclei ( see also the earlier work by andersson  et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . recently",
    ", rotational bands have been observed in , for example , @xmath1hf , @xmath1w and  @xmath2w  @xcite that are built on configurations with up to four broken pairs ( that is , seniority eight ) and high @xmath3 values , where @xmath3 is the angular momentum with respect to the body - fixed deformation axis . it is found ( see the empirical data in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] ) that the moments of inertia are substantially below the rigid - body value .",
    "furthermore , some bands deviate from the linear dependence of the angular momentum on the angular velocity , expected for the strong coupling of quasiparticles to the deformed field .",
    "these features can be explained  @xcite by the persistence of pair correlations in the lipkin - nogami pairing model , combined with the assumption that the zero - pairing limit would result in rigid - like rotation .",
    "however , since the latter assumption is not self - evident , a microscopic determination of the moment of inertia in the zero - pairing limit is required . in the present work it is demonstrated , through tilted - axis - cranking ( tac ) calculations , that the main experimental features can be understood by assuming that nucleons move in a rotating mean field with _ no pairing_. the preliminary results of ref .",
    "@xcite are extended .",
    "to describe the high-@xmath3 rotational bands , involving many unpaired nucleons and predominant magnetic dipole transitions , the tilted - axis - cranking approach  @xcite is employed .",
    "when pairing is neglected , the nuclear state @xmath4 considered is a uniformly rotating slater determinant which is an eigenstate of the `` routhian '' @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of independent nucleons in a deformed potential , @xmath7 is the angular velocity , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the components of the angular momentum with respect to the principal axes 1 and 3 ( symmetry axis ) of the deformed potential , and @xmath10 the angle of the angular velocity with the 3-axis .",
    "the total routhian @xmath11 is obtained by applying the strutinsky renormalization to the energy of the non - rotating system @xmath12 .",
    "this kind of approach has turned out to be a quite reliable calculation scheme in the case of standard cranking  @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath13 by means of strutinsky - averaging  @xcite , the smooth energy @xmath14 is calculated from the non - rotating single - nucleon energies , obtained from the hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "the orientation angle @xmath10 is found by requiring the total angular momentum @xmath16 to be parallel to @xmath17 .",
    "this makes @xmath11 a minimum with respect to @xmath10 . in the case of the high - k bands we are interested in ,",
    "the rotational axis is `` tilted '' , i. e. it does not coincide with one of the principal axes of the deformed potential ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the equilibrium shape is found by minimizing @xmath11 with respect to the deformation parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the potential .",
    "the calculated angular momentum @xmath21 is compared with the corresponding experimental function , which is constructed by the standard procedure : in terms of the energy levels @xmath22 of a @xmath23 rotational band , where @xmath24 denotes the angular momentum quantum number , one sets @xmath25 for @xmath26 . for a given observed band ,",
    "this defines a discrete set of empirical pairs of @xmath27 and @xmath7 from which the experimental function @xmath28 is obtained by interpolation .",
    "( taking @xmath29 at @xmath30 simulates an rpa - correction to the hartree - fock energy  @xcite ) .",
    "in the present calculation for the nuclei @xmath1hf , @xmath1w and  @xmath2w , the modified oscillator form  @xcite of the hamiltonian @xmath6 was adopted . for the combinations of single - nucleon states listed in table  [ table ] , the equilibrium shape at zero angular velocity was    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    determined .",
    "most of the configurations in @xmath1w and  @xmath2w were found to have equilibrium values of the quadrupole deformation @xmath19 and hexadecapole deformation @xmath20 ( see  ref .",
    "@xcite ) close to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "only the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 configurations , which have a proton in the @xmath35 state , have somewhat larger equilibrium deformations , given approximately by @xmath36 and  @xmath37 . in the @xmath38 configuration in @xmath1hf",
    ", the equilibrium shape has @xmath39 and  @xmath40 .",
    "these values of the shape parameters were used in the following calculations .",
    "the difference between the deformation of the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 configurations and that of the other configurations in @xmath1w and  @xmath2w changes the rigid - body moment of inertia by 6% .",
    "for the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 configurations , we studied the change of equilibrium shape as a function of the angular velocity . in the relevant interval of @xmath7 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath19 stays below 0.005 and that of @xmath20 is negligible .",
    "this corresponds to a 2% variation of the rigid - body moment of inertia .",
    "figure  [ unpaired ] shows the calculated and empirical functions @xmath28 for the configurations in table  [ table ] except those with @xmath41 and  @xmath42 .",
    "a close correspondence between calculation and data is apparent from this figure .",
    "this includes recent data for a @xmath43 band in @xmath1w  @xcite .",
    "it is also evident that the moments of inertia are considerably smaller than the rigid - body value , which is about 85  mev@xmath44 for these masses and shapes .",
    "the typical empirical moment of inertia is about 55  mev@xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 bands are discussed later .",
    "this strong deviation from the behavior of the moment of inertia in the limit of large particle number  @xcite may be understood from the details of the shell structure at prolate deformation .",
    "thus , the upper and middle parts of the 5082 proton and 82126 neutron shells , where the fermi levels are situated in these nuclei ( with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , have a concentration of orbitals that are strongly coupled to the deformed potential .",
    "this inhibits the generation of total angular momentum by alignment of the angular momenta of the individual nucleons with the 1-axis .",
    "the result is a moment of inertia that is smaller than the average .",
    "the effect is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ vectors ] , which shows that in comparison with the weakly coupled @xmath35 proton orbital , the angular momentum of the strongly coupled orbitals tends to stay closely aligned with the 3-axis , and for some orbitals even slightly antialigned with the 1-axis .",
    "in contrast , moments of inertia above the average are expected for nuclei with fermi levels in the lower parts of the major shells .",
    "such a variation was actually found through the 82126 neutron shell in the detailed calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite . with increasing deformation , the shell structure , and hence its contribution to the moment of inertia ,",
    "is progressively damped  @xcite .",
    "less pronounced deviations from the rigid - body value are therefore expected for superdeformed nuclei .",
    "it should be noted that the substantial deviations from the rigid - body moment of inertia seen in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] occur at the calculated equilibrium shape of each configuration .",
    "a similar experience applies to the magnetic susceptibility of small metal clusters  @xcite , which have a flat - bottom single - particle potential like that of atomic nuclei .",
    "the deviation from the rigid - body moment of inertia reflects a non - rigid flow of mass in the rotational states .",
    "such intrinsic mass currents have been discussed for atomic nuclei by several authors  @xcite as well as for small metal clusters  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath38 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and  @xmath49 bands is well described in terms of a constant moment of inertia of each configuration with a value about 55  mev@xmath44 .",
    "such a constant moment of inertia corresponds to the familiar expression for the energy levels in a rotational band built on a strongly coupled intrinsic state , @xmath50 , and it indicates a collective origin of the angular momentum with respect to the 1-axis .    the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 bands show a totally different behavior with a large up - curvature of the function @xmath28 .",
    "asymptotically , in the limit of large angular velocity , the moments of inertia approach values similar to those of the other bands . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this behavior results from the presence of a @xmath35 proton orbital in the configurations of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands .",
    "in fact , as the component @xmath51 of the angular velocity becomes finite , this weakly coupled orbital , which intrudes from the the @xmath52 spherical shell , immediately aligns its angular momentum with the 1-axis , thus making a significant contribution to the component @xmath53 of the total angular momentum on the 1-axis .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vectors ] .",
    "the functions @xmath54 actually calculated for these two bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ h9half ] .",
    "corresponding empirical functions were extracted from the    data by assuming , in close accordance with what is calculated , that @xmath55 is constant and equal to @xmath3 , i. e. @xmath56 in the empirical range of @xmath51 , both the calculated and the measured functions are seen to be fairly linear , and extrapolating these parts of the curves to @xmath57 yields the common value @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "[ h9half ] ) .    in order to see how the behavior of the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 bands seen in fig .",
    "[ unpaired ] may emerge from this picture , consider an idealized scenario where the @xmath35 proton orbital makes a constant contribution @xmath59 to @xmath53 , and all orbitals together a constant contribution to @xmath55 equal to @xmath3 and a contribution to @xmath53 equal to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "( such a schematic model is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ pr ] ) . with @xmath62 and ( [ om1 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath63 whence @xmath7 is seen to become smaller than the frequency @xmath64 for strong coupling ( @xmath65 ) .    in the calculation",
    ", there is a gradual increase of the contribution @xmath59 to @xmath53 of the @xmath35 proton orbital towards it maximum 9/2 .",
    "thus , the assumption above of a constant @xmath59 was too schematic .",
    "the calculated curves show a slight down - curvature due to saturation of @xmath59",
    ". the absence of a similar down - curvature in the data might be the result of a counteractive non - linearity of the remaining , collective , part of @xmath53 .",
    "in that case , the present calculation does not get this part quite right and overestimates the collective moment of inertia by about 5  mev@xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , these considerations show that ( i ) the essential difference of behavior , induced by the alignment with the 1-axis of the angular momentum of the @xmath35 proton , can be well understood , and ( ii ) the collective part @xmath61 is about 55  mev@xmath44 , like for the other bands .",
    "the calculations for zero pairing , and their comparison with experimental data , constitute the principal outcome of this work . however , it is also instructive to investigate some finite - pairing effects and other model assumptions .",
    "pairing is taken into account  @xcite by including the pair field in the quasiparticle routhian @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the monopole pair operator and @xmath68 is the particle number . in order to keep the notation simple we do not distinguish between the proton and neutron parts of the pair field .",
    "the rotating deformed state is obtained by replacing the slater determinant by the quasiparticle configuration @xmath4 , which is the eigenstate of ( [ qp ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 with this new state @xmath4 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath71 is fixed by requiring @xmath72 to be equal to the actual particle number , and the pair gap @xmath73 by the self - consistency condition @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "this formalism is equivalent to the previous one .",
    "the pairing force constants @xmath76 and @xmath77 were determined by the condition that the pair gaps in the nuclear ground state should be equal to the empirical odd - even mass differences .",
    "it is well known from previous studies ( for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that with increasing angular velocity , the pair gaps and chemical potentials change their values essentially stepwise with a successive breaking of cooper pairs .",
    "since a detailed description of the paired state is not the concern of this paper , the chemical potentials and pair gaps were kept constant for each configuration as long as there was no pair breaking encountered .",
    "the pair gaps determined at the band heads are listed in table  [ table ] . for most of the configurations ,",
    "they are seen to vanish .",
    "exceptions are the @xmath41 and  @xmath42 states .",
    "these have a common neutron configuration with one broken cooper pair , which leaves a reduced but finite neutron pair gap .",
    "the @xmath41 state furthermore has the ground - state proton configuration and hence the ground - state proton pair gap .",
    "the proton configuration of the @xmath78 state is found in the calculation to be just on the border of having a static proton pair field .",
    "small variations of @xmath77 about the value obtained by adjustment to the odd - even mass difference in fact cause @xmath79 to vary between 0 and  0.5  mev . for the calculations , we have chosen @xmath80 , as also listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "this gives a good agreement with the measured function @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ bcs ] shows the functions @xmath28 calculated for the @xmath41 and  @xmath42 bands .",
    "both of them are seen to bend upwards near @xmath81  mev .",
    "this is because , by breaking a cooper pair , two neutrons in @xmath82 orbitals align their angular momenta with the 1-axis . for @xmath83  mev ,",
    "a vanishing pair gap is calculated for this neutron configuration .",
    "therefore , we let in the figure the curves calculated with the neutron pair gap at the band head join for @xmath83  mev those calculated with @xmath84 .",
    "these are about 2 units below the measured curves in this range of @xmath7 .",
    "we could not find a reason for the discrepancy .",
    "this pair breaking is of the type known as a @xmath85-crossing ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as also seen from fig .",
    "[ bcs ] , no similar upbends arise in the case @xmath84 .",
    "this conforms to the general experience  @xcite that a static pair field is required for band crossings of the types @xmath86 , @xmath85 , etc .. thus , the presence of upbends in the data is evidence for a static neutron pair field in these bands .",
    "near the critical point of the vanishing of the static pair gap , large fluctuations of the pair field , known as dynamic pair correlations , are expected  @xcite .",
    "dynamic pair correlations are taken into account in an approximate way by the lipkin - nogami correction for the fluctuation of particle number in the bcs state .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . for several configurations , we made the lipkin - nogami calculation at the band head .",
    "the resulting lipkin - nogami pair gaps are also shown in table  [ table ] . with these gaps ,",
    "@xmath28 was calculated as in the case of static pairing ( see sec .  [ static ] ) , except that the chemical potentials were adjusted with the angular velocity so as to keep the correct expectation values of the proton and neutron numbers .",
    "the calculated functions @xmath28 for the @xmath87 and  @xmath34 bands shown in fig .",
    "[ ln ] are representative for the results .",
    "it is seen that relative to the calculation without pairing , the pair fields produced by the lipkin - nogami pair gaps make only minor corrections to the angular momentum ( of the order of 1 unit ) , which do not improve the agreement with experiment .",
    "thus , pair fluctuations appear to be inessential for the explanation of the observed deviations from the rigid value of the moments of inertia at high values of @xmath3 .",
    "this result may seem to be at variance with the investigation of low-@xmath3 bands in refs .",
    "there it was found that at frequencies where the static pair gap is zero the pair fluctuations reduce the angular momentum by 34 units in the yrast band of even - even nuclei . the different sensitivity to the pair correlations may be understood . in order to generate the angular momentum along the 3-axis ( high @xmath3 )",
    "several pairs are broken .",
    "this blocks the affected single particle states from taking part in the pair correlations .",
    "however , it is just the contribution of these particles near the fermi surface which is most sensitive to the pair correlations . in the case of the yrast bands of the even - even nuclei only one neutron pair ( 1@xmath88 )",
    "is broken .",
    "consequently these bands are more sensitive to the pair fluctuations .",
    "this argument is consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that in bands with two broken pairs ( odd-@xmath89 nuclei and negative parity bands in even - even nuclei ) the pair fluctuations reduce the angular momentum only by 12 units .",
    "hence , only the low-@xmath3 bands are suited to study the influence of the pair fluctuations on the moments of inertia .",
    "it was seen in sec .",
    "[ results ] that the behavior of the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 bands at low angular velocity is largely determined by a single proton in a @xmath35 orbital .",
    "the behavior was qualitatively explained in terms of a particle - rotor model where all nucleons except the @xmath35 proton are assumed to make a constant contribution to @xmath55 equal to @xmath90 and a contribution to @xmath53 equal to @xmath91 , where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "this situation may be further analyzed by calculating the quantal states of this model .",
    "in particular , we address the question of whether the deviation between the experiment and the calculation in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ h9half ] are related to the violation of angular momentum conservation in the tac model .",
    "a quantal treatment of the system of a particle coupled to a @xmath92 rotor was given previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath35 proton to the deformed core is treated in a schematic way .",
    "the particle space is restricted to a multiplet of angular - momentum eigenstates with quantum number @xmath93 , and @xmath6 , acting on the single proton , is taken to be a quadratic function of @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficient of this quadratic function is chosen so as to reproduce the splitting of the @xmath35 proton level found for the full hamiltonian @xmath6 at the deformations of the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 band heads ( see sec .",
    "[ details ] ) .    the particle - rotor problem can be treated in the semiclassical tac approximation .",
    "the details are described in ref .",
    "the function @xmath54 of the @xmath94 band thus calculated with @xmath61=55  mev@xmath44 is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ h9half ] .",
    "it is seen that the schematic model reproduces the result of the full tac calculation , seen in the upper panel , very closely .",
    "the result of the exact quantal treatment of the same particle - rotor model is also shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ h9half ] . in order to generate the plot the quantal energies are treated like empirical ones ( see secs .  [ tac ] and  [ results ] ) .",
    "the quantal calculation conforms better to the data than the tac approximation in producing a more linear function @xmath54 .",
    "however , extrapolating this function from the empirical range of @xmath51 to @xmath57 yields @xmath95 , which is significantly larger than the empirical value @xmath96 .",
    "the different behaviors of the quantal particle - rotor model and the tac approximation to it arise essentially from replacing the recoil energy @xmath97 by @xmath98  @xcite . while the former is approximately a constant , the latter acts as a potential that hinders the increase of @xmath99 .",
    "contrary to the quantal model , the cranking model was seen to reproduce the extrapolated value of @xmath53 found empirically for the @xmath33 and  @xmath34 bands .",
    "thus , the nuclear system does not seem to absorb the recoil angular momentum of the @xmath35 proton into just a single degree of freedom , as assumed in the quantal particle - rotor model .",
    "the present study does not provide an answer to the interesting question : how can the experimental curve @xmath54 be so strikingly linear while the alignment is far from being complete ?      in the standard principal - axis cranking ( pac )",
    "model , @xmath100 is assumed .",
    "thus , one obtains a function @xmath54 .",
    "a corresponding empirical function is extracted from the data by combining the tac geometry with the assumption @xmath101 for a rotational band with a band head angular - momentum quantum number @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "what makes the essential difference between the pac and tac models is thus the term @xmath102 in the routhian  ( [ sp ] ) of the latter .",
    "this term violates the invariance under rotation by the angle @xmath103 about the 1-axis , whose eigenvalue is the `` signature '' . in the pac model ,",
    "a `` favored '' and an `` unfavored '' function @xmath54 , where the latter is the larger , are associated with a configuration with @xmath104 .",
    "these functions have opposite signature and correspond to two separate level sequences with @xmath105 .",
    "derivatives @xmath106 for the @xmath94 and  @xmath49 bands calculated in both models are compared with the corresponding empirical data in fig .",
    "the derivative is seen to depend much more violently on @xmath51 in the pac model than in the tac model .",
    "furthermore , the pac calculation shows a substantial signature splitting . since neither of these features",
    "is seen in the data , it must be concluded that the term @xmath102 in the routhian  ( [ sp ] ) is significant for the description of these high k - bands .",
    "the difference between the pac and tac results is larger for the @xmath43 than the @xmath94 band .",
    "this is due to the smaller deformation @xmath19 of the former .",
    "it has been shown quantitatively how the moments of inertia in the zero - pairing limit may be substantially lower than the rigid - body value , indicating the presence of mass currents of quantal origin in the body - fixed frame of reference .",
    "lower - than - rigid moments of inertia are both calculated and observed systematically for rotational bands in @xmath1hf , @xmath1w and  @xmath2w , where the neutron and proton fermi levels are in the mid - to - upper portions of their respective shells .",
    "the analysis of a number of high - seniority bands shows that they behave as if the nuclei rotate in the unpaired state .",
    "the limited sensitivity of the calculated multi - quasiparticle rotational motion to pair gaps in the range 050% of their full value suggests that moments of inertia of high-@xmath3 bands may not be significantly affected by dynamic pair correlations .",
