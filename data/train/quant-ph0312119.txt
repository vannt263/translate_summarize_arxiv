    "we identify the amount of state entanglement by examining the relative localization of the wavepackets of the electron and ion , under the simplifying assumptions that the incident photon momentum and the post - breakup coulomb interaction can be neglected .",
    "the different time regimes for entanglement are identified .",
    "due to the finite mass of the particles , the wave function of the system changes drastically between the initial stage and the long - time limit .",
    "we find suitable measures of the entanglement of the electron and ion that are connected with their packet widths in position space , specifically the coincidence width and the single - particle width . in view of other treatments of breakup @xcite ,",
    "these localization measures give an alternative view of entanglement and reveal new channels for achieving high degrees of entanglement .",
    "our choice of measure also identifies entanglement  control parameters \" for comparison with those that have been advanced in previous studies of both photon - atom @xcite and photon - photon @xcite wave functions , and through conditional localization it is related to formal photonic analogues @xcite of the epr discussion and bimolecular breakup as a route to matter wave entanglement @xcite .",

    "thus we see that the time - dependent entanglement parameter @xmath190 starts from a large value @xmath211 , falls to @xmath212 and then grows again to the same value from which it started .",
    "physically such an evolution means that initially one of the wave packets is much wider than the other one , and for this reason the electron - ion entanglement is large .",
    "then , as the narrower wave packet spreads faster , they become approximately of the same width , and this corresponds to a small entanglement .",
    "finally , when the initially narrower but faster spreading wave packet outstrips the initially wider but slower spreading one , the relation between their widths reverses , and this returns us to the case of a large entanglement .",
    "the difference between the cases @xmath207 and @xmath213 concerns only the direction of evolution , correspondingly , to the right or to the left in the @xmath165-axis in fig .",
    "if the initial value of the parameter @xmath165 is located in the small - entanglement region ( [ reg3 ] ) , @xmath214 , all the conclusions about the direction of evolution and about the relation between the initial and final values of the entanglement parameter remain valid .",
    "however , in this case , at all times @xmath92 the entanglement parameter remains on the order of one .",
    "if @xmath196 , the entanglement parameter does not change at all , and @xmath215 .",
    "the discussion as given so far does nt treat some elements that will come into play in experimental tests . in order to bring them into focus briefly ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] what can be called experimentally realistic zones .",
    "we have plotted the region where the relative probability distribution is non - zero .",
    "it has a three - dimensional aspect that we do not need to show because it is axially symmetric about the polarization axis of the ionizing light beam , taken as the vertical axis here .",
    "it is not spherically symmetric because of the dipole character of photoionization ( i.e. , the factor @xmath216 in eq .",
    "( [ psi - residue - int ] ) ) .",
    "the new - moon shaded areas indicate the regions where the relative - motion wave function @xmath217 is relatively large .    since the time evolution of the relative wave function",
    "is strictly limited by the step function @xmath218 , we will here consider the ion position to define an origin of polar coordinates ( @xmath219 ) , in which case a circle of radius @xmath220 limits the range of the electron coordinate at time @xmath92 .",
    "the relative coordinate probability distribution @xmath217 is of course not uniform inside this circle , so we have drawn the boundary on which @xmath94 equals @xmath221 of its maximum value .",
    "this creates two sectors with ",
    "new - moon \" shape where there is the highest probability to find the electron , given that the ion is at the origin of the circle , and taking only @xmath94 into account .",
    "however , the probable position of the electron is also influenced by @xmath222 at @xmath223 . in the figure",
    "the black dot regions show the range of electron positions given by @xmath222 at different positions of the center of mass along the @xmath224-@xmath225 line .",
    "the figure has many variations , and the sizes of the new - moon and @xmath226 zones change in time , as our formulas indicate .",
    "the overall shapes will remain the same , and a generic high - entanglement experiment will be one that ensures overlap between a small black - dot region and a high - probability portion of one of the new - moon regions ( near the circle boundary ) . higher count rate , although reduced entanglement , will be associated with increased size of the black dot region .",
    "it is easy to see that very similar results will arise in a treatment of photodissociation of molecules . here",
    "we remark briefly on some of the differences .",
    "let us assume that we consider a diatomic molecule undergoing dissociation .",
    "there will be a relevant dissociation rate @xmath227 , which can be substituted for the @xmath61 governing ionization , and just as for the atom there will be an initial localization of the molecular center of mass . then the main differences to the ionization example arise because the mass ratio of the fragments is much closer to 1 .",
    "compared to the case of photoionization , where @xmath228 , the masses @xmath229 and @xmath230 of the photodissociation fragments obey @xmath231 .",
    "given this , the relative - motion velocity after dissociation @xmath232 is significantly smaller than in the case of ionization ( in atomic units @xmath233 ) .",
    "the main difference between photoionization and photodissociation results concerns the region @xmath234 of intermediate values of @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where @xmath212 . for @xmath235",
    "this region degenerates into a single point @xmath236 ( [ eta * ] ) .",
    "the entanglement coefficient @xmath183 is large both at @xmath237 and @xmath238 . to show more clearly the difference between photoionization and photodissociation we plot in the right picture of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] both molecular and atomic entanglement coefficients in their dependence on @xmath239 , with the electron to ion mass ration taking a realistic value @xmath240 .",
    "this picture shows that if in the case of photoionization there is a rather large region of intermediate values of @xmath165 where entanglement is small , @xmath241 , in the case of photodissociation of a molecule the entanglement parameter is large practically at any @xmath165 except one point @xmath242 .    in dependence on time",
    "@xmath92 the control parameter @xmath123 changes in a way similar to that described above for photoionization : @xmath123 grows if initially it is small ( @xmath198 ) and falls if large ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the final value of the control parameter @xmath243 is related to @xmath206 by eq .",
    "( [ eta - asympt ] ) , which takes the form @xmath244 .",
    "as shown previously , the initial and final values of the time - dependent entanglement parameter @xmath190 are equal to each other , @xmath245 . at @xmath196 both the control",
    "parameter @xmath123 and the entanglement parameter @xmath190 do not change with a varying time @xmath92 , @xmath246 and @xmath215 .",
    "this is the only case when there is no entanglement at any time @xmath92 . in all other cases ( @xmath247 )",
    "the entanglement parameter is large initially , reaches @xmath248 one at such @xmath92 that gives @xmath249 , and then grows again until it reaches its initial value @xmath211 .",
    "we have evaluated the space - time behavior of the joint quantum state of an ion and electron following photoionization .",
    "neglect of the incident photon momentum and of the final state coulomb interaction means that the evolution of the state , and thus of the entanglement between the two particles , is constrained only by free - particle two - body momentum and energy conservation .",
    "this evolution provides an exactly calculable illustration of the situation involving massive particles sketched in the famous paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen  @xcite .",
    "we have obtained expressions for the entanglement - induced wave packet narrowing that occurs , and have indicated how entanglement can be identified and determined quantitatively . to do this we introduced @xmath183 , the ratio between the entanglement - free wave packet width and the coincidence wave packet width .",
    "this is essentially the degree of entanglement .",
    "we gave expressions for @xmath183 in terms of ionization rate and packet spreading velocity , which are of course themselves determined by underlying parameters such as atomic bound - free dipole moments , relative electron and ion masses , ionizing field strength , etc .",
    "it was shown that @xmath183 depends in a simple way on the basic control parameter @xmath250 , and can be much larger than unity in two limits , when @xmath180 and also @xmath181 .",
    "the same formalism can be applied equally well to photodissociation of a diatomic molecule . for realistic physical values of the relevant parameters , in a typical example of atomic photoionization",
