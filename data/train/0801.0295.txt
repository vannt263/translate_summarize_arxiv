    "a knowledge of electric dipole polarizabilities is necessary in many areas of physics and chemistry . in particular it is required in studies of collisions involving atoms and molecules @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the pre - eminent role of polarizabilities in the determination of inter atomic interactions has assumed special significance in the context of research on ultra - cold atoms @xcite .",
    "calculations of atomic polarizabilities have come a long way since the classic work of dalgarno and lewis @xcite . following a series of calculations using the coupled hartree - fock method ( see for example , @xcite ) , a number of state - of - the art methods including the coupled - cluster ( cc ) theory have been used to calculate atomic and molecular polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "a few calculations of the polarizabilities of heavy atomic systems have been performed in the past few years using the linearized @xcite as well as the non - linearized @xcite relativistic cc theory .",
    "these are based on approaches that sum over a set of intermediate states .",
    "in contrast , we have obtained the first order perturbed wavefunction by solving the first order perturbed cc equation and used it to obtain the dipole polarizabilities of the closed - shell alkaline earth atoms and ytterbium ( yb ) .",
    "information on these quantities is useful for the frequency standards experiments that have been proposed for mg @xcite , ca @xcite , sr @xcite and yb @xcite as well as the search for the electric dipole moment in yb @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable interest in accurate calculations of the dipole polarizabilities of alkaline earth atoms and yb .",
    "sadlej et al have calculated these quantities for ca , sr and ba using a quasi relativistic approach but their treatment of correlation is rigorous @xcite .",
    "their calculations have been carried out at the finite order many - body perturbation theory and cc levels .",
    "porsev and derevianko have performed calculations of the dipole polarizabilities of mg , ca , sr and yb by a hybrid approach involving many - body perturbation theory and the configuration interaction method @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the dipole polarizability of yb based on the time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "in a dc electric field @xmath0 , the energy shift @xmath1 of the ground state @xmath2 with the parity eigenvalue @xmath3 and angular momentum @xmath4 and its azimuthal value @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the static polarizability and can be defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10th component of the electric dipole operator depending upon the applied field @xmath11 , subscript @xmath12 denotes the intermediate states and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are their angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath3 and @xmath15 are parity quantum numbers for states of opposite parity and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy values of the ground state and the corresponding intermediate states @xmath12 , respectively .    in a more explicit form",
    ", the above expression can be written as    @xmath18    where we define @xmath19 as the first order correction to the original unperturbed wavefunction @xmath20 due to the operator @xmath9 and hence the total wavefunction in the presence of an external dc electric field is given by @xmath21    our aim in this work is to obtain the exact wavefunction @xmath22 by calculating both @xmath23 and @xmath24 wavefunctions using an approach which can rigorously incorporate the relativistic and correlation effects .",
    "in other words , we would like to obtain @xmath25 for the dirac - coulomb ( dc ) wavefunction @xmath23 as the solution of the following equation    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the dc hamiltonian and interaction due to @xmath9 , respectively .    using the cc ansatz , we express wavefunctions @xmath22 by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the dirac - fock ( df ) wavefunctions determined using the mean - field approximation and @xmath31 are the electron excitation operators from the corresponding df states .    to obtain both the unperturbed and perturbed wavefunctions of eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) separately , we divide the excitation operators @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the all order excitation operator of the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method and its first order correction arising in the presence of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 represents the perturbation parameter .",
    "more explicitly , we can write the unperturbed and perturbed wavefunctions in terms of the rcc excitation operators as @xmath36 where the exponential function of @xmath34 reduces to the linear term since we have considered only one order of @xmath9 operator in eq . ( 2.5 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we have considered all possible single and double excitations ( ccsd approach ) in the calculations .",
    "we obtain first the unperturbed @xmath33 amplitudes by solving the usual ( r)cc equations , then these amplitudes are used to determine the @xmath34 amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding equations to solve these amplitudes are given by @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath38 represents normal order form of the operators and we have defined @xmath39 , with the subscript @xmath40 representing connected terms .    the polarizabilities are determined by evaluating the following expression @xmath41 where for computational simplicity we define @xmath42 .",
    "we compute these terms after expressing them as effective one - body and two - body terms using the generalized wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "in table [ tab1 ] , we present our results of electric dipole polarizabilities and compare with those available in the literature .",
    "the error bars in the experimental results are large for all the systems and our results lie within them .",
    "the results of the calculations that are given in the above table are obtained using a variety of many - body theories .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with them except for a few cases where they differ by more than 5% .",
    "mitroy and bromley @xcite have used oscillator strengths from a semiempirical approach to obtain these quantities .",
    "some results based on an _ ab initio _ method that combines the configuration interaction ( ci ) method and many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) are available @xcite . in these calculations , the valence electrons correlation effects are evaluated by the ci method whereas the core electrons correlation effects are calculated using the mbpt method .",
    "however , these calculations consider the core - polarization effects in the framework of finite order mbpt , while our cc method takes them into account to all orders .",
