    "magnetic fields may regulate the ` disc accretion phase ' of star formation by providing means of transporting away the excess angular momentum of the disc , enabling matter to accrete .",
    "the more generally relevant mechanisms associated with this are mhd turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) and outflows driven centrifugally from the disc surfaces ( blandford & payne 1982 , wardle & knigl 1993 ; see also the review by knigl & pudritz 2000 ) .",
    "these processes are , in turn , thought to play key roles in the dynamics and evolution of astrophysical accretion discs .",
    "magnetically driven turbulence is likely to impact disc chemistry ( e.g. semenov , wiebe & henning 2006 , ilgner & nelson 2006 ) as well as the properties  and evolution  of dust grains mixed with the gas ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "magnetic resonances have been shown to modify the net tidal torque exerted by the disc on a forming planet and thus , alter the speed and direction of the planet s migration through the disc ( terquem 2003 ; johnson , goodman & menou 2006 ) .",
    "finally , the magnetically inactive ( dead ) zones ( gammie 1996 ; wardle 1997 ) are not only the regions where planets are thought to form , but they have also been invoked as a possible mechanism to stop their inward migration ( e.g. matsumura & pudritz 2005 ) .    in protoplanetary discs , however , the magnetic diffusivity can be high enough to limit  or even suppress  these processes .",
    "the specific role magnetic fields are able to play in these environments is , therefore , largely determined by the degree of coupling between the field and the neutral gas .",
    "a critical parameter for this analysis is the ionisation fraction of the fluid , which reflects the equilibrium between ionisation and recombination processes taking place in the disc .",
    "ionisation processes outside the disc innermost sections ( @xmath20 au ) are non - thermal , driven by interstellar cosmic rays , x - rays emitted by the magnetically active protostar and radioactive decay ( hayashi 1981 ; glassgold , najita & igea 1997 ; igea & glassgold 1999 ; fromang , terquem & balbus 2002 ) . on the other hand , free electrons are lost through recombination processes which , in general , take place both in the gas phase and on grain surfaces ( e.g. nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 ) .",
    "dust grains affect the level of magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs when they are well mixed with the gas ( e.g. in relatively early stages of accretion and/or when turbulence prevents them from settling towards the midplane ) .",
    "they do so in two ways .",
    "first , they reduce the ionisation fraction by providing additional pathways for electrons and ions to recombine on their surfaces .",
    "second , charged dust particles can become important species in high density regions ( umebayashi & nakano 1990 ; nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath1 au in a disc where @xmath17 m grains are present , positively charged particles are the most abundant ionised species within two scaleheights from the midplane ( see fig",
    ".  6 of wardle 2007 ; hereafter w07 ) .",
    "as these particles generally have large cross sections , collisions with the neutrals are important and they become decoupled ( or partially decoupled ) to the magnetic field at densities for which smaller species , typically ions and electrons , would still be well tied to it .    both of these mechanisms act to lower the conductivity of the fluid , especially near the midplane where the density is high and ionisation processes are inefficient . in the minimum - mass solar nebula disc ( hayashi 1981 , hayashi et el . 1985 ) , for example , x - rays are completely attenuated below @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath1 of salmeron & wardle 2005 ; hereafter sw05 ) . as a result , in the disc inner sections the magnetic coupling may be insufficient to provide adequate link between the neutral particles and the field .",
    "moreover , recent calculations for a minimum - mass solar nebula disk exposed to x - ray and cosmic ray ionising fluxes ( w07 ) indicate that near the surface ( above 3 - 4 tidal scaleheights ) the magnetic diffusivity can also be severe , even though in these regions the ionising flux is strongest and the electron fraction is significantly larger than it is in the disc interior .",
    "this effect results from the strong decline in the number density of charged particles high above the midplane .",
    "these considerations suggest that magnetic activity in the inner regions of weakly ionised discs may well be confined to intermediate heights above the midplane ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is clear that the level of magnetic diffusion is strongly dependent on the presence , and size distribution , of dust particles suspended in the gas phase .",
    "in fact , once dust grains have settled , the ionisation fraction may be enough to produce adequate magnetic coupling over the entire vertical extension of the disk even at @xmath23 au ( w07 ) . a realistic study of the properties of the mri in these discs",
    "must , therefore , incorporate a consistent treatment of dust dynamics and evolution ( unless they are assumed to have settled , a good approximation to model relatively late accretion stages , as was the case in sw03 and sw05 ) .",
    "this analysis is further complicated because dust grains have complex spatial and size distributions ( e.g. mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 , umebayashi & nakano 1990 , dalessio et al .",
    "2006 ) , determined by the competing action of processes involving sticking , shattering , coagulation , growth ( and/or sublimation ) of ice mantles and settling to the midplane ( e.g. weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) . previous results ( sw03 , sw05 ) highlight also the importance of incorporating in these studies all three diffusion mechanisms between the magnetic field and the neutral fluid ( namely , the ohmic , hall and ambipolar diffusivities ) , as hall diffusion largely determines the growth and structure of mri perturbations , particularly in the disc inner regions ( e.g. within distances of the order of a few au from the central protostar ; sw05 ) .",
    "this is implemented here via a diffusivity tensor formalism ( cowling 1957 , norman & heyvaertz 1985 , nakano & umebayashi 1986 , wardle & ng 1999 , w07 ) .",
    "dust grains can affect the structure and dynamics of accretion discs via two additional mechanisms : dust opacity can modify the radiative transfer within the disc  which , in turn , can dramatically alter its structure  and dust particles may become dynamically important if their abundance is sufficiently high . in this study",
    "both effects are small because the disc is vertically isothermal and grains constitute only a small fraction of the mass of the gas ( see below ) .",
    "in this paper we study the vertical structure and linear growth of the mri in a disc where dust grains are well mixed with the gas over its entire vertical dimension .",
    "results are presented for two representative distances ( @xmath3 and @xmath24 au ) from the central protostar . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that all particles have the same radius ",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath15 m  and constitute @xmath1% of the total mass of the gas , a typical assumption in studies of molecular clouds ( umebayashi & nakano 1990 ) .",
    "this fraction is constant with height , which means that we have also assumed that no sedimentation has occurred .",
    "although this is a very simplified picture , the results illustrate the importance of dust particles in the delicate ionisation equilibrium of discs , and consequently , on their magnetic activity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the adopted disc model is described in section [ sec4:cond ] .",
    "section [ sec4:formulation ] briefly summarises the formulation and methodology , which are based on sw05 .",
    "we refer the reader to that study  and references therein  for further details .",
    "this section also includes a discussion of the typical dependence of the components of the diffusivity tensor and magnetic coupling with height with ( and without ) grains for the two radial positions of interest .",
    "section [ sec4:mri ] then presents the vertical structure and linear growth of unstable mri modes at these radii and compares solutions incorporating different diffusion mechanisms and assumptions regarding the presence , and size , of dust grains .",
    "these results , and possible implications for the dynamics and evolution of low conductivity discs , are discussed in section [ sec4:discussion ] .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our fiducial disc , assumed to be geometrically thin and vertically isothermal , is based on the minimum - mass solar nebula model ( hayashi 1981 , hayashi et al 1985 ) .",
    "our formulation incorporates the disc vertical stratification but  following common practice ",
    "it neglects radial gradients .",
    "this is appropriate , as these gradients typically occur over a much larger length scale than those in the vertical direction . under these assumptions ,",
    "the equilibrium structure of the disc is the result of the balance between the vertical component of the gravitational force exerted by the central object and the pressure gradient within the disc .",
    "the vertical profile of the density is then given by    @xmath25 \\ , ,      \\label{eq : rhoinitial}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the midplane density and @xmath27 is the tidal scaleheight of the gas .",
    "the neutral gas is assumed to be composed of molecular hydrogen and helium , such that @xmath28 , which results in @xmath29 .    as already mentioned above",
    ", a key feature of protoplanetary accretion discs is that they are weakly ionised .",
    "this is because ionisation processes are generally ineffective ( except possibly in the vicinity of the star and in the surface regions ) , while the recombination rate is accelerated by the high density of the fluid and the removal of charges by dust grains ( if present ) .",
    "in fact , outside the innermost @xmath30 - @xmath31 au , where thermal effects are relevant ( e.g. hayashi 1981 ) , the main ionising sources are x - rays and uv radiation emanating from the central object ( e.g. glassgold , feigelson & montmerle 2000 ) and  to a much lesser extent  the decay of radioactive materials , particularly @xmath32 ( consolmagno & jokipii 1978 , sano et al .",
    "interstellar cosmic rays may also be important as they can potentially reach deeper into the disc than x - ray and uv fluxes do .",
    "in fact , cosmic rays are the dominant ionising source at 1 au for @xmath33 ( they even reach the midplane at this radius , albeit significantly attenuated ; e.g. sw05 ) .",
    "however , their actual contribution is unclear because the low - energy particles responsible for ionisation may be scattered by outflows launched from the protostar - disc system ( e.g. fromang et al . 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "recombination processes in the disc generally occur both in the gas phase ( through the dissociative recombination of electrons with molecular ions and the radiative recombination with metal ions ) and on grain surfaces ( e.g. oppenheimer & dalgarno 1974 , spitzer 1978 , umebayashi & nakano 1980 , nishi et al .",
    "1991 , sano et al .",
    "2000 ) . for a typical abundance of metal atoms in the gas phase of @xmath34 is the fraction of heavy metal atoms in the gas phase , estimated from interstellar absorption lines in diffuse clouds ( morton 1974 ) . ]",
    "( umebayashi & nakano 1990 ) , the radiative recombination rate of metal ions is dominant for all vertical locations of interest , with the exception of the uppermost sections of the disc ( see fig .  2 of sw05 ) .",
    "the resulting ionisation fraction of the fluid largely determines the ability of the magnetic field to couple to the gas and shear and thus , regulates the magnetic activity in these astrophysical systems . in protoplanetary discs , in particular ,",
    "the field has been envisioned to be dynamically important near the surface , whereas magnetic activity may be suppressed in their inner sections ( the ` layered accretion ' scenario ; gammie 1996 , wardle 1997 ) .",
    "however , the existence and configuration of a magnetically inactive  dead  zone in the disk interior has been shown to be critically dependent on the presence and properties of dust grains mixed with the gas ( w07 ) .",
    "as this study shows , in a minimum - mass solar nebula model at 1 au the entire cross section of the disc is magnetically coupled when dust grains are assumed to have settled to the midplane .",
    "it is , in particular , the presence of small grains what most severely affects the magnetic coupling .",
    "for example , the presence of a standard interstellar population of @xmath17 m grains at 1 au reduces the total active layer of the disc from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this column density increases to @xmath37 once the grains aggregate to @xmath15 m . at",
    "5 au , in contrast , the entire cross section of the disc is coupled once the grains have grown to @xmath19 m ( we refer the reader to w07 for further details of these models ) .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper are based on the formulation detailed in sw03 and sw05 .",
    "only a brief summary is given here .",
    "we write the equations of non - ideal mhd about a local keplerian frame that corotates with the disc at the keplerian frequency @xmath38 and express the velocity field as a departure from exact keplerian motion .",
    "we further assume that the abundances of charged species are sufficiently low to be able to neglect their inertia , thermal pressure and the effect of ionisation and recombination processes on the neutrals . under these conditions ,",
    "only the equations of motion for the neutral gas are required :    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    in the equation of motion ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , @xmath42 is the gravitational potential for a non self - gravitating disc and @xmath43 is the centripetal term generated by keplerian motion .",
    "coriolis terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 are associated with the use of a local keplerian frame and @xmath46 is the isothermal sound speed . in the induction equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) , @xmath47 is the electric field in the frame comoving with the neutrals and @xmath48 accounts for the generation of toroidal field by the disc differential rotation .",
    "finally , the magnetic field must also satisfy the constraint @xmath49 and the current density must satisfy ampere s law ,    @xmath50    and ohm s law    @xmath51    following wardle & ng ( 1999 ) and wardle ( 1999 ; hereafter w99 ) , the current density is expressed as ,    @xmath52    where subscripts @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote vector components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath55 . in this expression ,",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the ohmic , hall and pedersen conductivity terms given by ,    @xmath59    @xmath60    and    @xmath61    subscript @xmath62 is used here to label the charged species .",
    "they are characterised by their number density @xmath63 , particle mass @xmath64 , charge @xmath65 and hall parameter    @xmath66    ( the ratio of the gyrofrequency and the collision frequency with the neutrals ) , which measures the relative importance of the lorentz and drag forces in balancing the electric force on the particle .    equation ( [ eq : j - e ] ) can be inverted to find an expression for @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the following form of the induction equation ( w07 )    @xmath67   \\ , ,      \\label{eq1:induction_drift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath68    @xmath69    and    @xmath70    are the ohmic , hall and ambipolar diffusivities ; and    @xmath71    is the total conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field . when ions and electrons are the only charged species , it can be shown that ( w07 )    @xmath72    and    @xmath73    note that the ohmic ( @xmath74 ) and ambipolar ( @xmath75 ) diffusivity terms are always positive , as the former does not depend on the magnetic field strength and the second scale quadratically with it . as a result , they are both invariant under a reversal of the magnetic field polarity . on the contrary , the hall term ( @xmath76 ) scales linearly with @xmath11 and thus , can become negative . the change in sign of @xmath76 corresponds , in turn , to a change in the direction of the magnetic field at the height where particular species become decoupled to it by collisions with the neutrals .",
    "it corresponds , therefore , to changes in the contribution of different charged species to this component of the diffusivity tensor .",
    "the relative importance of the diffusion terms in ( [ eq : etao ] ) to ( [ eq : etaa ] ) differentiate three _",
    "diffusivity regimes _ :",
    "1 .   in the _ ambipolar diffusion _",
    "regime , @xmath77 for most charged species and @xmath78 . in this limit , which is typically dominant in low density regions ( e.g. in molecular clouds and near the surface of protoplanetary discs ) , the magnetic field is effectively frozen into the ionized component of the fluid and drifts with it through the neutrals .",
    "2 .   _ ohmic ( resistive ) _ limit . in this case @xmath79 for most charged species , resulting in @xmath80 .",
    "the magnetic field can not be regarded as being frozen into any fluid component and the diffusivity is a scalar , the well - known ohmic diffusivity .",
    "this regime dominates close to the midplane in the inner regions ( @xmath81 au ) of protoplanetary discs when the magnetic field is relatively weak ( w07 ) .",
    "_ hall diffusion _ limit , which occurs when @xmath77 for charged species of one sign ( typically electrons ) and @xmath82 for those of the other sign ( e.g.  ions ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath83 and @xmath74 . this regime is important at intermediate densities ( between those at which ambipolar and ohmic diffusion regimes dominate ) .",
    "it has been shown to prevail under fluid conditions satisfied over vast regions in protoplanetary discs ( e.g. sano & stone 2002a , w07 ) .",
    "the diffusivities used in this study were calculated using the procedure described in w07 , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "essentially , the adopted chemical reaction scheme is based on that of nishi , nakano & umebayashi ( 1991 ) , but it allows for higher charge states on dust grains .",
    "this is necessary because of the higher temperature and density of protoplanetary discs in relation to those typically associated with molecular clouds .    finally , in the following sections we will also use the magnetic coupling parameter ( w99 )    @xmath84    the ratio of the critical frequency ( @xmath85 ) _ above _ which flux - freezing conditions break down and the dynamical ( keplerian ) frequency of the disc . for the sake of clarity we now sketch the arguments leading to this expression ( see also wardle & ng 1999 ) .",
    "first , recall that non - ideal mhd effects become important when the inductive and diffusive terms in the induction equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) are comparable ; or    @xmath86    where ( see equation [ eq1:ohm ] )    @xmath87    in expression ( [ eq : ohm10 ] ) , @xmath88 is taken to be a characteristic measure of the conductivity of the gas .",
    "next , we adopt the following typical values for the various terms above    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the wavenumber of the mri perturbations in flux - freezing conditions and @xmath91 is the local alfvn speed .",
    "substituting these relations in ( [ eq : ind1 ] ) yields the desired expression for @xmath85 .",
    "this parameter is useful because in ideal - mhd conditions , the instability grows at @xmath92 ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . consequently",
    ", if @xmath93 ( or @xmath94 ) the field is poorly coupled to the disc at the frequencies of interest for the analysis of the mri and non - ideal mhd effects are expected to be important .",
    "equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) to ( [ eq1:j_curlb ] ) and ( [ eq : j - e ] ) are linearized about an initial ( labeled by a subscript ` 0 ' ) , steady state where the magnetic field is vertical and the current density , fluid velocity and electric field in the frame comoving with the neutrals all vanish . as a result of the last condition , the changes in the components of the diffusivity tensor are not relevant in this linear formulation ( e.g. @xmath95 ) and only the initial , unperturbed values are required .",
    "taking perturbations of the form @xmath96 and assuming @xmath97 we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) in @xmath98 ( the perturbations of the electric field in the laboratory frame ) , @xmath99 , and the perturbations growth rate @xmath100 .",
    "three parameters are found to control the dynamics and evolution of the fluid : ( @xmath1 ) @xmath101 , the local ratio of the alfvn speed and the isothermal sound speed of the gas , which measures the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "( @xmath102 ) @xmath103 , the coupling between the ionised and neutral components of the fluid .",
    "( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 , the ratio of the diffusivity terms perpendicular to @xmath55 , which characterises the diffusivity regime of the fluid .",
    "these parameters are evaluated at different locations ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) of the disc taking the magnetic field strength ( @xmath108 mg ) as a free parameter .",
    "the system of equations is integrated vertically as a two - point boundary value problem for coupled ode with boundary conditions @xmath109 and @xmath110 at @xmath111 and @xmath109 at @xmath112 .    given that magnetic diffusion can have such a dramatic effect on the properties of magnetically - driven turbulence in protoplanetary discs , we now present calculations of the magnetic diffusivity at 5 and 10 au .",
    "we explore which disc regions are expected to be magnetically coupled and which diffusion mechanism is dominant at different positions ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) as a function of @xmath11 . this discussion is relevant for the analysis of our mri results at these locations ( section [ sec4:mri ] ) .      fig .",
    "[ fig:10au_eta_1 ] shows the components of the diffusivity tensor ( @xmath74 , @xmath113 and @xmath75 ) as a function of height for @xmath114 au and a representative field strength ( @xmath115 mg ) .",
    "the solutions in the top panel have been obtained assuming that dust grains have settled into a thin layer about the midplane , so the charges are carried by ions and electrons only .",
    "the results in the middle and bottom panels incorporate a population of 1 and 0.1 @xmath116m - sized grains , respectively .",
    "note that when dust grains are present , all diffusivity terms increase drastically in relation to their values in the no - grains scenario .",
    "this effect becomes more accentuated as the grain size diminishes , given the efficiency of small grains in removing free electrons from the gas .",
    "for example , in the case that incorporates @xmath17m - sized particles ( bottom panel ) , the diffusivity components at the midplane are larger , by 4  7 orders of magnitude , than their corresponding values when the grains have settled .",

    "note that the hall diffusivity term increases less sharply than the ambipolar diffusivity in response to the fall in fluid density .",

    ", @xmath75 is typically several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath113 near the surface regions of the disc . finally , for the @xmath17m - sized grain population ( bottom panel ) , @xmath123 for all @xmath107 .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that hall diffusion is suppressed here because of the nearly equal abundances of ( negatively charged ) grains and ions in this region .",
    "note also that the hall diffusivity component shows characteristic ` spikes ' , at the heights where it changes sign .",

    "the density is sufficiently high for electrons to be able to stick to the grains . as a result",
    ", they reside mainly on dust particles , as do about a third of the ions .",
    "the contribution of ( negatively charged ) grains and ions to the hall diffusivity term are very similar , with a small positive excess , which determines the sign of @xmath76 in this region . on the contrary , at @xmath128 ,",
    "ions are the dominant positively charged species , while the negative charges are still contained in dust grains and drift together with the neutrals .",
    "consequently , @xmath76 is negative in this section of the disc . at @xmath130 ,",
    "ions and electrons are the main charge carriers and ions dominate the contribution to the hall term , which makes @xmath76 positive .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to increases ( decreases ) in @xmath144 by factors of 10 in the direction of a stronger ( weaker ) magnetic field",
    ".    note that at 10 au , in the no - grains case ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : contour_10au ] ) , field strengths @xmath145 a few gauss are able to couple to the gas at the midplane .",
    "hall diffusion dominates at this location for @xmath146 g but the range of field strengths over which this occurs decreases gradually with height , so that when @xmath147 ambipolar diffusion is dominant for all @xmath11 .",

    "when the particles have aggregated to 1 @xmath116 m in size ( middle panel of fig .",

    "hall diffusion is inhibited close to the midplane for this range of field strengths because the number density of positively and negatively charged grains are very similar .",
    "note , finally , that ohmic diffusion is not dominant in any of the depicted scenarios at this radius , as expected , given the relatively low density of the fluid .",
    "the results at 5 au are qualitatively similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour_5au ] ) to the ones just discussed . one key difference , however , is that ohmic diffusion dominates in all cases for @xmath153 provided that the field is sufficiently weak ( @xmath154 a few milligauss ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion , on the other hand , is dominant for relatively strong fields ( e.g. @xmath155 g at @xmath156 in the no - grains case ) as well as for all @xmath11 near the disk surface ( @xmath157 ) .",

    "furthermore , the presence of this material at radial locations where the temperature is too low to produce them , suggests significant radial mixing takes place as well ( e.g. van dishoeck 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "finally , simulations of dust dynamics and evolution also suggest that in quiescent environments , the grains tend to settle and agglomerate into bigger particles ( e.g. weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) and efficiently coagulate and grow icy mantles ( ossenkopf 1993 ) .",
    "all these processes modify the surface area of dust grains and impact the recombination rate on their surfaces and the way they drift in response to magnetic stresses .",
    "it is also expected that a residual population of small grains would remain ( e.g. nomura et al .",
    "2006 ) even when the mean grain size maybe relatively large ( @xmath224 m ) .",
    "this is an important consideration because these small grains tend to carry a significant fraction of the grain charge ( s07 ) .",
    "the effect of this settling in the spectral energy distribution ( and optical appearance ) of protostellar discs has been investigated in recent studies ( e.g. dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "how quickly , and to what height , dust particles are able to settle is an important , and largely unanswered , question . according to nakagawa , nakazawa & hayashi ( 1981 ) , the mass fraction of @xmath151 - @xmath225 m grains well mixed with the gas , diminishes from @xmath226 to @xmath227 in a timescale of about @xmath228 to @xmath229 years .",
    "moreover , although the timescale for dust grains to sediment all the way to the midplane may exceed the lifetime of the disc , they may be able to settle within a few scaleheights from the midplane in a shorter timescale ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "this is complicated even more by the expectation that the transition between sections were dust grains are well mixed with the gas , and those completely depleted of them , occurs gradually ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "mhd turbulence may itself be an important factor for the settling of dust particles .",
    "it may , in particular , produce sufficient vertical stirring to prevent settling below a certain height ( dullemond & dominik 2004 , carballido et al . 2005 , turner et al . 2006 ) . however , this is contingent on the disc being able to generate and sustain mhd turbulence in the vertical sections where the dust is present .",
    "this is not guaranteed , even if turbulence exists in other regions , as dust grains efficiently reduce the ionisation fraction ( and magnetic coupling ) of the gas . as a result , the efficiency  and even the viability  of mhd turbulence in the presence of dust grains , is an important topic that merits careful investigation .",
    "we have explored in this paper the linear growth and vertical structure of mri unstable modes at two representative radii ( @xmath3 and 10 au ) in protoplanetary discs .",

    "these solutions are compared with those arrived at assuming that the grains have settled to the midplane of the disc ( sw05 ) .",
    "we have also explored which disc sections are expected to be magnetically coupled and the dominant diffusion mechanism as a function of height and the strength of the magnetic field , which is initially vertical .",
    "our models use a minimum - mass solar nebula disc ( hayashi 1981 , hayashi et al .",
    "1985 ) and incorporate all three diffusion mechanisms between the magnetic field and the neutral gas : ohmic , hall and ambipolar .",
    "the diffusivity components are a function of height ( as is the density ) and are obtained using the method described in w07 , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "essentially , this formalism uses a chemical reaction scheme similar to that of nishi , nakano & umebayashi ( 1991 ) , but it incorporates higher dust - grain charge states that are likely to occur in discs on account of their larger gas density and temperature in relation to those of molecular clouds .",
    "our calculations also include a realistic ionisation profile , with the main ionising sources being cosmic rays , x - rays and ( to a lesser extent ) radioactive decay .",

    "<S> we investigate the linear growth and vertical structure of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in weakly ionised , stratified protoplanetary discs . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is initially vertical and dust grains are assumed to be well mixed with the gas over the entire vertical dimension of the disc . for simplicity , all the grains are assumed to have the same radius ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 m ) and constitute a constant fraction ( 1 % ) of the total mass of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> solutions are obtained at representative radial locations ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 au ) from the central protostar for a minimum - mass solar nebula model and different choices of the initial magnetic field strength , configuration of the diffusivity tensor and grain sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that when no grain are present , or they are @xmath5 m in radius , the midplane of the disc remains magnetically coupled for field strengths up to a few gauss at both radii . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when a population of small grains ( @xmath6 m ) is mixed with the gas , the section of the disc within two tidal scaleheights from the midplane is magnetically inactive and only magnetic fields weaker than @xmath7 mg can effectively couple to the fluid . at 5 </S>",
    "<S> au , ohmic diffusion dominates for @xmath8 when the field is relatively weak ( @xmath9 a few milligauss ) , irrespective of the properties of the grain population . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , at 10 au this diffusion term is unimportant in all the scenarios studied here . high above the midplane ( @xmath10 ) , </S>",
    "<S> ambipolar diffusion is severe and prevents the field from coupling to the gas for all @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> hall diffusion is dominant for a wide range of field strengths at both radii when dust grains are present .    </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate , wavenumber and range of magnetic field strengths for which mri - unstable modes exist are all drastically diminished when dust grains are present , particularly when they are small ( @xmath12 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , mri perturbations grow at @xmath13 au ( 10 au ) for @xmath14 mg ( 130 mg ) when @xmath15 m grains are mixed with the gas . </S>",
    "<S> this upper limit on the field strength is reduced to only @xmath16 mg ( 10 mg ) when the grain size is reduced to @xmath17 m . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the grains are assumed to have settled , mri unstable modes are found for @xmath18 mg at 5 au and 250 mg at 10 au ( salmeron & wardle 2005 ) . </S>",
