    "the vaidya metric @xcite @xmath0 dv^2 + 2\\epsilon \\,dv dr + r^2 d \\omega^2,\\ ] ] is a nonstatic spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations generated by a null stream of radiation . depending on @xmath1 it corresponds to an ingoing ( outgoing ) radial flow and @xmath2 is a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) function in the advanced ( retarded ) time coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "both the vaidya solution and its extension to the charged case , the bonnor - vaidya solution @xcite , have been widely employed in a variety of physical situations , including the spherically symmetric collapse and the formation of singularities @xcite , the study of hawking radiation and black hole evaporation @xcite , the gravitational collapse of charged fluids ( plasma ) @xcite or as a testing tool for various formulations of the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "in addition to this , several theorems on the existence of exact spherically symmetric dynamical black hole solutions have been established @xcite . in the context of modified gravity , vaidya - type solutions have been found in metric @xmath4 gravity coupled to both maxwell and non - abelian yang - mills fields @xcite and in lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "the vaidya metric has also been used to consider whether a wormhole could be generated out of null fluids .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite a crossflow of a two - component radiation was considered , and the resulting solution was interpreted as a wormhole ( this analysis extended the results presented in @xcite ) .",
    "it was indeed shown that a black hole could be converted into a wormhole by irradiating the black - hole horizon with pure phantom radiation , which may cause a black hole with two horizons to merge and consequently form a wormhole .",
    "conversely , switching off the radiation causes the wormhole to collapse to a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "these results were further extended in @xcite showing that two opposite streams of radiation may support a static traversable wormhole .",
    "furthermore , analytic solutions describing wormhole enlargement were presented , where the amount of enlargement was shown to be controlled by the beaming in and the timing of negative - energy and positive - energy impulses .",
    "it was also argued that the wormhole enlargement is not a runaway inflation , but an apparently stable process .",
    "the latter issue addressed the important point that though wormholes were possible , and even expected at the planck scale , macroscopic wormholes were unlikely .",
    "in fact , the generation / construction of wormholes has also been extensively explored in the literature , in different contexts .",
    "the late - time cosmic accelerated expansion implies that its large - scale evolution involves a mysterious cosmological dark energy , which may possibly lie in the phantom regime , i.e. , the dark energy parameter satisfies @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "now , phantom energy violates the null energy condition , and as this is the fundamental ingredient to sustain traversable wormholes @xcite , this cosmic fluid presents us with a natural scenario for the existence of these exotic geometries @xcite . indeed , due to the fact of the accelerating universe , one may argue that macroscopic wormholes could naturally be grown from the submicroscopic constructions , which envisage transient wormholes at the planck scale that originally pervaded the quantum foam @xcite , much in the spirit of the inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that self - inflating wormholes were also discovered numerically @xcite . in the context of dark energy , and in a rather speculative scenario ,",
    "one may also consider the existence of compact time - dependent dark energy stars / spheres @xcite , with an evolving dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide @xcite .",
    "once in the phantom regime , the null energy condition is violated , which physically implies that the negative radial pressure exceeds the energy density .",
    "therefore , an enormous negative pressure in the center may , in principle , imply a topology change , consequently opening up a tunnel and converting the dark energy star into a wormhole .",
    "the criteria for this topology change were also discussed , in particular , a casimir energy approach involving quasi - local energy difference calculations that may reflect or measure the occurrence of a topology change .",
    "as the planck scale plays a fundamental importance in quantum gravitational physics , an outstanding question is whether large metric fluctuations may induce a change in topology .",
    "wheeler suggested that at distances below the planck length , the metric fluctuations become highly nonlinear and strongly interacting , and thus endow space - time with a foamlike structure @xcite .",
    "this behaviour implies that the geometry , and the topology , may be constantly fluctuating , and thus space - time may take on all manners of nontrivial topological structures , such as wormholes .",
    "however , paging through the literature , one does encounter a certain amount of criticism to wheeler s notion of space - time foam , for instance , in that stability considerations may place constraints on the nature or even existence of planck - scale foamlike structures @xcite .",
    "indeed , the change in topology of spacelike sections is an extremely problematic issue , and a number of interesting theorems may be found in the literature on the classical evolution of general relativistic space - times @xcite , namely , citing visser @xcite : ( i ) in causally well - behaved classical space - times the topology of space does not change as a function of time ; ( ii ) in causally ill - behaved classical space - times the topology of space can sometimes change .",
    "nevertheless , researchers in quantum gravity have come to accept the notion of space - time foam , in that this picture leads to topology - changing quantum amplitudes and to interference effects between different space - time topologies @xcite , although these possibilities have met with some disagreement @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that topology - changing processes , such as the creation of wormholes and baby universes , are tightly constrained @xcite , this still allows very interesting geometrical ( rather than topological ) effects , such as the shrinking of certain regions of space - time to umbilical cords of sufficiently small sizes to effectively mimic a change in topology .",
    "recently , the possibility that quantum fluctuations induce a topology change , was also explored in the context of gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "a semi - classical approach was adopted , where the graviton one - loop contribution to a classical energy in a background space - time was computed through a variational approach with gaussian trial wave functionals @xcite ( note that the latter approach is very close to the gravitational geon considered by anderson and brill @xcite , where the relevant difference lies in the averaging procedure ) .",
    "the energy density of the graviton one - loop contribution , or equivalently the background space - time , was then let to evolve , and consequently the classical energy was determined .",
    "more specifically , the background metric was fixed to be minkowskian in the equation governing the quantum fluctuations , which behaves essentially as a backreaction equation , and the quantum fluctuations were let to evolve ; the classical energy , which depends on the evolved metric functions , is then evaluated . analyzing this procedure ,",
    "a natural ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff was obtained , which forbids the presence of an interior space - time region , and may result in a multiply - connected space - time .",
    "thus , in the context of gravity s rainbow , this process may be interpreted as a change in topology , and in principle results in the presence of a planckian wormhole .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the dynamical generation of wormholes in a quadratic gravity theory depending on the invariants @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are planck scale - suppressed [ see eq.([eq : grav - lagrangian ] ) below for details ] .",
    "this theory is formulated _ a la _ palatini , which means that the metric and connection are regarded as independent entities .",
    "though in the case of general relativity ( gr ) this formulation is equivalent to the standard metric approach ( where the connection is imposed _ a priori _ to be given by the christoffel symbols of the metric ) this is not so for modified gravity . interestingly , the palatini formulation yields second - order field equations that in vacuum boil down to those of gr and , consequently , are ghost - free , as opposed to the usual shortcomings that plague the metric formulation . to probe the dynamics of our theory , in a series of papers @xcite we have studied spherically symmetric black holes with electric charge . as a result we have found electrovacuum solutions that macroscopically are in excellent qualitative agreement with the standard reissner - nordstrm solution of gr , but undergo important modifications in their innermost structure",
    "indeed , the gr singularity is generically replaced by a wormhole structure with a throat radius of order @xmath8 .",
    "the behaviour of the curvature invariants at @xmath9 shows that for a particular charge - to - mass ratio the space - time is completely regular .",
    "the topologically non - trivial character of the wormhole allows us to define the electric charge in terms of lines of electric force trapped in the topology , such that the density of lines of force is given by a universal quantity ( independent of the specific amounts of mass and charge ) .",
    "these facts allow to consistently interpret these solutions as geons in wheeler s sense @xcite and raise the question on the true meaning of curvature divergences in our theory since their existence seems to pose no obstacle for the wormhole extension .",
    "let us note that these wormhole solutions correspond to static solutions of the field equations .",
    "here we shall see that such solutions can be dynamically generated by probing the minkowski space with a charged null fluid . in this way we obtain a charged vaidya - type metric such that when the flux is switched off , the space - time settles down into a reissner - nordstrm - like configuration containing a wormhole structure and thus a multiply - connected topology in its interior .",
    "as we shall see , these results have important consequences for the issue of the foam - like structure of space - time .",
    "this work largely extends the results and discussion of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we present the palatini formalism for ricci - squared theories that are used throughout the paper . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] , we consider general electrovacuum scenarios with a charged null fluid , and in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] we solve the gravitational field equations . in sec .",
    "[ secv ] , we analyze the different contributions to the metric and discuss some particular scenarios .",
    "a discussion on the physical implications of these results follows in sec .",
    "[ secvi ] , where we conclude with a brief summary and some future perspectives .",
    "our initial setup corresponds to that of a generic palatini lagrangian coupled to matter , defined by the following action @xmath10=\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g}f(r , q ) + s_m[g,\\psi_m ]   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 represents the gravity lagrangian , @xmath12 is a constant with suitable dimensions ( in gr , @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the space - time metric , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the riemann tensor constructed by the connection @xmath19 .",
    "the term @xmath20 $ ] represents the matter action , where @xmath21 are the matter fields , to be specified later .    to obtain the field equations from the action ( [ eq : action ] ) , in the palatini approach one assumes that the connection @xmath22 , which defines the affine structure , is _ a priori _ independent of the metric , which defines the chrono - geometric structure ( see @xcite for a pedagogical discussion ) .",
    "this approaches reduces the number of assumptions on the structure of spacetime beyond gr , and has important consequences for the dynamics of the theory , as we shall see later .",
    "the variational principle thus leads to two sets of field equations resulting from the variation of ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric and connection as @xmath23&=&0   \\ ,   \\label{eq : con - varx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . in deriving these field equations , for simplicity",

    "it can be shown that @xmath26 is algebraically related to @xmath14 and the stress - energy tensor of matter .",
    "in fact , in terms of the object @xmath30 , we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : met - varx ] ) as @xmath31 or , in matrix form , as ( here a hat denotes a matrix ) @xmath32 which represents a quadratic algebraic equation for @xmath30 as a function of @xmath33 .",

    "since @xmath26 and @xmath14 are algebraically related , it follows that @xmath14 also verifies second - order equations .",
    "additionally , we note that in vacuum , @xmath40 , implies that @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42 , where the explicit form of @xmath43 can be found straightforwardly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : met - varrq2 ] ) . however , this is not essential for the current discussion .",

    "( [ eq : fieldequations ] ) tells us that @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 constant ( and identical in an appropriate system of units ) .",

    "in this scenario , the initial @xmath292 configuration could be seen as consisting of two identical pieces of minkowski space - time connected along the line @xmath248 ( see fig .",

    "the energy deficit resulting from the generation of this pair would be released when the pair meets and the wormholes disappear . in this picture ,",
    "the universe that we perceive would thus be a copy of another universe containing the same particles but with opposite charges ( due to the different orientation of the fluxes on each side of the wormholes ) .",

    "we have worked out a simplified scenario of gravitational collapse in which new gravitational physics at high energies is introduced by means of quadratic curvature corrections in the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "we have made use of two elements that simplify the mathematical analysis , namely , 1 ) spherical symmetry , and 2 ) a pressureless fluid .",
    "these simplifications have been traditionally used in theoretical discussions about gravitational collapse and the study of the properties of singularities . obviously , neither 1 ) nor 2 ) can be exactly realized in nature but , nonetheless , they are very useful for theoretical analysis of the type considered here .",
    "note , in this sense , that already in the first models of gravitational collapse worked out by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite , the internal pressures of the collapsing fluids were neglected as it was understood that , above a certain threshold , rather than helping to prevent the collapse they contribute to increase the energy density , which further accelerates the process .",
    "similarly , in the case of electrically charged black holes ( the well - known reissner - nordstrm solution ) , for instance , the repulsive electric force of the collapsed matter does not help to alleviate the strength of the central singularity .",
    "rather , the squared of the riemann tensor increases its degree of divergence , going from @xmath304 in the schwarzschild case to @xmath305 in the charged case .",
    "the energy of the electric field , therefore , worsens the degree of divergence of the curvature scalars .    in our model ,",
    "we have considered a radiation fluid carrying a certain amount of energy and also electric charge .",
    "the repulsive forces or pressures that the particles making up the fluid could feel have been neglected as they are not essential for the study of the end state of the collapse . as a result",
    ", the fluid follows geodesics of the metric , which have been determined dynamically by taking into account the energy and charge conveyed by the fluid . the fluid motion ,",
    "therefore , is not given a priori , but follows from the consistent resolution of the coupled system of radiation , electric field , and gravity .",
    "the key point of this work has been the study of the end state of the collapse of this idealized system . in general relativity",
    ", this configuration unavoidably leads to the formation of a point - like singularity . in our model",
    ", however , the geometry and the topology undergo important changes .",
    "when the energy density of the collapsing fluid reaches a certain scale ( of order the planck scale ) , gravity is no longer attractive and becomes repulsive .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the geodesics followed by the fluid which , rather than focusing into a point - like singularity , expand into a growing sphere .",
    "the wormhole is thus somehow produced by the repulsive character of gravitation at high energy - densities and the need to conserve the electric flux .    in principle , in our model wormholes of arbitrary charge and mass can be formed . however , this can not be completely true since our results are valid as long as the approximations involved hold with sufficient accuracy .",
    "therefore , one should note that in low - energy scenarios pressure and other dispersion effects should act so as to prevent the effective concentration of charge and energy way before it can concentrate at planckian scales , thus suppressing wormhole production .",
    "however , for adequate concentrations of charge and energy , gravitational collapse can not be halted and our analysis should be regarded as a good approximation . in this sense , we note that hawking already analyzed the process of classical collapse in the early universe , finding that ( primordial ) black holes with a planck mass or higher and up to 30 units of charge could be formed out of a charged plasma @xcite .",
    "stellar collapse offers another robust mechanism to generate the conditions under which our approximations are valid .",
    "in fact , in order to build a completely regular configuration with a solar mass , about @xmath306 protons , one needs @xmath307 electrons @xcite , which is a tiny fraction of the total available charge ( @xmath308 ) and mass .",
    "therefore , the generation of wormholes under realistic situations is possible .",
    "the dynamical generation of wormholes outlined above , in the context of charged fluids in quadratic palatini gravity , differs radically in nature to the construction of general relativistic traversable wormholes , with the idealization of impulsive phantom radiation considered extensively in the literature @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "it was shown that two opposing streams of phantom radiation , which form an infinitely thin null shell , may support a static traversable wormhole @xcite .",
    "essentially , one begins with a schwarzschild black hole region , and triggers off beams of impulsive phantom radiation , with constant energy density profiles , from both sides symmetrically , consequently forming vaidya regions .",
    "now , in principle , if the energies and the emission timing are adequately synchronized , the regions left behind the receding impulses after the collision results in a static traversable wormhole geometry .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that it was shown that with a manipulation of the impulsive beams , it is possible to enlarge the traversable wormhole ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these solutions differ radically from the self - inflating wormholes discovered numerically @xcite and the possibility that inflation might provide a natural mechanism for the enlargement of planck - size wormholes to macroscopic size @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that the amount of enlargement can be controlled by the amount of energy or the timing of the impulses , so that a reduction of the wormhole size is also possible by reversing the process of positive - energy and negative - energy impulses outlined in @xcite .",
    "the theory presented here allows to generate static wormholes by means of a finite pulse of charged radiation , without the need to keep two energy streams active continuously or to synchronize them in any way across the wormhole . regarding the size of the wormholes",
    ", we note that if instead of using @xmath121 to characterize the curvature corrections one considers a different length scale , say @xmath309 , then their area would be given by @xmath310 , where @xmath311 , @xmath312 is the number of charges , and @xmath313 . though this could allow to reach sizes orders of magnitude larger than the planck scale , it does not seem very likely that macroscopic wormholes could arise from any viable theory of this form , though the role that other matter / energy sources could produce might be nontrivial .",
    "relative to the issue of classical singularities , the meaning and implications of the latter has been a subject of intense debate in the literature for years .",
    "their existence in gr is generally interpreted as a signal of the limits of the theory , where quantum effects should become relevant and an improved theory would be necessary .",
    "this is , in fact , the reason that motivates our heuristic study of quadratic corrections beyond gr .",
    "as pointed out above and shown in detail in @xcite , the curvature divergences for the static wormhole solutions arising in quadratic palatini gravity with electrovacuum fields ( and also in the palatini version of the eddington - inspired born - infeld theory of gravity , see @xcite ) are much weaker than their counterparts in gr ( from @xmath314 in gr to @xmath315 in our model ) .",
    "additionally , the existence of a wormhole structure that prevents the function @xmath69 from dropping below the scale @xmath316 implies that the total energy stored in the electric field is finite ( see @xcite for details ) , which clearly contrasts with the infinite result that gr yields .",
    "therefore , even though curvature scalars may diverge , physical magnitudes such as total mass - energy , electric charge , and density of lines of force are insensitive to those divergences , which demands for an in - depth analysis of their meaning and implications . in this sense",
    ", we note that topology is a more primitive concept than geometry , in the sense that the former can exist without the latter .",
    "comparison between a sphere and a cube is thus pertinent and enlightening in this context to better understand the physical significance of curvature divergences .",
    "it turns out that a cube and a sphere are topological equivalent .",
    "however , the geometry of the former is ill - defined along its edges and vertices .",
    "the divergent behavior of curvature scalars for certain values of @xmath272 , therefore , simply indicates that for those cases the geometry is not smooth enough at the wormhole throat , but that does not have any impact on the physical existence of the wormhole .    regarding the existence of curvature divergences at @xmath248 in the schwarzschild case ( @xmath292 ) , our view is that there exist reasons to believe that such divergences could be an artifact of the approximations and symmetries involved in our analysis .",
    "these suspects are supported by the fact that radiation fluids ( with equation of state @xmath317 ) in cosmological scenarios governed by the dynamics of the theory under study are able to avoid the big bang singularity , which is replaced by a cosmic bounce @xcite . for the radiation fluid",
    ", the cosmic bounce occurs in both isotropic and anisotropic homogeneous scenarios when the energy density approaches the planck scale .",
    "one would thus expect that a process of collapse mimicking the oppenheimer - snyder model with a radiation fluid should avoid the development of curvature divergences .",
    "this , in fact , occurs in eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity @xcite , studied recently in @xcite .",
    "the generic existence of curvature divergences in the uncharged case involving a vaidya - type scenario with null fluids is thus likely to be due to the impossibility of normalizing the null fluid , which is therefore insensitive to the existence of a limiting density scale .",
    "the consideration of more realistic non - null charged fluids could thus help to improve the current picture and avoid the shortcomings of the uncharged ( @xmath292 ) schwarzschild configurations .    as a final comment",
    ", we note that since in our theory the field equations outside the matter sources recover those of vacuum gr , birkhoff s theorem must hold in those regions .",
    "this means that for @xmath277 we have minkowski space , whereas for @xmath282 we have a reissner - nordstrm - like geometry of the form ( [ eq : ds2static1 ] ) .",
    "the departure from reissner - nordstrm is due to the planck scale corrections of the lagrangian , which are excited by the presence of an electric field , and only affect the microscopic structure , which is of order @xmath318 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : static ] and @xcite ) . due to the spherical symmetry and the second - order character of the field equations ,",
    "birkhoff s theorem guarantees the staticity of the solutions for @xmath282 .    to conclude , in this work",
    "an exact analytical solution for the dynamical process of collapse of a null fluid carrying energy and electric charge has been found in a quadratic extension of gr formulated  la palatini .",
    "this scenario extends the well - known vaidya - bonnor solution of gr @xcite , thus allowing to explore in detail new physics at the planck scale . in the context of the static configurations",
    ", we have shown that wormholes can be formed out of minkowski space by means of a pulse of charged radiation , which contrasts with previous approaches in the literature requiring artificial configurations and synchronization of two streams of phantom energy .",

    "<S> the dynamical generation of wormholes within an extension of general relativity ( gr ) containing ( planck s scale - suppressed ) ricci - squared terms is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is formulated assuming the metric and connection to be independent ( palatini formalism ) and is probed using a charged null fluid as a matter source . </S>",
    "<S> this has the following effect : starting from minkowski space , when the flux is active the metric becomes a charged vaidya - type one , and once the flux is switched off the metric settles down into a static configuration such that far from the planck scale the geometry is virtually indistinguishable from that of the standard reissner - nordstrm solution of gr . </S>",
    "<S> however , the innermost region undergoes significant changes , as the gr singularity is generically replaced by a wormhole structure . </S>",
    "<S> such a structure becomes completely regular for a certain charge - to - mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nontrivial topology of the wormhole allows to define a charge in terms of lines of force trapped in the topology such that the density of lines flowing across the wormhole throat becomes a universal constant . </S>",
    "<S> to the light of our results we comment on the physical significance of curvature divergences in this theory and the topology change issue , which support the view that space - time could have a foam - like microstructure pervaded by wormholes generated by quantum gravitational effects . </S>"
