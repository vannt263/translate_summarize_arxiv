    "<S> in this paper , space - time block codes ( stbcs ) with reduced sphere decoding complexity ( sdc ) are constructed for two - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) fading multiple access channels . in this set - up , </S>",
    "<S> both the users employ identical stbcs and the destination performs sphere decoding for the symbols of the two users . </S>",
    "<S> first , we identify the positions of the zeros in the @xmath0 matrix arising out of the q - r decomposition of the lattice generator such that ( i ) the worst case sdc ( wsdc ) and ( ii ) the average sdc ( asdc ) are reduced . </S>",
    "<S> then , a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the lattice generator is provided such that the @xmath0 matrix has zeros at the identified positions . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , explicit constructions of stbcs which results in the reduced asdc are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the rate ( in complex symbols per channel use ) of the proposed designs is at most @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the number of transmit antennas for each user . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the class of stbcs from complex orthogonal designs ( other than the alamouti design ) reduce the wsdc but not the asdc .    </S>",
