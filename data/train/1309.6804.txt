    "the presence of heavy elements in the atmosphere of many cool white dwarfs is attributed to circumstellar debris that are continuously or intermittently accreted onto the white dwarf surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "questions remain as to the phase and composition of the accreted material and its effect on the white dwarf abundance pattern . @xcite and @xcite estimate that approximately 25% of cool , h - rich white dwarfs show the presence of metal lines in their spectra , while @xcite found that a similar fraction of he - rich white dwarfs show metal lines .",
    "@xcite explored the link between heavy element pollution in white dwarfs and the presence of a warm , near - infrared ( ir ) debris disk feeding the photosphere as in the case of the proto - typical dusty , polluted white dwarf g29 - 38 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite reported that only 21% of polluted white dwarfs have mid - ir excess consistent with a circumstellar disk and they also noted an increased likelihood of a mid - ir excess for objects with a higher calcium abundance ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "actually , @xcite observed several polluted h - rich ( daz ) and he - rich ( dz ) white dwarfs with _",
    "spitzer _ and found that the debris disks have varying thickness and , therefore , some of these may be narrow enough to escape detection .",
    "moreover , @xcite shows that polluted white dwarfs that do not exhibit an ir excess may still be experiencing gas accretion that originated from the tidal destruction of a large number of small asteroids .",
    "indeed , gaseous disks around white dwarfs were detected via near - ir calcium triplet emission @xcite .",
    "various accretion scenarios or many types of sources may be involved .",
    "for example , the immediate environment of white dwarf stars is likely composed of remnant bodies that survived post - asymptotic giant branch evolution .",
    "these bodies may be low - mass stellar ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or sub - stellar companions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or disrupted planetary systems , i.e. , objects that are otherwise quite common .",
    "the formation of a debris disk could mix material and produce an abundance pattern averaged over several constituents .",
    "consequently , the observed abundance would be representative of the stellar neighborhood .",
    "however , single body accretion could deliver a greater diversity of abundance patterns ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion history and diffusion time - scales mingle in a complex manner @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered three possible sequences of events : one of continuous accretion and built - up toward diffusive equilibrium , one at diffusive equilibrium , and , after extinction of the accretion source , one of decline in photospheric abundances .",
    "therefore , the observed abundance pattern , i.e. , the photospheric abundance ratios , may differ considerably from the source pattern , and a case - by - case study of daz white dwarfs may yet reveal considerable abundance variations .    on last count ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cool daz white dwarfs ( @xmath3 k ) are outnumbered at least 1:3 by the dz white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the number of identified daz white dwarfs in the local sample of @xcite is comparable to that of dz white dwarfs ( 11 versus 13 stars ) , although the daz count corresponds to a much smaller fraction of all h - rich white dwarfs than that of their he - rich counterparts , i.e. , one tenth versus one third , respectively .",
    "clearly , many polluted h - rich white dwarfs remain to be recognized as such in the local sample .",
    "@xcite cites difficulties in detecting weak metal lines in the opaque , neutral hydrogen environment of cool da white dwarfs .",
    "however , recent spectroscopic surveys of local white dwarf candidates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have uncovered several new cool daz white dwarfs @xcite .    in this context , we present an analysis of the polluted , otherwise hydrogen - rich white dwarf nltt  25792 from the revised new luyten two - tenth catalog @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reported the detection of a strong ca  k line but without other identifiable elements .",
    "this object is also known in the edinburgh - cape catalog as ec  10542@xmath42236 @xcite and in the luyten - palomar catalog as lp  849 - 31 .",

    "some of these measurements may well be redundant , but , in general , they should reflect on differing data sources or model atmosphere generations . in this case , the two methods delivered consistent results : ( , @xmath133 with method 1 and ( , @xmath134 with method 2 .",
    "therefore , we adopted the weighted average of all temperature and surface gravity measurements ( table  [ tbl_abun ] ) .",
    "the corresponding abundance measurements differ slightly from published values : we obtain a lower calcium abundance ( @xmath135 dex ) but a higher magnesium abundance ( 0.3 and 0.1 dex ) than in @xcite and @xcite , although our iron and aluminum abundance measurements are in good agreement ( within @xmath136 dex ) with those of @xcite .",
    "the adopted atmospheric parameters in either study are similar to those adopted in this work .",
    "variations may be attributed to different fitting techniques or model generations .",
    "the pattern is very nearly scaled on the solar pattern with @xmath60\\approx -3.4 $ ] , where x represents mg , al , ca , and fe .",
    "next , for wd  0354 + 463 we used the balmer line analysis of @xcite . the effective temperature adopted by @xcite was close to 500  k cooler and should affect abundance measurements .",
    "predictably , because of the higher temperature adopted in this work our abundance measurements are on average 0.19 dex higher with a dispersion of only 0.08 dex .",
    "however , the patterns are similar , except for a slight magnesium enrichment in our data . in addition , and as in the case of g74 - 7 , the calcium abundance measurements based on @xmath04226 and ca  k are formally in agreement .    for wd  1257@xmath38278 we averaged the measurements of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to which we compounded our own analysis of two available sdss spectra .",
    "we excluded a notably defective h@xmath132 line from the analysis of one of the sdss spectrum .",
    "we obtained similar parameters ( table  [ tbl_abun ] ) to those adopted by @xcite . the surface gravity ( hence mass ) obtained in the joint astrometric / photometric / spectroscopic analysis of @xcite",
    "is lower than estimated in the cited spectroscopic analyses . comparing the last two columns of table  [ tbl_abun ] we conclude that the effect on the abundance analysis of the surface gravity uncertainty is negligible .",

    "their adopted stellar parameters are nearly identical to ours ( @xmath141 k , @xmath142 ) .",
    "apart from similar iron abundances , the abundances of mg , al , and ca are approximately a factor of two lower in our work although we employed the same data set .",
    "such discrepancies may , in part , be caused by differences in the model atmospheres or by different line measurement techniques .",
    "the equivalent width measurement of weak lines are notably affected by the choice of the integration window that may inadvertently include neighboring lines or uncalibrated continuum variations .",
    "abundance measurements based on a few lines may suffer from such systematic effects that , however , would tend to average out when including many spectral lines in the abundance measurement .",
    "spectral line fitting may still suffer from poor continuum placement but the line integration is necessarily confined to the width of the synthetic line profile .",
    "we noted that the present iron abundance measurement and that of @xcite are based on numerous lines , possibly averaging out systematic effects , and are formally in agreement .",
    "overall , and in agreement with @xcite , we found that the atmosphere of wd  1257@xmath38278 appears relatively rich in calcium , particularly relative to magnesium .",
    "the calcium abundance measured from the ca  k line , @xmath139 = -2.53\\pm0.04 $ ] , is 0.16 dex higher than measured using the @xmath04226 line and the ca  k line core is poorly fitted , although the overall line profile is well matched .",
    "this slight abundance discrepancy may suggest an effect similar to that observed in nltt  25792 although the ca  k line in wd  1257@xmath38278 does not show a notable blue shift or asymmetry .    finally , we averaged the effective temperature and surface gravity measurements of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and our own measurement of wd  1455@xmath38298 based on sdss spectroscopy .",
    "these measurements based on balmer line profiles are only marginally consistent with the parallax that implies a larger stellar radius hence lower gravity : wd  1455@xmath38298 is a suspected double degenerate @xcite .",
    "however , h@xmath46 and other lines only show single components",
    ". moreover , the sed ( appendix 1 ) does not show evidence of a cool companion .",
    "this discrepancy remains unresolved .",
    "the atmosphere of wd  1455@xmath38298 is the cleanest of the sample with an average metallicity index of only @xmath60=-3.7 $ ] where x represents mg , ca , and fe .",
    "our new abundance measurements differ on average with those of @xcite by only @xmath143 dex but with a dispersion of 0.2 dex .",
    "the increased signal to noise ratio in recent koa data resulted in more accurate abundance measurements and a clear detection of the @xmath144 line .",
    "the present analysis indicates a modest enrichment in magnesium relative to calcium and iron .",
    "the present calcium and iron abundance measurements in wd  1455@xmath38298 supercede those presented earlier in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the abundance patterns in the five objects analyzed .",
    "the patterns for both g74 - 7 , wd  0354@xmath38463 , and wd  1455@xmath38298 do not suggest calcium enhancement , but those of nltt  25792 and wd  1257@xmath38278 show a clear enhancement relative to all other elements .",
    "the calcium to magnesium ratio is the most revealing with an enhancement relative to solar of @xmath145 in nltt  25792 and @xmath146 in wd  1257@xmath38278 .",
    "interestingly , the patterns for wd  0354 + 463 and wd  1455 + 298 show a reversed trend with calcium at its lowest abundance relative to magnesium in the sample , @xmath147 and @xmath148 below solar . overall , the abundance pattern in g74 - 7 is flat , with a slightly lower iron abundance than the average pattern .",
    "diffusion effects , i.e. , the effects of varying diffusion time scales on the observed abundances , are likely to alter the observed abundance pattern relative to the supplied , i.e , accreted pattern ( see a discussion in section 4 ) .",
    "modelling of the ca  k line remains unsatisfactory : the line profile appears deeper and blue - shifted relative to the best fit model to all calcium lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "incidentally , the line did not vary in strength between the fors1 and x - shooter observations .",
    "the line width is dominated by collisions with hydrogen atoms . at the temperature and density conditions prevalent in the atmosphere of nltt  25792",
    ", we estimate that 80% of the total width @xmath149 is contributed by hydrogen atoms and only 20% by electrons .",
    "increasing @xmath149 by a factor of two does increase the equivalent width by 33% although it does not displace the line further toward the blue . on the other hand ,",
    "strong lines , such as the balmer or the ca  h&k lines , are visibly affected by the atmospheric structure over a wide range of depths , but we noted that the h@xmath132 and h@xmath46 line wings and deep cores measured with x - shooter are well modeled .",
    "an accumulation of calcium above the convection zone could result in a stronger line core than predicted by our homogeneous models .",
    "alternatively , the excess absorption in the ca  k line and the velocity offset could be interpreted as evidence of a nebular component to the observed profile with an equivalent width of @xmath150m  and at a relative velocity of @xmath1 .",
    "correcting for the gravitational redshift ( @xmath151 ) , the average velocity of the gas relative to the surface is @xmath152 .",
    "adopting velocity dispersion appropriate for local interstellar gas at @xmath153k , i.e. , @xmath154 , an exceedingly large column density @xmath155(@xmath156 would be required to fill in the observed absorption at a relative velocity of @xmath1 . however , allowing a larger velocity dispersion of @xmath157 , i.e. , typical of the range of projected orbital velocity for gas transiting in front of the stellar disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a lower density of @xmath155(@xmath158 is found .",
    "this simple geometrical effect helps locate the gas at a radius @xmath159 well within a tidal disruption radius of 100@xmath160 .",
    "note that in this analysis it would be more appropriate to adopt rotational broadening function rather than gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "an origin in the interstellar medium is unlikely .",
    "the absorption largely exceeds measurements of interstellar k line widths ( @xmath161 m ) up to distances of 400 pc @xcite . assuming a maximum volume density of @xmath162 @xmath163 , the total column density at the distance of nltt  25792 ( @xmath164 pc ) would be @xmath165 ions @xmath166 . in conditions typical of the local ism",

    "the corresponding equivalent width is only a few m .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the excess absorption would originate in the interstellar medium .",
    "we conclude that it probably originates in a gaseous circumstellar environment .",
    "the presence of ionized gas in the circumstellar environment of daz white dwarfs is well documented ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and revealed mostly by ir calcium triplet emission , although @xcite noted excess absorption in ultraviolet spectra of the hot daz pg  0843@xmath38516 that could also originate in a hot circumstellar environment . the x - shooter spectra of nltt  25792 show the ir calcium triplet in absorption .",
    "the daz wd  1257@xmath38278 also shows excess absorption in the ca  h&k lines although the hires spectrum does not show an obvious line shift or asymmetry .",
    "again , the absorption profile resulting from transiting gas follows a rotational broadening function that may be hidden within the combined profile .",
    "the presence of circumstellar ca  k line in daz spectra is analogous to absorption in the circumstellar environment of hot white dwarfs .",
    "ionized species of carbon and silicon are found in circumstellar environment of hot white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite ascribed those features to a strmgren sphere in the interstellar medium excited by ultraviolet radiation emanated by the white dwarf , although @xcite also cite the possibility of evaporating circumstellar debris in the intense ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "clearly , young white dwarfs may be surrounded by even denser material than their older , daz counterparts .",
    "we measured the metallicity in the atmosphere of the daz white dwarf nltt  25792 based on the detection of magnesium , aluminum , calcium and iron lines in x - shooter spectra of this object .",
    "the average abundance of these elements relative to solar on a logarithmic scale is @xmath60\\approx -2.5 $ ] dex . on the same scale ,",
    "the upper limits to the sodium and silicon abundances are @xmath169\\lesssim -3.1 $ ] and @xmath170\\lesssim -3.0 $ ] .",
    "the atmosphere of nltt  25792 appears relatively rich in calcium , but relatively poorer in sodium , magnesium , and silicon .",
    "also , the ca  k line appeared both deeper and offset than predicted by our models suggesting the presence of circumstellar gas .",
    "the absence of ir calcium triplet emission implies a lack of ionizing radiation concordant with the relatively low effective temperature of nltt  25792 ( @xmath171k ) compared to other daz white dwarfs with gaseous disks ( @xmath172k , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or their he - rich counterparts with comparable ionizing flux ( e.g. , sdss  j0738 + 1835 with @xmath173 k , * ? ? ?",
    "disk modeling by @xcite shows that emission lines , such as the ir calcium triplet , occurs within the gaseous disk at temperatures of @xmath174k and inside the tidal radius .",
    "chemical diversity in the atmosphere of accreting white dwarfs may be attributed to diversity in source compositions .",
    "for example , the daz nltt  43806 @xcite appears to be iron deficient prompting @xcite to propose that this deficiency along with a calcium / aluminum enrichment implies that the white dwarf may be accreting predominantly  earth - type lithosphere \" material .",
    "moreover , @xcite found evidence of chemical diversity in a sample of warm ( @xmath175 k ) white dwarfs , particularly in the form of an overabundance of iron that implies differentiation in the accretion flow .",
    "another explanation for chemical diversity is the time dependence of the accretion flow and atmospheric diffusion .",
    "diffusion time - scales at the bottom of the convection zone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) koester / astrophysics/ and dated january 2013 . ] range from @xmath176 to @xmath177 yrs for a hydrogen - rich white dwarf with an effective temperature close to 8000k such as nltt  25792 .",
    "this time - scale is nearly instantaneous relative to the age of the white dwarf ( @xmath178 yrs ) .",
    "however , we may well speculate that a time scale of @xmath179 yrs is comparable or longer than the time lapse between single accretion events that would result in time - variable abundances .",
    "this complicated history may be summarized with two extreme examples related to calcium and iron : in the first , our observations took place shortly ( @xmath180 ) after the accretion event and the abundances simply reflect the accretion source . in this case , the body accreted onto nltt  25792 must have been moderately enriched in calcium relative to iron . in the second example , the observations took place long after the accretion event ( @xmath181 ) and , following @xcite , the abundances follow an exponential decline @xmath182 , so that the abundance ratio of element x relative to y follows : @xmath183 if @xmath184 , as in the case of calcium ( x ) versus iron ( y ) , then x ( calcium ) would gradually dominate over y ( iron ) on a time - scale comparable to diffusion time - scales . numerically , @xmath185 in conditions appropriate for nltt  25792 , so that before all elements disappear from the atmosphere at , say , @xmath186 the calcium abundance would be enhanced by a factor of 1.4 to 1.6 relative to initial conditions . assuming initially solar abundances this calcium - to - iron abundance ratio is nearly the ratio observed in nltt  25792 ( @xmath187 , see table  [ tbl_abun ] ) and there would be no need to assume a calcium - rich accretion source .",
    "a similar exercise involving the calcium to magnesium abundance ratio necessarily implies a shortage of magnesium in the accretion source because their respective diffusion time - scales are nearly equal .",
    "the same situation holds for sodium .    in steady state accretion ,",
    "the observed abundance ratios are simply given by @xmath188 in this case we would have expected an excess of 0.11 to 0.17 dex of the calcium to iron ratio relative to a source assumed to be solar , i.e. , close to excess observed in nltt  25792 ( @xmath189 ) . however , examining other abundance ratios should help constrain the abundance pattern of the accretion source .",
    "for example , sodium , magnesium , and calcium have nearly identical diffusion time scales but we found a significant deficit in sodium and magnesium relative to solar with @xmath190 \\lesssim -0.7 $ ] and @xmath191 = -0.4 $ ] .",
    "diffusion time scales for silicon are uncertain .",
    "the calculations of @xcite indicate a longer time scale for silicon than calcium , although the recent on - line data indicate the opposite . in either case , the silicon time scale is longer than that of iron for conditions found in nltt  25792 implying that the silicon deficit ( @xmath192 \\lesssim -0.4 $ ] , @xmath193 \\lesssim -0.6 $ ] ) can only be explained by its absence in the accretion source . assuming steady state , we conclude that the accretion source shows a deficit in sodium , magnesium and silicon relative to calcium and iron .",
    "the aluminum abundance does not significantly depart from solar abundance ratios .",
    "interestingly , @xcite finds that a deficit in sodium relative to solar in some dz stars would occur while accreting `` bulk earth '' material , although an explanation for a similar deficit in silicon is not forthcoming .    in summary , and following @xcite , the estimated steady - state accretion rates onto the white dwarf nltt  25792 are @xmath194gs@xmath8 , @xmath195gs@xmath8 , and @xmath196gs@xmath8 , and using on - line data from d. koester we estimate @xmath197gs@xmath8 .",
    "this limited daz sample already suggests that the circumstellar environment varies significantly .",
    "abundance ratios , more particularly @xmath191 $ ] , vary considerably within this sample , from @xmath191 = -0.4 $ ] in nltt  25792 to @xmath191 = + 0.27 $ ] in wd  0354@xmath38463 .",
    "the reasons for these variations are not known .",
    "the ratios @xmath190 $ ] and @xmath193 $ ] in nltt  25792 fall well below solar ratios and this deficit must originate in the accretion source , although the precise circumstances surrounding accretion of circumstellar material onto cool white dwarfs remain uncertain . in this context , a correlation found between condensation temperature of accreted constituents and corresponding photospheric abundances in a helium - rich polluted white dwarf ( dbz ) may offer come clues to the exact nature of the accretion mechanism @xcite . in a broader context , the calcium to iron abundance ratio in dz and daz stars alike is known to vary by well over an order of magnitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although we find this ratio to be rather homogeneous within our sample . on the other hand , @xcite measured large dispersions ( 0.4 to 0.6 dex ) in the abundance ratio distributions ( na , mg , ca , and fe ) of a large dz sample .",
    "the present study shows that such variations occur between magnesium and other elements within a sample of closely related daz white dwarfs .",
    "new spectroscopy with a higher dispersion than achieved with x - shooter ( @xmath198 ) would be useful in resolving the ca  k line profile into its photospheric and circumstellar components , if any .",
    "more importantly , the existence of polluted , magnetic white dwarfs ( e.g. , nltt  10480 and nltt43806 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be linked to field - generating accretion or interaction events @xcite .",
    "the detection of magnetic fields weaker than 20 kg is not possible at the resolution achieved with x - shooter but high - dispersion spectroscopy of cool daz white dwarfs may help reinforce a link between accretion events and magnetic field generation in compact objects .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of x - shooter spectra of the polluted , hydrogen - rich white dwarf nltt  25792 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show strong lines of calcium ( ca  h&k , near - infrared calcium triplet , and @xmath04226 ) and numerous lines of iron along with magnesium and aluminum lines from which we draw the abundance pattern . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the photospheric ca  h&k lines are possibly blended with a circumstellar component shifted by @xmath1  relative to the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with a sample of four white dwarfs with similar parameters show considerable variations in their abundance patterns , particularly in the calcium to magnesium abundance ratio that varies by a factor of five within this sample . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variations , even after accounting for diffusion effects , imply similar variations in the putative accretion source . </S>",
    "<S> also , we find that silicon and sodium are significantly underabundant in the atmosphere of nltt  25792 , a fact that may offer some clues on the nature of the accretion source . </S>"
