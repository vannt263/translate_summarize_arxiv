    "the construction of these functions is based on two results .",
    "first , in theorem [ teobigbang ] we show that after a cut and paste procedure every isolated set is the intersection of an attractor with a repeller .",

    "as we will see , the difficulty of this task depends on the form of expansivity that we consider and if we are dealing with flows or homeomorphisms .",
    "let us give an example illustrating the main concepts of the paper .",
    "consider the differential equations in the plane : @xmath1 this system determines a hyperbolic equilibrium point of saddle type at the origin .",
    "its solutions are given by @xmath2 .",

    "we have that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "consequently @xmath6 .",
    "as usual , the dots indicate time derivatives .",
    "when a function satisfies @xmath6 we call it _ catenary function _ for the flow @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 is the distance induced by the norm @xmath9 , we have that @xmath10 , and we call it _ catenary metric_. in this example @xmath11 is an isolated set because there is a compact neighborhood @xmath12\\times[-1,1]$ ] of @xmath13 , satisfying : the whole orbit of a point is contained in @xmath14 if and only if the point is in @xmath13 . in theorem [ teocatmetset ] we will show that every isolated point admits a catenary metric and that every isolated set admits a catenary pseudo - metric vanishing on pairs of points of the isolated set .",
    "this result will be proved for partial flows on metric spaces . in theorem [ teocatfuniso ]",
    "we show that every isolated set admits a catenary function @xmath9 .",
    "the construction of lyapunov functions is a classical tool for proving the asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point of a differential equation . in @xcite massera",
    "considered the converse problem in the setting of autonomous or periodic differential equations in @xmath15 .",
    "he showed that every asymptotically stable singular point admits a positive and decreasing lyapunov function of class @xmath16 . from a topological viewpoint , i.e. lyapunov functions of class @xmath17",
    ", simpler constructions can be made even on metric spaces , see for example @xcite . in section [ secattrep ] we will show that every attractor admits a positive and decreasing lyapunov function @xmath9 satisfying @xmath18 , which is a key step in the construction of a catenary function for an isolated set . in theorem [ teocatattdiff ]",
    "we apply massera s theorem to construct a differentiable lyapunov function @xmath9 for an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of a differential equation in @xmath15 satisfying @xmath19 for a suitable positive constant @xmath20 .    in topological dynamics",
    "the role of hyperbolicity can be played by expansivity . recall that a homeomorphism @xmath21 of a compact metric space is _ expansive _",
    "if there is @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 implies @xmath25 . as noted by utz in @xcite expansivity",
    "is related with isolated sets as follows : a homeomorphism is expansive if and only if the diagonal @xmath26 is an isolated set for the homeomorphism @xmath27 in @xmath28 . in @xcite",
    "the expression _ isolated set _ is not used , but in the proof of @xcite*theorem 2.1 the concept is clearly present . for the study of expansive systems lewowicz @xcite introduced lyapunov functions , see also @xcite .",
    "he proved that expansiveness is equivalent with the existence of a function @xmath29 defined on a neighborhood @xmath14 of the diagonal @xmath13 and satisfying that @xmath9 and @xmath30 vanish on @xmath13 and are positive in @xmath31 .",
    "in the discrete time case @xmath32 may be defined as @xmath33 .",
    "we will show in theorem [ catexp ] that this function @xmath9 can be constructed in such a way that @xmath34 also holds .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 can be evaluated at every small compact subset of @xmath35 ( not only at pairs of points ) . in @xcite fathi constructed an _ adapted hyperbolic metric _ for an arbitrary expansive homeomorphism of a compact metric space @xmath35 .",

    "we study sufficient conditions in order to obtain a catenary metric , instead of a local metric , for an expansive homeomorphism . for dynamical systems with continuous time",
    "we consider expansive flows as defined in @xcite . in section [ secexpflow ] we state this definition in terms of isolated sets .",
    "it is done using local cross sections . in theorem [ teocatmetexpflow ]",
    "we prove that every expansive flow admits a hyperbolic metric of catenary type defined on local cross sections .",
    "let us explain the meaning of the _ catenary condition_. in the continuous - time case @xmath45 implies that @xmath46 for suitable constants @xmath47 depending on @xmath43 . as a consequence we obtain a function @xmath48 that is a constant of motion .",
    "in the discrete - time case , if for a fixed @xmath43 we define @xmath49 we have that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the solutions of @xmath54 then @xmath55 .",
    "this shows that the catenary property gives us a nice control of the hyperbolic behavior of the values that @xmath9 takes along the orbits of a discrete or continuous dynamical system .",

    "[ secisolated ] we consider isolated sets for partial flows .",
    "partial flows appear naturally when the solutions of a differential equation are not defined for all @xmath56 . for a partial flow",
    "we consider its enveloping flow as defined in @xcite .",
    "the enveloping flow is an abstract continuation of the trajectories that are not defined for all @xmath56 . in general",
    "this enveloping is defined in a topological space that may not be hausdorff .",
    "this can be the case even if the original partial flow is defined on a metric space .",
    "in example [ ejnohausdorff ] this phenomenon is illustrated .",
    "applying results from @xcite we solve the problem of finding hausdorff enveloping spaces for isolated sets .",
    "we show in theorem [ teoenvmet ] that every isolated set has a neighborhood with metrizable enveloping space .",
    "this result allows us to understand that in the study of an isolated set there is no loss of generality if we assume that @xmath7 is a flow instead of a partial flow .",
    "this section also gives the correct setting for the study of expansive flows in section [ secexpflow ] where expansivity is stated in terms of an isolated set of a partial flow that is not a flow .",
    "this is the reason why we start the paper studying isolated sets for partial flows .",
    "but , the main result of section [ secisolated ] is theorem [ teobigbang ] .",
    "there , a special compactification of the enveloping flow is constructed that allows us to see the isolated set as a morse set @xcite , that is , the intersection of an attractor with a repeller . in this construction",
    "two fixed points , an attractor and a repeller , are used to compactify the space , obtaining something similar with a model of the physical universe starting with a big bang and ending in a big crunch .    in section [ secattrep ]",
    "we consider attractors and repellers .",
    "we prove that every attractor admits a lyapunov function satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "also , a pseudo - metric @xmath8 satisfying @xmath58 is constructed for an attractor .",
    "it is a metric if the attractor is a singleton .",
    "these results are based on the linear models obtained in section [ seclinmodel ] .",
    "it is well known that attractors admit positive and decreasing lyapunov functions . in theorem [ estas ]",
    "we give a new proof of this result that is based on whitney s size functions .    in section [ seccatfunmet ]",

    "the result is presented as a boundary value problem that gives a method to construct more lyapunov functions of catenary type . in theorem [ teocatmetset ]",
    "we show that isolated points admits a catenary metric defined on an isolated neighborhood .",

    "we study the structure of a flow near an isolated set .",
    "we show in theorem [ teosemiconj ] that the dynamics in an isolating neighborhood of an isolated set is semi - conjugate with a _ singular flow box_. a first approximation to this concept is as follows . let @xmath61 be a smooth vector field on a manifold @xmath62 , take a non - equilibrium point @xmath63 and a flow box @xmath64 containing @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a non - negative smooth function vanishing only at @xmath65 .",

    "the purpose of this section is to prove that every isolated set can be seen as the intersection of an attractor and a repeller in what we call an _ isolating universe _ for the isolated set .",

    "this is the step 2 in figure [ figsurgery ] .",
