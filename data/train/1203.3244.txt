    "current - induced spin - wave dynamics @xcite has attracted great attention in recent years , both from applied and fundamental points of view.@xcite in terms of applications , the possibility of realizing nanoscale microwave oscillators  so - called spin - torque oscillators ( stos)is very appealing . from a fundamental perspective",
    ", this topic offers a new field of investigation in which spin - wave dynamics can be studied at reduced dimensions .    in an sto , a high - density spin - polarized direct current ( @xmath4 a/@xmath5 ) transfers part of its spin angular momentum to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) thin film via a spin - transfer torque effect.@xcite under certain conditions of the applied magnetic field and current , a sustained precession of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic film can be achieved .",
    "typically , a pseudo spin - valve stack is needed to both spin - polarize the current through one of the magnetic layers ( referred to as the `` fixed '' layer ) , and to be able to read the time - varying giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) signal arising from the magnetization precession of the other layer ( thought of as a `` free '' layer ) .",
    "indeed , the way signals are detected in these devices is as an oscillating voltage , which arises because of ohm s law , which in this case can be written as @xmath6 .",
    "stos can be realized in two geometries : nanocontacts ( ncs ) , where the only nanosized feature is the nonmagnetic electrode through which the high density current is injected , and nanopillars , in which the magnetic layers , in whole or in part , are nanosized . in this work , we will consider the case of nc - stos .",
    "these devices are particularly interesting from a fundamental perspective , because they represent an ideal system in which the characteristics of current - induced spin waves can be studied .",
    "in fact , in such devices the spin - valve stack is patterned into a larger mesa with a lateral size of several microns .",
    "this allows for the spin waves generated at the nc to be damped out before reaching the edges of the mesa , and thus avoiding eventual reflections , which may induce more complex effects in the dynamics .    a few years after the prediction of the feasibility of current - induced spin - wave excitations , slonczewski proposed that the spin waves generated in a _ perpendicularly _ magnetized nc are propagating spin waves with wavevector inversely proportional to the nc radius.@xcite while his calculations described this kind of excitation well , they were inadequate for describing the case of _ in - plane _ magnetized ncs .",
    "a theoretical solution was proposed several years later by two of the authors of this article,@xcite who demonstrated that experimental results could be better explained in terms of a self - localized spin - wave soliton  the so - called spin - wave bullet .",
    "the first studies of spin - wave dynamics in nc - stos under the effect of oblique magnetic fields were first presented in refs .  .",
    "however , it was with our previous work @xcite that it became possible to obtain definitive experimental confirmation of the two theoretical approaches .",
    "we found that the localized slavin - tiberkevich mode only exists below a certain critical angle @xmath7 , while the propagating slonczewski mode can be excited at all angles @xmath0 .",
    "the observed excitation frequencies , threshold characteristics , and frequency agility with current agree with theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations.@xcite furthermore , the very recent observations of spin - torque induced spin waves by means of micro - focused brillouin light scattering strengthen these conclusions in a direct way , proving that it is the direction of the external magnetic field that determines the character ( localized or propagating ) of the excited spin waves.@xcite    here we investigate both experimentally and by means of micromagnetic simulations the dependence of the power of the two modes on the applied magnetic field angle",
    ". the qualitative features of these two cases are remarkably different , and given the agreement between experiments and simulations , we are able to infer details of the magnetization dynamics",
    ". finally , using the analytical model that describes thermal effects in nonlinear auto - oscillators , we are able to describe the experimental angular behavior of the linewidth when only one mode is excited .",
    "when two modes are excited , the analytical model underestimates the value of the linewidth by more than one order of magnitude , and we introduce a new model in order to describe this situation .",
    "-12.6 , -14 , and -16 ma , for two different directions of the external magnetic field .",
    "( a ) for @xmath8 deg , two distinct peaks can be identified : a red - shifted lower frequency peak , identified as a localized soliton mode , and a blue - shifted higher frequency peak , identified as the propagating mode .",
    "( b ) at @xmath9 deg , only the propagating mode is observed . ]    in this work , the sto under investigation comprises a @xmath10 nm circular nc on top of a pseudo spin - valve mesa composed of a 20 nm thick co@xmath11fe@xmath12 `` fixed '' magnetic layer , a 6 nm thick cu spacer layer , and a 4.5 nm thick ni@xmath11fe@xmath12 `` free '' magnetic layer .",
    "further details of the material stack can be found in ref .  .",
    "on top of the sto , a coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) is defined to allow for both injection , through a bias - t , of a current @xmath13@xmath14 ma flowing from the biased free layer to the grounded fixed layer , and for extraction of the microwave signal generated by the device .",
    "the external contact with the cpw consists of nonmagnetic ground - signal - ground probes ( dc40 ghz ) . a constant magnetic field",
    "@xmath15 t is applied to the sample . during operation ,",
    "a current @xmath13@xmath14 ma flows from the biased free layer to the grounded fixed layer , injected via a bias - t . the microwave signal is amplified + 22 db and guided into a spectrum analyzer .",
    "details of the measurement setup are given elsewhere.@xcite we calibrated our transmission line , however , due to the wide frequency range investigated ( @xmath16 ghz ) .",
    "we are aware that the computed power will not be as accurate as in the case of our recent work,@xcite where the frequency range was much smaller ( @xmath17 mhz ) .",
    "we therefore expect a 3 db error in power ( i.e. a factor 2 ) to be unavoidable in the present measurements .",
    "nevertheless , given the variation of the sto power over several order of magnitudes as the magnetic field angle is varied , the measurements are meaningful and sufficiently accurate in this context .    in order to compare our experimental results with micromagnetic simulations , we used the data from ref .  .",
    "the sample geometry in that case was very similar , although the applied field was slightly different .",
    "since we are only interested in a qualitative understanding of the results obtained by using this experimental setup , a new full - scale ad hoc numerical study was not performed .",
    "details of the micromagnetic framework can be found in ref .  .",
    "[ fig : psdvs_freq ] summarizes the results of our previous work.@xcite in particular , it shows that for a certain angle @xmath18 ( @xmath19 deg ) , two spin - wave modes with opposite frequency agility can coexist .",
    "only one mode exists for @xmath20 .",
    "comparison with theory and micromagnetic simulations allowed us to identify the mode at lower frequency as a localized mode of solitonic character ( a spin - wave `` bullet '' ) , and the high frequency mode as a propagating mode.@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](a ) shows the measured integrated power of the two modes as a function of applied magnetic field angle .",
    "the integrated power is calculated by averaging the power at each current above the threshold current.@xcite the threshold current is obtained by the procedure illustrated in our previous work.@xcite error bars indicate the range over which the power varies at different bias currents .",
    "the propagating mode shows an approximately monotonic increase in emitted power as out - of - plane angles are approached . the localized mode , on the other hand , shows a monotonic increase in power up to an angle of @xmath21 deg , followed by a plateau up to @xmath22 deg , and then a rapid decrease down to the critical angle , above which the mode is no longer excited .    for micromagnetic simulations ,",
    "the power was computed employing the definition of nonlinear oscillation power developed in ref .  , and by then performing an analogous averaging over the current values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](b ) , we show the power computed by means of this technique , which will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "it should be noticed that the power of the propagating mode increases monotonically with the applied field angle , while the power of the localized mode increases up to the maximum at @xmath23 deg , and then undergoes a decrease down to the critical angle .",
    "[ fig : linewidth_vs_theta ] shows the measured linewidth as a function of magnetic field angle @xmath0 .",
    "the asymmetric error bars on each data point represent the upper and lower standard deviations of the data set , which is made up of the integrated power at the various current values .",
    "the localized mode has its minimum linewidth at @xmath21 deg , while for the propagating mode the linewidth minimum is at @xmath24 deg .",
    "when approaching this angle at which the localized mode disappears , the linewidth drops very sharply , by almost two orders of magnitude , as the angle is varied by @xmath25 deg .",
    "in order to describe the angular dependence of the integrated power , we use a mathematical model based on the evaluation of the nonlinear oscillation power.@xcite such a quantity , which represents a proper generalization of oscillation power to the case of spatially nonuniform and noncircular magnetization precession , is indeed found to be proportional to the integrated power computed experimentally.@xcite this model requires knowledge of the closed trajectory of the magnetization vector during precessional motion . by normalizing this vector w.r.t .",
    "the saturation magnetization , the dynamics occurs on the unit sphere .",
    "the corresponding curve splits the surface of the unit sphere into two parts : a larger part @xmath26 , and a smaller part @xmath27 .",
    "the nonlinear power @xmath28 is defined as the sum over all computational cells @xmath29 of the areas of the smaller surfaces @xmath27 : @xmath30 it should be recalled that , since the simulations performed in ref .   were based on the realistic assumption that the spin - transfer torque only dynamically affects the magnetization configuration of the thinner `` free layer '' , the formulation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_nl ] ) will therefore not account for the trajectories described by the magnetization vector of the thicker `` fixed layer '' .",
    "the results presented in fig . [ fig : intpow_vs_theta ] show that the qualitatively different experimental behaviors [ fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](a ) ] of the power of the two modes as a function of the applied field angle @xmath0 ( a monotonic increase for the propagating mode , a relative maximum for the localized mode ) can be well reproduced by micromagnetic simulations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](b ) ] . quantitative agreements are difficult to obtain for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the discrepancies between the nominal and realistic parameters values are hard to estimate .",
    "secondly , some relevant contributions arising from finite temperature effects , oersted fields , and nonlinear damping were not considered in the simulations .",
    "recent numerical investigations@xcite indeed show that a satisfying quantitative agreement between micromagnetic simulations and laboratory experiments can be only achieved in the presence of a large oersted field . in this framework",
    ", it was demonstrated that the inhomogeneities created by this field contribution drastically change the properties exhibited by both the propagating modes ( the frequency tunability , for example , can even change sign@xcite ) and localized modes ( the threshold current increases@xcite ) .",
    "one may therefore ask whether simulations that do not include the oersted field are reliable at all , even if only for qualitative comparison .    for this reason , we performed simulations including the oersted field at two selected angles @xmath31 deg and @xmath9 deg . at @xmath31 deg",
    ", we again found the same qualitative behavior as in our recent work,@xcite namely that the two spin - wave modes are excited alternately .",
    "when we compared the precession orbits with and without the inclusion of the oersted field , we observed that the effect of the oersted field is one of a slight perturbation . at @xmath32 deg",
    ", only one mode can be excited and , again , the precession orbit is only slightly changed , which in turn leads to a slight change in the computed power .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta ] by open square and filled star symbols for the spin - wave bullet and the propagating mode , respectively .",
    "for the spin - wave bullet there is no noticeable change in the computed power , while for the propagating mode the computed power is slightly lower than the case without the oersted field .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that the oersted field , while having a fundamental role in triggering the switching between the two spin - wave modes , does not perturb in a critical way the trajectory of the magnetization when a particular spin - wave mode is excited .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between the experimental and the computed power could therefore lie in ( besides the aforementioned realistic parameter estimation and finite temperature effects ) the different dwell times of the two spin - wave modes at different angles .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this article to investigate such effects .    from the results of the micromagnetic simulations , we are also able to infer the details of the magnetization dynamics . for the propagating mode",
    ", the magnetization vector describes a surface on the unit sphere whose area increases monotonically with the increase of the out - of - plane bias field angle @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](a)(c ) .",
    "this leads to the increase in power with @xmath0 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta ] .",
    "such a result can be understood considering that the demagnetizing field in the thin film is larger at larger @xmath0 , acting so as to open up the precession cone and to enlarge the corresponding precession surface .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that , at a given bias current , the precession frequency decreases when @xmath0 increases.@xcite    analogous conclusions could be drawn by using a previously - proposed simple model for the integrated power , based on the assumption that the precession orbit is circular.@xcite under this condition , the power @xmath33 can be related to the maximum gmr signal @xmath34 , to the angle between the precessional axis direction in the `` free '' layer and the magnetization in the `` fixed '' layer @xmath35 , and to the precession angle @xmath36 , through the following relationship : @xmath37    by performing a similar numerical investigation as a function of @xmath0 , one can also conclude in this case that the main effect of the increase in the out - of - plane angle is to increase the precessional cone by means of an increase in the angle @xmath36 , which in turn determines the increase in the power @xmath33 .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the linear approach employed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) is not suitable for capturing those details of the magnetization dynamics which are associated with the excitation of nonlinear localized bullet modes .",
    "in fact , the closed trajectories described on the unit sphere are , in this case , not circular in the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "elliptical clamshell - like curves are described instead .",
    "in addition , for large supercriticality , the applied current does not yield a further increase of the precession cone , but rather induces distortions in the shape of the surface .",
    "since the computed output power necessarily takes into account all these mechanisms , the nonlinear oscillation power tool of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_nl ] ) appears to be more appropriate .    in this case , the trend observed experimentally for the integrated power can be related to the expansion and contraction of the precession surface described at different out - of - plane angles . in particular , for field direction @xmath38 deg , the magnetization precession takes place about an effective field which is antiparallel to that direction , and the corresponding surface turns out to be relatively small : see fig . [",
    "fig : intpow_vs_theta](c ) .",
    "the magnetization trajectory undergoes an enlargement as the out - of - plane angle increases up to @xmath23 deg .",
    "in such a configuration , the unit vector describes an elliptical quasi - diametric path along the sphere ( @xmath39 ) , which yields a maximum in the nonlinear oscillation power : see fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](d ) . any further increase of @xmath0 induces a reduction in the precession surface w.r.t . the previous quasi - diametric path .",
    "indeed , the nonlinear power exhibits a rapid decrease down to the critical angle @xmath24 deg : see fig .",
    "[ fig : intpow_vs_theta](e ) . at this field orientation ,",
    "the magnetization trajectory associated with localized modes would become null , making excitation of these modes inconceivable .    above the critical angle ,",
    "all the power injected by the current to the system is provided to the propagating mode .      in order to properly understand linewidth broadening in stos one",
    "has to include thermal effects , which were neglected in our micromagnetic simulations ( where @xmath40 k ) .",
    "those simulations will therefore not be used in the following .",
    "instead , we rely on two different models which apply to cases where either one or two spin - wave modes can be excited . in the first case , we will use the nonlinear auto - oscillator theory developed in ref .",
    ", while for the second case we will introduce a new model in which the concept of partial coherence of the oscillator is used .",
    "according to the model in ref .  , the linewidth of a nonlinear auto - oscillator can be expressed as @xmath41 , \\label{eq : lw}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the gilbert damping rate ( ferromagnetic resonance linewidth ) , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a phenomenological coefficient which quantifies the nonlinearity of the damping.@xcite the explicit expressions for @xmath29 can be found in ref .  .",
    "@xmath50 is the angle between the stationary magnetization of the `` free '' and `` fixed '' layers , calculated by solving the magnetostatic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath51 is the modulus of the electron charge , and @xmath52 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "compared to a conventional auto - oscillator , the extra term involving the @xmath53 ratio ( whose value can vary from -@xmath54 to 30 with our material parameters ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lw ] ) is the one that governs linewidth broadening in nonlinear auto - oscillators .",
    "the angular dependence of the linewidth is also predominantly in the same @xmath53 ratio , since @xmath55 and @xmath36 are always positive and typically vary by 50% over the entire angular range .",
    "one therefore expects a minimum of the linewidth at the angle where the @xmath53 ratio is minimum .",
    "@xmath29 is a monotonic function of the applied field angle in the range @xmath56 , and it has a negative value at @xmath57 , and is positive at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , there exists an angle at which @xmath59 and where @xmath60 is minimum .",
    "this angle coincides with the critical angle @xmath7 , since the localized mode can be excited only when @xmath61 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : linewidth_vs_theta ] , we plot the theoretically calculated linewidth as a continuous line .",
    "the numerical constants were set as @xmath62 hz / t , @xmath63 t , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 nm and @xmath67 nm , which are the nominal values for our sample .",
    "we also set @xmath68 according to the theory , and @xmath69 , which is rather an intermediate value for the currents considered here .",
    "the two free parameters are the effective volume @xmath70 , which is assumed to be 10 times the volume of a cylinder with the diameter of the nanocontact and height equal to the thickness of the `` free '' magnetic layer , while @xmath71 is chosen as reasonable approximation to the spin - polarization coefficient . from fig .",
    "[ fig : linewidth_vs_theta ] , it is evident that the analytical theory correctly predicts the occurrence of the linewidth minimum at the critical angle @xmath7 .",
    "the theory can also describe the data for @xmath20 , where only one spin - wave mode is excited and the linewidth increases at larger angles .",
    "however , the analytical model underestimates the value of the linewidth by almost two orders of magnitude at angles @xmath18 , where both modes are excited .      .",
    "the oscillation phase at each burst is @xmath72 . ]    in order to explain the origin of the generation linewidth ( 500  mhz ) in the bimodal regime of generation , we start from two intuitive considerations , and from from the results of the micromagnetic simulations performed in ref .  .",
    "the first consideration is that we observed hopping between the two modes . assuming that this process is random ( a usual assumption for hopping ) , the linewidth of each mode would be equal to the inverse of the mode lifetime @xmath73 ns , @xmath74  ghz",
    "clearly , this interpretation overestimates the linewidth by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the second consideration is that at 0  k , the hopping between the two modes has a well - defined pattern .",
    "that is , the hopping is not random , but is a deterministic periodic process and therefore does not lead to linewidth broadening .",
    "the spectrum at 0  k should consist of a series of @xmath75-peaks at multiplies of the hopping frequency @xmath76 . at finite temperatures , each spectral peak",
    "will be broadened by thermal fluctuations by about the same amount as the linewidth in a single - mode regime .",
    "therefore , the generation linewidth can be estimated using the single - mode theory , @xmath77  mhz .",
    "clearly , this approach underestimates the linewidth by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the failure of both the `` completely random '' and `` completely deterministic '' pictures of mode hopping suggests that , in reality the mode hopping is only _ partially coherent_. that is , the process of persistent hopping happens even at 0  k and is deterministic .",
    "however , the power of each mode between `` bursts '' reduces by several orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bursts ] ) .",
    "when the energy of the mode is very low , it becomes much more sensitive to thermal fluctuations ( the influence of thermal fluctuations is proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mode energy ) . as a result",
    ", the phase @xmath72 of the next burst will not be exactly the same as the phase of the previous burst @xmath80 , but will have a significant random component , @xmath81 , collected during the low - power stage of the evolution of the mode . in principle , the positions @xmath82 of the bursts maxima will also be randomized , but we will neglect this effect for simplicity  it has the same qualitative influence on the linewidth as does the randomness of the phases @xmath72 ( and there are reasons to believe that the randomness in @xmath82 will be smaller than the randomness in @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus , here we will assume exact amplitude periodicity : @xmath83 .    under these assumptions , the time profile of the slow ( without trivial dependence @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the average frequency of oscillations )",
    "complex mode amplitude can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 describes the amplitude profile of one burst , and @xmath72 is the random phase of the @xmath88-th burst .",

    "we measured the power emitted by an nc spin - torque oscillator as a function of out - of - plane applied magnetic field direction .",
    "as the angle varies , two distinct spin - wave modes are excited : the slonczewski propagating mode and the slavin - tiberkevich self - localized mode ( the spin - wave bullet ) .",
    "the power of the propagating mode increases monotonically as out - of - plane angles are approached , while the power of the localized mode reaches a maximum , and then decreases towards a critical angle , above which the localized mode no longer exists . both facts",

    ", we were able to quantitatively describe the experimental observations when only one spin - wave mode is excited .",
    "when two modes are excited , the model underestimates the experimental linewidth by approximately one order of magnitude .",

    "the estimated value of the phase variance , @xmath114 , seems reasonable taking into account the substantial reduction in the power of the mode between the bursts .",

    "<S> integrated power and linewidth of a propagating and a self - localized spin wave modes excited by spin - polarized current in an obliquely magnetized magnetic nanocontact are studied experimentally as functions of the angle @xmath0 between the external bias magnetic field and the nanocontact plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the power of the propagating mode monotonically increases with @xmath0 , while the power of the self - localized mode has a broad maximum near @xmath1 deg , and exponentially vanishes near the critical angle @xmath2 deg , at which the localized mode disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth of the propagating mode in the interval of angles @xmath3 deg , where only this mode is excited , is adequtely described by the existing theory , while in the angular interval where both modes can exist the observed linewidth of both modes is substantially broadened due to the telegraph switching between the modes . </S>",
    "<S> numetical simulations and an approximate analytical model give good semi - quantitative description of the observed results . </S>"
