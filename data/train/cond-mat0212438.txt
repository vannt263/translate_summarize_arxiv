    "in recent years much attention has been devoted in the field of glass - forming liquids to the so - called energy landscape paradigm .",
    "the main background of this approach is the existence of a strong relation between the topological properties of the potential energy landscape ( i.e.  the potential energy as a function of the system s coordinates ) and the dynamical behaviour of the system .",
    "historically this idea goes back to goldstein @xcite , who , in 1969 , argued how at low enough temperatures supercooled liquids spend a long time in local minima of the potential energy , with rare activated jumps among minima @xcite .",
    "according to goldstein this low-@xmath4 description breaks down at a temperature @xmath0 above which activation is no longer the main mechanism of diffusion .",
    "this temperature @xmath0 has been subsequently identified with the critical temperature where idealized mode coupling theory ( mct ) locates a divergence of the relaxation time @xcite , supporting the view that @xmath0 marks a crossover from a low-@xmath4 activated hopping dynamics , to a continuous flow dynamics at higher @xmath4 , which is well described by mct @xcite .    according to this interpretation , from a topological point of view ,",
    "it is clear that at low temperature the crucial role is played by the minima of the potential energy function , since the system spends most of the time close to them .",
    "this observation can be translated in quantitative terms and various approaches have been elaborated to use information available on the minima and their structure , to compute ( thermo)dynamical quantities @xcite .    on the other hand , above @xmath0",
    "the system is no longer confined around a minimum , but rather flows in configuration space . from a topological point of view",
    "one may imagine that the system explores regions of the configuration space which are rich in negative modes .",
    "a confirmation of this perspective comes from the instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) approach @xcite : the inm spectrum , i.e. the average density of states of the hessian matrix of the potential energy , displays above @xmath0 a finite fraction of imaginary modes , indicating that the system at equilibrium explores regions of the landscape which have negative curvature @xcite .",
    "there have been various attempts to use the inm analysis to identify diffusive modes @xcite , but it still remains unclear under what conditions this can be done , and how far the procedure can be pushed .    from a theoretical point of view , a crucial question is whether also above @xmath0 the behaviour of the system can be characterized by well defined topological entities , as it happens at low temperature with minima .",
    "this point has been addressed in detail in mean - field disordered systems in the context of spin - glasses @xcite , as well as in finite dimensional ordered models @xcite .",
    "given the numerous analogies between the phenomenology of certain spin - glass models and that of structural glasses @xcite , and exploiting the results achieved in that field , a new topological interpretation of the dynamics above @xmath0 has been developed by various authors .",
    "within this scenario , above @xmath0 it is still possible to describe the behaviour of the system in terms of well defined topological entities .",
    "these are not minima , but rather _ saddle points _ of the potential energy function , that is stationary points with a non zero fraction of unstable directions .",
    "more precisely , we can summarize this saddles interpretation in a few main points :    * for @xmath5 at equilibrium the system is close to a saddle point . the typical topological properties of this saddle point , for example its energy @xmath6 and the number of unstable directions @xmath7 , depend on the temperature @xmath4 . * since @xmath8 the system explores a region where negative ( non - confining ) modes are available .",
    "diffusion can then in principle occur in two different ways : either via barrier hopping along the positive eigenvalues , or exploiting the presence of these free directions ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "when @xmath9 is large this second mechanism will be faster than the first one , and will reasonably prevail .",
    "however , upon lowering the temperature @xmath9 decreases and it will become less and less efficient . *",
    "as the temperature approaches @xmath0 the typical saddles become less unstable , and at @xmath0 they finally cease to have negative modes and turn into minima . thus , as @xmath10 the system finds less and less free directions to diffuse and the second mechanism of diffusion previously described will freeze .",
    "if barriers at @xmath0 are relevant , as numerical simulations indicate for fragile systems @xcite , this implies a dramatic increase of the relaxation time and a slowing down of the dynamics as @xmath0 is approached . around @xmath0",
    "a crossover occurs to a different regime where , being negative modes extremely rare , the main mechanism of diffusion becomes barrier crossing and the goldstein scenario is thus recovered @xcite .    this scenario has been tested in different ways and up to now various indications in its favour have been gathered : numerical experiments on glass forming fragile models @xcite have shown that it is possible to identify relevant saddles at a given temperature @xmath4 and classify them through their index @xmath9 . also , and more importantly , @xmath11 as @xmath10 , @xmath0 being the mode coupling temperature .",
    "besides , analytical computations in simple models @xcite show that the system at equilibrium is truly close to a saddle according to a rigorous well defined notion of distance in the configuration space . as in numerical experiments",
    ", the index of the closest saddle goes to zero as the critical temperature is approached .    despite these encouraging results the saddle scenario is not immune of some criticisms .",
    "the results of numerical simulations @xcite highly rely on numerical algorithms to locate the saddles , and the sampling procedure has been deeply questioned ( see for example @xcite ) . also the whole energy landscape approach , even if supported by great part of the community , has recently received many objections ( see for example @xcite where a description of the supercooled behaviour in terms of heterogeneities is preferred ) . besides , the saddle scenario still remains from a theoretical point of view rather vague and incomplete .",
    "in particular , there are several questions which should be addressed , in our opinion , in a more formal and quantitative way :    * from an intuitive point of view and in the light of the numerical results , it is reasonable that saddles do play a crucial role in the dynamical behaviour of the system above @xmath0 . however , is this just a useful qualitative interpretation , or can we push this approach further ?",
    "in other words , is it possible to cast the saddle dynamics into a formal description ? * what is the precise relation between the vanishing of negative modes and the increase of the relaxation time as @xmath10 ?",
    "in particular , what is the link between @xmath9 and the relaxation time @xmath12 ?",
    "* is @xmath9 really the topological quantity most relevant to the dynamics ? * is a saddle description compatible with mode coupling theory ?    in this paper we will address these questions in a formal way by considering a very simple model of harmonic relaxation in a saddle . in our analysis",
    "we only assume as starting hypotheses two facts which have been numerically or analytically tested up to now : 1 ) the system above @xmath0 is close to a saddle point with non zero index @xmath9 , and 2 ) the number of negative modes of this saddle goes to zero as @xmath13 .",
    "the first assumption will enable us to perform an harmonic expansion of the potential energy around a saddle point , while the second will be used as a constraint on the behaviour of the saddle spectrum close to @xmath0 .",
    "our aim is to find an explicit and quantitative link between the topological properties of the energy landscape and the dynamical behaviour of the system .",
    "the input of our model is then the spectrum of the saddle , while our results concern the relation between this spectrum and the relaxation time of the system .",
    "we will leave the shape of this spectrum unspecified as long as we can ( apart from the above - mentioned constraints ) in order to make our statements as general as possible .",
    "only after will we discuss specific cases and their physical relevance .",
    "we will then show how even a simple relaxational dynamics is able to provide precise answers to the previous questions , and in certain cases , even approximately reproduce the results of more complicated dynamical theories such as mode coupling .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our model and the main quantity to be considered , namely the mean square distance ( msd ) ( in configuration space ) of the system from the typical reference saddle point at temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the msd will be expressed in terms of the topological properties of the saddle , more precisely its spectrum . in sec .",
    "iii we use the laplace method to find a relation between the asymptotic dynamical behaviour of the msd and the spectrum of the saddle point . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the consequences of our result , and discuss how the shape of the spectrum may determine qualitatively and quantitatively the long time dynamics .",
    "we look at different classes of spectra and focus on the conditions under which a two - step relaxation with a diverging time - scale is obtained . in sec .",
    "v we compare out results with the prediction of the mode coupling theory .",
    "vi is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a glass forming system with @xmath15 particles and potential energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ( mass - weighted ) vector of the particles positions and @xmath18 is a particle index @xcite . as explained in the introduction , the stationary points of @xmath19 are , from a topological point of view , the quantities of interest to describe the behaviour of the system .",
    "at equilibrium in the low temperature phase @xmath20 , the system ( i.e.its representative point @xmath21 ) explores for most of the time a region close to a minimum of @xmath19 , only occasionally jumping via barrier crossing into the basin of another minimum .",
    "this separation of time scales between intra and inter basin motion has been exploited by both the inm and the inherent structures @xcite approaches to compute dynamic ( velocity autocorrelation ) and thermodynamic quantities ( equilibrium energy , entropy etc . ) via an harmonic expansion of the potential energy around a reference configuration . on the other hand , above @xmath0",
    "the system is typically close to a stationary point which is not a minimum , but a saddle with a certain number of negative modes .",
    "one can wonder whether also in this case it is possible to use this information to simplify the computations with a reasonable approximation , as the harmonic one adopted in the low temperature phase . if the relevant saddles have a large instability index @xmath9 , the system very easily finds escape directions to flow from one region of the phase to another one : even if the closest stationary point will typically be a saddle with the same statistical properties ( index , energy etc . )",
    ", it will not be the _ same _ saddle even for relatively short times .",
    "however , we know from the numerical and analytical works quoted in the introduction , that when @xmath10 , @xmath11 , thus close enough to @xmath0 the relevant saddles have a very small instability index . then , if at some time the system is close to a given saddle it will take a long time before finding one of the few available escape directions and flow away . in this case the system remains close to the _ same _ saddle ( we could say in its basin ) for some time , and an harmonic expansion seems justified , at least on time - scales shorter than the time when the saddle is definitely left .    given that , we shall now consider our system at a temperature @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a small parameter , and assume that at time it is @xmath24 close to a saddle point whose coordinates are @xmath25 in configuration space .",
    "we wish to examine the dynamical behaviour of the system and to do that we resort to a simplified treatment where we use an harmonic expansion of the potential @xmath19 around @xmath25 .",
    "our starting point is then the following langevin equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the displacements from the saddle , the matrix @xmath28 is the second derivative of the potential @xmath19 at the saddle point and @xmath29 is a @xmath30-correlated noise , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this equation has formally a very simple form of the ornstein - ulhenbeck type in @xmath32 dimensions .",
    "of course it is not as trivial as it may seem at a first sight in that the matrix @xmath28 is not known .",
    "this is not only a consequence of having left the potential @xmath19 unspecified , since even when an explicit energy function is assumed , still the exact position @xmath33 of a typical saddle at temperature @xmath4 is not determinable .",
    "this is the glassy nature of the system we are considering : even if the hamiltonian is deterministic , as the temperature is lowered particles tend to arrange in disordered configurations .",
    "thus @xmath28 has rather to be considered a disordered matrix whose distribution is determined in a complicated way by the equilibrium boltzmann measure ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "thus in the following the hessian matrix @xmath34 will be treated as a random variable whose statistical properties are in principle accessible .",
    "in particular , we will express the dynamics in terms of the density of eigenvalues ( spectrum ) of @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the eigenvalues of @xmath28 .",
    "of course , also @xmath37 depends on the precise saddle where it is evaluated , and it is thus a stochastic quantity , as the hessian is . however , its statistical properties are in general more easily computed via numerical simulations @xcite or analytical procedures @xcite and we have more information on its typical behaviour . for example , we know from previous works that the instability degree of a typical saddle decreases as the critical temperature is approached , which means that the spectrum evaluated in a typical saddle has less and less negative modes .",
    "consequently , we will assume that the _ average _ spectrum @xmath38 depends parametrically on @xmath39 , and that its negative support vanishes for @xmath10 , i.e.@xmath40    from eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) we can easily compute the mean square displacement ( msd ) , @xmath41 where we have only assumed that in the thermodynamic limit fluctuations of the spectrum around its average value are negligible ( as indicated by numerical simulations ) , and we have therefore substituted @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "also , we have considered as initial conditions @xmath44 , that is we have assumed the system to start exactly on the top of the saddle . as we shall see , the initial condition is not important as long as the system does not start too far from the saddle ( in sec .",
    "iii we will say exactly how far ) . indeed the additional term arising in equation ( [ d2 ] ) when @xmath45 can be shown in this case to be exponentially small at large times .",
    "this equation is the starting point of our analysis .",
    "all the physics is clearly encoded in the behaviour of the spectrum , both in its shape as a function of @xmath46 and in its dependence on the temperature .",
    "we immediately see that if @xmath43 has some negative support the integral will diverge for @xmath47 , meaning that the system asymptotically leaves the saddle if there are some negative eigenvalues , as expected . as",
    "already said , since we want our harmonic approximation to be reasonable , we are working in the regime @xmath48 , when the support of @xmath43 is almost entirely positive . in this case the systems remains a long time close to the saddle and we can study what happens in the large time limit , but _ before _",
    "the saddle is left .",
    "for mathematical convenience it is better to look at the time derivative of @xmath49 , @xmath50 since the msd is a well defined physical quantity at any given time @xmath51 , this integral should converge for any value of @xmath51 . convergence for @xmath52 requires that @xmath53 if we exclude oscillating functions this implies a concavity condition on @xmath38 ( this is obvious graphically ) : it must exist a @xmath54 such that @xmath55 the support of the spectrum must be entirely positive for @xmath56 , and this implies that @xmath57 for @xmath23 small enough .",
    "we can split the integral in ( [ d2dot ] ) separating the domains @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the maximum of @xmath43 .",
    "as we shall see the remaining part of the integral in @xmath62 is much larger than @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "we can thus disregard @xmath63 and write @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "thus , only the left tail of the spectrum contributes to the behaviour of @xmath62 .    to evaluate this integral in the regime @xmath64",
    "we can use the laplace ( saddle point ) method @xcite to find : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant independent of @xmath51 and @xmath23 , the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath69 is the solution of the saddle point equation @xmath70 , namely @xmath71    from the convergence condition ( [ condo ] ) we see that @xmath72 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath46 , and therefore eq .  ( [ saddle ] ) has a unique solution @xmath69 . besides , we see that @xmath69 changes sign at a well defined time : if we define @xmath73 we have that @xmath74 if we interpret the saddle value @xmath75 as the relevant mode at time @xmath51 , this result translates the intuitive fact that while at short times the system does not realize the presence of escape directions and relaxes in the pseudo - basin around the saddle given by the positive modes , as time increases it finally finds the unstable modes and exploits them to flow away .",
    "this argument already tells us that @xmath3 represents a crucial dynamical time scale in our problem .",
    "this can be appreciated in a more explicit and quantitative way if we analyze in detail the behaviour of @xmath62 .    as we show in appendix a , it is possible to rewrite  ( [ tota ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "this equation shows that the sign of @xmath69 is the key factor determining the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath62 and thus , depending on the value of @xmath51 compared to @xmath1 , we find two time regimes :    * * early time region ( @xmath78 ) : * in this regime @xmath79 and thus @xmath80 is a decreasing function of @xmath51 , reaching its minimum at @xmath81 . from ( [ d2final ] )",
    "we see that @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this means that if the time scale @xmath3 diverges at @xmath0 , then @xmath49 develops a plateau , whose length is of order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath84 at the plateau is given by @xmath85 the demonstration of this expression is sketched in appendix b. physically , it is rather intuitive from eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) if one remembers that at @xmath86 only positive modes contribute , and makes the additional approximation that those with @xmath87 have reached their asymptotic value , while the rest do not contribute at all . since the length of the plateau is proportional to @xmath1 , it is clear that the plateau itself is better defined the closer we are to @xmath0 . note also that for large @xmath1 , the expression for the plateau is just the value of @xmath49 which would be obtained for a strictly positive spectrum by taking the limit @xmath47 in ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "this means that for @xmath88 the system `` thermalizes '' in the saddle using only the positive eigenvalues , and @xmath84 reaches the value it would have reached in a purely harmonic well .",
    "this justifies our initial condition @xmath44 : any other choice with @xmath89 would have been the same .",
    "the average energy density is given by @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 is the bare energy of the saddle .",
    "therefore , at the plateau , that is for @xmath92 , the corrections to the harmonic thermal energy @xmath93 are small if @xmath94 . *",
    "* late time region ( @xmath95 ) : * in this regime we have that @xmath96 .",
    "now the system has finally found the unstable directions and its dynamics is ruled by the escape from the saddle basin .",
    "the integral in the exponential of ( [ d2final ] ) changes sign at a time @xmath12 defined by @xmath97 . besides ,",
    "in appendix c we show that the prefactor in the square root does not go to zero exponentially for @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 for @xmath100 , corresponding to @xmath49 leaving the plateau , i.e.  to the system leaving the saddle .",
    "we could in principle identify @xmath12 as an escape time and consider it as a second relevant dynamical time scale .",
    "however , as we have stressed in the introduction , our harmonic expansion is meaningful as long as the system remains close to the saddle , therefore it is not clear whether @xmath12 has a genuine physical meaning or whether other terms in the potential expansion should already be considered on these time scales .",
    "we stress that these results are valid for a general @xmath101 , with minimal requirements on its behaviour dictated by physical consistency .",
    "to summarize , the most important result is the existence of a relevant time - scale @xmath1 , directly expressed in terms of topological properties of the landscape ( the spectrum at the saddle point ) .",
    "this result answers one of the questions discussed in the introduction , namely the relation between a topology and a relaxation time .",
    "contrarily to the naive expectation , the relaxation time @xmath1 is _ not _ naturally related to the fraction of negative eigenvalues @xmath102 .",
    "rather , if there is a degree of universality in saddle dynamics , the correct scaling variable seems to be @xmath103 ( see ( eq . [ tempo ] ) ) .",
    "a second general result is that the msd exhibits a two step relaxation close to the critical temperature , provided the relevant time scale @xmath3 diverges at @xmath0 .",
    "given the expression of @xmath1 and given that @xmath104 for @xmath105 , it is likely that this is actually the most general scenario for most of reasonable spectra shapes ( even if there are simple counter - examples , as the case @xmath106 ) .    on the other hand , the way the system approaches and leaves the plateau , which is encoded in expression ( [ d2final ] ) , depends on the specific form of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , to extend further our analysis we need at this point to specify the spectrum in some detail .",
    "thus in the next section we shall consider different spectral shapes .",
    "let us now consider some specific forms for the spectrum @xmath107 and compute explicitly the behaviour of @xmath108 .",
    "since we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour we shall specify the spectrum only in the left tail , that is for @xmath109 .",
    "let us consider @xmath110 where @xmath111 in order to ensure a positive definite spectrum at @xmath0 .",
    "this spectrum is of the form @xmath112 and , as noted in the previous section , it has a non - diverging time scale @xmath113 . besides",
    ", from expression ( [ d2 ] ) we see that @xmath108 diverges at a finite time @xmath114 .",
    "equation ( [ d2dot ] ) can be easily integrated and we get @xmath115 therefore in this case we do not get any diverging time scale as a function of @xmath23 nor a two step dynamics .",
    "rather what happens is that @xmath49 diverges at the same time for any temperature above @xmath0 , but in a steeper and steeper way as @xmath0 is approached .",
    "the gaussian tail is less trivial . in this case",
    "we consider @xmath116 with @xmath117 . by applying the laplace method",
    "we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 , \\label{gauss1}\\ ] ] and @xmath122 ( the same expressions can of course be obtained by exactly solving the gaussian integral eq . ( [ d2dot ] ) ) .",
    "therefore for a gaussian tail we get a two - step dynamics with a plateau and a diverging time - scale .",
    "the plateau is approached exponentially , as we see from eq .",
    "( [ gauss2 ] ) .",
    "this is actually the most interesting case , since it gives predictions compatible with mct .",
    "besides , the @xmath123-spin spherical model which has been widely used as a mean - field description of glassy physics and exactly obeys mct equations , has a spectrum belonging to this class ( see sec .",
    "v - c ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath124 with @xmath125 , such that @xmath126 , for @xmath127 . from eq .",
    "( [ saddle ] ) we have @xmath128 , while eq .",
    "( [ d2final ] ) gives @xmath129 by integrating from @xmath1 ( given by ( [ tempo ] ) ) up to @xmath51 , we find , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a scaling function obtained by the expansion of the exponential in ( [ potenza ] ) .",
    "the approach to the plateau can be found by noting that for @xmath132 we have @xmath133 , and thus @xmath134    these three general shapes of the the spectrum give rise to different dynamical behaviours . in particular ,",
    "only a power spectrum gives rise to a diverging time - scale _ and _ a power - law approach to the plateau .",
    "this fact is particularly important when comparing the predictions of this simple model with those of the mct , as we shall do in the next section .",
    "to conclude , we note that a useful quantity to characterize the approach to the plateau is the time - dependent effective exponent @xcite , @xmath135 if in some time regime the msd has a power law dependence on time , @xmath136 , this must show up as a constant contribution to the effective exponent in some extended region of time , that is @xmath137 .",
    "if we apply this definition to the previous cases , we see easily that the only one exhibiting a constant region for @xmath138 is the third one ( see fig .  1 ) , for which find @xmath139 .     and @xmath140 , for @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "dotted lines indicate the plateau of @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ plato ] ) , and plateau of @xmath143.,width=4 ]",
    "mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite is a dynamical approach which has been widely tested on a great range of glass forming systems . it is not an exact theory , in that it makes some assumptions on the memory functions entering the exact dynamical equations , but it deals with the complete dynamics of the system and takes into account in detail its structural properties . for structural fragile glasses it is now commonly accepted that mct represents an excellent description of the supercooled liquid system for @xmath144 ( see for ex .",
    "@xcite ) .    our single saddle model is , on the other hand , a much more simplified approach and we can not expect it to reproduce the whole set of mct results .",
    "however , if we believe that close to @xmath0 the main mechanism driving the dynamical slowing down is the vanishing of the negative modes available to the system , our model should describe reasonably the behaviour of the system in this temperature range and should therefore reproduce at least the main mct predictions .",
    "the mct predicts the existence of a critical temperature @xmath0 where the relaxation time of the system diverges . in real systems a real dynamical transition is not observed , however @xmath0 still represents a well defined relevant temperature where a slowing down of the dynamics takes place and a clear crossover to a different dynamical regime arrives .    a general prediction of mct is the presence , as @xmath4 approaches @xmath0 from above , of a two - step relaxation of the relevant dynamical quantities , such as , for example correlation , response functions and the msd .",
    "more than this , mct provides with detailed predictions about the approach and escape from the plateau and the final relaxation to the equilibrium asymptotic value .",
    "it distinguishes two dynamical regimes , both of which become critical at the transition : the so - called @xmath2-relaxation regime , which concerns the dynamics around the plateau , and the @xmath145-relaxation regime , which is related to structural relaxation to the ergodic values . here",
    ", we will be concerned with the @xmath2 relaxation , since , as already underlined , our model is a reasonable approximation only until when the plateau is left .    according to mct , in the @xmath2-relaxation regime the correlation function @xmath146 has the following scaling form ( as usual @xmath147 ) , @xmath148 the correlation function has a plateau @xmath149 of length @xmath1 , and @xmath1 diverges as a power law for @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , mct predicts a power law approach to the plateau ( early @xmath2 regime ) , that is , @xmath150 whereas for times larger than @xmath1 the correlation function leaves the plateau as ( late @xmath2 regime ) @xmath151 where @xmath152 , and @xmath12 is the @xmath145-relaxation time .    for the supercooled system studied in @xcite",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath153 is @xmath154 .      among the spectral shapes we have considered",
    ", only the power case gives a scaling compatible with mct .",
    "looking at equations  ( [ superpotenza ] ) and  ( [ lord ] ) , we conclude that the dynamical scaling of mct is reproduced by spectra of the form @xmath155 the predicted dynamical exponent being @xmath156 .",
    "equation ( [ pow2 ] ) , also implies a simple condition on the behaviour of the spectrum in @xmath157 : only spectra that behave as @xmath158 are compatible with mct .",
    "this seems to be a quite strong topological requirement , very easy to check in specific cases .",
    "finally , we note that the important point is that the power law behaviour is obeyed in the main range of the negative support as @xmath0 is approached .",
    "the presence of small correcting tails around the lower band edge @xmath159 is not important if they arise in a vanishing ( as @xmath160 ) region .",
    "indeed , let us imagine that the power law behaviour ( [ pow2 ] ) holds down to a certain value @xmath161 .",
    "it is simple to show that the dynamical behaviour predicted by a power law spectrum still holds up to time - scales @xmath162 with @xmath163 , while for greater times the tail effect starts dominating . therefore if @xmath164 vanishes as @xmath165 , the dynamical scaling still holds in a diverging time window . in finite dimensional systems",
    "one usually gets small tails in the spectrum where localized modes are concentrated .",
    "the previous observation suggests that for a supercooled liquid , where we may expect small tails to smoothen the spectrum close to the lower band edge , only the extended modes representing the main negative support are truly relevant for diffusion .      to perform a real comparison between mct and our simplified harmonic model",
    "we need to consider specific cases .",
    "in particular , an excellent test would be a system where both approaches can be fully applied .",
    "that is , we need a model where i ) the mct dynamical phenomenology is reproduced and ii ) information on the local topology is analytically available .    the @xmath123-spin spherical model ( psm ) @xcite satisfies both these requirements .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the _ exact _ dynamical equations for this model have a mct structure @xcite , that is for the psm the mct is _ exact _ ( contrarily to structural glasses where it represents an approximation ) . besides , for this model saddles have been shown analytically to play a relevant role @xcite and the spectrum of a typical saddle at temperature @xmath166 is exactly known @xcite .",
    "its left tail is @xmath167 since in the psm @xmath168 $ ] , the mct scaling forms of eqs .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , ( [ in ] ) and  ( [ out ] ) directly apply also to the mean - square displacement .",
    "the exact resolution of the dynamical mct equations for @xmath146 can be found in @xcite and gives @xmath169 .    on the other hand",
    "the behaviour predicted by our harmonic model can be simply inferred by the results of the previous sub - section with @xmath140 and @xmath170 .",
    "we get @xmath171 and a power law approach to the plateau : @xmath172 this behaviour is consistent with a mct scaling form with an exponent @xmath173 , to be compared with the exact value @xmath174 .",
    "our conclusion is then that for the psm the single saddle model correctly reproduces the general dynamical scaling of the complete mct dynamics and the power law approach to the plateau of the early @xmath2 regime .",
    "the power law approach to the plateau can also be seen by setting @xmath175 in the effective exponent .",
    "this gives , @xmath176 .",
    "from this expression we see that for @xmath177 the model gives no power law departure from the plateau ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "this must not be regarded as significant since the model itself looses validity at large times ( for this reason we have only focused on the early @xmath2 regime ) .",
    "unfortunately , our model does not exactly reproduce the exponent @xmath153 ( or , in other terms , it does not give the correct form of the scaling function @xmath178 ( [ scaling ] ) , which is responsible for the value of the exponent @xmath153 ) .",
    "of course , this leaves us partly unsatisfied .",
    "however , it is known that anharmonicities are very strong in the psm , and it is reasonable that they are already relevant close to the saddle .",
    "if this is the case one should be able to show that taking into account anharmonicities , for example via a perturbative approach , modifies the exponent in the correct direction .",
    "we are now working in this direction .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a simple model of relaxational dynamics around an harmonic saddle .",
    "the physical problem we wanted to address was the description of supercooled liquids close to the crossover temperature @xmath0 , and our main purpose was to model in a formal way the connection between topological properties of the potential energy and dynamical behaviour which is at the basis of the energy landscape approach .    despite the extreme simplicity of our model and the generality of our assumptions our results are not trivial .",
    "we have obtained a general expression which relates the spectrum of the saddle and a relevant time - scale , and we have outlined the conditions under which such a time - scale diverges giving rise to a two - step dynamics with a well defined plateau at @xmath0 .",
    "this time - scale is related to unstable modes , however it is not proportional to the instability index , as naive expectation would have suggested .",
    "rather , it is related to the behaviour of the spectrum close to zero : since negative modes tend to disappear as @xmath0 is approached it is the way they turn into soft modes that determines the long time dynamics .",
    "the precise way the system relaxes to the plateau depends on the shape of the saddle spectrum .",
    "we have analyzed different spectral shapes and we have shown that power law spectra give rise to the same dynamical scaling as the one predicted by mct in the @xmath2-regime . for this kind of spectra",
    "then our model seems to be consistent with mct .    beside these general qualitative predictions",
    "we have also looked at the specific case of the @xmath123-spherical model , where both the spectrum and the dynamics can be analytically computed .",
    "here the saddle model reproduces the dynamical scaling predicted by the mct , which is in this case exact .",
    "the @xmath123-spin spherical model is interesting because it represents a concrete model where the two approaches , mct and single - saddle relaxation , can be independently performed and ultimately compared .",
    "our analysis indicates that , despite its brutal disregarding of anharmonic contributions , the single saddle model already reproduces the main features of the complete exact dynamics , namely the dynamical scaling and power law approach to the plateau .",
    "our interpretation of this result has been sketched in the introduction : the presence of the plateau and the slowing down of the dynamics described by the mct equations are mainly due to the vanishing of the negative modes close to the transition temperature @xmath0 , and these effects are already taken into account at the harmonic level in the single saddle model . in the psm",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated this , however we expect the same to hold whenever mct is a good description of the problem , as for structural fragile glasses . to support this conclusion we should in principle",
    "proceed as we did for the psm : compute the dynamical quantities using the single saddle model and compare them with the mct predictions .",
    "the problem is that , contrarily to the @xmath123-spin case , the spectrum of a typical saddle is not in general known for models of glass forming systems .",
    "we may expect that numerical simulations or analytic computations will provide this topological information and our analysis be completed in the future . on the other hand , there is something important we have already done at this stage : we have outlined under what general conditions for @xmath107 our single saddle model is compatible with the mct predictions . if the spectra of real glass systems will turn out to satisfy these conditions we will then have very strong support for our arguments .",
    "we acknowledge rewarding discussions with s.  ciliberti , g.  parisi , f.  ricci - tersenghi and p. verrocchio .",
    "here we show how to derive expression ( [ d2final ] ) for the msd . for convenience",
    "we omit in the following the sub - index @xmath23 .",
    "we remind that the dot indicates a derivative with respect to time , while the prime a derivative with respect to @xmath179 .",
    "let us call @xmath180 . by deriving @xmath181 with respect to time the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ tota ] ) and using the saddle point equation ( [ saddle ] ) we obtain @xmath182 and thus @xmath183 for what concerns the denominator of ( [ tota ] ) we have to evaluate @xmath184 where we have used again the saddle point equation .",
    "we define @xmath185 .",
    "derivatives of @xmath186 with respect to time give @xmath187 putting together these relations we have @xmath188 so finally eq.([tota ] ) becomes @xmath189 where we have fixed @xmath190 for convenience , and @xmath191 .",
    "we recall that this formula is valid for @xmath64 , and on the assumption that the integral for @xmath192 is sub - dominant .",
    "we can see from ( [ d2 ] ) that this is actually true .",
    "indeed , since the saddle point solution @xmath193 is a decreasing function of time , it will surely become smaller that @xmath194 , for @xmath51 large enough , therefore @xmath195 at large times and @xmath196 is exponentially sub - dominant with respect to ( [ d2app ] ) .",
    "we now want to determine the value of the plateau .",
    "first , we need to appropriately define what we mean with plateau .",
    "we have seen that @xmath197 has a minimum for @xmath198 .",
    "this means that @xmath199 is as close as possible to the limiting value where @xmath108 would go if there were no negative eigenvalues .",
    "thus , we may define an effective plateau for @xmath200 ( but very small ) as @xmath201 in this way for @xmath105 @xmath202 approaches a well defined value @xmath203 related to relaxation in a harmonic well .",
    "we now show that @xmath204 + { \\rm o}[\\rho(-1/t_\\epsilon ) ] , \\label{platfin}\\ ] ] and thus @xmath205 as expected . to prove ( [ platfin ] ) we proceed as follows .",
    "we split @xmath108 into different parts @xmath206 and we evaluate the different integrals . by using the saddle point method for @xmath207",
    "we find @xmath208 c is easy : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a constant prefactor . to evaluate d",
    "we note that to ensure the convergence of @xmath108 the function @xmath211 should go to zero for @xmath212",
    ". we can thus estimate d with the saddle point method : @xmath213 the integral e is trickier .",
    "once again we use the saddle point method .",
    "the procedure is the same as the one used for @xmath214 .",
    "since the factor @xmath215 is algebraic it can be discarded in the evaluation of the maximum so that the maximum of the integrand still occurs for a value @xmath216 as given by equation ( [ saddle ] ) .",
    "but , by definition , @xmath217 .",
    "so for @xmath51 close enough to @xmath218 the real maximum lies outside the integration range and the integral is dominated by the upper integration limit .",
    "thus we have @xmath219 finally , exactly as for c we have @xmath220",
    "we now argue that the prefactor of the square root of eq .",
    "( [ d2final ] ) does not go to zero exponentially for @xmath47 , at least for physical spectra shapes .",
    "let us suppose that for @xmath98 we have @xmath221 this implies that @xmath222 that is , if we define @xmath223 , @xmath224 with @xmath225 .",
    "this is what happens when @xmath226 has a cut in the left tail ( semicircle ) .",
    "condition ( [ ass ] ) implies ( we integrate between @xmath51 and @xmath227 ) @xmath228 given that @xmath229 is a decreasing function of @xmath179 , using the saddle point equation we find @xmath230 calling @xmath231 , and for @xmath232 , this relation gives @xmath233 if we now recall that @xmath234 , and we integrate between @xmath179 and @xmath235 and take the limit @xmath236 , we find @xmath237 thus , if equation  ( [ ass ] ) holds , the spectrum must be nonzero at the left cut ( the converse is not true ) . therefore , if we discard this unphysical case , we are sure that for @xmath47 the gaussian fluctuations do not go to zero exponentially .",
    "it is possible that for spectra of the kind we exclude , the exponential factor increases faster than a simple exponential and therefore still kills the prefactor contribution , but we have not been able to prove under what conditions this happens .",

    "in fact , the effective exponent in the psm shows that even for @xmath244 there is no extended time region where @xmath245 ( fig.6 of @xcite ) , and thus the departure from the plateau is not really power law in the psm ."
