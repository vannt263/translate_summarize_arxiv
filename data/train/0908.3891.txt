    "determining how and when the universe was reionized is one of the major outstanding questions of modern cosmology .",

    "observations of absorption spectra of quasars at redshifts @xmath5 indicate that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is largely ionized .",
    "therefore a cosmic phase transition occurred whereby the igm went from being fully neutral to being almost fully ionized ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "our picture of when exactly this phase transition occurred and what was the nature of the sources that drove it remains cloudy .    in recent years , improved observational data has begun to probe the reionization era . by pursuing observations of the ly@xmath0 forest in qso spectra at ever higher redshifts , gunn - peterson troughs @xcite",
    "have been seen along several quasar sight lines at @xmath6 @xcite , providing an indication of an increase in the igm neutral fraction at these redshifts .",
    "interpretation of these observations is subtle , since the igm ionization state depends upon its thermal history , the spectrum of the ionizing sources , and the history of the production of ionizing radiation in those sources .",
    "complementing ly@xmath0 forest observations , is the detection of the imprint of reionization in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "rescattering of cmb photons by the ionized igm produces a distinctive  bump \" in the cmb power spectrum on large angular scales that has been detected by wmap @xcite .",
    "this places a constraint on the integrated optical depth @xmath7 to the surface of last scattering , and suggests that a significant fraction of the igm was ionized by @xmath8 . in a few years time , results from the planck satellite are expected to tighten these constraints considerably .",
    "in addition to these relatively robust observations , a host of other observations contribute to our understanding of the state of the igm at high redshift .",
    "these include constraints on the temperature of the igm in the range @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these observations are challenging and their interpretation is complicated by the likelihood that heii reionization is occurring at @xmath10 .",
    "other observations include the evolution of the abundance and clustering of ly@xmath0 emitters @xcite and of the evolution of the metallicity @xcite .",
    "these observations are difficult to interpret and as of yet offer only hints rather than definite evidence for how reionization proceeds",
    ". there also exist constraints on the number density of galaxies at high redshift @xcite , although extrapolating from the few galaxies observed to their implications on the ionization history is difficult due to the small number of candidate high redshift galaxies and the unknown escape fraction of ionizing photons .    in the near future",

    "for example , @xcite attempt to simultaneously model many of the above observations with a single model in a self - consistent way . despite progress ,",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the theoretical modelling of reionization , partly stemming from uncertainty in the relevant parameters and partly from the complexity of the interaction between different physical processes .    in this paper , we combine these different pieces of observational evidence in order to quantify our uncertainty on the reionization history . given the numerous sources of astrophysical uncertainty , we argue that it is presumptive to claim that we can use analytic models to definitively constrain reionization in detail ( e.g. choudhury & ferrara  2005 ) .",
    "instead we propose arbitrary forms for the evolution of ionizing photon production .",
    "using these arbitrary forms , we define the space of plausible models that fit the current data .",
    "we focus on the ly@xmath0 forest and cmb observations which most tightly constrain reionization , and which are most readily predicted by an analytic model .",
    "we use a likelihood based analysis to place constraints on the ionization history , considering two different source modelling parametrizations , in order to assess the systematic uncertainty in our conclusions .",
    "having made explicit the bounds of our ignorance in the ionization history , we explore the implications for the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) that future 21 cm experiments might achieve at different redshifts . finally , we turn this problem around and ask what 21 cm experiments will tell us about the reionization history that was not already implicit in our existing observations .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : observations ] we discuss the current observational constraints on reionization that we will be using in our analysis .",
    "we then discuss in  [ sec : inference ] the formalism for using these constraints to infer the ionization history given a particular model for reionization . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we use this formalism to place constraints on model parameters and calculate probability distributions for the neutral fraction in different redshift bins .",

    "we now turn to the existing observational constraints on reionization .",
    "constraints on reionization fall into two main types : those , like @xmath7 , that depend solely upon the ionization history @xmath21 and those , like the ly@xmath0 forest , that constrain the sources and ionizing background that drives reionization . in this section ,",

    "this leaves about half of the observed optical depth @xmath29 to be explained by ionization at higher redshifts .    in the instantaneous model used by the wmap5 analysis @xcite , the observed @xmath7 corresponds to a reionization redshift of @xmath30 . for more extended models of reionization , such as those of @xcite , full",
    "reionization occurs later , but with a significant tail to higher redshifts .",
    "since @xmath7 is an integral over the ionization history , the optical depth constraint essentially gives us a constraint on the duration of reionization or equivalently the redshift at which star formation began . with much better data , one could imagine finding inconsistencies between @xmath7 and direct measurements of the reionization history indicating that other processes were responsible for modifying the ionization history at high redshift @xcite . in this paper , we assume that all of @xmath7 arises from reionization by astrophysical sources and use the reported wmap5 @xmath7 value .    in principle ,",
    "cmb observations are sensitive to more than just @xmath7 since the shape of the reionization history will modify the polarization angular power spectrum on angular scales @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , realistic reionization histories lead to only small modifications that are hard to detect with even cosmic variance limited observations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that cmb missions will provide much information on reionization beyond that contained in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "turning now to astrophysical constraints , we begin with observations of the ly@xmath0 forest in quasar absorption spectra . these place constraints on the ionizing background produced by luminous sources .",
    "the measured quantity is the mean transmittance of ly@xmath0 flux @xmath32 along the line of site to a quasar or equivalently the effective optical depth @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "with knowledge of the physical properties of the igm , @xmath34 can be connected to the background photoionization rate per hydrogen atom @xmath35 .",
    "this quantity serves as a constraint on the sources of ionizing radiation that drive reionization .",
    "however , the conversion of a measured value of @xmath34 into @xmath36 is a non - trivial process requiring the use of hydro - dynamical simulations of the igm @xcite or the use of the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( fgpa ) @xcite .",
    "it is further plagued by our poor understanding of the relationship between overdensity @xmath37 and temperature @xmath38 in the igm .",
    "this is traditionally modelled at a power law @xmath39 , the asymptotic form after reionization has taken place @xcite .",
    "however , recent simulations have shown that the situation at @xmath40 may be significantly more complicated as a result of heii reionization @xcite with there being some evidence for a temperature inversion . at @xmath41 , there are currently no direct measurements of this relation @xcite .    since @xmath42 is a mostly local measurement , it primarily constrains the sources at the redshift at which it is measured . in this paper",
    ", we assume that our model of sources should consistently drive reionization and also match observations shortly after reionization has completed @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember that ionizing photons may come from quasars in addition to stars .",
    "@xcite show that , whereas the contribution from quasars drops rapidly at redshift @xmath41 @xcite , the contribution from galaxies remains fairly constant , suggesting that galaxies are the dominant source of ionizing photons during reionization .",

    "unfortunately , this is at the edge of observational capability .",
    "improving these observations would go a long way towards constraining the evolution of the sources .",
    "note that the @xmath44 constraints at @xmath45 and @xmath46 are essentially identical .",
    "this is an indication that the errors from parameters other than @xmath36 dominate the error budget .",
    "note that our constraints on @xmath36 are somewhat different from those of and since these are very sensitive to the temperature prior used .",
    "the overall normalization of the temperature is less important for the @xmath44 constraints since shifting the temperature changes the normalisation of @xmath36 , but the scaling of @xmath47 is such as to compensate in the calculation of @xmath44 ( see equation ) .",
    "we next discuss our parametrization of the sources and consider two cases to explore the model dependence of our predictions . since we are focussed on behaviour at @xmath41 , we neglect the known contribution of quasars , which is expected to be small at these redshifts .",
    "the arbitrary nature of our parametrization of @xmath44 implicitly allows for a variety of contributing sources especially galaxies and quasars , but could also include x - ray ionizations from early mini - quasars @xcite provided that these were unimportant for the ly@xmath0 forest .    the quantity @xmath44 is affected by two ingredients : the star formation rate and the number of ionizing photons per baryon in stars that escapes to ionize in the igm .",
    "this motivates separating the two parts using the assumption that the star formation rate simply tracks the rate at which collapsed structures form .",
    "this leads to @xmath48 where we have factored out the unknown number of ionizing photons per baryon , escape fraction , and star forming efficiency into a single ionizing efficiency @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate @xmath50 assuming a press - schecter mass function @xcite and using the minimum galaxy mass from atomic hydrogen line cooling . rather than attempt to model @xmath44 directly",
    ", we can then model @xmath51 instead .",
    "this has the advantage of separating out the expected rapid increase in the star formation rate , which results from the exponential increase of the collapse fraction .",

    "in order to satisfy the @xmath7 constraint however a population of more efficient sources at higher redshifts is required . this could arise , for example , from evolution in the escape fraction with redshift or from the contribution of a different population of sources at high redshift e.g. population iii stars .",

    "this clearly indicates that there is a good chance of mwa detecting the 21 cm signal over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "experiments sensitive to the global 21 cm signal will be most sensitive to sharp features in @xmath21 where the derivative of @xmath103 is large , since smooth modes are removed with the foregrounds . converting the reionization history into the expected signal",

    "]    since 21 cm observations are able to measure the ionization fraction @xmath12 during the central parts of reionization ( lidz et al .  2007 ) , it is interesting to ask how such a measurement would aid our knowledge of reionization during other stages of the process .      in figure",

    "clearly , the distributions are not competitive with the wmap5 constraint unless the source evolution is quite constrained .",
    "nonetheless constraints on @xmath7 from the directly measured ionization history may provide a useful consistency check with the results from cmb experiments .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a framework for combining existing constraints on reionization from cmb and ly@xmath0 forest observations , and used them to place bounds on the reionization history .",
    "modeling of reionization is very uncertain , both in terms of the sources of radiation ( their evolution , spectrum , clustering , etc . ) , and in terms of their interaction with the neutral igm . rather than employ a semi - analytic model , with all the necessary assumptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have therefore chosen a more general approach which utilises arbitrary forms for the evolution of ionizing emissivity .",
    "this approach avoids theoretical prejudice regarding the model for reionization at the greatest possible level .",
    "the framework that we have used here can easily be extended to incorporate more general parametrizations of the sources as improved data makes that worthwhile .    the resulting analytic model for reionization and the ly@xmath0 forest",
    "is described in appendix [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "this approach remains model dependent .",
    "however the level of dependance has been quantified by considering two different parametrizations for the sources .",
    "these give consistent predictions on @xmath21 , albeit with differing levels of precision .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to draw some relatively robust conclusions from our analysis .",
    "the main conclusion is that current observations suggest reionization was largely complete by @xmath1 with the universe likely to have been half ionized between @xmath2 .",
    "this result has important implications for upcoming 21 cm experiments .",
    "in particular we have shown that the signal - to - noise ratio for these experiments is most likely to be at its maximum in the range @xmath2 .",
    "thus current observables of reionization can be used to guide the first attempts at 21 cm observations , which will be very expensive in terms of observing time , and cover only a fraction of the reionization era at a time .",
    "we also demonstrate that following a 21 cm derived measurement of the ionization fraction midway through the reionization era , the constraints on the entire history will be greatly enhanced .",
    "finally , we speculate that future 21 cm experiments might begin to constrain @xmath7 sufficiently to provide an independent consistency check on cmb results .",
