    "with the existence of a magnetic field connecting a kerr black hole ( bh ) to its surrounding disc , energy and angular momentum can be transferred from the bh to the disc ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000 ; li 2002a , hereafter li02a ; wang , xiao & lei 2002 , hereafter wxl ) , which can be regarded as one of the variants of the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process proposed two decades ago ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "henceforth this energy mechanism is referred to as the magnetic coupling ( mc ) process .",
    "recently wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 reveals an extremely broad and redshifted @xmath0 line indicating its origin from the very most central region of the accretion disc , and they suggested that the rotating energy of a bh is extracted by the magnetic field connecting the bh or plunging region to the disc .",
    "later li pointed out that the magnetic coupling of a spinning bh with a disc can produce a very steep emissivity with index @xmath1 , which is consistent with the above _ xmm - newton _ observation ( li 2002b , hereafter li02b ) .",
    "this result can be regarded as the observation signatures of the existence of the mc process .",
    "very recently we obtained the same result in a more detailed mc model , which is consistent with the _ xmm - newton _ observation with reference to a variety of parameters of the bh - disc system ( wang , lei & ma 2003 , hereafter wlm ) .",
    "another relevance of mc model to the observation is kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpo ) in x - ray binaries . as argued by van der klis ( 2000 ) , khz qpos in x - ray binaries",
    "probably originate from the inner edge of an accretion disc with a bh of stellar - mass , since millisecond is the natural timescale for accretion process in these regions .",
    "recently li suggested that the non - axisymmetric mc of a spinning bh of stellar - mass with a disc might be used to explain the khz qpos ( li 2001 , hereafter li01 ) .",
    "motivated by li s suggestion we propose an analytic model of a rotating hot spot to explain the khz qpos , where the hot spot arises from the energy transferred to the inner region of the relativistic disc by the closed field lines of a non - axisymmetric magnetic field on the bh horizon .",
    "six parameters are involved in our model . among them",
    "three are used to describe the strength and azimuthal angular region of the bulging magnetic field on the bh horizon , another two are used to describe mass and spin of the kerr bh , and one is the power - law index of the magnetic field varying with the radial coordinate on the disc . we give a detailed discussion on a rotating hot spot for fitting khz qpos in terms of these parameters .",
    "( a )        ( b )    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show that the position of a hot spot is determined by non - axisymmetric magnetic field with a mapping relation between the poloidal angular coordinate on the horizon and the radial coordinate on the disc .",
    "it turns out that the hot spot is limited very close to the inner edge of the disc for the appropriate values of the bh spin and the power - law index of the magnetic field on the disc . in section 3",
    "we prove that the hot spot can reach the energy level of emitting x - ray , provided that the bulging magnetic field on the horizon is strong enough to reach @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore the rotating frequency of a hot spot is expressed in terms of keplerian angular velocity at the place where @xmath3 is maximized , where @xmath4 is the sum of radiation flux due to disc accretion and that arising from the mc between the spinning bh and the disc . in section 4",
    "we fit khz qpo widths by assuming the fluctuation of the bulging magnetic field on the horizon .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we give a summary for our model .    throughout this paper the geometric units",
    "@xmath5 are used .",
    "in order to facilitate the discussion of the rotating hot spot we make the following assumptions .",
    "\\(i ) the magnetic field is assumed to connect the bh with the surrounding disc as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the radii @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radii of inner and outer boundaries of the mc region , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the corresponding poloidal angular coordinates on the horizon .",
    "\\(ii ) the toroidal profile of the magnetic field is non - axisymmetric on the bh horizon , being expressed by a function @xmath10 of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath11 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to vary in a power - law as the radial coordinate of the disc as suggested by blandford ( 1976 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the disc is both stable and perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc .",
    "\\(iv ) the disc is thin and keplerian , locating in the equatorial plane of the bh with the inner boundary at the last stable circular orbit .    generally speaking ,",
    "the magnetic field on the horizon is non - axisymmetric .",
    "unfortunately , a reliable profile of the magnetic field on the horizon has not been given due to lack of knowledge about it .",
    "as a simple analysis we assume the profile function @xmath10 as shown in fig.2(a ) , which is expressed by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is root - mean - square of the magnetic field over the poloidal angular coordinate from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . as shown in fig.2(a ) , the parameter @xmath14 is used to describe the strength of the bulging magnetic field in the region @xmath15 , which is the azimuthal angular range of the hot spot on the disc .",
    "the drawback of the pattern given in fig.2(a ) lies in the uncontinuity of the magnetic field at @xmath16 and@xmath17 .",
    "in fact , function @xmath10 can be modified by a smooth joint - function as shown in fig.2(b ) , and we shall modify the model of rotating hot spot by using a more realistic profile function in future .",
    "the radial range of the hot spot is determined by a mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disc as follows :    @xmath18    where    @xmath19         ( a)(b)(c )    the angle @xmath20 is assumed in derivation .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) associated with equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is the revised version of the mapping relation derived in wxl .",
    "parameter @xmath21 is a dimensionless radius of the disc in terms of the radius of the last stable circular orbit , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is dimensionless parameter of the bh spin defined by the bh mass @xmath24 and angular momentum @xmath25 .",
    "following blandford ( 1976 ) the normal components of magnetic field , @xmath26 , on the disc is assumed to vary with @xmath27 as follows .",
    "@xmath28    in deriving equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) the boundary condition is used as given in wlm , i.e.    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the normal component of magnetic field at horizon , and @xmath31 is the cylindrical radius at @xmath32 ,    @xmath33    equation ( [ eq5 ] ) implies the conservation of magnetic flux corresponding to the two loops of the same width , and the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath34 varies from 1.8 to 3 for @xmath35 . considering that the strength of the magnetic field at the horizon is likely greater than that in the disc by numerical simulation ( ghosh & abramowicz 1997 and the references therein )",
    ", we think that the relation ( [ eq5 ] ) is more reasonable than the boundary condition @xmath36 given in wxl .    substituting @xmath37 and @xmath38 into equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    ", we obtain an integral equation for determining the outer boundary @xmath39 of the mc region as follows :    @xmath40    from equation ( [ eq7 ] ) we find that @xmath41 behaves as a non - monotonic function of @xmath42 for different values of @xmath43 and @xmath8 as shown in fig.3 .    in wlm the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum between a rotating bh and its surrounding disc is discussed in detail by using the co - rotation radius @xmath44 , which is defined as the radius where the angular velocity @xmath45 of the disc is equal to the bh angular velocity @xmath46 .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 is a function of @xmath48 determined by the following equation ,    @xmath49^ { - 1 } = 1,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath50    in equation ( [ eq9 ] ) @xmath51 is a dimensionless radial parameter on the disc , and @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 .",
    "the mc region is divided by @xmath44 into two parts : the inner mc region ( henceforth imcr ) for @xmath54 and the outer mc region ( henceforth omcr ) for @xmath55 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 decreasing monotonically with @xmath48 is shown by the dot - dashed line in fig.3 , and the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum is described as follows .",
    "\\(i ) for @xmath57 the transfer direction is from the bh to the disc with @xmath58 .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath59 the transfer direction is from the disc to the bh with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the bh spin corresponding to the intersection of the curve @xmath62 with the curve @xmath63 as shown in fig.3 .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath64 the transfer direction is from the bh to omcr with @xmath55 , while it is from imcr to the bh with @xmath54 .",
    "since a hot spot is produced by the energy transferred from the bh to the disc , its radial range is expressed by    @xmath65    from fig.3 we find that the outer boundary @xmath66 is very close to @xmath67 in both case @xmath68 and case _ ii _ , provided that the power - law index @xmath43 is small , such as @xmath69 .",
    "this result seems insensitive to the values of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the hot spot is confined to a small radial region very near to the inner edge of the disc .",
    "based on conservation of energy and angular momentum the basic equations for bh evolution in the coexistence of disc accretion and the mc process are written as    @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are mc power and torque in the mc process , respectively . in wxl",
    "we derived @xmath72 and @xmath73 for axisymmetric magnetic field , by using an improved equivalent circuit as follows :    @xmath74    @xmath75    equations ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) can be extended to the case for non - axisymmetric magnetic field as follows :    @xmath76    @xmath77    where the superscripts ` _ _ axis _ _ ' and ` _ _ naxis _ _ ' indicate the quantities for axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 is expressed by    @xmath79 ^ 2 = \\left ( { 1 + \\delta \\varepsilon } \\right)^2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 is a parameter indicating the azimuthal region of the bulging magnetic field on the horizon expressed by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) can be derived in the same way as in wxl , provided that the magnetic flux between two adjacent magnetic surfaces @xmath81 is replaced by    @xmath82\\delta l \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\quad\\quad= \\sqrt { \\left\\langle { b_h^2 } \\right\\rangle } 2\\pi \\varpi \\left ( { 1 + \\delta \\varepsilon } \\right)^2\\delta l , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where equation ( [ eq18 ] ) is given for the bulging magnetic field expressed by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "obviously , equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) reduce to axisymmetric ones for either @xmath83 or @xmath84 with @xmath85 , and they also become axisymmetric ones for @xmath86 with @xmath87 . based on equations ( [ eq13])([eq16 ] )",
    "we can express the rate of extracting energy and angular momentum from the bh to the hot spot as follows :    @xmath88    @xmath89    from equations ( [ eq15 ] ) , ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) we find that the ratio of @xmath90 to @xmath91 is the same as that of @xmath92 to @xmath93 , i.e.    @xmath94    where the ratio @xmath95 is used to express the fractional energy and angular momentum attributable to the hot spot in the mc process .",
    "the curves of @xmath95 varying with the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath96 are shown in fig.4 .    from fig.4",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath97 is independent of the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath48 and @xmath43 , and it increases almost linearly with the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath96 .",
    "for an appropriate angular region of the bulging magnetic field on the horizon , such as @xmath98 , we have the ratio varying from 0.1 to 0.18 for a small value range of the strength of the bulging magnetic field , * * @xmath99**. * * these results show that the effects of the bulging magnetic field on the energy and angular momentum transferred to the hot spot are significant .

    "so we can define its effective radiation temperature @xmath106 as a blackbody spectrum :    @xmath107^{1 \\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { 1 4 } } \\right .",
