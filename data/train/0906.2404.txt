    "groups of galaxies are repositories for a substantial fraction of all baryons and metals at low redshift .",
    "being much more numerous than more massive clusters and more susceptible to the effects of non - gravitational processes such as galaxy winds driven by supernovae or active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they represent unique laboratories for the study of galactic feedback and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium . in practice",
    ", this can be exploited through x - ray observations of the hot intragroup gas , which allow the abundance of several heavy elements in this gas to be constrained .",
    "numerous such studies have been undertaken for massive galaxy clusters , providing a reasonably well - constrained picture of the amount and distribution of metals in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and in the cluster galaxies themselves @xcite . however , despite extensive observational and theoretical efforts , several important questions related to icm enrichment still remain , such as the relative importance of the mechanisms responsible for transferring metals from galaxies to the icm , and the role of mergers and galactic wind activity in redistributing enriched material .",
    "for example , it has been notoriously difficult to reproduce observed icm metal distributions in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of clusters , suggesting that important processes affecting baryons in these systems may still be inadequately captured or altogether missing in such models ( see , e.g. , review by @xcite ) .",
    "characterization of the chemical makeup of the hot gas in more numerous lower - mass groups could provide an important ingredient in resolving these questions . due to the structural role played by groups in connecting the ` field '  i.e.isolated galaxies and the intergalactic medium",
    " with the rare high - density peaks represented by massive clusters , a clearer picture of enrichment in groups may have ramifications for our understanding of the evolution of baryons across a wide range of environments .    in an early study of the distribution of elemental abundances in intragroup gas , @xcite investigated three groups , for which they found significant spatial variations in the ratio of iron to @xmath1element abundances , concluding that both supernovae ( sne ) type  ia and ii must have contributed to the enrichment of the intracluster medium in groups .",
    "evidence for significant iron gradients in a sample of 10 groups and early - type galaxies were also found from _",
    "data by @xcite .",
    "@xcite followed this up using a larger sample of 18 cool clusters , but with only two systems at @xmath2  kev , while @xcite studied nine groups mainly in the context of their entropy profiles and the constraints they imposed on preheating scenarios .",
    "more recent work include the two - dimensional _ xmm - newton _ results of @xcite , but the main focus here was the entropy and pressure structure of the icm .",
    "thus , while most of these studies have focused on @xmath3  kev systems , detailed discussions of the abundance distributions and the implications for galaxy and group evolution have generally been limited and based on samples of just a few groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a dedicated study of chemical enrichment in a substantial number of groups has been lacking .    in the first paper in this series (",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , we presented projected radial profiles of temperature and fe and si abundance of the hot intragroup gas in a sample of 15 groups , discussing the results in a statistical framework .",
    "the groups were selected mainly from the gems sample of @xcite , on the basis of their good photon statistics in available _ chandra _ data and for their relatively undisturbed x - ray morphology . the low _ chandra _ background enabled robust abundance constraints to reasonably large radii , with the majority of our groups having fe and si profiles extracted to at least @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the radius enclosing a mean density of 500 times the critical density . at the same time , the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ allowed sampling of group cores at a level of detail usually unattainable with other x - ray telescopes .",
    "with only one exception ( ngc4125 ) , all the groups were found to contain cooler gas in the central regions .",
    "main results of the study included the discovery that fe abundances in the groups show a highly significant decrease with radius , declining continually from a central excess towards a value at @xmath0 which is , on average , lower than corresponding values seen in more massive clusters by a factor of two . in addition",
    ", it was found that fe enrichment in group cores is dominated by sn  ia as also found for more massive clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus confirming early , tentative _ asca _ results @xcite .",
    "the sn  ii contribution to enrichment increases with radius , however , and potentially becomes exclusive at radii approaching @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore some of the implications of these results . in section  [ sec , est ]",
    "we outline the derivation of gas and metal masses and the optical properties of the groups .",
    "section  [ sec , results ] presents the main results inferred from these quantities and from the observed abundance distributions , including the metal masses produced by sn  ia and sn  ii , the corresponding mass - to - light ratios , and the impact of sn in the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) and in the groups as a whole .",
    "one finding is that the metal mass - to - light ratios deviate substantially from results for more massive systems , and we explore a variety of possible explanations for this in section  [ sec , fate ] , along with some further implications for the feedback and chemical enrichment history of the groups in section  [ sec , filaments ] .",
    "section  [ sec , conclude ] briefly discusses and summarizes the results , including some general implications for structure formation .    as in paper",
    "i , we use the solar abundance table of @xcite , theoretical supernova yields from @xcite and @xcite , and the kendall rank - order correlation coefficient @xmath5 to quantify the significance @xmath6 of linear relationships .",
    "a value of @xmath7  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 is assumed throughout , and all errors are given at the 68  per  cent confidence level unless otherwise stated .",
    "results from paper  i for the abundance profiles are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] .",
    "the data points here are similar to those of fig .",
    "11 in paper  i , showing the results in radial bins of 20 measurements each .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the distinct features of these profiles , which are ( i ) a central abundance excess for both fe and si , often accompanied by a dip in the very centre for both elements ; ( ii ) a clear decline in fe abundance with radius towards a value of @xmath9  z@xmath10 at @xmath0 , with a somewhat less pronounced decline for si ( which furthermore flattens out or even rises at large radii ) . for reference ,",
    "the sn yields adopted here , as explained in paper  i , are @xmath11  m@xmath10 and @xmath12  m@xmath10 for fe and si from sn  ia , and @xmath13  m@xmath10 and @xmath14  m@xmath10 for core - collapse supernovae including sn  ii .",
    "this implies @xmath15  z@xmath16/z@xmath17 for sn  ia ejecta , 2.62  z@xmath16/z@xmath17 for those of sn  ii , and with a solar abundance ratio requiring 3.4  sn  ii per sn  ia .",
    "the impact of assuming different sets of sn yields will be discussed in section  [ sec , results ] .      for the majority of our groups",
    ", abundances could not be measured all the way out to @xmath0 . in order to enable predictions of @xmath18 beyond the radius of measurement for individual groups , as well as to facilitate visualisation of sample - averaged results , we made parametrizations of the average abundance profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] .",
    "this approach can be justified on the grounds that while the statistical uncertainties on @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be quite large for individual groups , the intrinsic scatter in these quantities is reasonably small outside the innermost regions . outside the peak of the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] , we have adopted the fitted relations of paper  i [ equations  ( 8) and ( 9 ) ] for these parametrizations . inside the peaks , a linear rise in log@xmath21 vs.  log@xmath22 has been assumed , normalised such as to ensure a continuous behaviour at the peaks . outside",
    "@xmath23 , where the vast majority of gas resides , the typical standard error on the mean in the individual bins in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin]a and [ fig , norm_bin]b is 16  per  cent for @xmath19 and 18  per  cent for @xmath20 . we have conservatively adopted 20  per  cent relative errors as representative for our parametrizations of both profiles .",
    "these 20  per  cent error envelopes are shown as shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] ; within these errors , the parametrizations are consistent with every data point in the figure .",
    "note that the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin]c is not a direct parametrization of the si / fe ratios , but results from the ratio of the parametrized si and fe profiles , with their adopted errors added in quadrature .",
    "unless otherwise stated , our analysis employs the observed abundance profiles of individual groups out to the edge of the usable _ chandra data _ , extrapolating these to larger radii where necessary using the above parametrizations and their associated errors .",
    "though obviously a model - dependent approach , the adopted parametrizations are at least empirically motivated across all radii considered here , and the resulting si / fe ratios remain consistent with commonly used sn model yields everywhere inside @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , as will be demonstrated , there is no clear evidence for the observed abundance profiles at large radii to be systematically different for , for example , high and low  temperature groups , so the adopted parametrizations should be reasonably representative for the entire group sample .",
    "the additional precaution of adopting conservative errors on these was taken to further alleviate concerns regarding this approach .",
    "for the calculation of gas and metal masses of the groups , we adopted a standard 1-d @xmath24model to describe the gas density profiles , using values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for each group taken from the literature .",
    "these values are listed in table  [ tab , gas ] below , taken from the _ rosat _ analyses of @xcite for ngc507 , ngc4125 , and ngc7619 , @xcite for ngc2300 , and @xcite for the remainder .",
    "the gas density profile of each group was normalised by means of the measured _ chandra _ flux in the 0.10.3  @xmath0 range , using the spectral normalisation @xmath26 from xspec , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the group distance ( from paper  i ) and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number densities of electrons and hydrogen atoms , respectively .",
    "the reason for normalising the profiles using the flux outside @xmath23 is that many of the published gas density parameters result from two - component fits , with one component used to describe the emission in and around the central galaxy , and the other , of interest here , to describe the extended group emission .",
    "this approach also reduces the impact of projection effects on the resulting normalisations , and suppresses effects related to blurring by the _ rosat _ point spread function .",
    "where relevant , a geometric correction was applied to @xmath26 , to account for lost detector area due to removed point sources and incomplete azimuthal coverage of the relevant radial range ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the median correction factor was 1.38 , with no significant dependence on , for example , mean group temperature .",
    "gas and metal masses were then calculated using the adopted @xmath24model parameters .",
    "errors on these masses within the radius of interest were obtained on the basis of 5,000 monte carlo realisations of the gas density and abundance profiles of each group . for each realisation , gas density parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and abundances ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) in each radial bin were drawn from gaussians with @xmath31 equal to the associated @xmath32 error . the final metal mass and its uncertainty were then obtained as the mean and @xmath31 of the resulting distribution of masses .",
    "these distributions are generally symmetric , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig , histo ] which shows an example outcome of this approach for the calculation of fe masses .",
    "as is the case for the abundance profiles , the gas density profiles have generally not been measured out to @xmath0 within our sample .",
    "where relevant , the adopted @xmath24-parameters were therefore used to extrapolate the gas density profile of each group beyond the radius of measurement .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to this extrapolation are not straightforward to quantify , because the number of gas mass measurements extending to @xmath0 in @xmath3  kev systems are still fairly limited ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ studies of groups to large radii @xcite suggest that standard @xmath24models can provide a good description of the profiles of relaxed groups out to , and beyond , @xmath0 .",
    "however , several studies have found the slope of the gas density profile in more massive clusters to steepen progressively at large radii , with typical slopes at @xmath0 that are @xmath33  per  cent steeper than the ` canonical ' cluster value of @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to account for this steepening , vikhlinin et  al .",
    "( 2006 ; see also @xcite ) multiply the standard @xmath24model for the density profile by a factor @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 fitted parameters .",
    "although the @xcite study was largely limited to @xmath39  kev systems ( leaving it unclear to what extent these results can be reliably extended to the regime of cool groups , whose density profiles inside @xmath0 tend to be flatter than those of clusters ; @xcite ) , we have investigated the impact of adopting the @xcite parametrization for our groups .",
    "mean values for the vikhlinin clusters are @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( from their table  2 ) , with no systematic dependence of these parameters on cluster temperature ; adopting these values , we find that our gas masses within @xmath0 could , on average , be overestimated by 24  per  cent ( with a small standard deviation of 4  per  cent ) .",
    "this is within the adopted systematic uncertainty on @xmath42 ( see section  [ sec , comparison ] ) , so within these adopted errors , our gas masses should be robust towards such changes in the assumed shape of the density profile .",
    "furthermore , any trends in @xmath42based quantities with mean system temperature would not be significantly affected by such a change .",
    "many of the cluster comparison results presented in the following may also be subject to similar corrections , so our overall conclusions should remain valid irrespective of such a change .      in order to derive mass - to - light ratios and to estimate the expected supernova rate in the groups , @xmath43- and",
    "@xmath44-band luminosities of the group members were also derived inside @xmath0 .",
    "luminosities were computed from extinction - corrected galaxy magnitudes in ned using the method of @xcite : galaxies were extracted inside @xmath0 and within a velocity interval of @xmath45 around the mean recession velocity @xmath46 of the group , using starting values of @xmath46 and velocity dispersion @xmath47 from @xcite where available , or from @xcite otherwise .",
    "these quantities were then re - evaluated iteratively until convergence was reached . the only exception to this rule was ngc1407 , for which a velocity range extending to @xmath48 was employed .",
    "this was done in order to include the second brightest group galaxy , ngc1400 , which has an unusually large peculiar velocity of @xmath49  km  s@xmath8 relative to the group mean @xcite .",
    "the adopted @xmath43-band magnitudes of the group members generally derive from two - micron all sky survey data ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "inspection of a composite histogram of the apparent magnitudes suggests that incompleteness sets in around @xmath50 for our groups , consistent with the expectation that the 2mass source catalog is 90  per  cent complete down to @xmath51 for extended sources more than @xmath52 from the galactic plane @xcite , a region covering 12 of our 15 groups . for each group , we corrected for incompleteness below the absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath53 using the schechter fit of @xcite to the @xmath43-band luminosity function of 93 groups and clusters ( and including their correction factor to obtain the schechter normalisation inside @xmath0 instead of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the resulting corrections are typically small , on average 5  per  cent .    in order to facilitate comparison to existing results in the literature ,",
    "@xmath44-band magnitudes of the group members were also extracted from ned in a similar manner . in four of the groups , magnitudes had to be converted from the @xmath55-band for a few galaxies .",
    "this was done assuming @xmath44@xmath56 as is appropriate for early - type galaxies .",
    "while this could lead to a slight underestimation of @xmath57 , we found that using instead @xmath58 as for spirals resulted in a mere 4  per  cent increase in @xmath57 for ngc4325 , with the change being less than 0.5  per  cent for the remaining three groups .",
    "we have refrained from taking these minute corrections into account in the error budget .",
    "since the optical magnitudes generally derive from a variety of heterogeneous data sets with varying completeness , we have not attempted a similar correction for incompleteness as applied to the @xmath43-band data .",
    "following @xcite , we instead simply aimed to homogenize completeness across the sample by applying an absolute magnitude cut to all groups .",
    "this cut discarded galaxies fainter than @xmath59 , retaining an expected 90  per  cent of the @xmath44-band luminosity of the galaxy population .    finally , using the derived @xmath44- and @xmath43-band luminosities and the corresponding @xmath44@xmath43 colours , estimates of the total stellar masses @xmath60 of the groups and their central galaxies",
    "were obtained using the coefficients listed in table  1 of @xcite , which imply @xmath61 for the @xmath43-band stellar mass - to - light ratio of the group members .",
    "we note that our approach implies that our @xmath44@xmath43 colours could be slightly but systematically biased towards the red , because we are attempting to account for all @xmath43-band light by performing a completeness correction while only retaining an expected 90  per  cent of the @xmath44-band light .",
    "this could lead to overestimates of stellar mass which , while potentially varying from group to group , should not exceed 0.02  dex , i.e.  5  per  cent , and so this bias has no substantive impact on our results .",
    "although not themselves the focus of the present study , reliable gas masses are still important ingredients in this work , so we briefly discuss the robustness of our adopted approach .",
    "for example , while the derived statistical errors from our monte carlo calculations are small for most groups , one concern is whether the adopted @xmath24parameters and our method of normalising the density profile are robust .",
    "another is that our approach does not take into account radial variations of the plasma emissivity . to explore the potential impact of this ,",
    "we have compared our gas mass estimates to published values for the groups for which we have been able to find useful comparison data in the literature , consisting of either _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ , or _ suzaku _",
    "measurements published within a given radius using different approaches @xcite . at larger radii , we have also compared our results within @xmath0 to those obtained using the density parametrizations of @xcite based on _ rosat _ data .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , compare ] .",
    "the figure indicates that there is no clear systematic variation between our results and other estimates , with most estimates agreeing to within @xmath62  per  cent .",
    "an exception is the clearly discrepant ngc5846 , for which the @xcite parametrization yields a gas mass within @xmath0 which is only 65  per  cent of our estimate .",
    "however , even when including this system , the average deviation of our estimates from existing results is only 10  per  cent for all measurements , or 17  per cent if only including the independent largest - radius estimate for each group .",
    "we therefore consider a 25  per  cent error a reasonably conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty associated with our method of gas mass estimation , so we have added this uncertainty in quadrature to those related to any quantity based on @xmath42 .    since the time of our original _",
    "analysis , performed using ciao 3.0 with calibration database caldb 3.2.3 , updated calibration data including a recalibration of the _ chandra _ effective area have been released . to briefly test the potential impact of this update on our results",
    ", we rederived the temperature and abundance profiles for ngc4325 , a group typical of our sample in terms of signal - to - noise ratio and mean icm temperature . for this updated analysis , we employed the most recent calibration data , caldb 4.1.2 , with ciao 4.1 , following the spectral fitting procedure described in paper  i. we find that the updated temperature measurements are perfectly consistent with the original values in all radial bins , and the results for the fe and si profiles , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , n4325 ] , also demonstrate good consistency throughout , with no systematic offset between the new and original results . in fact , the main effect of using the updated calibration data is a considerable reduction in the statistical uncertainties of most measurements .",
    "we therefore conclude that our original results should generally be robust to the recent changes to the _ chandra _ calibration .        as a further indicator of the robustness of our abundance measurements",
    ", we point to the good overall agreement with the independently obtained _ xmm _ results presented by @xcite ( see discussion in paper  i ) , in particular the excellent agreement across the full radial range between our sample - averaged fe profile in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] and the corresponding _ xmm _ result ( johnson et  al . , in preparation )",
    ". encouragingly , good agreement is also seen when comparing our metal masses derived within specific radii to the corresponding _ xmm _",
    "results for ngc5044 @xcite and the _ suzaku _ results for hcg62 @xcite , ngc507 @xcite , and ngc5044 @xcite , once differences in the adopted abundance table have been taken into account .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig , compare2 ] ( left panel ) , demonstrating consistency at the @xmath63  level between ours and existing results in all four cases . comparing also our resulting fe mass - to - light ratios to the corresponding _ suzaku _ estimates in fig .",
    "[ fig , compare2 ] ( right panel ) , good overall agreement is again seen , with hcg62 as the only exception . since the derived fe masses for this group are consistent , this discrepancy stems from differences in the assumed value of @xmath57 within @xmath64  arcmin , with the value of @xcite , @xmath65  l@xmath10 ( derived by converting @xmath55-band magnitudes to the @xmath44-band assuming a fixed @xmath44@xmath55 colour ) , being significantly lower than our value of @xmath66  l@xmath10 obtained with the approach outlined in the previous section .",
    "this minor issue notwithstanding , we conclude that our results for both gas masses , metal masses , and metal mass - to - light ratios generally show good agreement with existing results in the literature , thus lending credibility to our approach .",

    "moreover , the spatial distribution of stellar mass loss products is not straightforward to predict , since both [ z / h ] and [ @xmath1/fe ] in early - type stellar populations tend to show radial gradients ; while [ z / h ] generally peaks towards the galactic centre , @xmath1/fe gradients may be positive , negative , or flat , and the mean absolute value may depend on galaxy mass @xcite , implying that the fe fraction and abundance ratio in stellar winds may be a highly non - trivial function of radius and of the environment of the bgg .",
    "a detailed exploration of this would likely require x - ray data of a superior quality and is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we can briefly summarize the results of the previous section as follows .",
    "cool - core groups tend to show similar levels of central enrichment to those of more massive systems , but abundance gradients outside the core are stronger , leading to lower abundances at large radii .",
    "group outskirts are heavily dominated by sn  ii enrichment , with the total energy per icm baryon injected by sn somewhat lower than in more massive systems . at the same time , the global gas mass for a given amount of stellar light is lower in cooler systems within @xmath0 , leading to lower global metal mass - to - light ratios , both for sn  ia and sn  ii products .",
    "the latter result in particular may hold important information on the enrichment history of these systems . in this section",
    "we investigate a range of possible explanations for this while acknowledging that this is not necessarily an exhaustive list .",
    "fundamentally , these explanations can be divided into mechanisms causing ( i ) less efficient metal generation or metal transfer to the icm in low - mass systems , ( ii ) removal of metals from groups over cosmic time , or ( iii ) cosmological accretion of less enriched gas in small systems .      as an example of a mechanism belonging to the first category mentioned above , we first consider the possibility of a reduced galaxy formation efficiency at low @xmath67 .",
    "everything else being equal , this would lower the amount of fe released per unit icm mass , and although this can not in itself explain the observed imlr variations ( unless the stellar initial mass function also varies with environment ) , it could help explain the globally lower metal abundances seen in cooler systems .    we can test this scenario on the basis of the gas mass - to - light ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig , gas ] , or equivalently , the ratio of stellar mass @xmath60 to that of baryons , @xmath176 ( sometimes denoted the cold fraction @xmath177 , or the star formation efficiency ) shown in fig .  [ fig , starbar ] .",
    "this plot indicates a general decrease in cold fraction with @xmath74 ( @xmath178 , strengthening to @xmath179 if excluding the somewhat peculiar ngc2300 ; see paper  i ) , but with a tendency for this quantity to be higher than corresponding results for clusters @xcite .",

    ", there is no relative dearth of stellar mass within our groups , and we can readily exclude more exotic scenarios to account for the lower imlr such as the possibility that the stellar population has simply produced systematically fewer metals in cool groups ; the metallicity of the stellar population is typically at least @xmath93 solar in many of the bright early - types in our groups , with no obvious differences from central cluster galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "cooler systems have lower characteristic entropies @xcite and hence cooling times @xcite , and so a larger fraction of their hot gas can be expected to cool out . as discussed by @xcite , a higher galaxy / star formation efficiency in low - mass systems",
    "could also be promoted by an increased efficiency of tidal interactions ( boosting star formation rates ) and a decreased efficiency of strangulation , i.e  the stripping of any gas halo of late - type galaxies .",

    "while several explanations may be possible for these results , the data are at least consistent with a scenario in which the ( generally bluer and less massive ) galaxies in our cooler groups have experienced slightly more extended star formation histories , whereas the conversion of the available gas into stars was completed earlier in the more massive galaxies in hotter groups . as a consequence , star formation and metal production ( from sn  ia in particular )",
    "might be progressively ` delayed ' in lower - mass systems .",
    "although these results should be regarded as tentative ( @xmath190 for a correlation between @xmath191 and total @xmath44@xmath43 colour ) , they could be a manifestation of the observation that more massive early - type galaxies tend to be older , i.e.  have completed the bulk of their star formation ( and the associated icm enrichment by sn  ii and stellar winds ) at higher redshift ( ` downsizing ' , e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as an effect by which such galaxies at fixed mass tend to be slightly older in more massive environments ( e.g.  @xcite ) , perhaps indicative of an environmental dependence of downsizing .",
    "this interpretation is also in accord with the inference of @xcite that the fraction of baryons processed through stars is lower in lower - density environments compared to in rich clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the inferred average colour variations between galaxies in the cool and hot groups are small , @xmath192 , so it remains highly questionable whether average star formation histories have varied sufficiently with group mass to explain the observed order - of - magnitude variation in imlr from both sn  ia and sn  ii .    in conclusion",

    ", the simulations of @xcite indicate that the higher cold fraction in cool systems ( which , naively , could be expected to result in higher icm metal abundances ) , is compensated for by galactic outflows that drive more metals out of the potentials of cooler systems .",

    "we consider these mechanisms in turn , posing the question of whether metals have been released less efficiently into the icm in cooler groups .",
    "one immediately attractive feature of this possibility is its potential to account for the lower metal mass - to - light ratios of both sn  ia and sn  ii products .",
    "for example , gaseous stripping would likely affect both sn  ia and sn  ii products , and tidally stripped intracluster stars should release both sn  ia and sn  ii metals with equal efficiency .",
    "in addition , any metal release mechanism whose efficiency scales with system temperature might alleviate the need for a redshift - dependent sn  ia rate in the bgg ( section  [ sec , central ] ) , and help explain the observed @xmath21@xmath98 trend in group cores .",

    "in addition , evidence for ongoing or past stripping associated with galaxy  icm interactions is present in a few of our groups @xcite .",
    "general support for this interpretation comes from the work of @xcite who find a larger scatter in metallicity than in entropy in the group cores within their sample , which they interpret as evidence for diversity in the origin of gas in the cores .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite notes that if , e.g. , ram pressure stripping were important for icm enrichment , then hotter clusters with higher galaxy velocity dispersion should show relatively higher icm abundances .",

    "this trend is certainly consistent with a density  dependent metal release mechanism in group cores , whose efficiency scales with galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "if ram pressure stripping is the culprit , we might expect the icm abundance in the central region to scale more strongly with the characteristic ram pressure in this region than with group temperature . in order to test this possibility ,",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath47 of each group ( table  [ tab , gas ] ) , was used to estimate the characteristic ram pressure within @xmath116 . assuming @xmath213 , with @xmath214 , we find evidence for a moderately significant correlation between @xmath215 and the mass - weighted fe abundance within @xmath116 ( @xmath216 ) , though the correlation of @xmath19 with @xmath74 is actually stronger [ @xmath217 for own groups , @xmath218 when including those of @xcite as discussed in section  [ sec , zt ] ] .",

    "if affected by velocity anisotropies or small - number statistics ( although 13 out of our 15 groups have more than 10 members ) , we thus find that results are consistent with ram pressure stripping contributing to enrichment in group core , but the evidence is tentative at best , and we can not rule out other density - dependent mechanisms as more important .",
    "moreover , as this process should be inefficient at large radii ( and where , indeed , no clear trend in @xmath21 with @xmath98 exists ) , we conclude that the reduced efficiency of stripping through galaxy  icm interactions in cooler systems is unlikely to account for their lower imlrs or for the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig , release ] .",
    "note that if the metallicity  temperature trend in group cores does reflects an increased efficiency of environment  driven gas loss from galaxies in hotter groups , then the absence of a similar trend in systems with @xmath128  kev @xcite may suggest that such processes ` saturate ' at @xmath2213  kev , perhaps as a consequence of near  complete gas removal from core galaxies in clusters above these temperatures .",
    "it has yet to be established to what extent this possibility is in accord with simulation results , which suggest that only a minor fraction ( @xmath222  per  cent ) of the global icm metal budget even in massive clusters can be accounted for by ram - pressure stripping , though with the fraction considerably higher in cluster cores @xcite .",

    "our data do not allow useful constraints on the contribution of this process to icm enrichment , however , and cosmological simulations may still lack the dynamic range to robustly assess whether it has been substantially less efficient or influential in low - mass systems compared to clusters .",

    "of course , the derived rates assume that gas in group cores was already enriched to solar levels by @xmath234 and has been subject to unimpeded cooling ever since .",
    "these estimates are thus likely representing a best - case scenario , and the total missing gas mass becomes correspondingly larger if assuming a lower @xmath19 for the removed gas .",

    "this is corroborated by the fact that there is no clear tendency for the bgg to be bluer in cooler systems ( @xmath244 ) where cooling is expected to be more efficient .",
    "further , large amounts of recent cooling - induced star formation seems incompatible with the inferred ages of the stellar population in many of the bggs , which are of order 10  gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "although the latter case may not necessarily be completely at variance with the typical history of mass build - up and star formation in these galaxies ( which may still have assembled a significant fraction of their current stellar mass since @xmath250 ) , there is an additional and very powerful constraint on the allowing cooling rates arising from the presence of the central fe excesses . as the typical estimated iron injection rate from the bgg is of order @xmath185",

    ". it may not be sufficient to entirely explain the similarity breaking between groups and clusters , or the presence of an ` entropy ramp ' in group and cluster cores , but it certainly eases the energetic requirements imposed on any other source to deliver the remaining heating , and it may leave limited scope for agn feedback . in the cluster regime , numerical simulations @xcite suggest that a feedback mechanism not associated with sn has to be acting at early stages of cluster formation , before most of the mass is accreted in the cluster potential well , in order to avoid the centrally peaked fe distribution seen in some simulations . at lower masses , however , where our results show stronger fe gradients that in clusters , the need for agn feedback is perhaps less pressing .",
    "the simulation work of @xcite , for example , indicates that elevated entropy levels in groups may be largely explained by radiative cooling combined with sn - driven outflows , with no strong need for agn - driven preheating .",
    "regardless of the heating source , the energetic requirements for blow - out of gas via buoyancy discussed in section  [ sec , gasloss ] would be strongly relaxed if the surrounding material is at a lower overdensity than currently seen in group cores .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig , agn ] is based on assuming current icm densities within @xmath334  kpc of the group cores , which generally translate into cosmic overdensities of order @xmath335 .",
    "if the gas to be heated has lower overdensities by a factor @xmath249 ( certainly realistic for pre - virialized structures such as inflowing filaments ) , the requirements for heating it to current entropies at @xmath0 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath138 , i.e.  to just @xmath322  kev  particle@xmath8 on average .",
    "this should be within range of _ either _ sn or agn at @xmath336 , suggesting that the energy required to drive metals out of filaments is , indeed , available .",
    "whether the balance between bulk gas loss and selective loss of both sn  ia and sn  ii products suggested by our results can be achieved is a non - trivial question though .",
    "the shortfall of sn  ii products in groups seems largely explicable on the basis of pre - collapse metal loss in starburst winds , but removal of large amounts of fe from sn  ia at early epochs may also require some of this material to have been synthesized very rapidly , for example by a population of sn  ia exploding promptly after star formation .",
    "the existence of such a population has been proposed by @xcite on the basis of observed sn  ia rates at high redshift , but the need for this population at early times is still debated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even in the ` standard ' sn  ia delay - time scenario , a non - negligible fraction of sn  ia products may have been released at fairly high redshift .",
    "for example , the model of @xcite predicts a peak in the sn  ia iron injection rate at @xmath336 in satellite galaxies and even earlier in the central galaxy .    while some sn  ia material _ may _ thus have been ejected from cool systems in early starburst winds , our discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig , sn ] , which shows that the sn  ia contribution becomes insignificant outside @xmath337 still argues against a significant pre - collapse sn  ia contribution and so against substantial loss of sn  ia metals from filaments . to explore this issue further , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig , snia ] fe masses from sn  ia within different radial intervals , all simply normalised by total stellar light @xmath78 .",
    "the plot suggests that , over the mass range considered here , the reduction in imlr@xmath105 in lower - mass systems has preferentially occurred within the central group regions , with no trend with @xmath288 seen beyond @xmath113 .",
    "this preferential loss of sn  ia products from the central fe peak seems consistent with post - collapse agn outflows ( and possibly some cooling ) as important contributors to the shortfall of sn  ia products in cool systems .",
    "the considerations in section  [ sec , agn ] then suggest that this loss can not generally have occurred very recently but rather must have taken place over considerable time - scales following group collapse .    .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ fig , zt ] , only groups with data covering the full radial interval are shown in each panel .",
    "labels in lower right corners specify the significance @xmath6 of any linear correlation.,width=317 ]",
    "based on the results presented in paper  i in this series @xcite , in this second of two papers we have investigated the distribution and total mass of sn  ia and sn  ii products in the icm of 15 groups , for comparison to the total icm mass and to the optical luminosities and stellar masses of the group members .",
    "we re - emphasize here that our group sample was not intended to be statistically representative in any sense .",
    "nevertheless , the results should still provide useful constraints on models of the evolution of galactic systems on scales from small groups to massive clusters .",
    "we note that there are features of the observed abundance distributions that we have not covered in any detail .",
    "these include the broad extent of the central abundance excess , reaching well beyond the distribution of stellar light from the central galaxy , as well as the curious abundance dips seen for both fe and si at the very centre for several groups , manifest also in the averaged profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig , norm_bin ] . any detailed discussion of these features is likely to benefit from comparison of group properties to those of non - cool core systems , however , and so is deferred to a future paper .",
    "our existing results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "as anticipated , the total mass of iron and silicon in the hot gas within @xmath0 scales strongly with total group mass as measured by the mean x - ray temperature outside any cool core .",
    "values range from @xmath338  m@xmath10 and @xmath339  m@xmath10 across the 0.32.1  kev temperature range of the sample .",
    "sn  ii have provided on average @xmath86  per  cent of the fe and @xmath340  per  cent of the si inside @xmath0 , with a mildly significant tendency ( at @xmath341 ) towards increasing sn  ii dominance in cooler systems .",
    "2 .   for the sample as a whole ,",
    "the distribution of sn  ia products is strongly peaked towards the group core , whereas sn  ii enrichment is nearly uniform throughout the icm .",
    "the fe mass within @xmath116 ( roughly the size of the cool core , where present ) can be explained by prolonged enrichment by sn  ia in the central early - type galaxy , aided by stellar mass loss and intracluster stars . in particular , if adopting a plausible model for the cosmic evolution of the sn  ia rate , typical enrichment time - scales are @xmath3427  gyr in all groups , comparable to similar results for central cluster galaxies .",
    "the mild central rise observed for sn  ii products can be explained by stellar mass loss from the central galaxy , potentially with an additional contribution from metals released by other group galaxies via density  dependent release mechanisms such as galaxy  icm interactions .",
    "due to the combination of lower gas mass - to - light ratios and metal abundances in cooler systems , resulting aggregate metal mass - to - light ratios within @xmath0 show an order - of - magnitude variation across the sample , only approaching results for massive clusters at the high  temperature end . for a given amount of stellar light",
    ", there is thus a substantial shortfall of x - ray metals in cooler systems , a deficiency which is found to be present both for sn  ia and sn  ii products .",
    "this suggests that metals from both sn  types were either synthesized or released from galaxies less efficiently in lower - mass systems , that metals were lost from such systems , or that the intergalactic gas accreted by small groups was less enriched than that accreted by more massive systems 4 .",
    "both fe and si abundances in group cores ( @xmath343 ) show a positive trend with group temperature which is significant at @xmath344 .",
    "no corresponding trend is seen at larger radii ( @xmath345 ) however , arguing against recent preferential loss of enriched material from cooler systems as an explanation of their lower global metal - mass - to - light ratios .",
    "estimates of the current mechanical power of the central agn in the groups indicate that the metallicity trend in group cores may at least be partly due to the expulsion of enriched material to beyond @xmath116 by agn  driven buoyant bubbles , perhaps with some contribution from radiative cooling of enriched gas in the core , causing less enriched material to flow inwards .",
    "alternatively , it can be understood as due to the action of a metal release mechanism whose efficiency depends on local icm density and the total mass of the system , such as ram pressure stripping , but it can not be explained by a systematic variation in the contribution from intracluster stars with group temperature .",
    "the absence of a similar reported trend in systems above @xmath346  kev may indicate that the relevant processes ` saturate ' in cluster cores , perhaps as a consequence of near - complete gas removal from core galaxies in such environments , or due to the larger heating energies or time - scales required to accomplish significant metal removal by agn outflows or radiative cooling in such systems .",
    "5 .   as a consequence of the lower fe abundances and",
    "mildly increased contribution from sn  ii in cooler systems ( i.e.  higher @xmath1/fe  ratios ) , we find tentative evidence for the icm within the central few hundred kpc ( @xmath347 ) to appear chemically less ` evolved ' in these groups",
    ". this may reflect a more extended star formation history in less massive groups , consistent with the slightly bluer average galaxy colour seen in these systems .",
    "metal release from galaxies to the icm appears to have been efficient in these groups , with , on average , an estimated @xmath348  per  cent of the metals synthesized in galaxies currently present in the icm .",
    "while this is in fair agreement with recent independent estimates in clusters @xcite , there is also some evidence for the release fraction to be systematically lower , and well below cluster values , in the cooler groups in our sample .",
    "7 .   among possible explanations for the metal deficiency in groups within @xmath0",
    ", we can rule out radiative cooling as an important gas and metal sink .",
    "some contribution may instead come from the more extended star formation histories and lower metal release efficiencies in cooler systems , as well as the tendency for such systems to contain a relatively larger fraction of their gas beyond @xmath0 . within the current icm configuration ,",
    "the energetic requirements for the necessary gas and metal loss induced by agn or sn - driven winds are rather large ( although not necessarily prohibitively so ) , generally favouring loss of material at the incipient stages of group evolution . other mechanisms such as thermal conduction transporting gas and metals out beyond @xmath0 in cooler systems can probably be ruled out , due to the strong temperature dependence anticipated for heat conduction unsuppressed by magnetic fields ( spitzer conductivity @xmath349 ) .",
    "comparison to observed ratios of sn  ia to core - collapse sn in deep field data @xcite shows that group cores display abundance ratios consistent with inferred sn ratios in the low - redshift universe ( @xmath320 ) but are inconsistent with predictions for @xmath318 .",
    "this argues in favour of relatively recent enrichment of the central group regions , including the build - up of the central abundance excesses over the past @xmath3508  gyr .",
    "in contrast , the heavily sn  ii - dominated abundance ratios in group outskirts does agree with predictions for @xmath318 , suggesting that most of the icm was enriched to @xmath9 solar at redshifts close to the peak of the cosmic star formation rate .",
    "the near - uniform radial distribution of sn  ii products corroborates this picture by arguing in favour of substantial sn  ii enrichment prior to or during group collapse .",
    "this raises the possibility that powerful starburst winds at high redshift have contributed significantly to the gas and metal deficiency in groups , causing loss of baryons from the filaments feeding the growth of these structures .",
    "the estimated sn explosion energy associated with high-@xmath351 star formation in the group members seems sufficient for this , and may further have provided a substantial fraction of the preheating energy required by some models for explaining the x - ray scaling properties of groups .",
    "if so , it is not clear that a prominent contribution to preheating from quasar activity is required in these systems .",
    "post - collapse agn feedback can nevertheless still have played a prominent role in subsequently ejecting mainly sn  ia metals from group potentials .",
    "one implication of our results is that present - day clusters can not have formed through hierarchical build - up of smaller structures resembling the groups studied here .",
    "this is , of course , already clear from the well - established differences in cold fraction ( cf.section  [ sec , sfe ] ) , but the deficiency of gas - phase metals in smaller systems poses an additional problem for this scenario .",
    "of course there is no compelling reason to believe that present - day groups are chemically similar to those that participated in cluster build - up at higher redshift , although our considerations suggest that the metal deficiency in low - mass systems has not been established recently .",
    "alternatively , the proto - clusters into which such groups merged have been massive enough to retain or re - accrete enriched material shed by their smaller progenitors .",
    "deep x - ray observations of high@xmath351 groups may eventually shed light on these issues , but the questions are unlikely to be settled by the current generation of x - ray satellites .",
    "numerical work may also provide clues to the chemical properties of cluster progenitors and in which ways these depart from those of our groups .",
    "a prerequisite for such a comparison , however , is that models can accurately reproduce observational results for the icm abundance distribution in groups at low redshift .",
    "while significant improvements have been made in the past few years in this regard , some issues remain such as reproducing the observed distribution of @xmath1elements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , our groups are conceivably not representative of ( x - ray ) groups in general .",
    "although exhibiting x - ray luminosities that span two orders of magnitude @xcite , our group sample is still largely restricted to cool - core groups that appear morphologically undisturbed . in order to gain a more complete picture of the enrichment and feedback history in groups , similar analyses would need to be extended to a more heterogeneous group sample , including a substantial number of systems without a cool core . at higher masses ,",
    "such systems tend to show much flatter abundance gradients than those reported here ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting fundamental differences in icm enrichment and heating histories between cool - core and non  cool core systems .",
    "such a comparison is the subject of ongoing work ( johnson et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and may ultimately help in providing an improved understanding of the chemical and thermodynamical evolution of baryons in both galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",

    "<S> we investigate the history of galactic feedback and chemical enrichment within a sample of 15 x - ray bright groups of galaxies , on the basis of the inferred fe and si distributions in the hot gas and the associated metal masses produced by core - collapse and type  ia supernovae ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of these cool - core groups show a central fe and si excess , which can be explained by prolonged enrichment by sn  ia and stellar winds in the central early - type galaxy alone , but with tentative evidence for additional processes contributing to core enrichment in hotter groups . </S>",
    "<S> inferred metal mass - to - light ratios inside @xmath0 show a positive correlation with total group mass but are generally significantly lower than in clusters , due to a combination of lower global icm abundances and gas - to - light ratios in groups . </S>",
    "<S> this metal deficiency is present for products from both sn  ia and sn  ii , and suggests that metals were either synthesized , released from galaxies , or retained within the icm less efficiently in lower - mass systems . </S>",
    "<S> we explore possible causes , including variations in galaxy formation and metal release efficiency , cooling - out of metals , and gas and metal loss via agn or starburst - driven galactic winds from groups or their precursor filaments . </S>",
    "<S> loss of enriched material from filaments coupled with post - collapse agn feedback emerge as viable explanations , but we also find evidence for metals to have been released less efficiently from galaxies in cooler groups and for the icm in these to appear chemically less evolved , possibly reflecting more extended star formation histories in less massive systems . some implications for the hierarchical growth of clusters from groups are briefly discussed .    </S>",
