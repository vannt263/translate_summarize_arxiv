    "an important test of the standard model of particle physics  @xcite ( and the extent of its validity ) is to measure and understand the properties of the highest - energy particle collisions .",
    "the chief predictions of the standard model for these collisions are the numbers and varieties of fundamental particles , i.e. , the fermions and gauge bosons of the standard model , that are produced .",
    "the observation of an anomalous production rate of any combination of such particles is therefore a clear indication of a new physical process .",
    "this paper describes an analysis of the production of a set of combinations involving at least one photon and at least one lepton ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) , using 86  pb@xmath4 of data from proton - antiproton collisions collected with the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf )  @xcite during the 1994 - 95 run of the fermilab tevatron .",
    "production of these particular combinations of particles is of interest for several reasons .",
    "events with photons and leptons are potentially related to the puzzling `` @xmath7 '' event recorded by cdf  @xcite .",
    "a supersymmetric model  @xcite designed to explain the @xmath7 event predicts the production of photons from the radiative decay of the @xmath8 neutralino , and leptons through the decay of charginos , indicating @xmath9 events as a signal for the production of a chargino - neutralino pair .",
    "other hypothetical , massive particles could subsequently decay to one or more standard model electroweak gauge bosons , one of which could be a photon and the other of which could be a leptonically decaying @xmath10 or @xmath11 boson .",
    "in addition , photon - lepton studies complement similarly motivated inclusive searches for new physics in diphoton  @xcite , photon - jet  @xcite , and photon-@xmath12-quark events  @xcite .",

    "categories of photon - lepton events are defined _ a priori _ in a way that characterizes the different possibilities for new physics .",
    "for each category , the inclusive event total is compared with standard model expectations , and a few simple kinematic distributions are presented for further examination .",
    "the decay products of massive particles are typically isolated from other particles , and possess large transverse momentum and low rapidity .",
    "this search is therefore limited to those events with at least one isolated , central ( @xmath13 ) photon with @xmath14 , and at least one isolated , central electron or muon with @xmath15 .",
    "studying this class of events has the added advantage of highly efficient detection and data acquisition .",
    "these photon - lepton candidates are further partitioned by angular separation .",
    "events where exactly one photon and one lepton are detected nearly opposite in azimuth ( @xmath16 ) are characteristic of a two - particle final state ( two - body photon - lepton events ) , and the remaining photon - lepton events are characteristic of three or more particles in the final state ( multi - body photon - lepton events ) .",
    "the inclusive event totals and kinematic properties of each of these two categories are studied .",
