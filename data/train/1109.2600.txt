    "the unconventional superconductors have a rich phase diagram determined by the interplay of multiple competing , or coexisting , types of order .",
    "nematic order ( which breaks the c@xmath0 symmetry of the underlying square lattice down to c@xmath1 ) has been shown to emerge in certain regimes of the phase diagrams of the copper - oxide @xcite and the iron - based @xcite superconductors . in the latter case ,",
    "the nematic order accompanies ( and in some cases , precedes ) the magnetic order which occurs at a wavevector that breaks the lattice rotational symmetry .",
    "recently , the structure of the vortex cores in the mixed state of clean fese films was studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "strong anisotropy was observed in the zero bias conductance map around the cores , which have an eccentricity of the order of unity .",
    "although the lattice structure of fese at low temperature is orthorhombic@xcite , it has been claimed @xcite that the crystalline anisotropy ( of the order of a few tenths of a percent ) is too small to explain the large anisotropy of the vortex cores , which is likely to have an electronic origin .",
    "this experiment raises several questions , some of which we address in this paper : assuming that there is an electronic nematic order in superconducting fese , what is its microscopic origin ? what is its relation to superconductivity - _",
    ", are these two types of order competing ? is the nematic order localized in the vortex cores ( and hence stabilized by the application of the magnetic field ) , or does it extend throughout the system ( and is only apparent in the stm spectrum near the cores ) ?    here , we study the structure of the vortex core using a phenomenological landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory in terms of two competing order parameters . using our lg analysis",
    "we have calculated the structure of an isolated vortex in the presence of the nematic order .",
    "our main result is that by looking at the profile of the gap near the vortex core , it is possible to distinguish between two different configurations of the nematic order , namely the presence of a localized nematic order within the superconducting vortex as opposed to the presence of a long range nematic order in the system .",
    "if the nematic order is localized at the core , the superconducting gap should be anisotropic only near the core and the anisotropy decays exponentially as we move away from the core .",
    "on the other hand , if the nematic order is long - ranged , the superconducting gap should exhibit an anisotropy which decays as a power law .",
    "if the nematic order is near its critical point , there is a large region in which the anisotropy of the gap depends logarithmically on the distance , eventually crossing over to a power law .",
    "moreover , we find qualitative differences in the shape of the contours of constant gap around the core in the different cases .",
    "if the nematic order exists only in the cores , the equal - gap contours tend to be elliptical ; if the nematic order is long - ranged , we find that the gap function tends to develop a `` four - lobe '' structure , with more pronounced higher harmonics .",
    "these features can be sought in stm experiments by mapping the magnitude of the gap around the core as a function of position .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ mod ] we introduce the lg functional with the two competing order parameters and carry out a preliminary analysis in the absence of the anisotropy . in section [ pd ] , we investigate the mean - field phase diagram of a single vortex . in section [ min ] , we introduce the anisotropy and perform a numerical minimization of the functional , commenting on the interesting features .",
    "finally , in section [ anis ] , we present our analytical results explaining the various interesting features observed by minimizing the free energy .",
    "we consider a lg type free energy for two competing order parameters : a complex field @xmath2 , describing the superconducting order parameter , and a real field @xmath3 , which describes a nematic order that competes with the superconducting order parameter .",

    "before we begin our analysis , let us comment about the choice of parametrization in this problem .",
    "we would like to think of this problem in terms of a fixed @xmath23 . then",
    "on choosing a particular ratio of the length scales of @xmath3 and @xmath22 , we still have one degree of freedom left in terms of the masses or the stiffnesses of the two order parameters , which is fixed by tuning @xmath24 .    if we assume that @xmath25 , then the uniform ground state is given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this also constrains @xmath3 to be localized around the vortex cores , by making the mass term for @xmath3 positive deep inside the superconducting region .",
    "if we further assume that the nematic order is small , such that @xmath28 , then we can essentially ignore the feedback of @xmath3 on @xmath22 .",

    "there are three possible phases : in phase i , @xmath27 everywhere ; in phase ii , @xmath3 vanishes at large distance from the vortex core but becomes non - zero near the vortex core due to the suppression of the competing @xmath22 field to zero at the core ; and in phase iii , @xmath39 even far away from the core . a non - zero solution for @xmath3 is favored whenever the smallest eigenvalue @xmath40 of the following eigenvalue problem @xcite : @xmath41^{2}\\bigg]\\phi\\left(x\\right)=\\epsilon\\phi\\left(x\\right ) , \\label{eigeqn}\\ ] ] satisfies @xmath42 . in order to find the phase diagram , we solve this eigenvalue problem numerically on a discrete grid .",

    "the microscopic origin of the anisotropic vortex cores observed in fese@xcite remains to be understood .",

    "an interesting feature associated with the lg functional introduced in section [ mod ] is that there is an instability to a state with modulated @xmath22 .",
    "this arises due to a competition between two terms in the free energy , namely the @xmath3 and @xmath138 terms .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath3 does not vary spatially and @xmath139 .",
    "then at leading order , the contribution to the free energy from @xmath3 is of the form @xmath140 from the above expression , we see that for a sufficiently large @xmath141 , it becomes energetically favorable to gain energy from the second term by condensing a large negative value of @xmath3 . by extremizing the above with respect to @xmath3",
    ", we obtain @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the contribution to free energy from @xmath143 is @xmath144 .",
    "this energy gain from a non - zero @xmath145 always dominates over the energy cost of order @xmath146 for a sufficiently large @xmath145 . in order to prevent this instability",
    ", we have to add a term of the form @xmath147 to the free energy , which is an allowed term from the underlying symmetry of the problem .",
    "we now want to obtain some restrictions on @xmath148 .",
    "+ first of all , @xmath148 should be such that it prevents the instability .",
    "this gives us a lower bound on the value of @xmath148 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath148 should be small enough so that it should not change the physics significantly .",
    "this gives us an upper bound on the value of @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , we obtain , @xmath149 the above expression is not valid when @xmath3 becomes critical , i.e. when @xmath150 . in this case , we have to compare @xmath3 with @xmath151 .",
    "+ however , when we minimized the free energy in section [ min ] , we did not have to include the above term with a finite @xmath148 as for a sufficiently small @xmath55 , the cutoff in @xmath145 arising from the discrete lattice prevented this instability from showing up .",
    "in general , when we derive the gl equations from the free energy , there is a surface term arising from the gradient terms in the energy which can be ignored in the limit of an infinite system size .",
    "however , for a finite sized system , the boundary term does play an important role .",
    "let us consider only the contribution of the gradient term of the superconducting order parameter in the free energy , in the absence of any nematic order .",
    "then we have , @xmath152 where @xmath153 contains the usual @xmath154 terms . on varying @xmath155 by @xmath156 in @xmath157",
    ", we obtain for a finite system ( up to other variations due to @xmath153 denoted by @xmath158 ) , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the area element , normal to the boundary .",
    "when we solve for @xmath22 in the interior of the region , only the first term contributes and the boundary term can be ignored . however , when we solve for @xmath22 on the boundary , only the surface term plays a role , since it can be thought of as appearing with an infinite weight of the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the radius of the disk on which we are minimizing the free energy and @xmath163 is the dirac - delta function .",
    "therefore , in order to solve for @xmath22 , we have to solve for @xmath164 in the interior of the region subject to the boundary condition @xmath165 ( neumann boundary conditions ) .",
    "+ now in the presence of a constant nematic background ( @xmath166 ) , the gradient term in the free energy is , @xmath167,\\ ] ] where @xmath168 . as we did earlier , on carrying out the variation over @xmath169 this",
    "amounts to solving for @xmath170 subject to the boundary condition , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 in polar coordinates , this condition can be written as , @xmath173=0.\\ ] ]    these boundary conditions mean , in particular , that the current perpendicular to the boundary is zero . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we have used a disk geometry ; therefore the boundaries are found to have a significant effect whenever we are considering a non - circularly symmetric solution , in particular in the regime where the nematic order is non - zero even far away from the core .",
    "we circumvent this problem , however , by taking a sufficiently large system and considering the solution only close to the vortex core , where the boundary effects are small .",
    "in this appendix , we analyze the asymptotics of the field @xmath3 far away from the vortex core in the case @xmath48 , in which the nematic order is critical . in this case , and for @xmath174 , the landau - ginzburg equation for @xmath3 ( eq . [ scaledphi ] ) becomes @xmath175\\phi=0.\\label{eq : phi_critical}\\ ] ] this non - linear equation admits the solution @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "this solution is valid , however , for specific initial conditions , e.g. , @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "physically , the initial conditions for eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_critical ] are determined by the details of the vortex profile at short distances , determined by eq .",
    "[ scaledphi ] .",
    "nevertheless , one can make some general statements about the asymptotic behavior of the solution . if , for some arbitrary @xmath108 such that @xmath179 ( far from the core ) , @xmath3 satisfies @xmath180 , then it is justified to neglect the @xmath138 term in eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_critical ]",
    ". then , the solution close to @xmath108 behaves as @xmath181 , where @xmath107 , @xmath134 are determined by the initial conditions .",
    "this can only be valid , however , up to a point @xmath182 at which @xmath183 , i.e. , at distances which are much smaller than the length scale set by the initial condition of eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_critical ] . at longer distances",
    ", we expect a crossover to @xmath184 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_r ] , we present a numerical solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_critical ] with boundary conditions @xmath185 and various values for @xmath186 . when @xmath177 , we get @xmath187 ( where the deviations are due to the boundary condition at @xmath188 ) . for smaller @xmath186",
    ", there is an intermediate region where @xmath3 does not follow a power law , eventually crossing over to @xmath79 at larger @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37 is approximately logarithmic in the intermediate region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_r]b .",
    "physically , we expect that @xmath189 ( since @xmath190 corresponds to the equilibrium value of @xmath3 in the absence of superconductivity ) .",
