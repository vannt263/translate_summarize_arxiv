    "a fraction of t tauri stars , including tw  hya @xcite , gm  aur @xcite , coku tau/4 @xcite and dm  tau @xcite , present spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that combine little excess flux ( above the photospheric level ) at near - ir wavelengths with robust excesses at @xmath0 .",
    "a similar effect is seen in at least one herbig ae / be star , hd100546 @xcite . since circumstellar discs are generally most optically thick in the inner , hottest regions , this observation is noteworthy and indicative of some process that can create an optically thin inner cavity within the disc .",
    "one exciting possibility is that the cavity arises from the tidal truncation of the inner disc by a massive planet @xcite , in which case the sed observations provide unique constraints on the time scale and frequency of giant planet formation . however , non - planetary explanations are also possible .",
    "dust can grow rapidly to form solid bodies that contribute negligible opacity in any observed waveband , while larger bodies may themselves suffer destructive collisions or rapid orbital decay due to aerodynamic drag against the gaseous disc @xcite .",
    "photoevaporation of the outer disc by ionizing stellar radiation can also starve the inner disc of gas , yielding a short inner hole phase even in the absence of a planet @xcite .",
    "protoplanetary disc models that include some or all of these effects @xcite admit the formation of dusty rings and inner holes , even in the absence of planets and gas . as improved seds and spectra from _",
    "spitzer _ become available , more detailed theoretical study of both classes of model ( pure disc and disc plus embedded planet ) is warranted in order to determine whether these models can be distinguished without direct imaging data .    a sufficiently massive planet ( or brown dwarf ) can probably create an inner cavity in which both the gas and dust surface densities are extremely low . however , of the four aforementioned t  tauri stars  around which inner disc ` holes ' are inferred from the lack of near - ir emission ",
    "only coku tau/4 appears to be entirely devoid of circumstellar material within 1  au of the star . in the case of tw  hya",
    "there is both ongoing low - level gas accretion @xcite , and evidence ( from the existence of a silicate emission feature at 10@xmath1 m ) for a sub - lunar mass of micron sized dust at small radii @xcite .",
    "both gm  aur and dm  tau are classical t tauri stars , with estimated accretion rates on to the stellar photosphere variously estimated at @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately @xcite failed to detect co emission from an inner disc around gm  aur , so there are no observational clues as to the _ gas _ surface density that must accompany this accretion .",
    "however , for these accretion rates protoplanetary disc models predict gas surface densities at @xmath4 of 200 - 2000  g@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "although disc models are subject to large uncertainties arising from the unknown efficiency of angular momentum transport within protoplanetary discs , the robust accretion signatures seen for these stars imply that an inner gas disc must be present .    within a planetary interpretation of the observed seds ,",
    "the presence of inner gas discs and ongoing stellar accretion is not in itself surprising .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that the tidal barrier erected by a massive planet is quite leaky . for jupiter mass planets gas can readily overflow the gap , and",
    "while much of this gas is accreted by the planet in excess of 10% of the accretion rate at large radius can replenish the inner disc and ultimately accrete on to the star @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with gm  aur being a classical t  tauri star , but the lack of dust opacity then requires that the planet needs to be relatively more effective at holding back dust ",
    "i.e. it needs to filter the gas as it passes the tidal barrier . in this paper",
    ", we show that the required filtration may occur as a consequence of the sharp pressure gradient that exists near the outer edge of the gap .",
    "the pressure gradient leads to super - keplerian rotation of the gas , which in turn allows standard aerodynamic coupling to solid bodies @xcite to inject angular momentum and hold back the inward flow of all but the smallest solid particles .",
    "we estimate the efficiency of this process , and argue that it allows relatively low mass planets  which are observed @xcite to be much more common than those planets with @xmath6 that would start to cut off accretion entirely  to nevertheless create dust - poor inner cavities . within this scenario ,",
    "the variation in the observed properties of t  tauri stars with weak near - ir emission could reflect different mass embedded planets  relatively low in the case of gm",
    "aur and dm  tau , and substantially higher in the case of coku tau/4 .",
    "the disc gas and the embedded dust particles interact via a drag force @xcite that is a consequence of the different gas and dust orbital velocities . the keplerian velocity , @xmath7 , at a radius , r , around a star of mass @xmath8 is @xmath9 if @xmath10 is the gas pressure and if @xmath11 is the gas density , the azimuthal component of the gas velocity , @xmath12 , in centrifugal equilibrium differs from the keplerian velocity due to the influence of the gas pressure gradient and is given by @xmath13 the dust particles , on the other hand , are not influenced by pressure forces and , in centrifugal equilibrium , orbit at the keplerian velocity , @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of the drag force depends on the size of the dust particles relative to the mean free path of the gas molecules .",
    "if we assume that the gas is primarily molcecular hydrogen , the mean free path , @xmath14 , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the hydrogen molecule and @xmath17 is its cross - section ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the drag force , @xmath19 is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the relative velocity between the gas and dust particles , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the mean radius of the dust grains and @xmath25 is the drag coefficient , given by @xmath26 in equation ( [ cd ] ) , @xmath27 is the reynolds number which can be shown to be given by ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath28    in general , the gas pressure in protoplanetary discs decreases with increasing radius .",
    "the pressure gradient is therefore negative and the gas velocity is sub - keplerian .",
    "the drag force then acts to slow the dust particles down causing them to spiral in towards the central star .",
    "one can then determine the radial drift velocity of dust particles by self - consistently solving the radial and azimuthal components of the momentum equation as outlined in @xcite .",
    "figure [ radin ] shows an example of the inward radial velocity ( -dr / dt ) against particle radius at @xmath29 au in disc with a density of @xmath30 g @xmath31 and a temperature of @xmath32 k. the radial velocity is clearly strongly dependent on the particle size , and can reach values of @xmath33 cm s@xmath34 .    the inward migration of dust particles , however , only occurs if the the pressure in the disc decreases monotonically with increasing radius . if there are any regions of the disc where the gas pressure increases with increasing radius , the gas velocity will become super - keplerian , and the drag force will cause dust particles to move outwards towards the pressure maxima .",
    "this could occur in the presence of self - gravitating spiral structures @xcite , in the presence of vortices @xcite , or if an embedded planet has opened a gap in the disc @xcite . at the outer edge of a gap opened by a planet ,",
    "the drag force will cause dust particles to migrate up the gap edge , away from the star . if , however , there is still gas accretion through the gap , which is expected for jupiter mass companions around solar - like stars , then dust particles moving too slowly up the gap edge will be dragged by the gas into the gap .",
    "the gap edge will therefore act like a filter , allowing only particles of a certain size through into the inner disc .",
    "even if the inner gas disc has not drained onto the central star , there could still be a substantial difference between the dust populations in the inner and outer disc and this could have a noticeable effect on the disc sed .    to investigate this further , we need an approximation for the pressure gradient at the outer edge of a gap opened by an embedded planet . we therefore perform two - dimensional simulations of gaseous discs with embedded planets to determine the approximate disc structure .",
    "we simulate a planet embedded in a gaseous disc using the zeus code @xcite .",
    "we use two - dimensional coordinates ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) and a resolution of @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the computational domain extends , in code units , from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and we impose ouflow boundary conditions at both @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that the disc is isothermal with a radially dependent sound speed given by @xmath43 .",
    "we adopt units in which @xmath44 and the sum of the mass of the central star and embedded planet is @xmath45 .",
    "since the disc thickness @xmath46 is related to the sound speed through @xmath47 , we have a disc thickness of @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "we model angular momentum transport using a kinematic viscosity , @xmath50 , that operates only on the azimuthal component of the momentum equation @xcite . the initial disc surface density , @xmath51 ,",
    "is taken to have a radial dependence of @xmath52 . since @xmath53 and",
    "since we would expect @xmath54 to be constant we assume that , @xmath55 . we normalise the viscosity using the standard alpha formalism , @xmath56 @xcite , and assume that at @xmath49 , @xmath57 .",
    "the planet is located at @xmath49 and we consider planet masses of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the simulations are evolved for @xmath61 planetary orbital periods .",
    "figure [ plangap ] shows the surface density structure of the simulation with @xmath59 and illustrates that the inner regions of the disc have been significantly depleted .",
    "figure [ surfdens ] shows the surface density profiles for the three different planet masses .",
    "also shown ( dashed line ) is an emperical fit to the gap edge .",
    "the surface density is normalised such that the total disc mass within @xmath62 would be @xmath63 in code units .",
    "it appears that the chosen function is a reasonable fit to the gap edge , especially where the surface density is steepest , which is the region that would have the largest pressure gradient and hence would be the region where the drag force would have the largest influence on the embedded dust particles . from figure",
    "[ surfdens ] a general form for the function representing the gap edge would be @xmath64 \\right\\}^3 , \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the inner radius of the gap edge , and @xmath66 is the gap scalelength . from the fits in figure",
    "[ surfdens ] , the gap scalelength is somewhat greater for @xmath60 than for the lower planet masses , but we assume in general that @xmath67 .",
    "the gap depth itself depends on the value of the coefficient @xmath68 .",
    "a large @xmath68 value results in a deeper gap with a wider edge , and would correspond to a more massive planet .",
    "if we use figure [ surfdens ] as a guide , @xmath69 would correspond to a planet mass of @xmath70 , while @xmath71 would correspond to a planet mass of @xmath60 .",
    "these simulations have all been performed in scale free code units . to convert to real units , we simply need to introduce length and mass scales . for the problem we are considering here",
    "we will generally assume a mass scale of @xmath72 giving a total disc mass of @xmath73 and planet masses of about @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath29 jupiter masses .",
    "the length scale we introduce depends on the assumed semimajor axis of the planet . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will assume a length scale of @xmath76 au , resulting in a semimajor axis of @xmath76 au and , from figure [ surfdens ] , an outer gap edge at @xmath77 au .",
    "to determine how gas drag influences dust particles at the edge of a gap opened by an embedded planet , we need to know the gas pressure gradient . equation ( [ gaussian ] ) gives an approximate form for the surface density structure at the edge of a gap .",
    "the volume density is then , @xmath78 where @xmath79 . the sound speed , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath82 is boltzmann s constant and the temperature , @xmath83 @xcite with @xmath84 .",
    "the pressure is then @xmath85 and the pressure gradient at the gap edge can be determined exactly since we have a fully analytic form for the pressure as a function of radius .",
    "we should , however , note that since the discs we consider here have optically thin inner regions , the outer edge of the gap will intercept more stellar flux and will be hotter than if the inner disc were optically thick @xcite .",
    "a higher temperature will produce a larger pressure gradient .",
    "this temperature increase will , however , decay very quickly within the gap edge , and so may not be significant at the location where the pressure gradient is largest .",
    "even if the temperature is slightly enhanced , a steeper temperature gradient will act to reduce the effect of the increased temperature .",
    "overall we would not expect the effect of the increased temperature at the edge of the gap to be particularly significant .",
    "once the pressure gradient is calculated , the technique described in  [ gasdust ] can then be used to determine the radial velocity of solid particles at any point on the edge of the gap .",
    "the radial velocity of the solid particles will vary considerably along the edge of the gap .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ radvelf8 ] which shows the radial velocity against particle size at the edge of a gap in which , @xmath86 au , @xmath87 au , and @xmath88 . in this case",
    "the radial velocity is positive , as opposed to figure [ radin ] in which the radial velocity is negative .",
    "the surface density in figure [ radvelf8 ] is also normalised such that in the absence of a gap the total disc mass within @xmath89 au would be @xmath90 .",
    "the different curves in figure [ radvelf8 ] correspond to different locations ( i.e. , differents values of @xmath35 ) on the gap edge .",
    "all the curves in figure [ radvelf8 ] have the same form as in figure [ radin ] . at a given location ,",
    "the radial velocity intially increases as the particle size increases until it reaches a peak radial velocity , after which the radial velocity decreases with increasing particle size .",
    "as @xmath35 increases , the curves initially move upwards and the radial velocity increases for all particle sizes ( solid line , small dash line , and dash - dot line ) reaching a maximum when @xmath91 au .",
    "as @xmath35 increases beyond this point ( dash - dot - dot - dot line , and long dash line ) , the curves move to the right ( i.e. , the particle size at which the radial velocity is maximal increases ) , and the maximum radial velocity decreases . the radial velocity for all particles smaller than the particle with the largest radial velocity therefore decreases as @xmath35 increases . beyond the peak of the gap edge ,",
    "the gradient changes sign , the radial velocity changes sign , and solid particles will drift inwards , rather than outwards .",
    "what we wish to determine is the maximum outward radial velocity for particles that would contribute to the sed ( eg . , @xmath92 cm ) .",
    "this can be determined by simply varying @xmath35 until these particles achieve their maximum velocity . in figure [ radvelf8 ] this would correspond to the dash - dot line ( @xmath91 au ) .",
    "the two panels in figure [ radveldrho ] show the maximum outward radial velocity as a function of particle size for two different surface densities and for three different @xmath68 values . in the upper panel",
    "the total disc mass within @xmath89 au would be @xmath93 , while in the lower panel the total mass would be @xmath94 . in both figures",
    "@xmath86 au and @xmath87 au .",
    "the three curves in each figure correspond to @xmath95 , @xmath88 , and @xmath96 .",
    "based on the simulation results shown in figure [ surfdens ] , these could correspond to planet masses of @xmath74 m@xmath97 , @xmath75 m@xmath97 , and @xmath29 m@xmath97 .",
    "the curves in figure [ radveldrho ] show that as @xmath68 , or planet mass , increases , the peak radial velocity moves to smaller particle sizes .",
    "all particles smaller than the peak particle size then have increased radial velocities .",
    "the radial velocities in figure [ radveldrho ] are , however , measured in the frame in which the gas radial velocity is zero .",
    "if there is no accretion ( i.e. the radial gas velocity is zero relative to the central star ) , all particles would be drifting up the gap edge , away from the central star .",
    "if there was some gas accretion , then particles with radial velocities smaller than the radial velocity of the gas will be dragged into the gap .",
    "it is somewhat hard to quantify the radial gas velocity .",
    "the presence of a planet can significantly influence the velocity structure of the gas in the vicinity of the planet @xcite .",
    "we are , however , interested in the radial velocity of the gas as it accretes through the outer edge of the gap .",
    "simulations @xcite show that in general the planet does not influence this material significantly , at least for planets with masses below a few jupiter masses @xcite .",
    "the material that is most influenced by the planet is material that has already accreted into the gap .",
    "most of this material also ends up within the planet s hill sphere , ultimately accreting onto the planet .",
    "the material that we are considering here is material that accretes through the gap into the inner disc , and it appears that this is largely unaffected by the planet , at least in the vicinity of the gap edge .",
    "the gas radial velocity through the edge of the gap will therefore be determined by the disc viscosity , and is related to the mass accretion rate through @xmath98 .",
    "for an accretion rate of @xmath99 the radial gas velocity in the absence of a gap would be @xmath100 cm s@xmath34 for the higher of the surface densities ( upper panel ) in figure [ radveldrho ] and @xmath29 cm s@xmath34 for the lower of the surface densities ( lower panel ) in figure [ radveldrho ] .",
    "if the mass transfer through the gap edge is unaffected by the planet , the radial gas velocity should then increase as the surface density decreases .",
    "when @xmath95 , the surface density when the radial velocity of the particles maximises is @xmath101 times lower than at the peak of the gap edge .",
    "the radial gas velocity should then be @xmath101 times higher , which for the upper panel of figure [ radveldrho ] , and for the mass transfer rate assumed above , would give @xmath102 cm s@xmath34 .",
    "this means that only particles smaller than @xmath103 microns will be swept into the gap by the radial motion of the gas since these particles have outward radial velocities less than @xmath101 cm s@xmath34 . for @xmath96 , the surface density changes by a factor of @xmath104 and , if the same applies , then the radial gas velocity would then be @xmath105 cm s@xmath34 .",
    "the maximum particle size that can populate the inner disc is then @xmath106 microns , comparable to that obtained when @xmath95 .",
    "an equivalent result is obtained if we consider the lower panel in figure [ radveldrho ] .",
    "the surface density being 5 times smaller than in the upper panel results in the particles radial velocities also increasing by a factor of @xmath29 . for a given mass accretion rate ,",
    "however , the radial gas velocity also increases by a factor of @xmath29 and hence the size of particles that would be swept into the gap is roughly indepedent of the assumed surface density .    on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite suggest that the mass accretion rate through a gap actually decreases with increasing planet mass , at least for planets with masses in excess of @xmath75 jupiter mass . in this case",
    "the gravitational torques from the planet act to inhibit flow through the gap @xcite .",
    "the rate of decrease with mass appears to be exponential , with the mass accretion rate decreasing by almost an order of magnitude as the planet mass increases from @xmath75 to @xmath107 jupiter masses .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the size of particles that will be swept into the gap by gas accretion should decrease with increasing planet mass . again considering the upper panel of figure [ radveldrho ] ,",
    "if the three curves correspond to planet masses of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 then we may expect the gas radial velocity to decrease by an order of magnitude as @xmath68 varies from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "the maximum particle size swept into the gap would then decrease by an order of magnitude . for the gas radial velocities considered above",
    ", we might expect the maximum particle size to decrease from @xmath103 microns to a few tenths of a micron as @xmath68 increases from @xmath111 to @xmath112 corresponding to the planet mass increasing from @xmath74 m@xmath97 to @xmath29 m@xmath97 .",
    "since the above process results in only the smallest dust grains being swept into the gap , we would expect the dust to gas mass ratio to be different in the inner disc , compared to the outer disc .",
    "it is , however , difficult to make an independent measurement of the gas and dust masses , and hence determining the different dust to gas mass ratios is probably not possible .",
    "the presence of a silicate feature in protostellar disc spectral energy distributions ( seds ) does , however , depend on the grain size distribution .",
    "the presence of large grains tends to wash out the silicate feature .",
    "as we discuss in the next section , sed modelling of those systems with near infrared deficits suggest that the grain size distribution in the inner disc differs from that in the outer disc in a way that is consistent with dust filtration at a gap edge .",
    "although the suggestion that the observed near - ir deficits in some ttauri seds could result from an embedded jupiter - like planet clearing the inner disc is exciting , there is , as yet , no clear evidence that this is indeed the case .",
    "other non - planetary possibilities , for example rapid grain growth , could also result in optically thin regions that may produce seds largely consistent with that observed .",
    "a sufficiently massive planet does , however , have a real effect on the structure of the gaseous disc which may influence the distribution of solid particles .",
    "this effect could , in turn , influence the nature of the resulting sed .",
    "a @xmath113 jupiter mass planet should open a gap in the disc , the inner region of which could clear to form an inner hole . the outer edge of this gap ( or hole ) will have a pressure that increases with increasing radius , increasing the net outward force on the gas and resulting in super - keplerian gas velocities . the resulting drag force on the solid particles",
    "then results in these particles drifting up the gap edge , away from the central star .",
    "if , however , there is still some gas accretion into the gap - which is expected for @xmath113 jupiter - mass planets @xcite - solid particles with radial velocities smaller than the radial gas velocity will populate the inner region of the disc . for disc properties appropriate for ttauri stars , the radial velocity increases with particle size for particles smaller than @xmath100 cm",
    "this means that only the smallest particles will have outward radial velocities small enough to be dragged into the gap by the accreting gas .",
    "gas accretion through the gap edge therefore acts to filter solid particles , with only the smallest particles making it into the gap .",
    "the exact size range that is influenced by the gas depends on the properties of the gas disc and on the radial gas velocity . assuming a functional form for the gap edge ( motivated by two - dimensional , hydrodynamic simulations of embedded jupiter - like planets )",
    "we show that if the inward gas velocity is @xmath114 cm s@xmath34 , only @xmath113 micron and smaller grains will be able to populate the inner disc . if the gas accretion rate is modified by sufficiently massive planets , as suggested by simulations @xcite , the size of particles that may populate the inner disc should decrease with increasing planet mass .",
    "systems , such as coku tau/4 , that appear to have almost no material in the inner disc may indicate the presence of a massive companion while those , such as gm aur and tw hya , that appear to still have some material in the inner disc , may have a companion with a mass that allows some material to continually replenish the inner disc .",
    "what is attractive about this possibility is that sed modelling suggests that system with near - ir deficits do indeed have two populations of dust particles .",
    "this spatial segregation of dust within discs has been inferred in the tw hya disc @xcite , and radiation transfer models of new spitzer space telescope irs spectra of the coku tau 4 , gm aur and dm tau discs also require inner holes with small grains in the inner disc , and a larger grain population in the outer disc @xcite .",
    "the silicate feature present in the irs spectra provide the clues that the dust grains in the inner disc are smaller than in the outer disc . as more data comes in from spitzer , the number of disc systems showing evidence for inner holes is increasing @xcite . to date ,",
    "most candidates have irac and mips photometry , so only the presence of inner disc clearing can be inferred .",
    "follow up observations with irs will enable us to determine whether the spatial segregation of dust sizes is a common feature and thereby further test our dynamical models for disc - planet interactions and dust filtration .    the sed modelling of systems like gm aur and dm tau not only require a population of small grains in the inner disc , but also require that the mass , or surface density , is also low enough for the inner disc to be optically thin .",
    "accretion onto a planet can reduce the amount of mass reaching the inner disc by up to @xmath115 @xcite , but this is probably insufficient to produce an optically thin inner disc .",
    "typically the optical depth will need to be reduced by a factor of @xmath33 , a factor of @xmath116 more than can be produced by the planet alone . if solid particles are filtered at the gap edge , the amount of mass reaching the inner disc will depend on the size distribution of the solid particles .",
    "interstellar medium ( ism ) grains are generally assumed to have sizes between @xmath117 and @xmath118 and a size distribution of @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "grain growth can however change this distribution quite significantly .",
    "if there is constant replenishment of the ism grains , this can steepen to @xmath120 @xcite , in which case most of the mass will be in small grains . if , however , there is no source of ism grains , the final size distribution can be much flatter , approaching @xmath121 . a relatively shallow size distribution ( e.g. , @xmath122 )",
    "will already have a reduced opacity , independent of the presence of a planet , but , as shown below ( see also figure [ sedgaps ] ) , a further reduction is needed to match the observed seds .",
    "such a reduction can be obtained through the filtration process described here .",
    "the amount of material that can reach the inner disc will depend on the maximum size that can accrete through the gap edge , and on the size distribution of the particles in the outer disc .",
    "figure [ massratfilt ] shows the ratio of the mass of particles smaller than @xmath123 ( solid line ) and @xmath124 ( dashed line ) to the total mass of solid particles , plotted against the exponent of the power - law size distribution . in this figure",
    "we assume a minimum size of @xmath117 and a maximum size of @xmath75 mm . for steep size distributions",
    "most of the mass is in small grains , and even if the maximum size of filtered particles is @xmath123 , the inner disc would remain optically thick .",
    "it is also likely that in this case , grain coagulation would soon produce large grains in the inner disc @xcite . from sed modelling , however , we know that systems like gm aur , tw hya and dm tau must have a size distribution that extend to larger sizes in the outer disc and , since these systems are reasonably evolved , there is unlikely to be a significant new source of ism grains .",
    "we might , therefore , expect the size distribution in the outer disc to be flatter than the ism grain size distribution @xcite .",
    "it has already been shown that in some systems , flatter grain size distribution ( e.g. , @xmath125 ) provide better fits to the seds than ism size distributions @xcite .",
    "figure [ massratfilt ] shows that a size distribution of @xmath126 and a maximum filtered size of @xmath123 , would reduce the mass of solid material accreting through the gap edge by a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "if the planet accretes @xmath115 of this material , the amount of solid material reaching the inner disc would be reduced by a factor of @xmath128 , sufficient to produce an optically thin inner disc .",
    "this process would also produce a very different dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disc , compared with the outer disc .",
    "that systems like gm aur and dm tau have optically thin inner discs but are still accreting at @xmath129 suggests that there is still a substantial amount of gas in the inner disc .",
    "the optically thin inner disc requires a reduction in solid particles of order @xmath128 , while the ongoing accretion requires a far smaller reduction in the amount of gas in the inner disc .",
    "this is at least qualitatively consistent with the suggestion that the solid particles are filtered at the outer edge of the gap which , together with the subsequent accretion onto the planet reduces the mass of solid particles by a factor of @xmath33 , while at least @xmath130 of the gas is allowed through into the inner disc @xcite .",
    "such a reduction in the solid particle surface density in the inner disc also means that subsequent grain coagulation is probably not very important .",
    "@xcite , using a relatively simple one - particle model @xcite , show that at @xmath100 au grain coagulation can produce @xmath131 particles within a few hundred years for reasonable surface densities . if the mass that can be swept up by a growing particle is then reduced by a factor of @xmath128 , one might assume that the maximum size that this particle could achieve is then reduced by a factor of @xmath132 ( i.e. , a maximum size of @xmath133 microns ) .",
    "this , however , is a significant overestimate since the amount of mass swept up by a growing particle depends strongly on the size of the particle , or its collision cross - section . in the simple one - particle model",
    ", there is almost no grain growth if the surface density is reduced by a factor of @xmath128 from an initial density that would be appropriate for the inner regions of a ttauri disc .",
    "although this is a fairly simple model , it at least suggests that if the amount of mass reaching the inner disc is reduced significantly , coagulation should not play an important role in the subsequent evolution of these grains .",
    "figure[sedgaps ] illustrates how the filtration process discussed above may influence the disc seds .",
    "the sed models in figure [ sedgaps ] are computed assuming a 300 au flared disc of total mass @xmath94 that is passively heated by a star with @xmath134 k , and @xmath135 .",
    "the disc surface density and scaleheight have radial profiles of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and the scale height is normalised such that @xmath138 au at @xmath139 au .",
    "the temperature is determined self - consistently by the monte - carlo radiation transfer calculation .",
    "the solid curve is the sed resulting from a dust model with a grain size distribution of @xmath140 with minimum and maximum grain sizes of @xmath117 and @xmath75 mm respectively ( see @xcite , table 1 and figure 3 ) .",
    "the other two models simulate the dust filtration discussed above .",
    "these models have the large grain model in the outer disc ( beyond 5 au ) and ism - like grains ( maximum size @xmath123 ) inside 5 au .",
    "the dashed curve has a depletion factor of @xmath128 for the dust density , while the dotted curve has a depletion factor of @xmath141 , still within the possibilties discussed above .",
    "notice the near - ir deficit and prominent silicate features at @xmath124 and @xmath142 for the sed models with ism - like grains and inner disc depletions .",
    "the redistribution of ir excess from short to long wavelengths for discs with optically thin interiors is also apparent as discussed in @xcite .",
    "these seds are not models for any particular system , but demonstrate the observable signatures of the filtration process we have described . in these models , the dust density in the inner disc is significantly reduced by filtration at the gap edge and by accretion onto the planet , while the gas is only influenced by accretion onto the planet . the gas density in the inner disc",
    "is therefore reduced by a much smaller amount than the dust density .",
    "this extremely small dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disc produces an  opacity gap \" , while still allowing gas accretion onto the star , in line with observations of many t tauri stars that exhibit near - ir deficits in their seds .",
    "it has , however , also been suggested @xcite that  opacity gaps \" and the presence of small grains in the inner disc could actually be evidence for grain growth and subsequent rapid inward migration , rather than inferring the presence of a gap opening planet .",
    "this conclusion was partly because jupiter - like planets in relatively massive discs should migrate into the central star within the disc lifetime @xcite .",
    "although this may indeed be the case , the viscous timescale at @xmath29 au can be @xmath143 years for reasonable viscosity values .",
    "the observation of such a system is therefore still possible , even if the planet ultimately does nt survive the migration process .",
    "if near - ir deficits are due to grain growth , there must also be some means of sharply truncating the grain size distribution at @xmath144 in the inner disc .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing a population of planets that form early , and potentially do not actually survive the migration process .",
    "although we can not definitively conclude that near - ir deficits in the seds of some ttauri stars are a consequence of an embedded jupiter - like planet , that the filtering effect of such a planet - producing a small grain population in the inner disc that differs from the population in the outer disc - is consistent with sed modelling of these systems is suggestive .",
    "the sed modelling also requires that the inner disc be optically thin , while ongoing gas accretion requires that the inner disc still have a substantial amount of gas .",
    "if the grain size distribution is somewhat flatter than the standard ism size distribution @xcite , filtration at the outer gap edge can significantly reduce the amount of solid material reaching the inner disc , while still allowing sufficient gas through the gap .",
    "although we do nt actually know the grain size distribution in the outer discs of those systems that show inner holes , they do show evidence for grain growth . in some cases",
    "flatter size distributions do provide better fits to ttauri seds @xcite , although this has yet to be tested on the systems we consider here . that filtration of solid particles at the outer egde of a gap opened by an embedded jupiter - like planet can produce not only a population of small grains in the inner disc , but",
    "can potentially also make this region optically thin , makes this an attractive possibility .",
    "the filtration process should also lead to an enhancement of larger particles at the peak of the gap edge .",
    "particles exterior to the gap will continue to drift inwards until they reach the gap edge , at which point the change in the gas pressure gradient will prevent the larger particles from drifting any further .",
    "if the surface density of such particles becomes sufficiently high , further planet formation could occur at this location .",
    "since ` hot ' jupiters are thought to form at modest radii and then migrate inwards via type ii migration to their present locations , one may expect in some cases to find additional lower mass planets in 2:1 resonances with these ` hot ' jupiters .",
    "the presence of even terrestrial mass planets in resonant orbits with ` hot ' jupiters could be detected using transit timing @xcite .",
    "although such a detection would be consistent with the analysis presented here , it has been suggested that this could also occur if low - mass , fast migrating planets ( @xmath145 m@xmath146 ) were resonantly trapped by gap opening planets @xcite . in the latter case , however , one may expect the trapped planets to subsequently grow into gas giants @xcite , while in the former case the planetesimal trapping could occur later when there may only be sufficient time for the newly forming planet to reach a terrestrial - like mass .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge interesting discussions with richard alexander , and would like to thank the referee , c.p .",
    "dullemond , for some extremely useful and insightful suggestions .",
