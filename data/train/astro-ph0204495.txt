    "_ chandra _ observations of nearby elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. sarazin , irwin & bregman 2000 ; blanton , sarazin & irwin 2000 ; sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2001 ; finoguenov & jones 2001 ; angelini et al .",
    "2001 ; kraft et al . 2001 ) often find @xmath4 20 x - ray sources with luminosities greater than @xmath5 erg sec@xmath1and even more with luminosities greater than @xmath6 erg sec@xmath1 . for a neutron star ( ns ) accretor",
    ", this corresponds to accretion rates as large as @xmath7 yr@xmath1 , implying a short lifetime compared to the age of the stellar population .",
    "one way to generate such rapid accretion rates in an old stellar population ( neglecting formation of tight binaries in dense environments , such as globular clusters ) is to have a roche lobe - filling binary driven by nuclear expansion of a low - mass star on the red giant branch ( orbital periods are days or longer ) .",
    "ritter ( 1999 ) has shown an analytic solution for such a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , which is further simplified in ellipticals where the initial companion masses should all be @xmath8 for an old population .    however , such wide binaries are subject to thermal instabilities in the accretion disk ( king , kolb & buderi 1996 ; see dubus , hameury & lasota 2001 for an up - to - date discussion ) that cause transient accretion . using the current instability criterion",
    ", we follow the evolution of such an lmxb and find that over 75% of its life is spent as a transient .",
    "we thus expect that a large fraction of the field lmxbs in elliptical galaxies are long - term transients .",
    "our ability to detect them with repeated _ chandra _ observations depends on their outburst durations , which can be as long as years .",
    "we overview the binary evolution scenario in  2 and summarize the challenge of finding the bright , blue optical counterparts to these lmxbs in elliptical galaxies . in  3 , we apply the current understanding of accretion disk instabilities in x - ray sources and estimate the outburst recurrence times . in  4 , we compare our work to galactic systems , noting that the recently discovered galactic transients with outburst durations in excess of ten years ( e.g. wijnands 2002 ) might well be wide binaries .",
    "we close in  5 with our conclusions and a discussion of alternative binary scenarios that lead to more stable mass transfer , especially relevant for those lmxbs found in globular clusters ( sarazin , irwin & bregman 2001 ; angelini , loewenstein & mushotzky 2001 ) .",
    "we only consider binaries with initial orbital periods @xmath91 day .",
    "if the binary is tighter ( @xmath10 day ) , rapid accretion may be initiated due to orbital angular momentum loss from magnetic braking , resulting in mass transfer while a low - mass star is still on the main sequence ( see tauris & savonije 1999 ) .",
    "whenever there are multiple parameters to choose , we always take the value that maximizes the stability of the accretion disk .",
    "this assures that our calculated fraction of the evolutionary lifetime spent as a transient is a firm lower limit .",
    "we use ritter s ( 1999 ) analytical solution for the lmxb evolution , which assumes that the donor star is roche lobe filling on the red giant branch and expanding due to an increasing luminosity . the mass transfer is slow enough that the donor star always remains close to thermal equilibrium ; thus @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radius of the donor star and @xmath13 is the radius of its roche lobe . for simplicity , we assume that mass and angular momentum are conserved , which implies that at the end of the lmxb s evolution the ns ( of mass @xmath14 ) will have a mass of 1.7 - 2.1@xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the initial donor mass is @xmath16 with a population i metallicity , consistent with recent determinations of the age and metallicity of the predominant stellar populations in these elliptical galaxies ( trager et .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "once the evolution is solved , all parameters of the binary can be found in terms of the orbital period at the onset of mass transfer , @xmath17 , which is measured in days , and the donor s mass , @xmath18 , which is measured in solar masses .",
    "the mass transfer rate within the binary is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the initial ns mass and @xmath21 is the total mass of the binary .",
    "since we will show in  3 that the disk is likely unstable , we will not concern ourselves here with the implied super eddington accretion rates at large @xmath17 should this mass transfer rate proceed onto the ns . using equation ( @xmath22 ) the evolution of the binary system",
    "is shown for varying @xmath17 by the solid lines in figure 1 .",
    "the long dashed line is the boundary where the hydrogen envelope of the donor has vanished , halting the evolution at the ending orbital period noted .",
    "the evolving orbital period is @xmath23 shown in figure 2 by the solid lines .",
    "for such an lmxb in an elliptical galaxy , we expect : ( 1 ) the orbit must be wide in order to reach such high @xmath24 s , and ( 2 ) the reprocessing of the x - rays by the large accretion disk should make it a bright , very blue object . at the eddington luminosity , an x - ray binary with @xmath25 days ( much like cygnus x-2 ) has @xmath26 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) and",
    "is blue ( @xmath27 ; van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) . for ngc 4697 ( at a distance modulus of @xmath28 ;",
    "tonry et al . 2001 ) , this corresponds to an apparent v magnitude of 28.4 .    assuming that the lmxb is not associated with a globular cluster , the brightest star which could confuse a search for the optical counterpart would be a red giant branch star just about to reach helium core ignition ( a trgb star ) . for metallicities @xmath29<-1 $ ] , @xmath30 , whereas for @xmath31\\approx -0.7 $ ] , @xmath32 ( saviane et al . 2000 ) . for a slightly metal - rich star (",
    "such as is likely the case for these ellipticals ; trager et al .",
    "2000 ) , the peak brightness is even fainter , @xmath33 ( garnavich et al .",
    "hence , the optical counterpart to a wide lmxb will be brighter at @xmath34 ( and especially so in @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) than any red giant branch star in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the surface brightness of an elliptical galaxy would make such a search difficult in the central regions .",
    "however , beyond @xmath37 2 arcminutes , the surface brightness at @xmath34 ( in ngc 4697 , for example ) is below the sky level ( for hst ) of 22 - 23 @xmath38 ( goudfrooij et al .",
    "1984 ) . in that limit , and using the measured _ chandra _ position of sources at such locations , such a wide ( 10 day ) binary would be detectable at b or v in a @xmath39 observation with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ on hst .",
    "of course , such optical counterparts are easy to find in the nearby bulge of m31 , where @xmath40 .",
    "if the disk is thermally stable and transfers matter to the ns at the supplied rate , there is nearly a one - to - one relation between @xmath17 and the x - ray luminosity ( see figure 1 ) that would allow the orbital period distribution to be inferred from the luminosity distribution ( webbink et al .",
    "1983 ) . however , this argument fails because these wide binaries are almost always transient accretors .",
    "the usual condition used for the disk instability is that some portion of the disk is below the hydrogen ionization temperature ( @xmath41 k ) . since the effective temperature of the disk decreases with increasing radius , it is usually adequate to check that the outer radius of the disk is below the critical temperature . in x - ray binaries , however , this temperature is fixed by irradiation from the central accreting source ( van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "the surface temperature is then estimated as ( dubus et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the disk radius , @xmath44 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath45 is the conversion efficiency for accretion onto the ns , and @xmath46 measures the fraction of the x - ray luminosity that reaches the disk ( and contains information on the irradiation geometry ) .",
    "we take @xmath47 ( slightly larger than the preferred value , @xmath48 of dubus et al .",
    "2001 ) so as to maximize the persistent fraction .",
    "the disk is assumed to extend out to 70% of the roche lobe around the ns ( king et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "setting @xmath49 k allows us to solve for the critical time , accretion rate , and orbital period at which the instability sets in as a function of the donor s mass .",
    "the critical mass transfer rate is then @xmath50 which is used for the instability boundary shown in figures 1 and 2 as the dotted line .",
    "the critical orbital period is @xmath51 and this is used for the instability boundary in figure 2 .",
    "the fraction of time spent transient is then found ( numerically to better than a percent ) as a function of the initial orbital period , @xmath52 where @xmath53 . for @xmath17 in excess of a day , the binary is transient at least @xmath3 of the time , and this does not include binaries containing black holes which are transient almost all the time ( e.g. king et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we estimate a maximum recurrence time for outbursts by assuming the outside - in model .",
    "we assume that the binary is quiescent until a critical surface density in the outer accretion disk ( at radius @xmath43 ) has been reached ( dubus , hameury , & lasota 2001 ) , @xmath54 where we assume that the viscosity parameter @xmath55 and that there is no irradiation of the disk in quiescence .",
    "this expression gives a maximum recurrence time @xmath56 that should be viewed with some caution given the uncertainties in the accretion disk physics .",
    "this recurrence time is @xmath57 100 - 10,000 years ( depending on the initial orbital period ; see figure 2 ) and is consistent with current estimates from observations of galactic ms radio pulsar / he white dwarf binaries ( ritter & king 2002 ) . our estimate is maximal because it is possible ( and maybe even likely ) that the lmxb may outburst before the outer disk reaches the critical mass , such as an outburst initiated in the inner disk .",
    "one difficulty with comparing these evolutionary models with observations is the lack of long orbital period lmxbs in our galaxy .",
    "many persistent sources have low enough orbital periods ( @xmath58 hours ) that they are probably not accurately described by the evolutionary model used above . however , a lack of persistent sources at @xmath59 day is in agreement with our calculations and generally expected from previous work ( for example king , frank , kolb & ritter 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that such ns binaries spend most of their lifetime as transient rather than persistent sources ( @xmath60 of the time ) .",
    "though all these relations are consistent , it is still hard to claim that the instability criterion has been fully scrutinized by the galactic population .",
    "indeed , the outburst durations of these systems might be so long that they appear to us as `` persistent '' sources ( with accretion rates most likely in excess of the mass transfer rate expected from binary evolution ) until they suddenly disappear . indeed , one such source ( and maybe others ; wijnands 2002 ) has now been clearly identified : ks  1731 - 260 ( wijnands et al . 2001",
    "; rutledge et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it was accreting at @xmath61 for at least a decade prior to its sudden decline in luminosity by a factor of @xmath62 ( rutledge et al .",
    "analysis of the immediate quiescent emission in terms of thermal emission from the ns surface yielded constraints on the recurrence time from 300 - 1,000 years ( wijnands et al . 2001 ; rutledge et al .",
    "until this system s orbital period is found ( current knowledge of the infrared counterpart points to a possibly evolved companion ; orosz , bailyn & whitman 2001 ) we will not be able to say whether it is an lmxb of the type we are discussing .",
    "however , its existence does point to a likelihood of finding such similar systems in elliptical galaxies .",
    "one galactic binary that does have a long orbital period is gro j1744 - 28 ( 11.8 days ; finger et al .",
    "this system is transient and was shown by bildsten and brown ( 1996 ) to have a companion with mass @xmath63 and core mass ( if the companion is a population i metallicity star ) .",
    "when this binary s evolutionary path is predicted and plotted , it is found to be transient ( as it is ) with a maximum outburst recurrence time of ( see dot - dashed line in figure 2 ) , consistent with a single outburst .",
    "we have shown that the expected mass transfer scenario for low mass x - ray binaries in the field of an elliptical galaxy ( where the donors must be @xmath64 ) that yield @xmath65 ( as observed by _ chandra _ ) have thermally unstable disks .",
    "such binaries are expected to be transient accretors with maximum recurrence times of 100 - 10,000 years for at least @xmath3 of their lifetimes .",
    "when active , it appears likely that they would easily reach the ns s eddington limit .",
    "our inability to calculate the duration of the bright outbursting phase makes it difficult to predict how many such transients will be identified in repeated _ chandra _ visits .",
    "if the duty cycle is bright for ten years out of a thousand ( like implied for ks 1731 - 260 ; rutledge et al . 2002 ) , and there are 100 such binaries , then a year later , roughly 10 would have faded into quiescence to be replaced by new transients .",
    "this is not that far off from what was seen over a five month interval in cen a ( kraft et al . 2001 ) , where four sources ( out of 120 exposed in both epochs ) were either non - detectable ( @xmath66 ) or appeared bright ( @xmath67 ) in either epoch .",
    "there were a larger number ( @xmath68 ) which showed significant variability ( kraft et al . 2001 ) .",
    "such comparisons are also complicated by the discovery that many of the x - ray sources in ellipticals are coincident with gcs ( sarazin et al .",
    "2001 ; angelini et al . 2001",
    "; white , sarazin & kulkarni 2002 ) . other possible accretion scenarios then include accretion from lower - mass main sequence stars that are formed in this dense stellar environment ( see rasio , pfahl & rappaport 2000 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "these tight systems would most likely be persistent accretors , thus apparently reducing the fraction of transients amongst the detected sources .",
    "this might just be an impression however , as if the duty cycle of the field transients is really 1% , then the underlying population is indeed larger than that in gcs .",
    "namely , it is possible that the gc population is only _ apparently _ a large fraction because lmxbs in gcs are persistently bright .",
    "the census of the much more numerous population of field transients can only be taken over a few thousand years .",
