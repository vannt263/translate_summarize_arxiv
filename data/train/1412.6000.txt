    "this being the case , we can trace away the gravitational part in ( [ q - mat ] ) and obtain an equation for the matter part only : @xmath21 where @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the point first observed in @xcite and further analysed in @xcite , is that equation ( [ final ] ) resembles the schroedinger equation for a quantum field @xmath8 on a suitably defined _ classical _ spacetime .",

    "we can then identify two effective flrw metrics : the low - energy one @xmath49 and the @xmath2-dependent one @xmath50 we can interpret @xmath51 as the metric measured by a classical observer , while scalar field ( and especially its relativistic modes ) propagate on @xmath52 .",
    "are meaningful .",
    "we identify unambiguously this family as the cosmological ( i.e. , comoving ) observers of the metric @xmath51 .",
    "the reason to consider such observers as `` classical '' is the following : if such an observer only performs measurement of geodesics of macroscopic bodies ( for which @xmath41 , @xmath2 being the momentum she measures ) , she will only investigate the regime in which @xmath53 , therefore concluding that the spacetime is described by @xmath51 . +",
    "a mathematical description of the situation is the following : there exists a manifold whose homogeneous and isotropic metric is @xmath51 ; semiclassical observers coincide with cosmological observers of this metric ; if the momentum @xmath2 of a particle as measured by such observers is non - negligible compared to the mass @xmath6 , then such particle obeys a dispersion relation with @xmath52 . ]",
    "suppose that an observer with 4-velocity @xmath54 detects a particle with 4-momentum @xmath55 .",

    "the particle satisfies the mass - shell relation in _ its _ metric ( [ metrick ] ) : @xmath59 having introduced the so - called `` rainbow functions '' @xcite @xmath60 from ( [ low - k - lim ] ) it is immediate to compute @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which explicitly depend on the physical momentum @xmath63 : @xmath64 we thus obtain a modified dispersion relation from ( [ massshell ] ) , @xmath65 as expected , the standard dispersion relation @xmath66 is recovered in the limit @xmath67 . the first correction in the case",
    "@xmath68 is precisely @xmath7 , a quantity of exquisitely quantum gravitational origin .",
    "note that  contrary to the general belief  no particular role is played by planck energy , @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , for a highly quantum spacetime we have @xmath70 , and hence the particles probe the quantum structure of spacetime already at @xmath68 . for a proton",
    ", this would correspond to mild energies of order @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath72 for semiclassical states , and hence quantum gravity corrections are irrelevant for low - energy particles .",
    "we should mention that a similar result was recovered in the semiclassical limit in @xcite .",
    "having the dispersion relation , it is possible to compute the velocity of the mode : @xmath73 this expression only holds in the limit @xmath67 , but it is enough to show the deformation already at low energies . the exact dispersion relation ( obtained numerically from ( [ goodgod ] ) ) is represented in figures 1 and 2 , where the classical one ( @xmath72 ) is compared with the choice @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath75 ( a highly non - classical situation ) . in figure 2",
    "we also show the dispersion relation for massless particles : there is no dependence of velocity of light on @xmath5 ( though there is still a dependence on @xmath7 , and hence on time ) . to see why this happens , consider the limit @xmath76 of ( [ goodgod ] ) .",
    "it leads to @xmath77 , \\ \\",

    "the massless scalar field case was first studied in @xcite , and @xmath79 of ( [ high - energy - metric ] ) coincides with the result therein .",
    "now , since @xmath79 is independent of @xmath2 , the metric seen by particles with @xmath78 is @xmath2-independent ( though different from the semiclassical metric , @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that no mode - dependence is found in the velocity of light particles .",
    "this can be made explicit by computing the dispersion relation for such field : plugging @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the general formula ( [ disprel ] ) with @xmath78 , we derive @xmath82{\\frac{\\langle \\hat{h}_o^{-1 } \\rangle}{\\langle \\widehat{h_o^{-1 } { a^6 } } \\rangle } } \\ p = \\sqrt{1 + \\beta } \\ p\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , as far as massless particles are concerned , the effect of the quantum background amounts to a constant shift in the velocity of light .",
    "while this effect can not be detected by any local measurement , we stress that the derivation was done for a massless scalar field , and might well be different in the case of photons .     for a scalar field of mass @xmath6 .",

    "the dashed lines represent the speed of light in the semiclassical spacetime ( black ) and in the quantum spacetime ( green ) respectively.,height=211 ]    [ fig : vels2 ]    in conclusion , our analysis shows that the quantum nature of cosmological spacetime unavoidably affects the propagation of test particles , producing ( apparent ) lorentz - violating effects .",
    "this has been shown by constructing an effective metric from general assumptions ( in particular , we did not need to restrict to a specific quantum theory of cosmology ) .",
    "intuitively , the generality of the result can be understood by observing that  independently of the chosen quantum theory ",
    "the quantum state @xmath0 of the homogeneous gravitational field is not an eigenstate of the `` scale factor operator '' in general .",
    "hence , it is to be expected that matter particles of different momenta @xmath5 will couple differently to the quantum geometry , probing different aspects of it . in the present work ,",
    "we have used a massive scalar field @xmath8  one of the simplest forms of matter  but there is no reason not to expect the same qualitative behaviour for other species .",
    "as for the characterization of this effect , we have shown that the only parameter governing the corrections is @xmath7 , a single function of @xmath0 .",
    "this is rather striking , considering that infinitely many quantum states can be found that give the same value @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    ", we should not be too surprised , since the same happens for photons propagating in refractive media : the scattering of light through a crystal is perfectly well described in terms of the refractive index @xmath83 , a single parameter in spite of the infinitely many possible microscopic configurations of the atoms .",
    "moreover , we should stress that the current results are based on a homogeneous quantum background : it is possible that inclusion of inhomogeneities might invalidate this result , but it is also conceivable that it will make it even more interesting ( for instance , @xmath7 might depend on the position , as does the refractive index of a non - homogeneous medium ) .    but",
    "how strong is this effect ?",
    "how big is @xmath7 ?",
    "while there is no _ fundamental _ reason why @xmath7 should be small , it is an _ observational fact _ that the universe today is classical .",
    "this means that the state @xmath0 describing the current geometry of spacetime must be a coherent state with @xmath7 extremely small @xcite .",
    "our philosophy is therefore to use @xmath7 as a test for the soundness of coherent states within a specific quantum cosmology or  in case no good coherent state can be found  as an indicator that said theory of quantum cosmology is incorrect .    while @xmath72 today , several quantum gravity and quantum cosmology theories maintain that in the early stages of its life , the universe should be described by a non - classical state . in this case @xmath70 , and the modified dispersion relations have to be taken into account when studying the behaviour of primordial matter .",
    "we can expect that traces of such effects are left on the cmb , or even speculate that they might have played a role in inflation and subsequent formation of structures .",
