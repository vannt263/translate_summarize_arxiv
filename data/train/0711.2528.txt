    "it is known that hadronic cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium ( ism ) can produce @xmath0-rays and leptons .",
    "the principal production mechanisms for @xmath0-rays in high - energy astrophysics are inelastic cr+ism interactions with subsequent decays of the secondaries ( mostly the neutral @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) into @xmath0-rays .",
    "the decays of charged @xmath3 mesons and other secondaries will result in the production of high - energy neutrinos and secondary leptons , electrons and positrons . in gev - scale galactic cosmic rays ,",
    "the secondary electrons and positrons comprise around 20% of the total electron flux and significantly contribute to the non - thermal electromagnetic radiation of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the flux of cosmic - ray neutrinos is determined by the cosmic - ray abundance and the production cross sections of the parent particles ( @xmath4 ) in the collisions of cosmic - rays with the interstellar gas nuclei .",
    "the purpose of this work is to carefully calculate the lepton production in cosmic - ray interactions . for this purpose",
    "we use the high - energy physics event generator dpmjet - iii @xcite to simulate all secondary productions in both p - generated and he - generated interactions , similar to earlier work on hadronic @xmath0-ray production @xcite .",
    "our study includes direct lepton production and the decays of all relevant secondary particles with leptons as the final decay products . for the cosmic rays , protons and helium nuclei",
    "are taken into account .",
    "we assume the composition of the ism as 90% protons , 10% helium nuclei , 0.02% carbon , and 0.04% oxygen . at energies below 20 gev , where dpmjet appears unreliable , we combine the simulation results with parametric models for @xmath3 and @xmath1 production @xcite that include the production of the resonances @xmath5(1232 ) and @xmath5(1600 ) and their subsequent decays , thus deriving a lepton production matrix for cosmic rays with energies up to about 10 pev that can be easily used to interpret the spectra of cosmic lepton sources .",
    "we use our production matrices to calculate the cr - induced electron / positron production in young shell - type supernova remnants ( snr ) , for which the neutrino fluxes are also calculated .",
    "observations of non - thermal x - ray synchrotron radiation from the snrs sn  1006 @xcite , rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , ic 443 @xcite , cas a @xcite , and rcw 86 @xcite support the hypothesis that the galactic cosmic - ray electrons may be accelerated predominantly in snr , although other acceleration sites of high - energy electrons might exist in the galaxy .",
    "the existence of electrons in snrs with an energy up to about 100 tev implies tev - scale @xmath0-ray emission @xcite besides that possibly produced by hadronic cosmic rays , and tev - scale gamma - rays have indeed been detected from the snrs vela junior @xcite and rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite .",
    "although the hadronic interpretation is often favored to explain the @xmath0-ray emission from snrs such as rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , there is still no direct observational evidence for nucleon acceleration in snrs @xcite .",
    "currently , both hadronic and leptonic models can describe the observed tev @xmath0-rays in different astrophysical objects , but have problems of similar magnitude @xcite .",
    "rx j1713.7 - 3946 is a unique snr in the sense that its x - ray emission is strongly dominated by a non - thermal component , which is presumed to be synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons ( see references @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "the recent broadband x - ray spectroscopy performed with chandra @xcite and the suzaku experiment @xcite provides evidence of very effective acceleration of particles in the shell of rx j1713.7 - 3946 and also reveals that the x - ray emission from two compact regions is variable in flux , which the authors interpret as indication of multi - mg magnetic fields .",
    "if this conclusion is correct and applies to the entire remnant , then the observed tev - band @xmath0-ray emission must be of hadronic origin . here",
    "we show that the synchrotron flux from the secondary electrons in rx  j1713.7 - 3946 would in fact exceed the observed radio flux from this object , if multi - mg magnetic fields would permeate the remnant , so a magnetic field of such magnitude will likely exist at most in a small fraction of emission region .    in a hadron accelerator , tev neutrinos",
    "should be produced in roughly the same number as tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the universe is generally more transparent for high - energy neutrinos than for tev and pev @xmath0-rays , that can be absorbed by pair production with either the microwave background ( cmb ) or the infrared / optical photon background ( irb ) .",
    "therefore the detection of astrophysical neutrinos can provide invaluable complementary information on the existence of hadronic processes at astrophysical objects . here",
    "we calculate the observable tev - scale neutrino flux from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 and other sources .",
    "this is not the first attempt to do such work .",
    "in fact , several calculations of the expected @xmath0-ray and neutrino spectra were made for parametrized hadronic particles in the energy range of neutrino detectors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the earlier works , we include all relevant channels of neutrino production and also we do not rely on assuming a simple power - law proton spectrum or a power - law with an exponential cutoff , because our neutrino production matrix can be applied to energetic particles with arbitrary spectrum .",
    "this work uses the same method to determine the @xmath0-ray production matrix for the cosmic - ray hadronic interactions as published earlier for @xmath0-ray production @xcite , namely applying the monte - carlo event generator , dpmjet - iii @xcite , to simulate the secondary production in cosmic - ray interactions .",
    "the readers are referred to reference @xcite for the details of this technique .",
    "all secondary particles produced in simulated hadronic interactions are recorded while running the event generator dpmjet - iii .",
    "the following decay modes show all the decay processes of secondary products with leptons as the final decay particles , that are taken into account .",
    "stable leptons considered in this work are @xmath6 .",
    "note that the lifetime of neutrons is about 886 s , much shorter than the propagation time scale of cosmic - ray particles in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the neutrons are treated as having decayed entirely in this work .",
    "the decay channels considered in this work are as follows .",

    "induced @xmath0-ray production @xcite , we have verified that the @xmath2 mesons are properly accounted for by performing test runs under different pythia parameters , for which the @xmath2 decays can be avoided in the simulation .",
    "we have also performed another independent verification using the very small contribution to @xmath32 and @xmath33 pairs from @xmath2 decays , which are found consistent within the statistical uncertainty with all @xmath2 mesons having decayed .",
    "the @xmath3 decays and subsequent @xmath34 decays via the @xmath35 decay chain are dominant in cosmic - ray interactions because pions carry the highest multiplicity among all the secondaries .",
    "we ignore neutrino production by charmed particles such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , because they contribute only at @xmath38 100 tev @xcite , where they are ignorable compared with neutrino production by pions . in the case of decays of moving @xmath3 s , the @xmath39 energy is roughly equally divided among the four decay products , and thus the flux ratios are approximately @xmath40 and @xmath41 , no matter what the @xmath39 spectrum is . in reality , however , these neutrino ratios may vary on account of the decays of heavier baryons and mesons .",
    "an excess of @xmath42 multiplicity arises because more @xmath43 s than @xmath44 s are produced , and so the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 are somewhat increased .",
    "for the two - body decay processes , the decay spectra are evaluated by particle kinematics ; for the electrons / positrons from muon decays , the decay spectra are calculated by lorentz transformation of the particle distribution in the center - of - mass system of the muon @xcite , which also includes the effect of the @xmath47 polarization @xcite ; for kaon decays and heavy nucleon decays , the dalitz - plot distribution is applied .",
    "the values published in particle data group are employed for the fraction of each individual decay process .      in our earlier work on @xmath0-ray production",
    "@xcite we already found that dpmjet is unreliable below a few gev collision energy . at these energies",
    "we therefore use a parametric model @xcite to calculate the resultant decay spectra of @xmath0 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . for the decay of the resonances @xmath53 and @xmath54 we assume the pion momentum to be isotropically distributed in the center - of - mass system and no angular correlation between the two pions in @xmath54 decay .    note that the parametric model for pion and resonance production at low incident energies is for pp interactions only .",
    "we then use dpmjet to calculate the energy - dependent weight factors , which allow us to parametrically account for p+ism and he+ism collisions in the parametrization approach , even though it is derived for pp collisions only .",
    "the weight factors carry no strong dependence on the energy of the projectile particle .",
    "the differential production rate of a final secondary particle is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 as the differential density of cr particles ( p or @xmath57 ) .",
    "the differential cross section of a secondary particle produced in ( p,@xmath57)-ism collisions is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the inelastic production cross section , i.e. , the sum of diffraction , non - diffraction and resonance components whose values are calculated by dpmjet and the parametric model ; @xmath60 is the multiplicity spectrum of the secondary particle in question .",
    "we follow the decay of unstable secondary particles to stable particles , and thus obtain the final spectrum of the stable secondaries @xmath0-rays , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the multiplicity spectrum of stable particle species @xmath65 resulting from production channel @xmath66 , either an unstable secondary or direct production . for binned particle spectra the production integral , eq",

    "( [ eq : productionmatrix ] ) accounts for the specific element abundance in the ism assumed 90% h , 10% he , 0.04% o and 0.02% c here .",
    "please note that the ratio of the @xmath0-ray and neutrino yields is indepedendent of @xmath71 .",
    "the main product of our work is the production matrix @xmath72 that describes the production spectrum of the stable secondary particles , one for each , for arbitrary cosmic - ray spectra , separately for protons and helium nuclei .",
    "with the production matrix established for each stable particle , we are now in the position to calculate the production spectra of secondary leptons and neutrinos in a variety of sources . as an example we here consider young shell - type snrs .",
    "being associated with dense gas along the line - of sight , the shell - type snr rx  j1713.7 - 3946 could provide significant information on the acceleration of hadronic cosmic - rays .",
    "in addition , rx j1713.7 - 3946 is also a unique supernova remnant in the sense that its x - ray emission is strongly dominated by a non - thermal component , which is presumed to be synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons",
    ". these electrons also produce tev - band gamma - rays , but would require a relatively small magnetic field to account for the tev - band @xmath0-ray spectrum observed with hess @xcite .",
    "the recently observed rapid variability of x - rays of rx j1713.7 - 3946 has been interpreted as evidence of a multi - mg magnetic field @xcite , in which case the leptonic scenario would be untenable .",
    "we can test this interpretation by calculating the synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons in this remnant . in an earlier paper",
    "we have determined the cosmic - ray spectrum in rx  j1713.7 - 3946 under the assumption that the observed tev - band spectrum is hadronic in origin @xcite . using our newly derived production matrix for secondary electrons and positrons",
    ", we can determine the differential production rate of those particles which , together with a time - dependent cosmic - ray continuity equation , allows us to calculate the radio synchrotron radiation of the secondary electrons with mainly the magnetic field strength as a fully free parameter .",
    "our fit of the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum constrains only the strongly curved cosmic - ray spectrum in the 1 - 100  tev energy range .",
    "however , synchrotron emission in the ghz range is produced by gev - scale electrons and we do not know how the spectrum continues down to gev energies .",
    "so for simplicity , we match a single - power - law spectrum to the multi - tev spectrum of cosmic - ray nucleons that we derive from fitting the hess data , @xmath73 where the parameters in equation  ( [ eq : spectrarxj1713.7 - 3946 ] ) are derived by fitting the observed tev - band @xmath0-ray spectrum of rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite . in this parametrization",

    "@xmath77 is the cut - off energy , and the best - fitting parameter values are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80  tev .",
    "@xmath81 is the overall normalization , determined by the integral spectrum of @xmath0-rays above 1 tev @xcite .",
    "if a numerical value of @xmath57 is set , the normalization @xmath82 and the merging energy @xmath83 are fully determined by the two continuity conditions that link the two spectral forms ( [ eq : spectrarxj1713.7 - 3946 ] ) and ( [ eq : crspectralowe ] ) .",
    "models of particle acceleration in cosmic - ray modified shocks suggest that the spectral index @xmath57 should be slightly smaller than 2 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath57 denotes the average particle spectral index between about 1  gev and 10  tev .",
    "the combined cosmic - ray spectrum together with our production matrices for electrons and positrons then yields the differential production rate of secondary leptons that is implied by the @xmath0-ray spectrum observed from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "secondary electrons have been accumulated in the remnant since it commenced hadron acceleration . to determine the synchrotron radiation of the secondary electrons ,",
    "we must obtain the electron spectrum in the snr by solving a simplified time - dependent electron transport equation : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the time after supernova explosion and the electron energy loss rate is that for synchrotron radiation @xmath86 with @xmath87 as the energy density of the magnetic field and @xmath88 as the thomson cross section .    the likely distance",
    "to rx  j1713.7 - 3946 is 1  kpc and the implied age would be about 1,600 years @xcite .",
    "an alternative kinematic solution places the remnant at about 6  kpc in distance with implied age of 10,000  years @xcite .",
    "whatever the acceleration history of the remnant is , cosmic - ray particles which have been accelerated early in its evolution will have lost some of their energy by adiabatic expansion , with most of it happening very early in the evolution . to be conservative",
    "we therefore consider only half of the remnant age , during which we assume the differential production rate of secondary electrons , @xmath89 , to be constant and given by our production matrix and the cosmic - ray spectrum as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectrarxj1713.7 - 3946 ] ) and ( [ eq : crspectralowe ] ) @xmath90 then the spectrum of secondary electrons or positrons is obtained by integrating the green function and the source term over time and energy : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the electron cooling time . for high energies @xmath93 and the spectrum is loss - limited , i.e. essentially steepened by 1 in the spectral index , whereas at low energies the production spectrum is preserved .",
    "note that the synchrotron flux calculated using the electron spectrum ( [ eq : electronpopulation ] ) is absolutely normalized by the tev @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "figure [ fig : synchspectracr180 ] shows an example of the synchrotron spectrum from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 that is contributed by secondary electrons assuming a distance of 1 kpc , the age as 1,600 years , and the power - law index @xmath94 for the multi - gev cosmic - ray nucleon spectrum .",
    "the synchrotron spectra for three different values of the magnetic fields , @xmath95 @xmath47 g , are shown in comparison with the observed x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite data . at higher frequencies",
    "the synchrotron power is always about half the tev - band @xmath0-ray power on account of the equal likelihood of neutral and charged pions being produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission is therefore always contributed by primary electrons .    to be noted from the figure",
    "is that for a field strength of 2  mg the radio synchrotron flux is similar to the observed flux , so the primary electrons must be very few because they would contribute only the remaining fraction of the observed radio flux , thus further lowering the @xmath96 ratio in accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "this limit is much more severe , if the distance to rx  j1713.7 - 3946 is more than 1  kpc , and the age correspondingly more than 1,600  years .",
    "it is also more severe , if the effective gev - to - tev spectral index of cosmic - ray nucleons in the source is softer , @xmath97 , and it is relaxed in the opposite case .",
    "one should note that in mg - fields ghz - band synchrotron emission is emitted by electrons with about 300  mev kinetic energy , i.e. below the relativistic transition .",
    "the effective spectral index must be measured by comparing the @xmath98  gev flux and the @xmath99  tev flux of cosmic - ray nucleons , which is considerably softer than the local spectral index near 1  tev .",
    "measurements of the radio synchrotron of a large number of shell - type snrs indicate that in the gev band , the spectral index is locally around 2 @xcite , whereas at 1 - 10  tev the local spectral index should be closer to 1.5 @xcite , so on average we may expect @xmath100 . consequently , a multi - mg magnetic field is unlikely to exist in a large fraction of the synchrotron emission region or @xmath57 must be significantly smaller than 1.8 ( i.e. , the spectrum is harder ) .",
    "this result is conservative , because we are ignoring secondary electrons that were produced in the first half of the time since the sn explosion .",
    "the recent observation of rapid variability of x - rays of rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite has been interpreted as evidence for the notion that the magnetic field of the hot spots ( two compact regions ) could be as large as mg level .",
    "these compact regions are in only a few arcseconds and likely present transient acceleration sites of high - energy electrons .",
    "our calculations shows that , if such strong magnetic field exists in snr shell , they are unlikely to fill the entire remnants .",
    "table 1 summarizes the limits on the averaged magnetic - field strength for various values of the effective gev - to - tev spectral index of cosmic - ray nucleons and different values for the age of rx  j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the contribution of synchrotron radiation by secondary electrons is compared with the integrated flux density 20 jy at 1.4 ghz , which is the result of @xcite for the nw region but scaled to the entire remnant with a factor 3 based on the angular distribution of tev gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this scaling factor carries a sizable uncertainty not less than 30% , largely owing to systematic uncertainty in the background subtraction in the radio data .",
    "some similar works @xcite have used a scaling factor of 2 for the entire remnant .",
    "high - energy cosmic neutrinos are inevitably produced in parallel with hadronic @xmath0-rays .",
    "therefore , tev - band @xmath0-ray sources represent the prime targets to search for cosmological neutrinos .",
    "several calculations on the expected @xmath0-ray and neutrino spectra were made for parametrized spectra of hadronic particles in the energy range of neutrino detectors , @xmath101 @xcite , usually by assuming a simple power - law proton spectrum or a power - law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "in contrast , our neutrino production matrix can be applied to cosmic - ray nucleon spectra of any form .",
    "also , the particle yields in the parameterizations can be underestimated because they are often based only on the pion channels .",
    "our production matrix accounts for all relevant decay processes in cosmic - ray hadronic interactions .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : espectragammamunurxj1713.7 - 3946 ] , we find that using the same cosmic - ray spectrum , our production matrix gives about 15 - 20% more @xmath0-rays at all energies .",
    "our production matrix also yields an approximately 30% more muon neutrinos than the parametric model @xcite after full mixing .",
    "the excess of @xmath0-rays and neutrinos in this figure agrees with the conclusion of our earlier study @xcite , which has considered the full picture of @xmath0-ray production in hadronic interactions and indicated about 20% more hadronic @xmath0-rays relative to @xmath0-rays from @xmath1 decays alone .",
    "also note that @xmath2-decays contribute about 8 - 10% and kaons also have roughly the same contribution @xcite .",
    "only a few percent of @xmath0-rays are contributed by other decay processes ( together with the direct @xmath0-ray production ) . for a given @xmath0-ray or neutrino flux",
    ", our production matrix therefore implies a lower flux of cosmic - ray nucleons than estimated using the parametric models @xcite .    in high - energy hadronic interactions , the resulting initial @xmath102 flavor ratio from @xmath39 decays",
    "is @xmath103 however , the neutrino oscillations transform this ratio to 1:1:1 , i.e. , full mixing , because the snr size of @xmath104 10 pc implies a substantial range of neutrino path lengths , wider than the neutrino oscillation wavelength @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect the @xmath61 spectrum arriving at earth to be about 1/3 of the total @xmath106 .",
    "the resulting @xmath61 spectrum is only weakly dependent of the relative fraction of @xmath49 s and @xmath61 s at the source .",
    "other studies @xcite have calculated high - energy neutrinos from galactic sources considering the actual neutrino mixing angles for point sources . for a comparison of the neutrino source functions by our production matrix and the parametric model @xcite",
