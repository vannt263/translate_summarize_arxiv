    "[ fig8 ] shows the @xmath89-dependence of the conductance for two fillings @xmath24 , chosen below and above @xmath243 , respectively .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first , the limit @xmath244 seems to result in a finite conductance .",
    "this may come as a surprise , since in the absence of interactions , we know that @xmath77 must hold .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that our hf approach in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] applies only if the frequency scale @xmath245 at which the conductance is probed remains well below the effective bandwidth of the zero mode .",
    "since this @xmath22 bandwidth is proportional to @xmath89 , it vanishes in the limit @xmath244 , and the @xmath246 limit implicit in eq .   can not be taken anymore .",
    "second , the different @xmath89-dependence at the two fillings observed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] simply reflects the fact that @xmath243 increases with increasing @xmath89 , cf .  the main panel .",
    "this shift of @xmath243 in turn can be rationalized by noting that the chemical potential also moves up with increasing @xmath89 , and thus the cancellation point between the @xmath227 and @xmath39 contributions is slightly shifted towards larger fillings .",
    "it is instructive to contrast the above results for the zero - mode conductance with the conductance found when the chemical potential intersects one of the @xmath14 bands instead .",
    "this case has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a completely different behavior has been reported . when contacted by wide electrodes",
    ", the zero - temperature conductance then assumes a quantized value ( in units of @xmath247 ) , where transport proceeds predominantly through snake states .",
    "this quantization can be rationalized by noting that right- and left - moving snake states are spatially separated @xcite .",
    "in addition , no pronounced dependence of the conductance on the respective band filling is expected , in marked contrast to the zero - mode case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . as we elaborate further in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , the finite - energy bands correspond to a realization of the conventional tll phase , which could also be detected through the predicted power - law corrections to the conductance at finite temperatures @xcite .    to summarize , the strong dependence of the zero - mode conductance @xmath240 on the filling factor @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , should allow for a clear experimental signature of the predicted interaction - induced conducting phase . as we argue in the next section ,",
    "such a state is distinct from a tll state , and hence also not described by fermi liquid theory .",
    "in strictly 1d band metals , it is well known that low - energy excitations near the fermi points at @xmath248 are severely restricted as a consequence of phase - space limitations @xcite , and therefore any nonzero electron - electron interaction slightly destabilizes the fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase is commonly coined `` tomonaga - luttinger liquid '' ( tll ) , where all low - energy properties of the system are fully determined by just two parameters when disregarding the spin sector @xcite . if galilei invariance holds in addition , which is the case for the continuum model considered here , a single tll parameter , @xmath249 , remains .",
    "the fermi liquid case is recovered for @xmath250 .",
    "the kubo conductance of an infinitely long and clean tll is @xmath251 @xcite , and single - particle correlation functions exhibit power - law behavior with exponents controlled by @xmath249 @xcite . to give just one example , the equal - time single - particle green s function , cf .",
    ".  , has the asymptotic power - law decay @xmath252 with @xmath253/4 $ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath249 is fixed by the interaction strength through the ground - state compressibility @xcite , @xmath254^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath255 is the ground - state energy and @xmath256 the single - particle velocity , see also ref .",
    "precisely this scenario has previously been identified in our mgw for all @xmath14 snake states @xcite . without interactions ,",
    "snake states propagate uniformly at the fermi velocity @xmath257 of the graphene host .",
    "they represent spatially separated chiral branches located near either of the two parallel zero lines of the magnetic field .",
    "the value of @xmath249 is then governed by coulomb interactions between these oppositely moving branches and can be tuned directly via the mgw width @xmath10 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the partially filled @xmath13 mgw band investigated here clearly does not fit into the above tll framework .",
    "first , without interactions there is no fermi surface , since the zero - energy level is strictly flat .",
    "second , when accounting for intra - band coulomb interactions on the level of the hf approximation , we found an interaction - induced dispersion , where the effective single - particle energies allow us to define a fermi momentum , @xmath151 , and a fermi velocity , @xmath147 , see fig .",
    "one may then naively conclude that once again a tll emerges , where @xmath249 follows from eqs .   and .",
    "however , this value of @xmath249 does not describe correctly the conductance of the system which is zero .",
    "we stress that the vanishing conductance of the @xmath13 band alone holds true even when performing an exact calculation , see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . therefore ,",
    "contrary to all @xmath258 bands , we conclude that the @xmath13 band can not be described by a bosonized gaussian field theory underlying the luttinger liquid concept @xcite .",
    "only when accounting for virtual interband transitions to conducting @xmath258 bands , the @xmath13 band acquires a nonzero conductance for which we find a quite peculiar dependence on the filling @xmath24 .",
    "we expect that apart from the mgw studied here , similar behavior should be observable also in other settings .",
    "for instance , consider metallic carbon nanotubes with a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the tube axis @xcite . this field should be inhomogeneous on the scale of the tube radius , such that a non - zero net magnetic flux @xmath259 penetrates the tube , since only then a finite degeneracy , @xmath260 , of the @xmath13 landau level is guaranteed by index theorems @xcite , see also ref .",
    "accounting for intra - landau level interactions , we expect that dispersion of the @xmath13 level is created .",
    "nonetheless , the system will still exhibit insulating behavior when the fermi level is close to neutrality , and only when including inter - landau level interactions , a non - zero conductance can emerge .",
    "similar to the case of the mgw , the actual value of the conductance will then give direct information on the strength of the coulomb interaction , and the conductance behavior of the @xmath13 level should again significantly differ from all @xmath14 bands .",
    "our theory assumes that one works with a ballistic ( disorder - free ) sample .",
    "we expect that very weak disorder will not qualitatively change the scenario outlined above , but strong disorder will introduce localization and thereby destroy the physics described here .",
    "since ballistic transport is nowadays reachable in high - quality graphene devices , our results should be testable in the near future .    to conclude , the zero - energy levels in a clean magnetic graphene waveguide are predicted to display qualitatively different conductance features than the bands of nonzero energy . for the latter ,",
    "the zero - temperature conductance is quantized in multiples of the conductance quantum .",
    "in contrast , the zero - mode conductance is non - universal with a strong dependence on the filling factor .",
    "since without coulomb interactions this conductance vanishes identically , transport experiments offer a direct interaction probe .",
    "we hope that our predictions can soon be put to an experimental test and will inspire further studies of this novel transport regime .",

    "<S> we consider a waveguide formed in a clean graphene monolayer by a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle dispersion relation for this waveguide exhibits a zero - energy landau - like flat band , while finite - energy bands have dispersion and correspond , in particular , to snake orbits . for zero - mode states , </S>",
    "<S> all matrix elements of the current operator vanish , and a finite conductance can only be caused by virtual transitions to finite - energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> we show that coulomb interactions generate such processes . in stark contrast to finite - energy bands , the conductance is not quantized and shows a characteristic dependence on the zero - mode filling . </S>",
    "<S> transport experiments thereby offer a novel and highly sensitive probe of electron - electron interactions in clean graphene samples . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this interaction - driven zero - mode conductor may also appear in other physical settings and is not captured by the conventional tomonaga - luttinger liquid description . </S>"
