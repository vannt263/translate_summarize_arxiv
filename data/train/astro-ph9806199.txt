    "although we know now that the high energy spectrum of agns is driven by accretion processes in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole , the detailed nature and geometry of the nuclear emitting region are still unclear .",
    "the radio quiet agns have first been divided in two spectral classes based on optical classification ( khalichikyan & weedman @xcite).the seyfert 1s show broad ( up to 10000 km / s ) and narrow ( up to 1000 km / s ) emission lines while the seyfert 2s show only the narrow ones .",
    "the broad lines originate probably from hot photoionized clouds + within 1 parsec of the central source , while the narrow lines originate in moving clouds at kilo parsec distances .",
    "the most popular models to explain these differences are the unified models ( see antonucci @xcite for a review ) . in this scheme seyfert 1s and 2s",
    "have intrinsically the same nucleus , the differences are simply due to an inclination effect .",
    "an optically thick torus of dust and molecular gas surrounds the nucleus and the broad line region ( blr ) , obscuring our view of the blr when our line of sight lies close to the torus plane . in this case",
    "the galaxy appears as a seyfert 2 since only the nrl are visible .",
    "the blr and the nucleus are visible only when we view from within a cone aligned with the polar axis of the torus .",
    "the galaxy then appears as seyfert 1 .",
    "the most extreme hypothesis , called the straw s person model , assumes that the thickness and the opening angle of the torus are the same in all seyfert galaxies .",
    "this model received strong supports from observations , but there are now some hints that the reality is more complex lying somewhere between the straw s person model and the hypothesis that seyfert 1s and 2s are intrinsically different objects .    since the high energy photons are less altered by the environment , and because of their short time variability , the observed x and @xmath0 spectra provide information on the inner regions and the primary source",
    "they are well described by an intrinsic power law with photon index @xmath4 ( pounds et al .",
    "@xcite ; nandra & pounds @xcite ) with a cut - off at a few hundred kev ( jourdain et al .",
    "@xcite ; johnson et al .",
    "this powerlaw is interpreted as the result of comptonisation of soft ( uv ) photons by high energy electrons or pairs .",
    "ginga observations have shown the presence of secondary components surimposed on the powerlaw . among them a reflected component arising from compton reflection on cold matter ( white & lightman @xcite ) and a neutral @xmath5 line .",
    "these components suggest the presence of a cold thick gas in the region where most of the power is released .",
    "this is corroborated by the presence in many sources of a strong uv bump interpreted as a thermally radiating medium .",
    "this uv emission was thought to arise from internal dissipation in an accretion disc until variability studies of and ( clavel et al .",
    "@xcite ; warwick et al .",
    "@xcite ; perola et al .",
    "@xcite ) showed a correlated uv and x variability which is inconsistent with the standard accretion disc model .",
    "the uv and optical continua are more likely due to the reprocessing of the high energy radiation .",
    "all these elements have led to consider various geometries where an x - ray source is located above a cold accretion disc and reilluminates it , inprinting the reflection features on the observed spectrum ( zdziarski et al .",
    "@xcite ; haardt et maraschi , ) . in these models",
    "the x - ray source is isotropic , half of the x - rays impinges on the disc and is reprocessed .",
    "this produces a black body uv luminosity of about the same magnitude as the hard comptonized luminosity .",
    "this is contrary to observations which often show a uv luminosity several times greater than x - ray luminosity ( walter et fink @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , some observations of the line with a large equivalent width ( @xmath6 ev , nandra et al .",
    "@xcite ) seem to require more impinging radiation .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) pointed out that the anisotropy of both the uv radiation field and the ic process should lead to more x - ray photons scattered backward than upward .",
    "however , the discovery by osse and sigma of an ubiquitous cut - off around a few hundred kev has focused the attention on thermal models , stimulating detailed calculations of the coupling between the hot source and the cold disc .",
    "the most popular model , favored by these calculations , is the patchy corona model ( haardt et al .",
    "@xcite ; stern et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scheme the emitting region",
    "is modeled by a small number ( @xmath7 ) of active regions on the surface of the accretion disc .",
    "this model is in good agreement with the data .",
    "however , it requires internal dissipation in the disc to explain large uv to x ratios , which is again difficult to reconcile with simultaneous optical - uv variability .",
    "it seems also to have difficulties to explain photon index softer than 2 , as observed in some seyfert 2s ( smith & done , @xcite ) .    as an alternative ,",
    "henri et petrucci ( @xcite , hereafter hp97 ) proposed a model where the hard x - rays are emitted by a unique non - thermal optically thin point source .",
    "this source is located above an accretion disc and illuminates it .",
    "such a source could be physically realized by a strong shock terminating an aborted jet ( petrucci et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the seed photons are provided by the thermal emission of the disc .",
    "this disc is represented by an infinite slab which radiates only the reprocessed energy from the hot source whithout internal dissipation .",
    "the anisotropy of the soft photon field influences the compton process making the x/@xmath0 emission strongly anisotropic .",
    "hp97 calculated in a self - consistent way the angular distribution of the high energy radiation and the disc temperature profile .",
    "this anistropic illumination model ( aim ) was found to give a good explanation of the observed distribution of uv / x luminosity ratios in seyfert 1s .",
    "the high energy cut - off can be obtained by an appropriate shape of the particle distribution that can be naturally produced by reacceleration associated with pair production ( done et al .",
    "@xcite , henri & pelletier @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate further this anisotropic illumination scenario .",
    "we calculated the reflection component expected from this geometry ( _ sect .  2 _ ) .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the x - ray source leads to an overall spectrum which is highly angle dependent . for nearly pole - on viewing angles ,",
    "the reflected component dominates the hard x - ray spectrum . in _ sect .",
    "3 _ , we compare our results with observed spectra of , and .",
    "the small amount of reflection in these objects requires nearly edge - on inclination angles . to date , no reflection dominated seyfert 1 has been detected .",
    "it means that _ in the framework of the present model all the x/@xmath0 observed seyfert 1s are seen with large inclinations_. this point and possible implications for seyfert galaxies are discussed in _ sect .",
    "the calculation of the reflected component of the proposed model is a bit peculiar , since the incident flux is angle dependent .",
    "the flux from the primary x - ray source , radiated in a direction defined by an angle @xmath8 with the normal to the disc was given in hp97 ( eq .  78 ) with a form similar to : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the photon index and @xmath12 the cut - off energy . + the anisotropy coefficients are given by : @xmath13 note that the effective cut - off energy @xmath14 is angle dependent . +",
    "this form of @xmath15 differs from the classical power law plus exponential cut - off by the 1/2 exponent under the @xmath16 function .",

    "this work is currently in progress and it seems that in the allowed range of parameters there are few constraints on the shape of the electron distribution .",
    "for example , we could choose the more general distribution :    @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + which leads to a photon flux :    @xmath19 \\label{fdir}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper , we will use this last expression . indeed , the model does not constrain the detailed shape of the primary spectrum but only the integrated luminosities .    for directions",
    "@xmath20 , the radiation impinges on the disc .",
    "a fair part of the luminosity is absorbed contributing to the disc heating , while a fraction is compton reflected leading to the formation of a secondary component @xmath21 .",
    "as for the isotropic case the strength and shape of reflected spectrum depend on the viewing angle ( magdziarz & zdziarski @xcite ) , but in a stronger manner .",
    "we performed calculations of @xmath22 using a monte - carlo code which enables a treatment of these anisotropy effects ( see poutanen et al .",
    "@xcite for a semi - analytic treatment of angle dependent illumination ) .",
    "our code takes into account both compton diffusions in cold matter , photoabsorption and iron fluorescence .",
    "the disc is supposed to be optically thick , we fixed its column density at @xmath23 .",
    "the photoabsorption opacities are those from morrisson & mc cammon ( @xcite ) which assume neutral matter with standard abundances .",
    "this code was tested , for the isotropic case , against the results of magdziarz & zdziarski @xcite and found in good agreement .",
    "assuming neutral matter means that the source height is supposed to be large enough for the impinging x - ray flux not to ionize the disc significantly .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observations of the 6.4  kev line ( pound et al .",
    "@xcite ; nandra & pounds @xcite ) .",
    "an ionized reflector would increase the reflected continuum below 10 kev where its contribution to the overall spectrum is usually very weak .    in petrucci & henri ( @xcite ) ,",
    "general relativity effects were studied and found to have negligible influence on the primary and reprocessed spectrum for source heights greater than 25 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 to @xmath26 cm for typical masses ) . in this limit indeed , the characteristic size of the disc area where most of the source power is radiated , is much larger than the gravitational radius . since our assumption of neutral matter requires a large source height , we assume that general relativity effects on the reflection component are negligible and use an euclidean metric . also we did not attempt to take into account the doppler effect from the disc rotation . these effects would affect essentially the line shape .",
    "the reflected luminosity does not contribute to the disc heating .",
    "this could modify the temperature disc profile derived in hp97 .",
    "actually the disc albedo is small and we can neglect the incidence of reflection on the disc - source energy balance .",
    "we checked a posteriori that the total reflected luminosity is only about 10 @xmath27 of the total incident luminosity .",
    "also minor modifications of the primary spectrum arising from reflected photons going back to the hot source have been neglected .    with all these approximations",
    "the high energy spectrum shape is independent of the source height above the infinite disc .",
    "the main result from our calculations is that the overall spectrum is strongly dependent on the viewing angle @xmath8 , defined as the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the disc .",
    "[ calspec ] shows two spectra obtained for edge - on and face - on inclinations .",
    "the hard x - ray source is highly anisotropic , the downward to upward emitted power ratio is about 7 , leading to a reflection component higher than for isotropic models .",
    "furthermore , this anisotropy leads to an increasing apparent luminosity of the primary emission with increasing @xmath8 ( see hp97 ) . on the other hand",
    "the reflected flux is roughly proportional to the projected disc area seen by the observer which decreases as @xmath10 .",
    "so , _ the reflection component dominates the high energy spectrum for low inclinations_.    the amount of reflection in the overall spectrum can be quantified by the reflection coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "this empirical parameter is used to account for anisotropy and geometry uncertainties when comparing an isotropic reflection model with data .",
    "@xmath28 is usually defined as the normalisation ratio between an observed reflected component to the calculated reflection obtained for an isotropic source illuminating an infinite slab seen with a given reference inclination angle @xmath29 .",
    "the choice of @xmath29 is important since even in the isotropic case the reflected spectrum shape and normalisation are angle dependent . usually @xmath29 is chosen to be @xmath30 because for this angle the spectrum is very close to the angle averaged spectrum , some authors prefer @xmath31 since seyfert 1s are expected to be seen pole on .",
    "here we estimate the reflection coefficient predicted by the aim .",
    "our @xmath32 is the ratio of the number of reflected photons predicted by the model for a given @xmath33 , to the photon number obtained if the source was isotropic  and emitting the spectrum predicted by our model for an inclination @xmath33  and observed with an inclination @xmath34 :    @xmath35    fig .",
    "[ rdemu ] shows @xmath28 as a function of the inclination angle .",
    "@xmath28 , increasing quickly with @xmath33 , is of order of unity for angles around 80 - 75 degrees and become important for smaller angles reaching values of about 50 for small inclinations .    as the observed r in seyfert 1 galaxies is of order unity",
    ", we can already see that the anisotropic illumination model predicts an important inclination angle for those seyfert 1s that have been well studied in hard x - rays . in the next section we test our model against the high energy spectra of , and and derive inclination angles for these objects .",
    "in order to test the anisotropic illumination model and its predicted reflection component , we need spectral data in the 1500 kev range .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies are faint at high energy , osse detected only 12 of them with a good photon statistic ( johnson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . if we discard those which were not observed simultaneously by a lower energy instrument their number falls to only 3 objects for which data are available , namely , and .    for we used the rosat , ginga and osse data from madejski et al .",

    "the analysis of these components is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "so , we did not use the rosat data in our fit and considered ginga data only above 2 kev .",
    "we fit these data with a @xmath37 component model which has the following form : @xmath38 e^{-\\sigma\\,(\\,e\\,)\\,n_\\mathrm{h}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first component is the direct flux @xmath15 defined by eq .",

    "such a strong reflection component is unobserved in seyfert 1s .",
    "so , to be consistent with the data , the aim requires that all the observed seyferts are seen with a large viewing angle .",
    "obtaining acceptable fits of ic4329a , mcg 8 - 11 - 11 and ngc4151 spectra requires inclinations of 70 - 80 .",
    "while it is possible that these three individual objects are very inclined , it seems very unlikely to be the case for all the seyfert 1s galaxies observed by ginga , asca and bepposax .",
    "so we consider that the aim , in its present form , is ruled out .",
    "however , we showed that it could be reconciled with the data if one admit that a fair part of the disk is strongly ionised . a detailed study of the effect of ionisation as well as other improvements of the model that could reduce the reflection hump are under works .",
