    "new quantum algorithms are crucially needed to demonstrate that future quantum computers will be more than highly specialized machines , but instead highly versatile general purpose devices .",
    "unfortunately , the current choice of quantum algorithms available for future quantum computing devices is surprisingly meager . with some minor ( but important ) exceptions ,",
    "there are only three available classes of quantum algorithms , namely :    * \\1 ) quantum hidden subgroup ( qhs ) algorithms , i.e. , shor / simon - like algorithms , * \\2 ) amplitude amplification algorithms , i.e. , grover - like algorithms , and * \\3 ) quantum algorithms that simulate quantum systems on a quantum computer .    in this paper , we focus on the development of new non - abelian qhs algorithms because of their tantalizing promise of exponential speedup over existing classical algorithms",
    ".  for example , should there be a major breakthrough in non - abelian qhs algorithm development , then there is the enticing possibility that it might be possible to develop a polynomial - time qhs algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem .    in spite of the efforts of many researchers ,",
    "the number of new non - abelian qhs algorithms is very small and scattered .",
    "why is it so difficult to generalize qhs algorithms to non - abelian groups ?",
    "before we can even guess at an answer to this question , we first need to define what we mean by a quantum hidden subgroup algorithm .",
    "we begin by first defining the classical hidden subgroup problem :    * hidden subgroup problem . given a group @xmath0 and a map @xmath1 ( not necessarily a morphism ) of @xmath0 into a group @xmath2 , is it possible to find an invariant subgroup @xmath3 of @xmath0 such that the map @xmath4 can be factored into the composition @xmath5 of two maps @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the natural epimorphism , and where @xmath9 denotes an injection .",
    "the subgroup @xmath3 is called a _ hidden subgroup_.    the quantum analog of the classical hidden problem is defined as follows :    * generic quantum hidden subgroup problem .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be hilbert spaces with respective orthonormal bases@xmath12 assume that @xmath1 is given as a unitary transformation@xmath13{rrl}% u_{f}:\\mathcal{h}_{g}\\otimes\\mathcal{h}_{h } & \\longrightarrow & \\mathcal{h}% _ { g}\\otimes\\mathcal{h}_{h}\\\\ \\left\\vert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\vert h\\right\\rangle \\quad\\   & \\longmapsto & \\left\\vert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\vert f(g)h^{-1}\\right\\rangle \\end{array}\\ ] ] determine the hidden subgroup of @xmath4 by making as few queries as possible to the blackbox @xmath14 .",
    "we can now in turn define what we mean by a qhs algorithm that solves the above qhs problem :    the generic quantum hidden subgroup ( qhs ) algorithm is essentially ( ignoring many subtleties ) the following :    * step o. initialize two registers @xmath15left - reg@xmath16 in @xmath17 and @xmath15right - reg@xmath16 in @xmath11 to produce the initial state @xmath18 , assuming additive notation for @xmath0 , and multiplicative notation for @xmath2 .",
    "apply the fourier transform @xmath19 to the left register .",
    "apply the unitary transformation @xmath14 .",
    "( as mentioned by shor @xcite , there is no need to measure the right register . ) * step 3 . again",
    "apply the fourier transform @xmath19 to the left register . * step 4 . measure the left register . *",
    "step 5 . repeat steps 0 through 4 until enough measurements have been made to determine the hidden subgroup .",
    "both jozsa @xcite and kitaev @xcite have noted that simon s quantum algorithm and shor s quantum factoring algorithms can be viewed as instances of the same generic quantum hidden subgroup algorithm for abelian groups .",
    "simon s algorithm determines a hidden subgroup of the direct sum of cyclic groups of order 2 .",
    "shor s algorithm determines a hidden subgroup of the infinite cyclic group .",
    "but can the generic abelian hidden subgroup algorithm be extended to a larger class of groups ?",
    "if it could be extended to a large enough class of non - abelian groups , then there is a strong possibility that a polynomial - time quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem could be found in this way .",
    "( for an in depth study of the graph isomorphism problem , see , for example , hoffman@xcite . for applications , see , for example , tarjan@xcite . for a discussion as to how to extend the quantum hidden subgroup problem to non - abelian groups ,",
    "see for example lomonaco@xcite . )    but once again , we ask:@xmath20    we can not give a complete answer to this question .",
    "but we can give some clues as to why non - abelian qhs algorithm development has been so difficult .",
    "the devil is in the details .  by that we mean the following :    a number of subtleties were ignored in the above description of the generic qhs algorithm .",
    "these subtleties become absolutely crucial when one tries to extend the generic qhs algorithm to a larger class of non - abelian groups .",
    "there is simply not enough space to discuss all the important subtleties in regard to the generic qhs algorithm .",
    "so we will focus on only one , which the authors believe has been ignored by many in the research community .",
    "contrary to conventional wisdom , simon s and shor s algorithms are far from the same generic qhs algorithm .",
    "to say so is a gross oversimplification .",
    "there are crucial differences .",
    "shor s algorithm , unlike simon s , outputs group characters which are approximations to the group characters actually sought .    more specifically , to find a hidden subgroup of @xmath1 , shor s algorithm selects a large  epimorphic image @xmath21 for approximating  @xmath4 .",
    "crucially , shor s algorithm also selects a correct  transversal map @xmath22 , where a transversal @xmath23 is an injection such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the identity map on @xmath26 .",
    "once the transversal @xmath27 has been selected , we can define an approximation @xmath28 to @xmath4 by @xmath29 .",
    "we can now use the fourier transform of @xmath28 associated with the group @xmath26 to find the hidden subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , shor s algorithm outputs random group characters of @xmath26 which are approximations to the group characters of @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize one key point here : @xmath30 on the one hand , a good choice will produce an efficient algorithm . on the other hand",
    ", a bad choice will lead to an inefficient algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , shor s original algorithm gives no hint as to how to choose the transversal @xmath23 generically .",
    "this , of course , is only one of the difficulties encountered in trying to generalize shor s algorithm to non - abelian groups .",
    "but it appears to be a crucial one that has , for the most part , been ignored .",
    "the significance of the correct choice of a transversal is made transparent by lomonaco and kauffman@xcite , where the correct transversal for the abelian qhs algorithm is found to be what is called in their paper a shor transversal .",
    "another obstacle to the development of new non - abelian qhs algorithms is the time complexity of the non - abelian fourier transform .",
    "the fourier transform on non - abelian groups is defined as follows :    let @xmath0 be a finite non - abelian group , and let @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33  , @xmath34 be a complete set of distinct irreducible representations of the group @xmath0 .",
    "each irreducible representation is a morphism @xmath35 from @xmath0 to the group of automophisms of the representation space @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 , denote the corresponding contragradient representation , where @xmath38 is the dual @xmath36 .",
    "extend the representation @xmath39 to the group ring , i.e. , to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the group ring of @xmath0 over the complex numbers @xmath42 , and where @xmath43 denotes the ring of endomorphisms of @xmath38 . then the _ non - abelian fourier transform _",
    "@xmath19 on the group @xmath0 is defined as@xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the direct sum .",
    "the above fourier transform can be expressed more explicitly , but less transparently , in terms of matrices .",
    "the algorithmic time complexity of the non - abelian fourier transform depends to a large extent on the basis chosen to express the fourier transform in terms of matrices .",
    "but this complexity will depend on which transversal @xmath23 is chosen for the non - abelian qhs algorithm !",
    "in this paper , we conjecture that one of the main obstacles to creating new non - abelian qhs algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem @xmath46 is the correct choice for the transversal @xmath23 .",
