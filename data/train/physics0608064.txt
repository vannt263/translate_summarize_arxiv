    "an earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the earth s surface @xcite .",
    "it is caused by the release of stress accumulated along geologic faults or by volcanic activity , hence the earthquakes are the earth s natural means of releasing stress . when the earth s plates move against each other , stress is put on the lithosphere . when this stress is strong enough , the lithosphere breaks or shifts .",
    "as the plates move they put forces on themselves and each other .",
    "when the force is large enough , the crust is forced to break .",
    "when the break occurs , the stress is released as energy which moves through the earth in the form of waves , which we feel and call an earthquake .",
    "aftershocks are earthquakes in the same region of the mainshock@xcite",
    ". smaller earthquakes often occur in the immediate area of the main earthquake until the entire surface has reached equilibrium of stress .",
    "there are several scaling laws that describe the statistical properties of aftershock sequences @xcite .",
    "gutenberg - richter frequency - magnitude scaling law is widely known by seismologists and scientists . on the richter scale , the magnitude ( m ) of an earthquake is proportional to the log of the maximum amplitude of the earth s motion .",
    "what this means is that if the earth moves one millimeter in a magnitude @xmath5 earthquake , it will move ten millimeters in a magnitude @xmath6 earthquake , @xmath7 millimeters in a magnitude @xmath8 earthquake and ten meters in a magnitude @xmath9 earthquake .",
    "so , the amplitude of the waves increases by powers of ten in relation to the richter magnitude numbers . therefore , if we hear about a magnitude @xmath10 earthquake and a magnitude @xmath11 earthquake , we know that the ground is moving @xmath12 times more in the magnitude @xmath10 earthquake than in the magnitude @xmath8 earthquake",
    ". numbers for the richter scale range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , though no real upper limit exists .",
    "the difference in energies is even greater . for each factor of ten in amplitude , the energy grows by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "when seismologists started measuring the magnitudes of earthquakes , they found that there were a lot more small earthquakes than large ones .",
    "seismologists have found that the number of earthquakes is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "they call this law  the gutenberg - richter law \" @xcite .    in seismological studies ,",
    "the omori law , proposed by omori in @xmath17 , is one of the few basic empirical laws @xcite .",
    "this law describes the decay of aftershock activity with time .",
    "omori law and its modified forms have been used widely as a fundamental tool for studying aftershocks @xcite .",
    "omori published his work on the aftershocks of earthquakes , in which he stated that aftershock frequency decreases by roughly the reciprocal of time after the main shock .",
    "an extension of the modified omori s law is the epidemic type of aftershock sequences ( etas ) model @xcite .",
    "it is a stochastic version of the modified omori law . in the etas model ,",
    "the rate of aftershock occurrence is an effect of combined rates of all secondary aftershock subsequences produced by each aftershock @xcite .",
    "the third scaling law relating the aftershocks is bth s law .",
    "the empirical bth s law states that the difference in magnitude between a mainshock and its largest aftershock is constant , regardless of the mainshock magnitude and it is about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath18 with @xmath19 the magnitude of the mainshock , @xmath20 the magnitude of the largest detected aftershock , and @xmath21 approximately a constant .    in this article",
    "we study the modified form of bth s law @xcite . to study the aftershock sequence in the north anatolian fault zone ( nafz ) we get the largest aftershock from an extrapolation of the g - r frequency - magnitude scaling of all measured aftershocks .",
    "we test the applicability of bth s law for @xmath1 large earthquakes on the north anatolian fault zone ( nafz ) .",
    "the emprical form of bth s law states that the difference magnitude between a mainshock and its largest aftershock is constant , independent of the magnitudes of mainshocks .",
    "we also analyze the partitioning of energy during a mainshock - aftershock sequence and its relation to the modified bth s law .",
    "bth s law states that the differences in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks are approximately constant , independent of the magnitudes of mainshocks . in modified form of bth s law for a given mainshock",
    "we get the inferred largest aftershock of this mainshock by using an extrapolation of the gutenberg - richter frequency - magnitude statistics of the aftershock sequence .",
    "the size distribution of earthquakes has been found to show a power law behavior . gutenberg and richter , introduced the common description of the frequency of earthquakes : @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cumulative number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than m occurring in a specified area and time window . on this equation",
    "a and b are constants .",
    "this relation is valid for earthquakes with magnitudes above some lower cutoff @xmath24 .",
    "earlier studies @xcite gave an estimate for this  b \" value between @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "the constant  a \" shows the regional level of seismicity and gives the logarithm of the number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than zero @xcite . in our analysis",
    "a - value is in the range @xmath26 .",
    "aftershocks related with a mainshock also satisfy g - r scaling ( [ denklem4 ] ) to a good approximation @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath23 is the cumulative number of aftershocks of a given mainshock with magnitudes greater than m. we offer to extrapolate g - r scaling ( [ denklem4 ] ) for aftershocks .",
    "our aim is to obtain an upper cutoff magnitude in a given aftershock sequence .",
    "we find the magnitude of this inferred  largest \" aftershock @xmath27 by formally taking @xmath28 for a given aftershock sequence .",
    "@xmath29 this extrapolated @xmath27 value will have a mean value and a standard deviation from the mean value .",
    "we apply the bth s law to the inferred values of @xmath27 and then , we can write @xmath30 where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the mainshock and @xmath31 is approximately a constant .",
    "substitution of equations ( [ denklem5 ] ) and ( [ denklem6 ] ) into equation ( [ denklem4 ] ) gives @xmath32=b(m_{ms}-\\delta m^{*}-m)\\ ] ] with b , @xmath19 , and @xmath31 specified , the frequency - magnitude distribution of aftershocks can be determined using equation ( [ denklem7 ] ) . in extrapolating the g - r scaling ( [ denklem4 ] ) the slope of this scaling or b",
    "- value plays an important role in estimating the largest inferred magnitude @xmath27 .",
    "we applied modified form of bth s law by considering @xmath1 large earthquakes on the nafz .",
    "these earthquakes occurred between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the data were provided by bogazici university kandilli observatory and earthquake research institute ( koeri)@xcite . the @xmath1 earthquakes considered had magnitudes @xmath33 .",
    "the important point is that they were sufficiently separated in space and time so that no aftershock sequences overlapped with other mainshocks .",
    "earthquakes form a hierarchical structure in space and time . therefore , in some cases it is possible to discriminate foreshocks , mainshocks , and aftershocks .",
    "but , generally this classification is not well defined and can be ambiguous .",
    "one of our main problems in the study of aftershocks is to identify what is and what is not an aftershock @xcite . to specify aftershocks we defined space and time windows for each sequence . in each case",
    "we consider a square area centered on the mainshock epicenter .",
    "the linear size of the box is taken to be of the order of the linear extent of the aftershock zone l , which scales with the magnitude of the mainshock as @xmath34 this equation was given by yan y. kagan @xcite .",
    "previously , shcherbakov and turcotte used the same scaling arguments for @xmath35 earthquakes in california @xcite .",
    "time intervals of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 days are taken except anakkale - yenice , mu - varto , and adapazari - mudurnu earthquakes .",
    "it should also be noted that for all @xmath1 earthquakes we took @xmath41 , richter magnitudes .    for kocaeli - glck earthquake the mainshock is @xmath42 and the largest detected aftershock had a magnitude @xmath43 . from equation ( [ denklem3 ] )",
    "the difference in magnitude between the mainshock and largest aftershock is @xmath44 .",
    "we have correlated the aftershock frequency magnitude data given in figure 1 with g - r scaling ( [ denklem4 ] ) and find @xmath45 and @xmath46 . from equation ( [ denklem5 ] )",
    "the inferred magnitude of the largest aftershock is @xmath47 . from equation ( [ denklem6 ] )",
    "the difference in magnitude between the mainshock and the inferred largest aftershock is @xmath48 .",
    "we applied the same procedure to the all @xmath1 earthquakes and found a , b , @xmath27 , and @xmath31 parameters .        for these @xmath1 earthquakes , the a , b , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath27 , and @xmath31 values are given in table [ tablo4 ] .",
    "+    [ tablo4 ]    .summaries of the data and results that show b and a parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to table [ tablo9 ] , for the north anatolian fault zone ( nafz ) , a large fraction of the accumulated energy is released in the mainshock and only a relatively small fraction of the accumulated energy is released in the aftershock sequence .",
    "the results of turcotte and shcherbakov are for the ten earthquakes in california on the san andreas fault zone . although safz ( in california ) and nafz ( in turkey ) have the same seismic properties , the released energy during the mainshocks in the nafz is much greater than the released energy during the mainshocks in the safz .",
    "figure 7 shows the dispersion of the magnitude differences @xmath49 and @xmath31 on the mainshock magnitude @xmath19 . in this figure",
    ", white symbols correspond to @xmath21 values and black symbols correspond to @xmath31 values .",
    "square , circle and triangle were used to prevent the coincides of the data on the figure ; because for six earthquakes , three of them have the same mainshock magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , figure 8 gives us the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath31 . in this figure ,",
    "line @xmath51 shows the harmony of our data with the bth s law .",
    "according to figure 8 , our data do not show harmony with the bth s law .",
    "bth s law states that the difference in magnitude between a mainshock and its largest detected aftershock is constant , regardless of the mainshock magnitude and it is about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "but in figure 8 , only one earthquake has @xmath21 values equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the other five earthquakes have @xmath21 values greater than @xmath0 . consequently , only @xmath52 per cent of our data show harmony with the bth s law .",
    "the rest part ( @xmath53 per cent ) of our data do not show harmony with the bth s law .",
    "the constancy of the differences in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks is an indication of scale - invariant behavior of aftershock sequences . in figure 8 ,",
    "line @xmath54 shows the harmony of our data with the modified form of bth s law .",
    "this line corresponds to @xmath55 line .",
    "if the modified form of bth s law gave us perfect results , @xmath21 and @xmath31 values would be close to each other along this line .",
    "hence , they would be the near of line @xmath54 .",
    "but in figure 8 , only one earthquake takes place on the upper side of this line .",
    "the remaining five earthquakes take place on the lower side of this line . consequently",
    ", our data do not show harmony with the modified form of bth s law .",
    "the other important conclusion is that we know most of the energy is released during the mainshock .",
