    "the current results on the energy spectrum of the highest energy cosmic rays are not fully consistent .",
    "the two high statistics experiments , agasa  @xcite and hires  @xcite , do not agree on the normalization of the ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) spectrum .",
    "in addition , hires results are consistent with a gzk  @xcite suppression , and agasa claims a spectrum extended to higher energy . with the current statistics the differences are not very significant  the number of events above @xmath2 differs by less than 3@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the normalizations of the spectra are quite different , especially in the common @xmath4 presentation , but a renormalization of the energy assignment by 1520% , which is within the reported systematic uncertainty of the energy assignment , of both data sets leads to a good agreement  @xcite . the high energy extension and exact normalization of the uhecr spectrum",
    "are thus not well known , but after the renormalization both experiments show the same spectral shape between @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "there have been recently several attempts  @xcite to explain this shape with different injection spectra of extragalactic protons after propagation to the observer from isotropically and homogeneously distributed sources .",
    "the assumed injection spectra and to certain extent the cosmological evolution of the sources determine the shape of the extragalactic cosmic ray spectrum at earth .",
    "a subtraction from the observed cosmic ray spectrum in these models determines also the end of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "there are two types of solutions .",
    "flat injection spectra , @xmath6 , are suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the galactic cosmic rays spectrum extends above @xmath0 .",
    "the other popular solution is to use much steeper injection spectra with spectral indices @xmath1 = 2.62.7 .",
    "such solutions set the end of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum at lower energy .",
    "the assumption that the extragalactic cosmic rays have a large fraction of nuclei heavier than hydrogen  @xcite modifies the propagation process and can potentially initiate a new class of models , in which the composition at injection introduces more model parameters .    cosmic ray data is not yet good enough to prove that any of these models are correct .",
    "fitting the spectra with several different parameters and the uncertain knowledge of the cosmic ray composition at @xmath0 makes all models plausible .",
    "we describe an attempt to fit the renormalized agasa and hires spectra with injection spectra and cosmological evolution parameters covering practically the whole phase space and to use the quality of the fits as a measure of the plausibility of the models .",
    "this involves several assumptions that , although used in many previous publications , may not be correct .",
    "the main one is that extragalactic cosmic rays are protons and that the renormalized experimental spectra represent correctly the shape of the uhecr spectrum .",
    "one of the fit parameters is the required extragalactic cosmic ray luminosity at present time .",
    "the uncertainty of the luminosity depends on the arbitrary renormalization of the experimental data , as well on the cross correlation with other parameters and assumptions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the fitting procedures that we use , section 3 gives the main results of the fits , and section 4 discusses the results , compares to other fits and derives the main conclusions from this research .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that a renormalization of about 15% of the energy assignment of the agasa and hires events , would bring the two spectra in very good agreement in the energy region below @xmath2 in both normalization and shape . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also shown that the statistics of events above @xmath2 is too small to achieve a conclusive result about the end of the uhecr spectrum . in this paper",
    "we study how the best fit to the injection spectrum depends on the source parameters : injection spectrum , luminosity and luminosity evolution with redshift .",
    "to do so , supported by the above - mentioned findings , we fit these injection parameters to the energy - shifted spectra in the energy range @xmath7@xmath2 .",
    "we chose as lower bound @xmath0 because we expect at this energy the particles to be mostly extra - galactic and @xmath2 as higher bound because of the sparseness of data above this threshold .    to calculate the expected spectrum from a isotropic homogeneous distribution of proton sources we use the analytical approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "all proton energy losses are included ( redshift losses , pair and pion production losses ) and they are all treated as continuous .",
    "this is the correct treatment for redshift losses and it is well suited for pair production and for pion production at large propagation distances . at small propagation distance , however , the large inelasticity of the pion production process produces large fluctuations in the expected fluxes that can not be reproduced in the continuous energy loss approximation .",
    "a monte carlo simulation is better suited in this case . in the present paper , since pion production affects mostly the highest part of the energy spectrum , and we are only interested in the spectra below @xmath2 , we can safely use the continuous energy loss approximation for all energy loss processes .",
    "we assume the sources inject protons with a power - law spectrum , @xmath8 , with a sharp cutoff at @xmath9 . changing the value of @xmath10",
    "does not appreciably affect the results in the energy region we are interested in .",
    "we assume the source emissivity to evolve as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the present cosmic ray emissivity of the sources and @xmath13 corresponds to absence of evolution .",
    "there is no cutoff to the evolution of the luminosity because we are only interested in the region above @xmath14 and in this region the contributions to the observed flux can come only from sources with @xmath15 . to calculate the energy losses we use the loss - lengths of ref .",

    "@xcite are likely due to the slightly different dataset , to the different range of data used for the fits and to the inclusion in our calculation of the experimental energy resolution .",
    "there is also a factor because the fits were performed with a @xmath49 shift of the agasa data set instead of the @xmath24 shift used here .",
    "it is interesting to note that the required values of the emissivity above @xmath0 cover a narrow range between 2 and @xmath50 and that the required luminosity increases with the flattening of the injection spectrum .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that we only present the luminosity required above @xmath0 . if we were to extend the energy spectrum to lower energy ,",
    "say to @xmath34 , we would observe exactly the opposite trend - steeper injection spectra would require much higher luminosity than flatter ones .",
    "after fitting the shifted agasa and hires data sets in terms of injection spectral index and cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources for an isotropic and homogeneous source distribution we obtained current emissivities above @xmath0 that differ only by about a factor of two . in this sense",

    "one could integrate down to the proton mass and obtain the highest possible emissivity . on the other hand studies of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks  @xcite find a minimum acceleration energy of @xmath52 which for @xmath53 = 1000 , as in gamma ray bursts , could be @xmath54 and would decrease significantly the required emissivity .",
    "modifications of the cosmic ray spectrum on propagation , such as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite because of magnetic horizon of the high energy cosmic rays  @xcite would not change the required emissivity .",

    "the hires fit is probably dominated by lower energy cosmic rays ( @xmath56 ) with much smaller error bars .",
    "the two fits give different central values for @xmath1 and @xmath20 but they are qualitatively consistent in the conclusion that even with a strong cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources the observed spectra do not support flat injection spectra .    we have fitted the shape of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum above @xmath0 assuming that these cosmic rays are protons , and that the sources of these protons are uniformly and homogeneously distributed in the universe .",
