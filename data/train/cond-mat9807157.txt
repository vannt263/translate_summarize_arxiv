    "a great deal of attention has been recently devoted to the study of physical effects induced by the presence of noise , i.e. phenomena appearing in stochastic systems , which would be absent in the sole presence of the deterministic part of the corresponding langevin equation @xcite . by",
    "now it is clear that noise can generate quite unexpected and counterintuitive behaviors as , for example , the _ stochastic resonance _",
    "@xcite , in which the output to input ratio of a bistable system subjected to the presence of an oscillating force is strongly enhanced by the presence of an additional stochastic term .",
    "other examples are the resonant activation @xcite , and the noise induced spatial patterns @xcite .",
    "another type of phenomena the noise is at the base of , are the so called _ noise induced phase transitions_. these came to light in an interesting paper by van der broek , parrondo and toral @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors pointed out the fact that some langevin equations may exhibit a noise - induced ordering transition ( niot ) , i.e. a phase transition that is not expected from the analysis of the deterministic part of such equation .",
    "the phenomenology is as follows :",
    "\\i ) for low enough noise amplitudes the system is disordered ( i.e. the order parameter takes a zero value ) .",
    "\\ii ) at a certain critical value of the noise amplitude the system exhibits a niot and , in a range of noise intensities above it the system remains ordered .",
    "\\iii ) finally , for noise amplitudes larger than a second critical value , the noise operates in a more standard way , this is , disordering again the system .",
    "we refer to this second phase transition as noise induced disordering transition ( nidt ) .",
    "a physical explanation of the niot was proposed in @xcite ; the ordering of the system is the consequence of the interplay between the noise and the spatial coupling @xcite . in particular , the noise generates a short time instability at every single site , and the presence of a spatial coupling renders stable the non trivial state generated in that way .    a minimal model capturing the essence of the niot has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "it has been clarified that the essence of the niot is purely multiplicative , this is , in order to generate an ordering transition the noise has to appear multiplied by the field variable . in this way , it has been possible to recognize that the niot is characterized by a set of critical exponents other than those of well established universality classes ( as for example , that of the ising model ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that due to the multiplicative origin of this transition it is possible to observe the phenomena in @xmath0 , dimension at which is very unusual to observe phase transitions .",
    "other results concerning niots and nidts can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all the previously referred models , is that they are defined by means of langevin equations , this is , equations describing the physics at a mesoscopic , coarse - grained scale ( in fact , the concept of noise is meaningful only at this level ) . in this context",
    ", it is an interesting task that of analyzing microscopic models that exhibit similar non - trivial behaviors ; one of which is the anneal ising model @xcite .",
    "by studying the connection between a microscopic systems and their respective mesoscopic representation one could shed some light on the way in which microscopic mechanisms generate the very non - trivial effects described at a mesoscopic scale .    in what follows",
    "we introduce the time honored anneal ising model .",
    "it was proposed and described more than twenty years ago by thorpe and beeman @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of it will be presented in the next section ; here we summarize the main properties we are interested in .",
    "the system is an ising model in which the interactions , @xmath1 , among spins , are annealed ( not quenched ) random variables that change from bond to bond and are extracted from a fixed probability distribution , @xmath2 . under certain conditions ( this is , for some distributions @xmath2 to be specified later ) , the system phenomenology is as follows :    \\i ) for low temperatures the system is disordered , i.e. the averaged magnetization is zero .",
    "\\ii ) at a critical value of the temperature , @xmath3 , the system exhibits a second order phase transition . as the temperature is further increased above @xmath3 the averaged magnetization keeps on growing until it reaches a maximum value and it starts decreasing if @xmath4 is increased further .",
    "\\iii ) at a second critical temperature , @xmath5 , the system exhibits another phase transition ( analogous to the well known ferromagnetic - paramagnetic disordering transition of the standard pure ising model ) .",
    "the system remains disordered for temperatures higher than @xmath5 .",
    "this phase diagram resembles very much the behavior of the previously described noise induced transitions in langevin equations .",
    "it is our purpose here to analytically derive a coarse - grained , mesoscopic , representation , in terms of a langevin equation , of the microscopic annealed ising model ( aim ) to further explore the eventual relations between both phenomena .",
    "let us consider a d - dimensional impure ising model in the sense that the value of the coupling constant among spins , @xmath1 , changes from bond to bond , being an annealed random variable with a fixed temperature - independent probability distribution , @xmath2 ( which is not quenched but annealed at every site ) .",
    "following the strategy proposed by thorpe and beeman @xcite the model can be exactly mapped into a standard pure ising model with an effective parameter , @xmath6 , that depends on @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and we write as @xmath7 . in particular @xcite , @xmath8-\\epsilon   ( k_{eff})}=0 \\label{eff}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the correlation function of two nearest - neighbor spins in the pure ising model . by solving the implicit equation eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) one obtains @xmath10 as a function of the temperature and the parameters characterizing @xmath2 . note that , in particular , for the two - dimensional case , the onsager s",
    "solution @xcite provides an explicit value for @xmath9 and therefore eq . ( [ eff ] ) can be solved and , furthermore , the system magnetization can be expressed as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "let us suppose now that , in particular , the distribution @xmath2 is centered at a positive value @xmath11 ( favoring ferromagnetic ordering ) , and has a variable width ( standard deviation ) , @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting magnetization for this particular type of distribution is qualitatively represented in figure 1 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "observe that for narrow distributions of @xmath1 the magnetization curve is similar to its corresponding in the pure ising model .",
    "instead , as @xmath12 is increased , a disordering tendency is observed at low temperatures , and in particular , for a large values of the width ( as for example , @xmath13 in fig.1 ) the system is disordered at low temperatures , and exhibits a disorder - to - order phase transition at a certain temperature .",
    "the standard ferromagnetic - paramagnetic ( order - to - disorder ) transition is also present and occurs at a variable value of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "the physical mechanism leading to the previous behavior was argued in @xcite to be the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic types of interactions that emerges when sufficiently large values of @xmath12 are considered . in particular , when @xmath14 both positive and negative values of the coupling constant are accessible at each bond , and in that case , for low temperatures the system is in a _ frustrated state _ in which ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains compete .",
    "that frustration makes the ferromagnetic order parameter to vanish .",
    "as the temperature is further raised the thermal noise activates annihilation of domain walls and the system is more likely to ordinate . as a result , the averaged magnetization grows with increasing temperature . at a given point",
    "this effect ceases , and the standard role of the temperature as a disorganizing source sets to work .",
    "let us now follow a standard procedure @xcite to cast the previous aim into a continuous langevin equation . for that purpose",
    "we first consider the pure ising model case , and write down its associated equilibrium partition function : @xmath15 introducing auxiliary gaussian integrals in terms of continuous variables @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 varying from 1 to the total number of spins , @xmath18 , in the lattice ) , and performing the change of variables @xmath19 we obtain @xcite @xmath20 .",

    "this could have been guessed a priori by using heuristic arguments , but we have preferred to follow the previous procedure that permits to obtain explicit expressions for the coefficients as function of the microscopic parameters . in this way , observe , for example , that both the diffusion constant and the coefficient of the quadratic term depend on the coupling through @xmath24 , therefore in order to simplify the notation we define the diffusion constant , @xmath25 .",
    "taking only the main relevant dependences on @xmath26 we can write @xmath27 , \\label{amit3}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a tuning parameter proportional to the distance to the critical temperature , and @xmath29 is a positive parameter .",
    "let us stress once more that we are neglecting higher order dependences of @xmath29 and @xmath28 on @xmath26 , and we assume them to be unessential to reproduce the microscopic phenomenology of interest at mesoscopic level ( this hypothesis will be verified afterwards ) .",
    "the simplest langevin equation with a stationary distribution characterized by a gibbsian distribution with the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ amit3 ] ) is well known to be @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a gaussian white noise with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    at this point",
    "we can analyze the effects of an annealed distribution of @xmath1 in the microscopic aim at the level of langevin equations .",
    "for that purpose let us observe that in order to mimic the variability of the coupling in the aim we can just substitute @xmath26 at each site in eq .",
    "( [ amit4 ] ) by a stochastic variable , namely : @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath26 and @xmath37 play the role of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively in the microscopic model . in this way",

    "\\label{final}\\ ] ] this equation ( intended in the ito interpretation @xcite ) constitutes our continuous representation of the aim .",
    "let us underline that the differences with respect to the pure case , eq .",
    "( [ amit4 ] , are two : the presence of a _ multiplicative noise _ , and an extra term that couples spatial fluctuations of @xmath26 with @xmath39 .",
    "changes of @xmath28 , parameter which appears multiplying both the linear term and the multiplicative noise , correspond to temperature variations .",
    "we have analyzed eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) in mean field approximation @xcite , and by performing systematic numerical simulations in two dimensions .",
    "the mean field approximation is performed along the lines discussed in @xcite . for the numerical simulation",
    "we have employed the euler method @xcite , in a 32 * 32 lattice , with lattice spacing @xmath40 , and considered a time mesh @xmath41 . without lost of generality the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath26",
    "have been fixed to @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "different noise amplitudes , @xmath44 , have been considered .",
    "the main results we have obtained are as follows : in both , mean field approximation and in the numerical simulation , we reproduce the qualitative behavior of the order parameter as a function of the temperature characteristic of the microscopic model ( see fig.2 and fig.3 and compare them with fig.1 ) .    in mean field approximation",
    "the order - to - disorder critical point is located at @xmath45 , and in numerical we obtain also a close to zero critical value which does not depend on @xmath44 . on the contrary ,",
    "the location of the disorder - to - order transition , depends on @xmath44 , analogously as the location of @xmath3 depends on @xmath12 in the aim .",
    "observe that this transition is not sharp in the lowermost curve of fig.3 due to finite size effects .",
    "curves in fig.2 and fig.3 change with increasing @xmath44 in the same way they do in the aim when increasing @xmath12 , i.e. , the larger the noise the smaller the ordering .",
    "let us stress once more that in order to obtain the transition , we change both the coefficient of the linear term and of the multiplicative noise term . if one of these two coefficients was kept fixed while the other was changed the microscopic phenomenology would not be reproduced . _",
    "the presence of the multiplicative noise term is essential to generate the disorder - to - order transition_. we have performed a numerical study of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) omitting the term proportional to @xmath46 , and conclude that none of the previous conclusions is qualitatively affected by this suppression ; by omitting this term the disorder - to - order critical point is shifted to a lower value of @xmath28 , and consequently this term has only a disorganizing effect .",
    "we could consequently write down a minimal model just by dropping out this unnecessary term , in the same way we omitted other irrelevant higher order dependences on @xmath26 in the derivation of the langevin equation .",
    "we conclude that _ the proposed langevin equation with multiplicative noise in the ito representation reproduces qualitatively all the interesting properties of the anneal ising model , and in particular the reentrant phase transition . _ therefore , once more it is shown that the multiplicative noise is the key ingredient of highly non - trivial phenomena in stochastic systems at a mesoscopic level .",
    "let us finally remark that the phenomenon we have just described _ is not _ the usual noise - induced transition as reported in previous works @xcite .",
    "first of all , in those works only the multiplicative noise amplitude has to be changed to obtain a niot , while in our case the transition is obtained by varying the parameter @xmath28 that multiplies both the multiplicative noise and the linear term .",
    "consequently in our case the disorder - to - order transition is not purely noise - induced .",
    "second , considering a stratonovich representation of the langevin equation with multiplicative noise is essential in those works to generate noise - induced ordering . in fact , standard langevin equations as those described in @xcite do not exhibit niots when intended in the ito representation ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the model presented here ,",
    "the langevin equation is intended in the ito sense , and due to its peculiar structure , namely the coupling between @xmath28 and @xmath47 , that we have justified from a microscopic point of view , it can exhibit a rather rich phenomenology .",
    "in particular the system shows an ordering and a disordering transition as the temperature is increased but it does not exhibit , for example , the short time instability characteristic of the phenomena discussed in @xcite .",
