    "one of the major goals in nuclear physics is the understanding of isospin symmetry violation related to the light quark mass difference @xmath3 and virtual photon effects .",
    "although the light quark mass ratio deviates strongly from unity , @xmath4 @xcite and one thus could expect sizeable isospin violation , such effects are effectively masked since @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the scale of the strong interactions ( which can be chosen to be @xmath7 or 1  gev or the mass of the @xmath8 ) . to assess the isospin violation through quark mass differences , precise measurements and accurate calculations are mandatory . as pointed out by weinberg",
    "a long time ago @xcite , systems involving nucleons can exhibit such effects to leading order in contrast to the suppression in purely pionic processes due to g  parity .",
    "nucleon scattering or neutral pion photoproduction are best suited for such investigations since a large body of ( precise ) data exists for various isospin channels . while there is still some discrepancy about the low ",
    "energy @xmath9 elastic scattering data , very precise neutral pion photoproduction experiments have been performed over the last few years at mami @xcite and sal @xcite .",
    "together with the new data on @xmath10 , a sensitive test of isospin symmetry could be performed if one would have information on the elementary neutron amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "this amplitude can only be inferred indirectly from reactions involving few ",
    "nucleon systems like the deuteron or @xmath12he . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on coherent neutral pion production off deuterium in the threshold region and study the sensitivity of the deuteron electric dipole amplitude @xmath13 to the elementary neutron amplitude , @xmath14 . the framework to do",
    "this is baryon chiral perturbation theory , which is reviewed in great detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is the effective field theory of the standard model at energies below 1  gev and allows one to explore in a systematic fashion the strictures of the spontaneously and explicitly broken chiral symmetry underlying the fundamental color gauge theory of the strong interactions , qcd .",
    "while originally formulated for the goldstone boson sector , the machinery can be extended straightforwardly to include single  baryon processes , treating the baryons as very heavy , static sources @xcite@xcite . in few ",
    "nucleon systems , a complication arises due to the existence of shallow nuclear bound states @xcite and the related infrared singularities in feynman diagrams evaluated in the static approximation .",
    "one way to overcome this is to adapt the rules and use chiral perturbation theory to calculate an effective potential , which consists of the sum of all @xmath15-nucleon irreducible graphs @xcite .",
    "the s - matrix , which of course includes all reducible contributions , is then obtained through iteration by solving a lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "several generic features of nuclear physics , in particular the relative strengths of two- and few - body forces @xcite@xcite@xcite or the dominance of soft  pion exchange currents @xcite , have been shown to arise naturally in this approach .",
    "for calculating scattering processes involving light nuclei , weinberg @xcite proposed to use chiral perturbation theory to generate the irreducible kernel and combine these with very accurate phenomenological external nuclear wave functions .",
    "although nuclear wave functions are calculable in chiral perturbation theory @xcite , they have not yet been determined with the accuracy matching that of the phenomenological models .",
    "therefore , we use the input from the successful phenomenological boson  exchange potentials which differ mostly in their short  range interaction parts .",
    "using a large variety of these potentials allows one to assess to which degree of accuracy one is sensitive to the chiral symmetry constraints used in determining the irreducible scattering kernel .    in this paper , we consider pion photoproduction on the deuteron at threshold extending the previous work by beane et al.@xcite .",
    "we calculate the invariant threshold amplitude to fourth order in small momenta and/or pion masses .",
    "this is mandated by the fact that only to this order in the chiral expansion one can achieve a satisfactory description of the elementary process @xmath16 @xcite@xcite . as already stressed in ref.@xcite , to third order in small momenta , the interaction kernel for neutral pion photoproduction off the deuteron",
    "has no undetermined parameters .",
    "unfortunately , although the same is true in the single nucleon sector , evidently the amplitude there converges slowly at best and thus the single - scattering contribution was treated as phenomenological input .",
    "since that paper was published , the situation has considerably improved and we are now in the position to consistently include the predictions for the single  nucleon sector . in particular , the precise @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is a generic symbol for a small momentum or meson mass ) chiral perturbation theory calculation @xcite@xcite predicts a very large neutron electric dipole amplitude , larger in magnitude than the corresponding proton one . as we will show , to fourth order in small momenta the interaction kernel can still be given entirely in terms of known parameters , and thus we will be able to calculate the sensitivity of the threshold cross section to the elementary neutron@xmath19 amplitude .",
    "we mention that charged pion photoproduction at threshold has been calculated accurately ( to four orders ) in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "since neutral pion photoproduction has already been studied extensively in more conventional nuclear approaches based e.g. on meson - exchange models ( see e.g. refs.@xcite@xcite ) , it is worth emphasizing why we use chiral perturbation theory here .",
    "as first stressed by weinberg @xcite , chiral perturbation theory allows one to _ systematically _ construct the many  body interactions between nucleons , pions and photons following the power counting rules .",
    "for example , in the case of elastic pion  deuteron scattering the phenomenologically dominant rescattering contribution was shown to be the leading three ",
    "body interaction in the chiral expansion thus leading to deeper theoretical insight . here , the phenomenological approaches to the single neutral pion production amplitude off protons based on born terms are at variance with the data by many standard deviations quite in contrast to chiral perturbation theory . to tackle the problem of how sensitively the deuteron threshold cross section depends on the elementary neutron@xmath19 amplitude",
    "can therefore only be addressed in a framework which allows one to systematically include and order the various contributions arising from single and multiple scattering processes .",
    "it goes without saying that this approach is only useful for the threshold region .",
    "we remark that contributions from the @xmath20isobar are encoded in some of the low ",
    "energy constants appearing in the single scattering matrix elements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the effective lagrangian underlying the calculation and the standard power counting formulas . in section 3 the calculation of the various contributions to the threshold s ",
    "wave amplitude is outlined .",
    "section 4 contains the results and discussions thereof .",
    "the appendices include our conventions and give some more details on the calculations .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the effective chiral lagrangian underlying our calculations and the corresponding power counting . for more details",
    "we refer to the review @xcite and to the paper by beane et al.@xcite .    at low energies , the relevant degrees of freedom are hadrons , in particular the goldstone bosons linked to the spontaneous symmetry violation .",
    "we consider here the two flavor case and thus deal with the triplet of pions , collected in the matrix @xmath21 .",
    "it is straightforward to build an effective lagrangian to describe their interactions , called @xmath22 .",
    "this lagrangian admits a dual expansion in small ( external ) momenta and quark ( meson ) masses as detailed below .",
    "matter fields such as nucleons can also be included in the effective field theory based on the familiar notions of non  linearly realized chiral symmetry .",
    "these pertinent effective lagrangian splits into two parts , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with the first ( second ) one consisting of terms with exactly one ( two ) nucleon(s ) in the initial and the final state .",
    "terms with more nucleon fields are of no relevance to our calculation .",
    "the pertinent contributions to neutral pion photoproduction at threshold are organized according to the standard power counting rules , which for a generic matrix element involving the interaction of any number of pions and nucleons can then be written in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a renormalization scale , and @xmath27 is a counting index , i.e. the chiral dimension of any feynman graph .",
    "@xmath27 is , of course , intimately connected to the chiral dimension @xmath28 which orders the various terms in the underlying effective lagrangian ( for details , see @xcite ) . for processes with the same number of nucleon lines in the initial and final state @xmath29 , one finds@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of loops , @xmath32 is the number of vertices of type @xmath33",
    ", @xmath28 is the number of derivatives or powers of @xmath34 which contribute to an interaction of type @xmath33 with @xmath35 nucleon fields , and @xmath36 is the number of separately connected pieces .",
    "this formula is important because chiral symmetry places a lower bound : @xmath37 .",
    "hence the leading _ irreducible _ graphs are tree graphs ( @xmath38 ) with the maximum number @xmath36 of separately connected pieces , constructed from vertices with @xmath39 . in the presence of an electromagnetic field , this formula is slightly modified .",
    "photons couple via the electromagnetic field strength tensor and by minimal substitution .",
    "this has the simple effect of modifying the lower bound on @xmath40 to @xmath41 , and of introducing an expansion in the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath42 . throughout",
    ", we work to first order in @xmath42 , with one exception to be discussed below . in what follows",
    ", we will work within the one  loop approximation to order @xmath2 ( notice that we refer here to the chiral dimension used to organize the various terms in the calculation of the single ",
    "nucleon photoproduction amplitudes ) , which extends the @xmath43 calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "such a higher order calculation is mandated by the fact that to order @xmath44 the single  nucleon neutral pion photoproduction amplitudes are too inaccurate .",
    "furthermore , one would like to see how big the corrections to the leading order three  body interactions calculated in ref.@xcite are . in terms of the counting index @xmath27 , in ref.@xcite all terms with @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "were included .",
    "we go one order further , i.e. we add _ all _ terms with @xmath47 ( remember that @xmath48 and we have exactly one photon coupling with @xmath49 ) .",
    "consequently , the effective lagrangian consists of the following pieces : @xmath50 where the index @xmath51 gives the chiral dimension @xmath28 ( number of derivative and/or meson mass insertions ) .",
    "the form of @xmath52 is standard .",
    "the terms from @xmath53 contributing to the single ",
    "nucleon photoproduction amplitudes are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "concerning the terms from @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we will discuss the pertinent ones below .",
    "also appear in the single nucleon calculation of refs.@xcite@xcite and from @xmath56 in the nuclear force calculation of ref.@xcite . ] with these at hand , we have to calculate tree and loop graphs for the single  scattering amplitude and tree graphs with exactly one insertion from @xmath54 for the three  body interactions between pions , nucleons and photons as well as tree graphs with one insertion from @xmath55 .",
    "as we will show later , the only new coupling constants appearing at @xmath17 are related to the single ",
    "nucleon sector and have already been determined in refs.@xcite@xcite .",
    "after these general remarks , let us now turn to the actual calculations .",
    "in this section , we outline how the various contributions to the electric dipole amplitude @xmath13 are calculated .",
    "the pertinent details are relegated to the appendices , including our conventions and definitions of the s  matrix .",
    "consider the reaction @xmath57 in the threshold region , @xmath58 .",
    "for real photons ( @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the photon polarization vector ) the s  wave photoproduction amplitude can be expressed in terms of two multipoles as , @xmath61 \\biggr\\ } \\ , { { \\phi}}_{i}(\\vec{p}-\\vec{k}/2 ) \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{m12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the differential cross section at threshold takes the form ( see appendix  a ) @xmath62 in what follows , we will discuss the chiral expansion of the dipole amplitude @xmath13 . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the relation to the commonly used amplitudes treating the deuteron as an elementary particle .",
    "the single scattering contribution is given by all diagrams where the photon and the pion are absorbed and emitted , respectively , from one nucleon with the second nucleon acting as a spectator ( the so  called impulse approximation ) .",
    "one only has a contribution to the @xmath63 amplitude of the form @xmath64 evaluated at the threshold value @xmath65 and with @xmath66 .",
    "a number of remarks concerning eq.([edss ] ) are in order .",
    "it is important to differentiate between the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) center  of  mass ( com ) systems . at threshold in the former ,",
    "the pion is produced at rest , it has , however , a small three  momentum in the latter @xcite . consequently , one has a single  nucleon p  wave contribution proportional to the elementary amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 as defined in @xcite .",
    "we use the p  wave low  energy theorems found in that paper , @xmath72 with @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the nucleon three  momentum in the @xmath67 com system .",
    "the derivation of eq.([boost ] ) is sketched in appendix  b. we have checked that dropping the terms of order @xmath76 in eq.([boost ] ) does not alter the results within the precision given .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the energy dependence of the elementary @xmath77 and @xmath78 s and p  wave amplitudes since the pion energy changes only by 0.4% for typical average nucleon momenta in the deuteron ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "we take for the elementary s  wave pion production amplitudes the predictions from the @xmath17 chiral perturbation theory calculation @xcite , @xmath79 in that calculation , the dominant isospin breaking effect , namely the charged to neutral pion mass difference , which is almost entirely of electromagnetic origin , has been taken into account .",
    "a fully consistent calculation including all effects from virtual photons and the quark mass differences is not yet available .",
    "the result for @xmath80 is based on the assumption that the counter terms entering at order @xmath2 are the same for the proton and the neutron apart from trivial isospin factors ( for a detailed discussion , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we also note that only the first process has been measured , the recent determinations from mami and sal give @xmath81 furthermore , the p  wave let for neutral pion production off protons has been shown to hold within 3% in ref.@xcite . using the argonne v18 @xcite , the reid soft core ( rsc ) @xcite , the nijmegen @xcite and the paris @xcite potential , we evaluate @xmath82 and find @xmath83 with an uncertainty of @xmath84 due to the various potentials used .",
    "the p  wave contribution amounts to a 3% correction to the one from the s  wave , i.e. it amounts to a minor correction .",
    "the sensitivity of the single  scattering contribution @xmath82 to the elementary neutron@xmath19 amplitude is given by @xmath85 all in units of @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 which is of opposite sign to the value based on the chiral perturbation theory prediction for @xmath80 . if one were to use the empirical value for the proton amplitude , the single  scattering contribution would be somewhat reduced .",
    "finally , we remark that the single  scattering contribution given in ref.@xcite is very different .",
    "this is due to the following .",
    "first , in that paper a factorized form for the single  scattering contribution was used , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the deuteron form - factor , @xmath91 note that the isospin factor @xmath92 was inadvertently omitted in @xcite .",
    "such a form is strictly correct only for the s  wave part of the deuteron wave function .",
    "switching off the d  wave component of the deuteron wave function , we get the same result as in @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the large numerical difference of our single  scattering contribution to theirs can be traced back to the use of the then accepted empirical value of @xmath93 and the one from the incomplete low  energy theorem for @xmath0 , @xmath94 in @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath43 ( corresponding to the counting index @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) three  body contributions ( meson exchange currents ) have been worked out in ref.@xcite , we will give them here for completeness .",
    "in the coulomb gauge ( @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the nucleons four  velocity ) and at threshold , only the two diagrams shown in fig .  1 contribute . in momentum space ,",
    "the corresponding structures are @xmath100 \\ , \\vec{q } \\,^2 } \\,\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath101 with @xmath75 and @xmath102 the nucleon cms three  momenta in the initial and the final state , respectively .",
    "these expressions can be fourier transformed into coordinate space easily and one finds that they give a contribution to the @xmath63 amplitude defined in eq.([m12 ] ) @xcite .",
    "evaluating these with standard deuteron wavefunctions gives , @xmath103 where the indices @xmath104 refer to the contribution from the s - wave , the mixed and the d  wave part of the deuteron wavefunction .",
    "we find for the three  body ( tb ) contribution at order @xmath44 @xmath105 for the argonne v18 , rsc , super soft core ( ssc ) @xcite and bonn potential @xcite @xcite , in order , and using @xmath106 as determined from the goldberger  treiman relation ( for @xmath107 ) ( to be consistent with the calculation of the elementary amplitudes @xcite ) .",
    "note that we use the full ( energy - dependent ) model of ref.@xcite throughout .",
    "the number for the bonn potential differs from the one given in ref.@xcite for three reasons .",
    "first , the overall sign of the contribution from graph b was incorrectly given and second , we find that the sd and d  wave contributions from this graph substantially alter the pure s  wave contribution .",
    "also , the d  wave contributions to graphs a and b were incorrectly evaluated ( the corrected formulae are given in appendix  c ) .",
    "if we , however , only retain the s  wave part of the deuteron wavefunction , we recover the result of eq.(26 ) of ref.@xcite ( modulo the sign and within the numerical precision ) .      at this order",

    "body interaction diagrams are shown in fig .  2 , the blob characterizing an insertion from @xmath54 . in principle , all the terms appearing in eq.([lpin2 ] ) can contribute .",

    "is more easily evaluated in momentum space .",
    "whenever possible , we have performed both types of integration as a check on our numerics ( for details , see appendix  c ) .",
    "in fact , there is a technical problem with the contribution from graphs b , l and p. counting powers of momenta , one sees that they are divergent .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the chiral expansion one has truncated the pion ",
    "nucleon form factor and thus does not suppress the high  momentum components .",
    "this phenomenon also occurs in the calculation of the nn potential in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "as it was done there , we introduce an additional gaussian cut  off factor of the form @xmath126 where the cut  off @xmath127 varies between the mass of the @xmath8 and @xmath128gev ( since it can be related to the mass scale of the heavy particles that are integrated out from the effective theory ) .",
    "notice that the divergencies appearing in other graphs all cancel and thus no further regularization is needed for those . for energy ",
    "independent nn potentials as used here , the contribution from the graphs @xmath129 should be omitted for the reasons explained in detail in ref.@xcite .",

    "furthermore , we remark that the kinematical @xmath130 corrections to graph 1a vanish and the ones for graph 1b are taken care of by shifting the value of @xmath131 as given in eq.([valk ] ) .",
    "finally , appendix  d contains some details on calculating the time  ordered diagrams in the heavy baryon approach .",
    "we find for the three ",
    "body ( tb ) contribution at order @xmath2 @xmath132 for the v18 , reid and ssc potentials , in order , and setting @xmath133gev . these amount to corrections of the order of 15% to the @xmath44 three  body terms .",

    "finally , we remark that if one were to include the contribution from the recoil graphs @xmath129 , the numbers given in eq.([edtb4 ] ) would change by less than 5 per mille .      in the @xmath43 calculation of ref.@xcite",
    ", no four  nucleon operators contributed to the deuteron electric dipole amplitude . using eq.([index ] ) , we see that for @xmath108 we can have exactly one insertion from @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "3a , b , we show the two graphs which in principle can contribute to pion photoproduction at threshold .",
    "clearly , diagram 3a is only relevant for charged pion photoproduction .",
    "graph 3b also vanishes for neutral pions , as the following argument shows .",
    "this diagram stems from the one shown in fig .",
    "3c by applying minimal substitution .",
    "the latter one contains the pion covariant derivative , @xmath139 which upon minimal substitution takes the form @xmath140 with @xmath141 the pion charge matrix and @xmath142 the photon field .",
    "consequently , @xmath143 and this type of term can only contribute to charged pion photoproduction .",
    "we therefore conclude that for threshold neutral pion photoproduction to order @xmath2 ( or up to counting index @xmath144 ) there is _ no _ contribution from any four  nucleon operator and thus no new , a priori undetermined coupling constants appear . in the case of charged pion photoproduction",
    ", this would be different .",
    "since as we have shown in the previous sections , neither the single scattering nor the three  body corrections depend on the potential chosen , we will present here results based on the argonne v18 potential .",
    "the chiral expansion of the electric dipole amplitude @xmath13 takes the form @xmath145 it is difficult to estimate the theoretical uncertainty , the value given in eq.([edtot ] ) being an educated guess , obtained as follows .",
    "we allow @xmath146 to vary between @xmath147 and @xmath148 , so that for a fixed value of @xmath149 , @xmath82 varies between 0.2 and 0.4 ( all numbers in canonical units ) .",
    "the results for the three ",
    "body contributions are stable at order @xmath44 , where as we assign a conservative uncertainty of @xmath150 to the corrections at next order due to the cut  off dependence .",
    "clearly , this estimate does not include contributions from higher order effects , which might give rise to a larger uncertainty .",
    "our final value is considerably smaller than the @xmath44 estimate reported in @xcite for the reasons given above . to see the sensitivity to the elementary neutron@xmath19 amplitude",
    ", we set the latter to zero and find @xmath151 ( v18 potential ) which is considerably different from the chiral perturbation theory prediction , eq.([edtot ] ) , i.e. the s  wave cross section would differ by a factor of two . for other values of @xmath152 , @xmath13 can be calculated from eq.([sensi ] ) . obviously , the sensitivity to the neutron amplitude is sizeable and is not completely masked by the larger charge ",
    "exchange amplitude as it is often stated .    on the experimental side ,",
    "neutral pion photoproduction off deuterium was studied by a group at saclay @xcite and later reanalyzed in ref.@xcite . in these papers , the s  wave amplitude @xmath153 was extracted .",
    "we remark that this analysis relies heavily on the input from the elementary @xmath77 amplitude ( to determine an unknown normalization factor ) and therefore should only be considered indicative .",
    "the s and p  wave multipoles used in @xcite are roughly consistent with the new determinations from mainz and saskatoon .",
    "the amplitude @xmath153 is related to our @xmath13 via @xmath154 using @xmath155 and the value of @xmath156 @xcite , we have as the `` empirical '' value @xmath157 taking the same sign as given for @xmath153 . since we could not trace back what the exact value of @xmath158 used in the saclay analysis was , we took the value based on the modern potentials evaluated above . notice that in the older papers of the saclay group , a larger value of @xmath153 was obtained , based on different input for the proton amplitude ( which is at variance with the new data from mainz and saskatoon ) .",
    "this was used to deduce the empirical number quoted in @xcite .",
    "obviously , this experiment should be redone at a 100% duty cycle tagged photon facility , with the same accuracy as was done for the process @xmath16 at mami and sal and with a refined theoretical analysis as is available now .",
    "the empirical number eq.([edexp ] ) agrees nicely with the theoretical one , eq.([edtot ] ) .",
    "however , we remind the reader about all the assumptions going into the extraction of this `` experimental value '' . clearly , only a more precise experimental determination of @xmath13 can tell whether this agreement is of significance . on the other hand ,",
    "if one would find a discrepancy , one would either have to reassess the calculation of the elementary amplitudes by including dynamical isospin  breaking effects and/or study in more detail the wave function dependence of the order @xmath2 three  body corrections .",
    "finally , two more remarks are in order .",
    "first , the sensitivity to the neutron amplitude has recently been studied in more conventional approaches @xcite@xcite .",
