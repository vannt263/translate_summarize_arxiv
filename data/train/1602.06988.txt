    "studies of kuiper belt dynamics first considered the effects of outward migration of neptune ( fernndez & ip 1984 ) that can explain the prominent populations of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) in major resonances ( malhotra 1993 , 1995 ; hahn & malhotra 1999 , 2005 ; chiang & jordan 2002 ; chiang et al . 2003 ; levison & morbidelli 2003 ; gomes 2003 ; murray - clay & chiang 2005 , 2006 ) . adding to that ,",
    "petit et al . ( 1999 ) invoked the dynamical effect of large planetesimals scattered from the neptune region and showed that it can explain the general depletion and excitation of the belt . with the advent of the notion",
    "that the early solar system may have suffered a dynamical instability ( thommes et al .",
    "1999 , tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 , morbidelli et al .",
    "2007 ) , the focus broadened , with the more recent theories invoking a transient phase with an eccentric orbit of neptune ( levison et al .",
    "2008 , morbidelli et al .",
    "2008 , batygin et al .",
    "2011 , wolff  et  al .",
    "2012 , dawson & murray - clay 2012 ) .",
    "the consensus emerging from these studies is that the hot classical ( hereafter hc ) , resonant , scattered and detached populations ( see gladman et al .",
    "2008 for the definition of these groups ) , formed in a massive planetesimal disk at @xmath530 au , and were dynamically scattered onto their current orbits by migrating ( and possibly eccentric ) neptune ( levison et al .",
    "2008 , morbidelli et al .",
    "2008 , dawson & murray - clay 2012 ) .",
    "the cold classicals ( ccs ) , on the other hand , probably formed at @xmath640  au and survived neptune s early ` wild days ' relatively unharmed ( kavelaars et al .",
    "2009 , batygin et al .",
    "2011 , wolff et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in our previous work , we considered two unexplained features of the kuiper belt .",
    "first , we examined the wide inclination distribution of the hcs and resonant populations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; nesvorn 2015a ) .",
    "we found that this is key to understanding the emergence of the kuiper belt .",
    "specifically , the inclination distribution implies that neptune s migration must have been long range ( neptune starting below @xmath025 au ) , and slow ( exponential e - folding timescale @xmath7 myr ) .",
    "this is because neptune needs to be given sufficient time to raise the orbital inclinations by close encounters with the disk objects .",
    "second , we showed that the concentration of ccs near 44 au , known as the kuiper belt kernel ( petit et al .",
    "2011 ) , can be explained if neptune s otherwise smooth migration was interrupted by a discontinuous change in neptune s orbit when neptune reached @xmath028 au ( nesvorn 2015b ) .",
    "the kernel forms in this model as bodies previously collected in neptune s 2:1 resonance are released at @xmath044 au when neptune jumps . taken together ,",
    "these results provide support for the planetary migration / instability model developed in nesvorn & morbidelli ( 2012 ) , where neptune slowly migrates from @xmath525 au to @xmath028 au , jumps by @xmath00.5 au by being scattered off of another planetary body during the instability , and then continues migrating to the original edge of the massive planetesimal disk at 30 au ( see also gladman et al . 2012 ; discussion in section 13 ) .",
    "nesvorn ( 2015a ) pointed out an outstanding problem with previous simulations of the kuiper belt formation ( e.g. hahn & malhotra 2005 , levison et al .",
    "2008 ) , including their own model",
    ". they called it the _ resonance overpopulation problem_. this problem arises when the number of resonant objects in the 3:2 resonance , @xmath8 , is compared to the number of hcs ( @xmath9 ) . according to observations , plutinos in the 3:2 resonance are @xmath02 - 4 times less numerous than the hcs ( gladman et al .",
    "2012 , adams et al .",
    "thus , @xmath10 - 4 .",
    "the populations in the 2:1 and 5:2 resonances are probably somewhat smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , the simulations of nesvorn ( 2015a ) , where neptune was slowly and _ smoothly _ migrated from @xmath11 au to 30 au , give @xmath12 - 0.5 ( fig .",
    "[ smooth ] ) .",
    ", possibly in better agreement with observations .",
    "these cases correspond to very long migration timescales ( @xmath13  myr ) . while this could help to resolve the resonance overpopulation problem , these very long migration timescales lead to several problems elsewhere . for example , the inclination distribution of hcs and plutinos in the 3:2 resonance obtained with @xmath13 myr is wider than indicated by observations , and the total implantation efficiency into the kuiper belt is @xmath14 , which is probably excessive .",
    "we therefore believe that the very long migration timescales do not provide a viable solution of the resonance overpopulation problem . ]",
    "a possible solution to this problem , suggested in nesvorn ( 2015a ) , is the _ jumping neptune model _ , in which neptune radially jumps by being scattered off of another planet ( fig .",
    "[ case9 ] ) . while the jumping neptune model was primarily motivated by the formation of the kuiper belt kernel ( petit et al .",
    "2011 , nesvorn 2015b ) , it can also help to reduce the resonant populations , because bodies captured in resonances before neptune s jump are released when neptune jumps , and thus do not contribute to the final statistics .",
    "here we conduct numerical simulations of the jumping neptune model and find that neptune s jump helps , but is not sufficient to reconcile the model with observations .",
    "we therefore investigate other solutions to the resonance overpopulation problem .",
    "we find that the problem can be resolved if neptune s migration was _ grainy _ due to a presence of pluto - class objects in the planetesimal disk that was driving the planetary migration .",
    "the principal difference between the smooth and grainy migration modes is that in the latter case neptune s resonances exhibit a random walk in the semimajor axis ( in addition to the smooth radial drift ) .",
    "this acts to reduce the resonant populations , because resonant orbits with large libration amplitudes can become unstable . at the same time",
    ", it helps to increase the hc population , because orbits evolve from neptune s resonances onto stable non - resonant orbits more easily than in the smooth case .",
    "specifically , we find that @xmath15 - 4 is obtained in the grainy migration model if the planetesimal disk is assumed to have contained @xmath11000 - 4000 plutos , or @xmath11000 bodies twice as massive as pluto .",
    "sections 2 and 3 describe our method and results , respectively .",
    "broader implications of this work are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the integration method with smooth migration of neptune is explained in section 2.1 .",
    "the migration parameters were chosen to match the orbital evolution of planets obtained in the self - consistent simulations of the planetary instability / migration in nesvorn & morbidelli ( 2012 ; hereafter nm12 ) .",
    "the initial distribution of disk particles is defined in section  2.2 .",
    "then , in section 2.3 , we introduce massive objects in the outer disk and let neptune react to individual scattering events . section 2.4 explains how we used the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) detection simulator to compare our modeling results with observations .",
    "our numerical integrations consist of tracking the orbits of four giant planets ( jupiter to neptune ) and a large number of test particles representing the outer planetesimal disk .",
    "to set up an integration , jupiter and saturn were placed on their current orbits .",
    "uranus and neptune were placed on inside of their current orbits and were migrated outward .",
    "the initial semimajor axis @xmath16 , eccentricity @xmath17 , and inclination @xmath18 define neptune s orbit before the main stage of migration / instability . in most of our simulations",
    "we used @xmath19  au , because the wide inclination distribution of hcs and resonant populations requires that neptune s migration was long range ( @xmath20 au ; nesvorn 2015a ) .",
    "we also set @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "all inclination values reported in this article are referred to the invariant plane of the solar system .",
    "the swift_rmvs4 code ( levison & duncan 1994 ) was used to follow the evolution of planets ( and massless disk particles ; see sect 2.2 ) .",
    "the code was modified to include fictitious forces that mimic the radial migration and damping of planetary orbits .",
    "these forces were parametrized by the exponential e - folding timescales , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath23 controls the radial migration rate , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 control the damping rate of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . specifically , the semimajor axis of neptune changes from @xmath16 to its current average of @xmath28 au as @xmath29 and the eccentricity and inclination of neptune evolve according to @xmath30 the expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 differ from those used in morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , where the damping rate @xmath33 was chosen to be proportional to @xmath34 . here",
    "we set @xmath35 @xmath36 , because such roughly comparable timescales were suggested by previous work .",
    "the numerical integrations of the first migration stage were stopped when neptune reached @xmath37 au .",
    "then , to approximate the effect of planetary encounters during the instability ( nm12 , nesvorn 2015b ) , we applied a discontinuous change of neptune s semimajor axis and eccentricity , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "motivated by the nm12 results ( see fig .  [ case9 ] ) , we set @xmath40 or 0.5 au , and @xmath41 , 0.05 or 0.1 .",
    "the purpose of @xmath42 is to have a reference case for comparison purposes .",
    "we use @xmath43 au , because nesvorn ( 2015b ) showed that this jump size would be needed to explain the kuiper belt kernel . note that the resonant objects are released from resonances with @xmath43 au , because the typical resonance width is just smaller than the jump size .",
    "no change was applied to the orbital inclination of neptune , because a small inclination change should not critically affect the processes studied here .",
    "the second migration stage starts with neptune having the semimajor axis @xmath44 .",
    "we apply the swift_rmvs4 code , and migrate the semimajor axis ( and damp the eccentricity ) on an e - folding timescale @xmath45 .",
    "the migration amplitude was adjusted such that the final semimajor axis of neptune ended to be within 0.05  au of its current mean @xmath28  au , and the orbital period ratio , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the orbital periods of neptune and uranus , ended within 0.5% of its current value ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "a strict control over the final orbits of planets is important , because it guarantees that the mean motion and secular resonances reach their present positions .    as for the specific values of @xmath50 and @xmath45 used in our model , we found from nm12 that the orbital behavior of neptune can be approximated by @xmath51 myr and @xmath52  myr for a disk mass @xmath53 @xmath3 , and @xmath54 myr and @xmath55 myr for @xmath56  @xmath3 .",
    "slower migration rates are possible for lower disk masses .",
    "moreover , we found from nm12 that the real migration is not precisely exponential with the effective @xmath45 being longer than the values quoted above during the very late migration stages ( @xmath57 myr ) .",
    "this is consistent with constraints from saturn s obliquity , which was presumably exited by late capture in a spin - orbit resonance ( vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2015 ; see ward & hamilton 2004 and hamilton & ward 2004 for the original work that proposed the spin - orbit resonance as the means of exciting saturn s obliquity ) .",
    "much shorter migration timescales than those quoted above do not apply , because they would violate constraints from the wide inclination distribution of hcs and resonant populations ( nesvorn 2015a ) . here",
    "we therefore used @xmath58  myr or 30 myr , and @xmath59 or 100 myr .",
    "these cases should bracket the range of possible migration timescales .",
    "the planetesimal disk was divided into two parts .",
    "the inner part of the disk , from just outside neptune s initial orbit to @xmath60 , was assumed to be massive .",
    "we used @xmath61  au or 30 au , because our previous simulations in nm12 showed that the massive disk s edge must be at 28 - 30 au for neptune to stop at @xmath030 au .",
    "if the edge of the massive disk were at @xmath630  au , neptune would continue migrating past 30 au ( gomes et al .",
    "the solar nebula could have become truncated , for example , by photoevaporation from the uv and fuv irradiation by background stars in a cluster ( e.g. , adams 2010 ; see also discussion in petit et al .",
    "in fact , a recent study of the dynamics of planetesimals embedded in a gas disk suggested that the solar nebula was truncated ( or else it would act to produce very high orbital inclinations , @xmath62 , in the kuiper belt ; kretke et al .",
    "the estimated mass of the planetesimal disk below 30 au is @xmath4  @xmath3 ( nm12 ) . as shown in levison et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the massive disk is the main source of hcs , plutinos and other resonant populations .",
    "it therefore has a crucial importance for the resonance overpopulation problem considered here .",
    "the planetesimal disk probably had a low mass extension reaching from 30 au to at least @xmath045 au .",
    "the low mass extension of the disk beyond 30 au is presumably the source of ccs ( batygin et al .",
    "2011 , wolff et al .",
    "2012 , nesvorn 2015b ) .",
    "it is needed to explain why the ccs have several unique physical and orbital properties ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "the disk extension should not substantially contribute to the present populations of the hot and resonant kbos ( nesvorn 2015b ) , because the orbital inclinations of bodies native to @xmath63 au remain small during neptune s migration .",
    "here we therefore do not initially consider the disk extension , and return to it only in section 3.4 , where we test whether a grainy migration is consistent with the formation of the kuiper belt kernel .",
    "each of our simulations included one million disk particles distributed from outside neptune s initial orbit to @xmath60 .",
    "the radial profile was set such that the disk surface density @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the heliocentric distance .",
    "a large number of disk particles was needed because the implantation probability in different parts of the kuiper belt is expected to be @xmath1@xmath2-@xmath66 . with @xmath67 disk particles initially , this yields @xmath1100 - 1000 implanted particles , and allows us to perform a detailed comparison of the model results with observations .",
    "the disk particles were assumed to be massless such that their gravity does not interfere with the migration / damping routines .",
    "this means that the precession frequencies of planets are not affected by the disk in our simulations , while in reality they were .",
    "this is an important approximation ( batygin et al .",
    "the direct gravitational effects of the fifth planet on the disk planetesimals were ignored ( see discussion at the end of section 4 )",
    ". these effects could be especially important for the ccs ( batygin et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "an additional uncertain parameter concerns the dynamical structure of the planetesimal disk .",
    "it is typically assumed that the disk was dynamically cold with orbital eccentricities @xmath68 and orbital inclinations @xmath69 .",
    "some dynamical excitation could have been supplied by scattering off of pluto - sized and larger objects that presumably formed in the disk ( stern & colwell 1997 , kenyon et al .",
    "the magnitude of the initial excitation is uncertain , because it depends on several unknown parameters ( e.g. , the number of large objects in the disk ) .",
    "the initial eccentricities and initial inclinations of disk particles in our simulations were distributed according to the rayleigh distribution with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the usual scale parameter of the rayleigh distribution ( the mean of the rayleigh distribution is equal to @xmath73 ) .",
    "we developed an analytic method to represent the jitter that neptune s semimajor axis experiences due to close encounters with massive planetesimals .",
    "the method has the flexibility to use any smooth migration history of neptune on the input , include a certain number of the massive planetesimals in the original disk , and generate a new migration history where the random element due to massive planetesimal encounters is included .",
    "this approach is useful , because we can easily control how grainy the migration is , while preserving the global orbital evolution of planets from the smooth simulations .",
    "we then proceed to test how the simulation results depend on various parameters , such as the number and mass of the massive planetesimals in the original disk .",
    "we start with a specific migration run in which neptune s semimajor axis evolves smoothly , except for a possible jump by @xmath38 due to an encounter with another planet .",
    "the migration parameters , namely @xmath16 , @xmath74 , @xmath38 , @xmath50 and @xmath45 ( section 2.1 ) , are specified at this point .",
    "as mentioned above , each run also includes @xmath67 test particles that represent the disk planetesimals .",
    "we first scan through the simulation output in small steps @xmath75 , and extract the orbit of neptune and the orbital distribution of disk planetesimals at each step .",
    "we then apply the pik - type collision probability code ( bottke et  al . 1994 ; see also greenberg 1982 ) to calculate how many encounters between neptune and planetesimals happen for encounter distances @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is some threshold .",
    "the gravitational focusing by neptune is taken into account in this calculation .",
    "the goal is to find how the number of encounters with @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 .",
    "we find that for small values of @xmath77 this dependence is linear ( while a quadratic dependence would be expected without gravitational focusing ) .",
    "this can be understood from the following expression for the impact parameter : @xmath78 \\label{eq : bq}\\ ] ] ( e.g. , bertotti et  al .",
    "2003 ) , where @xmath79 km is neptune s mean radius , @xmath80  km  s@xmath81 is the escape velocity from neptune s cloudtops , and @xmath82 is the encounter speed `` at infinity '' .",
    "parameter @xmath83 is the maximal impact parameter value for which the minimal encounter distance is lower than specified @xmath77 , when @xmath82 is fixed . since @xmath84 - 2",
    "km s@xmath81 , and thus @xmath85 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bq ] ) is greater than 1 for all encounters with @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "the number of encounters with @xmath76 in this regime is therefore proportional to @xmath77 . for @xmath88 , on the other hand , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bq ] ) prevails , and the number of encounters with @xmath76 becomes proportional to @xmath89 . in practice , we find it satisfactory to neglect the effect of distant encounters , because the distant encounters do not ( individually ) induce any significant changes of neptune s semimajor axis .",
    "we therefore only consider encounters with @xmath90 , where the scaling is linear .",
    "note that @xmath91 for @xmath92  km s@xmath81 .",
    "the pik code gives us the number of planetesimals having encounters with neptune , @xmath93 , as a function of the distance @xmath77 , time @xmath94 , and time interval @xmath75 . obviously , @xmath95 for the small intervals used here ( @xmath96 yr ) .",
    "the time profile of the number of encounters depends on the timescale of the planetesimal disk dispersal , which in turn is related to neptune s migration speed .",
    "we find from our simulations that @xmath97 with some exponent @xmath98 .",
    "for example , in the simulation with @xmath99  my and @xmath100  my , we have @xmath101 - 1.2 .",
    "then , if we approximate @xmath102 , the constant @xmath103 will depend on the initial number of massive planetesimals in the disk ( @xmath104 ) . here",
    "we consider @xmath105 , 2000 and 4000 , and rescale the original @xmath93 obtained with @xmath67 disk particles to @xmath104 .",
    "this gives us an approximate record of the history of close encounters between the massive planetesimals and neptune .",
    "equipped with the calibrated @xmath93 function , we sequentially consider each @xmath75 interval . with @xmath96",
    "yr , @xmath93 is always much smaller than unity . in each step",
    ", we generate a random variate @xmath106 with a uniform distribution between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we then set @xmath109 and solve for @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the maximum encounter distance considered here ( in practice we set @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the hill radius ) , the encounter is recorded , and we proceed with the next timestep @xmath75 . in the end , the method allows us to generate an encounter sequence that closely approximates the reality .",
    "note that for the typical encounter speeds considered here it only takes up to several months to cross @xmath115 .",
    "we proceed by computing the effect of individual encounters on the semimajor axis of neptune .",
    "this is done using a hyperbolic approximation of the planetesimal s trajectory relative to neptune .",
    "the hyperbolic approximation is adequate for deep encounters considered here , and in a regime when the encounter duration is much shorter than the orbital period of neptune .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath116 of the asymptotes of the hyperbola describing the planetesimal encounter trajectory can be obtained from @xmath77 and @xmath82 .",
    "specifically , introducing the half - angle @xmath117 , we find ( e.g. , bertotti et  al . , 2003 ) @xmath118^{-1}\\ ; . \\label{eq : th}\\ ] ] expressed in the inertial frame , the change of neptune s velocity vector is @xmath119\\ ; , \\label{eq : dvpl}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are neptune s and planetesimal masses , @xmath122 is a unit vector along the angular momentum vector of planetesimal s planetocentric trajectory , and @xmath123 is a unit vector along the incoming trajectory of the planetesimal ( relative to the planet ) . since we do not propagate the information about @xmath122 and @xmath123 from the original simulation , we assume that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are randomly ( isotropically ) oriented in space ( obviously , these vectors are perpendicular to each other ) .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation in a situation when the disk of planetesimals is dispersed by neptune .",
    "finally , we use the gauss equations to compute the orbital effect of @xmath124 on neptune s orbit .",
    "the eccentricity and inclination changes are neglected . in the approximation of a near - circular orbit of neptune",
    ", we obtain @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the change of neptune s semimajor axis , @xmath127 is a projection of @xmath124 onto the transverse direction of neptune s orbital motion , and @xmath128 is neptune s orbital speed .",
    "to compute @xmath127 from @xmath124 , we assume that @xmath124 has a random orientation . the change @xmath126 is computed for all encounters with massive planetesimals and recorded in a file . in a simulation",

    "figure  [ fig_enc ] shows an example of the sequence of @xmath126 in the case with @xmath99  myr , @xmath100  myr , and @xmath105 , where each massive planetesimal was assumed to have pluto s mass .",
    "the total number of encounters recorded in this case is @xmath1@xmath129 , implying that a massive planetesimal had on average @xmath1@xmath130 encounters with @xmath131 . as expected , most encounters happen during the initial migration stages when the planetesimal disk is still massive .",
    "the slight preference for somewhat larger range of the @xmath126 values at late epochs reflects the outward migration of neptune s orbit .",

    "the effects of encounters are clearly visible in panel ( b ) , where the ratio of orbital periods , @xmath46 , shows an irregular pattern . during the late stages , when the smooth migration nearly stalls ,",
    "the random effect of encounters with massive planetesimals can cause neptune to move slightly inward during some time intervals .",
    "this may be important for neptune trojans , because their stability sensitively depends on the maximal @xmath46 reached during the planetary migration ( gomes & nesvorn 2015 ) .",

    "2009 ) to compare the orbital distributions obtained in our simulations with observations .",
    "cfeps is one of the largest kuiper belt surveys with published characterization ( currently 169 objects ; petit et al .",
    "the simulator was developed by the cfeps team to aid the interpretation of their observations .",
    "given intrinsic orbital and magnitude distributions , the cfeps simulator returns a sample of objects that would have been detected by the survey , accounting for flux biases , pointing history , rate cuts and object leakage ( kavelaars et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the present work , we input our model populations in the simulator to compute the detection statistics .",
    "we then compare the orbital distribution of the detected objects with the actual cfeps detections using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( press et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "the cfeps simulator takes as an input : ( 1 ) the orbital element distribution from our numerical model , and ( 2 ) an assumed absolute magnitude ( @xmath134 ) distribution . as for ( 1 ) , the input orbital distribution was produced by a short integration starting from the final model state of the kuiper belt .",
    "the orbital elements of each object were recorded at 100 yr intervals during this integration until the total number of the recorded data points reached @xmath0@xmath135 .",
    "each data point was then treated as an independent observational target .",
    "we rotated the reference system such that the orbital phase of neptune in each time frame corresponded to its ecliptic coordinates at the epoch of cfeps observations . this procedure",
    "guaranteed that the sky positions of bodies in neptune s resonances were correctly distributed relative to the pointing direction of the cfeps frames .",
    "the magnitude distribution was taken from fraser et al .",

    "they were extended to 2 or 4 gyr with the standard swift_rmvs4 code ( i.e. , without migration / damping after 0.5 gyr ) .",
    "we performed 16 new simulations in total .",
    "four of these simulations considered the case with smooth migration . in case 1",
    ", we used @xmath99 myr and @xmath100 myr . in case 2",
    ", we used @xmath58 myr and @xmath59 myr . for each of these cases , we performed a simulation with @xmath40 , and another simulation with @xmath43 au .",
    "in addition , we performed 12 simulations with the grainy migration .",
    "these simulations shared the properties of the four smooth migration cases , but for each case we considered several different assumptions on the migration graininess .",
    "specifically , the outer disk was assumed to have 1000 , 2000 or 4000 massive planetesimals each with a pluto mass ( @xmath148 ) , or 1000 massive planetesimals each with twice the mass of pluto ( @xmath149 ; hereafter twopluto ) .",
    "a more detailed exploration of parameter space was not possible , because each simulation with @xmath67 disk particles is computationally expensive ( one full simulation for 4 gyr requires @xmath15000 cpu days on nasa s pleiades supercomputer ) .    for the population estimates discussed below",
    "we first need to define what we mean by different categories of kbos .",
    "the hcs are defined here as objects on orbits with semimajor axis @xmath150 au and perihelion distance @xmath151 au . using a smaller perihelion distance cutoff would not affect the population estimate much , because there are not that many orbits with @xmath152 au in the quoted semimajor axis range .",
    "we do not make any effort to separate the hcs from the populations in the 5:3 , 7:4 , 9:5 , 11:6 resonances that intersect the main belt .",
    "this should not be a problem either , because the populations in these weak resonances are much smaller than the hc population .    as for the 3:2 resonance , we require that the resonant angle , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the mean and perihelion longitudes of a particle , and @xmath156 is the mean longitude of neptune , librates .",
    "this is done by selecting all particles with @xmath157  au at the end of our simulations , performing an additional @xmath67-yr simulation for them , and computing the libration amplitude , @xmath158 , as half of the full range of the @xmath159 excursions .",
    "the maximum amplitude of stable librations seen in our simulations is @xmath160 , which is similar to the maximum libration amplitudes of known plutinos ( nesvorn & roig 2001 , gladman et al .",
    "the non - librating orbits with @xmath157 au typically have low eccentricities , because the low eccentricities are required near the 3:2 resonance for the orbital stability .",
    "we first discuss whether neptune s jump , as suggested in nesvorn ( 2015a ) , can help to resolve the resonance overpopulation problem .",
    "figure [ smooth2 ] shows the final distribution of orbits implanted into the kuiper belt in case 1 with smooth migration . for @xmath161 ( i.e. , no jump )",
    "we obtain @xmath162 , while for @xmath163 au we find @xmath164 ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus , the ratio increased by a factor of 2.5 when neptune s jump was accounted for in the model .",
    "the main difference between these two cases is that the probability of capture on a stable orbit in the 3:2 resonance , @xmath165 , is @xmath166 for @xmath161 and @xmath167 for @xmath163 au .",
    "[ the probabilities are normalized here to one particle in the original disk below 30 au . ]",
    "we looked into this issue in detail and found that the change of @xmath165 was mainly contributed by neptune s jump .",
    "as a consequence of neptune s jump , the 3:2 resonant objects captured during the previous stage were released from the resonance .",
    "interestingly , however , many bodies were captured into the 3:2 resonance from the scattered disk immediately after neptune s jump , when the 3:2 resonance suddenly moved into a new orbital location , and during the subsequent slow migration of neptune .",
    "this explains why the @xmath168 ratio did not change more substantially .",
    "the probability of capture in the main belt , @xmath169 , also changed , but the change was minor ( @xmath170 for @xmath161 and @xmath171 for @xmath163 au ; table 1 ) .",
    "a similar result holds for case 2 with smooth migration , where @xmath172 for @xmath161 and @xmath173 for @xmath163 au .",
    "these values are somewhat higher that those obtained in case 1 perhaps suggesting that @xmath168 might increase further if even shorter migration timescales were used .",
    "the short migration timescales are not plausible , however , because they do not satisfy the inclination constraint ( nesvorn 2015a ) . given these results , we conclude that the effect of neptune s jump can help , but it is insufficient in itself to resolve the resonance overpopulation problem .",
    "this is because even in the smooth migration cases with @xmath163 au , the 3:2 resonance is still strongly overpopulated , by a factor of @xmath15 - 10 relative to hcs .",
    "other resonances , such as the 2:1 or 5:2 , are overpopulated by a significant factor as well .",
    "we therefore proceed by considering the cases with grainy migration .",
    "figure [ grainy ] shows some of our best results for the grainy migration .",
    "these results were obtained for case 1 ( @xmath99 myr and @xmath100  myr ) and 1000 twoplutos . here , @xmath174 for both @xmath161 and @xmath163 au , in a close match to cfeps observations .",
    "this is encouraging .",
    "neptune s jump does not seem to have much to do with this result , because @xmath175 for @xmath161 and @xmath176 for @xmath163  au .",
    "these two values are similar and the small difference between them probably reflects some minor difference in the planetary migration histories .",
    "neptune s jump has only a small effect here , because the case with grainy migration encourages late captures with many bodies being captured _ after _ the instability .",
    "the results for the case-1 grainy migration with 4000 plutos are similar to those reported above for 1000 twoplutos .",
    "the ones obtained for 1000 and 2000 plutos are intermediate showing a clear progression from the smooth migration case to cases with an increased migration graininess ( table 1 ) .",
    "the main trend is that @xmath165 drops when more and more plutos are included .",
    "for case 1 with 1000 plutos , @xmath177 for @xmath40 and @xmath178 for @xmath43  au . with 2000 or 4000 plutos , or 1000 twoplutos , @xmath179-@xmath180 , which represents only a small fraction of @xmath181 obtained with the smooth migration .",
    "this change is attributed to the jittery motion of the 3:2 resonance that accompanies neptune s grainy migration ( murray - clay & chiang 2006 ) . due to this jitter , many bodies captured into the resonance during the earlier stages were later released from the resonance , because their libration amplitude increased beyond the limits required for the orbital stability ( @xmath160 ; nesvorn & roig 2001 ) . the distribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance is discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the hc capture probability also changes when the migration graininess is increased in the model . with case 1 and 1000 plutos , @xmath182-@xmath183 , about a factor of 2 higher than in the smooth migration case .",
    "the capture probability increases further , to @xmath184 , when 2000 or 4000 plutos are included .",
    "together , the increasing @xmath169 and decreasing @xmath165 lead to @xmath168 values that are more in line with observations . the best fit to observations , with @xmath185 - 4 , occurs for the case-1 simulations with 2000 and 4000 plutos ( table  1 ) .",
    "it is difficult to infer the precise number of pluto - mass bodies with more confidence .",
    "on one hand , additional observations are needed to better constrain the @xmath168 ratio in the present kuiper belt . on the other hand , the massive planetesimals in the original disk",
    "must have had a range of masses , while here we represent their size distribution by a delta function .",
    "a more realistic modeling with a continuous mass distribution of massive planetesimals is left for future work .",
    "see gladman & chan ( 2006 ) for a modeling work of the effect of very massive planetesimals .",
    "for an outer disk with mass @xmath56 - 20 @xmath3 , @xmath186 in our reference case with grainy migration implies the hc mass @xmath187 - 0.012 @xmath3 , while the mass inferred from observations is @xmath188 @xmath3 ( fraser et al .",
    "this is an excellent agreement .",
    "since the model population of plutinos in the 3:2 resonance has the right proportion relative to the hcs , as discussed above , this implies that the plutino mass obtained in the simulation is also approximately correct .    the case 2 with @xmath58 myr and @xmath59  myr shows trends in many ways similar to those discussed for case 1 above .",
    "the principal effect of faster migration rates is to produce the @xmath169 values that are a factor of @xmath12 larger than in case 1 ( for the same level of graininess ) , and @xmath165 values that are somewhat smaller .",
    "together , these trends make it easier to obtain the observed @xmath185 - 4 with a lower level of graininess .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2000 ] , where we show the orbital distributions obtained with 2000 plutos .",
    "we find that @xmath189 in case 1 and @xmath190 in case 2 .",
    "thus , while the case 1 with 2000 plutos produces a ratio that is slightly lower than the one indicated by observations , the case 2 with 2000 plutos overshoots it .",
    "the best results in case 2 were obtained with 1000 plutos in the original disk . in this case , @xmath191 for @xmath40 and @xmath192 for @xmath43 au ( table 1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the statistics inferred from observations of the resonant and non - resonant populations in the kuiper belt implies that the massive planetesimal disk below 30  au contained 1000 - 4000 plutos .",
    "the combined probability that a planetesimal from the original disk below 30 au evolves on a kuiper belt orbit is @xmath1@xmath2 . with 1000 - 4000 plutos in the original disk",
    ", we would therefore expect that @xmath11 - 4 pluto - class objects should exist in the kuiper belt today , while two such objects are known ( pluto and eris ) .",
    "this is a reasonable agreement , but note that neither pluto or eris is a member of the hc population , while we would expect from our model that the pluto - size objects are preferentially deposited in the hc population .",
    "the expectations would be slightly different if a continuous mass distribution of massive planetesimals were considered .",
    "for example , it is plausible that the needed migration graininess was produced by the combined effect of 1000 plutos _ and _ 500 twoplutos .",
    "this would yield @xmath11 pluto and @xmath10.5 twoplutos in the kuiper belt today . obviously , these considerations are subject to the small number statistics .",
    "their main point is to show that the needed graininess from the @xmath168 constraint is not contradictory to having two pluto - class objects in the kuiper belt today .",
    "the implantation of the disk planetesimals into the kuiper belt is a multi - step dynamical process that was first pointed out in gomes ( 2003 ) , and is hereafter called the gomes mechanism . in the gomes mechanism , disk planetesimals are first scattered by neptune to @xmath630 au , where they can evolve onto orbits with large libration amplitudes in mean motion resonances .",
    "the secular dynamics inside the mean motion resonances , including the kozai cycles ( kozai 1962 ) , can subsequently act to raise the perihelion distance and decouple the orbits from neptune .",
    "finally , if neptune is still migrating , bodies can be released from the resonances onto stable non - resonant orbits .",
    "while the gomes mechanism can operate for a wide range of migration parameters , nesvorn ( 2015a ) found that the inclination constrain requires that neptune is given sufficient time to act on the scattered bodies and increase their orbital inclinations _ before _",
    "bodies decouple from neptune ( the kozai cycles inside mean motion resonances also contribute to increasing the orbital inclinations , but they are not the principal factor ) . hence it is required that neptune s migration was slow .",
    "nesvorn ( 2015a ) used a slightly different migration setup from the one utilized here .",
    "the migration in their case was smooth ( i.e. , no massive bodies in the disk ) and characterized by a single migration phase with the starting position of neptune @xmath16 and e - folding migration timescale @xmath193 .",
    "they found that the inclination constraint implies that @xmath194 au and @xmath7 myr .",
    "the migration recipe used in this work was described in section 2 .",
    "here we have two migration stages with a slow migration during the first stage , and even slower migration during the second stage .",
    "the migration timescales used for the two phases satisfy the inclination constraint because @xmath195 myr . at the end of the first phase",
    ", we assumed that the orbit of neptune may have changed discontinuously . and",
    ", in addition , our preferred migration mode is grainy .",
    "these differences could affect the inclination distribution .",
    "here we therefore test whether the orbital distribution obtained with our favored migration parameters satisfies the inclination constraint .",
    "figure [ cfeps ] illustrates how the orbital distribution of bodies obtained in our case-1 simulation ( @xmath99 myr , @xmath100 myr , @xmath43 au ) compares with observations .",
    "two cases are shown : ( 1 ) a grainy migration case with 1000 twoplutos , and ( 2 ) a smooth migration case for a reference .",
    "we used the cfeps detection simulator , as described in section 2.4 , and compared the simulated orbits with the actual cfeps detections .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory in the grainy case , where the distribution of the non - resonant orbits roughly follows the lines of constant perihelion distance such that a larger value of the semimajor axis implies larger eccentricity .",
    "this trend is a characteristic property of the hc population ( see nesvorn 2015a for a more detailed comparison of our model with the cfeps observations ) .",
    "the 3:2 resonance population obtained in the grainy migration case has a correct distribution of orbital eccentricities .",
    "moreover , as we discussed in section 3.1 , the hcs and resonant populations appear in the right proportion . for comparison ,",
    "the smooth migration case shown in fig .",
    "[ cfeps]a , b leads to an excessive number of detections in resonances , which is clearly incorrect .",
    "the inclination distribution obtained in the model is wide and roughly comparable to the one inferred from observations .",
    "a more careful comparison of the inclination distributions is presented in fig .",
    "[ idist ] , where the model distributions are shown to follow very closely the cfeps distributions .",
    "this is especially true for the inclination distribution of plutinos ( fig .",
    "[ idist]a ) , for which the k - s test gives a 84% probability that the simulated and observed distributions are being derived from the same underlying distribution .",
    "the agreement is somewhat less satisfactory for hcs , where the model distribution is slightly wider than the observed one and the k - s test gives a 23% probability .",
    "still , this is a satisfactory match .",
    "also , note that the inclination distribution is sensitive to the migration timescale , and slightly shorter migration timescales should lead to a better agreement ( nesvorn 2015a ) .    indeed , our case 2 with @xmath58 myr and @xmath59 myr yields a narrower inclination distributions of the hcs ( fig .",
    "[ idist2]b ) . in this case , the k - s test gives the 57% probability for plutinos and 80% probability for the hcs .",
    "the main difference with respect to case 1 is that the model distribution of hcs now represents a reasonable match to observations all the way down to @xmath196 , while in case 1 we were able to produce a satifactory fit only for @xmath197 ( nesvorn 2015a ) .",
    "this may indicate that the real migration timescales were closer to case  2 than to case 1 .    in case 1 with 2000 and 4000",
    "plutos the inclination distributions are similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ idist ] .",
    "all other cases studied here show narrower inclination distributions for plutinos .",
    "cases 1 and 2 with a smooth migration also show narrower inclination distributions of hcs , which nicely fit the observed distribution for @xmath198 , where the cfeps inclination distribution steeply raises , but fail to match the wide distribution for @xmath197 .",
    "this shows that there is some trade - off between the level of graininess and the migration timescale .",
    "any future attempt to closely match the inclination distribution will thus need to explore both these parameters with more resolution . here",
    "we content ourselves with showing that the general results published in nesvorn ( 2015a ) are valid even if neptune s migration was grainy .",

    "gladman et al . ( 2012 ) also pointed out that the distribution of @xmath158 inferred from the cfeps observations is very similar to the theoretical distribution reported in nesvorn & roig ( 2001 ) , where the 3:2 resonance was randomly populated , and the orbital distribution was dynamically evolved over 4 gyr ( with neptune on its current orbit ) .",
    "the number of resonant orbits increases with @xmath158 , because the resonant orbits with larger libration amplitudes represent a larger phase - space volume than the orbits with smaller libration amplitudes , and are therefore more populated to start with .",
    "there are fewer orbits with @xmath201 , because this is already close to the stability limit , and the original population was depleted when the orbits with @xmath201 evolved out of the resonance .",

    "we conclude that 1000 - 4000 plutos give the best fit to observations .",
    "it is encouraging to see that while this argument is independent of the one based on the population statistics ( section 3.1 ) , it leads to a similar inference about the number of pluto - sized objects . in any case , these results represent a significant improvement over those shown in fig .",

    "2014 ) , and lacks very large objects ( levison & stern 2001 ) . ]",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the unique physical and orbital properties is that the ccs formed and/or dynamically evolved by different processes than other trans - neptunian populations .",
    "here we consider a possibility that the ccs formed at @xmath640  au and survived neptune s early ` wild days ' relatively unharmed ( e.g. , kavelaars et al . 2009 , batygin et al . 2011 , wolff et al . 2012 ) .",

    "the 2:1 resonance was at @xmath044 au when neptune reached @xmath028  au . if neptune s semimajor axis changed by fraction of au at this point , perhaps because neptune was scattered off of another planet ( see fig .",

    "we therefore repeat the simulations of nesvorn ( 2015b ) to test whether the kernel can form even if the migration was grainy .",

    "for example , case 1 gives @xmath232 and @xmath233 for 2000 plutos , and @xmath234 - 5 and @xmath235 for 4000 plutos .",
    "the increased level of migration graininess therefore leads to lower values of @xmath236 and @xmath237 , which are in better agreement with observations ( gladman et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ; adams et al .",
    "this trend is mainly contributed by the lower value of @xmath165 when the migration is assumed to be grainy . on the other hand , if different migration timescales are considered for the same level of graininess , then the cases with faster migration rates tend to produce larger populations in the 2:1 ( @xmath238 au ) and 5:2 ( @xmath239 au ) resonances than the cases with slower migration rates .",
    "this trend is clearly visible in fig . [",
    "2000 ] , where the 2:1 and 5:2 resonances are more populated in case 2 ( @xmath58 myr and @xmath59 myr ) than in case 1 ( @xmath58 myr and @xmath59 myr ) .",
    "in an attempt to develop a consistent model of neptune s migration , we previously proposed that the wide inclination distribution of orbits inferred from observations can be explained if neptune started inward of @xmath240 au , and slowly ( e - folding timescale @xmath7  myr ) migrated into a massive disk with the outer edge at @xmath030 au . moreover , we suggested that the concentration of low - inclination orbits at @xmath044 au , known as the kuiper belt kernel , can be explained if neptune s semimajor axis discontinuously changed by @xmath00.5 au when neptune reached @xmath241 au , perhaps because neptune was scattered off of another planet ( nm12 ) .",
    "here we pointed out that all previous models of the kuiper belt formation suffered from the resonance overpopulation problem , where the resonant populations were overpopulated when compared to observations .",
    "we showed that this problem can be resolved if neptune s migration was grainy as a result of close encounters of neptune with massive , pluto - class planetesimals .",
    "here we considered the pluto - class planetesimals because we have direct observational evidence that planetesimals such as pluto or eris exist in the present kuiper belt .",
    "it is possible that neptune s grainy migration was contributed by objects much more massive than pluto / eris .",
    "we were not strongly motivated to consider , for example , an earth - mass object in this work ( gladman & chan 2006 ) , because the overpopulation problem can be resolved by considering a reasonable number of smaller mass bodies ( plutos or twoplutos ) .",
    "we thus really do not need to invoke effects of very massive planetesimals or planets .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that such massive objects formed in the original disk , affected the dynamical evolution of neptune , and helped to shape the orbital structure of the kuiper belt ( e.g. , gladman & chan 2006 ) .",
    "more detailed investigations of a continuous distribution of massive planetesimals , including cases with the earth - class bodies , is left for future work .",
    "the best results were obtained if the massive disk below 30 au was assumed to have contained 1000 - 4000 plutos , or @xmath11000 bodies twice as massive as pluto .",
    "the total mass in these massive objects should thus be @xmath12 - 8 @xmath3 , while the most plausible total mass of the disk was found to be @xmath020 @xmath3 in nm12 .",
    "this means that the pluto - class objects should have represented @xmath010 - 40% of the original disk mass .",
    "the remaining @xmath060 - 90% of the mass was predominantly in the 100-km - class bodies , as inferred from the size distribution of the present kuiper belt ( e.g. , bernstein et al . 2004 ) . to obtain this mass partitioning ,",
    "a relatively steep size distribution of the planetesimal disk inferred from observations for diameters @xmath0100 - 500 km can not continue for @xmath242 km , because in that case the total mass in the @xmath242-km bodies would be negligible .",
    "instead , the distribution needs to bulge at large sizes .",
    "figure [ sfd ] shows a reconstructed size distribution of the planetesimal disk below @xmath030  au .",
    "we used several constraints here . for the intermediate sizes @xmath243  km",
    ", we adopted the size distribution suggested by fraser et al .",
    "( 2014 ) from observations of the kuiper belt and jupiter trojans .",
    "this size distribution can be approximated by two power laws with a break at @xmath244 km , a steeper slope for larger sizes ( cummulative power index @xmath245 - 5.0 ) , and a shallower slope for smaller sizes ( cumulative index @xmath246 - 2 ) . to estimate how the size distribution may have looked like for @xmath242 km",
    ", we assumed that there were 1000 - 4000 plutos in the original disk , as required from the results of this study , and connected the size distribution from @xmath247 km to pluto s diameter ( @xmath248 km ) .",
    "note that the shallow slope of the sfd in this range is consistent with observations of large kbos ( brown 2008 ) . the number of objects with @xmath249 km drops in fig .",
    "[ sfd ] , but this part of the size distribution is unconstrained . the size distribution may have been shallower in this size range including some very massive objects in the original disk ( e.g. , gladman & chan 2006 ) .",
    "only a few constraints exist for @xmath250 km .",
    "one of these constraints was derived from the population of the jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) , as most recently described in brasser & morbidelli ( 2013 ) .",
    "the argument was used to estimate that there were between @xmath1@xmath251 and @xmath1@xmath252 objects in the original disk with @xmath253 km ( morbidelli & rickman 2015 ) .",
    "if correct , it would require that the shallow size distribution below the break at @xmath244 km needs to steepen up for small sizes .",
    "here we satisfy this constraint by postulating a cumulative index of 3.0 for @xmath254 km . note that this contradicts the size distribution inferred from the observations of active jfcs , which is more shallow for @xmath254 km ( cumulative index @xmath02 ; e.g. , lowry et al .",
    "at least part of this difference could presumably be explained by devolatization and surficial mass loss of cometary nuclei ( belton 2014 ) .",
    "finally , the detection of a single occultation event in the archival data of the hst guiding camera can be used to estimate the number of sub - kilometer kbos ( schlichting et al .",
    "2009 ) . from this",
    "we infer that there would need to be @xmath1@xmath255-@xmath256 bodies with @xmath257 km in the original disk .    the size distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ sfd ] was normalized to have @xmath53 @xmath3 , which is the preferred disk mass from nm12 .",
    "different populations of small bodies in the solar system have different probabilities to dynamically evolve from the original disk to reach their current orbits .",
    "for example , the capture probability of jupiter trojans was estimated to be @xmath258 for each particle in the original disk ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2013 ) . by scaling down by this factor the size distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ sfd ] , we find that the largest captured object should have @xmath259 km . for comparison , the largest jupiter trojan , 624 hector , is roughly 230 km accross .",
    "this illustrates that the normalization of the reconstructed profile from nm12 is consistent with the present population of jupiter trojans .",
    "also , the probability that a disk planetesimal is captured as an irregular satellite of jupiter is @xmath260 according to nesvorn et al .",
    "this implies that the largest irregular satellite of jupiter should have @xmath261 km , while himalia is only slightly larger ( @xmath262 km ) .    the size distribution profile shown in fig .",
    "[ sfd ] has several interesting implications for the accretion and collisional evolution of kbos .",
    "first , the hump in the profile at the largest sizes , with 1000 - 4000 plutos , probably hints on a runaway - type mode of accretion of these largest objects .",
    "it is fairly similar to the size distribution profiles obtained in the classical collisional coagulation models ( e.g. , stern & colwell 1997 , kenyon et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether the pebble accretion ( e.g. , lambrechts & johansen 2012 ) , which is a very efficient mechanism for growing large solid objects in the protoplanetary disks , could generate the hump .",
    "the size distribution at small sizes should have been modified by collisional grinding .",
    "the importance of collisional grinding mainly depends on the physical strenghts of kbos , the dynamical structure of the outer planetesimal disk , and the time elapsed between the dispersal of the protoplanetary nebula and neptune s migration into the disk . using different assumptions",
    ", the published studies of collisional grinding reached different conclusions ( e.g. , pan & sari 2004 , fraser 2009 , nesvorn et al .",
    "if neptune s migration into the planetesimal disk was delayed , as required if the planetary instability was responsible for the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ; e.g. , gomes et al .",
    "2005 , bottke et al .",
    "2012 ) , more time would be available for the modification of the size distribution by collisional grinding ( @xmath0300 - 600 myr , depending on when exactly the lhb started ) .",
    "our main concern with this issue is whether a massive planetesimal disk could have survived a long period of collisional grinding , and have the estimated mass @xmath4 @xmath3 when the instability happened .",
    "at least two important approximations were adopted in this work : ( 1 ) the gravitational effects of planetesimals were not explicitly included in the simulations ( except for the implicit assumption that the small planetesimals drive neptune s migration and that the large planetesimals are the source of a jitter in the evolution of neptune s semimajor axis ) , and ( 2 ) the direct gravitational effects of the hypothetical fifth giant planet were not accounted for in the simulations except that we ( optionally ) activated neptune s jump in some simulations to see whether neptune s jump can resolve the resonance overpopulation problem . here we argue that none of these assumptions can affect the main results of our work . as for ( 1 ) , the collective gravitational effect of planetesimals can speed up the apsidal and nodal precession of neptune s orbits , and slightly alter the degree of the secular excitation of orbits in the kuiper belt ( batygin et al .",
    "2012 ) . while this may be important to some extent for ccs",
    ", whose clustered orbital distribution would more easily reveal signs of small perturbations , this effect is probably insignificant for the resonant populations and hcs , which suffered much larger orbital changes due to other major dynamical processes .    as for ( 2 ) , the five planet model of the early solar system is , despite its various successes , not universally accepted and much more work will need to be done to establish things more firmly .",
    "it is thus probably sensible that here we did not include the direct effects of the fifth planet on planetesimals .",
    "instead , we showed in this work that the resonance overpopulation problem can be resolved if we include a reasonable number of pluto - class planetesimals in the original trans - planetary disk , and let neptune s orbit react to the gravitational perturbations during close encounters with these bodies . about half of our simulations were done with neptune s jump , which was presumably caused by an encounter of neptune with the fifth planet ( nm12 ) .",
    "the basic motivation for activating neptune s jump in some of our simulations was to test whether the jump can resolve , in itself , the resonance overpolulation problem as suggested in our previous work ( nesvorn 2015a ) .",
    "we found that it can not , because large populations of bodies are captured into resonances _ after _",
    "neptune s jump , during the subsequent migration of neptune .",
    "since the fifth planet was presumably ejected from the solar system near the time of neptune s jump ( nm12 ) , it can not affect things at later times .",
    "including or ignoring its direct effects on planetesimals is therefore irrelevant for the main thesis of this work .",
    "we plan on conducting more self - consistent simulations in the near future .",
    "this work was supported by nasa s outer planet research ( opr ) program .",
    "the work of david vokrouhlick was partly supported by the czech grant agency ( grant ga13 - 01308s ) . the cpu - expensive simulations in this work were performed on nasa s pleiades supercomputer , and on the computer cluster tiger at the institute of astronomy of the charles university , prague ."
