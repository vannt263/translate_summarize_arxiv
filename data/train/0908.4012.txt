    "photoacoustic imaging is a recent medical imaging technique combining the large contrast between healthy and unhealthy tissues of their optical parameters with the high spatial resolution of acoustic ( ultrasonic ) waves .",
    "electromagnetic radiation , sent through a domain of interest , generates some heating and a resulting thermal expansion of the underlying tissues .",
    "the mechanical displacement of the tissues generates acoustic waves , which then propagate through the medium and are recorded by an array of detectors ( ultrasound transducers ) .",
    "the photoacoustic effect is now being actively investigated for its promising applications in medical imaging .",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite for recent reviews on the practical and theoretical aspects of the method .    in an idealized setting revisited below",
    ", the electromagnetic source is a very short pulse that propagates through the domain at a scale faster than that of the acoustic waves .",
    "the measured acoustic signals may then be seen as being emitted by unknown initial conditions . a first step in the inversion",
    "thus consists in reconstructing this initial condition by solving an inverse source problem for a wave equation .",
    "this inversion is relatively simple when the sound speed is constant and full measurements are available .",
    "it becomes much more challenging when only partial measurements are available and the sound speed is not constant ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a second step consists of analyzing the initial condition reconstructed in the first step and extracting information about the optical coefficients of the domain of interest .",
    "the second step is much less studied .",
    "the energy deposited by the radiation is given by the product of @xmath1 , the attenuation in the tissue and of @xmath2 , the radiation intensity .",
    "the question is therefore what information on the medium may be extracted from @xmath3 .",
    "the product can be plotted as a proxy for @xmath4 when @xmath5 is more or less uniform .",
    "this , however , generates image distortions as has been reported e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the extraction of e.g. @xmath4 from @xmath3 remains an essentially unsolved problem .",
    "two different regimes of radiation propagation should then be considered . in thermoacoustic tomography ( tat ) ,",
    "low frequency ( radio - frequency ) waves with wavelengths much larger than the domain of interest , are being used .",
    "we do not consider this modality here .",
    "rather , we assume that high frequency radiation is generated in the near infra red ( nir ) spectrum .",
    "nir photons have the advantage that they propagate over fairly large distances before being absorbed .",
    "moreover , their absorption properties have a very large contrast between healthy and cancerous tissues . in this regime",
    ", @xmath2 may be interpreted as a spatial density of photons propagating in the domain of interest .",
    "the density of photons is then modeled by a transport equation that accounts for photon propagation , absorption , and scattering ; see below .",
    "this paper concerns the reconstruction of the optical parameters in a steady - state transport equation from knowledge of @xmath6 .",
    "the derivation of the transport equation given in below is addressed in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "we are concerned here with the setting of measurements of @xmath7 for different radiation patterns .",
    "our most general measurement operator @xmath8 is then the operator which to arbitrary radiation patterns at the domain s boundary maps the deposited energy @xmath7 .",
    "we analyze the reconstruction of the absorption and scattering properties of the photons from knowledge of @xmath8 . the main tool used in the analysis",
    "is the decomposition of @xmath8 into singular components , in a spirit very similar to what was done e.g. in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the presence of boundary measurements rather than internal measurements .",
    "the most singular component is related to the ballistic photons .",
    "we show that the analysis of that component allows us to reconstruct the attenuation coefficient @xmath4 and the spatial component @xmath9 of the scattering coefficient .",
    "the anisotropic behavior of scattering is partially determined by the second most singular term in @xmath8 , which accounts for photons having scattered only once in the domain .",
    "although the full phase function of the scattering coefficient can not be reconstructed with the techniques described in this paper , we show that the anisotropy coefficient @xmath0 that appears in the classical henyey - greenstein phase function is uniquely determined by the measurements in spatial dimensions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , all the parameters that can be reconstructed are obtained with hlder - type stability .",
    "we present the stability results in detail .",
    "when scattering is very large , then radiation is best modeled by a diffusion equation characterized by two unknown coefficients , the diffusion coefficient @xmath12 and the attenuation coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "this regime is briefly mentioned in section [ sec : diff ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : main ] is devoted to the derivation of the stationary inverse transport problem starting from the transient equation for the short electromagnetic pulse . the main uniqueness and stability results",
    "are also presented in detail in this section .",
    "the derivation of the uniqueness and stability results is postponed to the technical sections [ sec : forward ] and [ sec : inverse ] .",
    "the former section is devoted to the decomposition of the albedo operator into singular components .",
    "useful results on the transport equation are also recalled .",
    "the latter section presents in detail the proofs of the stability results given in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "the propagation of radiation is modeled by the following radiative transfer equation @xmath13 we assume here that @xmath14 is compactly supported in @xmath15 and in @xmath16 outside of a bounded domain of interest @xmath17 we wish to probe .",
    "the domain @xmath17 is assumed to be an open subset of @xmath18 with @xmath19 boundary . for the sake of simplicity , @xmath17 is also assumed to be convex although all uniqueness and stability results in this paper remain valid when @xmath17 is not convex . here , @xmath20 is light speed , @xmath21 is the unit sphere in @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the transport operator defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total attenuation coefficient and @xmath26 is the scattering coefficient .",
    "both coefficients are assumed to be non - negative and bounded ( by a constant @xmath27 ) throughout the paper .",
    "we define @xmath28 we also refer to @xmath9 as a scattering coefficient and define @xmath4 as the intrinsic attenuation coefficient .",
    "we assume that for ( almost ) all @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath31 for ( almost ) all @xmath32 .",
    "the optical coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath25 are the unknown coefficients inside @xmath17 that we would like to reconstruct by probing the domain @xmath17 by radiation modeled by @xmath14 . in photo - acoustics ,",
    "the emitted radiation generates some heating inside the domain @xmath17 .",
    "heating then causes some dilation , which mechanically induces acoustic waves .",
    "such acoustic waves are measured at the boundary of the domain @xmath17 .",
    "after time reversion , the latter measurements allow us to infer the intensity of the source of heating .",
    "this gives us internal measurements of the solution @xmath33 of the transport equation .",
    "the objective of this paper is to understand which parts of the optical parameters may be reconstructed from such information and with which stability .    before doing so , we need an accurate description of the propagation of the acoustic waves generated by the radiative heating .",
    "the proper model for the acoustic pressure is given by the following wave equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dalembertian defined as @xmath36 with @xmath37 the sound speed , where @xmath38 is a coupling coefficient assumed to be constant and known , and where @xmath39 is the thermal energy deposited by the radiation given by @xmath40 not surprisingly , the amount of heating generated by radiation is proportional to the amount of radiation @xmath33 and to the rate of ( intrinsic ) absorption @xmath4 .",
    "as it stands , the problem of the reconstruction of the source term @xmath39 inside @xmath17 from measurements of @xmath41 on the boundary @xmath42 is ill - posed , because @xmath43 is @xmath44dimensional whereas information on @xmath45 is @xmath46dimensional . what allows us to simplify the inverse acoustic problem is the difference of time scales between the sound speed @xmath37 and the light speed @xmath20 .",
    "to simplify the analysis , we assume that @xmath37 is constant and rescale time so that @xmath47",
    ". then @xmath20 in is replaced by @xmath48 , which in water is of order @xmath49 .",
    "the transport scale is therefore considerably faster than the acoustic scale . as a consequence ,",
    "when the radiation source term @xmath14 is supported on a scale much faster than the acoustic scale , then @xmath33 is also supported on a scale much faster than the acoustic scale and as a result @xmath39 can be approximated by a source term supported at @xmath50 .",
    "more specifically , let us assume that the source of radiation is defined at the scale @xmath51 so that @xmath52 is replaced by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function compactly supported in @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "the transport solution then solves @xmath57 with @xmath47 , we verify that @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath33 solves with @xmath60 . because @xmath61",
    ", we verify that @xmath33 decays exponentially in time .",
    "this shows that @xmath58 lives at the time scale @xmath62 so that @xmath63 is also primarily supported in the vicinity of @xmath50 .",
    "let us formally derive the equation satisfied by @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a test function and define @xmath67 as the standard inner product on @xmath68 .",
    "then we find that @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath33 defined in and where we have used the change of variables @xmath71 .",
    "the latter term is therefore equal to @xmath72 up to a small term for @xmath73 sufficiently smooth .",
    "we thus find that @xmath64 converges weakly as @xmath65 to the solution @xmath74 of the following wave equation @xmath75    the inverse problem for the wave equation is now well - posed .",
    "the objective is to reconstruct @xmath76 for @xmath77 from measurements of @xmath41 for @xmath15 and @xmath78 .",
    "such an inverse problem has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite for a recent inversion with ( known ) variable sound speed .    in this paper , we assume that @xmath76 has been reconstructed accurately as a functional of the radiation source @xmath79 .",
    "our objective is to understand which parts of the optical parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be reconstructed from knowledge of @xmath76 for a given set of radiations @xmath79 . note that we will allow ourselves to generate many such @xmath79 and thus consider a multi - measurement setting .",
    "the time average @xmath80 satisfies a closed - form steady state transport equation given by @xmath81 as can be seen by averaging in time since @xmath82 .      since @xmath79 is assumed to be supported outside of the domain @xmath17 and scattering @xmath83 outside of @xmath17 ,",
    "the above transport equation may be replaced by a boundary value problem of the form @xmath84 where the sets of outgoing and incoming boundary radiations are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the outward normal to @xmath17 at @xmath78 and @xmath87 is an appropriate set of incoming radiation conditions obtained by solving @xmath88 outside of @xmath17 assuming that @xmath89 is known outside of @xmath17 .",
    "we are now ready to state the inverse transport problem of interest in this paper .",
    "it is well known that admits a unique solution in @xmath90 when @xmath91 , where @xmath92 with @xmath93 the surface measure on @xmath42 .",
    "we thus define the albedo operator as @xmath94 the inverse transport problem with angularly averaged internal measurements thus consists of understanding what can be reconstructed from the optical parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 from complete or partial knowledge of the albedo operator @xmath8 .",
    "we also wish to understand the stability of such reconstructions .",
    "the inverse transport problem and its stability properties are solved by looking at a decomposition of the albedo operator into singular components .",
    "let @xmath95 be the schwartz kernel of the albedo operator @xmath8 , i.e. , the distribution such that @xmath96 the kernel @xmath95 corresponds to measurements of @xmath7 at @xmath77 for a radiation condition concentrated at @xmath97 and propagating with direction @xmath98 .",
    "such a kernel can thus be obtained as a limit of physical experiments with sources concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath99 and detectors concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath16 .",
    "the kernel @xmath95 accounts for radiation propagation inside @xmath17 , including all orders of scattering of the radiation with the underlying structure .",
    "it turns out that we can extract from @xmath95 singular components that are not affected by multiple scattering .",
    "such singular components provide useful information on the optical coefficients .",
    "let us define the ballistic part of transport as the solution of @xmath100 then for @xmath101 , we define iteratively @xmath102    this allows us to decompose the albedo operator as @xmath103 where @xmath104 for @xmath105 are defined as @xmath8 in with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath106 and where @xmath107 is defined as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath109 is the contribution in @xmath8 of particles that have not scattered at all with the underlying structure while @xmath110 is the contribution of particles that have scattered exactly once .",

    "it turns out that @xmath130 is also more singular than @xmath113 in the sense that it is asymptotically much larger than @xmath113 in the vicinity of the support of the ballistic part @xmath129 . that this is the case is the object of the following result ( see also lemma [ lem : norm_scat ] and for `` @xmath133 '' ) . for any topological space @xmath134",

    ", the singular behaviors of @xmath129 and @xmath130 allow us to extract them from the full measurements @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , such an extraction can be carried out in a stable fashion , in the sense that small errors in the measurement of the albedo operator translates into small errors in the extraction of the terms characterizing @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "we want to obtain error estimates on the useful functionals of the optical parameters in terms of appropriate metrics for @xmath155 .",
    "we obtain the following two results .",
    "the first result pertains to the stability of the ballistic term in the albedo operator :    [ thm : ballistic ] let @xmath8 and @xmath150 be two albedo operators and @xmath139 .",
