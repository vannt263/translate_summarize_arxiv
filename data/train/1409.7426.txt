    "the hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) experiment in @xmath0 @xcite , aimed to measure the angular size of a star by performing correlated detections , paved the way towards the development of the field of quantum optics . from 1956 until now a numerous series of remarkable experiments @xcite based on high order correlation measurements with thermal sources have been performed , and important applications in high - precision imaging @xcite and information processing @xcite have been highlighted .    this fast advancement in experimental technologies based on thermal light interferometry calls for a general description of multi - boson correlation interferometry with thermal sources . here",
    "we fully analyze hbt - like experiments for arbitrary orders of correlation measurements , arbitrary passive linear optical interferometers and arbitrary spectral distributions of the thermal sources .",
    "our analysis also brings up an interesting connection with the so - called _ boson sampling problem _ ( bsp ) @xcite , where the probability of finding @xmath1 single input bosons in @xmath2 output ports of a @xmath3-port interferometer depends on permanents of random complex matrices @xcite .    differently from the bsp , multi - order correlation measurements at the output of arbitrary interferometers rely additionally on the times the detections occur @xcite .",
    "further , for multi - mode thermal input sources , the detection rates are connected with permanents of positive semi - definite matrices , whose elements depend not only on the interferometer evolution but also on the average rate of bosons emitted by each source and on the detection times .",
    "moreover , we show that these permanents arise from the interference of all multi - photon quantum paths from the sources to the detectors .    after giving a general perspective about _ multi - boson correlation interferometry _",

    "[ sec : singlematrixformulation ] and [ sec : equivalence ] , we derive two equivalent , interesting formulations of the @xmath1-order correlation functions in terms of matrix permanents depending on the interferometer evolution . finally , we analyze the probability rates of multi - order correlation measurements for approximatively equal detection times in section  [ sec : equaldetectiontimes ] , address the trivial case of thermal sources with equal average boson production rates in section  [ sec : complexity ] and conclude with final remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the formulation of mbci experiments of any given order @xmath1 is the following ( see fig .  [ fig : linearinterferometersinglefock ] ) : first , we prepare a linear @xmath3-port interferometer with bosonic sources ; secondly , we consider correlated detection events in which @xmath4 single bosons are detected in a @xmath1-port sample @xmath5 from the total @xmath3 output ports at joint detection times @xmath6 , independently of the detection outcomes for the remaining @xmath7 detectors .     with a random linear interferometer with @xmath8 ports and bosonic sources .",

    "we consider here the case of photonic sources , although our results can be easily extended to atomic interferometers with bosonic sources .",

    "in the limit of identical mean photon rates , we find that the property @xmath93 holds for the matrices @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prodmatrixdefinition ] ) .",
    "further , since eq .   is independent of the detection times @xmath94 , it must also correspond to the expression   in the condition of equal mean photon rates .",
    "this yields the second property @xmath95 for the matrices @xmath91 in eq . .",
    "these two properties arise since the photon - counting probability rates for sources with equal average intensity are physically independent from the interferometer .",
    "we performed a full analysis of multi - boson correlation interferometry of arbitrary order @xmath96 , where @xmath11 are the ports of a random passive linear interferometer , for thermal sources with arbitrary spectral distributions .",
    "we showed that the probability rates of detecting single bosons in at least @xmath87 output ports , with @xmath96 , are proportional to the permanents of positive semi - definite @xmath54 matrices , leading to an interesting connection with the boson sampling problem .",
    "each matrix is given by the hadamard product ( product of the corresponding entries ) of a time - dependent matrix , describing the degree of correlation in time between the measurements , and the interference - dependent matrix associated with the interferometer evolution and the average photon rate of each source .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that , for approximately equal detection times , the @xmath1-boson probability rates can be cast as a time - dependent weighted sum of modulus squared permanents of matrices with interference - like elements depending only on the interferometer evolution .",
    "indeed , each different permanent is associated with a possible physical configuration for the number of bosons each source contributes to the detection and describes the interference of all the corresponding multi - boson quantum paths from the sources to the detectors .",
    "the higher the number of sources contributing to the joint detection is , the larger the number of corresponding interfering multi - path amplitudes is .    in conclusion , our general analysis of multi - boson correlation interferometry with thermal sources provides a deeper insight in the fundamental physics of multi - boson interference for arbitrary order hbt - like experiments where highly interesting correlation effects emerge .",
