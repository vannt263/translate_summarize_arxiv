    "four - terminal resistance measurements on films of 30 , 50 , and 480 nm in thickness show the superconducting transitions around 7.2k with the width of @xmath4 mk , indicating little degradation in @xmath5 from the bulk .",
    "the present tdts ( time domain terahertz spectroscopy ) measurements@xcite are carried out with the use of a commercial spectrometer ( rt-20000 , tochigi nikon co. ltd ) based on standard transmission techniques , covering the frequency range of 0.15 - 2.0 thz . the real part @xmath6 and the imaginary part @xmath7 of the optical conductivity @xmath8 are directly evaluated by numerically analyzing both the amplitude and phase of transmitted terawaves through the substrate ( 0.5 mm in thickness ) with and without the film .",
    "the data will be presented for the 50 nm film most systematically studied .    for a correlated electron system , specifically here a coupled , electron - phonon system , it has become standard practice to represent the optical conductivity @xmath9 [ with @xmath10 , the temperature , and @xmath11 , the photon energy ] in terms of an optical self - energy in analogy to the quasiparticle self - energy which is introduced to include interactions in the one - particle green s function . by definition ,",

    "we note a kink in both data and theory at an intermediate frequency which decreases in frequency , with increasing temperature .",
    "this arises because there are two separate absorption processes possible . at the lowest frequencies",
    "there can be direct absorption from the thermally excited quasiparticles .",
    "this contribution provides a drude - like peak to @xmath6 . at frequencies above twice the gap ,",
    "direct absorption through the creation of two excitations out of the condenstate becomes possible .",
    "in addition , there is another incoherent phonon - assisted contribution to the absorption and this is the part of most interest in this work .",
    "however , it can not easily be separated out of the real part of the conductivity .",
    "we will see that consideration of the optical self - energy @xmath47 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig2 ] ) helps in this regard .",
    "first , however , we note that the fit between theory and the data is very good at low frequency in all cases .",

    "this is important given that in the past , it is has been argued that vertex corrections and other aspects of electromagnetic theory were needed to understand the data in pb and yet this appears not to be the case here . with this level of agreement between theory and data , we should now be able to proceed to test for more subtle effects due to the phonon - assisted processes in the absorption .    to see separately , more clearly , the role of the coherent absorption processes included in bcs theory and described by the coherent part of the electron green s function @xmath50 , and the incoherent phonon - assisted processes described by the incoherent part of @xmath50 , it is convenient to deal with the real and imaginary parts of the optical self - energy defined in eq .",

    "to agree with the experimental data it was necessary to include an impurity scattering rate of 22 mev .",
    "this is the only scattering that would be included in a bcs theory for which the normal state conductivity would be a pure drude form .",
    "the optical scattering rate corresponding to this drude is a constant flat line independent of frequency and temperature .",
    "we see clearly in the curve for the normal state that significant deviations from this constant occur .",
    "these are due to the boson - assisted processes which become even more important as the frequency is increased beyond the range of the data shown .",

    "( [ eq : taueinstein ] ) ) even for a distributed @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "turning next to the superconducting state ( thin red curve , top frame ) , we see larger boson structures with the vertical arrows indicating the transverse and longitudinal peaks in the phonon frequency distribution @xmath58 of pb shifted by @xmath55 .",
    "these are preceded by a coherence peak in the region above @xmath55 which reflects the increased density of final states for scattering in the superconducting as compared with normal state .",
    "this curve is strikingly different from the dot - dashed black curve which would apply to a bcs superconductor .",
    "an interesting comparison is offered in the dotted curves which were also calculated with the pb @xmath59 spectrum , but without residual scattering , i.e. @xmath60 . an important point to note",
    "is that no coherence peak is seen in the dotted thin red curve because this is an impurity effect , but at higher frequencies the dotted curve is very close to the solid one once it is displaced upward by 22 mev .",
    "this holds exactly for the normal state data , blue dotted ( pure ) and solid ( with residual scattering ) . returning to the lower frame of fig .",

    "note that as @xmath27 @xmath61 which is just slightly larger than the zero temperature quasiparticle mass renormalization for pb , which is 1.55 .",
    "this is expected since it is known that the mass renormalization increases slightly with increasing temperature .",
    "furthermore , the normal state effective mass has only a small frequency dependence predicted and this is observed .",
    "there is no dependence on impurity scattering as it drops out of this curve .",
    "( this fact can be understood simply .",
    "the kramers - kronig ( kk ) transform of a constant is zero so that a constant scattering rate corresponds to no mass renormalization . )",
    "this is in striking contrast to the superconducting state for which impurities profoundly alter the optical curves .",
    "this is seen in the other two curves for @xmath54 ( red hexagons ) and @xmath62 ( black squares ) .",
    "note first the very large peaks which occur at twice the gap edge @xmath55 .",
    "these peaks have not been emphasized before .",
    "they would not be there in the clean case ( no impurities ) .",
    "their origin is easily understood from our results for the scattering rate shown in the top frame .",
    "we see the sharp , almost vertical , rise in @xmath52 at @xmath55 with the energy scale of the rise given by the value of @xmath63 mev .",
    "the kk transform of a step at @xmath23 is a logarithm with a singularity at @xmath23 .",
    "the larger the step , the larger the log singularity .",
    "of course , here we do not quite have a vertical step and hence the corresponding peak in the effective mass is smeared .",
    "another feature to note is the @xmath27 limit of @xmath64 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath65 and that in the superconducting state in the limit of @xmath27 we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the electron density in the normal state and @xmath68 is the superfluid density at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath69 , direct strong - coupling calculations of @xmath70 show that it is very nearly equal to @xmath71 which leads to @xmath72 , same as for the normal state , and reflects the fact that only the coherent part of the optical conductivity participates in the superfluid condensation . returning to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam2 ] ) , one can verify that in the normal state , substitution of the drude form ( [ eq : sigdru ] ) again gives @xmath73 as we expect .",
    "if impurities are included , as we have done in our work , @xmath74 is no longer @xmath71 but in the dirty limit has instead the approximate form ( in renormalized bcs)@xcite @xmath75\\ ] ] for @xmath76 where @xmath77 $ ] , which gives @xmath78 . the exact numerical result ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , bottom frame ) is 9.5 at @xmath79 .",
    "most of the difference can be assigned to the small reduction in @xmath68 between @xmath69 and @xmath80 .    in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show additional theoretical results on the optical effective mass which range over a larger frequency interval beyond that covered by the thz data . the dot - dashed black curve is the bcs result ( for @xmath63 mev ) while the solid thin red curve includes as well the incoherent phonon - assisted holstein processes .",
    "we see clearly in this curve an image of the pb phonon frequency distribution with transverse and longitudinal phonon peaks shifted by @xmath55 indicated by vertical arrows .",
    "the thin red dotted lines were obtained for pure pb ( i.e. @xmath21 is set equal to zero and the only source of scattering comes from the inelastic part described by @xmath0 ) . in this case",

    "recently , there have been several discussions of sum rules on @xmath85 in the literature@xcite . in particular , it was noted that there exists a differential sum rule on the difference in optical scattering rate between the superconducting and normal state . defining the partial sum @xmath86 as @xmath87d\\omega^\\prime \\label{eq : i}\\ ] ]",
    "it can be shown@xcite that @xmath88 for any value of @xmath21 and @xmath89 .",
    "the energy scale for arriving at the asymptotic limit is set by @xmath89 even in the dirty limit .",

    "the dashed black curves are the bcs results for comparison .",
    "the crossing of the horizontal axis at a frequency slightly above the end of the phonon spectrum in the case for pb ( thin red curve ) is due to the inelastic scattering processes and is not seen in the bcs curve .",

    "we have presented new thz data on the optical conductivity of pb and compared them with eliashberg results with an emphasis on phonon - assisted ( holstein ) processes not part of bcs .",

    "the normal state impurity scattering drops out of the optical effective mass leaving only phonon renormalizations which show excellent agreement between theory and experiment .",
