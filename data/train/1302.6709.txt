    "the question of whether a given smooth manifold admits a riemannian metric with positive sectional curvature is nearly as old as the subject of riemannian geometry itself .",
    "the classical gauss  bonnet theorem @xmath0 relating the sectional curvature @xmath1 of a compact surface @xmath2 to its euler characteristic , @xmath3 , can be considered a first classification theorem of that kind : the only compact @xmath4manifold of positive curvature is the @xmath4sphere or the real projective plane .",
    "moreover it poses one of the motivational questions for this article : to which degree does positive curvature determine the euler characteristic ? we shall approach an answer to this under mild symmetry assumptions .    given the historic dimension of the topic , it is somewhat surprising that there exists few known examples of smooth manifolds admitting such metrics .",
    "in fact , besides the rank one symmetric spaces @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , there are no known simply connected manifolds in dimensions above 24 that admit metrics with positive sectional curvature .",
    "see ziller @xcite for a survey of known examples and @xcite for recent examples in dimension seven .",
    "the complementary task of proving that certain manifolds do not admit a positively curved metric has proven just as difficult . indeed , for simply connected manifolds that admit a nonnegatively curved metric , there is not a single example that is known not to admit positive sectional curvature . the famous conjecture of hopf that @xmath9 does not admit a positively curved metric , and the fact that it remains open , illustrates how little is known about this question .",
    "the only known obstructions to simply connected manifolds admitting positive sectional curvature are already obstructions for weaker curvature properties .",
    "for example , due to lichnerowicz ",
    "hitchin , a non - vanishing @xmath10genus ( respectively @xmath11invariant ) obstructs the existence of a metric of positive scalar curvature given on a compact spin manifold .",
    "note that a metric of nonnegative scalar curvature can be deformed to a metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "another example is the _",
    "gromov betti number bound _",
    "stating that a compact manifold @xmath12 that admits a nonnegatively curved metric satisfies @xmath13 for all coefficient fields @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant depending only on @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , this implies an upper bound , albeit a large one , for the euler characteristic of @xmath2 .    a conjecture corresponding nicely to this bound is due to bott .",
    "it states that a compact @xmath16manifold admitting ( almost ) nonnegative sectional curvature is ( rationally ) elliptic .",
    "a consequence of this would be that the betti numbers are bounded by those of the @xmath16torus , that is , the conjecture would imply that the gromov constant @xmath15 could be taken to be @xmath17 , as conjectured by gromov . for simply connected @xmath16manifolds , the bott conjecture would imply @xmath18 , as is the case for a product of two - dimensional spheres .",
    "another crucial conjecture in the field is the conjecture by hopf claiming that the euler characteristic of a positively curved manifold of even dimension is positive .",
    "however , general confirmations of all of these conjectures remain elusive .",
    "fortunately , a research program initiated by karsten grove in the 1990s has been breathing new life into these problems for two decades .",
    "the idea is to restrict one s attention to positively curved metrics that admit large isometry groups .",
    "one important notion of  large \" might be that the isometry group acts transitively or with codimension one principal orbits ( see verdiani @xcite and grove  wilking ",
    "ziller @xcite ) , or simply that the dimension of the isometry group is large ( see wilking @xcite ) .",
    "for an application to the hopf conjecture , see pttmann and searle @xcite .",
    "the measure of symmetry we will consider in this paper is the symmetry rank , which is the rank of the isometry group .",
    "many topological classification results of varying strengths ( diffeomorphism , homeomorphism , homotopy etc . ) have been proven under the assumption that the symmetry rank is sufficiently large .",
    "see grove @xcite or wilking @xcite for surveys , as well as theorems [ thm : grovesearle ] and [ thm : wilking03 ] for prototypical examples of such results .",

    "we would like to remark that the upper bound in theorem [ logassumption ] is less than @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) , which is asymptotically less than @xmath27 .",
    "hence even a confirmation of the bott conjecture would not imply the theorem .",
    "this result is consistent with the belief that a stronger upper bound for @xmath3 or @xmath28 holds for positively curved manifolds .",

    "we obtain either @xmath658 or @xmath659 in the respective cases .",
    "these inequalities imply either @xmath660 or @xmath661 the first is a contradiction for @xmath662 , while the second implies @xmath663 for @xmath664 , another contradiction .",
    "* note that if there exists a nonnegatively curved metric on @xmath2 , also the product metric is nonnegatively curved .",
    "no similar result on the existence of nonnegatively curved metrics on connected sums seems to be known unless it is the sum of two rank one symmetric spaces ( see @xcite ) .",
