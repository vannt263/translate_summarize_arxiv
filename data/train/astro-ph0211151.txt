    "in this paper we describe a new dynamical instability in superfluids .",
    "this `` two - stream '' instability is analogous to the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "its key distinguishing feature is that the two fluids are interpenetrating rather than in contact across an interface as in the standard scenario .",
    "the two - stream instability is well known in plasma physics [ where it is sometimes referred to as the `` farley - buneman '' instability @xcite ] , and it has also been discussed in various astrophysical contexts like merging galaxies @xcite and pulsar magnetopheres @xcite , but as far as we are aware it has not been previously considered for superfluids . in fact , the `` standard '' kelvin - helmholtz instability was only recently discussed in the context of superfluids @xcite .    the similarity of the equations used in plasma physics [ a nice pedagogical description of the plasma two - stream instability can be found in @xcite ] to the ones for two - fluid superfluid models inspired us to ask whether an analogous instability could be relevant for superfluids .",
    "that this ought to be the case seemed inevitable . to prove the veracity of this expectation , we have adapted the arguments from the plasma problem to the superfluid case , and discuss various aspects of the two - stream instability in this paper .    of particular interest to us",
    "is the possibility that the two - stream instability may operate in rotating superfluid neutron stars .",
    "mature neutron stars are expected to be sufficiently cold ( eg . below @xmath0  k ) that their interiors contain several superfluid / superconducting components .",
    "such loosely coupled components are usually invoked to explain the enigmatic pulsar glitches , sudden spin - up events where the observed spin rate jumps by as much as one part in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for glitches @xcite have been discussed ever since the first vela pulsar glitch was observed in 1969 @xcite , but these event are still not well understood .",
    "after three decades of theoretical effort it is generally accepted that the glitches arise because a superfluid component can rotate at a rate different from that of the bulk of the star , and that a transfer of angular momentum from the superfluid to the crust of the star could lead to the observed phenomenon .",
    "the relaxation following the glitch is well explained in terms of vortex creep [ see for example @xcite ] , but the mechanism that triggers the glitch event remains elusive . in this context , it seems plausible that the superfluid two - stream instability may turn out to be relevant .",
    "we take as our starting point the two - fluid equations that have been used to discuss the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars @xcite .",
    "hence , we consider superfluid neutrons ( index @xmath2 ) coexisting with a conglomerate of charged components ( index @xmath3 ) .",
    "the constituents of the latter ( mainly ions and electrons in the neutron star crust and protons and electrons in the core ) are expected to be coupled by viscosity and the magnetic field on a very short timescale .",
    "hence , we assume that these charged components will move together and that it is appropriate to treat them as a single fluid .",
    "the corresponding equations are @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 represent the respective number densities and @xmath6 are the two velocities . here , and in the following , we use the constituent index @xmath7 which can be either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the respective mass densities are obviously given by and we further introduce the relative velocity @xmath8 between the two fluids as @xmath9 the first law of thermodynamics is defined by the differential of the energy density or `` equation of state '' , , namely @xmath10 which defines the chemical potentials @xmath11 and the `` entrainment '' function @xmath12 as the thermodynamic conjugates to the densities and the relative velocity . with these definitions",
    "we can write the two euler - type equations : @xmath13 where we have introduced the dimensionless entrainment parameters @xmath14 the equation for the gravitational potential @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 these equations make manifest the so - called entrainment effect .",
    "the entrainment arises because the bare neutrons ( or protons ) are `` dressed '' by a polarization cloud of nucleons comprised of both neutrons and protons .",
    "since both types of nucleon contribute to the cloud the momentum of the neutrons , say , is modified so that it is a linear combination of the neutron and proton particle number density currents ( the same is true for the proton momentum ) .",
    "this means that when one of the fluids begins to flow it will , through entrainment , induce a momentum in the other .",
    "because of entrainment a portion of the protons ( and electrons ) will be pulled along with the superfluid neutrons that surround the vortices by means of which the superfluid mimics bulk rotation .",
    "this motion leads to magnetic fields being attached to the vortices , and dissipative scattering of electrons off of these magnetic fields .",
    "this `` mutual friction '' is expected to provide one of the main dissipative mechanisms in superfluid neutron star cores @xcite .    in order to establish the existence of the superfluid two - stream instability we consider the following model problem : let the unperturbed configuration be such that the `` protons '' remain at rest , while the neutrons flow with a constant velocity @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the coupling through entrainment , i.e. we take @xmath20 , and we also neglect perturbations in the gravitational potential . under these assumptions ,",
    "the two fluids are only coupled `` chemically '' through the equation of state .",
    "writing the two velocities as @xmath21\\hat{x}$ ] and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are taken to be suitably small , we get the perturbation equations @xmath25 and @xmath26 next , we assume harmonic dependence on both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. we use the fourier decomposition @xmath29 $ ] etcetera .",
    "this leads to the four equations @xmath30    we thus have four equations relating the six unknown variables @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to close the system we need to provide an equation of state . given an energy functional @xmath34 we have @xmath35 and similarly @xmath36 finally , we define the two sound speeds by , cf .",

    "this happens when an inflexion point of @xmath53 coincides with @xmath54 .",
    "this is a useful criterion for searching for the marginally stable modes of our system .    as a `` proof of principle '' we consider the particular case of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( we will motivate this particular choice in section  iie ) .",

    "in contrast , the plasma two - stream instability can operate at arbitrarily slow flows .",
    "an ideal plasma is unstable to sufficiently long wavelengths for any given @xmath19 . in reality , however , one must also account for dissipative mechanisms . in the case of real plasmas",
    "one finds that the so - called landau damping stabilizes the longest wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus the two - stream instability sets in below a critical wavelength in more realistic plasma models , and there is typically ( just like in the present case ) a range of flows for which the instability is present .",
    "we will discuss the effects of dissipation on the superfluid two - stream instability briefly in section  iv .",
    "it is useful to consider whether we can derive a necessary condition for the two - stream instability.to approach this problem in full generality would likely be quite complicated , but we can make good progress for the simple one - dimensional toy problem discussed above .",
    "we begin by multiplying the euler equation ( [ eul_n ] ) for the neutrons by the complex conjugate @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to ( after also using the continuity equations to replace the perturbed number densities ) @xmath69 similarly , we obtain from the second euler equation ( [ eul_p ] ) @xmath70 next we combine these two equations to get @xmath71 where we have introduced the pattern speed @xmath72 . from this expression",
    "we see that the imaginary part of the left - hand side must vanish , so we should have i m  @xmath73 .",
    "allowing the pattern speed to be complex , i.e. using @xmath74 we find that the following condition must be satisfied @xmath75 | \\delta v_\\n|^2 + \\left [ 2 - { v_0    \\over \\sigma_r } \\left ( 1 + { c_\\p^2 \\over |\\pat|^2 } \\right)\\right ]      mode , @xmath76 , the frequency clearly must be such that the factors multiplying the absolute values of the two velocities have different signs .",

    "we also require @xmath85 or @xmath86 , the condition that must be satisfied is ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "it is useful to notice two things about this criterion .",

    "a quantity of key importance for this discussion is the rotational lag between the two components . in order to be able to argue that the two - stream instability is relevant for pulsar glitches we need to consider lags that may actually occur in astrophysical neutron stars . to estimate the size of the rotational lag required to `` explain '' the observed glitches we assume that a glitch corresponds to a transfer of angular momentum from a partially decoupled superfluid component ( index @xmath2 ) to the bulk of the star ( index @xmath3 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath187 where @xmath188 are the two moments of inertia .",
    "now assume that the decoupled component corresponds 1% of the total moment of inertia , eg .",
    "the superfluid neutrons in the inner crust or a corresponding amount of fluid in the core .",
    "this would mean that @xmath189 , and we have @xmath190 combine this with the observations of large vela glitches to get @xmath191 in other words , we must have @xmath192 if we assume that the glitch brings the two fluids back into co - rotation , then we have @xmath193 and we see that the two rotation rates will maximally differ by one part in @xmath194 or so .",
    "rotational lags of this order of magnitude have often been discussed in the context of glitches . even though the key quantity in models invoking catastrophic vortex unpinning in the inner crust  the pinning strength",
    " is very uncertain , and there have been suggestions that the pinning force is too weak to allow a build up of the required rotational lag @xcite , typical values considered are consistent with our rough estimate .",
    "in addition , frictional heating due to a difference in the rotation rates of the bulk of a neutron star and a superfluid component has been discussed as a possible explanation for the fact that old isolated pulsars seem to be somewhat hotter than expected from standard cooling models @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that a lag of @xmath195 could explain the observational data . finally , the presence of rotational lags of the proposed magnitude is supported by a statistical analysis of 48 glitches in 18 pulsars @xcite .",
    "this study suggests that the critical rotational lag at which a glitch occurs is @xmath196    in order to make our shell model problem more realistic we consider the case when the superfluid neutrons lag behind the superconducting protons , and take @xmath197 , or @xmath198 , as a representative value . with this rotational lag ,",
    "we see from ( [ yrange ] ) that the unstable modes must be such that @xmath199 .",
    "a series of results for this choice of parameters are shown in figures  [ rotdomain]-[imag25 ] .",
    "figure  [ rotdomain ] illustrates the fact that , if we decrease the rotational lag then the two - stream instability will not be active ( in the interesting region of parameter space ) for low values of @xmath200 . for a smaller rotational",
    "lag the instability acts on a shorter length scale .",
    "for @xmath198 we find that we must have @xmath201 in order for there to be a region of instability in the part of the @xmath173 plane shown in figure  [ rotdomain ] .",
    "this means that the instability only operates on length scales shorter than @xmath202  m ( if we take the shell radius to be @xmath203  km ) .     or @xmath198 .",
    "we show results for four different values of @xmath200 .",
    "there are no unstable modes in this part of parameter space unless @xmath201 .",
    "recall that @xmath204 and @xmath176 would be reasonable parameter values for a neutron star core .",
    "the grey diagonal line represents the singularity discussed in section  iiid and the dashed curves indicate the instability regions in the large @xmath200 limit.,height=302 ]    figure  [ freq25 ] shows the real part of the mode frequencies for @xmath205 and various values of @xmath147 . from this figure",
    "we can see that the instability always occur in the region suggested by the instability condition ( [ yrange ] ) , i.e. two real frequency modes never merge to give rise to a complex conjugate pair of solutions outside the grey areas indicated in the various panels of figure  [ freq25 ] .",
    "the imaginary parts for @xmath205 and the various values of @xmath147 considered in figure  [ freq25 ] are shown in figure  [ imag25 ] . from this figure",
    "we see that the imaginary part of @xmath170 typically reaches values of order @xmath206 .",
    "in fact , by comparing similar results for different values of @xmath200 we have found that the largest attainable imaginary part of @xmath170 varies by less than one order of magnitude as @xmath200 increases from 100 to 1000 .",
    "thus we estimate that the typical instability growth time for @xmath207 will be @xmath208 for a star rotating at the rate of the vela pulsar , @xmath209  ms , we would have @xmath210  s for @xmath211 .",
    "interestingly , this predicted growth time is significantly shorter than the resolved rise time of a large vela glitch @xmath212  s @xcite .    ) as function of the entrainment parameter @xmath175 for @xmath205 , @xmath207 and various values of @xmath147 .",

    "essentially , these results represent horizontal cuts through the frames in figure  [ rotdomain ] .",
    ", height=226 ]      the results obtained above indicate that the two - stream instability is likely to act on modes with rather short wavelengths .",
    "given this it makes sense to consider the large @xmath200 limit in more detail . keeping only the leading order term ( proportional to @xmath213 ) in ( [ disper ] ) we have the dispersion relation @xmath214\\kappa \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( 1 - 2\\eps - x_\\p)\\y + \\eps x_\\p + \\eps(1-x_\\p)\\y^2 - 2x_\\p\\eps^2(1-\\y)^2 = 0 \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can readily write down the solutions to this quadratic : @xmath215^{1/2 } \\right\\ } \\ .",
    "\\label{kappas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it turns out that we can learn a lot about the problem from this expression .",
    "the most obvious feature is the fact that @xmath216 have a singularity when @xmath217 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that one of the roots will become infinite at this point , while the second root becomes : @xmath218 \\ .\\ ] ] for the examples shown in figure  [ rotdomain ] this special case corresponds to the intersection between the instability domain and the diagonal line @xmath217 , as indicated in figure  [ rotdomain ] .",
    "it is also straightforward to deduce the regions of instability from the sign of the argument of the square - root .",
    "we see that we will have an unstable mode when @xmath219 or @xmath220 these regions are also indicated in figure  [ rotdomain ] . out of these two possible instability regions ,",
    "the first is most likely to be relevant for neutron stars since it allows the instability to be present already for small proton fractions .",
    "finally , we can use ( [ kappas ] ) to show the existence of an extremum at @xmath221 the corresponding imaginary part of @xmath170 would represent the fastest possible growth time for an unstable mode located in region  1 of figure  [ rotdomain ] .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath222 or an estimate of the shortest growth time : @xmath223 which agrees well with the result we previously obtained for @xmath211 .",
    "hence , this simple formula can be used to estimate the fastest growth rate of the two - stream instability in our shell model for different parameter values .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the superfluid two - stream instability : a dynamical instability analogous to that known to operate in plasmas @xcite , which sets in once the relative flow between the two components of the system reaches a critical level .",
    "we have studied this instability for two different model problems .",
    "first we analysed a local dispersion relation derived for the case of a background such that one fluid was at rest while the other had a constant flow rate .",
    "this provided a proof of principle of the existence of the two - stream instability for superfluids .",
    "our analysis was based on the two - fluid equations that have been used to model the dynamics of the outer core of a neutron star , where superfluid neutrons are expected to coexist with superconducting protons and relativistic electrons .",
    "these equations are analogous to the landau model for superfluid helium  he . ] , and should also ( after some modifications to incorporate elasticity and possible vortex pinning ) be relevant for the conditions in the inner crust of a mature neutron star . thus we expect the two - stream instability to be generic in dynamical superfluids , possibly limiting the relative flow rates of any multi - fluid system .",
    "our second model problem concerned two fluids confined within an infinitesimally thin spherical shell .",
    "the aim of this model was to assess whether the two - stream instability may be relevant ( perhaps as trigger mechanism ) for pulsar glitches .",
    "the results for this problem demonstrated that the entrainment effect could provide a sufficiently strong coupling for the instability to set in at a relative flow small enough to be astrophysically plausible .",
    "incidentally , the modes that become dynamically unstable in this problem are the superfluid analogues of the inertial r - modes of a rotating single fluid star .",
    "this is interesting since the r - modes are known to be secularly unstable due to the emission of gravitational radiation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the connection between the two instabilities goes even deeper than this since the radiation - driven secular instability is also a variation of the kelvin - helmholtz instability . in that case , the two fluids are the stellar fluid and the radiation .",
    "in order for an instability to be relevant the unstable mode must grow faster than all dissipation timescales . in the case of a superfluid neutron star core",
    "the main dissipation mechanisms are likely to be mutual friction and `` standard '' shear viscosity due to electron - electron scattering . since we have tried to build a plausible case for the two - stream instability to be relevant for pulsar glitches we would like to obtain some rough estimates of the associated dissipation timescales .",
    "to do this we first use an estimate of when mutual friction is likely to dominate the shear viscosity [ due to @xcite ] : @xmath224 where we assume that the wavelength of the mode is @xmath225 .",
    "we can write this as @xmath226 which suggests that the shear viscosity will be the dominant dissipation mechanism for large values of @xmath200 .",
    "for example , for a neutron star rotating with the period of the vela pulsar mutual friction would dominate for @xmath227 or so ( assuming @xmath228 ) . to estimate the shear viscosity damping we can use results obtained for the secular r - mode instability . in particular ,",
    "@xcite have shown that for a uniform density star one has @xmath229 if we use the shear viscosity coefficient for electron - electron scattering @xmath230 we get @xmath231    we want to compare this damping timescale to the growth rate of the unstable modes in our shell toy - model . combining ( [ growth ] ) with ( [ tsv ] )",
    "we estimate that in order to have an instability we must have @xmath232 let us now consider the case of the vela pulsar . estimating the core temperature as @xmath233  k [ roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the observed surface temperature @xcite ] we deduce that only modes with @xmath234 or so are likely to be stabilized by shear viscosity . given that our results indicate that the two - stream instability is active for much smaller values of @xmath200 , cf .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ rotdomain ] , we conclude the dissipation is unlikely to suppress the instability in sufficiently young neutron stars",
    ". incidentally , the length scale corresponding to a mode with @xmath235 would be about ten meters .",
    "this is an interesting result since one can show that a large glitch could be explained by a small fraction ( @xmath236 ) of the neutron vortices moving a few tens of metres @xcite .",
    "obviously , the situation changes as the star cools further .",
    "based on the above estimates one can show that shear viscosity will suppress all modes with @xmath201 ( i.e. all unstable modes for the case considered in fig .",
    "[ rotdomain ] ) if the core temperature is below @xmath237  k. this means that the two - stream instability may not be able to overcome the viscous damping in a sufficiently cold neutron star , which is consistent with the absence of glitches in mature pulsars .",
    "we believe that the results of this paper suggest that the superfluid two - stream instability may be relevant in the context of pulsar glitches . if this is , indeed , the case then what is its exact role ?",
    "the answer to this question obviously requires much further work , but it is nevertheless interesting to speculate about some possibilities .",
    "most standard models for glitches are based on the idea of catastrophic vortex unpinning in the inner crust @xcite .",
    "this is an attractive idea since the glitch relaxation ( on a timescale of days to months ) would seem to be well described by vortex creep models @xcite .",
    "an interesting scenario is provided by the thermally induced glitch model discussed by @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the deposit of @xmath238  erg of heat would be sufficient to induce a vela type glitch .",
    "the mechanism that leads to the unpinning of vortices , eg . by the deposit of heat in the crust",
    ", is however not identified .",
    "we believe that the two - stream instability may fill this gap in the current theory .",
    "it should , of course , be pointed out that glitches need not originate in the inner crust .",
    "in particular , @xcite has argued that the vortex pinning is too weak to explain the recurrent vela glitches .",
    "if this argument is correct then the glitches must be due to some mechanism operating in the core fluid . since the model problems we have considered would be relevant for the conditions expected to prevail in the outer core of a mature neutron star ,",
    "our results show that the two - stream instability may serve as a trigger for glitches originating there .",
    "the key requirement for the instability to operate is the presence of a rotational lag .",
    "it is worth pointing out that such a lag will build up both when there is a strong coupling between the two fluids ( i.e. when the vortices are pinned ) and when this coupling is weak .",
    "one would generally expect the strength of this coupling to vary considerably at various depths in the star @xcite , and it is not yet clear to what extent a rotational lag can build up in various regions .",
    "this is , of course , a key issue for future theoretical work on pulsar glitches .    one final relevant point concerns the recent observation of a vela size glitch in the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1rxs j170849.0 - 400910 @xcite .",
    "this object has a spin period of 11  s , which means that any feasible glitch model must not rely on the star being rapidly rotating .",
    "what does this mean for our proposal that the two - stream instability may induce a glitch ?",
    "let us assume that the rotational lag builds up at the same rate as the electromagnetic spindown of the main part of the star ( i.e. that the superfluid component does not change its spin rate at all under normal circumstances ) .",
    "then the lag would be @xmath239 after time @xmath27 . if there is a critical value at which a glitch will happen ( corresponding to @xmath240 ) then the interglitch time @xmath241 could be approximated by @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the standard `` pulsar age '' .",
    "this argument implies the following : i ) for @xmath244 we would get @xmath245 .",
    "this ( roughly ) means that only pulsars younger than @xmath194  yr would be seen to glitch during 30 years of observation , which accords well with the fact that only young pulsars are active in this sense .",
    "ii ) there is no restriction on the rotation rate in this scenario ; a star spinning slowly may well exhibit a glitch as long as its spindown rate is fast enough .",
    "this means that one should not be surprised to find glitches in stars with extreme magnetic fields ( magnetars ) .",
    "this paper is only a first probe into what promises to be a rich problem area .",
    "future studies must address issues concerning the effects of different dissipation mechanisms , the nonlinear evolution of the instability , possible experimental verification for superfluid helium etcetera .",
    "these are all very interesting problems which we hope to investigate in the near future .",
