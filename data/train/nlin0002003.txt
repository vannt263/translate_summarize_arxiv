    "the four - dimensional self - dual yang - mills equations have several important applications in physics and mathematics @xcite .",
    "for example , many lower dimensional integrable systems can be obtained as reductions of the self - dual yang - mills system , which represents a method to classify integrable systems and to apply twistor techniques to study them .",
    "research in this direction was initiated by ward @xcite , the subsequent investigations are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest for us is the relationship between the self - dual yang - mills system and integrable hierarchies of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional soliton equations .",
    "it has been shown by mason and collaborators that the nonlinear schrdinger and the korteweg - de vries equations @xcite as well as the @xmath1-kdv hierarchies @xcite are reductions of the self - dual yang - mills system .",
    "the generalized akns hierarchies @xcite and the modified kdv systems of drinfeld - sokolov @xcite have been connected to the self - dual yang - mills system in @xcite , and super - extensions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the set of hierarchies related to the self - dual yang - mills system is larger than those mentioned above , and should include many of the generalized drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies introduced in @xcite . to show that this is indeed the case , in this letter we exhibit a family of mappings from the solutions of a large class of integrable hierarchies to those of the self - dual yang - mills equations .",
    "we shall be concerned with self - dual yang - mills fields on @xmath2 equipped with a pseudo - euclidean metric of signature ( 2,2 ) .",
    "the coordinates on this space are denoted by @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the flat metric @xmath5 is given as @xmath6.\\ ] ] a yang - mills field is represented by a connection @xmath7 where @xmath8 varies in some lie algebra @xmath9 . by using @xmath10 $ ] and the usual levi - civita tensor for which @xmath11 , the self - duality equations are defined by @xmath12 where the indices are raised by the inverse metric @xmath13 .",
    "explicitly , they read as @xmath14 equivalently , self - duality can be characterized by the requirement that the operators @xmath15 satisfy @xmath16=0 \\label{i.6}\\ ] ] at any value of the spectral parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we shall see below that commuting operators of the form @xmath18 , @xmath19 above naturally arise from a class of integrable hierarchies which contains , besides the akns and drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies associated with the untwisted affine lie algebras , many other special cases of the systems introduced in @xcite .",
    "we next review the basics of the construction of a general class of integrable hierarchies . for a more detailed description ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "then we shall specialize the input data of the construction in such a way that the solutions of the hierarchy give rise to solutions of the self - dual yang - mills equation .",
    "the input data of the subsequent construction is a triplet @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an infinite dimensional lie algebra , @xmath22 is a derivation that defines a @xmath23-gradation of @xmath21 , and @xmath24 is a semisimple element of @xmath21 which is homogeneous of degree @xmath25 in the gradation @xmath22 . in more detail ,",
    "the gradation is given by the eigenspaces @xmath26 of the derivation @xmath27 , @xmath28 one can restrict the sum to the spectrum of @xmath22 consisting of the grades for which @xmath29 , and we suppose that @xmath30 . as a consequence of @xmath31=[dx , y ] + [ x , dy]$ ]",
    ", one has @xmath32\\subset \\a^{m+n}$ ] .",
    "the semisimplicity of @xmath33 means that it yields a linear direct sum decomposition as @xmath34 where @xmath35=0\\ } , \\quad \\im= \\ { x\\in \\a \\,\\vert\\ , x=[\\lambda , y ]",
    "\\ \\hbox{for}\\ y\\in \\a \\}. \\label{d.4}\\ ] ] the assumption that @xmath36 ensures that @xmath37 is a graded lie subalgebra of @xmath21 and @xmath38 is a graded vector space .",
    "given the above data , one can define an infinite set of commuting evolutional vector fields on the ` phase space ' @xmath39 here @xmath40 and analogous notations will be used without further explanation .",
    "the dynamical variables are the infinitely many independent component fields of @xmath41 , which are smooth ( real or complex valued depending on whether @xmath21 is a real or a complex lie algebra ) functions of the one - dimensional ` space variable ' @xmath42 .",
    "the evolutional vector fields are associated with the non - negatively graded part @xmath43 of the centre of @xmath37 : @xmath44= 0   \\quad \\forall x\\in \\ker\\,\\}\\cap \\a^{\\geq 0}.\\ ] ] concretely , for any @xmath45 one obtains a vector field @xmath46 on @xmath47 as follows .",
    "first , for any @xmath48 one considers the drinfeld - sokolov dressing transformation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are supposed to be formal series @xmath52 it is well - known @xcite that there exists a unique solution @xmath53 , @xmath54 of ( [ d.8 ] ) for any @xmath55 , and the components of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are finite polynomials in the components of @xmath41 and their @xmath42-derivatives .",
    "we here use @xmath58 , \\label{d.11}\\ ] ] or , equivalently , @xmath59 may be thought of as @xmath60 .",
    "the vector field @xmath46 is defined by its action on the ` coordinate ' @xmath61 on @xmath47 as follows : @xmath62 , \\label{vc}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 according to the gradation @xmath22 . since @xmath65 = - [ b(c , j)^{<0},l]$ ]",
    ", @xmath46 is a well - defined vector field on @xmath47 , that is , @xmath66 . since @xmath43 is an abelian lie algebra , the vector fields @xmath46 commute among themselves , @xmath67 ( j(x ) ) = 0   \\qquad \\forall c ,",
    "c'\\in \\h_{\\lambda}^{+}. \\label{vcommute}\\ ] ] if we introduce a time variable @xmath68 for every basis element @xmath69 , and denote the collection of these variables by @xmath70 , then we can write the evolution equations defined by the @xmath46 , @xmath71 , \\label{tceq}\\ ] ] in the zero curvature form @xmath72=0 \\qquad\\hbox{with}\\qquad   l=\\pa_x + j(x,\\t ) + \\lambda , \\qquad { \\cal l}_c = { \\pa \\over \\partial t^c } - b(c , j(x,\\t))^{\\geq 0}. \\label{lcl}\\ ] ] as a result of the compatibility ( [ vcommute ] ) of these evolution equations , one then also has @xmath73=0 \\qquad \\forall c , c'\\in \\h_{\\lambda}^{+}.\\ ] ]    after this preparation , we now show that under certain choices of the data the above zero curvature equations imply the self - duality equations described in the introduction .",
    "since we wish to obtain commuting operators of the form in ( [ i.5 ] ) , we take @xmath21 to be a loop algebra , @xmath74 where @xmath9 is a finite dimensional lie algebra . we assume that the gradation @xmath22 of @xmath21 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an ad - diagonalizable element of @xmath9 with integer eigenvalues whose absolute values are _ strictly less _ than @xmath77 .",
    "thus we have a corresponding gradation of @xmath9 , @xmath78 as before , @xmath33 is a semisimple element of @xmath22-grade @xmath25 . under these assumptions , we can introduce a basis @xmath79 of @xmath43 given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a basis of @xmath82 .",
    "we shall denote the time variables @xmath68 and the lax operators @xmath83 corresponding to these base elements respectively as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the general construction now implies that @xmath86 and it follows from our assumption on the gradation of @xmath9 in ( [ gradg ] ) that @xmath87 expands as @xmath88 by using these expansions , the lax operators defining the hierarchy can be written as @xmath89 in particular , these operators contain only non - negative powers of @xmath17 , due to our assumption on the eigenvalues of @xmath90 in ( [ gradg ] ) .",
    "we then notice that the operators @xmath91 have _ the same form as the lax operators of the self - dual yang - mills equations in _ ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 ( resp .",
    "@xmath94 ) is the part of @xmath95 defined by the decomposition @xmath96 associated with ( [ gradg ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to introduce ` cyclic coordinates ' @xmath97 , on which nothing depends , since by using them we may write @xmath98 which formally follows the same pattern as the other @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath100 .",
    "let us now choose pairs of indices @xmath101 and @xmath102 in such a way that the set @xmath103 consists of 4 different coordinates .",
    "the main point of this paper is the observation that _ any solution @xmath104 of the above constructed integrable hierarchy gives rise to self - dual yang - mills fields by the mapping _ @xmath105 to obtain self - dual yang - mills fields by this correspondence , it is enough that the evolution equations of the hierarchy be satisfied for the finite subset of the variables given by @xmath42 and the @xmath106 s that occur in ( [ ty ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath104 satisfies the hierarchy in all ( or many ) time variables , then it gives rise to ( infinitely ) many self - dual yang - mills fields , too , since the identification of the @xmath3 s in terms of the @xmath106 s is then possible in several different ways .",
    "note that if @xmath107 is taken as one of the lax operators , then the corresponding yang - mills fields are invariant under the translations of the cyclic coordinate @xmath108 , and thus the component @xmath109 associated with this coordinate in ( [ pa0 ] ) can be regarded as a ` higgs field ' in the adjoint representation of @xmath9 . in these cases",
    "the self - duality equation ( [ i.6 ] ) becomes an analogue of the bogomolny equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the self - dual yang - mills fields that appear in the above are special since they vary in the subalgebras @xmath110 and @xmath111 of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a multiple of the homogeneous gradation , @xmath112 , then @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and in this case another special feature is that the yang - mills potentials that multiply @xmath17 in @xmath99 vanish .",
    "the yang - mills potentials that arise from ( [ ppprime ] ) are differential polynomials in the infinitely many components of the field @xmath115 contained in the basic lax operator @xmath55 of the hierarchy . after reducing the degrees of freedom to finitely many fields , in certain cases @xmath61 itself can be regarded as a @xmath9-valued yang - mills potential .",
    "these reductions are discussed briefly in the next section .",
    "it is not difficult to check that the vector fields @xmath46 ( [ vc ] ) are always tangential to the submanifold @xmath116 defined by @xmath117 the restriction of the evolution equations ( [ tceq ] ) to this phase space , where @xmath61 has only finitely many components , is called a modified kdv type hierarchy @xcite . among the modified kdv type hierarchies that can be mapped to the self - dual yang - mills system , let us now concentrate on those for which the condition @xmath118 holds besides eqs .",
    "( [ loopalg ] ) , ( [ gradd ] ) , ( [ gradg ] ) .",
    "then , introducing also another cyclic coordinate @xmath119 , we can represent the basic lax operator @xmath55 as @xmath120 since we have the decompositions @xmath121 and @xmath122 with some @xmath123 . notice that this operator now has the same form as those in ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "therefore it follows from ( [ lcl ] ) that we obtain self - dual yang - mills fields from the solutions of the hierarchy on @xmath124 not only by the correspondence in ( [ ppprime ] ) , but also via the mapping @xmath125 whereby @xmath126 and @xmath127 become components of the yang - mills potential .",
    "more precisely , @xmath128 can be regarded as a higgs field since nothing depends on the associated space - time coordinate @xmath129 .",
    "examples of this kind are the generalized akns systems for which @xmath130 with @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "the mapping of the solutions of the hierarchy to self - dual connections has in this case been described previously in @xcite .",
    "another set of examples is furnished by the generalized modified kdv systems of drinfeld - sokolov @xcite associated with the untwisted affine lie algebras . for these systems",
    "@xmath22 is the so called principal gradation and @xmath24 has grade @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the dual coxeter number of a simple lie algebra @xmath9 .",
    "a different class of reductions of the systems on @xmath47 are the kdv type hierarchies @xcite .",
    "their construction uses , in addition to @xmath21 in ( [ loopalg ] ) , @xmath22 in ( [ gradd ] ) and @xmath135 of @xmath22-grade @xmath25 , an auxiliary integral gradation of @xmath21 .",
    "let this be provided by the eigenvalues of the derivation @xmath136 the two gradations are compatible , @xmath137=0 $ ] , and must satisfy @xmath138 furthermore , one assumes that @xmath139 is a non - trivial subalgebra of @xmath21 for which @xmath140 for our purpose , we also require that @xmath141 , which means that the @xmath142-grades in @xmath9 are strictly smaller than @xmath143 ( analogously to the property of @xmath22 in ( [ gradg ] ) ) . as a consequence , we have @xmath144 , where @xmath9 is naturally embedded in @xmath21 as the set of @xmath17-independent elements .    to associate a kdv type hierarchy with the data @xmath145 , one first restricts the hierarchy on @xmath47 to the submanifold @xmath146 the above conditions guarantee that the restriction is consistent .",
    "that is the vector fields @xmath46 ( [ vc ] ) , still defined by means of the @xmath22-gradation , are in our case tangential to @xmath147 .",
    "the next step is to consider the transformations @xmath148 explicitly , @xmath149 these transformations define an action of the group @xmath150 on @xmath147 , and one sees from ( [ nondeg ] ) that this is a free action , i.e. , only the unit element of @xmath151 has fixed points . then @xmath151 is regarded as a group of _ gauge transformations _ for the hierarchy on @xmath147 , which is possible because the vector field @xmath46 ( [ vc ] ) has a well - defined projection on the factor space @xmath152 .",
    "this follows from the relations @xmath153 which are consequences of the definition of @xmath154 ( [ bcj ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ ddcond ] ) , ( [ nondeg ] ) . by definition ,",
    "the kdv type hierarchy is the hierarchy on @xmath155 modulo the gauge group @xmath151 .",
    "as this is known to hold in special cases @xcite , it is natural to ask whether ` kdv gauge equivalence ' always implies gauge equivalence of the corresponding self - dual yang - mills fields . to answer this question ,",
    "consider a time dependent gauge transformation of a solution of the hierarchy on @xmath147 . the solution represented by @xmath156 is sent to @xmath157 , where we apply ( [ lgamma ] ) with a function @xmath158 .",
    "the definition of the hierarchy implies that @xmath159 will be another solution if and only if @xmath160 solves the following evolution equations : @xmath161 by using ( [ equiv ] ) and ( [ vcommute ] ) , one can check that ( [ gammat ] ) yields well - defined , compatible evolution equations on @xmath160 . in conclusion , the solutions of the hierarchy on @xmath147 which are gauge equivalent to @xmath162 have the form @xmath163 where @xmath160 solves ( [ gammat ] ) for some initial value @xmath164 at @xmath165 .",
    "one easily sees from this that the lax operators @xmath83 defined in ( [ lcl ] ) behave in the following manner with respect to the gauge transformations of the solutions : @xmath166 this formula permits us to show that the self - dual yang - mills fields corresponding , either and @xmath167 , the mapping ( [ pl ] ) can be used if @xmath168 is valid for the kdv type system .",
    "] by ( [ ppprime ] ) or by ( [ pl ] ) , to gauge equivalent solutions of the hierarchy on @xmath147 _ are always gauge equivalent in the usual yang - mills sense_. the equivalence of two @xmath9-valued yang - mills connections @xmath169 and @xmath170 requires the existence of a function @xmath171 in the group generated by @xmath9 for which @xmath172 . in the self - dual case , this amounts to @xmath173 and to @xmath174 for the operators in ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
    "now it is obvious from ( [ kdvgauge ] ) and ( [ pal ] ) , ( [ pa0 ] ) that if @xmath169 belongs to @xmath104 and @xmath170 to @xmath159 then they are gauge related by @xmath175 , where the arguments of @xmath160 different from the @xmath3 are fixed arbitrarily . as mentioned above , @xmath144 , and",
    "thus the proof is complete .",
    "the conditions used in the above are satisfied , for example , for the generalized kdv hierarchies associated with the regular conjugacy classes of the weyl groups of the simple lie algebras @xcite .",
    "these are special cases of the systems introduced in @xcite , and contain the untwisted drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies , which belong to the coxeter conjugacy class .",
    "most of them can be described alternatively as constrained ( matrix ) kp hierarchies .",
    "as one of the simplest examples , let us mention the much studied constrained kp hierarchies that have scalar lax operators of the form @xmath176 for some @xmath177 .",
    "these systems are associated with @xmath178 and the elements of the corresponding conjugacy class of the weyl group @xmath179 decompose as the product of a @xmath1-cycle and a @xmath180-cycle . for detailed description , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it would be interesting to further explore the nature of the relationship between these hierarchies and the self - dual yang - mills equations .",
    "for instance , following the spirit of @xcite , it should be possible to view at least some of them as reductions of a self - dual yang - mills hierarchy , and to apply twistor techniques to describe their @xmath181-functions .",
    "finally , we wish to remark that there exist certain constrained modified kp ( also called non - standard @xmath1-kdv ) hierarchies that fit into an extended version of the drinfeld - sokolov approach for which our above assumptions do not hold @xcite .",
    "these systems , and also the drinfeld - sokolov hierarchies based on the twisted affine lie algebras , can not be mapped to the self - dual yang - mills system by the method presented here .",
    "in fact , in these cases the analogues of @xmath182 in ( [ pal ] ) would contain both positive and negative , or higher than first powers of the spectral parameter , which do not appear in ( [ i.5 ] ) .",
