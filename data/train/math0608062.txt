    "if @xmath2 is a measurable transformation of a lebesgue measure space @xmath3 to itself , that does not preserve the measure @xmath4 , one can study the invariant measures of @xmath2 and compare them to @xmath4 .",
    "a especially interesting case is when @xmath2 is non - singular with respect to @xmath4 ( in the sense that @xmath5 iff @xmath6 ) , but nevertheless there exist no @xmath1-finite invariant measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "such maps @xmath2 are called of _ type iii _ ( with respect to the measure ) .",
    "their existence was conjectured by halmos  @xcite and established by ornstein  @xcite .",

    "recall that @xmath9 expanding maps have absolutely continuous invariant probability measures , so the regularity of the example of bruin and hawkins is essentially sharp .",
    "the question of whether the absence of aci@xmath1 is actually a generic ( in the usual topological sense ) phenomenon for @xmath0 expanding maps of the circle seems to have been first posed by quas  @xcite .",
    "later investigations  @xcite indicated that the known methods failed to decide the question either way .",
    "it was also known that @xmath0-generic maps do behave `` pathologically '' in some respects ( they have no absolutely continuous invariant _",
    "measure  @xcite ) , but not in others ( they are ergodic and conservative with respect to lebesgue measure  @xcite , and they possess a unique physical measure  @xcite ) .    in this paper we show that the type iii property is indeed @xmath0-generic for expanding maps of the circle .",
    "we also mention that the non - existence of _ finite _ invariant measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to riemannian measure was shown to be a generic property among ( expanding or not ) @xmath0 maps of compact manifolds of any dimension ",
