    "the description of the spectrum of surface fluctuations of a liquid from the macroscopic scale down to the molecular scale remains a challenging experimental and theoretical problem . using grazing incidence light scattering experiments , daillant and coworkers",
    "@xcite were able , for the first time , to determine the full spectrum of surface fluctuations , where in previous experiments ( ellipsometry , reflectivity ) only certain aspects of the spectrum could be determined .",
    "at the same time , the spectrum can now be analyzed in computer simulations with ever increasing accuracy @xcite .",
    "theoretical insight into the structure of a simple liquid surface is provided by density functional theories on the one hand @xcite and the capillary wave model on the other hand @xcite .",
    "density functional theories provide a description of the interface on a microscopic level .",
    "the prototype of such theories , the van der waals squared - gradient model , was very successful in describing , for the first term , the density profile and surface tension in terms of molecular parameters @xcite .",
    "it , however , fails to capture the subtle role of long wavelength interfacial fluctuations described by the capillary wave model @xcite .",
    "the capillary wave model introduced in 1965 @xcite describes the spectrum of fluctuations in terms of a height function @xmath4 with the surface tension @xmath5 and gravity @xmath6 acting as the dominant restoring forces .",
    "the length scale involved in describing capillary waves is the capillary length , @xmath7 , which may be as large as a tenth of a millimeter .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to incorporate both theories and to describe the spectrum of fluctuations of a liquid surface , as determined from light scattering experiments and computer simulations , from the molecular scale to the scale of capillary waves .",
    "an important ingredient in `` bridging the gap '' between capillary waves and the molecular scale is an extension of the capillary wave model that incorporates the energy associated with _ bending _ the interface @xcite .",
    "bending is important when the wavelength of the height fluctuations is approximately @xmath8 , which is typically of the order of a few times the molecular diameter , i.e. close to the scale where the molecular structure becomes important and the density fluctuations are more bulk - like .",
    "the natural question that arises is whether it is possible to describe the full spectrum of surface fluctuations by the capillary wave model at long wavelengths and bulk - like fluctuations at the molecular scale .",
    "is it then necessary to include the leading order correction to the capillary wave model from bending or are even higher order terms , relevant at even smaller length scales , required ?",
    "this article addresses these questions in two parts ( a condensed version has appeared in ref .  ) . in the first part",
    ", we analyze the spectrum of fluctuations recently obtained by vink _",
    "@xcite in computer simulations of a phase - separated polymer - colloid system @xcite in which the interactions are strictly short - ranged .",
    "it is shown that the simulation data are very accurately described by the combination of the capillary wave model extended to include a bending correction , with the bending rigidity as an adjustable parameter , and bulk - like fluctuations .    in the second part , a molecular basis for the bending correction to the capillary wave model",
    "is offered and the results are compared with the simulations . the theoretical framework used for the comparison is mean - field density functional theory in which the interactions are described by a non - local , integral term @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it features the full shape of the interaction potential enabling the analysis of different forms and ranges of the interaction potential .",
    "we consider both short - ranged interactions , and long - ranged interactions , that fall of as @xmath9 at large intermolecular separations .",
    "an important ingredient in our theoretical analysis is the modification of the density profile , described by @xmath10 , due to the local _ bending _ of the interface @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath10 requires one to formulate precisely the thermodynamic conditions used to vary the interfacial curvature .",
    "several approaches for the determination of @xmath10 have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "they differ in the form of the external field used to set the curvature to a specific value ; in the equilibrium approach @xcite the external field is uniform throughout the system , whereas in the approach by parry and boulter @xcite it is infinitely sharp - peaked ( @xmath11 ) at the interface . in this article",
    "we suggest to add an external field acting in the interfacial region only with a peak - width of the order of the thickness of the interfacial region .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the bulk regions are unaffected by the additional of the external field and the resulting @xmath10 is a continuous function .    our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the general form of the surface structure factor to describe the spectrum of interfacial fluctuations is derived as the combination of the capillary wave model extended to include a bending correction and bulk - like fluctuations .",

    "the mean - field density functional theory used to provide a molecular basis for the bending extension to the capillary wave model is presented .",

    "in the classical capillary wave model ( cw ) , the fluctuating interface is described by a two - dimensional surface height function @xmath4 , where @xmath12 is the direction parallel to the surface @xcite .",
    "the fluctuating density profile can then be written in terms of an `` intrinsic density profile '' shifted over a distance @xmath4 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic density profile .",
    "often , fluctuations are assumed to be small so that an expansion in @xmath15 can be made , neglecting terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 an important consequence of the above linearization is that one may now identify the intrinsic density profile as the _ average _ density profile , @xmath18 , in view of the fact that @xmath19 .",

    "we found that a fit to the simulation results yields @xmath307 , i.e. the leading order curvature correction tends to _ lower _ the surface tension @xmath53 .",

    "we propose to describe @xmath87 for large @xmath63 ( @xmath308 ) in terms of molecular , bulk - like fluctuations through @xmath110 .",

    "the bending rigidity is the dominant contribution near @xmath309 and one necessarily requires a positive value for @xmath57 @xcite , but for the simple , ( quasi ) one - component system considered here this is not an issue .",
    "a most important and generally underappreciated point that we like to emphasize is that the location of the interface can not be defined _",
    "unambiguously_. a certain procedure must always be formulated to determine the height function @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that different choices for the location of the interface , which are all equally legitimate as long as they lead to a location of the dividing surface that is ` sensibly coincident ' with the interfacial region @xcite , lead to different results for the bending correction to the capillary wave model .",
    "naturally , all _ experimentally _ measurable quantities _ can not _",
    "depend on the chosen location of the interface , making it necessary to formulate precisely the quantity that is determined in experiments or simulations .",
    "it was shown that for the simulation results , the value of the bending rigidity in the above expression for @xmath87 , corresponds to the height function being defined according to the integral constraint , @xmath310 .",
    "for the determination of @xmath57 , it is necessary to take the contribution from bulk - like fluctuations into account since they also contribute as a constant , @xmath143 , in the capillary wave regime ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "this observation is consistent with the interpretation of light scattering results by daillant and coworkers @xcite . to determine @xmath53",
    ", they subtract from @xmath87 a contribution proportional to the penetration depth ( @xmath312 ) times the liquid compressibility ( @xmath313 ) .",
    "even though the light scattering results by daillant @xcite are obtained for real fluids , for which the interaction potential is not necessarily short - ranged , one expects that a description in terms of the above mentioned three regimes is again useful .",
    "a further comparison with the light scattering results is , however , necessary .    in the second part of this article , a molecular theory to describe the inclusion of the bending rigidity correction to the capillary wave model",
    "is presented .",
    "an essential feature of the theory is the ` ansatz ' made in eq.([eq : v_ext ] ) regarding the thermodynamic conditions used to vary the interfacial curvature .",
    "it improves on earlier choices made in the sense that the bulk densities are equal to those at coexistence and the density profile is a continuous function @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts that the scaling behavior of the bending rigidity equals that of the surface tension near the critical point @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the usual surface tension critical exponent ( in mean - field @xmath316 ) @xcite .",
    "this new scaling prediction differs fundamentally from the scaling of the bending rigidity in the ` equilibrium approach ' , @xmath317 . in this approach the bending rigidity",
    "is determined from considering the equilibrium free energy of spherically and cylindrically shaped liquid droplets , with their radii varied by changing the value of the system s chemical potential @xcite .    the negative sign and scaling behavior of the bending rigidity obtained from the molecular theory are in accord with monte carlo simulations . however , the magnitude of @xmath57 from the molecular theory , @xmath248  0.13  @xmath3 , is significantly below the value obtained in the simulations , @xmath248  0.47  @xmath3 ( see also figure [ fig : k_sr2 ] ) , but we believe this to be due to simplifications made in the theory rather than a true discrepancy .    * acknowledgment * i am indebted to dick bedeaux for arguing with me on this intriguing topic since already 20 years .",
