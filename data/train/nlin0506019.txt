    "spatially discretized partial differential equations ( or , equivalently , chains of coupled ordinary differential equations ) have attracted considerable attention recently .",
    "one of the issues that has been vigorously debated and that will concern us in this paper , is whether discrete systems can support solitary waves travelling without losing energy to resonant radiation and decelerating as a result .",
    "we address this issue for one of the prototype models of nonlinear physics , the @xmath0-theory : @xmath1 the @xmath0-equation ( [ continuous - phi4 ] ) is lorentz - invariant , and so the existence of the travelling kink @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is an immediate consequence of the existence of the stationary kink for @xmath5 . on the other hand , if we discretize equation ( [ continuous - phi4 ] ) in @xmath6 , @xmath7 the translation and lorentz invariances are lost , and the existence of the travelling kink ( and even of an arbitrarily centred stationary one ) becomes a nontrivial matter . in equation ( [ phi-4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the lattice spacing , and the nonlinearity @xmath12 satisfies the continuity condition @xmath13 we restrict ourselves to symmetric discretizations , i.e. @xmath14 equation ( [ continuous - phi4 ] ) results from ( [ phi-4 ] ) in the continuum limit , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this limit ,",
    "the truncation error of the taylor series is @xmath18 .",
    "we shall be concerned with monotonic kink solutions of ( [ phi-4 ] ) : @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "as @xmath17 , such monotonic discrete kinks approach the continuous kink ( [ travelling ] ) .",
    "the most common , one - site discretization of the nonlinearity function is given by @xmath21 it is a well established fact @xcite , however , that the discrete klein - gordon equation ( [ phi-4])+([nonlinearity - phi4 ] ) admits only a countable set of stationary monotonic kinks with the boundary conditions @xmath22 physically , this fact is related to the presence of the peierls - nabarro barrier , an effective potential periodic with the spacing of the lattice .",
    "half of the stationary kinks are centred at the minima ( the on - site kinks ) and the other half ( the off - site kinks ) at the maxima of the peierls - nabarro potential .",
    "there are no continuous families of stationary discrete kinks of the form @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a free parameter , which would interpolate between the two solutions . in an abuse of terminology",
    ", we will be calling such families `` translationally invariant kinks ''  although , in the first place , translation invariance is a property of an equation rather than a solution , and in the second , all lattice equations are of course _ not _ translationally invariant . as for propagating waves , of special importance are kinks moving at constant speed and without the emission of radiation .",
    "we will be referring to such kinks , i.e. solutions of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a monotonically growing function satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bcs ] ) , as _ sliding kinks _ , to emphasise the fact that they do not experience any radiative friction .",
    "being an obstacle to the  translationally invariant \" kinks , the peierls - nabarro barrier is also detrimental to the existence of sliding kinks  at least for small @xmath27 ( see reviews in @xcite and @xcite ) .    in an attempt to find a discrete model with  translationally invariant \" and sliding kinks , speight and ward @xcite considered a hamiltonian discretization of the form @xmath28 in the static limit , the corresponding energy admits a topological lower bound which is saturated by a first- ( rather than second- ) order difference equation .",
    "this equation is readily shown to have a one - parameter continuous family of stationary kink solutions @xmath23 for @xmath29 ( see proposition 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 of the family defines the position of the kink relative to the lattice .",
    "since all members of the family have the same ( lowest attainable ) energy , the stationary kink experiences no peierls - nabarro barrier . as for travelling kinks , speight and ward s numerical simulations revealed that although moving kinks in this model do lose energy to cherenkov radiation and decelerate as a result , this happens at a slower rate than a similar process in equation ( [ nonlinearity - phi4 ] ) ( see figures 4 and 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "another line of attack was chosen by bender and tovbis @xcite who proposed a different discretization supporting a continuous family of arbitrarily centred stationary kinks : @xmath30 in this case , the family arises due to the suppression of the stationary kink s resonant radiation .",
    "in fact , the family of stationary kinks can be found explicitly as @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "( the solution ( [ al - kink ] ) coincides with the stationary dark soliton of the repulsive ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite . )    finally , the nonlinearity @xmath34 was introduced by kevrekidis @xcite , who demonstrated the existence of a two - point invariant and hence a first - order difference equation associated with the stationary equation .",
    "consequently , the discretization ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) also supports a continuous family of stationary kinks for all @xmath35 $ ] with some @xmath36 .",
    "( for general discussion , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "a relevant property of the model ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) , which is related to the existence of a two - point invariant @xcite and indicates some additional underlying symmetry , is the conservation of momentum .",
    "( see also @xcite . )    since the reasons for the nonexistence of `` translationally invariant '' kinks and of sliding kinks are apparently related ( the breaking of symmetries of the underlying continuum theory or , speaking physically , the presence of the peierls - nabarro barrier ) , the availability of  translation - invariant \" stationary kinks in the models ( [ nonlinearity - speight ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - tovbis ] ) and ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) suggests that they might have sliding kinks as well .",
    "it is the purpose of the present study to find out whether this is indeed the case .",
    "we shall analyse the persistence of continuous families of stationary kinks @xmath23 for nonzero velocities ; in other words , examine the existence of solutions of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a monotonically growing function satisfying ( [ bcs ] ) , and @xmath39 .",
    "we develop an accurate numerical test in the limit @xmath17 which shows whether or not standing and travelling kinks of the discrete @xmath0 model ( [ phi-4 ] ) bifurcate from the exact kink solutions ( [ travelling ] ) of its continuous counterpart ( [ continuous - phi4 ] ) .",
    "the analysis of this bifurcation poses a singular problem in perturbation theory which can be analysed using two ( inner and outer ) matched asymptotic scales on the complex plane @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nonvanishing of the stokes constant in the inner asymptotic equation serves as a sufficient condition for the non - existence of continuous solutions of the difference equations @xcite .",
    "our test will be based on computing the stokes constant for the differential - difference equation underlying the lattice system .",
    "we will examine all four discretizations of the @xmath0 theory mentioned above , i.e. equations ( [ nonlinearity - phi4 ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - speight ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - tovbis ] ) and ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) .",
    "since translationally invariant stationary kinks @xmath40 do exist for the three exceptional nonlinearities ( [ nonlinearity - speight ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - tovbis ] ) and ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) , the stokes constant is _ a priori _ vanishing for @xmath5 in these three cases .",
    "however , we will show that in all three cases the stokes constant acquires a nonzero value as soon as @xmath27 deviates from zero .",
    "it remains nonzero for all @xmath27 except a few isolated values which define the particular velocities of the sliding kinks in the corresponding model .",
    "there is one such isolated zero of the stokes constant for the nonlinearity ( [ nonlinearity - speight ] ) and three _ sliding velocites _ for the discretization ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) .",
    "consequently , the main conclusion of this work is that the sliding kinks , i.e. kinks travelling at a constant speed without the emission of radiation , can occur only at particular values of the velocity .",
    "the sliding velocities are , of course , functions of the discretization spacing @xmath11 , so that sliding kinks arise along continuous curves on the @xmath41-plane .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a remark on a convention adopted in the remainder of this paper  namely , that the linear part of the function @xmath12 in ( [ phi-4 ] ) can always be fixed to @xmath42 without loss of generality . indeed",
    ", the most general function satisfying ( [ nonlinearity - continuous ] ) and ( [ nonlinearity - symmetry ] ) is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is arbitrary .",
    "since @xmath45 in ( [ phi-4 ] ) is also a free parameter , we can always make a replacement @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "this gives @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 which is independent of the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section ( section [ section2 ] )",
    "we review the construction of the outer and inner asymptotic solutions in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "section [ section3 ] contains details of the numerical computation of the stokes constants while the last section ( section [ section4 ] ) summarises the results of our work .",
    "we are looking for a sliding - kink solution of the discrete @xmath0 models ( [ phi-4 ] ) in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is assumed to be a twice differentiable function of @xmath53 , that satisfies the differential advance - delay equation @xmath54 with the boundary conditions @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "the velocity @xmath27 is assumed to be smaller than 1 in modulus . if a solution to this boundary - value problem ( i.e. a heteroclinic orbit ) exists , then the parameter @xmath24 is arbitrary due to the translation invariance of the advance - delay equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath11 ( which stands for the lattice step - size ) can be used to reduce equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) to a singularly perturbed differential equation as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "formal asymptotic solutions of the problem ( [ advance - delay ] ) can be constructed at the inner and outer asymptotic scales .",
    "the formal series represent convergent asymptotic solutions of the singular perturbation problem only if the stokes constants are all zero @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis beyond all orders of perturbation theory was pioneered by kruskal and segur @xcite and has been utilised by many authors .",
    "it was extended by pomeau et .",
    "@xcite to allow the computation of radiation coefficients from borel summation of series rather than from the numerical solution of differential equations .",
    "essentially the same method has been applied to different problems by grimshaw and joshi @xcite and tovbis and collaborators @xcite . in this paper , we shall work with formal inner and outer asymptotic series for the problem ( [ advance - delay ] ) without attempting rigorous analysis of their asymptoticity .",
    "assuming that the solution @xmath52 is a real analytic function of @xmath57 , we consider the taylor series for the second difference in a strip @xmath58 since the cubic polynomial @xmath59 satisfies the continuity and symmetry relations ( [ nonlinearity - continuous ] ) and ( [ nonlinearity - symmetry ] ) , the nonlinearity of ( [ advance - delay ] ) can also be expanded in a taylor series in the same strip : @xmath60 where the coefficients @xmath61 depend on even derivatives and even powers of odd derivatives of @xmath52 , and also @xmath62 .",
    "the differential advance - delay equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) can thus be written as @xmath63 for @xmath64 , equation ( [ singular - perturbation ] ) becomes the travelling wave reduction of the continuous model ( [ continuous - phi4 ] ) , with the explicit solution @xmath65    we will search for solutions of equation ( [ singular - perturbation ] ) of the form @xmath66 substituting the expansion ( [ perturbation - series ] ) into ( [ singular - perturbation ] ) we get , at order @xmath67 , @xmath68 where the linearised operator @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 are polynomials in @xmath72 and their derivatives .",

    "it is not difficult to prove by induction that if @xmath75 are all odd in @xmath57 for @xmath76 , the nonhomogeneous term @xmath71 is also odd in @xmath57 and hence , by the fredholm alternative , there exists a unique odd bounded solution @xmath77 for @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath71 decays to zero exponentially fast as @xmath78 , the function @xmath77 is also exponentially decaying for any @xmath79 . the perturbation @xmath80 in particular satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation @xmath81 where the numerical coefficients depend on whether the nonlinearity function @xmath82 is given by ( [ nonlinearity - phi4 ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - speight ] ) , ( [ nonlinearity - tovbis ] ) or ( [ nonlinearity - panos ] ) : @xmath83 the odd bounded solution @xmath80 of the nonhomogeneous equation ( [ first - order ] ) is : @xmath84 where @xmath85 the hat in the series ( [ perturbation - series ] ) indicates that the series is formal , i.e.  it may or may not converge @xcite , depending on the choice of @xmath27 and @xmath49 in equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) .",

    "this is illustrated in figure [ pathofintegrationfig ] .",
    "there are two contributions to the difference @xmath227 .",

    "the second contribution ( manifest only in the @xmath161 case ) arises because the _ integrand _ increases as the singularity is encircled , since it is a branch point of the logarithm .",
    "since @xmath230 can be written as @xmath231 , where @xmath232 , we see that @xmath122 increases by @xmath233 as the branch point @xmath212 is encircled in the @xmath161 case .",

    "we were able to tune @xmath27 for a fixed value of @xmath11 so that the radiation was reduced to the order of @xmath320 , whereupon the finite accuracy of our numerical scheme prevented any further reduction . to make sure that the radiation does vanish rather than reaching a local minimum but remaining nonzero",
    ", we plot the average magnitude of the radiation near the ends of the interval as a function of @xmath27 , for fixed @xmath11 .",
    "this is defined as the average of @xmath321 ^ 2 $ ] over the last 20 units of the interval , where @xmath322 is the average value of @xmath52 over these last 20 units .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ radiationzero ] .",
    "note the straight - line behavior of the graphs near the isolated values of @xmath27 ; this indicates that the coefficient of the sinusoid superimposed over the kink s flat asymptote crosses through zero ( rather than attaining a small but nonzero minimum ) .",
    "the supression of radiation at the isolated points is thereby verified .",
    "finally , the last question that we would like to address here is whether the intensity of the radiation from the moving discrete kink depends on the type of discretization .",
    "more specifically , we would like to know whether the choice of one of the exceptional discretizations ( which , by definition , support translationally invariant _ stationary _ kinks ) serves to reduce the radiation from the _ moving _ kinks .",
    "speight and ward have already given an affirmative answer for their exceptional discretization ; here we consider the one - parameter nonlinearity @xmath323 which interpolates between the one - site nonlinearity ( [ nonlinearity - phi4 ] ) ( for which @xmath324 ) and the exceptional discretization ( [ nonlinearity - tovbis ] ) of bender and tovbis ( for which @xmath325 ) .",

    "( it nonetheless remains nonzero , of course , unless @xmath165 . )",
    "in this paper we have investigated the existence of sliding kinks  i.e. discrete kinks travelling at a constant velocity over a flat background , without emitting any radiation  in four discrete versions of the quartic - coupling theory .",
    "one of these models is the most common , one - site , discretization . as the overwhelming majority of discrete @xmath0-equations",
    ", it supports travelling kinks , but these kinks do radiate and decelerate as a result .",
    "the other three discretizations we considered are all exceptional in the sense that they all support one - parameter continuous families of stationary kinks where the free parameter defines the position of the kink relative to the lattice .",
    "this property is clearly nongeneric ; the translation invariance of the continuous @xmath0-theory is broken by the discretization and hence in generic disretizations kinks may only be centred at a site or midway between two sites . since the nonexistence of `` translationally - invariant '' and of sliding kinks in the generic models can be ascribed to similar factors , _ viz .",
    "_ , the breaking of the translation and lorentz invariances , it was hoped that the exceptional discretizations might turn out to be equally exceptional from the point of view of sliding kinks .",
    "our approach was based on the computation of the stokes constants associated with the putative sliding kink in a given equation .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that the sliding kinks do exist in the discrete @xmath0 theories , but only with special , isolated , velocities ( which of course depend on @xmath11 ) .",
    "there is one such velocity in the exceptional model of speight and ward , and three different sliding velocities in the discretization of kevrekidis .",
    "it is natural to expect that the sliding kinks should play the role of attractors similarly to the fronts moving with `` stable velocities '' in dissipative systems ; that is , radiating travelling kinks should evolve into kinks travelling with the sliding velocities  if there are such velocities in the system .",
    "not every discretization supports sliding kinks , of course ; in particular , no sliding velocities arise for the generic , one - site , nonlinearity and even for the exceptional discretization of bender and tovbis .    one natural way of trying to construct the sliding kinks is via power series expansions in powers of @xmath328 ; for the exceptional discretizations , this construction can be carried out to any order .",
    "this approach was pursued in the recent work of ablowitz and musslimani @xcite .",
    "our results indicate , however , that these power series will not converge and exponentially small terms ( terms lying beyond all orders of the power expansion ) emerge because of the singular behaviour of the stokes constant @xmath217 as @xmath249 .",
    "detailed studies of this singular limit will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the exceptional discretizations have richer underlying symmetries than generic nonlinearities but the `` translation invariance '' of the stationary kink alone does not automatically guarantee the existence of the sliding velocities . the exact relation between the `` translational invariance '' and mobility of kinks",
    "is still to be clarified ; at this stage it is worth mentioning that the stokes constant associated with ( and hence the intensity of radiation from ) a moving kink is several orders of magnitude smaller in exceptional models than in generic discretizations .    finally , it is instructive to point out some parallels with an earlier work of flach , zolotaryuk and kladko @xcite who also studied the phenomenon of kink sliding in klein - gordon lattices . in the scheme of @xcite ,",
    "one postulates an analytic expression for the sliding kink , @xmath329 , with some explicit function @xmath52 , and then reconstructs the klein - gordon nonlinearity for which this is an exact solution .",
    "our present conclusions are in agreement with the results of these authors who observed that for a given @xmath11 , the kink may only slide at a particular , isolated , velocity .",
    "the two approaches , ours and that of @xcite , are reciprocal ; while we examine the existence of sliding kinks for particular discretizations of the @xmath0-theory , with fixed parameters independent of the kink s velocity , in the `` inverse method '' of @xcite one assumes an explicit solution of a particular form but does not have any control over the resulting nonlinearities .",
    "consequently , the discrete klein - gordon models generated by the `` inverse method '' are not discretizations of the @xmath0-theory and do include explicit dependence on the velocity of the sliding kink .",
