    "@xmath53 is then given in terms of pairs of classical paths which explicitly include the effect of boundary scattering .",
    "however most pairs ( of different paths ) produce oscillating contributions which we assume to vanish after energy or size averaging .",
    "the main contribution to the field sensitive part of @xmath20 arises from diagonal terms ( otherwise known as the cooperon channel ) obtained by pairing paths with their time reverse . assuming that the magnetic field affects the phase of the particles but not their trajectories we can write @xmath54 where @xmath55 \\ ; . \\label{zsc}\\ ] ] here , @xmath56 is the period of the trajectory , @xmath57 is the vector potential , @xmath58 , and the level broadening was introduced via @xmath59 .",

    "however this summation does not include closed pairs of paths which follow periodic orbits of the corresponding clean system .",
    "such paths involve zero momentum transfer between the green functions at the impurity positions ; they actually represent disconnected diagrams which are included in @xmath22 and must not be counted again in the determination of @xmath21 .",
    "it is the presence of these periodic orbits in the determination of @xmath22 that leads to strong sensitivity with respect to the system geometry @xcite ( see below ) .    in the following",
