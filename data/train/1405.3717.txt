    "the classical principle of corresponding states ( pcs ) is widely used to study the thermodynamic properties of matter @xcite . in its general statement the pcs",
    "can be proven explicitly only if the interaction potentials of the systems can be related by simple scaling transformation of the parameters @xcite . for real systems",
    "the interatomic potential is very complicated due to the complex structure of molecules .",
    "moreover , the effective interaction varies with the density and temperature due to excitation of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this situation is typical for liquid metals @xcite . in such cases the refinement of the nave form of the pcs",
    "is needed @xcite . in comparison with the simple molecular fluids the behavior of associative fluids and liquid metals is much more diverse .",
    "these systems are interesting in view of the deviation from the classical formulation of the pcs based on simple scaling of the interaction potential .",
    "in particular , the coexistence curves ( cc ) of alkali metals like @xmath1 has greater asymmetry @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the general properties of the binodal appear to be the same as those of simple fluids .",
    "namely , the binodal shows the same global approximate cubic behavior and obeys the law of rectilinear diameter @xcite ( lrd ) in wide temperature range below @xmath2 : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the number density of the liquid and vapor phases correspondingly , @xmath5 is the critical density .",
    "in addition to the lrd there is one more remarkable phenomenological linearity - the linear character of the unit compressibility factor line : @xmath6 which is called the zeno - line (  zeno  stands for ",
    "@xmath7 equals one  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be derived easily for the van der waals equation of state and in this case known as the batschinski law @xcite .",
    "here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are determined as follows @xcite : @xmath10 clearly @xmath8 is the boyle temperature .    for simple fluids and model systems with pair interactions of the lennard - jones ( lj ) type and even for such associative liquids like ammonia and water zeno - linear law holds fairy well as",
    "the available data show @xcite .",
    "thus linearities eq .   and",
    "eq .   can serve as a basis for the extended formulation of the pcs with thermodynamic similarity classes determined by these linear laws .",
    "the validity of these linearities for broad set of liquid metals and molecular fluids was studied in a series of works of apfelbaum and vorobev @xcite .",
    "in particular in @xcite it was demonstrated that liquid metals also obey extended thermodynamic similarity based on the zeno - line linearity .",
    "the correlation of the zeno - parameters @xmath11 with the critical parameters @xmath12 similar to that in molecular fluids was demonstrated .",
    "using such correlation the position of high - temperature critical points inaccessible via direct measurements can be estimated for metals like @xmath13 etc .",
    "these estimates was based on the results @xcite which state the relation between the critical point parameters and those of the zeno - line @xcite . according to the general idea of similarity , in a sense of apfelbaum&vorobev approach , the ratios @xmath14 , @xmath15 should be universal .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the results of apfelbaum&vorobev can be interpreted as the correspondence between the phase diagram of the fluid and the lattice gas of the form : @xmath16 the key element in constructing transformation eq .",
    "is the linear zeno - element @xmath17 which is associated with the line @xmath18 of the lattice gas model . here",
    "@xmath19 is the lattice gas density , @xmath20 is the dimensionless temperature of the lattice model so that the critical state is given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is @xmath24 and can be related with the scaling property of the attractive potential @xmath25 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dimension @xcite .",
    "the temperature parameter @xmath28 is the boyle temperature in the vdw approximation @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the effective diameter of the particle hard core .",
    "the density parameter @xmath33 is determined by the following relation : @xmath34 the zeno - element parameters @xmath33 and @xmath28 are different from @xmath35 because linear zeno - element do not coincide with the zeno - line .",
    "only in case of vdw eos they become equal .",
    "e.g. for the lj potential @xmath36 in 3d : @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "further we will use the dimensionless variables @xmath39 . basing on such simple geometrical scheme the estimates for the cp loci of the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluids",
    "were obtained in different dimensions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mapping gives 1 - 1 correspondence between liquid - gas states of a fluid and the lattice gas model , so the critical point @xmath40 of the lattice gas transforms to the cp of the lj fluid : @xmath41 e.g. for 3d case eq .",
    "leads to the estimates : @xmath42 which correlate quite good ( the difference less than 5% ) with known numerical results @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the approach on which eq .",
    "is based does not include the critical fluctuations .",
    "it is mean - field like in physical sense as it does not use the renormgroup symmetry of the critical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that using eq .",
    "it is possible to obtain the relation between the critical compressibility factors @xmath0 of the lj - fluid and the lattice gas , or equivalently the ising model @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the result of @xcite obtained for simple fluids to liquid alkali metals and other fluids like water , ammonia and methanol which demonstrate the associative properties in near critical region .",
    "we propose an explanation for the difference between the values of the critical compressibility factor @xmath0 of simple fluids and that of liquid metals , water , ammonia and methanol .",
    "the idea is that it is caused by the difference between the lattice structures of the isomorphic lattice models , namely , the number of particles per unit cell that reflects the associative properties of a fluid .",
    "also we derive the equation for the critical point line of the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluids consistently from the global isomorphism approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the isomorphism transformation and its parameters .",
    "we show that the use of corresponding parameters of the projective mapping unifies the description of cp parameters for simple lj - fluids and liquid metals .",
    "we propose the explanation for the difference in the critical compressibility factor values of simple liquids and associative liquids like liquid metals , water etc .",
    "using global isomorphism approach . in section  [ sec_weakstrict ]",
    "we derive the equation of the line of the critical points for the lj fluids . and give the consistent interpretation of the results in @xcite .",
    "the critical compressibility factor @xmath43 is the basic parameter for the definition of thermodynamic similarity class .",
    "it is invariant with respect to the scaling transformation of the parameters of the interaction .",
    "the substances are commonly classified with respect to this value . as is known for simple fluids @xmath44 and differs substantially from that of the vdw eos @xmath45 .    in @xcite",
    "the relation between critical compressibility factor ( ccf ) of lj - fluid and the isomorphic lattice model ( ilm ) was derived : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the critical temperature of the ising model and @xmath48 is the compressibility factor of the lattice gas model .",
    ".   is applicable at least for the fluids where the thermodynamics is governed mainly by the van der waals dispersive interaction with @xmath49 asymptote , in particular , for the lj fluids ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the formula is obtained from the following relation between the thermodynamic potentials of the lj fluid and the lattice gas : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pressure of a fluid , @xmath52 - its chemical potential , @xmath53 is the gibbs potential of the lattice model , @xmath54 is the field conjugated to the order parameter @xmath19 .",
    "this is direct consequence of eq .",
    "@xcite .    in accordance with @xcite the value @xmath48",
    "is related with the partition function per spin of the critical state @xmath55 of the ising model : @xmath56 e.g. in 3d ising model case of cubic lattice with isotropic interaction : @xmath57 , the critical temperature is @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "if we take into account that the interaction constants of the lj potential @xmath59 and the ising model @xmath60 connected by the relation @xmath61 then eq .   along with eq .   gives : @xmath62 which correlates quite well with the ccf value for simple fluids like noble gases ( see table  [ tab_zc_simple ] ) .",
    ".experimental values of @xmath0 for simple fluids @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the comparison of theoretical estimates eq",
    ".   for @xmath0 shows good correlation with the data ( see table  [ tab_zc_cmplx ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that for light liquid metals with high temperature cp there is uncertainty in value @xmath0 because direct measurements are not possible .",
    "the extrapolation methods for the low temperature data are used to obtain the parameters of the critical state .",
    "for example , for lithium @xmath63 , for sodium @xmath64 according to @xcite . commonly , such extrapolation exploits the linear diameter law ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fluctuational region the classical , mean - field behavior of the diameter breaks down and non analytical terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the binodal for alkali metals is bigger than that of molecular fluids and it appears that the amplitudes of such non analytical terms are also big in comparison with those of molecular fluids @xcite .",
    "the symmetrization of the binodal with the nonlinear fluctuational terms like @xmath68 and @xmath69 should be distinguished from the regular nonlinearity and needs different approach ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", such terms can be accounted for within the m.  fisher s theory of complete scaling @xcite ( see also @xcite and reference therein ) . for high temperature metals like @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 such procedure has been performed recently in @xcite .",
    "the results assume that for @xmath72 @xmath73 , which corresponds to the alkali metal value .",
    "the value of ccf for @xmath70 and @xmath71 is @xmath74 and therefore comparable with that of the noble gases . in view of the electronic structure",
    "it could be explained easily .",
    "indeed , the electronic configuration of @xmath72 @xmath75 with unpaired electron qualitatively identical with alkali metals , while electronic structure of @xmath70 and @xmath71 with paired electrons , @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspondingly , make them close to monoatomic molecular fluids .",
    "this is indirect support for choosing the values of @xmath0 for lithium and sodium from @xcite because of similarity of electronic structure for alkali metals .    from the results described obtained above we can conclude that water , ammonia and alkali liquid metals fall into the same class of the ilm with @xmath78 which reflects their dimerization near the critical point .",
    "methanol is known for the abundance of the tetramers in saturated vapor @xcite and identified with @xmath79 .",
    "thus the conclusion is that low values of @xmath80 for the associative lj fluids can be attributed to the association in near critical region .",
    "this provides the alternative to the empirical correction factors like the pitzer s and the riedel s parameters at least for the fluids which demonstrate the association in near critical region .",
    "additionally we can suggest that @xmath72 is dimerized in near critical region while @xmath70 and @xmath71 remain monoatomic .",
    "this is the difference between monovalent and divalent metals @xcite .",
    "simple form of the transformation is due to the rectilinear diameter law . in particular",
    ", this means that the cp of a given fluid @xmath81 lies on the binodal diameter - the median of the  liquid - gas triangle  : @xmath82    .,title=\"fig : \" ] +    also interesting empirical relation for the critical points of real fluids was revealed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it states that in reduced coordinates @xmath83 , @xmath84 the critical points of the substances lie along the straight line : @xmath85 which is parallel to the zeno line . within the global isomorphism approach the scaling arguments in favor of the relation were given in @xcite .",
    "here we extend these arguments in view of the results of the previous section .",
    "indeed , using it is easy to obtain : @xmath86 and @xmath87 for 3d lj fluid case @xmath38 and eq",
    ".   leads to eq .  .",
    "the natural question arises how to explain that cps of different fluids belong to these two lines . to explain this we note that does not depend on the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "it is natural because of the isink - like  particle - hole  symmetry of the binodal @xcite .",
    "the global isomorphism approach states that there are two main characteristics of the isomorphic lattice model : the potential and the lattice structure , e.g. elementary cell etc .",
    "in fact there are two ways of  deformation  .",
    "the first one is to change the attractive part of the potential thus changing the parameter @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_zenomedian ] ) and keeping the lattice structure of the ilm fixed . in general this changes the class of the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "another way is to change the lattice structure with the fixed attractive potential .",
    "the class of the critical behavior does not change , only nonuniversal quantities vary .",
    "thus there are two levels of isomorphism : the strong and the weak ones .",
    "the systems are isomorphic in weak sense if their critical behavior falls in the same isomorphism class @xcite . in this sense",
    "the alkali metals , water and other lj fluids are ( weakly ) isomorphic . for the interaction of the lj",
    "the lattice interaction can be taken in the simplest form of the nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "it is natural that critical asymptotics do not depend on the fine details of the lattice structure of the isomorphic lattice model .",
    "the isomorphism in the strong sense assumes the identity of the corresponding lattice models .",
    "thus two lj fluids which differ by the ilm structure are not isomorphic in strong sense and differs by the nonuniversal scale invariant characteristics like the critical value of the compressibility factor @xmath80 , etc .",
    "symmetric @xmath89 diagrams of these fluids can not be compared directly . rather their symmetric ilm binodals should be related via simplest scaling relation with the zeno - line @xmath18 as the invariant element .",
    "the result of section  [ sec_zc ] assumes that the  association ",
    "factor @xmath90 introduced above plays the role of the scaling parameter .",
    "indeed , it is directly related with the scaling of the order parameter @xmath19 of the ilm . correspondingly the temperature variable @xmath91 should be scaled in the proper way too . of course , the binodals of the ising model on different lattices are different , but their scaling properties under the scaling transformations of the basic constants - the lattice spacing and the interaction amplitude @xmath60 should be the same .",
    "the projective character of the transformation allow to find easily such scaling property which is hidden in original fluid @xmath92 diagram .",
    "indeed , the point @xmath93 is the center of dilation which obviously conserves the symmetry of the binodal and represent scaling of the variables @xmath91 and @xmath19 ( see fig .  [ fig_cpshift ] ) .",
    "the line joining the center of dilation with the cp @xmath94 is : @xmath95 and represents the line of the critical points for the lattice models generated by the corresponding scaling transformation .",
    "it is easy to check that by the projective mapping the line transforms into the line of the critical points on @xmath96 plane eq .  .",
    "in case of 3d lj fluid when @xmath38 eq .   perfectly corresponds numerically with the equation of the critical point line obtained in @xcite via empirical analysis of the data .",
    "( see text for the explanation).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    yet from physical point of view eq",
    ".   differs from the original form of apfelbaum and vorobev in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite claimed that the right hand side depends on the critical exponent @xmath97 : @xmath98 but according to the definition the value @xmath99 depends on the locus of the critical point rather than the universal exponents . within the concept of universality and scaling the cp locus",
    "is determined by the fluctuations of all scales while the values of critical exponents are determined by the long range fluctuations and their interactions . in terms of the lattice models",
    "this is obvious that one can change drastically cp locus by varying the lattice properties ( coordination number , symmetry etc . ) without change of the universality class since @xmath97 is the invariant in a weak sense .",
    "the same argument applies to another similarity factor : @xmath100 which according to the results of @xcite for the lj fluids takes the value @xmath101 .",
    "our results in section  [ sec_zc ] allow to get the estimates for @xmath102 easily in terms of our zeno - element parameters : @xmath103 which for simple 3d lj - fluid ( @xmath104 ) gives : @xmath105 this perfectly matches the values obtained in @xcite for simple lj fluids .",
    "so we can conclude that within the global isomorphism approach the invariants @xmath106 and @xmath107 depend on the specific characteristics of the ilm and are invariants in the strong sense .",
    "note that in view of the results @xcite eq .   can be applied not only for 3d but also for 2d lj fluids where @xmath108 and the critical point line is : @xmath109 it would be interesting to check this prediction in experiment .",
    "the main result of the paper is the relation eq .   between critical compressibility factor of the lj fluid and the isomorphic lattice model which takes into account the association of the fluid .",
    "it is based on the relation eq .   with the trivial factor accounting for the association of the fluid .",
    "it supports the idea of global isomorphism relation between the equilibrium thermodynamics of the lj fluid and the corresponding lattice model which restores the  particle - hole  symmetry .",
    "such modification reproduces known values of @xmath0 for simple and complex lj fluids quite good without use of any fitting parameter ( see table  [ tab_zclatt ] ) . from the results we can conclude that low values of @xmath0 signify that big fraction of associates ( dimers , trimers etc ) contributes to the density in near critical region . considering the obtained results we see that apart from the liquid alkali metals mercury falls out from this class .",
    "indeed , mercury is known for strong dependence of the interaction on the thermodynamic state @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath0 for the mercury is much bigger @xmath110 and highly nonlinear dependence of the binodal diameter takes place @xcite . at the same time",
    "mercury binodal is more symmetric in comparison with that of alkali metals .",
    "therefore the general scheme of symmetrization can be applied @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results of @xcite suggest that for mercury the general scheme of the global isomorphism approach can be applied with the specific lattice model different from those of ",
    "simple  liquids . note that in such an approach the fact that all these fluids belong to the ising universality class of the critical behavior @xcite is due the short ranged character of the interaction .",
    "the specific features of the lattice structure affect only non universal quantities like the locus of the critical point , the critical compressibility factor @xmath0 , amplitudes etc .",
    "this opens the way for the prediction of the high temperature critical points of metals like @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 based on new formulation of the thermodynamic similarity laws @xcite .",
    "clearly the arguments presented here are of heuristic nature , yet the whole approach is based on general empirical facts and obvious symmetry properties . the problem of derivation of presented results from the first principles of statistical physics is the natural way for further studies .",
    "the author thank konstantin yun for the support of the research .",
    "the anonymous referee is acknowledged for paying attention to paper @xcite .",
