    "the denomination `` sigma term '' stands , in a generic way , for the contribution of the quark masses @xmath1 to the mass @xmath2 of a hadronic state @xmath3 . according to the feynman - hellmann theorem   @xcite , one has the exact result ( the notation does not explicitly take into account the spin degrees of freedom ) @xmath4 in practice , and in the case of the light quark flavours @xmath5 , one tries to perform a chiral expansion of the matrix element of the scalar density appearing on the right - hand side of this formula . in the case of the pion , for instance ,",
    "one may use soft - pion techniques to obtain the well - known result   @xcite ( here and in what follows , @xmath6 stands for corrections of order @xmath7 modulo powers of @xmath8 ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the single flavour light - quark condensate in the @xmath11 chiral limit , while @xmath12 stands for the corresponding value of the pion decay constant @xmath13 mev .    in the case of the nucleon",
    ", the sigma term is defined in an analogous way , as the value at zero momentum transfer @xmath14 of the scalar form factor of the nucleon ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 and contains , in principle , information on the quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass @xmath18 .",
    "most theoretical evaluations of the nucleon sigma term consider the isospin symmetric limit @xmath19 , but this is not required by the definition ( [ defsig ] ) .    another quantity of particular interest in this context is the relative amount of the nucleon mass contributed by the strange quarks of the sea , @xmath20 large-@xmath21 considerations ( zweig rule ) would lead one to expect that @xmath22 is small , not exceeding @xmath23 .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 can be related , _ via _ the sigma term and the strange to non - strange quark mass ratio , to the nucleon matrix element of the @xmath24 breaking part of the strong hamiltonian , @xmath25 for the standard scenario of a strong @xmath10 condensate , @xmath26 , the evaluation of the product @xmath27 in the chiral expansion gives @xmath28 mev at order @xmath29   @xcite , @xmath30 mev at order @xmath31   @xcite , and @xmath32 mev at order @xmath33   @xcite .",
    "although the nucleon sigma term is a well - defined qcd observable , there is , unfortunately , no direct experimental access to it . a link with the @xmath34 cross section ( for the notation",
    ", we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite ) at the unphysical cheng - dashen point , @xmath35 , is furnished by a very old low - energy theorem   @xcite , @xmath36 a more refined version of this statement   @xcite relates @xmath37 and the form factor @xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the size of the correction @xmath42 , as estimated within the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , is small   @xcite , @xmath43 mev ( an earlier calculation to one - loop in the relativistic approach   @xcite gave @xmath44 mev ) .    in order to obtain information on @xmath45 itself , one",
    "thus needs to pin down the difference @xmath46 , and to perform an extrapolation of the @xmath34 scattering data from the physical region @xmath47 to the cheng - dashen point , using the existing experimental information and dispersion relations .",

    "obtains @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the remainder , which contains the contributions from the higher order terms in the expansion ( [ threxp ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value @xmath53 mev was obtained , so that the determination of @xmath45 boils down to the evaluation of the subthreshold parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "their values can in principle be obtained from experimental data on @xmath34 scattering , using forward dispersion relations   @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 stand for the corresponding forward dispersive integrals , while the subtraction constants are expressed in terms of the @xmath34 coupling constant @xmath59 and of the s- and p - wave scattering lengths as follows : @xmath60 the dispersive integrals @xmath57 and @xmath58 are evaluated using @xmath34 scattering data , which exist only above a certain energy , and their extrapolation to the low - energy region using dispersive methods . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , the two scatering lengths @xmath61 and @xmath62 are kept as free parameters of the extrapolation procedure . in the karlsruhe analysis , their values were obtained from the iterative extrapolation procedure itself   @xcite . using the partial waves of   @xcite , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtain the following simple representation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , in units of @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 this leads then to a value @xmath67 mev , corresponding to @xmath68   @xcite .",
    "further details of this analysis can be found in refs .",
    "in the framework of chiral perturbation theory , the sigma term has an expansion of the form @xmath69 the first two terms of this expansion were computed in the framework of the non - relativistic hbchpt in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath70 the determination of the low - energy constant @xmath71 , which appears also in the chiral expansion of the @xmath34 scattering amplitude , is crucial for the evaluation of @xmath45 .",
    "earlier attempts , which extracted the value of @xmath71 from fits to the @xmath34 amplitude extrapolated to the threshold region using the phase - shifts of refs .",
    "@xcite , obtained rather large values , @xmath72 mev   @xcite ( @xmath73 gev@xmath74 ) , or even @xmath75 mev   @xcite ( @xmath76 gev@xmath74 ) , as compared to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the threshold region in the case of elastic @xmath34 might however correspond to energies which are already too highy in order to make these determinations of @xmath71 stable as far as higher order chiral corrections are concerned .",
    "a new determination of @xmath71 , obtained by matching the @xmath77 hbchpt expansion of the @xmath34 amplitude _ inside the mandelstam triangle _ with the dispersive extrapolation of the data leads to a smaller value   @xcite , @xmath78 gev@xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath79 mev .",
    "it remains however to be checked that higher order corrections do not substancially modify this result .",
    "let us mention in this respect that the higher order contribution @xmath80 ( which contains a non - analytic @xmath81 piece ) in the expansion ( [ sigexp ] ) has been computed in the context of the manifestly lorentz - invariant baryon chiral perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( see also   @xcite ) .",
    "once the expression of the @xmath34 amplitude is also known with the same accuracy   @xcite , a much better control over the chiral perturbation evaluation of @xmath45 should be reached .",
    "finally , let us also mention that the results quoted above were based on the @xmath34 phase - shifts obtained by the karlsruhe group   @xcite .",
    "using instead the sp99 phase - shifts of the vpi / gw group , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtain a very different result , @xmath82 gev@xmath74 , which leads to @xmath83 mev .",
    "needless to say that the consequences of this last result ( @xmath84 ) would be rather difficult to accept .",
    "we next turn to the discussion of several new experimental results which have some bearing on the value of the nucleon sigma term .",
    "all numerical values quoted below use @xmath85 mev and @xmath13 mev .",
    "let us start with the influence of the scattering length @xmath61 on the value of the subthreshold parameter @xmath54 , using eq .",

    "@xcite consists in extracting the combinations of scattering lengths @xmath88 from the value of pion deuteron scattering length @xmath89 obtained from the measurement of the strong interaction width and lifetime of the 1s level of the pionic deuterium atom   @xcite . assuming charge exchange symmetry ( @xmath90 ) , they find @xmath91 ( third line of table 1 ) .",
    "another determination of @xmath61 is also possible using the gmo sum rule ( we use here the form presented in   @xcite , with the value of the total cross section dispersive integral @xmath92 , expressed in mb and @xmath93 , @xmath61 expressed in units of @xmath94 ) @xmath95 using the value @xmath96 obtained by   @xcite and the determination @xmath97 from the uppsala charge exchange @xmath98 scattering data   @xcite , one obtains @xmath99 . the resulting effect on @xmath100",
