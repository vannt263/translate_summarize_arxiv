    "the pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath9 and @xmath0 represent a subject of considerable interest since some time which has been addressed in many investigations ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the physical states of @xmath9 , @xmath0 mesons can be constructed as a superposition of @xmath10 , @xmath11 members of a su(3 ) pseudoscalar nonet with one mixing angle .",
    "if the coupling constants ( defined usually by the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a member of the su(3 ) nonet , and @xmath14 ) follow the same pattern as the state mixing then they must be related to each other as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the state mixing angle",
    ". a combined phenomenological analysis @xcite of data on two - photon decays of @xmath9 and @xmath0 as well as @xmath17 transition form factors shows indeed that one can parameterize the relation among the coupling constants by such a relation , however , with an angle essentially differing from the state mixing angle .",
    "the interrelation between the two angles and different decay constants can be found by considering the divergences of axial vector currents including the @xmath18 axial anomaly , which couples the @xmath0 state with gluon fields @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 axial anomaly plays also a crucial role in understanding the physical masses of the @xmath9 and @xmath0 mesons from the point of view of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "it is known @xcite that the non - zero divergence of the axial current @xmath19 in the chiral limit in presence of interactions is due to couplings with gluons arising after renormalization .",
    "this anomaly is responsible for the generation of the heavy mass of the physical @xmath0 meson .",
    "yet , the anomaly is connected with a violation of the ozi rule for the nucleon and seems also to point to a small strangeness admixture in the proton wave function @xcite .",
    "this also has a direct consequence in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "for instance , the goldberger - treiman relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) relates the nucleon - nucleon-@xmath0 coupling constant @xmath20 ( which is non - zero because of ozi rule violation ) with the flavor - singlet axial constant @xmath21 and to the coupling @xmath22 with gluons .",
    "if the gluon contribution is ignored in this relation then the emc measurements lead to the so - called `` spin crisis '' @xcite .",
    "a knowledge of all terms in the goldberger - treiman would allow to understand the origin of the spin crisis .",
    "however , neither @xmath20 nor @xmath22 have been measured directly in experiments . from this point of view",
    "an investigation of the @xmath1 reactions can be considered a tool for supplying additional information on a wide range of fundamental theoretical issues .",
    "the strong decay channels of @xmath9 and @xmath0 are highly suppressed by various constraints ( such as @xmath23 parity ) so that their widths are extremely narrow implying a relatively long life - time and , consequently , a suitable means to investigate different theoretical aspects of the ozi rule , @xmath18 axial anomaly , role of gluons in the @xmath24 vertex etc .",
    "a further remarkable fact is that near the threshold the invariant mass of the @xmath24 system in corresponding reactions is in the region of heavy nucleon resonances , i.e.resonances with isospin @xmath25 can be investigated via these processes .",
    "furthermore , resonances weakly bound with nucleons ( the so - called `` missing resonances '' @xcite ) can be studied in principle .",
    "first saphir data on @xmath0 photo - production @xcite has shown a strong rise of the cross section near the threshold which indicates a possibly large contribution from nucleon resonance excitation . moreover , if one assumes that the production mechanism is solely governed by resonances then the new states @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be predicted @xcite .",
    "however , further analysis of the saphir and clas @xcite data has shown @xcite that data are also compatible with a larger number of resonances , including higher spin states @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. , data are still too scarce to firmly determine the properties of the relevant resonances .",
    "another aspect of @xmath0 production in elementary hadron reactions is that the subsequent dalitz decay may constitute a prominent source of di - electrons in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "indeed , the recent hades data @xcite exhibit a sizeable di - electron yield at large invariant masses which , besides the contribution from the vector mesons @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , can be due to @xmath32 mesons too .",
    "the @xmath9 dalitz decay has been quantified @xcite as prominent contribution to the invariant mass spectrum , indeed .",
    "one of the primary aims of the hades experiments @xcite is to seek for signal of chiral symmetry restoration in compressed nuclear matter .",
    "for such an endeavor one needs a good control of the background processes , including the @xmath0 dalitz decay , in particular at higher beam energies , as becoming accessible at sis100 within the fair project @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 dalitz decays depend on the pseudo - scalar transition form factor , which encodes hadronic information accessible in first - principle qcd calculations or qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "the dalitz decay process of a pseudo - scalar meson @xmath13 can be presented as @xmath33 obviously , the probability of emitting a virtual photon is governed by the dynamical electromagnetic structure of the `` dressed '' transition vertex @xmath34 which is encoded in the transition form factors @xcite . if the decaying particle were point like , then calculations of @xmath35 mass distributions and decay widths would be straightforward along standard quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) techniques .",
    "deviations of the measured quantities from the qed predictions directly reflect the effects of the form factors and , thus the internal hadron structure , and , consequently , can serve as experimental tests to discriminate the different theoretical models in the non - perturbative qcd regime .",
    "yet , calculations of the transition form factor within perturbative qcd involve triangle and box diagrams , which are tightly connected to the @xmath18 axial anomaly so that form factors provide additional information on the nature of anomalies in quantum field theories , here qcd .    in the present paper",
    "we study the di - electron production from dalitz decay of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath3 and @xmath7 reactions at beam energies of a few gev for kinematical conditions corresponding to the hades setup @xcite .",
    "our focus is to elaborate a model which provides a reliable energy dependence of the total cross section of @xmath0 meson production and its subsequent decay into a di - electron and a photon at threshold - near beam energies . to this end",
    "we calculate the dependence of the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath36 upon the invariant mass of the subsystem @xmath37 around the pole masses of @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the invariant mass distribution of di - electrons in a suitable kinematical range as a function of the di - electron invariant mass and argue that such a quantity , normalized to the real photon point and supplemented by some specific kinematical factor , represents the transition form factor . in such way",
    "the extraction of the transition form factor becomes accessible .",

    "the model is based on direct calculations of the relevant feynman diagrams within a covariant phenomenological meson - nucleon theory .",
    "the model parameters have been fixed from independent experiments and adjusted to achieve a good description of the available experimental data . in the present paper , diagrams with excitation of nucleon resonances with masses close to the masses of a nucleon plus @xmath0 meson",
    "have been also included .",
    "these are @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "the corresponding effective constants , whenever possible , have been obtained from the known decay widths of direct decay into the @xmath0 channel or radiative decay with subsequent use of vector meson dominance conjecture .",
    "also we use effective constants commonly adopted in the literature and obtained from different considerations , e.g. , su(3 ) symmetry , fit of photo - absorbtion reaction etc .  @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "total cross sections and angular distributions for @xmath0 production in @xmath39 reactions are presented .",
    "comparison with available experimental data is also performed . in section iv ,",
    "the @xmath0 dalitz decay is considered .",
    "results of calculations of the invariant mass distribution as a function of the di - electron mass are presented for different initial energies .",
    "the role of the transition form factor in such processes is investigated as well .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath42 the invariant cross section is @xmath43 where the factor @xmath44 accounts for @xmath45 identical particles in the final state , @xmath46 denotes the invariant amplitude squared , @xmath47 is the nucleon mass , @xmath48 denotes the invariant mass of a particle or a sub - system of particles with total four - momentum @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the invariant phase volume . the kinematical factor @xmath52 , describing the incident flux , is defined as @xmath53",
    ". eventually , @xmath54 are the momenta of the final nucleons , leptons and photon , respectively .      the invariant amplitude @xmath55 is evaluated here within a phenomenological meson - nucleon theory based on effective interaction lagrangians ( see @xcite ) which include ( i ) isoscalar mesons : scalar ( @xmath56 ) , pseudo - scalar ( @xmath9 ) , vector ( @xmath31 ) , ( ii ) isovector mesons : scalar ( @xmath57 ) , pseudo - scalar ( @xmath58 ) and vector ( @xmath30 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the nucleon and meson fields , respectively , and bold face letters stand for iso - vectors .",
    "all couplings with off - mass shell particles are dressed by monopole form factors @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the 4-momentum of a virtual particle with mass @xmath64 .    to describe the dalitz decay of the @xmath0 meson eqs .",
    "( [ mnn1])-([mnn ] ) must be supplemented with the corresponding lagrangians describing the interaction of the electromagnetic field @xmath65 with di - electrons ( @xmath66 ) and with the @xmath0 meson , @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "lagrangians ( [ mnn1])-([em ] ) determine the @xmath69 matrix from which one generates the corresponding tree - level feynman diagrams describing the `` bremsstrahlung '' of @xmath0 off nucleons and the subsequent dalitz decay @xmath70 .",
    "usually such diagrams are called in the literature as nucleonic currents in dalitz decay of mesons .",
    "the @xmath0 meson can be produced also by an internal conversion of the exchanged mesons , the so - called conversion or meson current .",
    "the dominant exchange mesons in this case are @xmath31 and @xmath30 mesons with the interaction lagrangians @xmath71 the corresponding diagrams are the same as in @xmath9 production @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .    in the threshold - near kinematics for the @xmath0 production in @xmath39 reactions",
    "there are several firmly determined nucleon resonances ( four stars , according to the particle data group classification @xcite ) and a large number of the so - called `` missing resonances '' @xcite , which , in principle , can be excited in these processes .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 production can serve as additional tool to search for and to investigate the missing resonances in the mass interval @xmath72 . as mentioned in the introduction , in refs .",
    "@xcite a preliminary analysis of saphir data @xcite has been performed assuming that only resonance currents contribute in this kinematical region .",
    "then , excitations of missing @xmath73 and @xmath74 resonances have been considered and their pole masses and widths are estimated .",
    "a further combined analysis  @xcite , including also the clas data @xcite , has demonstrated that excitations of only two resonances are not sufficient to describe the data , and at least two more missing resonances , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , ought to be involved into the calculations . eventually , a systematic analysis of the @xmath0 production in photo and @xmath39 reactions @xcite has shown that an equally well description of data could be achieved with several diverse sets of diagrams , which include different numbers of known and missing resonances .",
    "this means that up to now the available data is too scarce to determine unambiguously the kind and characteristics of resonances contributing in this kinematical region .",
    "moreover , since in photo and @xmath39 reactions one can observe excitations of different resonances , it is not mandatory to analyze simultaneously photo and @xmath39 data within the same set of diagrams .",
    "we are interested in finding reliable parameterizations of the energy dependence of the total cross section and angular distributions near the threshold .",
    "consequently , in order to reduce the number of free parameters and to avoid additional ambiguities , in the present analysis we consider only the known ( four stars ) lowest spin resonances @xmath4 with odd parity , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 with even parity .",
    "the corresponding nucleon - meson - resonance interaction lagrangians can be found in ref .",
    "it should be mentioned that the inclusion of higher spin resonances leads to additional uncertainties .",
    "it is known that the lagrangian for particles with spins @xmath77 possesses an additional symmetry , i.e. , additional free parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein quoted ) .",
    "thus , the invariance of the lagrangian with respect to the point transformation causes an additional transformation parameter @xmath78 and the of - mass shell parameter @xmath79 . in the present calculation",
    "we adopt @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "also , the choice of the form of higher - spin propagators has been a subject of discussion in the literature @xcite with respect to the choice of the spin projector operator @xmath82 ( off mass shell or on mass shell ) and the order to write the product of the energy projection operator @xmath83 with the spin projection operator @xmath82 ( only for on - mass shell particles these two operators commute ) . in the present paper",

    "the choice of the magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath87 is still matter of debate .",
    "the ozi rule would imply a small value of @xmath87 , while the above mentioned @xmath9-@xmath0 mixing conjecture can relate the corresponding coupling constants and express @xmath87 via @xmath88 providing in such a way a relatively large @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "an analysis based on @xmath89 symmetry and @xmath9-@xmath0 mixing angle , as performed in ref .",

    "note that in the analysis @xcite some 50% of the pseudoscalar - pseudovector admixture in the @xmath24 lagrangian has been adopted .",
    "subsequent investigations have shown that such a constant is too large , and a new upper limit @xmath91 has been proposed @xcite for the pseudo - vector coupling . moreover , even values consistent with zero are also admitted in attempts to estimate the couplings and masses of possible excitations of the missing resonances @xcite . evidently , the choice of a small value @xmath87 implies a negligible contribution of the nucleonic currents , therefore increasing the role of meson conversion and nucleon - resonance currents in the @xmath0 production .    in our calculations",

    "@xcite the form factor ( [ ffconv ] ) has been changed from the monopole to dipole form . as a result ,",

    "the mass @xmath107 is replaced by @xmath108 to take into account the finite life time of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "for such factorized feynman diagrams one can separate , in the cross section , the dependence on the variables connected with the dalitz decay vertex and perform the integration analytically @xcite . then",
    ", formally , eq .  ( [ ampl ] ) allows one to write the differential cross section ( [ crossnn ] ) in a factorized form as well , @xmath109 where the integrals over the final di - electron and photon variables have been carried out analytically ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "the decay rate @xmath110 for the @xmath111 meson is defined as @xmath112 the electromagnetic fine - structure constant is denoted as @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the transition @xmath115 form factor .",
    "the cross section for the production of a pseudoscalar meson with @xmath111 quantum numbers but with @xmath116 is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the invariant mass of the two nucleons in the final state , and the two - particle invariant phase - space volume @xmath119 reads @xmath120    it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) that all the peculiarities of the cross section for the full reaction @xmath121 are basically determined by the sub - reaction @xmath122 with creation of a virtual @xmath111 meson . hence , before analyzing the full reaction , we shall proceed with a detailed study of the sub - reaction @xmath122 , i.e. the production of an on - mass - shell @xmath111 meson .",
    "it ought to be mentioned that generally the feynman diagrams deal with asymptotically free particles , i.e. account for reactions with non - interacting particles in initial and final states .",
    "however , in the real process ( [ dalitzpp ] ) the two nucleons can interact in the initial state ( isi ) before the @xmath111 creation , and in the final state ( fsi ) as well , provoking distortions of the initial and final @xmath39 waves .    the initial state distortion due to the @xmath39 interaction before the @xmath111 creation is to be evaluated at relatively high energies , i.e. , larger than the threshold of the @xmath111 meson production , @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the variation with the kinetic energy of isi effects is small . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of isi can be factorized in the total cross section and henceforth it plays a role of a reduction factor in each partial wave in the cross section .",
    "this reduction factor depends on the inelasticity and phase shifts of the partial waves at the considered energies . at the threshold ,",
    "the number of initial partial wave is strongly limited by the partial waves of the final states and , in principle , one can restrict oneself to @xmath126 and @xmath127 waves .",
    "experimentally it is found @xcite that at kinetic energies of the order of few @xmath128 the phase shifts @xmath126 and @xmath127 are indeed almost energy independent and the reduction factor for each partial wave can be taken constant . in our calculations",
    "we adopt , for the reduction factor @xmath129 , the expression from ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to @xmath130 for the @xmath127 wave and @xmath131 for the @xmath126 waves ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "final state interaction effects in the @xmath39 system have been calculated within the jost function formalism @xcite which reproduces the singlet and triplet phase shifts at low energies .",
    "details of calculations of fsi with the jost function can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath134 , besides the above listed meson conversion contribution , includes the nucleonic and resonance currents , each of them being a coherent sum over all the considered exchanged mesons .",
    "the corresponding parameters are described above in section [ subsecii ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in spite of the large number of considered diagrams and the large number of effective parameters , there is not too much freedom in fitting the cross section as long as the known resonances are considered .",
    "however , if one fits data with additional inclusion of missing resonances , a bulk of parameters remain practically free and can be fine - tuned to optimize the description of data .",
    "we performed some investigation of such a model with unknown resonances by considering few missing resonances with masses about @xmath135 and found that , since the energy dependence of the cross section is rather smooth , various sets of parameters fit equally well the data near the threshold .",
    "however , for each of the considered set it turns out that the cross section rises too rapidly at large values of the excess energy .",
    "therefore , to reconcile this dependence with a smoother behavior at large excess energies one can , in principle , add more and more resonances and adjust appropriately the relative ( unknown ) signs of the couplings to compensate contributions from different diagrams ( the interested reader can find a detailed analysis of such a situation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in our present calculations we included only the known four - stars resonances",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "results of numerical calculations for the total cross section @xmath136 are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , for proton - proton and proton - neutron reactions , respectively .",
    "experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    "the total contribution of nucleonic and resonance currents ( dot - dashed lines ) is found to be much smaller than the mesonic diagrams alone providing a constructive interference in @xmath3 and a destructive one in @xmath7 reactions . as already discussed , the small contribution of the nucleonic and resonance currents is due to the smallness of the coupling constants @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the magnitude of other parameters entering in our calculations are dictated by the known experimental data . a reasonable agreement with data",
    "is achieved almost by the contribution of the meson conversion currents .",
    "this does not contradict to the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , if one adopts a dipole form factor @xcite for the meson conversion vertex , then additional resonances with freely adjustable parameters have to be accommodated in the model .",
    "to further investigate the role of different diagrams , one needs to consider quantities being more sensible to the production mechanism .",
    "for instance , a detailed investigation of the angular distribution ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) shows that the mesonic current provides a form of the differential cross section which evolves from a flat to a convex curve with increasing excess energy .",
    "contrarily , the nucleonic and resonance currents give a concave shape of the corresponding contributions .",
    "the interference effects ( which are maximum in forward - backward directions ) lead to a slightly convex form of the resulting curves .",
    "experimental data are still too scarce to determine more precisely the relative contributions of different diagrams . note again that , taking into account more resonances , the description of the experimental data on angular distribution at larger excess energies can not be improved @xcite .",
    "new data will essentially enlighten the problem .",
    "note also that , even achieving a good fit of the cross section in proton - proton reactions , it is not _ a priory _ clear whether the obtained set of parameters equally well describes also the proton - neutron reactions . the isospin dependence of the amplitude is determined by a subtle interplay of different diagrams with different exchange mesons ( scalar , vector , iso - scalar , iso - vector etc . ) .",
    "once the parameters for @xmath3 reactions are fixed , the @xmath7 amplitude follows directly from this set of parameters without any further readjustment . of course , the isi and fsi factors are different for @xmath3 and @xmath7 systems , but they are fixed by independent information .",
    "our results displayed in fig .  [ fig2]-[fig4 ] may serve as predictions for the @xmath7 channel .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] exhibits the isospin dependence of the total cross section .",
    "similar to @xmath31 , @xmath139 and @xmath9 production @xcite the ratio of the @xmath7 channel to the @xmath3 channel depends on the excess energy .",
    "this means that a simple ( i.e.  constant ) isospin factor ( see discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can not relate these channels .",
    "in addition , our calculations point also to the possibility of rather different angular distributions at the same excess energy , as evidenced in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the angular distribution in the @xmath7 channel is fairly flat .",
    "the rise of the isospin dependence at low excess energies is entirely determined by the fsi effects which are rather different in the @xmath3 and @xmath7 channels . at larger excess energy",
    "the fsi effects vanish and the isospin ratio is determined entirely by the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] exposes the importance of the @xmath7 channel for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this seems to hold for the production of light vector mesons and virtual ( @xmath140 ) bremsstrahlung too @xcite .",
    "consider first the general process of dalitz decay of an on - mass shell pseudo - scalar meson @xmath13 into a real and a virtual photon ( di - electron ) . within the present approach this reaction can be considered as a two - stage process",

    "the square of the @xmath143 invariant mass is denoted by @xmath144 . since in what follows we are interested in production and decay of @xmath111 mesons , being generally off - mass shell , we use the notation @xmath145 instead of @xmath144 , bearing in mind that @xmath146 .",
    "contrarily to the vector meson case @xcite , instead of the factor @xmath147 ( due to averaging over three projections of the spin of the vector particle ) in eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) a factor of @xmath148 appears due to two photons in the final state .",
    "equation  ( [ g0 ] ) yields @xmath149 for the known width @xmath150 @xcite . in our calculations",
    "the sign of the coupling constant has been taken positively .    the transition form factor",
    "@xmath114 requires separate consideration . as stressed above",
    ", the functional dependence of form factors upon the momentum transfer is a source of information on general characteristics of hadrons , such as charge and magnetic distributions , size etc .",
    "also , form factors are known as important quantities characterizing bound states within non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the main theoretical tools in studying exclusive processes within the non - perturbative qcd are approaches based on light cone sum rules and factorization theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein quoted ) . at high @xmath151 ,",
    "i.e. , at high virtualities of quarks the hard gluon exchange is predicted to be dominant .",
    "however , since the virtuality of a quark is determined by @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is fraction part of the total momentum @xmath49 carried by quark ) the qcd asymptotic regime for low values of @xmath153 can be postponed until extremely large values of the momentum transfer and non - perturbative ( soft ) contributions play an important role in exclusive processes . in this connection",
    "an investigation of form factors in large intervals of momentum transfer , including the time - like region , serves as an important tool to provide additional information about the qcd regimes and the interplay between soft and hard contributions .",
    "besides , there is a number of more phenomenological models , e.g. , based on the dispersion relation technique @xcite , or on use of vector meson dominance models ( for details see refs .",

    "it is also known that the asymptotic behavior of the transition form factors can be determined from the corresponding axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the electromagnetic form factors are studied by electron scattering from stable particles which provides information in the space - like region of momenta where , as well known , the experimental data can be peerless parameterized by dipole formulae .",
    "this in turn means that in the unphysical region , i.e. , for kinematics outside the reach of experiments with on - mass shell particles , the analytically continued form factors display a pole structure .",
    "intensively studied form factors are the ones of the light pseudo - scalar mesons , in particular the pion .",
    "heavier pseudo - scalar meson form factors have received less attention since their experimental determination is more difficult . however , there are already experimental data on form factors of the heavier pseudoscalar mesons , such as @xmath9 and @xmath0 , most of them in the space - like region @xcite . with the spectrometer hades @xcite which can investigate with a high efficiency di - electrons production in @xmath3 collisions in a wide kinematical range of invariant masses ,",
    "an additional study of the transition form factor for @xmath154 process becomes feasible .",
    "the simplest and quite successful theoretical description of form factors can be performed @xcite with the vmd conjecture , within which a reasonably good description of elastic form factors in the time - like region has been accomplished . by using the current - field identity  @xcite @xmath155 with the coupling constants @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 known @xcite from experimentally measured electromagnetic decay widths , one can also compute the transition form factor @xmath159 by evaluating the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "the result is @xmath160 where the summation over vector mesons @xmath100 , besides @xmath161 and @xmath139 mesons , contains also heavier vector particles  @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the form factor at the origin , @xmath162 implies that @xmath163 . actually , in real calculations one takes into account only a restricted number of vector mesons , for which @xmath164 , i.e. in to obtain correct normalization , the coefficients @xmath165 must be rescaled . here",
    ", we take into account @xmath166 and @xmath139 mesons .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath165 in eq .",
    "( [ fvmd ] ) have been calculated from the rates eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) as @xmath167 the relative signs have to be fixed from some more general considerations . for instance , su(3 ) symmetry implies an opposite sign for @xmath158 relative to the corresponding couplings for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , viz .",
    "we suppose that the sign of the coupling constant @xmath169 does not depend upon the mass of the vector particle , i.e. , the ratio @xmath170 in the present paper is taken positive for all mesons .",
    "numerical calculations of @xmath165 with experimental decay rates @xcite result in @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , with a rescaling factor @xmath174 . the accordingly computed transition form factors ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) are in a reasonable agreement with the available experimental data @xcite , which usually are parameterized in a monopole form @xmath175 where the effective pole - mass parameter @xmath176 is a combination of the masses of the vector mesons .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the experimental parameter @xmath177 has been obtained by fitting data mostly in the space - like region ( @xmath178 ) . in case of time - like arguments of the form factors ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath179 the pole mass parameters @xmath180 in eq .",
    "( [ fvmd ] ) receive a small imaginary part , proportional to the total @xmath100 meson widths , @xmath181 . for the monopole parameter @xmath177 in eq .",
    "( [ monopole ] ) , we adopt the imaginary part as @xmath182 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we compare the transition form factor computed by the vmd formula , eq .",
    "( [ fvmd ] ) , with the corresponding monopole experimental fit ( [ monopole ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the form factors obtained within vmd model and fitted to data are in a good agreement in a wide interval of di - electron masses .",
    "note that in the dalitz decay @xmath70 the @xmath30 and @xmath31 poles occur in the physical region allowed for the invariant mass of the di - electrons .",
    "this implies that an experimental investigation of the @xmath140 mass spectrum in the vicinity of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 poles will provide an excellent test of the validity of the vmd conjecture at large virtualities in the time - like region .",
    "in order to emphasize the dependence upon the di - electron invariant mass we rewrite the cross section ( [ two ] ) in the form @xmath184 where we introduced dimensionless variables @xmath185,@xmath186 and @xmath187 as follows @xmath188 and @xmath189 is the branching ratio of the @xmath111 meson decay into two real photons , @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "since the total width of the @xmath111 meson is fairly small , the parameter @xmath186 in ( [ xi ] ) provides a sharp maximum of the integrand function at @xmath191 as far as the parameter @xmath192 ( or , equivalently , the di - electron invariant mass @xmath193 ) .",
    "this allows to take out from the integral the smooth function @xmath194 and calculate it at @xmath195 , i.e. at the @xmath111 meson pole mass .",
    "the remaining integral can then be carried out analytically .",
    "however , at @xmath196 when the di - electron mass is larger than the @xmath0 pole mass , i.e. , the integrand does not exhibit anymore a resonant shape , and the integral needs to be calculated numerically .",
    "equation  ( [ xi ] ) shows that the di - electron invariant mass distribution @xmath197 is proportional to the transition form factor @xmath198 so that measurements of this distribution provide a direct experimental information about this quantity . at values",
    "@xmath199 the smooth part of the integrand , @xmath200 , can be pulled out the integral at @xmath191 obtaining @xmath201 equations ( [ xi ] ) and ( [ approxint ] ) allow to define an experimentally measurable ratio which is directly proportional to the form factor @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the minimum value accessible experimentally ( in the ideal case this is the kinematical limit @xmath204 ) . at low enough values of @xmath203 ,",
    "the transition form factor is close to its normalization point @xmath205 and the ratio ( [ epsff ] ) is just the transition form factor as a function of @xmath206 .",
    "as @xmath185 approaches unity keeping the maximum position still within the integration range , one can again take out the integral the smooth function @xmath136 at @xmath195 .",
    "however , now the function @xmath207 can not be considered smooth enough and must be kept under the integration .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case the remaining integral can be computed analytically @xcite and one can still define a ratio analogously to eq .",
    "( [ epsff ] ) which allows for an experimental investigation of the form factor near the free @xmath111 threshold ( @xmath208 ) . at @xmath209",
    "the integral @xmath210 does not have anymore a sharp maximum and it ought to be calculated numerically .    in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and  [ fig8 ] the di - electron invariant mass distribution @xmath211 is exhibited as a function of the invariant mass @xmath212 calculated by ( i ) eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) with the transition form factor @xmath198 from the vmd model ( solid line ) , ( ii ) with the monopole experimental fit ( [ monopole ] ) ( dashed line ) , and ( iii ) without accounting for the form factor , i.e.  with @xmath213 , known also as qed calculations ( dotted line ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that without form factors the calculated cross section rapidly vanishes as @xmath214 , while the inclusion of the form factors results in a resonant shape of the distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the considered final state ( two nucleons , one real photon and one di - electron ) can be produced by various competing channels too .",
    "for instance , prominent channels are dalitz decays of pions and @xmath9 mesons as well .",
    "however , the contribution of different pseudo - scalar mesons to the di - electron mass distribution is well separated kinematically .",
    "thus , at low values of @xmath206 the pion contribution is predominant @xcite . at intermediate @xmath206 , close to the @xmath9 meson pole mass ,",
    "the invariant contribution of @xmath9 dalitz decay is much larger than the corresponding contribution from @xmath0 mesons .",
    "this can be understood from an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) which is valid also for @xmath9 meson production .",
    "the main difference in mass distributions occurs from different values of the total cross section @xmath215 for @xmath9 and @xmath0 production . for an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] we present a comparison of the total @xmath9 and @xmath0 cross sections as a function of the excess energy @xmath216 .",
    "it is seen that the shape of the energy dependence is basically the same , however , the @xmath9 production cross section , at equal excess energy , is larger by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , at equal initial kinetic beam energy the @xmath9 curve is essentially shifted towards higher excess energies .",
    "for instance , at @xmath217 the excess energy for @xmath0 is @xmath218 while for @xmath9 meson @xmath219 . in this case , the @xmath9 cross section becomes larger than the @xmath0 cross section by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) are of the same order for both @xmath9 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "hence , at @xmath206 close to the @xmath9 pole mass the invariant mass distribution , for the specified final state with one real photon and one di - electron , is entirely governed by the @xmath9 dalitz decay .",
    "however , at larger di - electron masses , where the ( virtual ) @xmath9 meson is highly off - mass shell , this contribution rapidly vanishes @xcite and , consequently , beyond the @xmath9 pole mass the distribution is governed by the @xmath0 dalitz decay .    nevertheless , some comments about this kinematical region are in order .",
    "since the @xmath0 mass is above the @xmath30 and @xmath31 pole masses , the transition form factor and , correspondingly the mass distribution , display a sharp peak due to smallness of the @xmath31 meson width . to get a feeling on the required detector resolution to identify experimentally such a peak , we simulate it by @xmath220 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we present the corresponding invariant mass distributions computed by taking into account this schematic detector resolution .",
    "it is seen that already for a resolution characterized by @xmath221 the @xmath31 peak essentially decreases and practically disappears at lower resolutions , @xmath222 .",
    "in summary we have analyzed the di - electron invariant - mass distribution from dalitz decays of @xmath111 mesons produced in @xmath3 and @xmath7 collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "the corresponding cross section has been calculated within an effective meson - nucleon approach with parameters adjusted to describe the free vector and pseudo - scalar meson production @xcite in @xmath39 reactions near the threshold .",
    "in particular , we found a suitable parametrization of the cross section for @xmath1 , which can be used for a prediction of the channel @xmath223 , which is important in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we argue that by studying the invariant mass distribution of the final @xmath140 system from @xmath0 dalitz decays in a large kinematical interval one can directly measure the transition form factor @xmath224 , e.g. , in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "such experiments are possible , for instance at hades , clas , kek - ps , and our results may serve as predictions for these forthcoming experiments .",
    "experimental information on form factors is useful for testing predictions of hadronic quantities in the non - perturbative qcd domain . in particular , as mentioned in introduction , the use of the quark flavor basis in a combined analysis of @xmath9 and @xmath0 mesons with one mixing angle , but with topological effects connected with the @xmath18 axial anomaly kept , provides an analytical form of the transition form factors with two terms , one related to non - strange quarks another one being entirely expressed via contributions from strange components @xcite .",
    "this is in full analogy with the vector meson dominance with the @xmath139 meson incorporated .",
    "also , a precise determination of the nucleon - nucleon-@xmath0 coupling constant @xmath20 together with an investigation of the polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering , in connection with the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite , can supply additional information on the flavor - singlet axial constant @xmath21 and on the gluon coupling @xmath22 , hence understanding of the origin of the `` spin crisis '' .",
    "we predict the transition form factor and the invariant mass distribution to exhibit maxima at di - electron masses close to the @xmath30 and @xmath31 poles , in contrast to a pure qed calculation without strong interaction effects which provides a smooth behavior of the distribution in the whole kinematical range .",
