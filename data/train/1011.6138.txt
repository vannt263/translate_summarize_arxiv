    "the key insight in what follows is that it is not the input states of @xmath0 that are relevant , rather it is the preparation procedures itself , i.e. , the preparation map @xmath11 . for a @xmath20 dimensional system",

    "let us denote this map as @xmath23-map .",
    "the form of @xmath23-map arises naturally when considering the whole process in physical terms : at the beginning of the experiment @xmath2 is in an unknown ( correlated ) state , @xmath24 .",

    "a preparation is made on the system and the corresponding output state @xmath12 is observed .",
    "this process is described by the completely positive map @xmath23 , which is a function of the initial system - environment state and the unitary dynamics .",
    "the @xmath23-map takes preparations @xmath11 to output states @xmath12 .    note",
    "that , in standard quantum process tomography state of @xmath1 is a constant of the process , here it is the initial @xmath2 state that is the constant of the process , i.e. , it is a fixed quantity .",
    "physically , the constancy of @xmath24 means that the experiment should be initialised in the same manner for every run , and then a preparation on @xmath0 can be made .",
    "@xmath23-map contains both @xmath32 and @xmath24 ; however knowing @xmath23 is not sufficient to determine @xmath32 and @xmath24 .",
    "as expected , it should not be possible to determine @xmath32 and @xmath24 through measurements and preparations on the system alone without access to the environment .",
    "conversely , @xmath23-map contains all information necessary to fully determine the output state for any preparation of @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of dealing with the @xmath23-map is that we have separated the preparation procedure from uncontrollable dynamical elements and the initial conditions .",
    "@xmath23-map contains all of the dynamical information for the system and in the next section we will extract some of this information from the @xmath23-map .",
    "first let us mention some properties of @xmath23-map derived in methods : its action on a mixture of preparations is linear , it preserves trace , it preserves hermiticity , and it is completely positive .    in methods we show that @xmath33map can be experimentally determined by making a set of linearly independent preparation of the system .",
    "this is similar to what one has to do in standard qpt . in standard qpt a linearly independent set of states",

    "the difference here is that a linearly independent set of preparations are fed in to the process .",
    "this is of our major result of this paper : we have given a prescription to determine the dynamics of a system in an operational way , i.e. , a mapping from preparations to output states .",
    "the @xmath23-map contains the dynamics of the system before any preparation is made on the system .",

    "@xmath23-map is a tensor , taking its trace with respect to the indices that belong to the initial state of @xmath0 we can obtain the dynamics of the system as if the initial correlations we absent . using this with the knowledge of the initial state of @xmath0 , in methods",
    "we show that from @xmath23 we can derive another matrix , @xmath34 matrix @xmath35 is fully determinable from @xmath33map and the two are the same when there are no initial correlations .",

    "it is an operational way of measuring the information that flows into @xmath0 due to correlations at the time of the preparation . once @xmath33map is determined , we have the full knowledge of the dynamics of @xmath0 that is due to the initial correlations .",
    "the correlation - memory matrix provides quantitative information about the initial correlation and it is more than a witness for initial correlations  @xcite .      for the special case , when the preparation is chosen to be the identity map , we get pure dynamics of the correlation - memory matrix @xmath41,\\ ] ] which is the reduced dynamics of @xmath2 correlations .",

    "@xmath23-map is the result of a quantum process tomography procedure for initially correlated system - environment states .",

    "@xmath23-map allows us to determine the output state for any preparation of the system , while the correlation - memory matrix @xmath44 provides a quantitative expression for the coherence due to the initial correlations .",
    "an important question is when is @xmath23-map relevant ?",
    "clearly , when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are initially uncorrelated then @xmath44 will be zero .",
    "alternatively , just the presence of initial @xmath2 correlations does not warrant for @xmath23-map .",
    "suppose @xmath10 but @xmath45 = 0 $ ] , then the completely positive map of eq .",
    "( [ cpmap ] ) would suffice to describe the dynamics correctly for any preparation of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "one downside to @xmath33map is that it requires a lot of resources to construct . in standard quantum process tomography @xmath46 input states",
    "are fed through the process and the corresponding output states are determined . to determine @xmath23 map , @xmath47 preparations are necessary , which is a significant growth over the standard procedure . therefore an efficient way , such as compressed sensing  @xcite , to determine this map is desirable .",
    "this should be possible , as determining @xmath23-map is equivalent to carrying out @xmath20 standard quantum process tomography procedures .",
    "another limitation that faces the procedure is the assumption that the preparation acts only on the system and not on the environment .",
    "this assumption is crucial , as we are mapping from the set of preparations on the system to the corresponding output states .",
    "if this assumption fails , then we would need to make a set of preparations that span the space of operations on the combined system - environment space .",
    "however , the environment can be arbitrarily large and we do not have any control over it .",
    "therefore the tools given in this article may not be valid when the preparation affects the environment directly .",
    "when the preparation procedure acts on @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 , the positivity of @xmath23-map may be affected .",
    "note that , as long the effect of all preparations on @xmath1 is a constant for then our prescription remains valid .",
    "lastly , since @xmath23-map contains all dynamical information , we are able to construct @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ cpmap ] ) from it .",
    "similarly , from the correlation - memory matrix , we can construct @xmath42 of eq .",
    "( [ cpmap ] ) . knowing the two we can determine @xmath9 of eq .",
    "( [ ncpmap ] ) , which can be a not - completely positive map .",
    "this gives operational meaning to not - completely positive dynamical map as the descriptor for the dynamics of the system when identity preparation is made . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - completely positive map is not experimentally determinable without determining @xmath23-map .",
    "finally , it remains an open question , when @xmath48 , is @xmath9 not completely positive ?",
    "the calculations in this sections are done in terms of matrix indices as @xmath23-map and the correlation - memory matrix @xmath43 are nontrivial tensors .",
    "we use the einstein summation notation , i.e. , repeated indices are summed over .",
    "bipartite state of @xmath2 is expressed with four indices with the latin indices belong to @xmath0 and greek indices to @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the state in eq .",
    "( [ corrmatrix ] ) has the form @xmath49 .",
    "a map acting on a density matrix is written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the sudarshan - kraus operators ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "note that any other set of linearly independent preparation can be linearly mapped to the preparations given in eq .",

    "for instance , @xmath86 and so on .",
    "the initial state of the system is labeled by indices @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "tracing over everything else we can find the initial state of @xmath0 ( before preparation ) from @xmath23-map : @xmath89 this is , of course , attainable by doing state tomography at the beginning of the experiment , by measuring the values of @xmath70 from last section .    next ,",
    "let us the trace over the system indices @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath90 the last equation is exactly the dynamical map in the absence of initial correlations , given in eq .",
    "( [ cpmap ] ) . in other words , in the absence of initial correlations , qpt would yield this map .",

    "in fact , we are not varying the initial state of the system , rather the preparation procedure on that state .",

    "as long as the preparation is trace a preserving operation we get a unit - trace matrix for the output state .      as with the case of general quantum operations",
    ", matrix @xmath23 is hermitian .",
    "this is easy to see by taking the complex conjugate of matrix @xmath23 , @xmath103 the complex conjugate of @xmath23 is not only the transpose of @xmath23 , but each element of @xmath23 is also transposed .",
    "hence @xmath23 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "the @xmath23-map is composed of a unitary matrix operating on a density matrix .",
    "then we can take the square root of the density matrix to get @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have written the @xmath23-map in operator sum representation , hence it is completely positive .",
    "where @xmath107 are the sudarshan - kraus operators  @xcite .",
    "this means , the @xmath23-map acting on any preparation procedure will lead to a physical state .",
    "this was not the case when a standard qpt procedure is carried out on initially correlated @xmath2 states .",
    "the action of @xmath23-map can now be written as @xmath108    the properties shown above are precisely the conditions for a generic quantum operation to preserve trace , hermiticity and positivity .",

    "<S> describing the time evolution of a quantum system that interacts with its environment , in its most general form , has proved to be difficult because the dynamics is dependent on the state of the environment and the correlations with it . for discrete processes , such as quantum gates or chemical reactions </S>",
    "<S> , quantum process tomography provides the complete description of the dynamics , provided that the initial states of the system and the environment are independent of each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , many physical systems are correlated with the environment at the beginning of the experiment . here </S>",
    "<S> , we give a prescription of quantum process tomography that yields the complete description of the dynamics of the system even when the initial correlations are present . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , our method also gives quantitative expressions for the initial correlation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    there is a rich history to the studies of decoherence of quantum systems due to the interactions with the surrounding degrees of freedom . when the dynamics of the system ( @xmath0 ) is markovian it can be described by a master equation  @xcite . nowadays </S>",
    "<S> many researchers are interested in systems that are non - markovian , as there is mounting evidence that some natural systems of importance may be non - markovian  @xcite and such features may allow to manipulate and control quantum systems in desired ways . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a great deal of interest in systems that are initially correlated with their environments ( @xmath1 ) because non - markovianity and initial system - environment ( @xmath2 ) correlations are intimately related  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> grasping the mathematical and physical aspects of non - markovian systems , especially with initial @xmath2 correlations , has proved to be a tough road . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there is a great deal of progress on deciding whether a system is non - markovian in the recent years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , avoiding the initial @xmath2 correlations is not always possible in reality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> working with initial correlations in practice has proved to be much trickier than in theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the presence of correlations do not allow for a clear definition of the state @xmath0 independent from the state of @xmath1 and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> physical systems are complicated and have many additional degrees of freedom that are not of experimental interest . yet </S>",
    "<S> these extra degrees of freedom interact with the degrees of interest leading to correlations . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamical map can be thought of as coming from the contraction of @xmath2 unitary dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> let us write the state of @xmath2 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the correlations matrix  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this means that @xmath9 may not a be completely positive map when @xmath10 , nevertheless it fully describes the dynamics of @xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to determine such a map experimentally would require preparing different states of @xmath0 while keeping the @xmath2 correlations fixed . </S>",
    "<S> such preparations are not operationally feasible because altering the state of @xmath0 will also alter the @xmath2 correlations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a nonpositive dynamical map is not an operationally meaningful quantity .    </S>",
    "<S> the operational approach to quantum dynamics relies on the fact that quantum theory is a theory of preparations and measurements . </S>",
