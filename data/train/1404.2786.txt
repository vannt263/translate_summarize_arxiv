    "quantum graphs provide very convenient models for studying various phenomena which are usually associated with quantum chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , they were proven to display universal spectral statistics @xcite and transport properties @xcite which are characteristic of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "quantum graphs are amply introduced and discussed in the literature , such as e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we shall be mainly concerned with their being a paradigm for quantum chaotic scattering , namely , the study of scattering through open quantum systems whose classical analogues display chaotic features @xcite . quantum graphs attract also experimental work , where the transmission through networks of quasi - one dimensional channels are considered .",
    "so far , most of the work was carried out with electro - magnetic microwaves @xcite .",
    "however , networks of optical fibers or sound waves are also considered @xcite .    scattering on graphs occurs when some of the graph vertices are connected to infinite leads .",
    "incoming waves on the leads are multiply reflected on the finite bonds in the graph , until they emerge as outgoing waves which propagate to infinity on the leads .",
    "stationary scattering theory can be applied and an explicit expression for the unitary scattering matrix can be computed , based on the structure and metric parameters of the graph and the vertex scattering matrices @xcite . the scattering within the finite part of the graph results in a complex sequence of resonances - typical for chaotic scattering of waves , but which can also display idiosyncratic effects such as the recently introduced `` topological resonances '' @xcite .",
    "in the present note we would like to extend the study of scattering through graphs , by examining the effect of noise modeled as a random , time - dependent perturbation coupled locally to the graph .",
    "this is motivated by experimental realizations of scattering graphs , which are affected by e.g. , pickup of electromagnetic noise in microwave experiments .",
    "we expected that this perturbation - even when week - is likely to affect the delicate balance of phases which are responsible for the emergence of narrow resonances .",
    "the noise pick - up mechanism is modeled here by adding to the graph a delta potential on any of its edges , at a position that fluctuates randomly in time .",
    "the position fluctuations are governed by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite .",
    "that is , it performs a one - dimensional brownian motion which is confined by a harmonic potential .",
    "our treatment is perturbative in the strength of the added potential , we however do _ not _ assume the position of the potential to change slowly ( adiabatically ) in time .",
    "the introduction of the time - dependent perturbation makes it necessary to address the problem using the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "one can not use the scattering - matrix formalism , but rather compute the mean outgoing current which emerges at each of the outgoing edges when a constant flux of mono - energetic waves is scattered on the graph .",
    "as expected , we find that the effect of noise is especially strong in the vicinity of the recently studied narrow topological resonances @xcite , that arise from the weak coupling of quasi bound states on the graph to the outside .",
    "we study the effect of noise as a function of the noise memory time , and its coupling strength ( to be chosen within the limitations set by our perturbation theory ) and find quantitatively different behavior depending on these parameters . in this context",
    "we derive expressions for the current corrections that hold for an arbitrary open quantum graph and analyze them numerically for a special graph to illustrate the effect of the perturbation on resonances .    the outline of the article is as follows : in the next section we recall some methods common in time dependent perturbation theory , and use them in a preparatory computation where the graph is taken as a single infinite line with a randomly fluctuating @xmath3 potential which induces the scattering .",
    "the general problem is discussed in section [ sect3 ] , where the fluctuating delta potential is positioned on one of the bonds of the graph .",
    "the essential features of the general theory are studied in detail for a simple yet nontrivial graph - the loop graph - which displays narrow and broad resonances .",
    "section [ sect4 ] describes some numerical results where the effect of noise on the width and position of the resonances is studied . in section [ sect5 ]",
    "we finally provide further details on the calculations leading to the results given in sections [ sections4 ] and [ sect3 ] .",
    "the perturbative procedure used to solve the schrdinger equation with a time dependent spatially and temporally localized scattering potential @xmath4 is briefly described in the following lines .",
    "( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the schrdinger equation @xmath5 with the parameter @xmath2 that will be considered small and taken as an expansion parameter for our result .",
