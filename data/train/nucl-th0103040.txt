    "the theoretical description of the a=4 continuum constitutes , in addition to its technical difficulty , a serious challenge for the nn interaction models .",
    "the remarkable success encountered in the description of the 3n system and in the 4n bound state @xcite is largely based on the three nucleon interaction ( tni ) .",
    "the two body dynamics alone looses @xmath2 in the 3n binding energy and @xmath3 in the 4n .",
    "tni compensate this defect but , a part from an energy scaling , are found to have small influence in the low energy scattering states @xcite .",
    "contrary to the a=3 case , these states present several nearthreshold structures , which can be hardly sensible to the tni and should be reproduced with the two - body forces only .",
    "a first example is provided by the n+t cross section which manifests a much more vivid behaviour than the flat n - d one , with a resonant structure at @xmath4 mev ( figure [ nd_nt ] ) .",
    "a second interesting accident is the existence of quasidegenerate n-@xmath5he and p-@xmath5h thresholds with , in their middle , the first @xmath0he excitation and all that in an energy gap of @xmath6 mev .",
    "the position of such a state , which dominates the inter - threshold dynamics , has to be ensured with an accuracy better than 100 kev in order to reproduce the experimental cross sections , what is a strong requirement for an excited state .",
    "in the case of four identical particles interacting via a two - body potential v , the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations result into two integrodifferential equations , coupling two amplitudes denoted k and h : @xmath7\\cr ( e - h_0-v)h & = & v\\left[(p_{13}p_{24}+p_{14}p_{23 } ) \\;k + p_{13}p_{24}\\ ; h\\right ]   \\label{fye}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath8 are the permutation operators and @xmath9 depending on we deal with bosons or fermions .",
    "the total wavefunction is reconstructed according to : @xmath10\\ ;                  \\left [ 1 + \\varepsilon(p_{14}+p_{24}+p_{34 } ) \\right]k\\label{psi13}\\\\ \\psi_{2 + 2 } & = & \\left [ 1+\\varepsilon ( p_{13}+ p_{23}+ p_{14}+ p_{24 } ) + p_{13}p_{24}\\right]\\;h   \\label{psi22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each amplitude f = k , h considered as a function of its own set of jacobi coordinates , is expanded in the corresponding angular variables according to @xmath11 @xmath12 are the unknowns and @xmath13 are tripolar harmonics containing spin , isospin and angular momentum variables .",
    "label @xmath14 holds for the set of quantum numbers defined in a given coupling scheme and includes the type of amplitude k or h.    boundary conditions for scattering states are of dirichlet - type . in the 1 + 3 elastic case",
    "e.g. they are implemented by imposing at large enough value of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 being the triton faddeev amplitudes previously determined .",
    "fy equations ensure a solution which , for n+t s - waves , behaves asymptotically like @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the phaseshift and @xmath20 is related to the center of mass kinetic energy @xmath21 and to the physical momentum @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the formalism and numerical methods used can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have been interested in the first @xmath24 excitation of @xmath0he , experimentally manifested as a @xmath25=0.5 mev resonant state , 0.4 mev above the pt threshold @xcite .",
    "using mt i - iii potential @xcite we got @xcite the binding energies ( b ) and r.m.s . radius ( r ) displayed in table [ tab_he_mt ] ,       calculations have been pursued beyond zero energy .",
    "one can see from figure [ nt_av14 ] ( dashed curve ) , that two - body realistic potentials alone fail in describing the low energy cross section as they failed in giving the binding energies @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this failure is in fact already present in the n+d case , although somehow hidden because the sizeable disagreement concerns only the doublet scattering length which turns to be very small compared to the quartet one and it is furthermore suppressed by statistical factors .",
    "to improve this situation we introduced the phenomenological tni : @xmath28 using the parameter set @xmath29 , we got an overall low energy agreement with the values @xmath26=8.48 mev , @xmath27=29.0 mev , @xmath30=4.0 fm , @xmath31 fm , @xmath32 fm and @xmath33=168 @xmath34 and a satisfactory n+t s - wave cross section ( solid line ) .",
    "we point out that some dispersion exists in the experimental results which makes difficult the comparison with theoretical values . if one assumes the two last measurements @xcite of @xmath35 to be valid , our calculations are not far from the proposed value @xmath36 . in this case , however , our scattering lengths are not compatible with those infered from experiment , which are in their turn incompatible with each other",
    ". a more precise measurement of @xmath33 would be helpful .",
    "for that purpose the possibilities offered by the neutron beam facility , recently approved at cern @xcite , could deserve some attention from the nuclear few - body community .",
    "if the inclusion of tni is determinant in the n+t s - wave region , it does nt improve the resonance peak , on the contrary . in a first tentative to explain this discrepancy we have included p - waves in the nn interaction @xcite .",
    "we found that although separated p - waves had significant influence in the cross section , their global effect was very small and they could not explain the disagreement .",
    "a recent work done by a. fonseca @xcite using ags equations and 1-rank approximation , was able to push expansion ( [ kpw ] ) further than we could do and found a satisfactory description .",
    "it would be interesting to have independent confirmation of this result and go beyond the first obstacle of the a=4 continuum .",
