    "the angular misalignment between the optical bar and the infrared dust pattern , @xmath31 , is approximately 20@xmath0 after correcting for inclination effect .",
    "uncertainties of these parameters can be as large as @xmath32 , due mostly to simplistic assumptions concerning projection effects and the difficulty in decoupling the bar from the bulge ( martin 1995 ; martin & friedli 1997 ) , especially in the irac 8@xmath3 m image . nevertheless , this angular misalignment , assuming it represents the misalignment between the dust and stellar patterns , belongs to one of the largest misalignments found in previous observations or in typical numerical simulations .",
    "besides the bright stellar bar , a faint and clumpy bar - like structure appears to be present in the sdss @xmath33-band image ( fig .",

    "unsharp masking was made by using a 2-pixel wide ( 2@xmath34 ) gaussian filter .",
    "the deconvolution was performed with the task lucy ( lucy 1974 ) in iraf , using a point - spread function derived from the associated psfield file of the sdss data ; the total number of iterations is 30 .",
    "the pa of this faint bar - like structure is approximately 15@xmath0@xmath12@xmath0 , so it is spatially coincident with the patterns in @xmath5-band and 8@xmath3 m images .",
    "the bar bright at optical ( sdss ) and irac 3.6 , 4.5 @xmath3 m is known to be dominated by old stellar population .",

    "this comparison shows that the stellar bar bright in optical and irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath3 m bands is evolved , with a mean age of the order of 4 gyr .",
    "the pattern bright at 8@xmath3 m is dominated by the strong 7.7@xmath3 m pah feature and warm dust continuum emission from very small grains , while the pattern shown in the irac 5.8@xmath3 m image is probably a mixture of stellar and dust ( 6.2@xmath3 m pah and warm dust ) components . from the correlation between 8@xmath3 m dust emission and star formation activities ( wu et al .",
    "2005 ; calzetti et al . 2005 ) and the previous result that 8@xmath3 m dust and 24@xmath3 m hot dust emission are well correlated on kiloparsec scalesm emission , which is mainly due to hot dust emission from very small grains , is thought to be a good measure of the sfr in galaxies ( e.g. , wu et al .",

    "2006 ; r. c. kennicutt , priv .",
    "comm . ) , however , argue that pah emission is likely a better tracer of the general ism rather than star - forming regions heated by young , massive stars .",
    "the coincidence of the bar shown in the @xmath5-band with that bright at 8@xmath3 m ( fig .",

    "the sdss spectrum , taken through a 3@xmath6-diameter ( @xmath40.58 kpc ) fiber , indicates that the central region can be classified as an `` h ii nucleus '' ( ho et al .",

    "( 2005 ) : @xmath41 an aperture of 3@xmath6 diameter was selected for measuring the sfr centered on the nucleus using the dust - only 8@xmath3 m image , to enable a sensible comparison with the sfr derived from the h@xmath2 flux .",
    "the sfr measured in this way is 0.0079 @xmath15 yr@xmath40 , consistent with that derived from h@xmath2 .",

    "the enhanced 8@xmath3 m emission in the central region of is consistent with the result that barred galaxies tend to have strong central excesses in 8@xmath3 m emission ( regan et al .",
    "2006 ) , which suggests that bars induce gas inflows toward the center of galaxies as an internal process of galaxy secular evolution ( e.g. , sakamoto et al . 1999",
    "; sheth et al . 2000 , 2002 , 2005 ;",
    "jogee et al .",
    "we also estimated the total sfr along the bar after excluding the contribution from the central region .",
    "the photometry was performed on the dust - only 8@xmath3 m image using an ellipse with a semi - major axis of 3@xmath6 and an ellipticity of 0.5 , chosen to match the isocontour of the dust pattern .",
    "the measured sfr for the bar and nucleus is @xmath40.0150 @xmath15 yr@xmath40 , which implies that the sfr along the bar is roughly 0.0072 @xmath15 yr@xmath40 , comparable to the value at the nucleus .",
    "martin & friedli ( 1997 ) found that the h@xmath2 bars ( tracing young stars and h ii regions ) and stellar bars are misaligned by up to 10@xmath0 among 11 barred galaxies .",
    "friedli & benz ( 1993 , 1995 ) , using their n - body + sph simulations of spontaneous bar formation , showed that the h ii regions tend to lead the stellar bar by an angle of several degrees . in these simulations",
    "the misalignments between bars are similar to those observed , and they occur as a result of orbit crossings of gas motion , mostly at early epochs during the formation of a strong , fast - rotating bar in the absence of an inner lindblad resonance ( martin & friedli 1997 ) .",
    "the best example is , in which star formation is completely absent in the galaxy nucleus ( martin & friedli 1997 ) , and the age of the bar is young ( @xmath4400 myr ; martin & roy 1995 ) . but this is unlikely to be the case in , due to the fact that the age of its stellar bar ( @xmath44 gyr ) is much older than bars in the spontaneous bar formation scenario ( e.g. , ) .",
    "alternatively , perhaps the morphology of this galaxy represents an episode shortly after the capture of a small , secondary galaxy .",
    "in such a galaxy merger scenario , the stellar and dust patterns may have different formation histories .",
    "the stellar bar may have formed previously as in a spontaneous formation scenario , and the dust pattern could be tidally induced later from a dwarf galaxy swallowed by .",
    "the different stellar populations in the stellar bar and the dust pattern ( see  3.2 ) also support this scenario .",
    "berentzen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the dynamical effects of the interaction between an initially barred galaxy and a small companion , using n - body / sph numerical simulations .",
    "they found that the interactions can produce offset bars , nuclear and circumnuclear disks , and tidal arms connected to the end of the bar .",
    "based on their results that the fate of the stellar bar is determined by the impact position , we speculate that in there may have been an impact on the bar major axis when the bar was weak .",
    "in such a case , the tidal force exerted on the bar does not disrupt much the bar structure ( i.e. , the stellar bar survived after the impact ) .",
    "the nearby bright , compact object toward the northeast of the sdss images ( see fig .",

    "its colors are very blue ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and similar to those of irregular galaxies ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) . and its absolute magnitude ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for _ u , g , r , i , z _ , respectively ) are located at the faint end of the luminosity function of extremely low - luminosity galaxies ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) , if we assume that its distance is the same as that of ( 39.9 mpc ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that it is a foreground white dwarf star superposed on , since its very blue colors are consistent with those of spectroscopically identified white dwarf stars in sdss ( kleinman et al .",

    "<S> a large position angle misalignment between the stellar bar and the distribution of dust in the late - type barred spiral was discovered , using mid - infrared images from the _ spitzer space telescope _ and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the angle between the bar and dust patterns was measured to be 25@xmath0@xmath12@xmath0 , larger than most of the misalignments found previously in barred systems based on h@xmath2 or h </S>",
    "<S> i / co observations . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar bar is bright at optical and 3.6@xmath3 m , while the dust pattern is more prominent in the 8@xmath3 m band but also shows up in the sdss _ u _ and _ g_-band images , suggesting a rich interstellar medium environment harboring ongoing star formation . </S>",
    "<S> this angular misalignment is unlikely to have been caused by spontaneous bar formation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the stellar bar and the dust pattern may have different formation histories , and that the large misalignment was triggered by a tidal interaction with a small companion . a statistical analysis of a large sample of nearby galaxies with archival _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> data indicates that bar structure such as that seen in is quite rare in the local universe .    </S>",
