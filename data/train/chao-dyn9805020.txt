    "another , more symmetric version of the quantum map was found by saraceno  @xcite .",
    "a general construction allowing one to quantize a class of piecewise linear maps on the torus ( including the baker map ) was given by de  bivre , degli  esposti , and giachetti  @xcite . while another quantization scheme was recently proposed by rubin and salwen  @xcite .",
