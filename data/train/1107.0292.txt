    "the numerous quarkonium - production puzzles at hadron colliders were attributed not too long ago to non - perturbative effects associated with channels in which the heavy quark - pair is produced in a colour - octet state  @xcite . @xmath8 and @xmath9 corrections to the csm",
    "@xcite are now widely recognised as essential to understand the @xmath6 spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath10 produced in high - energy hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "this calls for a factorised description of high-@xmath6 @xmath0 beyond leading power  @xcite .",
    "the effect of qcd corrections is also manifest in the polarisation predictions . while the @xmath0 and @xmath10 produced inclusively or in association with a photon",
    "are predicted to be transversely polarised at lo , it has been found that their polarisation at nlo is increasingly longitudinal when @xmath6 gets larger @xcite . in recent works",
    "@xcite , we have also shown that the csm alone is sufficient to account for the magnitude of @xmath11 at rhic , tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "we evaluate here the @xmath6 dependence of the  yield and its polarisation at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "we describe the procedure used to obtain a first evaluation of some dominant contributions at @xmath4 ( nnlo@xmath5 ) in addition to the yield at nlo ( up to @xmath12 ) .",
    "we then compare available data from the tevatron and the lhc with our results : the direct yields differential in @xmath6 along with the polarisation vs @xmath6 for the prompt yield using an essentially data - driven estimation of the polarisation for @xmath0 from @xmath7 .",
    "for the nlo cross section , we use the partonic matrix elements of  @xcite . in order to investigate the expected impact of nnlo qcd corrections for increasing @xmath6",
    ", we also present the nlo results plus the real - emission contributions at @xmath4 evaluated along the lines of  @xcite , referred to as nnlo@xmath5 . at @xmath4 , the last dependence when going further in the @xmath13 expansion : @xmath14 is the slowest possible fall - off . above @xmath4 , usual expectations for the impact of qcd corrections would then hold .",
    "one would expect a @xmath15 factor multiplying the yield at nnlo accuracy , which would be independent of @xmath6 and of a similar size as those of other qcd processes .",
    "a further enhancement by an order of magnitude between the nnlo and n@xmath16lo results would be quite worrisome . ]",
    "kinematically - enhanced topologies open up , with a @xmath14 fall off of @xmath17 .",
    "the procedure used here for the nnlo@xmath5 is exactly that of  @xcite : the real - emission contributions at @xmath4 are evaluated using madonia  @xcite by imposing a lower bound on the invariant - mass squared of any light partons ( @xmath18 ) . the dependence on",
    "this cut should decrease for larger @xmath6 since no collinear or soft divergences can appear there for the new channels opening up at @xmath9 with a leading-@xmath6 behaviour , _",
    "i.e. _  the ones which interest us . for other channels ,",
    "whose born contribution is at @xmath19 or @xmath8 , the cut would produce logarithms of @xmath20 .",
    "these are not necessarily small , but they are expected to be factorised over their corresponding born contribution , which scales as @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "they are thus suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath6 with respect of the leading-@xmath6 contributions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the sensitivity on @xmath23 is expected to be small at large @xmath6 .     for direct @xmath0 production from nlo and nnlo@xmath5 cs contributions at @xmath24 ( left ) and at @xmath25 for central ( middle ) and",

    "the csm is very close to the existing data , if the upper range of the nnlo@xmath5 is a relevant evaluation of the nnlo .",
    "the uncertainty bands at nlo are obtained from the _ combined _ variations of the charm - quark mass ( @xmath26 gev ) , the factorisation @xmath27 and the renormalisation @xmath28 scales chosen in the couples @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the band for the nnlo@xmath5 is obtained using a combined variation of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 gev@xmath34 .",
    "we have used the nlo set cteq6_m  @xcite and have taken @xmath35 gev@xmath16 and br@xmath36 .",
    "the polarisation parameter @xmath37 is extracted bin by bin in @xmath38 or @xmath6 from the normalised distribution of the polar angle @xmath39 between the @xmath40 direction in the @xmath0 rest frame and its direction in the laboratory frame , @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath37 is also related to a ratio of the polarised cross sections : @xmath42 .    for the time being , there does not exist any measurement of direct @xmath0 polarisation , _",
    "i.e. _  after the extraction of the @xmath7 feed - downs ( up to 30 - 40 % ) which may strongly impact on the observed values of @xmath37 .",
    "it is however possible to constrain its effects by using existing data on @xmath43 and by relying on e1 dominance for the transition @xmath44 .    indeed , using e1 dominance  @xcite",
    ", one can obtain  @xcite a range of the yield of longitudinally ( transversely ) polarised @xmath0 in terms of simple relations involving the polarised @xmath7 yields .",
    "allowing for extreme cases , these relations allow the yield from @xmath7 to be fully transversely polarised , while there is a minimal value of @xmath37 . following the discussion of  @xcite and taking @xmath45@xcite ,",
    "one obtains @xmath46 , rather different than -1 .     for prompt @xmath0 in  at @xmath24 ( red band ) , the direct nlo @xmath37 ( gray line ) , the direct nnlo@xmath5 @xmath37 ( thinner dark - red band ) and the cdf data  @xcite for prompt @xmath0 . ]    since @xmath47 of the @xmath0 come from @xmath7 nearly independent of @xmath6 in the range considered here  @xcite , we expect a partial contribution to the polarisation ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 . regarding the other @xmath50 , one multiplies the result for the direct yields by @xmath51 , since the polarisation of @xmath0 from @xmath52 is expected to be identical to the direct one . doing so , one obtains the extrapolation shown on  fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "if the @xmath0 from @xmath7 yield is strongly transversely polarised ( the upper limit ) , the polarisation of the prompt yield is in rather good agreement with the data .",
    "we have evaluated the nlo and nnlo@xmath5 @xmath0 yield at tevatron and lhc energies . as found for @xmath10 at the tevatron  @xcite and for @xmath0 at rhic  @xcite ,",
    "the upper bound of the csm predictions is very close to the experimental data from cdf , atlas , cms and lhcb .",
    "however , the nnlo@xmath5 evaluation is not a complete nnlo calculation .",
    "it is affected by logs of an ir cut - off whose effect might not vanish as quickly as one has anticipated .",
    "it may very well be that the upper limit of the prediction close to the data accurately reproduces the complete nnlo yield , or that the lower limit close to the nlo yield reproduces the nnlo yield . if the upper limit of the nnlo@xmath5 does indeed overestimate the nnlo , the csm alone is likely insufficient to account for the data .",
    "conversely , the csm alone is enough and the colour - octet contributions are not required .",
    "as regards polarisation , we have derived a range for the prompt yield polarisation .",
    "this range is affected by admittedly large theoretical uncertainties , but the upper edge  corresponding to a transversely polarised feed - down is in rather good agreement with the data from the tevatron .",
    "we recall that the trend for a longitudinally ( direct ) @xmath52 yield  @xcite was also met by the nnlo@xmath5  @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the csm may very well provide a good description of @xmath0 production in high - energy @xmath1 collisions , both in terms of the cross section and the yield polarisation .",
