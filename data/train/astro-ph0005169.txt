    "a systematic analysis of the x - ray spectral properties of a sample of 22 so - called narrow line seyfert1s ( nls1s ) based on asca observations has shown evidence for a broad absorption feature centred in the energy range 1.1 - 1.4kev , in 6 of the 22 objects @xcite .",
    "the absorption feature strength is typically about 100ev with an intrinsic width ranging from 0.1 to 0.3kev . until now",
    ", this type of absorption has never been detected in broad line seyfert1s ( bls1s ) spectra .",
    "only 3 nls1s exhibit absorption edges in the 0.7 - 0.9kev range consistent with that seen in at least 50% of the bls1s .",
    "several explanations of the 1.1 - 1.4kev absorption features have been proposed : a blueshift of  edges or lines ( outflow : z@xmath00.2 - 0.6c ) @xcite ; resonance absorption lines from mg , si , s and fel @xcite ; an enhancement of fe or ne @xcite .",
    "the calculations are made with the photoionization code pegas adapted for optically thin media @xcite . + a photoionized plasma is characterized by its ionization parameter : @xmath1=@xmath2 , where l is the bolometric incident luminosity ( ergs@xmath3 ) , n@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the hydrogen density and r ( cm ) is the distance of the inner layer of the cloud from the ionizing incident source . + @xmath6 + nls1s tend to be stronger soft x - ray emitters with respect to bls1 , and often have steeper photon indices : @xmath7(2 - 10kev)=1.62.5 @xcite .",
    "their soft excesses can be modelled as blackbody ( bb ) emission superposed on an underlying power law ( pl ) .",
    "we consider a `` typical incident nls1 continuum '' as the sum of a bb at t=130ev and a pl with @xmath8 ( f(e)=e@xmath9 ) and with l@xmath10(2 - 10 kev)=3 . for a given @xmath1 and n@xmath11 ( column density in @xmath12 )",
    "the `` typical incident nls1 continuum '' gives less absorption and higher ionization states than a single pl with the same slope .",
    "this could explain why the absorption features in nls1s are located at higher energies .",
    "@xmath6 +    figure  1 shows the transmitted spectrum obtained for an iron overabundance of a factor 10 , as well as the spectrum for a solar iron abundance .",
    "an iron overabundance could be responsible for a strong absorption above 1kev ( + some ) and a weak oxygen absorption .",
    "@xmath6 + the emission ( @xmath13 ) depends on the covering factor ( f@xmath14 ) of the medium responsible for the absorption ( @xmath15  f@xmath16 ) .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the great importance of the emission lines on the observed spectrum .",
    "+ @xmath6 + the warm absorber in bls1s could be purely photoionized , but an additional ionization process such as collision or a non pure radiative equilibrium are not ruled out @xcite .",
    "this could be also the case in nls1s . as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , a pure photoionized case and a hybrid case ( t=3.6  @xmath17k ) have different line ratios and different profiles of absorption ( for the same incident continuum and @xmath1 ) .",
    "in the hybrid case , higher ionisation states occur ( i.e. , ) and for a non negligible covering factor ( f @xmath18 0.5 ) , the spectrum exhibits an absorption above 1kev but no oxygen edges , which could explain the lack of detection of oxygen edges in the spectra of the 6 objects with broad absorption above 1kev .",
    "several properties of nls1s eg . uv - x - ray energy distribution , iron overabundance , hybrid plasma with high covering factor , could account for the peculiarities observed in some soft x - ray spectra of these objects .",
    "the spectral resolution attainable by asca was insufficient to disentangle between these different possibilities .",
    "the new x - ray satellites ( chandra , xmm - newton ) offer the prospect of detailed spectra that will certainly allow us to determine the nature of the 1kev feature ( emission or absorption ) . moreover",
    "x - ray spectroscopic diagnostics such as those based on the ratios of he - like ion lines will enable us to determine the ionizing process ( either pure photoionization , or photoionization plus an additional ionization process ) , as well as the gas density @xcite .",
    "the determination of the physical parameters for the warm absorber media in nls1s and in bls1s will provide constraints on unified schemes .",
