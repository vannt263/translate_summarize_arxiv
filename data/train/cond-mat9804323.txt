    "forces are a basic quantity needed in understanding microscopic systems , @xmath4 they are basic inputs to molecular dynamics simulations and to predicting the equilibrium structures . for a system of electrons and nuclei in thermal equilibrium",
    ", it is a very good approximation to assume that the electrons follow the motion of the nuclei adiabatically .",
    "the forces exerted on those nuclei due to the fast moving electrons are known as the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) forces .",
    "ehrenfest@xcite first related the force to the expectation value of the gradient of the potential which led to the hellmann - feynman theorem@xcite .",
    "accurate results have been obtained using this theorem within the framework of the local density functional theory ( lda)@xcite . unlike the energy , the force is directly related to the optimized geometry ( @xmath5 when @xmath6 ) and it allows one to probe every single nucleus in the system ; one can determine the forces on each nucleus and optimize their individual positions concurrently .",
    "in conjunction with the total energy , the force can be used to help to construct the potential energy surface . with energies known at certain grid points ,",
    "a more accurate fit can be obtained if one knows the derivatives at those points also .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are capable of treating many - body effects directly , which is essential in cases where the electron correlations are important . the computational demand of qmc scales as @xmath7@xcite or less where @xmath8 is the number of particles , while other methods , which depend on a complete representation of the many - body wave function or density matrix , such as configuration interaction ( ci ) , have an exponential dependence on the size of the system . for qmc simulations ,",
    "the total energy of the system usually has a variance which is proportional to the size of the system , making it difficult to distinguish the contribution of a single particle and the effect of a local displacement of nuclear positions .",
    "consequently , the ability to calculate forces with qmc methods provides not only a good test of the accuracy of the commonly used lda calculations but also an accurate many - body approach that could be applied to extended systems .",
    "the calculation of forces with qmc methods is a long standing important problem .",
    "there has been some progress@xcite in the calculation of forces with both variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) , however , they are still limited to relatively small systems , for example , lih@xcite , bh@xcite and cuh@xcite .    the most straight forward approach to estimate forces would be to calculate the total energy difference between two sets of nuclear configurations which are close together .",
    "then the force , for example the force component in @xmath9 direction on nucleus @xmath10 , can be approximated as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position of all nuclei and @xmath13 is for nucleus @xmath10 .",
    "however , due to the statistical nature of monte carlo , the energy estimation is always associated with a statistical error @xmath14 and the error for the force is then @xmath15 for independent sampling of @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "hence the error diverges as @xmath17 making this simple approach impractical .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem expresses the force as the expectation value of the potential gradient with respect to the wave function @xmath18 : @xmath19 this approach is well suited for hartree - fock or lda type calculations where the trial wave functions are the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian without statistical fluctuations .",
    "however , as illustrated in ref . , the variance of this force estimator is infinite for coulomb systems because of the @xmath20 behavior of the potential as electrons approach a nucleus .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to get a reliable estimation of the force by monte carlo methods using this estimator .",
    "there are other analytical derivative methods for qmc .",
    "for example , one can explicitly carry out the derivative of the variational or diffusion monte carlo energy estimator @xcite : @xmath21 and express the force as a function of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the trial wave function and @xmath25 is electronic coordinate .",
    "note @xmath26 , which is the exact ground state wave function of the system , is unknown .",
    "one either needs to find a good approximation to @xmath22 or use further diffusion monte carlo walks to calculate it .",
    "also , it may be difficult to determine @xmath24 .",
    "these difficulties have prevented routine calculations of forces with qmc .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the force as the derivative of the born - oppenheimer free energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates , and then evaluate the derivative with a path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique .",
    "the force estimator is local and easy to compute .",
    "it also has a much smaller variance than that of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we first review the basic formulation of pimc and then show how the force is computed .",
    "we apply this method to the molecules h@xmath0 and h@xmath27 , and find good agreement between pimc results at low temperature with those of accurate ground state calculations . to demonstrate the method works in an extended system , we study the proton - proton interaction in an electron gas , and",
    "compare it to lda calculations .",
    "path integral monte carlo is a powerful computational technique which is capable of simulating boson systems@xcite exactly and fermions @xcite accurately . besides total energy , many properties of the system , such as pair correlation function , specific heat , pressure , momentum distribution , and the boson super fluid density have been calculated . in this paper , we show how one can compute the electronic forces with pimc as well .",

    "it is much easier to obtain a good approximation to the high temperature density matrix since the system behaves like a classical system at high temperature .",
    "the pair product approximation@xcite has been shown to give much smaller errors in the density matrices compared with the primitive approximation , so a much larger time step can be used . in this approach ,",
    "one solves the exact action @xmath43 for a pair of particles and uses : @xmath44 errors occur only when three or more particles come close to each other . in our simulation , we used a matrix squaring method@xcite to numerically calculate the high temperature pair action .    because of their relevance",
    ", here we review a few properties of the coulomb pair action@xcite .",
    "the classical limit of the action is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the coulomb potential between the two particles . for large @xmath47 or high temperature",
    ", one can expand the action in powers of @xmath48 or @xmath49 ( wigner - kirkwood expansion ) to get on the diagonal : @xmath50 at small @xmath47 , quantum effects smooth the divergence of the coulomb potential . as a result ,",
    "the pair action and its coordinate derivative are finite .",
    "the cusp condition of the bloch equation gives the slope at the origin : @xmath51    now let us take into account fermi statistics . without magnetic fields , the hamiltonian is independent of spin and @xmath52 is a good quantum number .",
    "one can treat identical particles with different @xmath52 as different species and apply quantum statistics only to electrons of the same spin .",
    "let @xmath53 be the permutation operator of particle labels .",
    "then for each spin state@xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fermion density matrix and @xmath8 is the number of electrons in that spin state .    because odd permutations of fermions contribute a minus sign , a direct summation as for bosons will result in an exceedingly low efficiency as @xmath56 or @xmath8 increase@xcite",
    ". the restricted path integral monte carlo ( rpimc)@xcite solves this problem by only allowing paths which do not cross the nodal surface of the fermion density matrix .",
    "the nodes are determined by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 , the reference point , is a special point on the path .",
    "it is the value of the density matrix with respect to the reference point that restricts the paths .",
    "if one knows the exact @xmath59 dimensional nodes , the rpimc method is exact . in practice ,",
    "the nodes are not known , one introduces a trial density matrix and uses its nodes instead . in this paper",
    ", we use the nodal surface of non - interacting particle systems .",
    "this has been shown to give accurate simulations of hydrogen plasma@xcite and liquid @xmath60he@xcite .",
    "the success of such a seemingly simple restriction can be understood if one takes a more realistic pair product density matrix and applies the end - point approximation , one finds the nodal surface is exactly that of the non - interacting system@xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal corrections to the nodes scale as @xmath61 , they are important only at fairly low temperatures because the leading kinetic energy contribution is @xmath62 .",
    "rpimc gives an additional contribution to the action due to the restriction on the crossing of the nodal surface@xcite .",
    "locally the nodes can be approximated as hyper - planes . for small time step @xmath49",
    ", the nodal action is : @xmath63\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the distance of @xmath65 to the nearest nodes .",
    "now return to the problem of computing the quantum forces : consider a system of @xmath66 nuclei and @xmath67 electrons .",
    "we fix the position of nuclei ( no nuclear kinetic energy ) and calculate the born - oppenheimer free energy of the electrons as a function of the nuclear coordinates : @xmath68 the force exerted on the nuclei in thermal equilibrium is : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the partition function and @xmath71 only acts on nuclear coordinates .",

    "the nuclear coordinates are not explicitly written in the action because they are independent of the time slice and fixed during the simulation .",
    "we arrive at the formula for the force estimator by expanding the action in terms of sums over pairs of charged particles : @xmath75 note here @xmath76 and @xmath77 run over nuclear indices also . for small @xmath78 or @xmath79 ,",
    "both @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( eq . [ 3 ] ) have finite values . at large @xmath78 ,",
    "the action approaches @xmath82 .",
    "there is no divergence in this force estimator and thus the error is finite in contrast to estimators based on the hellman - feynman theorem .",
    "fermion nodes cause an additional contribution to the force .",
    "the electronic nodal surface can depend on the positions of nuclei , and so does the distance of @xmath65 to the nodes : @xmath83 when taking the derivative of the action with respect to nuclear coordinates , the change of the nodal surface will contribute a force on the nuclei : @xmath84^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial(d^id^{i+1})}{\\partial \\vec x}\\right \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , this term vanishes with non - interacting nodal surfaces because the nodal positions are independent of the nuclear coordinates .",
    "we now investigate how the computer time will depend on the time step . in general , the variance of the force estimator , @xmath85 , is a function of the time step @xmath49 . because of",
    "the high temperature approximations introduced in a pimc simulation , the force is only exact in the limit of @xmath86 .",
    "hence the behavior of the variance at small @xmath49 affects the overall efficiency of a calculation . to understand the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath49",
    ", we consider a typical , yet simple system : a hydrogen atom . assuming independent samples of slices on the path , the variance of the force is : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the relative coordinate between the electron and the proton at time step @xmath10 .",
    "the second term in the above equation is the square of the force ( zero in this case ) and is independent of @xmath49 , so we only need to estimate the first term .    both the small @xmath78 ( eq . [ 3 ] ) and large @xmath78 ( eq . [ 3 ] ) limit for the action is known .",
    "we approximate the derivative of the action as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , the thermal de broglie wavelength , is the radius inside of which quantum correction is important .",
    "the variance is thus roughly : @xmath91 the error will diverge when @xmath86 , but only very slowly , as @xmath92 .",
    "the above estimate does not take into account how quickly independent samples can be generated or how adjacent time slices are correlated , so we performed an empirical study of the efficiency using our pimc code .",
    "the efficiency of the pimc force calculation is defined as : @xmath93 it measures how quickly the variance of the force , @xmath85 , decreases as a function of computer time . here",
    "@xmath94 is the number of monte carlo steps and @xmath32 is the computer time per step .",
    "( [ h2eff ] ) shows the efficiency as a function of @xmath49 for the pimc simulation of a h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "we found that @xmath95 scales as @xmath96 .",
    "the only terms that contribute in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) are terms involving the nucleus in question and another charged particle .",
    "the dominant contributions are local .",
    "the force on a nucleus mostly comes from nearby electrons , hence the force variance is mainly due to nearby electronic paths and independent of the total number of electrons .",
    "one can preferentially move electrons that are near to the nucleus and thereby obtain a better overall efficiency of the force calculation .",
    "we performed pimc simulations of h impurities in an electron gas ( see section iv ) and found a power law behavior of the efficiency as a function of the number of electrons @xmath67 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "( [ ne_eff ] ) , @xmath97 .    to evaluate the path average in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , one samples the path space with multi - level metropolis method , the level is chosen so that the diffusion of paths in both the coordinate and the permutation space is maximized .",
    "this is discussed in detail in ref .. typically a path segment of @xmath98 slices is moved at the same time . the permutation space is sampled by cyclic exchange of the labels of three particles followed by a path move ( for rpimc , a two particle permutation gives a minus sign and is not allowed ) .",
    "this achieves ergodic sampling of the permutation space .",
    "to test the above approach , we apply it to the h@xmath0 and h@xmath27 molecules , since very accurate results for these systems are known .",
    "pimc is a finite temperature method and it is well known that an isolated coulomb system at a finite temperature would self - ionize . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we place the molecule in a periodic cube .",
    "when an electron ionizes and moves out of the simulation cell from one side , it will reenter from the other side and be captured again by the molecule .",
    "the properties of the ground state and low excited states of the system are unaffected if the cell is large enough because the wave functions corresponding to these states are very small at the cell boundary . as a result",
    ", these states hardly feel the existence of the periodic boundary condition and the wave functions are unchanged . for higher excited states and continuous states which are more spread out in space , wave functions from adjacent cells overlap with each other . those states and their energy spectrum",
    "are thus changed in such a way as to prevent the ionization .",
    "we are only concerned with the low temperature properties of the system , corresponding to the lowest states of the molecule .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is well suited for this purpose .",
    "the minimum image convention@xcite was used in calculating the coulomb interaction .",
    "no long range contributions from images are included .",
    "the ground state of hydrogen molecule ( h@xmath0 ) has two electrons with opposite spin and can be simulated as distinguishable particles .",

    "we choose the simulation cell to be a cubic box with length @xmath108 .",
    "calculations show that for @xmath109 , the boundaries do not affect the electron - proton pair correlation function at @xmath110 and a convergent result with respect to cell size is obtained .",
    "( [ h2force ] ) shows the force between the two protons as a function of inter - proton distance . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the convention that the force between the two protons is positive if repulsive .",
    "very good agreement is obtained with the essentially exact ground state calculations .",
    "we fit the forces to a straight line and determined the bond length ( which corresponds to @xmath6 ) of @xmath111 bohrs , while the `` exact '' ground state value is @xmath112@xcite .",

    "note here , in order to compare with ground state energy calculations , we corrected the time step error by extrapolating to the @xmath115 limit .",
    "this is a constant shift of the energy and is unimportant in calculating the force .",
    "clearly , the total energy is very flat , and the dependence of the energy on distance is completely dominated by the noise .",
    "the reason is two - fold .",
    "firstly , the pimc force estimator eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) has a lower variance than the finite difference estimator eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the energy is at its minimum , while the force is not and hence changes more rapidly .",
    "the extremum of the energy ( minimum , maximum or saddle points ) are physically important , thus it is important to be able to calculate the force at those points .",
    "the system of h@xmath27 does not form a stable molecule .",

    "the electrons see the `` bare '' proton charge .",
    "consequently , linear response theory is inaccurate@xcite .",

    "<S> we describe a method to evaluate electronic forces by path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) . </S>",
    "<S> electronic correlations , as well as thermal effects , are included naturally in this method . for fermions , </S>",
    "<S> a restricted approach is used to avoid the `` sign '' problem . </S>",
    "<S> the pimc force estimator is local and has a finite variance . </S>",
    "<S> we applied this method to determine the bond length of h@xmath0 and the chemical reaction barrier of h+h@xmath1h@xmath0+h . at low temperature , </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is obtained with ground state calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the proton - proton interaction in an electron gas as a simple model for hydrogen impurities in metals . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the force between the two protons at two electronic densities corresponding to na ( @xmath2 ) and al ( @xmath3 ) using a supercell with 38 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the result is compared to previous calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the effect of temperature on the proton - proton interaction . at very high temperature </S>",
    "<S> , our result agrees with the debye screening of electrons . as temperature decreases </S>",
    "<S> , the debye theory fails both because of the strong degeneracy of electrons and most importantly , the formation of electronic bound states around the protons . </S>"
