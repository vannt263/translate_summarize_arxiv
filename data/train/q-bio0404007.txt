    "r. penrose and s. hameroff developed a quantum model of the mind considering the cytoskeleton of neuron cells as the principal component that produces states of mind or consciousness [ 2,3 ] .",
    "in their model the microtubules ( mts ) perform a kind of quantum computation through the tubulins .",
    "tubulins are proteins which form the walls of the mts .",
    "they claim that the tubulins work like a cellular automata performing that kind of computation . in this way",
    ", the walls of the mt could be able to store and process information by using combinations of the two possible states ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) of the tubulins .",
    "the mt interior works as an electromagnetic wave guide , filled with water in an organized collective state , transmitting information through the brain . a gelatinous state of water in brain cells , which was observed by [ 13 ] , could boost these communication effects .    using a different approach , tuszynski et al .",
    "[ 6 - 8 ] model the biophysical aspects of the mts considering the following questions : what kind of computing do microtubules perform ?",
    "how does a microtubule store and process information ?",
    "in order to analyze these questions they use a classical approach , studying the basic physical properties of the mts as interacting electric dipoles .    according to [ 6 - 8,14 - 17 ] each tubulin has an electric dipole moment @xmath2 due to an asymmetric charge distribution .",
    "the microtubule is thus a lattice of oriented dipoles that can be in random phase , ferroelectric ( parallel - aligned ) and an intermediate weakly ferroelectric phase like a spin - glass phase .",
    "it is natural to consider the electric field of each tubulin as the information transport medium .",
    "therefore , the tubulin dimers would be considered the information unit in the brain and the mt sub - processors of the neuron cells .",
    "therefore , to know how mts process information and allow communication inside the brain is a fundamental point to understand the mind functions .    in this work",
    "we derive some results which were not explicitly obtained in [ 6 - 8 ] and extend the ideas introduced by [ 6,16 ] using the point of view of the information theory .",
    "we analyze the problem of information transfer and storage in brain microtubules , considering them as a communication channel .",

    "we discuss the implications of assuming that the consciousness is generated by the microtubules as sub - neuronal processors .",
    "the cytoskeleton has a dynamic structure which reorganizes continually as the cells change their shape , divide , and respond to their environment .",
    "the cytoskeleton is composed of intermediate filaments , actin filaments ( or microfilaments ) , and microtubules .",
    "the filaments and the microtubules are mutually connected and form a three - dimensional network in the cell .",
    "there are many papers [ 6 - 8 ] showing that the cytoskeleton is the main component which organizes the cell , mediates transport of molecules , organelles , and synaptic vesicles",
    ". the cytoskeleton possibly receives signals from the cellular environment mediated by the membrane of proteins and participates in signal transmission to the neighborhood of the cell [ 16,17 ] .",
    "microtubules are hollow cylinders whose exterior surface cross - section diameter measures @xmath3 with @xmath4 arrays of protein dimers called tubulins .",
    "the interior of the cylinder contains ordered water molecules which implies the existence of an electric dipole moment and an electric field .",
    "the mts represent a dipole due to individual dipolar charges of each tubulin monomer .",
    "the microtubule dipole produces a fast growth at the plus end towards the cell periphery and a slow growth at the minus end .",
    "the mt polarity is closely connected with its functional behavior which can be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of microtubule - associated protein ( map ) [ 6 - 8,14 - 17 ] .",
    "guanosine triphosphate molecules ( gtp ) are bound to both tubulins in the heterodimer .",
    "after polymerization , when the heterodimer is attached to the microtubule , the gtp bound to the @xmath1-tubulin is hydrolyzed to the guanosine disphosphate ( gdp ) .",
    "on the other hand , the gtp molecule of the @xmath0-tubulin is not hydrolyzed .",
    "the microtubules present a calm dynamic instability which are their principal feature [ 6 - 8].@xcite    many models of conformation ( and polarity energy ) of the microtubular protofilament were developed .",
    "these models describe the behavior of the pulses generated by the free energy in the gtp hydrolysis .",
    "the pulses propagate along of the mts through an elastic coupling or through electric field propagation between tubulin dimers [ 5 - 8,14,15 ] .",
    "the overall effect of the surrounding dipoles on a site @xmath5 can be modelled by the double - well quartic potential [ 6 - 7 ] @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the dimer conformational change on the _ n  th _ protofilament axis coupled to the dipole moment . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters of the model , where @xmath8 is dependent of the temperature by @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the critical temperature , and @xmath9 is a positive parameter independent of the temperature [ 6,8 ] . in figure 1",

    "molecules can contain energy in the chemical bonds , in the excited electron states , in the conformation states , etc .",
    "a common measure of the interaction leading to cooperative behaviour is the information transference .",
    "the electromagnetic field can transfer information through the environment among the systems like a communication channel .",
    "many features of the cytoskeleton support the idea that microtubules can perform computation and store information . according to [ 6 ]",
    "the charge separation of the mts is wide enough to store information . due to its dynamic coupling",
    "the information can be stored as mechanical energy and chemical events .",
    "changes in the opposite direction can be favorable to the sg phase over the f - phase .",
