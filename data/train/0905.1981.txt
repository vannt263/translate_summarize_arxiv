    "the optical continuum emission in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) almost certainly originates as thermal emission from the accretion disc @xcite but the origin of the x - ray emission in these objects is less clear .",
    "the accretion disc is expected to be too cool to produce x - rays and the spectrum in this band is non - thermal , so the existence of a ` corona ' has been suggested to produce x - ray emission by compton up - scattering optical / uv photons to higher energies . as it has not been established how this corona is formed ,",
    "its location and relation to the accretion disc are uncertain , although variability and energetics arguments place it in the innermost regions of the agn .",
    "one way to probe the connection between the accretion disc and corona is to track the variability in x - ray and optical bands simultaneously , to determine their degree of correlation and the relative location of their emitting regions by measuring delays between the fluctuations in both bands .",
    "if the x - rays are produced by a corona in the vicinity of an optically thick accretion disc , it is expected that at least some of the x - ray flux will be intercepted by the disc and be reprocessed thermally into optical emission .",
    "the short variability time - scales observed in optical bands and the short delays with respect to the x - ray variations suggest that the optical variability arises from reprocessing of the highly variable x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "the radial temperature profile for a standard accretion disc , @xmath2 , places the main optical emitting regions at different radii in the disc , leading to longer light travel times for longer wavelength optical emission .",
    "the wavelength dependent delays predicted by this model are in agreement with the observations of several agn @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing number of objects , however , whose x - ray / optical behaviour is in conflict with a model where reprocessing is responsible for all the optical variability .",
    "long time - scale optical fluctuations have higher amplitude than their x - ray counterparts in at least three cases , ngc  5548 @xcite , mr  2251 - 178 @xcite and mkn  79 @xcite .",
    "x - rays have been seen to lag the optical bands in e.g.  ngc  4051 @xcite and mkn  509 @xcite and @xcite have modeled in detail the reprocessing in the case of ngc  3516 and shown that this process is unable to explain its optical variability .",
    "reprocessing is also challenged by energetics arguments in some agn , where the luminosity in the optical bands largely exceeds the luminosity in x - rays , making it impossible for the x - rays alone to produce the observed large amplitude optical flux variations @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a composite model to explain the x - ray optical correlation in mr  2251 - 178 .",
    "we allowed a small fraction of the optical emission to arise from reprocessing , in order to produce the observed small amplitude , rapid optical fluctuations , with a negligible delay with respect to the x - rays .",
    "at the same time , the long term variability in both optical and x - ray bands would be modulated by accretion rate fluctuations , allowing different amplitudes of variability in both bands on long and short time - scales .",
    "predictions of this two - component scenario should be tested on agn of different masses and accretion rates , @xmath3 , since the location of the optical emitting region on a standard accretion disc depends on these parameters ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "low @xmath3 and high mass black holes should have a relatively cool disc , placing the optical emitting region at small radii , probably close to the x - ray emitting corona .",
    "therefore , in these cases we should expect a stronger x - ray / optical correlation and variability on similar time - scales .",
    "the opposite would happen for low mass and high accretion rate agn .",
    "we are currently building a sample of agn monitored simultaneously in x - rays and optical bands , which covers a large range in mass and accretion rate to establish the connection between their optical and x - ray emitting regions . here",
    "we present results on our third target , , which has a black hole mass of @xmath4 @xcite and average accretion rate @xmath5 of the eddington value @xcite .",
    "the structure of the agn in  has been studied through several monitoring campaigns . @xcite",
    "monitored  in the optical and infrared bands finding an @xmath6 day lag between v and k bands from a 15 year long light curve .",
    "this lag is interpreted as the light travel time between the central engine and the hot dust which reprocesses the optical / uv emission and is confirmed and studied in detail by lira et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the measured lag is at precisely the value expected for the light travel time to the dust at the sublimation radius given the luminosity of , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sparse sampling of the long light curves of @xcite , however , does not allow a measurement of lags between optical bands and the lack of x - ray coverage precludes a study of the origin of the optical variability .",
    "the structure of the broad line region ( blr ) has been studied through reverberation mapping campaigns lasting over 7 months , reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors found almost simultaneous variability in the uv and optical continua with amplitude increasing with decreasing wavelength .",
    "they also find an @xmath7 day delay between the continuum and broad - line emission variations , establishing the distance between the blr and the central continuum source .",

    "the period of daily sampling in the optical was contained within the period of intensive x - ray monitoring .",
    "we performed psf photometry on  and four non - variable stars in the field of view using the iraf task psf .",

    "we note that the underlying galaxy flux within the nuclear psf is not subtracted from the agn flux , so a relatively small amount of starlight contamination remains .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the reference stars and used the zero - point correction factors calculated for the smarts telescope every photometric night , together with the airmass of our observations , to calibrate their magnitudes .",
    "we converted these magnitudes into flux densities at 5500   for the v band and 4400  for b , assuming a flat spectrum ( @xmath10 ) within each band and used the total flux of the four stars to calibrate the relative - flux light curve of .",
    "the final light curve fluxes were corrected for foreground galactic extinction using @xmath11 for b and @xmath12 for v @xcite .",
    "@xcite used several methods to estimate the extinction towards  and concluded that it can be largely or completely accounted for by the foreground galactic value , we therefore made no further correction to the fluxes .",
    "the calibrated b and v band light curves are shown in the middle and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ lcs ] , respectively .",
    "the psf photometry method was used to include all the point source emission from the nucleus of the agn while minimising the contribution from the host galaxy but it is likely that some contamination remains .",
    "we note however that in the b band light curve the flux varies from under 9 mjy to over 24 mjy , so the majority of the flux measured must be nuclear ( assuming that the star light is constant ) . in the v band",
    "the maximum to minimum variation is slightly smaller but still more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this difference in variability amplitude can be caused by stronger star light contamination in the v band but it is also possible that the agn v emission is intrinsically less variable .",
    "the power density spectrum ( pds ) can be used to quantify the variability amplitude as a function of the time - scale of the variations , or correspondingly , of their fourier frequency .",
    "the pds is constructed through the modulus squared of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) @xcite . for the normalisation used in our calculations ,",
    "the integral of the pds over frequency equals the normalised variance of the light curve .    for most agn x - ray light curves ,",
    "the pds has a power law shape of slope @xmath13 bending to a steeper slope at high frequencies ( e.g. summons et al .  in prep . , @xcite ) , which is similar to the pds found in stellar mass black hole binaries in the soft state ( see * ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it is customary to multiply the variability power by frequency when plotting the pds , to highlight deviations of the power law slope from 1 as , in this case , the low frequency part of the pds appears approximately flat and the breaks are more noticeable .",

    "the best - fitting bend frequency is below the lowest frequency probed and the b band pds is consistent with a single steep power law model .",
    "we calculated the cross correlation between the x - ray and optical light curves using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) described in @xcite and the z - transformed dcf of @xcite .",
    "these cross correlation functions measure the degree of correlation between the two light curves as a function of @xmath26 , the displacement of one of the light curves on the time axis .",
    "a positive value of the @xmath26 will indicate that x - rays lead the optical fluctuations .",
    "we first computed the long term dcf between x - ray and b and v light curves .",
    "the intensive sections were resampled by taking 1 point every 4 days in the optical bands and 1 point every two days in the x - rays , to match the sampling of the rest of the corresponding light curve .",
    "as the rest of the x - ray light curve was sampled partly every 2 and partly every 4 days , we binned the re - sampled data into 4 day bins to obtain uniform sampling and probe similar time - scales throughout the light curve .",

    "[ psd ] , the x - ray light curve has considerably more variability power than the optical bands on these shorter time - scales . fortunately ,",
    "as the sampling of the x - ray band is more intensive we are able to cancel part of the high frequency variability in this band by binning the light curve in 1 day bins . in this way ,",
    "the correlation between fluctuations on time - scales longer than a day in both bands becomes clearer .",
    "we calculated the dcf between the 1-day binned x - rays and the v and b band intensive light curves .",

    "[ intensive ] seems to indicate that the optical bands are leading the x - rays by @xmath29 days because of the sharp drop in flux in both bands around the middle of the light curve .",

    "the only significant peak in the ccf is at positive lag values , with optical bands lagging , which make the overall intensive light curves match better .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ norm_lcs ] shows the b and x - ray light curves normalised to their mean fluxes , where the b data has been shifted back by 6 days , according to the time lag measured .",
    "it is clear that in this way the peaks in both light curves match very well , especially at low optical fluxes .",
    "the long term trend has slightly higher amplitude in the b band while the amplitude of the rapid fluctuations is much larger in the x - rays , as expected from the analysis of the pds .",
    "the measured lag of optical behind x - ray fluctuations suggests a reprocessing scenario where at least part of the optical variability is produced by the variable x - ray heating . in this case",
    ", the delay , interpreted as a light travel time , gives the distance between the x - ray corona and the location of the reprocessor .",
    "the black hole mass of  is @xmath4 @xcite producing a light crossing time for 1 gravitational radius of @xmath37 s. the time delay of optical behind x - ray fluctuations of @xmath38 days therefore corresponds to a light travel time through a distance of @xmath39 .",
    "we note however that the region on the disc where the amount of reprocessed flux peaks will not necessarily correspond to the region of peak intrinsic emission due to internal heating , since x - ray heating may dominate at larger radii as will be discussed below in sec .",
    "[ intrinsicplusreprocessed ] .      not all the optical variability can arise from reprocessed x - rays , however , as is evident from the power spectrum analysis .",
    "the pds of the b band data shows that the variability power continues to increase towards lower frequencies , at least down to frequencies @xmath40 hz , or correspondingly time - scales of @xmath1 days , while the x - ray variability power breaks and flattens for time - scales below 2 days .",
    "if all the optical variability was produced by reprocessing , the x - ray fluctuations on time - scales shorter than 100 days would have to be smoothed - out by differential light travel time to opposite sides of the reprocessor , requiring it to have a minimum radius of @xmath41 light days . in this case",
    ", the average delay between optical and x - rays would be of the same order , much longer than the measured @xmath42 day lag .    to exemplify this argument we constructed transfer functions for different reprocessing geometries .",
    "if the optical variability arises only from x - ray reprocessing then the transfer function has to produce both the smoothing of fluctuations down to time - scales of @xmath1 days and a delay of @xmath42 days between primary and reprocessed flux . in this case",
    ", the variable part of the optical light curve would be @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the x - ray light curve , @xmath45 is the transfer function and @xmath46 denotes convolution .",
    "the relation of their fourier transform would therefore be @xmath47 , so that    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to the pds of the optical and x - ray light curves , respectively , as calculated in sec .",
    "the plots in figure [ transfer ] compare this pds ratio ( calculated from the fits to the pds using eq . 1 and shown here in green triple - dot - dashed lines ) to the @xmath51 functions predicted for each case .",
    "we note that the pds ratio was calculated for optical and x - ray light curves observed simultaneously , so the variations in the pds shape expected due to the red noise nature of these light curves is not relevant .",
    "the reprocessor geometries considered were a spherical shell distribution of small clouds , a flat optically thick disc and an optically thick disc which flares out at large radii .",
    "these were chosen to mimic structures that probably exist in the vicinity of the black hole such as an optically thick accretion disc and the broad line region ( blr ) clouds . in all cases ,",
    "model parameters were adjusted to produce the observed average delay of 6 days between primary and reprocessed emission , calculated as the expectation value of the transfer function .",
    "the spherical shell produces the strongest smoothing of long - term trends for a fixed time lag , compared to the other geometries .",
    "this is because there is no delay between the intrinsic emission and the response from the side of the sphere closest to the observer .",
    "in disc geometries ( except for an edge - on view ) the intrinsic flux must first travel to the nearest side of the reprocessor , which is located out of the line of sight , delaying the start of the response .",
    "therefore , the same ` smoothing power ' can be associated with a longer delay , e.g.  if the disc is viewed face - on and the reprocessing region is concentrated in a narrow ring then there will be no smoothing of the response but the delay can be arbitrarily long , for an arbitrarily large ring radius . evidently , the spherical shell is the best bet to smooth out the long - term variability while producing a short lag , as required by the data , but we explore other geometries too for further analysis .",
    "we detail each model in the following subsections .",
    "the first geometry investigated comprised a spherically symmetric distribution of small clouds that capture x - rays from the central source and re - emit a fraction of this flux in the optical bands . given the symmetry of this setup the only parameters are the radius of the shell @xmath52 and the polar angle @xmath53 of each position on the shell to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "the delay of the response with respect to the primary emission is @xmath54 . assuming that the clouds radiate isotropically and that they do not obscure one - another , the re - emitted flux seen by the observer at a given delay @xmath26 is simply proportional to the area on the shell that corresponds to that delay , i.e. @xmath55 , for @xmath26 between 0 and @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath51 that corresponds to this setup is shown by the solid line in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ transfer ] , where @xmath52 was fitted to reproduce the observed lag .",
    "the ripples in this profile are produced by the sharp drop of the transfer function at @xmath57 .    to smooth out this drop ,",
    "the reprocessing region can span a range of radii rather than being a single thin shell . in this case",
    "the total transfer function will be the sum of the contributions from all sub - shells , weighted by the fraction of the sky covered by the clouds on each sub - shell @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we used this setup to construct the rest of the functions shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ transfer ] , taking the thickness of each sub - shell as proportional to its radius .",
    "the functions shown in the top panel of fig .  [ transfer ] correspond to the thickest possible shells for each covering fraction distribution , @xmath58 , using an inner radius of 10 @xmath60 and outer radius fit to match the observed delay .",
    "the @xmath51 functions changed smoothly from the thin shell profile to the corresponding thickest shell profile for intermediate configurations .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a @xmath58 that peaked at the middle of the shell and dropped smoothly to zero at the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "the dot - dashed line corresponds to a constant @xmath58 , where each sub - shell contributes an equal amount of reprocessed flux .",
    "the transfer function in this setup strongly peaks at small lags , where all sub - shells contribute and drops off gently towards larger lags . for very thick shells , as in the case shown in the figure , this sharp peak in the transfer function transfers some variability power on short time - scales , rising the high frequency tail of @xmath51 .",
    "this effect is more extreme in the last case , shown by the dotted line , where the covering fraction drops with radius as @xmath61 so that thick shells make the transfer function even more peaked at small lags and most of the variability power is therefore transferred .",
    "we note that this configuration over predicts the short timescale variability without reducing the long term variability enough .",
    "the second geometrical setup corresponded to the response of an infinite plane illuminated by an x - ray source at a height of 10@xmath60 following the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "we varied the inner truncation radius of the disc in order to fit the lag .",
    "the truncation is necessary because otherwise the reprocessed flux peaks at a small radius , making the light travel time to this region , and hence the delay , too short .",
    "truncating the disc further out forces the reprocessing region to appear at a larger distance from the x - ray source and determines the delay .",
    "intrinsic disc flux expected for a standard accretion disc @xcite was added to the reprocessed flux , for each radius and time delay , to calculate the b band response .",
    "the curves shown in the middle plot of fig .  [ transfer ] correspond to a face - on view ( least smoothing at long time - scales ) , an intermediate viewing angle of @xmath62 and an edge - on view ( most smoothing on long time - scales ) .",
    "the inner truncation radius needed to produce a 6 day lag in each case was 1950 , 1550 and 1300 @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the third geometry corresponds to a flared disc , illuminated by a central x - ray source .",
    "the region of the disc where the scale height increases presents a large area facing the illuminating source and dominates the reprocessed emission .",
    "this scenario can therefore produce a large lag without requiring a large inner truncation radius of the disc .    for the transfer function calculation",
    ", we assumed that the disc surface bends upwards sharply at a radius @xmath63 and the normal to the flared surface makes an inclination angle @xmath64 with respect to the plane of the flat section of the disc and has length @xmath65 .",
    "we neglect differences in emissivity and time delays from different vertical positions on the flare surface .",
    "the effective area of this region that receives emission from a central primary source is @xmath66 . if @xmath53 is the azimuthal angle on the disc from the projection of the line of sight , the delay from each position is @xmath67 and the area seen by the observer is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the viewing angle with respect to the axis of symmetry of the disc .",
    "when @xmath70 the near side of the disc is seen from behind , which makes @xmath71 negative , as the disc is assumed to be optically thick , this area does not contribute to the transfer function .",
    "the curves shown in the bottom panel of fig .  [ transfer ] correspond to different viewing angles @xmath69 and opening angles @xmath64 .",
    "the strongest smoothing shown is produced for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , requiring a value of @xmath74 .",
    "the intermediate curves show cases where the opening and inclination angles are similar so the near side of the flared disc is viewed almost edge - on . in these cases",
    "the reprocessed flux concentrates only at the far side of the disc , which is viewed more face - on . for this reason the response is retarded so the lag can increase while producing less long - term smoothing .",
    "the curves shown correspond to @xmath75 and @xmath76 with flare radii of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the least amount of long - term smoothing is produced for face - on viewing angles , @xmath79 in this case shown with an opening angle of @xmath80 and a radius @xmath81 .",
    "we note that in all the transfer functions described above , the required lag of 6 days strongly limits the smoothing power below @xmath82 hz so the observed ratio of x - ray versus b band pds can not be reconstructed by a single transfer function .",
    "this adds to the fact that the b band has slightly larger long - term variations in normalised flux than the x - rays , which is hard to reconcile with a picture where these large amplitude optical trends are produced by reprocessing .",
    "we therefore conclude that another source of long term optical variability must exist and it is probably produced by the intrinsic optical emitting region .",
    "as shown in @xcite rapid optical variability , imprinted by reprocessing on a long - term intrinsic fluctuation , can shift the ccf peak to the delay produced by reprocessing , regardless of the delay between the long term fluctuations .",
    "this is true even if the long term , intrinsic fluctuations in the optical bands have much larger amplitude than those produced by reprocessing .",
    "it is therefore possible that a small amount of the optical flux is produced by reprocessing of x - rays at a large distance from the corona , while the rest of the optical emission and variability are produced intrinsically by the accretion disc at a different radius . in this case , the measured lag is the inprint of x - ray reprocessing on optically thick material at some distance from the x - ray source , which produces the rapid optical variability and 6-day delay .",
    "we now estimate the possible location of the optical intrinsic and reprocessed emitting regions .",
    "a radiatively efficient , optically thick disc radiates approximately as a black body with a radially - dependent characteristic temperature and a total energy output defined by the gravitational energy loss .",
    "assuming such a disc emits the optical flux observed in  we can calculate the location of the optical emitting regions .",
    "we used the prescription of flux as a function of radius given in @xcite to calculate the local temperature and optical band flux for a mass of @xmath4 .",
    "we fitted the disc accretion rate in this formula to reproduce the observed optical flux obtaining a value of @xmath83 of the eddington value .",
    "we note that this accretion rate is lower than that estimated from the bolometric luminosity because it will only produce the thermal optical / ir emission from the accretion disc .",
    "it does not include the fraction of power directed into the corona ( which results in x - ray emission ) nor the additional ir flux directed into the line of sight by reprocessing structures such as the torus . the resulting 50% ( 90% ) of the b band intrinsic disc emission is contained within 73 ( 208 ) @xmath60 .",
    "given that the long term variability is probably intrinsic to this optical emitting region , we estimate the relevant characteristic time - scales . at a radius of 100@xmath60 , which contains 60% of the b and 50% of the v flux , the dynamical time - scale ( time it takes orbiting material to travel 1 rad of a keplerian orbit ) is 6.7 hours . optical variability is observed on time - scales of 300 days , i.e.  @xmath84 times longer than the dynamical timescale at this radius , so accretion rate fluctuations on the local viscous time - scale are not an unreasonable source of this variability .",
    "the viscous time - scale of a standard @xmath85-disc @xcite is @xmath86 , so in this case @xmath87 .",
    "assuming a typical @xmath88 this implies a scale height - to - radius ratio @xmath89 , a relatively thick accretion disc .",
    "alternatively , this variability time - scale could correspond to the thermal time - scale of the thin disc , as discussed in e.g.  @xcite .    the location of the _ reprocessed _ optical emission depends on the location of the x - ray source and the geometry of the reprocessor .",
    "we constructed emissivity profiles for the b and v bands assuming a simple geometry of an accretion disc with constant @xmath90 , and an x - ray source on the axis of symmetry over the disc .",
    "the intrinsic disc accretion rate used was @xmath91% of the eddington limit , a bh mass of @xmath4 and a value of @xmath89 .",
    "the x - ray flux was equal to five times the average 210 kev flux measured , to account for x - ray flux outside this band ( see * ? ? ? * for their x - ray broadband analysis using _ bepposax _ data ) and assumed that 60% of the impinging x - ray flux were thermalised by the disc ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ profile ] shows the cumulative optical flux as a function of radius for the intrinsic , reprocessed and total emission for an x - ray source height of 50 @xmath60 .",
    "the reprocessed curve was calculated as the difference between the intrinsic and total cumulative fluxes .",
    "evidently , the intrinsic and reprocessed emissivities peak at different radii with the reprocessed emission being produced further out . as this is the emission modulated by the variable x - ray flux",
    ", we should consider this outer radius to interpret the delay between x - ray and optical fluctuations produced by reprocessing .",
    "for a face - on view , the parameters used in fig .  [ profile ] produce a delay of @xmath29 hours for the x - rays to modulate up to 50% of the reprocessed flux in both b and v bands , too short to explain the observations .",
    "using a thinner disc , down to @xmath92 does not have a significant effect on this delay , nor does reducing the impinging x - ray flux down to the observed 210 kev value ( instead of five times this value as was used for the figure ) .",
    "varying the position of the x - ray source does have a strong effect on the time delay , partly because increasing the height moves the main reprocessing region further out in the disc but mostly because of the longer light travel time down to the disc .",
    "the measured delay of a few days would require the x - ray source to be located at @xmath93 over the disc .    a different geometry of the reprocessor , however , might also produce the correct time delay . for example a lower x - ray source and a flared disc would present a large area of the disc to the x - ray flux only at large radii , pushing the location of reprocessed emission further out . alternatively ,",
    "the reprocessed x - rays might come from a structure similar to the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "reverberation mapping campaigns of this source show that the broad h@xmath94 line lags the uv continuum variations by 110 days , depending on the line width @xcite .",
    "therefore , the light travel time from the centre of the accretion disc ( probable source of optical / uv continuum ) to the blr is similar to the distance between the x - ray corona and the reprocessing material . in this scenario ,",
    "the broad line variability tracks the large amplitude optical continuum fluctuations , which modulate the intrinsic optical flux originating close ( @xmath95 ) to the black hole . at the same time , the lines can be modulated by the rapid optical fluctuations , produced by x - ray reprocessing at the same radius of the blr , which already contains a delay to the intrinsic optical and x - ray emission .    recalling the three geometries of the reprocessor discussed in sec .",
    "[ transfersec ] we can now judge their ability to produce the rapid , small - amplitude optical fluctuations only . although it is not straightforward to disentangle long and short term fluctuations , we can use the low flux section in the first half of the campaign to estimate the amplitude and timescales of what are probably signs of reprocessing .",
    "the two big flares on this segment , which show a clear lag to the x - rays , have timescales of 1020 days and amplitudes of a few mjy in the b band .",
    "also , their relative amplitude is about half or less of the corresponding x - ray flares . the reprocessing mechanism ,",
    "therefore , should produce a few mjy of optical flux and not smooth out completely the variations on time - scales of tens of days .",
    "the truncated flat disc reprocessor seems unlikely , on energetics grounds because the x - ray source sees the disc almost edge - on , given the large truncation radius needed for the lag , for any reasonable source height .",
    "this small solid angle subtended by the disc produces too little reprocessed flux to make an observable signature in the optical light curves , by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this problem is circumvented when using the flared disc because the inclined or vertical portion of the disc can face the x - ray source directly , reaches a higher temperature and produces more optical flux .",
    "the blr clouds can have large enough column densities to be optically thick to x - rays ( @xmath96 , * ? ? ?",
    "reprocessing in the form of optical emission lines is possible and the effect of their fluctuations on the b and v band fluxes can be estimated from spectral monitoring .",
    "the reverberation mapping campaign on  presented by @xcite , shows that the lines in this region of the spectrum contribute around 10% of the b band flux and vary by a maximum ratio of 30% in flux .",
    "therefore , their contribution to the b and v band variability is too small to produce the observed rapid fluctuations of about 20% .",
    "the blr , however , can also produce diffuse continuum emission in addition to the lines , as shown by @xcite .",
    "these authors calculate the expected blr contribution to the optical / uv continuum in detail for the case of ngc  5548 .",
    "they show that 1020% of the observed b and v band continua can arise from blr emission and that the majority of this flux is reprocessed rather than reflected .",
    "if a similar amount of continuum emission is contributed by the blr in  and the x - rays ( and possibly uv ) incident flux is modulating this emission , then the blr clouds could correspond to the reprocessor that produces the rapid optical fluctuations and the 6-day delay .",
    "we calculated ` reprocessed ' b band light curves by convolving the observed x - rays with the transfer function of the flared disc and the spherical shell of sec .",
    "[ transfersec ] as these structures are the most promising candidates for the reprocessor .",
    "we used the intensively sampled x - ray data to produce the simulated b band light curves and compare the resulting optical vs x - ray dcf with the dcf of the real data , to select the best fit in the @xmath97 day range . in the case of the flared disc we calculated b band emission assuming that the flared portion of the disc emits as a black body at the temperature corresponding to the reprocessed x - ray flux ( as the radius is large , intrinsic heating at in this region is negligible ) .",
    "as an additional constraint in the fitting routine we required an average reprocessed flux of at least 1 mjy at the observer location , to reproduce the small amplitude optical fluctuations , which contain the 6-day delay .",
    "the height of the x - ray source was fixed at 10@xmath60 and the 210 kev flux was amplified by a factor of 5 as above , to include x - ray flux outside of this band .",
    "this setup could produce the required amount of b band flux and the correct delay for a range of parameter values .",
    "the best - fitting values were @xmath98 , @xmath73 , @xmath99 and a length of the flared region of @xmath100 . in the case of the blr reprocessor we only calculated the shape of the reprocessed light curve and relied on the numbers given by @xcite to produce sufficient reprocessed optical flux .",
    "the best - fitting geometrical parameters for this case where @xmath101 and a thickness of four times this radius .",
    "the fitted portion of the intensive dcf for both models is shown in fig .",
    "[ ccf_bestfit ] .",
    "the model parameters are not well constrained in either case and the quality of the fits are similar so this analysis only shows that both structures are feasible reprocessors .",
    "the simulated reprocessed light curves lag the x - rays by approximately the same time as the real optical data , but their dcfs peak at a higher value than the dcf of the real data .",
    "we note that the simulated b band light curves are produced only through x - ray reprocessing , so a good correlation is expected . on the other hand",
    ", the real optical light curve probably contains other sources variability , producing the long term trends as argued above , which will lower the correlation peak .",
    "we have monitored the seyfert galaxy  over two years , simultaneously in the x - ray 210 kev and optical b and v bands .",
    "the flux in all bands is highly variable on all the time - scales probed .",
    "our main conclusions drawn from the variability properties are detailed below .    1 .",
    "we recalculated the power spectrum of  in the x - ray band .",
    "our new , intensively sampled light curve was programmed to cover the time - scales where a possible qpo had been detected with earlier data @xcite . the high quality new data , however , shows that the entire pds is consistent with a single - bend power law and the possible qpo is not confirmed .",
    "the pds parameters we found are consistent with the single - bend power law model fit of @xcite , with values of @xmath102 hz .",
    "b and v bands vary simultaneously , with a delay of no more than 1.5 days .",
    "the light curves are almost identical but the fractional amplitude of variations is slightly larger in the b band",
    ". these results are consistent with those obtained by @xcite who monitored  in the uv and optical bands , finding the largest variability at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "the fluctuations in optical and x - ray bands are significantly correlated .",
    "the optical bands show a delay with respect to the x - rays of @xmath38 days .",
    "similar values are obtained for both b and v bands and for long - term and intensively sampled light curves .",
    "the pds of the optical bands is consistent with a single power law of slope @xmath103 , where the variability power increases continuously toward the longest time - scale measured , @xmath1 days .",
    "comparison with the pds of the x - ray band shows that if all optical variability arises from reprocessing of x ",
    "rays , the reprocessor would have to be @xmath104 light days across , to smooth out fluctuations on shorter time - scales .",
    "this size is inconsistent with the small value of the delay found between optical and x - ray fluctuations ( 6 days ) so another source of optical variability must exist .",
    "we interpret the optical variability as arising from both reprocessing and intrinsic accretion rate fluctuations .",
    "accretion rate variations on time - scales of hundreds of days can cause the large amplitude optical fluctuations and propagate to the x - ray emitting corona producing the long term correlation .",
    "reprocessing of x - rays can produce the short - term , small amplitude optical variations explaining the measured positive delay of optical with respect to x - rays .",
    "the most likely reprocessor geometries we investigated were an optically thick accretion disc which flares out at large radii and a spherical shell distribution of clouds . in the disc case",
    "the scale height increases at a radius similar to the location of the blr , while in the second case the reprocessor could correspond to the blr itself if the clouds can produce sufficient optical continua from reprocessed x - rays and uv photons , as discussed in @xcite .",
