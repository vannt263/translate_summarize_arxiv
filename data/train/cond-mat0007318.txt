    "crystals of rare - earth ( re ) doped quasi - one - dimensional double bromides cscdbr@xmath2 are widely studied , mainly , because of their property to incorporate re@xmath8 ions in pairs , even at low re concentrations .",
    "this makes them a promising material for up - conversion lasers .",
    "the structure of cscdbr@xmath2 belongs to the @xmath10 space group and consists of linear chains of face - sharing [ cdbr@xmath11@xmath12 octahedra along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "positional symmetry for cd@xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "re@xmath8 ions substitute for cd@xmath14 forming centers with different mechanisms of charge compensation .",
    "the main center consists of two re@xmath8 ions placed in the chain on each side of an adjacent cadmium vacancy , [ re@xmath8cd@xmath14 vacancy ",
    "re@xmath1 ] @xcite .",
    "both re@xmath8 ions in such a center are equivalent , their positional symmetry lowers from @xmath15 to @xmath17 .",
    "spectra of many other centers with different configurations were reported in epr and optical studies of cscdbr@xmath2:re crystals .",
    "in particular , positional symmetry for re@xmath8 ions in minor axial centers which are supposed to appear at higher re concentrations , namely , [ re@xmath8re@xmath8cd@xmath18 vacancy ] or [ re@xmath8 cd@xmath14 vacancy  cd@xmath14re@xmath8 ] , is again @xmath17 but two re@xmath8 positions are not equivalent , while in [ re@xmath8cs@xmath20 vacancy ] centers positional symmetry of re@xmath8 ion is @xmath21 .",
    "though the spectra of cscdbr@xmath2:pr@xmath8 were intensively studied before @xcite , crystal field energies of the lowest excited multiplets were not investigated in absorption .",
    "the positions of crystal field levels for the main center , as reported by different authors , differ by 214  @xmath22 .",
    "typical spectral resolution used in the mentioned works was 0.82  @xmath22 , while the only high resolution study ( it concerned the @xmath23 level ) revealed spectral lines as narrow as 0.1  @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "peculiar doublet line shape was observed for the @xmath24 transition and explained by the combined effect of unresolved hyperfine structure and non - axial crystal strains @xcite .",
    "the very first analysis of the crystal field energies of pr@xmath8 in cscdbr@xmath2 @xcite showed that the crystal field affecting the symmetric dimer centers consists of a strong cubic and a weak trigonal components and that the last one is determined mainly by the quadrupolar ( b@xmath25 ) term .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed in the studies of the crystal field energies of tm@xmath26 and ho@xmath8 symmetric pair centers where data obtained from both optical and submillimeter epr investigations were taken into account @xcite .",

    "@xcite from the fitting of the simulated energy level schemes to the measured 40 energy levels of pr@xmath8 are close to one another and provide small enough root - mean square deviations ( 22.411.1  @xmath22 ) between calculated and observed energy level data .",
    "however , some of the crystal field parameters in cscdbr@xmath2:re@xmath8 presented in the literature @xcite , in particular b@xmath27 and b@xmath28 , vary nonmonotonically with the occupation number of the 4@xmath29 electron shell .",
    "we have undertaken the low temperature high resolution infrared absorption study of cscdbr@xmath2:pr@xmath8 with the aims ( i ) to determine directly positions of crystal field levels in the region between 2000 and 7000 @xmath3 and ( ii ) to study the line widths and shapes and thus to obtain information on relaxation processes and hyperfine interactions .",
    "we also performed crystal field calculations for the main center in the framework of the semiphenomenological exchange charge model ( ecm ) @xcite , based on the analysis of the local lattice structure .",
    "parameters of the ecm were corrected by fitting the calculated hyperfine splittings of crystal field levels to the experimental data from our measurements .",

    "cscdbr@xmath2 crystals containing 0.2@xmath0 of pr@xmath8 were grown by the method described in ref .",
    "crystals easily cleave along the @xmath13 -axis .",
    "we have prepared a 1.3  mm thick sample ( sample a ) with the @xmath13-axis parallel to the cleaved face .",
    "the sample was upheld at a controlled temperature of 5  k in a helium vapor cryostat .",
    "unpolarized absorption spectra were measured with a bomem da3.002 fourier transform spectrometer in the spectral range between 2000 and 7000  @xmath22 with a resolution from 1.0 to 0.05  @xmath22 . in fourier",

    "precision of the experimental line positions was 0.050.3  @xmath22 , depending on a particular line .",
    "precise absolute wave number scale is an intrinsic property of fourier transform spectroscopy .",
    "line widths were determined from absorbance spectra calculated with a zero - line taken at a half of transmitted intensity . in such a way we tried to take into consideration the fact that the incident light is unpolarized but a majority of lines is 100@xmath0 polarized .",
    "the lowest frequency region of the @xmath37 spectral transition has also been measured with the resolution of 0.005  @xmath22 using another sample , 3.1  mm thick and oriented approximately along the @xmath13-axis ( sample b ) .",

    "1 shows low temperature transmittance spectra of cscdbr@xmath2:pr@xmath8 ( 0.2@xmath0 ) corresponding to different infrared transitions .",
    "the first excited state of the ground multiplet @xmath5 lies at about 170  @xmath22 @xcite and is not populated at helium temperatures .",
    "so , low temperature absorption spectra display crystal field levels of the excited multiplets directly .",
    "they are listed in table  1 , together with data from other publications .    as the ground state is the @xmath5(@xmath40 ) singlet , excited @xmath41 states manifest themselves in @xmath42-polarization but @xmath43 states   in @xmath44-polarization , while @xmath45 states are silent in electric dipole approximation ( see table  2 ) .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions are usually very weak , with a possible exception for the @xmath46 transition that is allowed for the free pr@xmath8 ion .",
    "the symmetries of the @xmath7 crystal field levels have been determined from a comparison between the spectra of the two differently oriented samples ( samples a and b ) .",
    "the assignement of the 6483.3  @xmath22 level as a @xmath43 level is strongly supported by the well resolved hyperfine structure ( hfs ) observed in high resolution spectra ( see inset  1 of fig .",
    "1d and fig .",
    "the point is that while @xmath43 levels exhibit the magnetic hfs , @xmath47 and @xmath45 do not .",
    "the next @xmath43 level also shows the traces of unresolved hfs , namely , the 6503.5  @xmath22 line has a flat bottom ( see inset  2 of fig .",
    "expansion of the 6483.3  @xmath22 line into six components yields 0.040  @xmath22 wide gaussians .",
    "the gaussian shape of hfs components gives evidence that an inhomogeneous broadening due to random crystal fields exceeds a homogeneous broadening due to nonradiative transitions to the nearest @xmath48 level lying at about 10  @xmath22 lower @xcite ( we did not observe @xmath49 ) transitions forbidden as electric dipole ones ) .",
    "the lineshapes of the 6496.5  @xmath22 ( @xmath50 ) and 6503.5  @xmath22 ( @xmath51 ) lines reveal homogeneous broadening of 0.17 and 0.31  @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "such a broadening comes , evidently , from electron - phonon interaction and implies a noticeable density of phonon states in the region between 20 and 30  @xmath22 corresponding to the distances from the considered levels to lower crystal field levels .",
    "other examples of level broadening due to electron - phonon interaction can be found in the @xmath4 multiplet which is situated in the region of about 2400  @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "the lowest level of this multiplet lying at about 2234  @xmath22 was reported to be the @xmath48 level , from polarized fluorescence measurements @xcite . in that case , a strong very narrow ( with the width of 0.05  @xmath22 ) line observed at 2234.8  @xmath22 corresponds to the magnetic dipole transition @xmath52 . as we have already mentioned , such a situation is possible just for the @xmath53 spectral multiplet .",
    "the next level lies at 26  @xmath22 from the bottom of the multiplet and , though suffers from a phonon relaxation , exhibits hfs as it follows from the shape of 2261.4  @xmath22 line .",
    "this is in accordance with the previously made assignments of this level symmetry as @xmath43 .",
    "three closely spaced levels at 2316.6 , 2331.9 and 2347.8  @xmath22 are broad .",
    "their widths are 3.0 , 3.3 and 3.7  @xmath22 respectively , and it is not possible to determine their symmetries .",
    "calculations described below show that an overall hyperfine splittings of @xmath43 levels do not exceed 0.5  @xmath22 . consequently , the level widths of 34  @xmath22 are , mainly , due to rapid phonon - assisted decay to lower levels . in accordance with the crystal field calculations ( see below ) , at least one of these three broad absorption lines is to be assigned to another center .",
    "the next level is more narrow again .",
    "according to the shape of the line at 2546.7  @xmath22 it contains unresolved hfs and thus corresponds to the @xmath43 level .",
    "the distances from this level to lower levels exceed the length of the phonon spectrum ( @xmath54 180  @xmath22 @xcite ) . because of",
    "that , one - phonon relaxation is not possible .",
    "the highest frequency line observed at 2572.1  @xmath22 could be attributed to the @xmath55 magnetic dipole transition .",
    "but the @xmath56 level lying at 26 @xmath22 above the @xmath57 level ( 2546  @xmath22 ) should be broadened due to one- and two - phonon transitions to the lower crystal field sublevels , and the width of the respective spectral line should be about 0.30.5  @xmath22 ( see table  3 ) , not 0.05  @xmath22 as observed .",
    "probably , this line belongs to some other pr@xmath8 center .",
    "weak narrow lines observed at 2153.6 and 2167.3  @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) also have to be assigned to some other centers .",
    "if these levels belonged to the main center , the level at 2234.8  @xmath22 would be broadened by the nonradiative transitions to these levels .",
    "it is not the case experimentally .",
    "we were able to find only two levels in the @xmath6 multiplet and the lowest sublevel in each of @xmath58 and @xmath32 .",
    "the level at 5073  @xmath22 which lies far ( 250  @xmath22 ) from a lower level is , evidently , broadened by unresolved hfs and is thus a @xmath43 level .",
    "the measured hyperfine splittings and widths of hyperfine sublevels found from the experimental line shapes are presented in table  3 , to compare with the calculated hyperfine splittings and the estimated one - phonon decay rates ( see the next section ) .",
    "many of the observed levels coincide with those of refs .",
    "@xcite found from selectively excited fluorescence measurements .",
    "we did not observe any additional structure due to nonequivalence of pr@xmath8 positions in asymmetric pair centers .",
    "thus , our results support the conclusion of refs .",

    "it should be noted that the measured width of the doublet @xmath165 is five times larger than the estimated total hfs width , though the one - phonon relaxation broadening of this level is not possible at low temperatures .",
    "we suppose that this level , and two upper levels @xmath166 @xmath167 are essentially broadened due to the two - phonon relaxation .",
    "the probability of the spontaneous emission of two phonons contains three terms which correspond to the first order contribution from the nonlinear electron - phonon interaction : @xmath168 to the second order contribution from the linear electron - phonon interaction : @xmath169 where @xmath170 and to the combined action of the first and second order transition amplitudes : @xmath171    the calculated sum of two - phonon relaxation rates @xmath172 corresponding to spontaneous transitions from the doublet @xmath173 to all lower sublevels of the @xmath4 multiplet , induced by the nonlinear terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) equals @xmath174  s@xmath175 and is almost exactly cancelled by the contribution @xmath176  s@xmath175 from  crossed ",
    "terms of eqn .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "we have obtained the remarkably larger contribution to the inverse lifetime of this doublet ( @xmath177  s@xmath175 ) , that agrees satisfactorily with its measured linewidth , from the second order terms given in eqn .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that relaxation processes that involve excitations of localized modes of @xmath158 and @xmath157 symmetry dominate yielding more than a half of the total relaxation rate .",
    "high resolution ( 10.005  @xmath22 ) infrared ( 20007000  @xmath22 ) absorption spectra of cscdbr@xmath2:pr@xmath8 ( 0.2@xmath0 ) were taken at low temperatures .",
    "crystal field levels of the @xmath4 , @xmath32 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 multiplets for the symmetric pair center [ pr@xmath8cd@xmath18 vacancy  pr@xmath8 ] were found directly in absorption .",
    "hyperfine structure , inhomogeneous and relaxation - induced widths of several crystal field levels were measured .",
    "we performed crystal field calculations in the framework of the semiphenomenological exchange charge model and took into account local lattice deformation around an impurity center .",
    "only two parameters of the model had to be determined by a comparison of calculated and experimental energy levels . thus obtained crystal field parameters were corrected by fitting the calculated hyperfine structure to the measured one .",
    "it follows from our results that despite a large trigonal distortion of the bromine octahedra in the nearest surroundings of impurity pr@xmath8 ions , crystal field splittings are determined , mainly , by the cubic component of the crystal field .    using the results of the crystal field calculations and of the lattice dynamics analysis we were able , for the first time , to calculate exactly ( without any additional fitting parameters ) one- and two - phonon spontaneous relaxation rates .",
    "the calculated total relaxation rates reveal the linewidths which are in reasonable agreement with the measured ones .",
    "the obtained information on relative efficiency of linear and nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian of the electron - phonon interaction in stimulation of the phonon emission is important for the thorough derivation of the theory of multiphonon relaxation in rare - earth compounds .",
    "the peculiarities of the electron - phonon interaction effects in cscdbr@xmath2:pr@xmath8 crystals originate from the specific density of phonon states that extends by only @xmath178  @xmath22 in the perfect cscdbr@xmath2 lattice , and from the localized modes induced by the impurity dimer centers .",
    "another important feature and , probably , the most interesting result of this study , is a strong suppression of the effective electron - phonon coupling due to a local increase of elastic forces in the activated crystal and the corresponding enhancement of correlations between displacements of the impurity re ion and its neighbors .",
