    "it is now widely accepted that agn derive their extraordinary luminosities ( sometimes more than @xmath2 times higher than luminosities of `` ordinary '' galaxies ) from energy release by matter accreting towards , and falling into , a central supermassive bh .",
    "the accretion disks around the central bh represent an efficient mechanism for extracting gravitational potential energy and converting it into radiation , giving us the most probable explanation for the main characteristics of agn ( high luminosity , compactness , jet formation , rapid time variation in radiation and the profile of the fe k@xmath1 spectral line ) . thus , agn are powerful sources of radiation in a wide spectral range : from @xmath3 rays to radio waves @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the x - ray radiation of agn ( which is generated in the innermost region around a central bh ) is a broad emission line fe k@xmath1 at 6.4 kev that may have an asymmetric profile ( narrow bright blue peak and wide faint red peak ) .",
    "it was discovered in seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite and later on observed in a number of agn . in some cases the line width corresponds to one third of speed of light , indicating that its emitters rotate with relativistic velocities .",
    "therefore , the line is probably produced in a very compact region near the central bh of agn and can provide us some essential information about the plasma conditions and the space - time geometry in vicinity of the bh @xcite .",
    "black holes have only three measurable parameters ( not including the hawking temperature ) : charge , mass and angular momentum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will pay attention mostly to angular momentum or spin of central supermassive bh of agn , which is a property of the space - time metric .",

    "an accretion disk could have different forms , dimensions and emissivity , depending on the type of its central bh , whether it is rotating ( kerr metric ) or nonrotating ( schwarzschild metric ) .",
    "we modeled emission of an accretion disk around supermassive bh using numerical simulations based on a ray - tracing method in a kerr metric , taking into account only photon trajectories reaching the observer s sky plane in the infinity @xcite . using this method we are able to obtain colorful images of accretion disk as would be seen by a distant observer with powerful high - resolution telescope ( see left panels of figs . [ fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] ) . from such disk images",
    "we then calculate total observed flux @xmath17 according to the following expression : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the disk emissivity , @xmath20 is the line transition energy ( @xmath21 kev ) , @xmath22 is the energy shift due to relativistic effects ( @xmath23 is the observed energy and @xmath24 is the emitted energy from the disk ) and @xmath25 is solid angle subtended by the accretion disk on observer s sky . the modeled line profile is then obtained by binning the flux into the energy shift ( @xmath26 ) axis ( see right panels of figs . [ fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the iron k@xmath1 line shape strongly depends on emissivity law of the disk @xmath19 , so we assume the standard shakura - sunyaev disk model @xcite , where accretion occurs via an optically thick and geometrically thin disk .",
    "the effects of strong gravitational field on the fe k@xmath1 line profile have been investigated in order to compare the modeled and observed line profiles . to obtain modeled line profiles ,",
    "it is necessary to define a number of parameters which describe the line emitting region in the disk , such as constraints for its size , the disk inclination angle , the mass of the central bh and its angular momentum . for the disk inclination we adopted the averaged value from the study of the fe k@xmath1 line profiles of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies : @xmath5 ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". the inner radius @xmath27 of the disk can not be smaller than the radius of the marginally stable orbit @xmath28 , that corresponds to @xmath29 ( gravitational radius @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is gravitational constant , @xmath32 is the mass of central bh , and @xmath33 is the velocity of light ) in the schwarzschild metric and to @xmath34 in the case of the kerr metric with angular momentum parameter @xmath4 . to select the outer radius @xmath35 of the disk ,",
    "we take into account some recent investigations of the fe k@xmath1 line profile showing that it should be emitted from the innermost part of the disk which outer radius is within several tens of r@xmath36 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to study observational effects of strong gravity in vicinity of supermassive bh in the center of agn , we analyzed three cases for the fe k@xmath1 line emitting region : ( i ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 r@xmath8 and @xmath5 ( in both schwarzschild and kerr metric ) , ( ii ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 r@xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in both schwarzschild and kerr metric ) and ( iii ) @xmath9 and the line emitting region in kerr metric with @xmath4 is in form of narrow annulus with width @xmath10 , located between : ( iiia ) @xmath11 r@xmath8 and @xmath12 r@xmath8 , ( iiib ) @xmath13 r@xmath8 and @xmath14 r@xmath8 and ( iiic ) @xmath15 r@xmath8 and @xmath16 r@xmath8 .",
    "illustrations of an accretion disk and the corresponding fe k@xmath1 line shapes in the first case for schwarzschild and kerr metric are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the red peak of the fe k@xmath1 line is brighter in case of almost maximally rotating bh , but at the same time it is also more embedded into the blue peak wing and therefore less separable from it . consequently , angular momentum of the central bh has significant influence on the line shape which supports assumption that the line originates from the innermost part of accretion disk , close to the central bh .",
    "this fact can be used for estimation of angular momentum of central bh in observed agn ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] contains illustrations of the line emitting regions and the corresponding line shapes in the case of highly inclined disk ( @xmath9 ) . here",
    ", the line profiles are broader than in the first case , mostly due to higher inclination . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in case of kerr metric , the red peak of the line is again more embedded into its blue peak wing ( as in the first case ) and it confirms that this effect can be most likely attributed to angular momentum .",
    "results for the third analyzed case are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from this figure",
    "one can see how the fe k@xmath1 line profile is changing as the function of distance from central bh . when the line emitters are located at the lower radii of the disk , i.e. closer to the central bh , the lines are broader and the line profiles are more asymmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if the line emission is originating at larger distances from the bh , the red peak of the line becomes brighter and line profile narrower and more symmetric . in majority of agn , where the broad fe k@xmath1 line is observed line is observed , but it is supposed to be emitted in the disk corona that is located farther from the disk , and therefore , these relativistic effects can not be detected in the line profile ] , its profile is more similar to the modeled profile as obtained under assumption that the line emitters are located close to the central bh .",
    "therefore , comparisons between the observed and modeled fe k@xmath1 line profiles can bring us some essential information about strong gravitational field in vicinity of central supermassive bh of agn .",
    "we performed numerical simulations based on a ray - tracing method in a kerr metric in order to model the emission of accretion disk around supermassive bh of agn .",
    "we also simulated the influence of a strong gravitational field on the fe k@xmath1 line , showing that these effects can be detected in the observed line shapes .",
    "according to the obtained results , angular momentum or spin of central supermassive bh of agn has significant influence on the line profile .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the high resolution observations of the fe k@xmath1 line could be used for determination of the space - time geometry ( metric ) in vicinity of the supermassive bh , supposed to be in heart of agn .",
