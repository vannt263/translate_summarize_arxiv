    "the hadron production mechanism in particles collisions is one of the important subjects in the study of strong interaction .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is considered as the theory of strong interaction . however , the hadronization processes belong to nonperturbative problem for which no practicable calculation based on the first principle available . some phenomenological hadronization models were thus built up , which play important roles in the studies toward the final understanding of strong interaction .",
    "the famous lund string fragmentation model is one of the successful hadronization schemes , which contains several nontrivial dynamical features and describes the general semi - classical picture of hadron production . at high energies , the lund generator , jetset ,",
    "can simulate the processes of hadron production via single photon annihilation and predicts the many properties of the final states correctly .",
    "but the application of lund model at intermediate energies has been blank .",
    "a direct way out of this situation is to start from the basic assumptions of lund model and find the solutions of the area law without adopting any high - energy approximation .",
    "based on the lund area law , a new generator luarlw was compiled , which agrees with bes data between @xmath1 gev well ( see figure [ fig2200 ] on page ) .",
    "the foundations of lund model ( relativity , causality and quantum mechanics ) are universal .",
    "the basic hadron production picture is string fragmentation . the produced new pairs @xmath2 and @xmath3 may form mesons and baryons if they carry with the correct flavor quantum numbers , otherwise they just behave like the vacuum fluctuations and do not lead any observable effects in experiments ( see figure [ haiming : breakup ] ) .     and @xmath3 production , hadrons form at vertices[haiming : breakup ] ]    using the assumptions of very high energy approximation ( the remaining string always has large energy scale ) , left ",

    ", the mass - shell conditions should be the component part of the fragmentation dynamics , and the string usually fragments into @xmath12 hadrons .",
    "therefore the string fragmentation have to be treated as exclusive one instead of inclusive like in jetset .",
    "lund string fragmentation process is lorentz invariant and factorizable .",
    "the finite energy ( @xmath13 ) system containing @xmath14 hadrons may be viewed as a cluster of infinite string fragmentation system with energy ( @xmath15 ) ( see figure [ cluster ] ) . according to the general properties of iterative cascade ,",
