    "the vast majority of the galaxy s globular clusters ( gcs ) have apparent half - mass two - body relaxation times much shorter than their respective ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) . in these clusters , at least in their centers where the density is highest , two - body relaxation has shaped the distribution of stars : in two - body encounters , massive stars tend to lose kinetic energy to lower - mass stars and , as a result , massive stars sink into the cluster s center , whereas low - mass stars gain energy allowing them to populate orbits further away from the cluster s center .",
    "this is observed as mass segregation , i.e. more massive stars show a more concentrated radial distribution than lower - mass stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass function of the cluster becomes shallower in the cluster center but also globally , as stars at large radii are more easily lost to the galactic potential @xcite and the cluster s mass - to - light ratio decreases .",
    "however , in a few gcs , such as the massive clusters ngc2419 and ngc5139 ( @xmath6cen ) and several low - mass , but extended , outer halo clusters , the dynamical half - mass relaxation time @xmath7 is comparable to or even exceeds the hubble time . the mass segregation time - scale for a star of mass @xmath8 is given @xmath9 @xcite , where the average stellar mass @xmath10 in gcs is @xmath11",
    ". therefore dynamical effects like low - mass star depletion or mass segregation should not have affected the ( luminous ) main - sequence stars ( @xmath12 ) in these clusters much , assuming that the cluster parameters such as half - mass radii and cluster masses have not changed dramatically within the last few gyr and hence that their present - day two - body relaxation times are a representative measure of the relaxation time - scale for their entire lifetime .",
    "one of these clusters is palomar14 ( pal14 ; also known as avdb after its discoverers * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently reported that the distribution of blue straggler stars in pal14 is not centrally concentrated with respect to less massive hb and rgb stars in this cluster .",
    "blue stragglers ( bs ) are hydrogen - burning stars that are brighter and bluer than the main - sequence turn - off of their host population and are believed to form either through direct collisions @xcite or through mass - transfer in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the radial distributions of bs in massive globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the detection of two distinct sequences of bs in m30 @xcite suggests that both mechanisms are at work in dense gcs . in a diffuse cluster like pal14 ,",
    "the low stellar density and therefore low probability of collisions makes it likely that bs are primarily due to mass - transfer in primordial binary systems .",
    "regardless of the formation channel , the masses of bs , or at least the total masses of their progenitor binary systems , likely exceed those of any other single star that can be identified in a cluster s color - magnitude diagram ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the distribution of bs with respect to lower - mass tracers is widely used as an indicator for mass segregation and the state of dynamical evolution of gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "accordingly , @xcite interpreted their finding as proof that two - body relaxation has not yet affected pal14 , not even in its center , and that the cluster is not mass - segregated , in agreement with the expectation from its long present - day half - mass relaxation time of @xmath13gyr @xcite .",
    "pal14 s dynamical state has recently also received considerable attention in the context of testing modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cluster s large galactocentric distance of @xmath1466kpc @xcite in combination with its low mass and density , and therefore the low external and internal acceleration experienced by its stars , make it an excellent test case for this theory . in this context , @xcite measured radial velocities of 16 cluster members and found a good agreement between the cluster s photometric and dynamical mass in classical newtonian dynamics .",
    "their measured velocity dispersion is significantly lower than predicted in mond @xcite , although mond can not be ruled out from these data .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the @xcite radial velocities including a heuristic treatment of binaries and mass segregation , and argued that pal14 has to have a very low binary fraction in order to be compatible with the low observed velocity dispersion . in a monte - carlo analysis of the data that included the effects of binaries , of the external field and of velocity anisotropy , @xcite found that the cluster is compatible with newtonian dynamics also when the constraint of the binary fraction is relaxed to @xmath15 per cent .",
    "tidal tails around the cluster , first detected at low significance in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data by and confirmed in deeper wide - field imaging by @xcite may further complicate the interpretation of the small sample of radial velocities as unbound stars may contaminate the sample ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "pal14 was also the subject of the first full collisional @xmath16-body simulations of a gc over its entire lifetime by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that , while two - body relaxation does have an effect on the cluster s stellar mass function , the effect from two - body relaxation is too weak such that the shallow present - day mass function slope corresponds to negative power - law exponent , i.e. the @xcite imf has a slope of @xmath17 .",
    "] of @xmath18 measured by @xcite can not be reproduced with models starting with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the observations can , in principle , be reproduced by models with primordial mass segregation , but that the necessary degree of mass segregation has to be very high .",
    "alternatively , they argued that the cluster must have lost a good fraction of its low mass stars in the early gas - expulsion phase , referring to an effect studied by @xcite .",
    "however , also this latter scenario would require that the cluster must have formed with a high degree of primordial mass segregation .",
    "hence , in any case pal14 should be mass - segregated nowadays , since otherwise the observational evidence for a flattened present - day mass function of this cluster is at odds with our current understanding of stellar dynamics or with the assumption of a universal imf .    in this contribution ,",
    "we use archival hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) data reaching down to @xmath19mag below the main - sequence turn - off to test whether the cluster is mass - segregated in order to shed light on its dynamical state .",

    "similarly , using collisional @xmath16-body simulations to study pal14 , @xcite have shown that two - body relaxation alone is insufficient in order to deplete the mass function of low - mass stars and hence to establish the observed mass segregation , if the cluster was born with an initial half - mass radius similar to its present - day value and with a kroupa imf . on the other hand , they found that a cluster born initially significantly more compact will not evolve to the present extended shape of pal14 .",

    "pal14 has a current galactocentric distance 3.5 times as large , but its orbit is unknown .    in order for disk shocks to become important , a cluster has to cross the galactic disk within a galactocentric radius of about 8 kpc , since disk shocks will be considerably weaker for a cluster crossing the outer disk where the stellar density is much lower @xcite .",
    "in addition , disk crossings will occur less frequently for a cluster on a nearly circular orbit at the galactocentric distance of pal14 .",

    "in fact , assuming that its current distance of 66 kpc is close to its apogalactic radius , @xmath161 , pal14 would have to be on a highly eccentric orbit with @xmath162 in order to have a perigalactic radius , @xmath163 , below 8 kpc .",
    "such high eccentricities would imply severe tidal shocking during pericentre passages , being much more hazardous to the cluster than the disk shocks .",
    "such tidal shocks could in fact temporarily unbind large parts of a cluster like pal14 , since its jacobi radius could be significantly smaller than the size of the cluster during a pericentre passage .",
    "while moving towards apogalacticon the jacobi radius of the cluster would grow again and re - capture large parts of the temporarily unbound material @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the half - light radius of pal14 is significantly overestimated due to unbound stars . in @xmath16-body simulations of gcs on eccentric orbits in external tidal fields",

    "therefore the distribution of stars attributed to pal14 could already be dominated by unbound stars at radii smaller than @xmath165pc , and the half - light radius of the bound body of pal14 may be significantly smaller than the estimated half - light radius of 46pc .",
    "in this case , the mystery how the diffuse cluster has survived to the present day has a simple solution : the cluster has _ not _ survived , and what we observe is an already largely disintegrated stellar system .",

    "the apparent conflict in clusters like pal14 and arp2 between a non - concentrated population of bs and a ms population that shows mass segregation may be due to the different time - scales traced by the sinking - in of bs and the depletion of ms stars in the center .",

    "indeed , simulations of pal4 @xcite show that on a time - scale of 11gyr , which is of the same order of magnitude as pal4 s half - mass relaxation time , two - body relaxation processes are sufficient to establish an observable degree of mass segregation among main sequence stars in the mass range @xmath167  even in gcs , which have low masses and large half - light radii at the present day . in the framework of @xcite , who classify galactic gcs into three stages of dynamical evolution based on the radial distribution of bs , pal14 , together with @xmath6cen and ngc2419",
    "comprises the dynamically unevolved ` family 1 ' of gcs .",
    "since in contrast to @xmath6cen and ngc2419 , pal14 is already depleted of low - mass stars in the center , in this picture , pal14 might be on the verge of transitioning towards the dynamically intermediate ` family 2 ' .",
    "finally , we note that in the competitive accretion scenario that was mentioned above in the context of primordial mass segregation , it is also conceivable that stars are generally segregated by mass , but that the distribution of binaries ( such as the bs progenitors ) is not necessarily more centrally concentrated , although to our knowledge this has not been studied theoretically yet .",
    "using archival _ hst _ data we showed that the main - sequence stars of pal14 clearly indicate mass segregation in the sense that the cluster is significantly depleted in low - mass stars in its core with respect to larger radii .",
    "the radial dependence of the stellar mass function in pal14 was measured using deep archival @xmath2 and @xmath20-band imaging obtained with the _ hst_/wfpc2 .",
    "we find that in the stellar mass range @xmath168 the stellar mass function is described by a shallow power - law slope of @xmath169 in the cluster s core , while at larger radii the present - day mass function with a slope of @xmath170 is still below a kroupa imf in this mass range ( @xmath30=2.3 ) .    in order for mass segregation in pal14 and its overall mass function being depleted of low - mass stars to be the result of two - body relaxation processes",
    ", pal14 must have been significantly more compact in the past , since its present - day half - mass two - body relaxation time is of the order of 20  gyr .",
    "the expansion of more than a factor of 2 in size may have been caused by severe tidal shocks during pericentre passages on a very eccentric cluster orbit about the milky way , as it has been similarly suggested for palomar 5 with disk shocks @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the cluster might have been given this extended shape by the gas expulsion process at birth which might also be the origin of the depleted mass function @xcite .",
    "for such an extended cluster to have survived to the present day , this birth process is likely to have happened in a very remote environment , far away from the destructive tidal forces of the milky way .",
    "hence , pal14 could either be an initially compact native milky way cluster on a very eccentric orbit , or be a recently accreted globular cluster which formed with primordial mass segregation far away from the galaxy .",
    "in any case , due to the mass segregation the tidal tails of pal14 should show a mass function enriched in low - mass stars , so that mapping their full extent will require deep imaging reaching well below the cluster s main - sequence turn - off point .",
