    "the dynamics of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum antiferromagnetic systems with long - ranged order at low temperature can be considered as that of a dilute gas of weakly interacting spin - wave quasiparticles ( magnons ) with its density given by the quantum correction to the classical nel order @xcite .",
    "these magons are transverse modes with spin @xmath4 . the longitudinal fluctuations with spin @xmath5 present in these systems consist of the multi - magnon continuum @xcite .",
    "the question concerning long - lived , well - defined longitudinal modes in quantum antiferromagnetic systems with long - ranged order remains open .",
    "this is our main focus in this paper .    in case of the quantum antiferromagnetic systems without long - ranged order ,",
    "the triplet excitation states ( two transverse and one longitudinal ) of the spin-1 heisenberg chain with non - zero gap , first predicted by haldane @xcite , are well known .",
    "this theoretical prediction of an energy gap separating the singlet ground state from the triplet excitation states has been confirmed experimentally in the quasi-1d antiferromagnetic compounds such as csnicl@xmath3 and rbnicl@xmath3 of the spin-@xmath6 @xcite . some subsequent experimental investigations @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite also support haldane s conjecture . in these experiments ,",
    "the temperature is high enough so the quasi-1d systems have no long - ranged magnetic order and the dynamics can be described by the 1d models . at lower temperatures ,",
    "these quasi-1d antiferromagnets behave as 3d systems with long - ranged magnetic orders .",
    "the key question is whether or not the longitudinal modes survive in present of the long - ranged order and , if the answer is yes , how we describe them in general terms . in this regard ,",
    "the observation of an energy gap for the quasi-1d compound csnicl@xmath7 at low temperature in 1986 generated much theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "this energy gap was initially explained by a uniaxial single - ion anisotropy but now it is widely accepted that the gapped excited state belongs to longitudinal excitation modes , first proposed by affleck [ in the quasi-1d hexagonal antiferromagnetic compounds of the @xmath8-type with both spin quantum number @xmath9 csnicl@xmath7 and rbnicl@xmath7 @xcite . a field theory approach focusing on the spin frustrations of the hexagonal antiferromagnetic systems has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "clearly , such longitudinal modes are beyond the usual spin - wave theory ( swt ) which only predicts the transverse spin - wave excitations ( magnons ) .",
    "there have been several theoretical investigations in these longitudinal modes , all using the field theory approach , such as the sine - gordon theory for the spin-1/2 systems in bipartite quasi-1d antiferromagnetic systems treating the inter - chain couplings as perturbation @xcite . the theoretical estimate for the energy gap of",
    "the longitudinal mode is in good agreement with the experimental results for the compound kcuf@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "more recently , a longitudinal mode was also observed in the dimerized antiferromagnetic compound tlcucl@xmath7 under pressure with a long - range nel order @xcite and tetrahedral spin system cu@xmath10te@xmath10o@xmath11br@xmath10 using raman scattering @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no observation of longitudinal modes in 2d or quasi-2d antiferromagnets has been reported yet .",
    "our theoretical investigation of the longitudinal modes in quantum antiferromagnets is based on a microscopic theory for a generic spin-@xmath0 hamiltonian system @xcite .",
    "we identify the longitudinal excitation states in a quantum antiferromagnet with a nel - like order as the collective modes of the magnon - density waves , which represent the fluctuations in the magnitude of the long - range order and are supported by the interactions between magnons .",
    "the basic idea in our analysis is similar to feynmann s theory on the low - lying excited states of the helium-4 superfluid @xcite , thereby employing the magnon - density operator @xmath12 for the antiferromagnets in place of the particle density operator for the helium-4 superfluid .",
    "hence , the longitudinal excitation states in antiferromagnets are constructed by the @xmath12 spin operators , contrast to the transverse spin operators @xmath13 of the magnon states in anderson s swt @xcite .",
    "our preliminary calculation for the two dimensional triangular model @xcite have been extended to the quasi-1d hexagonal structures of csnicl@xmath3 and rbnicl@xmath3 , where we find that our numerical results for the energy gap values at the magnetic wavevector are in good agreement with experimental results after inclusion of the high - order contributions in the large-@xmath0 expansion @xcite . in this article , we extend similar high - order calculations to the bipartite antiferromagnetic systems where the long - ranged order is collinear @xcite .",

    "v focuses on the tetragonal quasi-1d compound kcuf@xmath3 with spin-1/2 and we find that our estimate of the minimum energy gap for the longitudinal mode after inclusion of the high - order contributions is in good agreement with the experimental result . for completeness , in sec .",
    "vi we include our earlier analysis @xcite for the quasi-1d hexagonal systems where there are a number of experimental results for comparison . in sec .",
    "vii we conclude this article by a summary and a discussion of a possible longitudinal mode in a 2d square lattice model , relevant to the parent compound la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 of the high-@xmath16 superconductors .",
    "the longitudinal excitations in a quantum antiferromagnetic system with a nel - like long range order correspond to the fluctuations in the order parameter . since the quantum correction in the order parameter",
    "is given by the magnon density @xcite , we identify the longitudinal modes as the magnon - density waves ( mdw ) , supported by the interactions between the magnons .",
    "it is clear that the states of mdw may not be well defined in the high - order dimensional systems where the magnon density is very dilute and the long - range order is near the classical value with little quantum correction .",
    "however , the magnon density may be high enough in the low dimensional systems to support the longitudinal waves . in terms of microscopic many - body language ,",
    "the mdw states are constructed by applying the magnon density operator @xmath12 on the ground state in a form as @xmath17 , similar to feynmann s theory of the phonon - roton excitation state of the helium superfluid , where the density operator is the usual particle density operator @xcite .",
    "we consider a general spin-@xmath0 @xmath18 heisenberg model on a bipartite lattice with hamiltonian given by @xmath19,\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath20 indicates the nearest - neighbor couplings only and @xmath21 is the anisotropy parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the usual isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the classical ground state of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is given by the nel state with two alternating sublattices , one with all spin - up and the other with all spin - down .",
    "we leave the discussion of the hexagonal systems to sec .",
    "we perform spin rotation on the spin - up sublattice by @xmath24 so that all spins align in the same down direction .",
    "this is equivalent to the transformation @xmath25 for all sites of the spin - up sublattice .",
    "the hamiltonian   after this transformations is given as @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 runs through all @xmath28 sites , @xmath29 is the nearest neighbor index vector with coordination number @xmath30 and 6 for linear chain , square lattice and cubic lattice respectively .",
    "the quantum ground - state of the hamiltonian @xmath31 is different from the the classical nel state .",
    "this difference can be quantify by a correction in the sublattice magnetization @xmath32 as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 indicated the ground - state expectation , @xmath0 is the classical value , and @xmath35 is the quantum correction with the physical meaning of the magnon density .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath12 corresponds to the magnon - density operator , contrast to the spin - flip operators @xmath13 which creates or destroys magnons . in this article , we employ anderson s swt for our approximation of the ground state @xmath36 .",
    "anderson s swt can be most simply formulated by expressing @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all sites in terms of boson operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "for example , the linear swt by setting @xmath41 produces the values of @xmath42 per lattice site for the spin-1/2 isotropic heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice , and @xmath43 per lattice site for the same model but on a square lattice . for the same model on 1d",
    ", however , swt fails to produce the exact result of @xmath44 , which represents the maximum , saturated value of the magnon density .",
    "we consider the longitudinal modes of the quantum antiferromagnetic systems in terms of the fluctuations in these magnon densities as described below .    following feynman",
    "as mentioned earlier , the longitudinal excitation state is approximated by applying the magnon density fluctuation operator @xmath45 to the ground state @xmath36 as latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq5 }    by the fourier transformation of @xmath12 operators , @xmath47 with index @xmath27 running over all lattice sites .",

    "is hence obtained by evaluating the the double commutator and the structure factor of eqs .  - .",
    "we can compare the longitudinal spectrum @xmath74 with the transverse spin - wave spectrum given by @xmath75      the swt breaks down for the isotropic 1d case as most integrals involving the ground - state expectation diverge .",
    "for example , @xmath76 as @xmath77 in the linear swt .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the spin - wave spectrum of eq .   is doublet while the exact result by bethe ansatz @xcite is triplet for the spin-1/2 model . nevertheless , the value of eq .  , @xmath78 , is not far off the exact triplet spectrum derived as @xcite @xmath79    .",

    "therefore , the longitudinal excitation sectrum in the isotropic limit , @xmath82 , coincides precisely with spin - wave spectrum of eq .  .",
