    "an understanding of the star formation process requires an understanding of the underlying density distribution in star forming regions . in a direct sense ,",
    "knowledge of the density distribution can help distinguish between different potential dynamical scenarios for energy injection , collapse , fragmentation , and outflow . in a more indirect sense",
    ", the density distribution significantly affects our ability to infer source properties through its influence on thermal balance , chemistry , local emission , and the processing of radiation ( radiative transfer ) between the emitting region and the observer .",
    "the density distribution is important for the dust as well as the gas . in particular",
    ", the dust forms the dominant source of opacity to visible and infrared ( ir ) radiation , and is the dominant source of ir continuum radiation .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the dust dominates thermal balance by direct interaction with the radiation field ( van de hulst 1949 ) , and through collisions with the gas ( greenberg 1971 ; goldreich & kwan 1974 ) . as the problems of thermal balance and radiative transfer are non - local , non - linear feedback problems , comparison of detailed models with observations remain the best choice of reliably inferring the source properties .",
    "source geometry is a significant problem in modeling star - forming regions . while it is normal to assume some geometric symmetry , such restrictions are generally not realistic .",
    "in particular , a wealth of observations ( e.g. migenes et al . 1989 ; dickman et al . 1990 ; falgarone et al . 1991 ; cesaroni et al . 1991 ; marscher et al . 1993 ; zhou et al . 1994 ; plume et al . 1997 ; shepherd et al .",
    "1997 ) show that and fragmentation ( see also goldsmith 1996 ; tauber 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this is supported by dynamical models ( e.g. truelove et al .",
    "1998 ; marinho & lepine 2000 ; klapp & sigalotti 1998 ; klessen 1997 ) which naturally produce clumpy and fragmented structures .",
    "previous work on radiative transfer in dusty , clumpy environments has been undertaken ( e.g. hegmann & kegel 2003 ; witt & gordon 1996 ; varosi & dwek 1999 ; boiss 1990 ) .",
    "however , much of the previous work has concentrated on scattering ( e.g. with application to reflection nebulae ) , the detailed methods of solution , and/or some of the fundamental results such as ability of radiation to penetrate to apparently high optical depths . in this paper",
    "we use a 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer model to extend the previous work to a wider and different range of physical conditions . in particular , we construct a large grid of models in an effort to better delineate and understand the effects of clumpy media on radiative transfer . by controlling and varying the parameterization of the source , we attempt to disentangle some of the underlying physical causes of these effects .",
    "in section two we describe the model .",
    "we discuss the general effects of clumping in section three . in section four",
    ", we introduce the `` fraction of open sky '' ( fos ) , and discuss the effects of number density , fos , optical depth , filling factor , and clump size on the dust temperature distribution .",
    "we discuss the effects of shadowing in section five .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions in section six .",
    "we have constructed detailed , self - consistent , three - dimensional radiative transfer models through dust .",
    "the model utilizes a monte - carlo approach , combined with an approximate lambda iteration to ensure true convergence even at high optical depths .",
    "the model has been tested against existing 1-d ( egan , leung , & spagna 1988 ) and 2-d ( spagna , leung , & egan 1991 ) codes , and in modeling a 3-d source ( doty et al . 2005 ) with good success .",
    "since the present study concentrates upon opaque molecular clouds where far - infrared radiaton should dominate both for external heating and emission , we ignore the effects of scattering .",
    "test cases in both one- and multiple - dimensions show that scattering plays only a very small role on the temperature distribution within the majority of the sources .    based upon the input parameters discussed below , we solve for the dust temperature and radiation field at each point in the model cloud .",
    "the computational volume is taken to be cubical of size 1 pc .",
    "each model utilized an @xmath1 cell grid , yielding a typical resolution of @xmath2 cm .",
    "the region is taken to be a two - phase medium consisting of high density clumps , and a low density inter - clump medium .",
    "the clump / inter - clump density ratio is taken to be @xmath3 from observations ( e.g. bergin et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the external radiation field is taken from interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) compiled by mathis , mezger , & panagia ( 1983 ) .",
    "finally , we adopt the dust opacities in column 5 of table 1 of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) , which have been successful at fitting observations of both high - mass ( e.g. , van der tak et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) and low - mass ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2001 ) regions of star formation .",
    "we adopt a uniformly distributed interclump medium interspersed with higher density clumps having @xmath3 .",
    "the clumps are randomly distributed within the computational volume .",
    "the number of clumps , and the densities of the clumps and interclump medium depend upon the filling factor ( @xmath4 ) , the clump radius ( @xmath5 ) , and the face - averaged optical depth ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the filling factor specifies the fraction of the volume at high density .",
    "it is given by @xmath7 .",
    "we adopt filling factors of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in accord with observations ( e.g. snell et al .",
    "1984 ; bergin et al . 1996 ; carr 1987 ) .",
    "when all other parameters are kept fixed , a higher @xmath4 corresponds to a larger number of clumps , and a more nearly continuous dust distribution .",
    "furthermore , due to optical depth constraint ( see @xmath6 below ) , a larger @xmath4 also corresponds to clumps and interclump medium of lower density .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that all non - overlapping clumps are spheres of radius @xmath5 .",
    "we choose @xmath11 pc , @xmath12 pc , and @xmath9 pc in accord with observations ( e.g. carr 1987 ; howe et al .",
    "again , the constraint on the optical depth implies that larger clump radii yield smaller densities within the clumps .",
    "the dust number densities are normalized by averaging the optical depth over one entire ( @xmath13 ) face of the computational cube .",
    "we call this the face - averaged optical depth , and denote it by @xmath6 .",
    "this was done to simulate the optical depth / column density that might be inferred by a very large beam , although it has the same effect as normalizing to the total cloud mass .",
    "the face - averaged optical depth is taken to be @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , in keeping with observations from extinction studies ( lada , alves , & lada 1999 ) .    finally , the models are specified by the strength of the internal radiation field , specified by the luminosity of the central source , @xmath16 .",
    "we have constructed a grid having @xmath17l@xmath18 , @xmath19l@xmath18 , and @xmath20l@xmath18 to represent a starless core , a low - luminosity central object , and a high - luminosity central object , respectively . however , in this paper , we restrict our report to the starless cores only ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the others will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the ranges of parameters specified above led to a grid of 54 models .",
    "each model is numbered by a four - digit integer @xmath22 .",
    "the integers , and their corresponding values are given in table [ modelparameters ] for reference .",
    "as an example , model 1221 has @xmath21 , @xmath8 , @xmath23 pc , and @xmath24 .",
    ".model input parameters [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      +    third , the effect of filling factor varies inversely with clump radius .",
    "this is expected , as fos increases with increasing @xmath5 , and decreasing @xmath4 . to see this ,",
    "consider the simplifying case of viewing from the center of a sphere , in which spherical clumps of radius @xmath25 are randomly distributed a distance @xmath26 from the center , and in which no clumps overlap .",
    "this yields @xmath27 . for @xmath28 ,",
    "this yields fos @xmath29 for @xmath30 pc , @xmath31 for @xmath32 pc , and @xmath33 for @xmath11 pc . in reality",
    "fos is influenced by two further competing factors  clump overlap in projection ( increases fos ) , and clump distribution in distance ( decreases fos ) .",
    "the actual variation of fos with model parameters is given in fig .",
    "[ plotfos ] .",
    "the result roughly agrees with the estimate above .",
    "the lower trend of the actual results imply that clump overlap is not a significant effect .",
    "these results are somewhat different for models with high optical depth , @xmath34 .",
    "as confirmed in table [ tinovertout100 ] , the temperature distribution at these high optical depths depends significantly on @xmath4 , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "this independence of temperature on clump radius for large optical depths can can be easily understood by considering the optical depth of individual clumps for various models . for the isrf of mathis , mezger , and panagia ( 1983 ) ,",
    "roughly 1/2 of the total energy is contained in @xmath35 m , 2/3 in @xmath36 m , and 3/4 in @xmath37 m .",
    "the optical depths of a clump at these wavelengths for @xmath24 are , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . on the other hand , for @xmath41",
    "the optical depths are ten times higher , namely , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the clumps for @xmath24 are opaque to 1/2 of the heating radiation , but transparent to the remaining 1/2 .",
    "consequently , @xmath4 ( and fos ) can control roughly 1/2 of the heating radiation .",
    "however , for @xmath41 , the clumps are opaque to 2/3 - 3/4 of the heating radiation , meaning that @xmath4 ( and fos ) can control a greater amount of the energy that penetrates to a given depth . as a result",
    ", it is not suprising to realize that as the clumps become more opaque , filling factor and the ability of radiation to stream between the clumps becomes more important .",
    "figure [ lowf2t100 ] shows a representative variation in the spherical average temperature distribution with clump radius ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath45 and @xmath41 .",
    "again , the temperature distributions in the other models are qualitatively similar , and the temperature contrast results are shown in tables [ tinovertout10 ] & [ tinovertout100 ] .",
    "we see from these data that the role of clump radius varies with filling factor . in comparison to the case of filling factor ,",
    "the smallest clumps yield the lowest temperatures , and the largest clumps the highest temperatures , consistent with the fos findings in fig .",
    "[ plotfos ] .",
    "the independence of temperature with @xmath25 for @xmath8 is due to the large fos .",
    "in particular , there exists a large number of open lines of sight to any point , making clump variation unimportant .",
    "conversely , as @xmath4 increases , clump size becomes more important .",
    "this is due to the fact that high filling factor models have a commensurately greater number of small clumps . as discussed previously ,",
    "many small clumps are more effective at covering the sky than fewer large clumps ",
    "[ plotfos ] .",
    "consequently , clump radius is an important factor in determining the temperature profile for high filling factors .    as before ,",
    "the results differ for regions of higher optical depth , @xmath41 . in table",
    "[ tinovertout100 ] we can see the variation in the temperature contrast . as discussed previously , the increasing opacity of the clumps further amplifies the effect of filling factor and fos on the temperature distribution , leaving the effect of clump radius as unimportant .      by combining the results of the two previous subsections ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ plotfos ] and tables [ tinovertout10 ] & [ tinovertout100 ] ) , we can infer the regions of importance for filling factor and clump radius .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath24 . at these moderate optical depths",
    ", we see that clump radius only becomes important for @xmath46 . in the case of @xmath47 ,",
    "clump radius essentially plays no role and is dominated by the fact that the fos is always high for such small filling factors .    on the other hand",
    ", we see that filling factor only becomes important for @xmath48 pc . for @xmath49 pc ,",
    "the temperature is dominated by the fact that the fos is relatively insensitive to @xmath4 , due to the large number of holes left by scenarios with small numbers of large clumps .",
    "it is interesting that the inferred values of @xmath4 from observations routinely fall in the range of a few per cent ( e.g. hogerheijde , jansen , van dishoeck 1995 ; snell et al .",
    "1984 ; mundy et al . 1986",
    "; bergin 1996 ) .",
    "in light of the results above , this may not be a suprise . for smaller",
    "filling factors , @xmath4 and @xmath25 do not play a significant role in the temperature distribution . on the other hand , for larger filling factors , the cloud is closer to homogeneous , and more sensitive to clump radius than @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "the temperature distribution is most sensitive to changes in @xmath4 for @xmath50 .",
    "while many interpretations of filling factor are not driven by continuum observations , these results are relevant since one of the dominant thermal regulators for the gas is collisions with the dust  meaning that sensitivity to @xmath51 near @xmath50 can lead to sensitivity in line processes near @xmath50 .    as a test , we have run additional models @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for the model numbers 1x21 . in order to quantify the deviation from the homogenous model",
    ", we have calculated a parameter , @xmath54 . here",
    "the sum is over radial positions , @xmath55 is the spherical average temperature for the homogenous model , and @xmath56 is the uncertainty in the temperature distribution in the homogenous model . in fig .",
    "[ phi2 ] we plot the ratio of the @xmath57 to the maximum value , @xmath58 as a function of filling factor .",
    "notice that , indeed , the deviation from the homogeneous models peaks for intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the greatest sensitivity to @xmath4 occurs in the range @xmath59  a resultin accord with the ranges of filling factors commonly reported .    when the optical depth increases to @xmath41 , we find that filling factor plays the dominant role over a much wider range . as a result ,",
    "the sensitivity to filling factor near @xmath60 for @xmath24 is not an effect here . at high optical depth",
    ", we also find that the clump radius is not important .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath4 has a larger effect on fos than @xmath25 does , and that as optical depth increases , the clumps become more opaque , thereby blocking a higher fraction of the impinging radiation .      from the previous discussion ,",
    "fos is necessary to describe the local radiation field and heating within a clumpy medium . here",
    "we attempt to infer the strength of the effect of fos on temperature .",
    "while this has been addressed in passing , here we collect and further distill that information to help draw more general conclusions .    as seen in section 4.3.4 and fig .",
    "[ taufosnewsig ] , the greatest effect of @xmath61 is at large radii .",
    "we find that this is generally true across our grid of models .",
    "as expected , these points tend to have the highest fos .",
    "interestingly , however , the effect of fos is on the situations where the fos is relatively small .",
    "this can be inferred in three ways .",
    "first , we note that the largest values of @xmath61 occur for the models that have the lowest fos .",
    "this can be indirectly seen in that the models with the largest @xmath62 in table [ fostautable ] tend to have the larger filling factors . as seen in figs .",
    "[ plotfosplin ] & [ plotfos ] , higher @xmath4 corresponds to lower values of fos .",
    "we can roughly quantify this by saying that fos is important for those regions where fos @xmath63 or so . to begin to quantify this",
    "we can consider the temperature distributions and deviations in tables [ tinovertout10 ] & [ tinovertout100 ] , together with the fos values in fig .",
    "[ plotfos ] .",
    "in particular , we note that meaningful differences in spherical average temperature occur between all models at the smallest clump radius , that essentially no variation occurs with filling factor for the largest clump radius , and that meaningful variation may occur as one changes filling factor at the intermediate clump radius . from fig .",
    "[ plotfos ] we see that the largest clump radius has values of fos @xmath64 . on the other hand , for the smallest clump radius models",
    ", fos varies from @xmath65 to @xmath66 as one changes @xmath4 .",
    "finally , for the intermediate clump radius models , as one changes from @xmath8 to @xmath45 fos varies from @xmath67 to @xmath63 , with uncertain corresponding change in the temperature distribution .",
    "but , when the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath68 is considered , there is a meaningful temperature change . taken together",
    ", this suggests that variation in fos for fos @xmath64 may not be as important as variations in fos when fos @xmath69 or so .",
    "a more direct comparison suggests that fos always plays some role , but that a change in fos becomes increasingly important in determining the temperature for fos @xmath70 . for fos @xmath71 ,",
    "the spread in temperatures increases . to see this in figs",
    "[ plotranget10 ] & [ plotranget100 ] we have plotted the fractional deviation of the temperature of a point from the spherical average as a function of the fos at that point for all models in our grid . the points plotted cover all radii in the models .",
    "it is clear by inspection that fos directly correlates with the temperature deviation .",
    "interestingly , the correlation is strongest for fos less than @xmath72 . on the other hand , for fos @xmath71",
    ", there does not appear to be a direct relationship between fos and temperature deviation .",
    "however , for the larger values of fos the spread in temperatures is indeed greater .    taken together",
    ", this agrees well with the idea of streaming of photons through holes in a clumpy medium . for",
    "models with a small average fos , a position with a few extra lines of sight can receive significant additional heating . on the other hand ,",
    "when the fos for a point is high , it is well - heated by the external radiation field .",
    "however , direct shadowing of a point by a nearby clump , and attenuation by the ( assumed ) tenuous interclump medium can play roles .",
    "in fact , for the high optical depth models ( @xmath41 ) , the ranges of temperture deviations are smaller than for low optical depth models , due to the greater attenuation by the interclump medium .",
    "one further impact of clumps is to directly shadow points behind them , leading to lower temperatures .",
    "this effect can be seen directly in fig .",
    "[ lintemp ] . in this externally heated model",
    ", points just interior to clumps are decreased in temperature relative to equivalent points not directly behind clumps .",
    "two important questions arise : ( 1 ) over what length scale does this effect hold ? , and ( 2 ) is the cause a decrease in fos for these points ?    to answer the first question ,",
    "we have considered the temperature distribution as a function of distance behind clumps .",
    "the temperature at these points is consistently lower than the spherical average by @xmath73 per cent . to identify the shadowinglengthscale",
    ", we determine the distance , @xmath74 , behind the clump at which the deviation is 1/2 the maximum .",
    "a fit of @xmath74 of the form @xmath75 yields @xmath76 . as a result , we infer shadowing is important for lengthscale of @xmath77 clump radii behind a clump .    to answer the second question  the role of fos",
    " we can reconsider fig .",
    "[ fostempcut ] , which plots the fos and temperature as functions of position along three axes for a representative model .",
    "notice how well fos correlates with temperature , especially in the shadowed regions behind clumps .",
    "this is highly suggestive that fos is the determining factor in shadowing .",
    "more quantitatively , we can consider the fraction of sky closed ( fcs ) by the clump .",
    "using the previous notation , the fraction of closed sky is @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , this yields @xmath80 , and a corresponding fos of @xmath81 .",
    "this is near the limit of fos@xmath82 we inferred previously above which the sky is sufficiently open for the temperature to be insensitive to fos . as a result",
    ", we conclude that fos ( and thus actual shadowing ) is the important mechanism directly behind a clump .",
    "we have constructed a grid of three - dimensional continuum radiative transfer models for clumpy star - forming regions , in order to better delineate and understand the effects of clumping on radiative transfer . based upon this work",
    ", we find that :    \\1 .",
    "the inclusion of clumps  even for a constant total mass / average optical depth  can significantly change the temperature distribution within the cloud .",
    "these differences in temperature can be in excess of 60 per cent , and are due to the lower effective optical depth for clumpy media relative to equivalent homogeneous media ( sect .",
    "3 ) .    \\2 .",
    "the centers of clumps are warmer than would be expected on energy density grounds due to radiation trapping ( sect .",
