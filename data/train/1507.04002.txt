    "in this paper we present the  software tool .",
    "first , we provide the motivation and a short description .",
    "we then present the natural deduction system as it is done in a popular textbook @xcite and as is it done in  by looking at its formalization in isabelle .",
    "this illustrates the differences between the two approaches .",
    "we also present the semantics of first - order logic as formalized in isabelle , which was used to prove the proof system of  sound .",
    "thereafter we explain how  is used to construct a natural deduction proof .",
    "lastly , we compare  to other natural deduction assistants and consider how  could be improved .",
    "we have been teaching a bachelor logic course  with logic programming  for a decade using a textbook with emphasis on tableaux and resolution @xcite .",
    "we have started to use the proof assistant isabelle @xcite and refutation proofs are less preferable here .",
    "the proof system of natural deduction @xcite with the introduction and elimination rules as well as a discharge mechanism seems more suitable .",
    "the natural deduction proof system is widely known , used and studied among logicians throughout the world .",
    "however , our experience shows that many of our undergraduate computer science students struggle to understand the most difficult aspects .",
    "this also goes for other proof systems .",
    "the formal language of logic can be hard to teach our students because they do not have a strong theoretical mathematical background . instead",
    ", most of the students have a good understanding of concrete computer code in a programming language .",
    "the syntax used in isabelle is in many ways similar to a programming language , and therefore a clear and explicit formalization of first - order logic and a proof system may help the students in understanding important details .",
    "formalizations of model theory and proof theory of first - order logic are rare , for example @xcite .",
    "we present the natural deduction assistant  with a formalization in the proof assistant isabelle of its proof system .",
    "it can be used directly in a browser without any further installation and is available here :    http://nadea.compute.dtu.dk/    is open source software developed in typescript / javascript and stored on github .",
    "the formalization of its proof system in isabelle is available here :    http://logic-tools.github.io/    once  is loaded in the browser  about 250 kb with the jquery core library  no internet connection is required . therefore  can also be stored locally .",
    "we display the natural deduction proofs in two different formats .",
    "we present the proof in an explicit code format that is equivalent to the isabelle syntax , but with a few syntactic differences to make it easier to understand for someone trying to learn isabelle . in this format , we present the proof in a style very similar to that of fitch s diagram proofs .",
    "we avoid the seemingly popular gentzen s tree style to focus less on a visually pleasing graphical representation that is presumably much more challenging to implement .",
    "we find that the following requirements constitute the key ideals for any natural deduction assistant .",
    "it should be :    * easy to use .",
    "* clear and explicit in every detail of the proof .",
    "* based on a formalization that can be proved at least sound , but preferably also complete .",
    "based on this , we saw an opportunity to develop  which offers help for new users , but also serves to present an approach that is relevant to the advanced users .    in a paper considering the tools developed for teaching logic over the last decade @xcite ,",

    "this will show the underlying proof code and you can build formulas by clicking the red  symbol . alternatively , you can load a number of tests by clicking the load button .    at all times , once you have fully specified the conclusion of any given rule , you can continue the proof by selecting the next rule to apply .",
    "again you can do this by clicking the the red  symbol . furthermore ,  allows for undoing and redoing editing steps with no limits .",
    "all proofs are conducted in backward - chaining mode .",
    "that is , you must start by specifying the formula that you wish to prove .",
    "you then apply the rules inductively until you reach a proof  if you can find one .",
    "the proof is finished by automatic application of the rule once the conclusion of a rule is found in the list of assumptions .    to start over on a new proof",

    "in  we present any given natural deduction proof ( or an attempt at one ) in two different types of syntax .",
    "one syntax follows the rules as defined in section [ dedrules ] and is closely related to the formalization in isabelle , but with a redefined and more simple syntax in terms of learning .",
    "the proof is not built as most often seen in the literature about natural deduction .",
    "usually , for each rule the premises are placed above its conclusion separated by a line .",
    "we instead follow the procedure of placing each premise of the rule on separate lines below its conclusion with an additional level of indentation .",

    "throughout the development of  we have considered some of the natural deduction assistants currently available .",
    "several of the tools available share some common flaws",
    ". they can be hard to get started with , or depend on a specific platform . however , there are also many tools that each bring something useful and unique to the table .",
    "one of the most prominent is panda , described in @xcite .",
    "panda includes a lot of graphical features that make it fast for the experienced user to conduct proofs , and it helps the beginners to tread safely .",
    "another characteristic of panda is the possibility to edit proofs partially before combining them into a whole .",
    "it definitely serves well to reduce the confusion and complexity involved in conducting large proofs .",
    "however , we still believe that the way of presenting the proof can be more explicit . in , every detail",
    "is clearly stated as part of the proof code . in that sense",
    ", the students should become more aware of the side conditions to rules and how they work .",
    "another tool that deserves mention is proofweb @xcite which is open source software for teaching natural deduction .",
    "it provides interaction between some proof assistants ( coq , isabelle , lego ) and a web interface .",
    "the tool is highly advanced in its features and uses its own syntax .",
    "also , it gives the user the possibility to display the proof in different formats .",
    "however , the advanced features come at the cost of being very complex for undergraduate students and require that you learn a new syntax .",
    "it serves as a great tool for anyone familiar with natural deduction that wants to conduct complex proofs that can be verified by the system .",
    "it may , on the other hand , prove less useful for teaching natural deduction to beginners since there is no easy way to get started . in , you are free to apply any ( applicable ) rule to a given formula , and thus , beginners have the freedom to play around with the proof system in a safe way . furthermore , the formalized soundness result for the proof system of  makes it relevant for a broader audience , since this gives confidence in that the formulas proved with the tool are actually valid .",
    "in  there is support for proofs in propositional logic as well as first - order logic .",
    "we would also like to extend to more complex logic languages , the most natural step being higher - order logic .",
    "this could be achieved using the cakeml approach @xcite .",
    "other branches of logic would also be interesting , and the possibilities are numerous .",
    "apart from just extending the natural deduction proof system to support other types of logic , another option is to implement other proof systems as well .",
    "because the  tool has a formalization in isabelle of its proof system , we would like to provide features that allow for a direct integration with isabelle .",
    "for instance , we would like to allow for proofs to be exported to an isabelle format that could verify the correctness of the proofs .",
    "a formal verification of the implementation would require much effort , but perhaps it could be reimplemented on top of isabelle ( although probably not in typescript / javascript ) .",
    "we would like to extend  with more features in order to help the user in conducting proofs and in understanding logic .",
    "for example , the tool could be extended with step - by - step execution of the auxiliary primitive recursive functions used in the side conditions of the natural deduction rules .",
    "so far only a small group of computer science students have tested , but it will be classroom tested with around 60 bachelor students in the next semester . currently the tool has no support for student assignments and automatic feedback and/or grading . the tool could be extended such that the students are evaluated and perhaps given a score based on the proofs they conduct .",
    "it is not obvious how this could best be implemented .",
    "we hope to find the resources for the development of such features but already now we think that the tool has the potential to be one of the main ways to teach logic in mathematics and computer science .",
