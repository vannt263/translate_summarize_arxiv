    "continuing demand for high - density magnetic recording requires novel technology for realizing higher areal density . the emergence of shingled writing promotes research into advanced signal processing because narrowing inter - track pitch causes severe inter - track interference and jitter - like noise around track edges . under such circumstances ,",
    "two - dimensional signal processing based on multiple reading heads is becoming a hot research topic in this field .",
    "for example , such a system requires linear interference cancellation in both the cross - track and down - track directions .    in the near future",
    ", the size of bit - cells will likely shrink to be comparable to grains of a magnetizing material .",
    "as such , highly advanced two - dimensional signal processing will be required to handle strong linear interference from adjacent bit - cells and signal - dependent noise due to irregular grain boundary between adjacent cells .",
    "the concept of two - dimensional magnetic recording ( tdmr ) advocated by wood et al .",
    "@xcite has inspired research in this field .",
    "related research into , for example , signal processing @xcite , detection algorithms @xcite , and simplified channel models @xcite has been conducted for tdmr systems .",
    "one goal of the present paper is to develop a simple mathematical model for tdmr systems that is useful for performance evaluation of detection algorithms and for the design of two - dimensional codes .",
    "the _ simplified tdmr channel model _ presented herein incorporates the effects of both linear interference from adjacent bit - cells and signal - dependent noise .",
    "although the channel model is fairly simple , the model shows the complicated nature of signal - dependent channels . observing the behavior of the channel model will help to clarify the characteristics of tdmr channels .",
    "the second goal of the present paper is to present a method for evaluating the symmetric mutual information .",
    "the evaluation of mutual information is not a trivial problem for a channel with signal - dependent noise , but the problem is worth pursuing because it is closely related to the areal density limit of tdmr systems .",
    "before introducing the simplified tdmr channel model , we will discuss a two - bit - cell model in this section .",
    "although this channel model is simple , it provides insight for a tdmr channel and this model has a number of features that a tdmr channel model must possess .",
    "for example , this channel model can handle signal - dependent noise generated by the irregular boundary between two adjacent bit - cells .    a number of grains of a magnetizing material are spread over the surface of the recording medium . in the writing phase , a writing head magnetizes each grain upward or downward , depending on the information to be written .",
    "a magnetization process of each grain is determined according to the strength distribution of magnetic flux emitted from a writing head and the magnetic sensitivity of the grain .",
    "the first approximation introduced in the present paper is that the head footprint of magnetic flux has an exactly rectangular shape .",
    "namely , the magnetic field induced by a writing head has an effect on the rectangular area .",
    "this approximation helps to simplify the channel modeling process described below .",
    "this rectangular area is referred to herein as a _ bit - cell_. some of the grains lie between two adjacent bit - cells and cause irregular grain boundary between adjacent bit - cells . since a read - back system has no knowledge on the positions of grains , such an irregular grain boundary incurs jitter - like signal - dependent noise that makes it difficult to achieve reliable detection in tdmr systems .",
    "a read - back signal is obtained by taking the convolution of a sensitivity function ( i.e. , 2d - impulse response ) of a reading head and a magnetic field pattern caused by magnetized grains on the surface of a recording medium .",
    "a sample sequence of the read - back signals is sent to a signal processing and detection unit to estimate the written data . in a tdmr system , two adjacent bit - cells in a grid of bit - cells",
    "are closely arranged and a reading head with a wide ( compared to the size of a bit - cell ) footprint is often considered in a tdmr system .",
    "two - dimensional linear interference consisting of both inter - symbol interference ( isi ) and inter - track interference ( iti ) arises in such a system and should be appropriately processed to provide high reliability of estimated data .      the two - bit - cell model , which is an abstraction of a part of a tdmr system , is shown in fig .  [ tbmodel ] .",
    "this model contains two adjacent bit - cells , and the information written to these bit - cells is denoted by @xmath0 . between two bit - cells ,",
    "we assume that an irregular grain boundary exists .",
    "we also assume that two overlapping footprints ( denoted by head 1 and head 2 in fig .  [ tbmodel ] ) of a reading head are exploited to yield the two read - back signals .        in the two - bit - cell model ,",
    "the two read - back signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by @xmath3 note that the read - back signals are assumed to be appropriately scaled so as not to introduce additional scale parameters .",
    "the symbols @xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent gaussian random variables with mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 that represent system noises .",
    "the symbol @xmath8 is an independent gaussian random variable with mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath9 that corresponds to the irregular grain boundary between two bit - cells . in other words , we introduce a stochastic model for expressing the effects of an irregular grain boundary .    the following is an implicit assumption to derive the above model of the read - back signals .",
    "let @xmath10 be the vertical component of magnetic flux induced by the media at point @xmath11 .",
    "for simplicity , it is assumed that @xmath12 if @xmath13 is in the magnetized area corresponding to bit - cell 1 ; otherwise , @xmath14 is assumed . under this setting ,",
    "the read - back signal @xmath15 is obtained by @xmath16 a read - back signal can be considered as an output from a concatenated system of a 2-d low - pass filter with a rectangular window ( i.e. , head footprint ) followed by a 2-d sampler .",
    "although this assumption is based on an ideal case ( such a 2-d low - pass filter is not realizable ) , we expect the model to reflect the qualitative nature of an actual tdmr system .",
    "if there is no system noise or jitter - like noise due to the irregular grain boundary between two bit - cells , the following read - back signals can be obtained : @xmath17 some of the grains located in the middle of the bit - cell boundary have the same polarity as the value of @xmath18 , whereas others have the polarity same as the value of @xmath19 .",
    "the balance of contributions of such grains are modeled by a gaussian random variable @xmath8 in the proposed model .",
    "we adopt a gaussian model for representing this balance for two reasons : 1 ) as described later herein , a gaussian model leads to a mathematically tractable probability density function ( pdf ) of received signals , and 2 ) since the balance of areas @xmath8 consists of contributions from several grains ( i.e. , addition of several random variables ) , it is natural to model the balance of areas @xmath8 by a gaussian random variable .",
    "we can rewrite the model ( [ twobit ] ) in vector form , as follows : @xmath20 the first term on the right - hand side of the above equation represents a linear interference that occurs on @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the second term on the right - hand side is the system noise .",
    "the third term on the right - hand side indicates the jitter - like noise due to the irregular grain boundary .",
    "note that the last term on the right - hand side disappears if @xmath21 .",
    "namely , when two bit - cells have the same polarity , an irregular grain boundary has no harmful effect regarding detection .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side , representing the signal - dependent noise , introduces a certain difficulty in designing detection algorithms , codes , and evaluating the capacity of the channel .",

    "note that the shape of the contours around the dots depends on the signals .",
    "for example , the noiseless received signals @xmath25 correspond to the transmitted signals @xmath26 . in this case",

    ", the two - bit - cell model appears to be a simple model , but this model possesses properties that are not so intuitive . in this subsection",
    ", we will observe such properties in terms of signal detection .",
    "let us define a distance measure @xmath38 as @xmath39 which is derived by taking the negative logarithm to the conditional pdf of the channel .",

    "the peculiar shape of these decision regions suggests the difficulty of a direction problem for a channel model containing a number of bit - cells .",

    "in this section , we generalize the two - bit - cell model discussed in the previous section into a more general two - dimensional channel model that is referred to as a simplified tdmr channel model .    in the following discussion",

    "random variable @xmath70 is identical to @xmath71 and represents jitter - like noise due to the irregular grain boundary around edge @xmath60 .",
    "the random variable @xmath70 follows the one - dimensional gaussian pdf with mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath9 . of course , it is easy to provide more flexibility by introducing more parameters .",
    "for example , the coefficients of linear interference from the adjacent cells can be direction dependent .",
    "however , we will avoid introducing too many parameters so as not to complicate the following discussion .",
    "once the following argument is grasped , modification of the model would be straightforward .",
    "as in the case of the two - bit - cell model , jitter - like noise occurs around an edge between two bit - cells having distinct polarities ( fig .",
    "[ randedge ] ) .",
    "when the size of a bit - cell becomes comparable to the average diameter of grains , the effect of an irregular grain boundary around an edge tends to be the dominant source of noise that degrades the overall detection performance of a system .",
    "the proposed model includes the effect of the irregular grain boundary by introducing random variables corresponding to each edge in the writable area .",

    "this implies that @xmath78 obeys the multi - dimensional gaussian pdf .",
    "we therefore have the conditional pdf given by @xmath88 it is trivial to see that the conditional pdf of the two - bit - cell model is a special case of this conditional pdf ( [ condpdf ] ) .    as an example , let us consider the case in which the writing area consists of @xmath89 bit - cells .",
    "when all four bit - cells have the same polarity , the corresponding covariance matrix becomes a diagonal matrix with the diagonal element @xmath7 because no jitter - like noise occurs .",
    "the worst pattern in terms of noise variance is the checker - board - like pattern ( i.e. , any pair of adjacent bit - cells have distinct polarity ) because every edge between two bits causes an irregular grain boundary effect .",
    "in such a case , the covariance matrix has the following form : @xmath90",
    "evaluation of the capacity of the simplified tdmr channel is of practical importance .",
    "the capacity indicates the _ areal density limit _ for the tdmr channel without making any assumptions on coding and detection methods and may also give us insight into the design of a read - back system including detection algorithms and coding .    in the previous section ,",
    "we have derived the closed form expression of the conditional pdf that perfectly characterizes the channel model .",
    "therefore , in principle , we have sufficient information to evaluate the capacity of the channel given as @xmath91 the random variables @xmath92 represent written signals in a writable area and read - back signals , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath93 is the mutual information defined by @xmath94 however , the problem of evaluating the capacity of this channel is not trivial .",
    "of course , maximization of mutual information @xmath93 in terms of the prior distribution @xmath95 is a computationally difficult problem .",
    "even the evaluation of the mutual information itself is not a simple problem because we need to handle signal - dependent noise that results in a nonuniform conditional pdf .",
    "another computational difficulty comes from the intrinsically high dimensionality of the model .",
    "high - dimensional integrations are required for evaluating the mutual information .    in the present paper",
    ", we will focus on the symmetric mutual information instead of the channel capacity .",
    "the symmetric mutual information is the mutual information under the assumption that the written signal @xmath96 is equiprobable . from the definition of the capacity ,",
    "it is clear that the symmetric mutual information is a lower bound of the capacity and can be used as an approximate value of the capacity .",
    "this simplification makes the problem computationally tractable . in this section",
