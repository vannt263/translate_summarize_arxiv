    "@xcite and @xcite have summarized the relative importance of star formation , gas inflow , and gas outflow in the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "gas from the inner disk flows into the nucleus , perhaps driven by a bar potential @xcite , and some of the stellar mass - loss from the bulge may fall into the gc @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that this inflow of disk gas results in sustained star formation in a  central molecular zone \" ( cmz ) within a radius from the gc of @xmath3 200 pc . the gc is observed to be currently forming stars in the cmz at a rate of 0.30.6 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 @xcite . some of the gc gas incorporated into stars , enriched by stellar nucleosynthesis , will be returned to the gc interstellar medium by stellar mass - loss and supernovae .",
    "x - ray observations of hot gas in the gc suggest that some gas could be driven temporarily or permanently from the gc by a galactic fountain or wind @xcite , however , making it unclear how much enriched material is incorporated into following generations of star formation .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields in the gc also likely plays a role in whether enriched gas is driven from or is retained within the gc .",
    "continued star formation in the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy may lead to higher metallicities within the cmz .",
    "chemical abundances in the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to reach their highest values at the center ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h ii regions , planetary nebulae , and ob associations in the milky way also show a radial metallicity gradient @xcite .",
    "chemical evolution models strive to explain these gradients by considering the relative star formation and gas infall / outflow rates , and the metal abundance of the gas compared to the stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of gc stars is needed in order to constrain models and understand the stellar processes in the central parsecs of our galaxy .",
    "measurements of stellar metallicities in the center of the milky way galaxy , which is obscured by approximately 30 mag of extinction at @xmath6 , are only now beginning to be feasible through infrared studies .",
    "@xcite found a solar fe abundance in irs 7 , an m supergiant at a distance of @xmath7 0.2 pc from the gc , from a detailed abundance analysis of cshell ( @xmath8 = 40,000 ) @xmath1band spectra .",
    "our work analyzes similar data for several m supergiant and giant stars located in the central cluster , within 0.5 pc of the gc , and also one m supergiant star located in the quintuplet cluster , 30 pc away from the gc .",
    "the gc stars were selected with three requirements .",
    "first , they have to be brighter than @xmath9 = 9.5 , a limit set by the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "an hour of integration time is required for high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra for a @xmath9 = 9 star when observing with cshell at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "second , the stars should be cool luminous stars , to ensure we are observing photospheric absorption lines rather than the stellar wind emission lines characteristic of hot luminous stars in the gc .",
    "third , these cool luminous stars should have little or no water absorption .",
    "this is because published line lists for water ( wavelengths , excitation potentials , dissociation potentials , oscillator strengths , and damping constants ) are not yet adequate for detailed abundance analysis of high - resolution stellar spectra .",
    "the amount of water absorption is determined from @xmath10 and @xmath1band low - resolution spectra ( @xmath11 500 ) taken with the irs at ctio @xcite .",
    "the selected sample consists of nine stars located in the central cluster ( @xmath12 0.5 pc ) , and one star located in the quintuplet cluster ( @xmath13 = 30 pc ) .",
    "the central cluster stars are irs 7 , irs 11 , irs 19 , irs 22 , bsd 72 , bsd 114 , bsd 124 , bsd 129 , and bsd 140 ( names and positions are given by * ? ? ?",
    "the star located in the quintuplet cluster is vr5 - 7 @xcite .",
    "eleven cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood were selected from the literature to be observed and analyzed the same way as the gc stars .",
    "these eleven stars have known abundances from detailed analysis in the optical @xcite and in the infrared @xcite .",
    "these cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood were carefully selected to be in the same range of effective temperature and surface gravity as the gc stars .",
    "this is very important in order to allow a differential analysis comparison , which will cancel possible systematic errors such as nlte effects ( see sec .",
    "the selected cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath1band high - resolution ( @xmath0 40,000 ) spectra used in the abundance analysis were taken with cshell at the irtf .",
    "the irtf is a 3m telescope located at mauna kea observatory in hawaii , and cshell is the facility cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in 1993 may , 1996 june , 1996 august , 1997 july , 1998 may , 1998 july , and 1999 june .",
    "the detector for the 1993 observations was a 256@xmath14256 nicmos-3 hgcdte array , which provided a spectral coverage of @xmath15 1000 km  s@xmath5  or 73  .",
    "the detector for the rest of the observations was a 256@xmath14256 sbrc insb array , which gives a smaller coverage of @xmath15 750 km  s@xmath5  or 55  .",
    "the slit used to achieve a resolution of @xmath0 40,000 is 0.5  wide , 30  long , with a pixel scale of 0.25  per pixel for 1993 data and 0.20  per pixel for later data .",
    "our highest quality data were taken in 1998 and in 1999 when new order - separating circular variable filters were installed , providing spectra free of fringes .",
    "eight iron lines were selected by inspecting the high resolution atlas of cool stars @xcite and by analyzing synthetic spectra , which includes atomic and molecular features ( see details in section 3.0 and in @xcite ) .",
    "thousands of lines of molecules like cn , co and @xmath16 are present throughout the infrared spectrum of cool stars .",
    "the selected iron lines are almost free of known molecular contamination and unidentified lines .",
    "the eight iron lines are observed using three grating settings of cshell .",
    "atomic parameters of the eight iron lines used in the abundance analysis are listed in table 2 .",
    "spectra were acquired at two different positions along the slit and reduced separately , to determine any systematic effects like fringes .",
    "several individual spectrum pairs were observed per star , until the desired signal to noise ratio was reached .",
    "stars of spectral type a or b were observed as close to the program star s airmass as possible to correct for telluric absorption features and to remove fringes .",
    "such stars have no significant spectral features in the observed wavelength regions .",
    "image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and vista were used for data reduction .",
    "the reduction process began by flat fielding the individual spectra with calibration lamp flats , which were taken for every grating setting .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by subtracting two consecutive spectra taken at different positions along the slit .",
    "bad pixels were replaced by an interpolated value computed from neighboring pixels in both the dispersion and perpendicular directions .",
    "individual spectra were extracted with a 5 pixel wide aperture using the apsum package in iraf .",
    "extracted spectra observed at the same position along the slit were averaged to produce two spectra per star , one spectrum for each position along the slit .",
    "spectra of the program stars were then divided by the appropriate a or b type atmospheric standards , observed at the same position along the slit and reduced in the same way , to remove telluric absorption features and fringes . each spectrum was then multiplied by a blackbody of the same temperature as the a or b star to put the spectra on a relative flux density ( @xmath17 ) scale . the temperature of the a or b star was determined from its spectral type .",
    "more than five telluric absorption lines were used to obtain wavelength solutions .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using the tasks of vista .",
    "spectra were shifted in wavelength to correct for radial velocity differences , by comparing the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "the spectra were normalized by a linear fit of continuum bands .",
    "these continuum bands were chosen by comparing the observed spectrum of @xmath18 ori  from the high - resolution atlas @xcite with the synthetic spectrum of @xmath18 ori .",
    "the bands selected are regions in the spectrum where the synthesis and the normalized observations of @xmath18 ori  are coincident and equal to unity .",
    "we estimated the error per pixel as the difference of observations taken at two positions along the slit .",
    "we computed the mean signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel by the average of the signal to noise ratio per pixel for all spectra observed for that star .",
    "the mean s / n per pixel for each star is listed in tables 1 and 3 .",
    "the abundance analysis was done using a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite .",
    "the program requires a line list giving the wavelength , excitation potential , gf  values , and damping constants for all atomic and molecular lines that contribute to the spectrum .",
    "the method used to construct the line list is described in sec .",
    "in addition , an input model atmosphere for the effective temperature and surface gravity appropriate for each star and a value for the microturbulent velocity is also required .",
    "the solar - abundance model atmospheres from plez @xcite were used in our analysis because they are the only ones that include gravities and temperatures as low as those of the galactic center stars .",
    "the plez models also include sphericity , which is appropriate for supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "moog , however , does not account for sphericity in its calculations .",

    "the determination of the stellar parameters for our sample is discussed in sec",
    ". 3.2 .",
    "the line list was created the same way as @xcite , using two main steps : 1 .",
    "the solar spectrum was used to determine the gf  values and the damping constants .",
    "minor adjustments were made by comparison to the arcturus spectrum @xcite .",
    "an initial line list was compiled using fe i line positions and energy levels from @xcite and the @xcite line lists for cn and other atomic lines .",
    "the damping constants for all atomic lines were initially set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening @xcite .",
    "a synthetic spectrum was generated for the sun , using the @xcite solar model .",
    "the gf  values and damping constants were adjusted to match the observed solar spectrum @xcite , when needed , and unidentified lines were noted . then",
    ", a synthetic spectrum was generated for arcturus , using the model atmosphere , stellar parameters , and abundances from @xcite .",
    "the solar line list provided a good match to the arcturus spectrum .",
    "the gf  values of low excitation lines , not observable in the sun , had to be adjusted .",
    "the final fe i atomic parameters are listed in table 2 . a synthetic spectrum of @xmath18 ori , generated using the final line list ,",
    "is compared in figure 1 to the observed spectrum from @xcite in the region of each of our eight fe i lines . a plez model atmosphere with the stellar parameters listed in table 3 , and the cno abundances from @xcite were used .",
    "the depth of line formation was examined using contribution functions , which provide an indication of spectral line formation coming from different layers of a stellar model atmosphere .",
    "the determination of the depth of line formation is needed to make sure each line is formed in the range of opacity ( @xmath20 ) covered by our model atmosphere .",
    "the eight iron lines used in this abundance analysis are formed in the range of 2.0 @xmath21 log @xmath22 0.3 , where plez model atmospheres cover a range of 5.6 @xmath21 log @xmath22 2.6 .",
    "note that the sc i lines in supergiant stars , which neither we nor ( * ? ? ? * who included hyperfine splitting calculations for sc i lines )",
    "are able to model correctly , are shown by the contribution function to be partially formed at optical depths outside the range of the plez models .",
    "we therefore approximately model sc i lines by scaling the fe i line profiles to the correct depth and width to allow us to separate the one fe i line at 22399   which is blended with a sc",
    "i line at 22400  . in the case of irs 7",
    "this procedure was not successful .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath23 ) is a key parameter for any abundance analysis .",
    "for the cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood , the effective temperatures were taken from the literature .",
    "some effective temperatures come from spectroscopic measurements @xcite .",
    "other effective temperatures come from the calibration of @xmath24 colors vs. @xmath23 , where @xmath23  comes from angular diameters measured by lunar occultation @xcite .",

    "we adopt the stellar parameters for irs 7 from @xcite , which were derived using the standard plez grid of model atmospheres .",
    "their @xmath23  analysis relied largely on the second overtone co lines present in the @xmath25band ( 1.5@xmath26 m - 1.8@xmath26 m ) , because most of the first overtone co lines present in the @xmath1band are saturated .    for the remaining nine stars in the gc",
    "the @xmath25band spectra are too faint to be observed with cshell at the irtf , because of high extinction .",
    "therefore co can not be used to compute the effective temperature .",
    "for those nine gc stars , broad molecular bands present in @xmath10 and @xmath1band low resolution spectra ( @xmath11 500 ) are used to estimate @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "these features are co ( 2.3 @xmath26 m ) and @xmath16 ( 1.9 @xmath26 m ) . the co strength increases with decreasing @xmath23  and decreasing surface gravity ( log @xmath27 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 strength also increases with decreasing @xmath23 , but increases with increasing log @xmath27 .",
    "these two features together , therefore , provide two - dimensional spectral classification @xcite .",

    "nearby late - type stars with @xmath23  determinations based directly or indirectly on the lunar occultation technique @xcite were observed to calibrate our @xmath23  determination .",
    "the low resolution spectra of cool , luminous stars stars with known @xmath23  were taken with the irs at ctio , and with tifkam at mdm observatory @xcite .",
    "the distinction between giants and supergiants is determined by the presence or weakness of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the co index is computed in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "once the distinction between giants and supergiants is established , @xmath23  is determined from the relations shown in figure 2 , which are the best unweighted linear fit to the data .",

    "our value for @xmath23  from the co index of irs 7 , 3400 @xmath2 300 k , is also in good agreement with the spectroscopic value of @xmath23  from @xcite , 3470 @xmath2 250 k. irs 7 has a low carbon abundance ( carr et al .",

    "we estimate that the total uncertainty will decrease by no more than 0.05 dex , if we consider the correlation of the uncertainties in log @xmath27 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "systematic errors may be present as well .",
    "they may come from unidentified lines , which could make a contribution that is not included in our synthetic spectrum because of the lack of atomic and molecular parameters .",
    "they may also come from errors in the gf ",
    "values determination , or failure of the model atmospheres to correctly model the stars we observe , because model atmospheres use solar abundance ratios , or nlte effects .",
    "the iron abundance could be affected by departures from lte .",
    "the main nlte effect in late - type stars is caused by overionization of electron donor metals by ultraviolet radiation @xcite . using the saha equation",
    ", we found that in our typical star 93 % of iron is neutral .",
    "thus overionization should be smaller in our stars than in warmer giants , where only a few percent of iron is neutral .",
    "it is known from empirical studies that abundances derived from low excitation lines give systematically lower abundances ( @xmath400.3 dex ) than the ones derived from high excitation and ionized lines in late - type stars ; high excitation and ionized lines give very similar abundance results @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied nlte effects in fe abundances in metal - poor late - type stars .",
    "they found that ionized lines are not significantly affected by nlte , and that nlte corrections become less important as [ fe / h ] increases , being minimal for solar abundance stars .",
    "mostly high excitation lines are used in our analysis , so the nlte effects that might be present should be minimal .",
    "@xcite found that nlte effects cancel out when a differential analysis is carried out relative to a very similar star in terms of effective temperature and luminosity .",
    "nearby stars of similar effective temperature and luminosity as the gc stars ( see figure 2 ) have been analyzed similarly in this paper , providing a differential abundance comparison that should remove any nlte effects that might be present .",
    "each iron abundance value for a particular fe i line and star was derived from a comparison between the synthetic spectrum generated by moog and the observed spectrum .",
    "the [ fe / h ] results for each line for cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood and gc stars are listed in table 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties per line are estimated from the ability to distinguish models with different [ fe / h ] considering the s / n of the observed spectrum . for cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood",
    ", the uncertainty per line is estimated to be @xmath20.05 dex , since the s / n is very homogeneous among all lines and stars . for gc stars , the uncertainty is listed individually for each line in table 6 .",
    "figures 1 , 7 and 8 show the synthetic and observed spectra for each line for @xmath18 ori , cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood , and gc stars , respectively .",
    "the final [ fe / h ] results for each star are listed in table 9 .",
    "these values are the mean [ fe / h ] weighted by the individual uncertainties in [ fe / h ] for each fe i line , as listed in tables 5 and 6 .",
    "the final uncertainty in table 9 is the total uncertainty from table 7 and 8 .",
    "the analyses of our paper and @xcite have five stars in common : irs 7 , @xmath18 ori , hr 6146 ( 30 her ) , hr 6702 , and hr 8383 ( vv cep ) .",
    "there is agreement in the fe abundances within 0.1 dex for four stars ( irs 7 , @xmath18 ori , hr 6146 , and hr 8383 ) .",
    "our fe abundance for hr 6702 is 0.18 dex lower than that of @xcite .",
    "the abundance technique used in both studies is very similar , but @xcite included a different set of fe i lines and slightly different stellar parameters .",
    "irs 7 is known to be a variable supergiant @xcite .",
    "there is one fe line common to the analysis of @xcite and of this paper , which was observed at different epochs by @xcite and by us . for this line ,",
    "our result is consistent within the uncertainties with the results of @xcite .",
    "another spectrum of irs 7 , taken with nirspec at the keck telescope one year after our observationes was kindly made available to us ( figer , private communication ) .",
    "we have one fe line in common with the nispec spectrum , and again the iron abundance results from both data sets are also consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that the effect of variability on our irs 7 results are negligible considering our uncertainties .",
    "an unweighted mean value of [ fe / h ] = + 0.09 is obtained for the gc stars .",
    "a mean weighted by the total uncertainties in [ fe / h ] ( table 9 ) gives a value of [ fe / h ] = + 0.12 for the gc stars .",
    "the estimated dispersion or @xmath41 is 0.22 dex , which is not significantly different from the typical total uncertainty in [ fe / h ] for each gc star of 0.28 dex .",
    "even if the total uncertainties are overestimated by @xmath400.05 dex by the quadratic addition of the individual uncertainties , the typical uncertainty per star does not get small enough to resolve the [ fe / h ] distribution ( see sec",
    "this means that the dispersion of the gc [ fe / h ] distribution can be understood by the uncertainties present in the data .",
    "note that the supergiant vr 5 - 7 , at @xmath13 = 30 pc , has [ fe / h ] = + 0.09 @xmath2 0.22 , which is similar to the supergiants at @xmath12 0.5 pc , which have a mean [ fe / h ] = + 0.21 @xmath2 0.15 .",
    "an unweighted mean of [ fe / h ] = 0.05 and a mean weighted by the total uncertainties of [ fe / h ] = + 0.03 was obtained for the eleven cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood . the estimated dispersion or @xmath41 is 0.16 dex , which again is not significantly different from the typical total uncertainty in [ fe / h ] which is 0.20 dex for these stars .",
    "the obtained mean [ fe / h ] for the gc is close to solar , and furthermore , very similar to the cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood that were analyzed in the same way .",
    "our mean [ fe / h ] for the gc stars , + 0.12 @xmath2 0.22 , is similar to that of supergiants in the galactic disk .",
    "figure 9a compares the gc [ fe / h ] distribution with the [ fe / h ] distribution of 40 f , g , k , and m supergiants within 2 kpc of the sun @xcite .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] of the solar neighborhood supergiant stars from @xcite is + 0.13 with a dispersion of 0.20 dex . the width and mean of the two distributions agree closely . in figure 9b",
    ", we compare the gc [ fe / h ] distribution with that of the 11 cool supergiants and luminous giants we have analyzed in this paper .",
    "again , the mean and width of the [ fe / h ] distribution for the gc stars and solar neighborhood stars are consistent .",
    "unlike the @xcite sample of supergiants , our 11 nearby stars are restricted to the same range in stellar parameter space as the gc sample ; in addition , we have used the same analysis method , fe i lines , and stellar models for all the stars .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this differential analysis makes the abundance comparison between our samples of gc and nearby stars robust against possible systematic errors that might effect the absolute values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the fe abundances for the sample of gc stars in this paper are nearly identical to those of similar @xmath23  and luminosity stars in the solar neighborhood , with no evidence for a super - solar metallicity .",
    "our mean [ fe / h ] for the gc stars of + 0.12 @xmath2 0.22 appears to be in conflict with the iron abundance of the pistol star , at @xmath42 30 pc in the quintuplet cluster .",
    "@xcite derive [ fe / h ] @xmath40 0.5 for the pistol star .",
    "they qualify their result as preliminary , since details of the atmosphere modeling , such as the effects of charge exchange reactions , have to be studied and included in future work .",
    "the pistol star abundance is derived from emission lines in the winds from this hot star , so the atmospheric modeling techniques are fundamentally different from those more established techniques we have used to study abundances from photospheric absorption lines in cool giant or supergiant stars .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the central cluster was built up by continuous , perhaps episodic , star formation over the lifetime of the galaxy . in this case , the central 100 pc would form a stellar population distinct from the old population of the bulge . in figure 9c ,",
    "the gc [ fe / h ] distribution is compared with the [ fe / h ] distribution for 262 stars in baade s window ( bw ) in the bulge ( @xmath43 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have a typical uncertainty per star of @xmath20.2 dex , so their finding that [ fe / h ] ranges from 1.0 to + 0.5 in bw shows the abundance spread of bw s distribution is well - resolved by their technique . the distribution of [ fe / h ] in the gc , however , has a similar width as the uncertainties in [ fe / h ] , 0.28 dex per star .",
    "stars as metal - rich or as metal - poor as observed in the bulge are not found in our sample of gc stars .",
    "however , our gc stars are restricted to a young to intermediate age population , and hence an old stellar population , if it exists in the central 100 pc , is not sampled by the work of this paper",
    ". a larger abundance spread could be represented in such an older population , but a spectroscopic abundance analysis will require the sensitivity to reach k and m giants .",
    "a more complete comparison must also include measurements of the abundance patterns in the central regions relative to the bulge .",
    "for example , the bulge k giants analyzed by @xcite show a distinct enhancement in the @xmath44elements , compared to fe .",
    "an imf weighted toward more massive stars in the gc has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have found an imf slanted towards massive stars for the arches and quintuplet clusters , both located within 30 pc of the gc .",
    "a history of chemical evolution dominated by massive stars is expected to result in enhancements of oxygen and @xmath44elements , such as mg , si , ca , and ti , relative to fe @xcite .",
    "the next step of our gc project is to measure abundances of @xmath44elements and study selective enrichment in the gc .",
    "chemical evolution models try to explain abundance patterns by considering the relative star formation rate , the gas infall and outflow rates , the star formation history and the abundance of the gas compared to the stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most chemical evolution models that reproduce the radial gradients in galaxies are valid only for distances greater than 2 kpc from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "now that the molecular gas in the gc ( from which stars form ) has been extensively studied @xcite , and that the abundances of stars in the gc has been obtained for the first time , we strongly urge theoreticians to put all these data together into a detailed chemical evolution model describing the central parsecs of our galaxy .",
    "we present the first measurement of stellar [ fe / h ] for ten stars in the galactic center ( gc ) , at distances from the gc of @xmath12 30 pc .",
    "nine gc stars are located in the central cluster ( @xmath12 0.5 pc ) and one star is located in the quintuplet cluster ( @xmath13 = 30 pc ) .",
    "the abundance analysis is based on high - resolution ( @xmath0 40,000 ) @xmath1band spectra .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] of the gc is determined to be near solar , [ fe / h ] = + 0.12 @xmath2 0.22 , and also similar to the mean [ fe / h ] for cool , luminous stars in the solar neighborhood , [ fe / h ] = + 0.03 @xmath2 0.16 , observed and analyzed in the same way .",
    "the width of the gc [ fe / h ] distribution , which ranges from [ fe / h ] = 0.3 to + 0.5 , is found to be significantly narrower than the width of the [ fe / h ] distribution of baade s window , which ranges from [ fe / h ] = 1.0 to + 0.8 .",
    "the gc [ fe / h ] distribution is consistent with the [ fe / h ] distribution of supergiant stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this suggest that the most luminous stars in the gc are unlikely to be dominated by bulge - like stars , and that the evolutionary path of the gc , while unique , is closer to the disk s than to the bulge s .",
    "the quintuplet star at @xmath13 = 30 pc has a similar [ fe / h ] to stars located in the central cluster at @xmath12 0.5 pc . in the future ,",
    "abundance measurements of cno and @xmath44elements are planned to provide a complete view of the abundance patterns of the stars in the central regions of the milky way .",
