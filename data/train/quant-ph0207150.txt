    "the quantum state estimation is a classical problem in quantum information ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not only useful for various purposes , e.g. , evaluation of realized quantum information processing systems , but also is a fundamental problem in its own right .",
    "as is the case in classical estimation theory , often , it is assumed that the unknown source is a member of a parameterized family of quantum states , which is called _ model _ , to reduce the problem to the estimation of the unknown ( in general , vector valued ) parameter .",
    "sometimes , we are interested in some physical quantities of the state , e.g. entanglement of the state . in such cases , the estimation of a function of the unknown parameter is considered .",
    "so far , most of the studies of quantum estimation theory assumed that the model is a smooth surface in the space of quantum states , and that the function to be estimated are differentiable up to necessary order . under these smoothness assumptions , tractable lower bounds to the mse of the estimator had been studied , and some of them give achievable bounds ( @xcite ) .",
    "especially , in asymptotic regime , we have lots of results on achievable bounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "when there are singularities in the model and/or in the function to be estimated , a little had been found out , so far as general theory is concerned . it should be stressed that there are some practically important examples to which the smoothness assumptions do not apply .",
    "for example , concurrence , a measure of entanglement , is singular at zero point . also , considering that the state estimation is a fundamental problem of quantum information , it is better to be studied in most general setting .    the discrete models , or the models whose parameter takes values in a discrete set , are only non - differentiable models which has been studied intensively , and there are many results in special cases , mainly by exploiting symmetry .",
    "however , there are relatively a few results which are valid for all discrete models . to begin with , it is not straightforward even to work out a non - trivial lower bound to the error of the optimal measurement .",
    "it is true that the formula in @xcite , which is a special case of complementarity theorem of sdp , gives necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal measurement .",
    "however , this formula is far from tractable in many cases , for being a system of non - linear matrix equations and inequalities .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to give the first general treatment of quantum state estimation without the smoothness assumptions , developing quantum versions of hammersley - chapman - robbins inequality ( @xcite , @xcite ) , kshirsagar inequality ( @xcite ) and koike inequality ( @xcite ) in classical statistics .",
    "while the lower bounds under the smoothness assumption uses differential of density matrix , our new inequalities use difference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ sec : pre ] is preliminaries .",
    "we give a brief review on classical and quantum estimation theory , and set up the problem . in section [ sec : hcrk ] , we state our new inequalities , whose proofs are given in the section [ sec : proof ] . in the section [ sec :",
    "example ] , our theory is applied to several examples . non - asymptotic and asymptotic inequalities are derived , and based on those , optimal estimate are given for some of the examples . in section [ sec : discuss ] , we state the conclusions and the future problems .",
    "an important problem of classical estimation is to optimize estimator of ( a function of ) the parameter which is assigned for the unknown probability distribution .",
    "the error is often evaluated by mse under unbiased condition . here ,",
    "the estimator is said to be unbiased if its expectation equals the true value of ( a function of ) the parameter .    in many cases ,",
    "the optimal solution is too hard to obtain .",
    "however , a series of tractable lower bounds to mse s of unbiased estimators are derived using the first order and the higher order derivatives of the probability distribution with respect to the parameter of the model . the inequality based on the first order derivative",
    "is called cramr - rao ( cr ) inequality ( @xcite ) , while those which exploit also the higher order derivatives are called bhattacharyya inequalities ( @xcite ) . by definition , bhattacharyya inequality is always not worse than cr inequality .    in general ,",
    "none of these lower bounds is achievable , but yet there are many cases where one of them can be achieved by some estimators . in asymptotic limit , an asymptotic cr inequality gives achievable lower bounds in general ( @xcite ) .",
    "needless to say , these inequalities rely on the smoothness assumptions .",
    "these inequalities can be generalized to the cases with singularity by replacing ( resp .",
    "higher order ) derivatives by ( resp .",
    "higher order ) differences . a difference version of cr inequality ( resp .",
    "bhattacharyya inequality ) is the hammersley - chapman - robbins - kshirsagar ( hcrk ) inequality ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ( resp .",
    "koike inequality ( @xcite ) ) . by definition ,",
    "koike inequality is always not worse than hcrk inequality .",
    "when the singularity is absent , by taking difference infinitesimally small , those difference versions reproduces the derivative versions .",
    "we can also make an asymptotic version of hcrk inequality , but unlike the differentiable cases , this bound is not always achievable ( @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed description of the theory which allows singularity .",
    "quantum versions for inequalities under the smoothness assumptions , i.e. , quantum cramr - rao ( qcr ) inequality ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and quantum bhattacharyya ( qb ) inequality ( @xcite ) , have already been studied a lot .",
    "one important point is that , due to the non - commutativity of quantum mechanics , there are many quantum versions of those inequalities ( quantum cramr - rao ( qcr ) inequalities ) .",
    "a difficulty is that there is no best qcr inequality .",
    "that is , to obtain the tighter lower bound , one must chose a proper version of qcr depending on the estimation problem of interest .    however , if either the parameter of the model is scalar valued , or a scaler valued function of the parameter is to be estimated , an sld qcr ( defined later ) gives tighter lower bound than any other qcr s .",
    "also , in this case , an sld qcr gives the asymptotically achievable lower bound to the error of estimators , as in the classical estimation theory .",
    "now , we state the mathematical detail of the theory .",
    "let @xmath0 be a separable hilbert space describing the physical system of interest .",
    "denote the set of linear operators on @xmath0 and the set of density operators , by @xmath1 and by @xmath2 , respectively .",
