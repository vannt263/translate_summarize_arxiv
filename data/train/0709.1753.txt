    "it is seen that the maximum positions are situated at the same photon energy as in @xmath102 ( see fig.3 ) and their values are very close to these values in the unpolarized part .",

    "the representation ( [ 10 ] ) is convenient both for the analytical and numerical calculation .",

    "in @xcite the new representation of the function @xmath119 was obtained , which is suitable for both analytical and numerical calculation .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to @xmath120 . as a result we get @xmath121 where @xmath122 the integral degree of circular polarization of the incoherent radiation in a crystal we define by the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "the integral degree of circular polarization in the tungsten crystal ( axis @xmath66 , the temperatures t=100 k ) @xmath124 eq.([9 ] ) is shown in fig.6 ( the curve t ) , as well as the coherent degree @xmath118 eq.([10 ] ) ( the curve 1 ) and the incoherent degree @xmath123 eq.([16 ] ) ( the curve 2 ) as a function of incident electron energy @xmath4 . in low energy region",
    "( @xmath125  gev the contribution of incoherent mechanism dominates ( let us remind that the intensities of the incoherent and coherent radiation become equal at @xmath126  gev ) . at higher energies the intensity @xmath127 dominates while the intensity @xmath128 decreases monotonically @xcite .",
    "correspondingly the curve @xmath129 tends to the curve @xmath130 . at extremely high energy @xmath131",
    "gev @xmath129 tends to the external field limit : @xmath129=11/16 ( see eq.(4.88 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "the contribution of the lpm effect in the total intensity of radiation @xmath132 eq.([9 ] ) is defined in @xcite as @xmath133 . the relative contribution ( negative since the lpm effect suppresses the radiation process ) @xmath134 in the maximum is of the order of percent ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly we define the relative influence of multiple scattering on the photon integral circular polarization as @xmath135 the function of @xmath136 ( per cent ) is shown in fig.7 , it attains the maximum @xmath137 at @xmath138  gev , while @xmath139 attains the maximum @xmath140 at @xmath141  gev and @xmath142 at @xmath143  gev @xcite .",
    "one can see that maxima of corresponding functions are slightly shifted with respect each other and the highest maximum has @xmath144 . from the other side ,",
    "the behavior of all functions @xmath145 , @xmath144 and @xmath146 are quite similar : just as in the total intensity of radiation the suppression of integral polarization due to the multiple scattering is concentrated in the interval of moderate energies @xmath147 gev and scale of effect is of the order of percent .",
    "in this paper the spectrum of radiation from an electron of intermediate energy ( a few gev for heavy elements ) moving in oriented crystal is calculated for the first time .",
    "the interplay of the coherent and the incoherent parts is essential for formation of the spectrum . just in this situation",
    "the effects of multiple scattering of projectile appear .",
    "the same is true also for depending on polarization part of the spectral intensity .    in an oriented crystal at motion of an electron near the chain of atoms ( the axis )",
    "the atom density on the trajectory is much higher than in an amorphous medium . as a result ,",
    "the parameter characterizing the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process in a medium in absence of an external field ( @xmath148 ) becomes of the order of unity at enough low energy ( values of @xmath149 for tungsten and germanium are given in table 1 ) . from the other side , due to high density of atoms at the trajectory near axis , the strong electric field of axis acts on the electron",
    "this action diminishes the radiation formation length and expands the characteristic angles of photon emission and hence weakens the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process .",
    "so , one has to use the general expression for the radiation intensity which takes into account both the crystal effective field ( the coherent mechanism ) and the multiple scattering ( the incoherent mechanism ) for study of the characteristics of radiation .",
    "such expression for the unpolarized case @xmath103 was obtained in @xcite and the polarization term @xmath150 derived here ( see eq.([2 ] ) ) .",
    "the two first terms of decomposition of @xmath151 over the parameter @xmath47 define the coherent and incoherent radiation .",
    "it should be noted that in the incoherent contribution the influence of crystalline field is taken into account .",
    "other terms of the decomposition represent influence of the crystalline field on the multiple scattering ( on the lpm effect ) .",
    "since in an amorphous medium the lpm effect for the whole spectrum can be observed ( for heavy elements ) only in tev energy range ( see e.g. @xcite ) the possibility to study the influence of multiple scattering on radiation process in gev energy range is evidently of great interest .    in the present paper",
    "the detailed analysis of the spectral and the polarization properties of radiation is performed .",
    "the influence of different mechanisms of photon emission on general picture of event is elucidated . at high energy @xmath86",
    "the influence of the multiple scattering on the radiation intensity is suppressed strongly ( the coherent contribution dominates ) and only in the very end of the spectrum at @xmath152 the incoherent radiation becomes essential . in this part of the spectrum",
    "the nearly complete ( with accuracy @xmath153 ) helicity transfer from electron to photon occurs and the scaling defined by eq.([a15 ] ) takes place . for any energy",
    "@xmath4 the maximum value of the lpm effect is around 7 % is situated at @xmath154 . for",
    "@xmath155 the incoherent contribution dominates , its contribution is one order of magnitude higher than the coherent one .",
    "so at @xmath86 the maximum of the lpm effect is situated in very end of the spectrum where the mentioned scaling holds .",
    "it should be noted the very right end of spectrum is described by the bethe - maximon formulae with independent on the electron energy crystal corrections ( compare e.g. with eq.(8 ) in @xcite ) . for illustration of the discussed effect we considered the low energy @xmath156 , where both the coherent and incoherent contributions are essential , while the mentioned scaling is only approximate one .",
    "this energy region is suitable for experimental study .",
    "the polarization effects in radiation for the intermediate energy is analyzed for the first time .",
    "it is shown that the influence of multiple scattering on the depending on polarization part of intensity spectrum @xmath104 is very close to the lpm effect in the unpolarized part @xmath103 .",
