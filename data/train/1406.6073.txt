    "the existence of opaque dust clouds in the milky way blocking the light of background stars was revealed dramatically when observational astronomers exposed photographic plates to starlight originating from the direction of the galaxy s disk in the late nineteenth century [ 1 ] .",
    "the presence of dust as a more pervasive component of the interstellar medium was recognized by astronomers doing star counts to establish the dimensions of the galaxy [ 2,3,4 ] in the second decade of the twentieth century .",
    "general confirmation of the interstellar component of galactic dust , however , is generally attributed to trumpler s 1930 photometric and spectroscopic studies of the galaxy s bright open star clusters [ 5 ] .",
    "trumpler demonstrated that extinction of starlight must exist , amounting to @xmath8% ( 0.7 magnitude in astronomical brightness ) for every 1000 parsecs (= 1 kiloparsec , kpc ) of distance in the galactic plane [ 6 ] , otherwise open cluster diameters would increase systematically with distance , a most unlikely situation .",
    "the extinction differs markedly from that value in some directions .",
    "kapteyn , for example , earlier inferred 1.0 magnitude of extinction per kpc [ 7 ] from star counts in the direction of the galactic centre , whereas ngc  1893 towards the anticentre contains stars displaying extnction of only @xmath9 magnitude at a distance of @xmath10 kpc [ 8 ] .",
    "trumpler s study is of interest because it was the first instance in which photometry and spectroscopy of open clusters was used in conjunction with main - sequence fitting techniques to derive cluster reddenings and distances , in the process revealing information on the nature of yet another component of the galaxy , interstellar dust .",
    "subsequent refinements in the methods of studying open clusters resulted in modifications both to the variable - extinction technique and to cluster main - sequence fitting that helped establish mean properties for interstellar extinction as well as their spatial variations with location in the galactic plane [ 8 ] .",
    "studies of the wavelength ( @xmath11 ) dependence of interstellar extinction are tied to spectrophotometry of hot stars ( those of spectral types o , b , and a ) , such a restriction being essential to reduce the alternate effect caused by masking of stellar continua by spectral lines , which increase in abundance and crowding for cooler stars of spectral types f , g , and k. in addition , extinction by earth s atmosphere contaminates in systematic fashion photometric observations of stars made from ground - based facilities .",
    "its effects must also be removed to isolate the effects of interstellar extinction ( see [ 9 ] ) .",
    "it is now recognized from spectrophotometric studies of reddened stars [ 10,11,12,13,14,15 ] years ago that , at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , interstellar extinction depresses stellar continua in magnitude units in nearly linear fashion as a function of @xmath12 , as seen in fig .",
    "14 of nandy s study [ 15 ] , as well as in the studies by zagury [ 16 ] , zagury & turner [ 17 ] , and in fig .  1 below .",
    "it is convenient to graph the effects of interstellar extinction on stellar continua using a colour difference diagram , which plots continuum depression in stellar magnitudes as a function of inverse wavelength ( @xmath12 , e.g. [ 18 ] ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "here we follow the standard astronomical practice of plotting stellar spectra with wavelength increasing along the x - axis .",
    "it can be noted that the extinction is nearly linear as a function of @xmath12 from 0.8 @xmath13m@xmath14 ( @xmath15 m ) to 2.3 @xmath13m@xmath14 ( @xmath16 m ) .",
    "deviations from a linear law occur at shorter wavelengths , namely those lying below `` nandy s knee '' [ 19 ] at @xmath17 m (= 4350  ) , where the ultraviolet interstellar extinction normally displays some curvature ( fig .  14 in [ 15 ] , and fig .  1 ) .",
    "at such wavelengths the amount of extinction appears to be less than that expected from a simple continuation of the linear law at visible and infrared wavelengths .",
    "we expect no extinction at infinitely long wavelengths .    in the _ ubv _ photometric system of johnson & morgan [ 20 ] the _ b _ ( 4365  ) and _ v _ ( 5475  ) bands lie on the linear part of the visible extinction relation , while the _ u _ ( 3500  ) band lies below nandy s knee .",
    "the degree of linearity of the extinction curve can therefore be assessed , in the johnson system , using the parameter @xmath18 describing the ratio of the reddening @xmath19 , the difference in extinction in magnitudes between the _ u _ and _ b _ bands , to the similar amount of reddening @xmath20 describing the difference in extinction between the _ b _ and _ v _ bands .",
    "the ratio can also be written as @xmath21 , the curvature term _ y _ arising from the changing wavelength sensitivity of broad band filters on stellar continua as reddening increases .",
    "the parameter _ x _ , the slope of the reddening line [ 21 ] , varies with position along the galactic plane [ 8,22,23 ] , while the curvature term _ y _ is small .",
    "a study by turner [ 24 ] established a mean value of @xmath22 for local regions of the galaxy from high quality photometric and spectroscopic data for o and b - type stars in restricted galactic fields .",
    "typical reddening slopes _ x _ appear variable , however , ranging from perhaps 0.55 to 0.84 along different directions in the galactic plane . as will be demonstrated here , a linear extinction law of the type described by nandy [ 15 ] produces @xmath23 .",
    "the nature of interstellar dust has been established from the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction and polarization ( linear and circular ) in conjunction with the observed emission properties of warm dust clouds and simulations using mie models for light scattering off spheroidal particles . in the unified model proposed by li & greenberg [ 25 ] , the extinction and reddening in the visible and infrared arises from collections of small amorphous silicate particles with overall dimensions similar to the wavelengths of optical light ; an apparent dip in the ultraviolet extinction at 2175 @xmath2is attributed to molecular absorption produced by small carbonaceous grains",
    "( see the dip in the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , while a flattening of the apparent extinction in the far ultraviolet ( short wavelength portion of the red curve ) is attributed to very small graphite or silicate particles , or possibly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "in addition there are a number of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , of as - yet unspecified origin , superposed on stellar spectra [ 26 ] , although it is unclear if the 2175 @xmath24bump should be included in the sample .",
    "one of the first dibs to be discovered occurs at @xmath1  , with a maximum depth reaching @xmath25% of the continuum level in stars .",
    "most others are found at longer wavelengths .",
    "correcting for the effects of interstellar reddening and extinction is essential for nearly all studies in galactic astronomy tied to observations at optical wavelengths .",
    "extinction corrections , e.g. , @xmath26 for visual extinction , are made from a star s measured reddening , @xmath20 , using the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath27 applicable to dust extinction towards the object . observed values of @xmath28 are found to vary with galactic location [ 8,24,27,28 ] , as also noted by cardelli et al.@xmath2[29 ] when they derived empirical relations that appear to match interstellar extinction in the ultraviolet through infrared for different directions in the galaxy .",
    "the cardelli et al.@xmath2extinction law [ 29 ] predicts , among other features , that variations in _",
    "x _ and @xmath28 should be linearly related ( red line in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . perhaps",
    "because of ease of use , many researchers prefer to adopt mean reddening laws in their studies , typically for a value of @xmath29 ( e.g. , [ 30,31 ] ) .",
    "the cardelli et al.@xmath2study [ 29 ] established that interstellar extinction , from the infrared to the far - ultraviolet , can be modeled using empirical polynomial functions with a dependence on only one parameter , @xmath28 , in addition to reddening @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "their extinction formulae are tied to complex polynomial fits ( with up to seventh order terms ) that have no physical meaning . in some cases the cited fits to observations are not particularly accurate ( e.g. , reddened stars with no 2175 @xmath2bump ) and may be considerably improved if a dependence of the 2175 @xmath2bump on @xmath20 is introduced [ 32 ] .",
    "in addition , the decision by cardelli et al.@xmath2that @xmath28 is the free parameter of interstellar extinction does not appear to be judicious ; it can be shown that a mathematical consequence of the cardelli et al.@xmath2[29 ] law is that @xmath28 must be constant [ 16 ] .",
    "an alternate view of the extinction law has been developed by zagury [ 32 ] , who suggests that the existence of linear extinction over the entire infrared through optical region and the one - parameter dependence of the cardelli et al .",
    "[ 29 ] normalized extinction curves in the ultraviolet and far infrared are incompatible with potential variations in three independent types of particles from one interstellar dust cloud to another [ 25 ] .",
    "zagury assumes that the lack of extinction relative to a simple @xmath12 relation observed below nandy s knee does not result from a change in the properties of interstellar grains , but is the consequence of forward scattered starlight by interstellar gas clouds along the line of sight to the observer enhancing the observed amount of radiation from a star .",
    "as yet it is the only alternative to classical interstellar grain models .",
    "the very large amount of scattered starlight that is observed in the ultraviolet in the zagury formulation [ 32 ] , along with its @xmath30 rayleigh scattering intensity dependence , require that the scattered light be coherent scattering by hydrogen in the forward direction .",
    "an introduction to coherent scattering by hydrogen clouds in space is provided by zagury & pellat - finet [ 33 ] , although there is as yet no satisfying theory on the subject .",
    "in such a situation true interstellar extinction becomes a simple case of mie scattering over the entire infrared to far ultraviolet wavelength region , with an extinction law described by @xmath31 , as specified by the size distribution of the dust grains responsible . as an aside",
    ", atmospheric aerosols produce an identical dependence for their extinction [ 16,17 ] .",
    "a value of @xmath32 , the simplest situation , would imply an invariant value of @xmath33 throughout the galaxy [ 16,17 ] , whereas observed values of @xmath34 are typical of most galactic fields [ 8 ] .",
    "associated values of _ p _ for interstellar extinction must therefore lie in the range @xmath35 [ 17 ] , which is still similar to what is observed for atmospheric aerosols . by implication",
    "the size distributions of atmospheric and interstellar dust particles must be governed by similar physical mechanisms .",
    "anticipating the results presented later in this study , we argue that the true dependence for diffuse galactic interstellar extinction is described by @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    .reddening and",

    "the fact that stars for which @xmath23 display no evidence for @xmath7 absorption is expected from the discussion by zagury [ 22 ] about the strength of the 2175 @xmath2feature , which correlates directly with 4430 @xmath2absorption according to nandy & thompson [ 29 ] and wu et al.@xmath2[30 ] . that is substantiated by international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra for stars in the fields studied .",
    "most stars near su  cas ( only a few were observed by iue ) exhibit either weak or no 2175 @xmath2feature , consistent with the @xmath7 equivalent widths , while the few stars observed by iue in the carina cluster fields exhibit strong 2175 @xmath2absorption , as expected .",
    "the initial increase in normalized @xmath7 absorption with decreasing reddening slope _",
    "x _ in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is expected from the discussion associated with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as",
    "the forward - scattered starlight component strengthens in the near - ultraviolet _ u _ band , it encroaches upon the reddened stellar continuum in the optical region ( the 4430 @xmath2dib falls in the _ b _ band ) . around @xmath39",
    "the normalized @xmath7 absorption appears to saturate , and remains at the same level as _ x _ decreases further .",
    "that must relate directly to the mechanism that creates the 2175 @xmath2and 4430 @xmath2features .",
    "note that the observed colour excesses @xmath20 for @xmath40 are systematically underestimated from their true values in this scheme , so the saturation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is , if anything , underestimated",
    ". it would be interesting to establish if there is a corresponding saturation in the strength of the 2175 @xmath2feature for stars lying in regions of small reddening slope _",
    "x_. otherwise , the linear trend seen at larger reddening slopes is consistent with the results found by wampler [ 22,23 ] , despite small differemces in the adopted values of _ x _ for each field .",
    "it may be possible to include additional data in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] using measures of @xmath0 for stars lying in other regions where the reddening slope is well established .",
    "the main hindrance to such research is finding suitable spectroscopic data or measures of @xmath7 equivalent width , in conjunction with high quality photometry and spectral types for the establishment of reddening slope _ x_. the implied correlation between normalized @xmath7 absorption and relative strength of the 2175 @xmath2 feature proposed here is worth investigating further , but is difficult to confirm with the ultraviolet observations available .",
    "the concept does remain a distinct possibility , however .",
    "the nature of interstellar extinction in the galaxy is tested here using empirical observational data related to variations in reddening slope _ x _ ( @xmath41 for small reddening ) , observed ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath28 , and equivalent width @xmath0 for stars in well - studied galactic fields , typically regions of open clusters where the properties of the extinction do not vary appreciably from one star to another .",
    "the derived quadratic variation of @xmath3 with _ x _ is presumably related to increasing amounts of forward - scattered starlight in the ultraviolet affecting the optical colour excesses @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as well as @xmath3 , in systematic fashion , the effect increasing in direct proportion to the amount of forward - scattered starlight in the ultraviolet . as noted by zagury [ 32 ] ,",
    "the colour excesses for stars displaying such effects are undoubtedly underestimated from what they would be in the absence of scattered starlight in the ultraviolet . the observed dependence differs markedly from expectations predicted by the cardelli et al.@xmath2relationship for interstellar extinction [ 29 ] .",
    "an associated effect on equivalent widths @xmath0 for the interstellar 4430 @xmath2feature is expected because of the direct correlation between the strength of the 2175 @xmath2feature with @xmath0 [ 41,42 ] . the observed effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) is mostly as expected , with normalized @xmath0 absorption increasing directly with decreasing _ x _ from @xmath42 at @xmath23 .",
    "but there is a subsequent saturation of the normalized absorption near @xmath39 that , while expected , is not fully explained by the physical concepts of extinction proposed by zagury [ 32 ] .",
    "presumably it is associated with the mechanism by which absorption at 2175 @xmath2originates . in the original zagury proposition",
    "[ 32 ] a resonance mechanism for the forward scattering of starlight by clouds of hydrogen was proposed to explain the 2175 @xmath2absorption , but apparently such considerations are now focusing on a possible origin from interstellar h@xmath43 molecules , as suggested by sorokin & glownia [ 39 ] .",
    "either mechanism may also apply to absorption at 4430  , i.e. resonance in interstellar hydrogen or absorption by h@xmath43 molecules , given the obvious correlation between the two .",
    "a major repercussion of the present findings is that use of the cardelli et al.@xmath2[29 ] relations to correct for interstellar extinction is no longer justified .",
    "yet the same prescription is typical of the corrections made for extinction towards cepheids in other galaxies .",
    "although total extinctions for dust obscuration are made from observations over the visual and infrared _ vri _ bands in order to minimize potential variations from the galactic mean , it should be noted that dust extinction described by a @xmath6 absorption model predicts different intrinsic infrared colours from those usually adopted , as well as less total extinction @xmath26 .",
    "the differences might appear to be small , but tests indicate that they are significant [ 63 ] . for example , the 2175 @xmath2 feature observed towards galaxies at high galactic latitude is generally weak of absent , despite non - zero reddenings for the galaxies [ 64,65 ] , implying that a value of @xmath37 is applicable for them .    by implication , the derived distances to galaxies containing cepheid variables",
    "are likely underestimated in studies to date .",
    "since the same galaxies serve as calibrators for the extragalactic distance scale , the observational determination of the local hubble constant @xmath44 from such studies may contain systematic effects .",
    "that will influence the accuracy of @xmath44 expected by the sh0es collaboration [ 66 ] , for example , and possibly explain why recent values such as @xmath45 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 obtained by the carnegie hubble team using cepheids [ 67 ] are systematically larger than values of @xmath46 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 obtained by the planck collaboration [ 68 ] or @xmath47 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 obtained from ugc  3789 by reid et al .",
    "the proper treatment of interstellar and extragalactic extinction is an important consideration in such comparisons .",
