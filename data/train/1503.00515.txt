    "in the context of the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor , the seminal discovery @xcite of a well - ordered thermodynamic phase , viz . , bragg glass ( bg ) exhibiting braggs reflections , and its possible transition(s ) @xcite to a disordered phase devoid of bragg s reflections had lead to a generic vortex phase diagram @xcite applicable to almost all pinned superconductors .",
    "owing to the possibility of a sudden proliferation of dislocations on progressively increasing the magnetic field at a constant temperature , the quasi - long range ordered bg phase is anticipated @xcite to transform first into a multi - domain ( partially disordered ) vortex glass ( vg ) phase .",
    "such a transition usually reflects as a second peak in ( isothermal ) magnetization ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) loops , termed as the second magnetization peak ( smp ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "thereafter , at elevated fields closer to the upper critical field ( @xmath10 ) , there occurs another anomaly , known as the quintessential peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon @xcite in field / temperature variation in critical current density , @xmath11 .",
    "the pe is argued @xcite to signal the collapse of the elasticity of an ordered vortex lattice at a rate faster than the pinning force density near @xmath10 .    although theoretical treatment related to the bg to vg transition exists in the literature ( for example , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , the experimental tools , particularly those employed to explore the bulk pinning properties , such as , the dc magnetization ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) measurements do not always capture this transition . therefore , in the context of vortex phase diagram studies , it is tempting to ask a question- _ is the bg to vg phase transition generic ? _",
    "if it is so , then this anomaly must get exposed in the @xmath6@xmath12 space of all pinned superconductors , possessing a certain amount of quenched disorder . to address this issue ,",
    "we have investigated via detailed magnetization measurements , a low @xmath0 superconductor yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 , which has so far been reported @xcite to display only the pe phenomenon .",
    "a claim of the presence of smp anomaly ( or its counterpart ) in this compound has so far not been made by anyone .",
    "we have now found that the bg to vg ( akin to smp anomaly ) transition in this compound gets exposed prior to the onset of pe under the influence of an ac driving force present in the ( isothermal ) ac susceptibility scans ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "counter - intuitively , shaking of the vortex array by an ac drive in the present study has been seen to promote the spatial disordering in the vortex matter by assisting the bg to vg transition process .",
    "this observation is in complete contrast to the usual role of an ac driving force , which is to improve the state of spatial order in multi - domain vortex matter as reflected @xcite by the enhanced brightness of the bragg spots in the field - temperature phase space prior to crossover to the pe region in the vortex phase diagram .",
    "another interesting aspect of the present study is a revelation of the inequality @xmath13 at lower fields ( below a characteristic field , @xmath14koe ) .",
    "this amounts to stating that the vortex matter created in the field - cooled mode ( fc ) below @xmath8 exhibits better spatial ordering than that obtained in the zero field - cooled manner .",
    "this feature also is in sharp contrast to the behavior @xcite seen at the higher fields , where one encounters order - disorder transition ( _ a la _ pe phenomenon ) .",
    "the vortex matter created via field - cooling is expected to be spatially more disordered ( than the zfc state ) due to supercooling of an amorphous vortex matter below the pe region .",
    "we present evidences that @xmath8 signifies a crossover regime from an ordered bg phase into a disordered amorphous phase while reducing the field .",

    "the imposition of an ac field impulse results in the reconfiguration of an unperturbed fc state into state , comparison of whose @xmath43 value with that of the corresponding zfc state can be very instructive . we thus recorded the fc minor hysteresis loops. figure  7(b ) shows the magnetization curve obtained while reducing the dc field to zero after the ( perturbed ) fc states were created ( encircled ) at @xmath62koe , @xmath67koe and @xmath64koe . the initial magnetization value recorded while decreasing the field from @xmath62koe undershoots the zfc envelope , and the magnetization curve thereafter traverses a path that remains within the envelope loop as the field is ramped down to the zero value .",
    "taking cue from the linear relation between hysteresis width and @xmath43 @xcite , the ( perturbed ) fc state is reckoned to have a lower @xmath43 value than that in the zfc for fields below @xmath8 .",
    "this observation fortifies the inferences drawn from data in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "at @xmath63koe , the magnetization data , while reducing the field , first overshoots the zfc envelope though marginally , and thereafter it retraces the reverse leg ( @xmath28 ) of the zfc magnetization curve .",
    "it can be argued that the fc state here exhibits @xmath43 value slightly higher than that in the corresponding zfc states .",
    "a significant overshooting of the zfc envelope loop is witnessed at a higher field of @xmath64koe , which indicates a larger @xmath43 value for the fc state than that created in the zfc mode .",
    "note that the field value of @xmath64koe lies in the anomalous region , @xmath109 of the @xmath6@xmath12 space at @xmath53k ( fig .",
    "4 ) which , as discussed in section - iv ahead , is _ partially disordered in equilibrium _ as the multi - domain vg state .",
    "the magnetization measurement techniques ( both ac and dc ) employed in the present work have lead to new revelations in yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 which have been summarized in the form of a modified @xmath6@xmath12 phase diagram in fig .",
    "these include , ( i ) the occurrence of a broad anomaly located deeper in the mixed state triggering at @xmath68 line as seen in the @xmath4 curves ( fig .",
    "2 ) , ( ii ) identification of onset position of the pe at @xmath110 line as obtained from both the dc @xmath5@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "1 ) and the ac @xmath7 ( fig .  3 ) plots , and ( iii ) a characteristic line @xmath111 extracted from fig .  5 , below which a vortex matter created in the fc mode is somewhat more ordered than that obtained in the zfc manner . following a description of l - o theory @xcite",
    ", we argue that the anomaly in @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "2 ) reflects a shrinkage in @xmath86 as @xmath112 and hence , can be termed as an order - disorder transition in the vortex matter .",
    "note that the l - o theory is well applicable for weakly - pinned superconductors as in the present case of yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 ( ratio of depinning and depairing current densities is of the order of @xmath113 ) .",
    "the location of @xmath68 line deeper in the mixed state and its weak temperature - dependence outside the boxed region in fig .",
    "4 can be argued to relate to the disorder - induced transition @xcite of a quasi - ordered ( elastic ) vortex lattice _ a la _ bg phase to the dislocation - mediated ( multi - domain ) vg phase .",
    "note that the peak field of the anomalous variation in @xmath32 as reflected in dc @xmath5@xmath6 and ac @xmath4 plots , viz .",
    ", @xmath114 ( closed squares ) and @xmath115 ( open squares ) , is consistent , as the two sets of data points extracted from two different measurements can be seen to be overlapping in fig .",
    "this would imply that the complete amorphization of the vortex matter ( which is generally believed to occur at peak field of the pe @xcite ) occurs at the same field / temperature value while performing measurements via ac and dc magnetization techniques .",
    "various regions have been identified ( refer text for details ) .",
    "a delineation between the bg to vg transition ( occurring at @xmath68 ) and the pe anomaly ( at @xmath69 ) , is well apparent .",
    "the peak field values @xmath114 and @xmath115 obtained respectively from the @xmath5@xmath6 and @xmath4 data almost fall on the same phase boundary .",
    "the region between ( @xmath114/@xmath115 ) and the @xmath116 line presumably comprises pinned amorphous matter while the narrow space between @xmath116 and @xmath10 may involve an unpinned amorphous vortex matter .",
    "below @xmath111 ( obtained from fig .  5 ) , the @xmath6@xmath12 phase space region comprises ( reentrant ) disordered vortex matter , a vortex configuration created here in the fc manner is found to be slightly more ordered than that in the zfc mode . ]    it has been shown earlier that the annealing effects on the vortex matter , produced either by an ac driving force @xcite or by repeated cycling of the dc magnetic field @xcite , eliminate either partly or completely a ( metastable ) disordered vortex phase yielding an ordered vortex configuration .",
    "also , the residual presence of a disordered ( metastable ) vortex phase usually governs the onset position of the order - disorder ( pe ) transition(s ) @xcite . as a usual behavior , the onset position of the pe shifts to higher field values after the annealing of ( disordered ) vortex phase , whereas the same moves to lower fields when the amount of quenched disorder is larger @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the shaking effect of an ac driving force appears to be counterintuitive in the present study , as it promotes the spatial disordering of the vortex matter rather than its usual role of improving the state of spatial order .",
    "this is well apparent by the ( early ) occurrence of an order - disorder transition at @xmath68 line ( cf .",
    "8) in the @xmath4 runs which involve the ac drive . in the absence of an ac driving force as in dc @xmath5@xmath6 scans , the onset of order - disorder transition ( pe )",
    "is seen at higher fields ; @xmath69 values in fig .",
    "8 are located significantly above the bg to vg transition ( @xmath68 ) line . if one assumes that the shaking effect on the vortex array by an ac drive results in the lowest equilibrium - like state of the system ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) under given circumstances , then the region bounded by the phase lines , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in fig .",
    "8 can be accepted as _",
    "`` disordered in equilibrium '' _ in the form of multi - domain vortex glass phase .",
    "the present findings echo similar assertions made recently by us @xcite in another study in a single crystal of a low @xmath0 superconductor , ca@xmath1ir@xmath2sn@xmath3 .",
    "however , in that study in ca@xmath1ir@xmath2sn@xmath3 , a distinct demarcation between the bg to vg transition line and the locus of the onset of the pe anomaly in its vortex phase diagram was not apparent , which has now been clearly sorted out in the phase diagram of yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 .",
    "the nature of bg to vg transition had been argued to be of first - order @xcite in a high @xmath0 superconductor . to fortify this proposition",
    ", we may emphasize that the region bounded between @xmath68 and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "8 which is shown from the @xmath4 data to be disordered in equilibrium is indeed an ordered vortex phase when viewed from the outcomes of the dc @xmath5@xmath6 measurements .",
    "therefore , vortex phase in this region can be treated as a superheated ordered bg phase .",
    "this attests the first - order nature of the bg to vg transition in a low @xmath0 superconductor .",

    "the shape of the pe anomaly changes with field . at @xmath118koe",
    ", there is a tiny peak feature while a much prominent peak feature can be noticed at a higher field , @xmath97koe .",
    "the pe feature gets broadened at a further elevated field of @xmath64koe . ]",
    "the change in magnetic field tunes the inter - vortex spacing which , in turn , can influence the balance between the strength of vortex pinning and the ( elastic ) interactions between the vortices . as a result",
    ", the extent of spatial ordering / disordering in the vortex matter may vary in different regions of the @xmath6@xmath12 phase space .",
    "further , an enhancement in effective pinning at a given field value can give rise to a qualitative change in the evolution of the size of the larkin domain @xcite , as had been experimentally demonstrated @xcite via the evolution of pe feature in the isofield @xmath7 measurements in crystal(s ) of 2h - nbse@xmath36 .",
    "motivated by this , we shall now examine how the pe feature evolves with magnetic field in the case of our crystal of yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "9 the normalized    plots ( @xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 value at peak position of pe where vortex matter is most disordered for a given inter - vortex spacing and the underlying quenched random disorder ) against the reduced temperature@xmath121 , ( @xmath122 is peak temperature of pe obtained in the zfc mode for various fixed fields ) .",
    "the pe feature remains absent at fields below @xmath118koe ( data not shown here ) , which may be because of a disordered vortex matter prevailing there .",
    "note that the larger inter - vortex spacings at low flux density results in weaker interaction between the vortices to counter disordering influence of the pinning centres .",
    "the vortex configuration created at low fields ought to be highly disordered akin to the reentrant amorphous vortex matter anticipated in earlier studies @xcite . with the increase in field ,",
    "the interaction effects strengthen and consequently , a sparse disordered vortex configuration can progressively change into an ordered one , as has been demonstrated earlier in refs .",
    "this is apparent from fig .",
    "9 by the appearance of a tiny pe feature firstly at @xmath118koe .",
    "a more pronounced signature of pe occurring at @xmath123koe suggests further improvement in the spatial ordering of vortex matter with the increase in field prior to the onset of pe . at a higher field of @xmath90koe",
    ", there emerges a very well developed pe feature , which is indicative of a well - ordered vortex ( bg ) phase prevailing prior to the onset of the pe transition at this field value .",
    "a different scenario is , however , depicted at a higher field , @xmath124koe , wherein the order - disorder transition can be seen to be much broader .",
    "we surmise that the vortex phase prior to the order - disorder transition at this field value is partially disordered ( _ a la _ multi - domain vg phase ) so that any order - disorder transition would reflect a lesser shrinkage in @xmath86 ( as compared to that at lower fields ) or equivalently , lesser increment in @xmath43 @xcite associated with this state . in all , the |@xmath125| plots of fig .",
    "9 have lead us to infer that a disordered vortex phase at low field end ( @xmath126koe ) transforms into an ordered one ( bg phase ) with increase in field .",
    "a further enhancement in field may transform an ordered vortex phase ( bg ) into a partially disordered ( vg ) state prior to the onset of pe .",
    "it is useful to recall now a recent study @xcite employing the small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) technique in another crystal of yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 ( which would typically have different amount of quenched random disorder ) providing evidences at microscopic level in support of our experimental results . in the sans",
    "study , the evolution of spatial order in vortex matter with vortex lattice spacing ( @xmath127 ) has been well - depicted by plots of field - dependences of the normalized correlation lengths ( both longitudinal , @xmath128 and transversal , @xmath129 ) as well as their ratio ( @xmath130 ) ( see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "these lengths relate to the longitudinal and radial dimensions of the volume within which the flux lines remain correlated .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves in longitudinal and transverse directions reflecting the apparent quality of the spatial order and that of the bragg peaks remains nearly flat in the field interval @xmath131 ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 in ref .",
    "the normalized transversal correlation length ( @xmath129 ) starts decreasing more rapidly as the field reduces below @xmath76koe @xcite . near @xmath73koe , where we just start to observe the pe feature in    ratio",
    "has a value @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this could imply that when the quality of spatial order in the vortex matter gets more compromised ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) , the pe feature would not surface up . the longitudinal correlation length was seen @xcite to be nearly fifty times longer than @xmath134 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the ratio @xmath130 reveals field - induced changes in the parameter @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are respectively , the tilt and shear modulii of hexagonal vortex lattice .",
    "this ratio in their sample remains nearly constant between @xmath52koe and @xmath138koe and starts to fall above it and the rate of decrease becomes very steep above @xmath139koe ( see inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .",
    "such a trend could be interpreted that the quality of spatial order undergoes a change above about @xmath138koe and the elasticity of the vortex lattice plummets above @xmath140koe . in the context of our sample",
    ", this could rationalize that bg to vg transition happens above @xmath138koe ( see fig .",
    "the inset panel in fig .",
    "3(b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the simulated ( normalized ) vortex - vortex interaction in their sample does not continue to monotonically rise with magnetic field as the inter - vortex spacing progressively decreases with increase in field .",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction ( for the yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 crystal investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) reaches a maximum value near @xmath141koe and starts to decrease above about @xmath66koe thereby implying that the onset of this decrease is a consequence of notion of enhancement in effective pinning at large field values .",
    "near @xmath142koe , the value of the normalized vortex - vortex interaction force for this compound is same as at about @xmath91koe @xcite .",
    "the rapid decrease in this parameter below @xmath52koe reflects the dominance of pinning in the field domain of reentrant amorphous state ( cf .",
    "8) .    in our present study , the    plots of fig .  9 summarize the evolution in the spatial order of vortex matter with magnetic field , which ties up well with the results of sans study @xcite .",
    "the extent of spatial ordering / disordering in the vortex matter at a given field can be quantified by the ratio of    value just prior to the pe and that at the peak position ( see @xmath122 in fig .",
    "9 ) of the pe .",
    "note that the correlation length ought to be minimum at the peak ( @xmath122 ) of the pe and maximum ( for a well ordered vortex lattice ) just before the pe . in fig .",
    "9 , the said ratio of    onset and peak positions of the pe can be seen to be increasing smoothly with increasing magnetic field for @xmath143 , which is consistent with the variation of correlation lengths with field for @xmath144koe , as anticipated in ref .",
    "this would imply that a very well - ordered bg phase emerges nearly at @xmath97koe from a disordered state prevailing below @xmath73koe .",
    "further , at an elevated field ( @xmath64koe ) , this ratio decreases substantially as if a transition from the bg phase into a vg like phase has occurred there .    in the end , we draw attention towards the thermomagnetic history effects investigated at lower fields ( figs .  5 - 7 ) .",
    "it is customary to witness a more disordered fc state than the zfc in the vicinity of the pe phenomenon @xcite .",
    "however , the history - dependent magnetization behavior at lower fields ( @xmath145 ) studied here in yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 have revealed that the vortex matter in the zfc mode is more disordered than that in the fc case .",
    "the following scenario seems plausible to explain this feature . in the zfc mode ,",
    "the injection of vortices at high velocities into a superconducting specimen is influenced by surface barriers and edge effects @xcite such that the vortices eventually penetrate the sample through the weakest point of the barrier . inside the superconducting specimen , the vortices moving in bundles get randomly pinned at respective pinning sites such that the inter - vortex spacing is non - unique which leads to a non - uniform distribution of the flux - density . as mentioned earlier , the vortices are well separated at lower fields and therefore , the ( elastic ) interactions between them remain weak resulting in a stronger pinned ( disordered ) vortex configuration in the zfc mode . although the vortex matter created in the fc mode also remains disordered at lower fields , however , the vortices in this mode nucleate more uniformly as they remain oblivious to disordering effects of the surface barriers and the non - uniform injection through edges , etc .",
    "therefore , at lower fields , the vortex configuration in fc mode is less disordered than in the case of zfc . at higher fields , as the vortices get closer to each other and hence , the interaction effects become dominant yielding a better spatial ordering even during the moving state of creation of vortex matter in the zfc mode . on the other hand , during the fc mode , the vortex matter has to cross the pe boundary in the @xmath6@xmath12 phase space which results in supercooling the disordered vortex matter prevailing at the peak position of the pe anomaly .",
    "thus , at higher fields , the vortex matter created in the zfc mode is more spatially ordered than that in the fc mode .",
    "we have investigated via magnetization measurements , a weakly - pinned single crystal of a low @xmath0 superconductor , yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 .",
    "the present results have lead to the identification of bg to vg transition line and sketch of a characteristic field ( @xmath111 ) line in the @xmath6@xmath12 phase space of this compound .",
    "surprisingly , the smp transition like phase boundary has been unearthed under the combined influence of an ac driving force and a continuous magnetic field sweeping involved in the ( isothermal ) ac susceptibility ( @xmath4 ) measurements .",
    "this transition was , however , not observed in the ( isothermal ) dc @xmath5@xmath6 loops and the temperature - dependent ac susceptibility scans ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the latter two modes of measurements yield signature of only the quintessential pe anomaly signaling the collapse of elasticity of vortex solid at higher fields . an apparent demarcation between the domain of smp like transition and",
    "the onset of pe anomaly has been made in the vortex phase diagram of yb@xmath1rh@xmath2sn@xmath3 .",
    "the results presented in our specimen answer in affirmative the question of generic nature of bg to vg transition in a pinned superconductor .",
