    "target mass corrections have a larger effect in antineutrino scattering in the lower energy range of interest for @xmath42 , and for a larger energy range for @xmath46 , partly compensating for the nlo enhancement of the lo cross section .",
    "another approach to evaluating the few gev dis cross section by bodek and yang @xcite has been to phenomenologically model electron - hadron electromagnetic scattering in terms of rescaled parton distributions , then to use the appropriate parton distribution combinations for neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleons .",
    "a detailed comparison of this approach to the perturbative qcd evaluation with the order gev mass corrections would be useful , in part to try to assess the importance of dynamical higher twist contributions to the cross section .    in principle",
    ", the transition from deep - inelastic to exclusive processes in neutrino scattering can be modeled using duality arguments @xcite , however , the details of a practical procedure are difficult to determine @xcite . our results here",
