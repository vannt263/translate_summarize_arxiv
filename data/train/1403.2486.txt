    "due to the surge in data traffic , cellular network operators need to make large investments in their networks . for example , at&t acknowledged a 50-fold growth in wireless data traffic in a 3-year period , and kt , the largest network operator in korea , experienced a 10-fold data traffic increase in its wideband code - division multiple access ( wcdma ) network @xcite .",
    "although these operators invested extensively in their cellular networks , further efforts are necessary .",
    "the provision of wireless local area network ( wlan ) access points ( aps ) is expected to be one of the most promising ways of mitigating the surge in traffic in cellular networks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition to the deployment of wlan aps by cellular network operators , independent operators also provide these points in order to offer internet access services and obtain subscriber fees from users . generally , wlan internet access services are cheaper and faster than internet access through cellular networks , although their coverage regions are limited .",
    "thus , vertical handover ( handoff ) can occur at the boundary of the wlan coverage region between the wlan and cellular network .",
    "although the relationship between cellular networks and public wlan services is important , quantitative analysis of this relationship is , as far as we know , very limited .",
    "choi et al .",
    "@xcite compared the traffic growth of kt s wcdma , wimax , and wlan networks in 2010 and included some quantitative information .",
    "however , they describe the situation only from a macroscopic point of view and do not include any information for each wlan ap ( microscopic point of view ) or any theoretical work",
    ".    this paper examines a theoretical evaluation of the offloading of cellular networks through public wlan services and consists of two parts .",
    "the first part uses empirical data on the locations of public wlan internet aps and analyzes them as a spatial point process .",
    "an inhomogeneous poisson process is proposed as a model of the configurations of public wlan internet aps .",
    "based on the proposed model , the second part analyzes the performance metrics for the inhomogeneous poisson process model through integral geometry and derives the formulas for the performance metrics .",
    "much progress has been made in spatial characterization techniques over the past few decades , and these techniques have been applied in many fields including epidemiological analysis , earthquake occurrence analysis , natural resource distribution , geological analysis , agricultural production , and biological analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , research related to the first part , that is , spatial characterization of networks including aps and base station placement , has not been sufficiently investigated .",

    "they analyzed the spatial structure of wlan ap locations on the east and west coasts of the usa @xcite .",
    "they found that measured ap locations feature power - law or scale - free behavior in their correlation structures .",
    "they analyzed wlan ap location data and insisted that the geyer saturation model as a spatial point process fits the actual data @xcite .",
    "michalopoulou et al .",
    "@xcite quantified the dependence between the node distributions of wireless networks ( second and third generation ( 2g/3 g ) cellular networks ) and the underlying population densities .",
    "they showed significant statistical similarities between the locations of 2 g base stations and population since the deployment of 2 g base stations is complete .",
    "in addition , andrews et al . @xcite compared the coverage based on the placement of actual base stations and those derived by the poisson point process . however ,",
    "the main focus of this study is the derivation of the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio and information on the actual base station locations or modeling for them is lacking .",
    "even when we consider wired access networks , we can see that spatial characterization models have not been extensively studied .",
    "gloaguen et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite focused on the fact that the actual configuration of the wired subscriber network strongly depends on the physical route of roads and derives its stochastic model based on the road configuration model .",
    "their results enable us to remove time - consuming tasks , such as inputting road data or other geographical information , when we conduct simulations for network evaluation .",
    "integral geometry ( geometric probability ) used in the second part of this paper is a mathematical method for evaluating the measures in which a certain set ( normally a subset of a plane ) satisfies certain characteristics and has been included in several papers regarding network related issues .",
    "for example , a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite based on analysis using integral geometry proposed shape estimation methods for a target object based on reports from sensor nodes whose locations are unknown .",
    "lazos et al .",
    "@xcite and lazos and poovendran @xcite directly applied the results of the integral geometry discussed in chapter 5 section 6.7 of @xcite in an analysis of detecting an object moving in a straight line and in evaluating the probability of @xmath0-coverage .",
    "kwon and shroff @xcite also applied integral geometry in an analysis of straight line routing , which is an approximation of shortest path routing , and choi and das @xcite used it to select sensors in energy - conserving data gathering .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "empirical data sets of locations of public wlan internet aps are analyzed .",

    ", we investigate the spatial point process model for the ap locations .",
    "first , we investigate the hypothesis that they follow a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "because the statistics using empirical data reject the hypothesis and show that they are more clustered , we also investigate a model that is more clustered than a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "although there are many possible spatial point processes , we propose to adopt an inhomogeneous poisson process for the model because the number of aps deployed by individual operators at each subregion show high cross - correlations .",

    "[ map ] , we can see that all three operators have some common sparse regions .",
    "these are regions such as parks or shrines ; therefore , wlan aps are not allowed or it is practically impossible to place them in these regions . we should adopt a model that can describe this fact .",
    "similarly , the operators also have busy regions in common , for example , regions around train / subway stations . to evaluate whether there are common sparse / busy regions , the cross - correlations @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath20 were evaluated , where @xmath18 is defined as follows : @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ cross ] shows that there are non - negligible cross correlations , particularly between ( b ) and ( c ) and between ( c ) and ( a ) .     and",
    "@xmath20,width=226 ]    spatial point process models can be classified into two types . in the first type",
    ", the placement of wlan aps is assumed to be mainly determined by the locations of other wlan aps .",
    "we call these internal models . typical examples of internal models are matern , simple sequential inhibition , and gibbs point processes @xcite,@xcite . in the other type , which we call external models ,",
    "the placement of aps is assumed to be mainly determined by the location features of the aps themselves , rather than the locations of other aps .",
    "an inhomogeneous poisson process , i.e. , a poisson process with inhomogeneous intensity , is a typical example of an external model .",
    "because an inhomogeneous poisson process model is one in which each point location is determined independently of the other point locations ( unlike the other typical models described above ) , we adopt an inhomogeneous poisson process as a spatial point process model for @xmath16 . in practice",
    ", it is impossible for us to reject the internal model based on the data that we have .",
    "however , because of this cross - correlation analysis and the fact that the high- or low - density subregions are closely related to the existence of facilities there , we assume the approximation that the wlan ap locations follow an inhomogeneous poisson process with intensity @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the function of location @xmath23 .    assuming that @xmath16 follow an inhomogeneous poisson process , the later sections analyze , derive , and evaluate performance metrics , such as mean available bandwidth for a user and the number of vertical handovers through integral geometry .",
