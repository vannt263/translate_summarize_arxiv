    "quantum electrodynamics of massless dirac fermions defined in three time - space dimensions ( qed@xmath0 ) has been extensively investigated for 30 years @xcite .",
    "different from its four - dimensional counterpart , qed@xmath0 is a super - renormalizable field theory , so its ultraviolet behavior can be well controlled .",
    "this gauge field theory is known to exhibit asymptotic freedom @xcite , which means the gauge interaction becomes stronger at lower energies . because of this feature",
    ", intriguing non - perturbative phenomena are expected to occur in the low - energy regime . when dirac fermions are strictly massless , the lagrangian respects a continuous chiral symmetry . however , the strong gauge interaction may trigger fermion - antifermion vacuum condensation , @xmath1 , which generates a finite fermion mass and induces dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "_ first found that dcsb can occur when the fermion flavor @xmath2 is smaller than some critical value @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "motivated by this very interesting prediction , intense theoretical effort has been devoted to studying this problem @xcite . despite some debate @xcite , most of these analytical and numerical calculations agree that a critical value exists at roughly @xmath4 .",
    "a remarkable consequence of dcsb is that it leads to weak confinement @xcite .",
    "apart from exhibiting many properties interesting in the context of elementary particle physics , qed@xmath0 also has extensive applications in condensed matter physics .",
    "specifically , it serves as an effective low - energy theory of @xmath5-wave high - temperature superconductor @xcite and some quantum spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of dcsb in qed@xmath0 corresponds to the formation of two - dimensional long - range antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that qed@xmath0 may be simulated on optical lattice @xcite , which provides an opportunity of measuring dcsb experimentally .",
    "when the fermion flavor is beyond the threshold , @xmath6 , no dynamical fermion mass can be generated .",
    "there is no fermion vacuum condensation , i.e. , @xmath7 , and the continuous chiral symmetry is preserved .",
    "however , the absence of chiral condensation in the vacuum does not mean that the chiral symmetric phase is trivial .",
    "on the contrary , many highly nontrivial features can emerge in the symmetric phase of qed@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the gauge interaction is able to cause breakdown of fermi liquid ( fl ) .",
    "in 1973 , holstein _ et _ _ al .",
    "_ showed @xcite that the unscreened transverse component of electromagnetic field in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional non - relativistic electron gas leads to unusual logarithmic specific heat , @xmath8 , which is apparently out of the scope of fl theory .",
    "this discovery have stimulated extensive investigations of non - fl behavior in various gauge theories , in the contexts of both condensed matter physics @xcite and particle physics @xcite .",
    "the non - fl behavior of massless dirac fermions in qed@xmath0 has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "in addition , qed@xmath0 can be used to describe some intriguing states , such as algebraic spin liquid state @xcite and algebraic charge liquid state @xcite .    in some many - particle systems described by qed@xmath0",
    ", there is a finite density of massless dirac fermions .",
    "the finite fermion density is usually represented by chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "an interesting question is how this chemical potential affects the physical properties of qed@xmath0 .",
    "the impacts of finite chemical potential on dcsb have been addressed in @xcite , where it is found that the critical flavor @xmath10 is lowered as chemical potential grows and dcsb is completely suppressed when chemical potential is sufficiently large . in the chiral symmetric phase with strictly massless dirac fermions , the gauge interaction also leads to different properties at zero and finite chemical potential .",
    "for instance , the dirac fermion damping rate behaves as @xmath11 at zero chemical potential @xcite and @xmath12 at finite chemical potential @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider chiral symmetric phase of qed@xmath0 and study unconventional behavior of massless dirac fermions at finite chemical potential .",
    "we assume a relatively large fermion flavor @xmath2 so that the fermions are strictly massless",
    ". one important effect of a finite chemical potential is that it explicitly breaks the lorentz invariance . as a consequence ,",
    "the longitudinal component of gauge field develops an effective mass that is proportional to the chemical potential @xmath9 , which is analogous to the static screening of coulomb interaction .",
    "however , the transverse component of gauge field remains massless due to the gauge invariance . because of such difference in the longitudinal and transverse components of gauge field , the temporal and spatial components of fermion self - energy are no longer identical , which in turn gives rise to nontrivial renormalization of fermion velocity .",
    "we shall analyze fermion velocity renormalization by performing a renormalization group ( rg ) calculation @xcite .",
    "the fermion velocity remains a constant at zero chemical potential after including the gauge interaction corrections since the lorentz invariance is preserved .",
    "however , it acquires strong momentum dependence after developing an anomalous dimension @xmath13 at finite chemical potential .",
    "the appearance of nonzero anomalous dimension is a consequence of lorentz symmetry breaking and gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , qed@xmath0 with a finite chemical potential is fundamentally different from that defined at zero chemical potential .",
    "we then evaluate specific heat , density of states ( dos ) , and compressibility of massless fermions using @xmath13 obtained in the rg analysis .",
    "after analytical and numerical calculations , we demonstrate that massless dirac fermions exhibits unconventional , non - fl like , behavior at finite chemical potential .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    ", we consider a large @xmath2 and perform @xmath24 expansion . for convenience , we work in units with @xmath25 and restore them whenever necessary .",
    "it is now helpful to further remark on the physical meaning of fermion velocity @xmath16 .",
    "there are two ways to define the velocity @xmath16 .",
    "if we regard qed@xmath0 as a standard relativistic quantum field theory , the velocity of massless particles is simply the velocity of light , i.e. , @xmath26 . if , on the other hand , we consider the effective qed@xmath0 theory that is derived from a microscopic model of some condensed matter system ( for instance , hubbard model of high - temperature superconductor ) @xcite , the fermion velocity should be calculated from the band structure of the corresponding microscopic model . in the latter case ,",
    "the fermion velocity @xmath16 is no longer equal to the velocity of light , @xmath27 .",
    "its magnitude is strongly material dependent , but is always much smaller than @xmath27 @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we assume a constant velocity @xmath16 and study its renormalization due to gauge interaction at finite chemical potential .",
    "the main conclusion depends only on the momentum dependence of the renormalized velocity , but not on the concrete magnitude of the constant @xmath16 .    in euclidian space ,",
    "the free propagator of massless dirac fermions at zero @xmath9 is @xmath28 at finite @xmath9 , it proves convenient to work in the matsubara formalism and write the fermion propagator as @xmath29 where the fermion frequency is @xmath30 with @xmath31 being integers . for notational convenience",
    ", we use @xmath32 to denote the imaginary frequency @xmath33 , so that the fermion propagator can also be written as @xmath34      we first consider the case of zero @xmath9 . the key physical quantity is the fermion self - energy function , which can be used to calculate the rg flow of fermion velocity @xmath16 @xcite . following the rg strategy presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce two cutoffs @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath37 being smaller than @xmath36 . to the leading order of @xmath24 expansion ,",

    "( [ photon_propagtor_mu_eq_0 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ self_energy_mu_eq_0 ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath51 . apparently , the temporal and spatial parts of fermion propagator are equally renormalized , which originates from the lorentz invariance of the system at zero @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the fermion velocity @xmath16 is a flow - invariant constant .      at finite chemical potential , qed@xmath0 theory can exhibit qualitatively new features .",
    "first of all , there appears a finite fermi surface , which explicitly breaks the lorentz invariance . in this case , the temporal and spatial components of fermion self - energy are no longer equivalent , so the fermion velocity may be singularly renormalized .    to proceed , we first need to discuss the effects of a finite chemical potential @xmath9 on the effective gauge interaction function .",
    "these effects are reflected in the vacuum polarization function @xmath53 .",
    "it is technically hard to obtain an entirely analytical expression for @xmath53 , so we will derive an approximate @xmath53 that captures the essential features of qed@xmath0 at finite @xmath9 .    under the coulomb gauge condition , @xmath54 , the vacuum polarization tensor can be decomposed into two independent parts @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 they are orthogonal and related by @xmath57 now , the full gauge field propagator @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 where the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related to the temporal and spatial components of vacuum polarization tensor @xmath42 by @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "based on these quantities , it is convenient to write the fermion self - energy as @xmath64 where @xmath65    in an earlier publication @xcite , the full analytical expressions of polarization function @xmath53 was derived .",
    "these analytical expressions are too complicated and can not be directly used .",
    "it is necessary to make proper approximations .",
    "we first consider the temporal component @xmath66 . in order to simplify computations ,",
    "we utilize the so - called instantaneous approximation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath67 , and write @xmath66 approximately as @xmath68 apparently , the finite @xmath9 serves as an energy scale : @xmath66 behaves quite differently above and below @xmath69 . in the low - energy ( long wavelength ) limit , @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 as a consequence , the temporal part of gauge interaction becomes short - ranged due to static screening .",
    "in other words , the temporal component of gauge field acquires a finite effective mass that is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "such short - ranged interaction does not lead to any singular contribution to fermion self - energy , and thus can be simply neglected .",
    "we then consider the spatial component of polarization function @xmath72 .",
    "similar to its temporal counterpart , @xmath72 also exhibit different behavior above and below the energy scale @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath73 , we still use the instantaneous approximation and have @xmath74 when @xmath75 , @xmath72 vanishes at zero energy @xmath67 , so it is not appropriate to use the instantaneous approximation .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath72 should be explicitly maintained @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermion self - energy is dominated by the low - energy region of @xmath76 .",
    "we notice this approximation is widely used in the calculations of fermion self - energy due to gauge interaction @xcite and critical ordering fluctuation @xcite . in this region",
    ", @xmath72 can be approximated as @xmath77 at the lowest energy @xmath67 , we have @xmath78 this fact implies that , the transverse component of gauge interaction remains long - ranged even when the dynamical screening effect is taken into account .",
    "it also explains why the instantaneous approximation can not be used in this region .",
    "physically , the long - range property of the transverse gauge interaction is protected by the local gauge invariance .",
    "the fermion self - energy is given by @xmath79 according to the general rg scheme @xcite , one needs to integrate out the high - energy degrees of freedom ( fast modes ) step by step , until eventually reaching the lowest energy .",
    "since @xmath80 behaves differently at high and low energies , the self - energy should be calculated separately .    for small external momentum @xmath81 , we are allowed to make the approximation @xcite , @xmath82 , and write the first term of eq .",
    "( [ self_energy_mu_neq_0 ] ) as @xmath83 from rg theory , we know that the fermion velocity can receive singular renormalization only when the self - energy contains a logarithmic term .",
    "one can check that there is no such term in the regime where @xmath84 .",
    "nevertheless , a logarithmic term emerges as one goes to the low - energy regime where @xmath85 . after neglecting @xmath86 , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath87 paralleling the above analysis , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ sigma_b_mu_neq_0 ] ) can be computed in an analogous manner : @xmath88 now the total self - energy is @xmath89    this result is valid only when @xmath90 . as the energy scale decreases below @xmath69 ,",
    "@xmath80 should be replaced by its low - energy expression . in this case , the first term of fermion self - energy becomes @xmath91 in order to simplify calculations , we can divide momenta , frequency , and chemical potential by @xmath92 to make all these variables dimensionless .",
    "however , for notational convenience , we still denote @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "now , the above equation is rewritten as @xmath95 in the low - energy region @xmath76 , this integral becomes @xmath96 it seems easier to first integrate over @xmath97 and then integrate over @xmath98 , @xmath99 analogously , we have @xmath100 we finally obtain the total contribution @xmath101 here we keep only the logarithmic term , which survives at the lowest energy and corresponds to the stable fixed point produced by the long - ranged transverse gauge interaction .    summarizing the above results , we obtain the following rg equation @xmath102 where @xmath103 this equation has the following solution , @xmath104 where the constant @xmath13 defines an anomalous dimension of velocity @xmath16 and the dimensionless momenta @xmath105 actually corresponds to @xmath106 with @xmath107 being the uv cutoff . obviously , the constant fermion velocity becomes strongly momentum dependent due to the long - range transverse gauge interaction .",
    "the @xmath105-dependence of fermion velocity is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_v_f ] ) at both zero and finite @xmath9 .",

    "the finite anomalous dimension of fermion velocity distinguishes the system at finite @xmath9 from that at zero @xmath9 .",

    "although @xmath13 is finite only at finite @xmath9 , it does not explicitly depend on @xmath9 .",
    "it is the finiteness , rather than the precise value , of @xmath9 that is really important .",
    "a finite @xmath13 is generated as long as @xmath9 becomes finite , no matter how small it is .",

    "the properties of a fl can be manifested in a variety of physical quantities , such as spectral function , specific heat , dos , and susceptibility .",
    "the coulomb interaction does not destroy the stability of fl state in normal metals , because it is always statically screened by the collective particle - hole excitations .",
