    "therefore , the appropriate length scale to consider is the superconducting coherence length which is 104    for @xmath91 . in other words",
    ", our single - crystal samples must entail crystalline slabs of at least 104   thickness in order to exhibit the gl - type behavior of @xmath7 that follows from eq .",
    "an estimate of the mean free path of quasiparticles @xcite yields @xmath109   , which is much smaller than 104   , suggesting the scattering length is at least much smaller than the known slab thickness . at the very least",
    ", the fact that the effective thickness must be at least @xmath11020 unit cells suggests quasiparticles are not artificially confined , and that the the observed two - dimensional behavior in mr may be intrinsic to the electronic structure .",
    "the tetragonal fes system was originally predicted to be semiconductor in nature by bertaut _ _",
    "_ et al.___@xcite this claim was recently supported by resistivity measurements performed by denholme _ _ _ et al.___@xcite , which showed that their samples were non - superconducting with ferrimagnetic - like behavior .",
    "similarly , samples prepared by sines _ _ _ et al.___@xcite were also exhibited semiconducting and ferrimagnetic behavior .",
    "contrary to experimental evidence published before the work of lai _",
    "et al._,@xcite several other groups had predicted tetragonal fes to be metallic.@xcite vaughan and ridout@xcite proposed that the bonding in the tetragonal fes was metallic in nature due to delocalized _ d _ electrons in iron sublattice .",
    "recent density functional theory ( dft ) calculations also supported metallicity , in tetragonal fes.@xcite    geochemists studying mackinawite have suggested that the ferrimagnetic - like behavior from earlier magnetization data might have risen from the well - known thiospinel ferrimagnetic impurity , fe@xmath53s@xmath16 , considering the ease of conversion of mackinawite fes to fe@xmath53s@xmath16.@xcite several of our powder fes samples prepared through the synthesis detailed by lennie _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite form with an fe@xmath53s@xmath16 impurity as revealed by combined magnetization measurements and neutron powder diffraction ( figures s10 - 12 in sm ) .",
    "even denholme _ et al .",
    "_ acknowledged that the semiconductor behavior of fes could be attributed to the surface oxide layers of fes , as suggested by bertaut _",
    "_ @xcite indeed , similar oxidation has been observed in the fese system , as greenfield _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite reported that amorphous surface oxide layers of fese particles suppressed the superconductivity in fese .",
    "our single crystal results definitively support a metallicity in the normal state properties and superconductivity in the ground state .      compared to tetragonal fese",
    ", mackinawite fes contains more regular tetrahedral @xmath111fe@xmath111 bond angles where @xmath112 chalcogenide . in fese , the se ",
    "fe  se out - of - plane bond angle is 112.32(6)@xmath28 and the se ",
    "fe  se in - plane bond angle is 103.91(7)@xmath28.@xcite the respective bond angles for our fes powder and single crystal samples were calculated to be close to 108.1(3)@xmath28 and 110.2(2)@xmath28 ( table [ crystal_data ] ) .",
    "several studies have suggested that higher @xmath9 could be achieved from more regular bond angles,@xcite as is with iron pnictide superconductors.@xcite however , this structural parameter does not seem to be as important an indicator in the iron chalcogenides since fese exhibits a higher @xmath9 ( 8 k ) than fes ( @xmath9 = 4 k ) even though it is comprised of more distorted tetrahedra .",
    "this suggests that structural factors controlling @xmath9 in iron pnictides may not be identical to those of the iron chalcogenides .",
    "anion height has also been implicated as a reliable predictor for @xmath9 in iron - based superconductors.@xcite for iron pnictides , @xmath9 increases with increasing anion height as fep - based superconductors have lower anion height and lower @xmath9 than feas - based superconductors .",
    "however , @xmath9 begins to drop off for anion heights greater than 1.38  , which suggests there is an optimal anion height for maximizing @xmath9 .",
    "for fese with @xmath9 = 8 k , the se height is 1.45  , and upon application of physical pressure , the se height decreases to 1.425  , which leads to an increase in @xmath9 up to 37 k ( 8 gpa).@xcite for larger anions , i.e. fete , the anion height is larger than that of fese and while fete is not superconducting at ambient pressure isovalent anionic substitution as in fete@xmath113s@xmath114 induces superconductivity ( anion height = 1.75  , @xmath9 = 10 k).@xcite from this anion height principle , we should expect the smaller anionic radius of sulfide to lead to a larger @xmath9 .",
    "however , the anion height in fes was found in the range from 1.27(1 ) to 1.34(1 ) (table [ crystal_data ] ) , which is below the optimal height of 1.38  .",
    "this result for fes could therefore explain why the @xmath9 is remains low and between 3.5 and 5 k despite having more regular tetrahedra than fese or fete .    as a preliminary study on modifying the anion height in fes to affect @xmath9 , we have performed magnetization measurements as a function applied pressure .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fgr_pressure ] , measurements of magnetic susceptibility in a clamp - cell setup show that the transition temperature decreases with increasing pressure , at least up to 10  kbar . while it is known that @xmath9 in the related superconductor fese undergoes a dramatic enhancement under pressure , the increase in @xmath9 for fese occurs at much higher pressures than currently reached in the present experiment for fes ( on the order of 10  gpa )",
    ". further work to study the relation between @xmath115 and the crystallographic parameters as a function of applied pressure will shed more light on the relation between structure and superconductivity in fes .",
    "in conclusion , we have synthesized superconducting single crystals of fes and characterized their thermal , magnetic , and electrical properties . the synthesis of fes single crystals was accomplished through the novel method of reductive de - intercalation of k@xmath1fe@xmath2s@xmath3 single crystals under hydrothermal conditions .",
    "the fes crystals are stable up to 250 @xmath28c in argon and 200 @xmath28c in air . at 4",
    "k the fes crystals transition from a metallic , pauli paramagnetic state to the superconducting state . in both the normal state and superconducting states ,",
    "we observe a large anisotropy in the properties of fes .",
    "the upper critical field expresses a large anisotropy with a @xmath116 , the largest reported for any iron - based superconductor thus far .",
    "magnetoresistance measurements for the normal state performed as a function of applied field angle reveal a remarkable two - dimensional behavior in fes .",
    "overall , the physical property results indicate that the fermi surface of fes may be highly two - dimensional , and perhaps even more so than other closely - related iron - based superconductors .",
    "since the metastable system , mackinawite - type fes , is now confirmed as a superconductor and not a magnetic semiconductor , this system could be a template for the preparation of new sulfide - based superconductors that exhibit strong anisotropic behavior .",
