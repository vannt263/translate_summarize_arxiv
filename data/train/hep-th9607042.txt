    "non  trivial fixed points are a highly challenging aspect of renormalization theory .",
    "much of what is known about non ",
    "trivial fixed point is due to the @xmath5expansion of wilson and fisher @xcite , which is an interpolation from a critical dimension to the one of interest . in this paper",
    "we present another interpolation scheme where the dimension of the underlying ( euclidean ) space  time is kept fixed .    a prototype of a non  trivial fixed point is the infrared fixed point of massless @xmath6theory in three dimensions , also called wilson fixed point @xcite .",
    "we choose it as an example for our method .",
    "although it has been investigated by various other means , for instance by monte carlo simulations of the three dimensional ising model close to criticality , hopping parameter expansion , field theoretic perturbation theory for its scaling limit , and numerical integration of renormalization group flows in a number of setups , our knowledge of it is far from satisfactory .",
    "accurate data for its spectrum of anomalous dimensions is lacking , its functional form is largely unknown , in particular its locality properties , and its mathematical construction remains an outstanding difficult problem .",
    "we mention @xcite and references therein as a guide to the extensive literature .",
    "we mention further that all this has been accomplished to a very satisfactory status in the hierarchical approximation by koch and wittwer @xcite .",
    "our interpolation is a brick in the analysis of the full model .    as starting point",
    "we choose a functional differential equation from the infinitesimal renormalization group of wilson @xcite .",
    "specifically we choose a normal ordered and rescaled representation for the fixed point interaction , expressed in terms of a scalar field with non  anomalous scaling dimension .",
    "it contains a bilinear renormalization form .",
    "this bilinear form is continuously turned on with an auxiliary parameter such that zero gives a linear theory and one restores the full equation .",
    "the linear theory is arranged such that the @xmath6interaction acquires the scaling dimension zero in it .",
    "we then expand the fixed point interaction into a power series in the interpolation parameter .",
    "this part is similar to the @xmath5expansion . in order to perform the expansion to high orders on the computer ,",
    "the interaction is written in a basis of interactions which includes a general two point interaction in derivative expansion together with local higher interactions .",
    "we compute both the fixed point interaction and the eigenvalue associated with a massive perturbation .",
    "the resulting power series are evaluated by means of pad , dlog , borel ",
    "pad , and borel  conformal  pad resummation .",
    "the interpolation idea applies also to other renormalization schemes .",
    "the infinitesimal renormalization group is a particularly convenient one because it involves a minimal set of feynman integrals .",
    "interpolations in fixed dimensions can also be formulated for discrete renormalization group transformations both in continuum regularization and on the lattice , at the expense of dealing with general non  linear rather than quadratic equations .",
    "it is conceivable that our interpolation can be given a meaning beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section two",
    "we explain the structure of our particular functional differential equation .",
    "it is taken from @xcite and is the wilson equation @xcite in a kind of interaction picture . in section three",
    "we present our interpolation scheme .",
    "it is compared to a naive interpolation which has only a trivial solution .",
    "we solve our equations to lowest order to explain their recursive treatment . in section four",
    "we discuss their form in a coordinate representation .",
    "the result is a set of algebraic recursion relations for the fixed point interaction .",
    "they involve a set of structure constants whose computation again involves certain feynman integrals and multiplicities .",
    "we devote section five to this issue . in section six and seven the eigenvalue problem for the scaling fields of the non  trivial fixed point and their anomalous dimensions",
    "is treated along the same lines .",
    "we restrict our attention to a mass perturbation of the fixed point and the associated critical index @xmath1 . in chapter eight and nine",
    "the resulting recursions are studied by means of computer algebra .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of our results on the value @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a real scalar field @xmath7 on three dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we use a momentum space renormalization group built from the decomposition of a massless propagator @xmath8 with exponential ultraviolet regulator .",
    "the renormalization group will be formulated in terms of an interaction @xmath9 .",

    "the left hand side of ( [ fixed ] ) is a generator of dilatations @xmath11 acting on the interaction .",
    "the field @xmath7 is here rescaled non  anomalously with its canonical dimension at the trivial fixed point .",
    "it should be distinguished from the scaling fields of the infrared fixed point which have non  zero anomalous dimensions .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ fixed ] ) is a bilinear renormalization group form @xmath12 it can be visualized as a sum of contractions between two copies of the interaction .",

    "our point of view in this approach will be more modest .",
    "an interaction @xmath9 will stand for a power series @xmath16 in the field , with symmetric euclidean invariant distributional kernels given by fourier integrals @xmath17 of smooth momentum space kernels .",
    "i.e. , we identify an interaction with its collection of momentum space kernels .",
    "the question of convergence of the expansion ( [ power ] ) in powers of fields will not be addressed .",
    "it is conceivable that it could be tackled with a suitable norm on the collection of momentum space kernels as a whole .    in the iterative approach to be defined below we will meet at finite order no more than polynomial expressions in the field",
    ". we will understand ( [ fixed ] ) as a system of differential equations for the momentum space kernels .",
    "its explicit form can be looked up in @xcite .",
    "boundary data is substituted for by the condition of regularity .",
    "homogeneous functions give particular kernels , which correspond to scaling fields of the trivial fixed point . expanding a kernel in powers of momentum derivatives",

    "a natural candidate is @xmath18 with an interpolation parameter @xmath19 .",
    "it can be thought to turn on continuously the bilinear form , which is identified as the source of troubles .",
    "the interpolation ( [ naive ] ) is inappropriate for the following reason , when the dimension parameter is fixed to three .",
    "expand the interpolated interaction as a function of the interpolation parameter in a power series @xmath20 unfortunately there is little hope that ( [ pertur ] ) has a finite radius of convergence both in the case of ( [ naive ] ) and the interpolation ( [ better ] ) considered below . to be cautious",
    "we will therefore view ( [ pertur ] ) as a formal power series and interpret all equations below in this sense .",
    "it will however be argued that non  perturbative information can be extracted by borel resummation . in order to solve ( [ naive ] ) , the expansion ( [ pertur ] ) has to satisfy @xmath21 to every order @xmath22 , with the understanding @xmath23 .",
    "in particular it requires the interaction to satisfy @xmath24 to zeroth order . in other words ,",
    "the zeroth order has to be a marginal scaling field of the trivial fixed point . in three dimensions we have two marginal scaling fields ,",
    "a wave function term and a @xmath25vertex , to be abbreviated as @xmath26 we emphasize that vertices should be understood as momentum space kernels at zero momentum and their taylor expansions . each of them comes with a formal orthogonal projector @xmath27 and @xmath28 , selecting the corresponding vertex from a general interaction ( [ power ] ) .",

    "we reformulate the fixed point equation ( [ better ] ) into an algebraic system of equations for a set of coupling constants .",

    "we also require it to close under the action of the bilinear renormalization group form .",
    "for any two vertices @xmath55 and @xmath61 the bilinear form ( [ bilinear ] ) will be assumed to be a linear combination @xmath62 with a set of structure constants @xmath63 . the scaling dimensions @xmath60 and the structure constants @xmath63 comprise all the information needed in the following about the system of vertices .",
    "we remark that the structure constants are well defined through @xmath64 even when the system does not close under the bilinear form . in this case ( [ structure ] ) holds only up to an error term .",
    "below we will indeed work with an approximation of this kind and argue that the error term is small .",
    "we define a coordinate representation for the interpolated interaction in terms of a given system of vertices as @xmath65 the idea is then to investigate the interpolation ( [ better ] ) for the infrared fixed point by means of the parameter dependent coordinates ( [ coordinates ] ) .",

    "we remark that the sums in ( [ couprecursion ] ) and ( [ otherrecursion ] ) will be finite in the system of vertices considered below .",
    "the reason is that the outcome of the bilinear form of two monomials in the field is a polynomial in the field of finite order , and consists only of connected vertices .",

    "the interpolation was arranged such that the zeroth order is a @xmath6vertex .",
