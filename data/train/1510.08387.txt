    "the observed astrophysical flux emerges from under more steep air show spectrum at about @xmath5 tev and has a cutoff at @xmath6 pev .",
    "the neutrino typically carries a small part of the primary proton energy , @xmath7 , so the protons with energies up to @xmath8 ev are required to explain the observations ( this energy is @xmath9 ev / nucleon in the case of neutrino production by nuclei ) .",

    "they are the principle sources of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism suggested in @xcite can provide the acceleration of protons and nuclei in the most frequent type iip , ia , ib / c supernova events up to about @xmath13 ev that allows to explain the spectrum and composition of galactic cosmic rays with a proton - helium knee at @xmath14 ev and the maximum energy @xmath9 ev where iron nuclei dominate , see @xcite .",
    "two orders of magnitude higher @xmath8 ev / nucleon is needed to explain the icecube neutrino observations .",
    "it can be achieved with the type iin supernovae that stand out because of extremely dense wind of their progenitor stars with a mass loss rate @xmath15 yr@xmath16 @xcite . as it will be shown below , the large kinetic energy of explosion and very high gas density in the acceleration region lead to the needed energy of accelerated particles and efficiency of neutrino production in @xmath1 interactions .",

    "simple analytical estimates showed that radiowaves , gamma - rays and neutrinos might be observable from the nearest type iin supernova remnants if the efficient diffusive shock acceleration takes place in these objects . in the present paper",
    "we develop this idea further and investigate whether the flux of neutrinos produced in extragalactic type iin supernova remnants can explain the icecube data . for this purpose",
    "we perform numerical modeling of particle acceleration in a supernova remnant produced by type iin supernova explosion and calculate neutrino production .",
    "our model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration describes the remnant evolution and the production of energetic particles .",

    "in addition the input of atmospheric neutrinos can be significant at these energies .",
    "using the same approach we can calculate the flux of extragalactic protons .",
    "our results are compared with cosmic ray data in fig.7 .",

    "the calculated flux is not corrected for possible magnetic horizon effect that can considerably suppress the flux below about @xmath153 ev @xcite .",

    "it is interesting that the corresponding luminosity @xmath171 erg s@xmath16 is comparable with the optical luminosity of type iin supernovae .",
    "this is not surprising because both quantities are determined by the energetics of the forward shock .",
    "the optical luminosity can be estimated from relation ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath172    here the factor @xmath173 .",
    "this expression is often used to estimate the mass loss @xmath71 of type iin supernova progenitors .    comparing with eq .",
    "( 12 ) we can rewrite the neutrino flux at @xmath170 as    @xmath174 @xmath175 here we express the optical flux via the supernova visual magnitude @xmath176 .",

    "this is far from a so called calorimeter regime @xmath182 when a significant part of type iin supernova explosion energy is transferred to neutrinos .",
    "the background flux is several times higher if the cosmological evolution of supernova rate is taken into account ( see eq .",
    "these estimates are valid at neutrino energies @xmath183 .",
    "they confirm the efficiency of high energy neutrino production in supernova explosion in the very dense wind of a progenitor star , as it takes place in the case of type iin supernova .",
    "the rate of type iin supernovae @xmath184 mpc@xmath145 yr@xmath16 was adjusted in our calculations to reproduce the icecube observations .",
    "probably the real type iin supernova rate is several times higher .",
    "however not all type iin supernovae have such high mass loss rates and explosion energies as we assumed .",
    "our calculations show that the icecube data can be explained by the neutrinos from type iin supernovae .",
    "if so , the arrival direction of every icecube neutrino coincides with the direction to some type iin supernova .",
    "however , we observe type iin supernovae with the redshifts @xmath185 while the background is determined by the supernovae with @xmath186 .",

    "this nearest type iin supernova in the circinus galaxy at the same distance 4 mpc was also detected in radio , x - rays and optics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the circinus galaxy is a bright source of gev gamma rays @xcite .",
    "it is known that the forward shock of sn1996cr entered the dense shell of circumstellar matter .",
    "the radio flux of this supernova is only several times lower than the flux shown in fig.5 .",
    "that is why this icecube pev neutrino candidate could be emitted by sn 1996cr .",
    "we also looked for icecube neutrinos in the vicinity of recent brightest type iin supernova 2010jl ( @xmath18813.5 ) and 2011fh ( @xmath18814.5 ) .",
    "there were 3 icecube neutrinos ( events 9 , 11 , 26 ) within 25@xmath0 from 2010jl supernova and 2 icecube neutrinos ( events 16 , 49 ) within 10@xmath0 from supernova 2011fh . using the measured icecube neutrino count rate 1.1 neutrino yr@xmath16 sr@xmath16 we estimate the expected number of 1.2 neutrino per 1.5 year in the vicinity of supernova 2010jl and 0.44 neutrino per 4 year in the vicinity of supernova 2011fh .",
    "so it seems that there is some neutrino flux enhancement in the direction of brightest type iin supernovae .",
    "in addition the first neutrino ( event 16 ) in the vicinity of supernova 2011fh was detected exactly at the time of the supernova discovery .",
    "@xmath189 of @xmath12 icecube neutrinos left tracks in the detector .",
