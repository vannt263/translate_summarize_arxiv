    "previous work by grisha mikhalkin @xcite , by michael kerber and hannah markwig @xcite and by magnus vigeland @xcite shows that the length of the cycle of a tropical curve of genus one has properties which one classically attributes to the @xmath9-invariant of an elliptic curve without giving a direct link between these two numbers . in @xcite",
    "we established such a direct link for plane cubics by showing that the tropicalization of the @xmath9-invariant is _ in general _ the negative of the cycle length . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this result to elliptic curves on other toric surfaces using the same methods .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 is a marked polygon with one interior point , then a general polynomial @xmath1 $ ] with support @xmath2 defines an elliptic curve @xmath3 on the toric surface @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 has a non - archimedean valuation we can tropicalize @xmath3 to get a tropical curve @xmath7 . if the newton subdivision induced by @xmath8 is a triangulation , then @xmath7 will be a graph of genus one and we show in our main result in theorem [ thm : main ] that the lattice length of the cycle of the graph is the negative of the valuation of the @xmath9-invariant .    in the case where the triangulation is _ unimodular _ , i.e.  all the triangles have area @xmath10 , this result was independently derived by david speyer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 9.2 ) using tate uniformization of elliptic curves .",
    "david speyer s result is more general though in the sense that it applies to curves in arbitrary toric varieties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : toricsurfaces ] we consider toric surfaces defined by a marked lattice polygon with one interior point , we recall the classification of these polygons and we consider the impact on the @xmath9-invariant for the corresponding elliptic curves .",
    "section [ sec : tropicalization ] recalls the notion of tropicalization and of plane tropical curves .",
    "we then introduce in section [ sec : jinv ] the notion of tropical @xmath9-invariant and give a formula to compute it .",
    "section [ sec : unimodular ] shows that the tropical @xmath9-invariant is preserved by integral unimodular affine transformations . with this preparation",
    "we are able to state our main result in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "section [ sec : reduction ] is then devoted to the reduction of the proof to considering only three marked polygons and section [ sec : cases ] shows how these three cases can be dealt with using procedures from the singular library ` jinvariant.lib ` ( see @xcite ) which is available via the url    http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~keilen/en/jinvariant.html .",
    "the actual computations are done using ` polymake ` @xcite , topcom @xcite and singular @xcite .",
    "the tropical curves in this paper and their newton subdivisions were produced using the procedure ` drawtropicalcurve ` from the singular library ` tropical.lib ` ( see @xcite ) which can be obtained via the url    http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~keilen/en/tropical.html .",

    "throughout this paper we consider mainly marked polygons @xmath0 such that @xmath11 contains a single interior lattice point , where by a _ marked polygon _ we mean a convex lattice polygon @xmath11 in @xmath12 together with a subset @xmath13 of the lattice points of @xmath11 containing at least the vertices of @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "* section  2.a ) ) . fixing a base field @xmath5",
    "such a polygon defines a polarized _ toric surface _ @xmath14 in the torus @xmath15 the hyperplane section , say @xmath3 , defined by the linear form @xmath16 is the vanishing locus of the laurent polynomial @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "* chapter  5 ) ) . since the arithmetical genus of the hyperplane sections is the number of interior lattice points of @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the general hyperplane section will be a smooth _",
    "elliptic curve_. the _",
    "@xmath9-invariant _ of such a curve is an element of the base field which characterizes the curve up to isomorphism .",
    "an _ integral unimodular affine transformation _ of @xmath12 is an affine map @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 invertible over the integers .",
    "such an integral unimodular affine transformation @xmath21 maps each face of @xmath11 to a face of the convex lattice polygon @xmath22 and preserves thereby the number of lattice points on each face .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 induces an isomorphism of the polarized toric surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "* proposition  5.1.2 ) ) . from the point of view of toric surfaces",
    "it therefore suffices to consider the marked polygon @xmath0 only up to integral unimodular affine transformations , and if we suppose @xmath24 then there are precisely sixteen of them which we divide into two groups , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively @xmath28 ( see figure [ fig : polygons ] , cf .",
