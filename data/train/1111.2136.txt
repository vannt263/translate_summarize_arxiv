    "the diffuse h@xmath0 background is generally believed to originate from the extended , nearly fully ionized regions ( called warm ionized medium , or wim ) along the lines of sight ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) . the volume filling fraction of the wim increases from @xmath1 at the midplane to @xmath2 at @xmath3 kpc @xcite .",
    "the large energy requirement of the wim strongly suggests that o stars in the galactic plane are the primary ionization source @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous investigations about how the lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons can escape the immediate vicinity of the o stars ( or the bright regions ) in the galactic plane and ionize the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "however , the question of how the lyc photons can propagate almost freely up to the scaleheight ( @xmath4 kpc ) of the wim has not been fully resolved because the photoionization models require the presence of very low density paths through the ism .    in this paper",
    ", we explore two alternatives to explain the diffuse h@xmath0 emission of our galaxy .",
    "the first scenario , which was investigated for external galaxies , is that late , field ob stars outside the bright regions ionize some of the wim , reducing the required lyc leakage from the bright regions in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the mean spectral type of stars in the field is later than that in regions @xcite .",
    "as the h@xmath0 intensity is directly proportional to lyc intensity in the ionization bounded regions and the later - type stars would produce a lower ratio of ionizing lyc to non - ionizing far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) luminosities , the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio can constrain the spectral type of the ionizing stars . @xcite and @xcite measured h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratios for 10 nearby spiral galaxies , and concluded that late ob stars in the field are indeed an important source of ionization in those galaxies .    secondly , we note that the majority of the h@xmath0 excess intensity in a number of high - latitude clouds in our galaxy can be understood as light scattered off the interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of scattered h@xmath0 radiation at high - latitude clouds was first considered by @xcite .",
    "photoionization by an external field of lyc is expected to result in ionization of a thin outer shell of an isolated interstellar cloud while the observations of the ha light from the high - latitude clouds clearly showed the dense inner core of the cloud as the brightest feature .",
    "@xcite argued that both a substantial fraction of the diffuse high - latitude h@xmath0 background intensity and much of the variance in the high - latitude h@xmath0 background are due to scattering by interstellar dust of h@xmath0 photons originating elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "if this is the case , the diffuse h@xmath0 emission should be closely related to the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) continuum background , which is mostly dust - scattered light of the fuv stellar radiation @xcite .    therefore , comparison of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission with the fuv continuum background could not only provide a clue to the spectral type of ionizing sources of the wim in our galaxy but also confirm the significance of dust - scattering in the diffuse h@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xcite found a strong correlation between the diffuse fuv ( 13701710 ) and h@xmath0 backgrounds , suggesting a similarity between the origins of both backgrounds . in this paper , we present a more detailed comparison of the galactic h@xmath0 map with the fuv continuum map and propose a scenario on the origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we describe the data used in the present study in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the spectral type of the stars responsible for the diffuse h@xmath0 emission is investigated .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion on the dust - scattering of h@xmath0 photons .",
    "we discuss the main result in section 5 .",
    "a brief summary is presented in section 6 .",
    "the fuv data was obtained by the _ spectroscopy of plasma evolution from astrophysical _ _ radiation ( spear ) _ instruments , also known as _ far ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( fims _ ) @xcite .",
    "the _ spear / fims _ instrument is a dual - channel fuv imaging spectrograph ( `` short '' wavelength channel [ s - band ] 900 - 1150 , `` long '' wavelength channel [ l - band ] 13501750 ; @xmath5 ) with a large field of view ( s - band , @xmath6 ; l - band , @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 imaging resolution onboard the first korean astronomical satellite _ stsat-1 _ , designed to observe diffuse fuv emission .",
    "the _ spear / fims _ survey observations were performed by scanning the sky at constant ecliptic longitude from the north ecliptic pole to the south ecliptic pole , during the eclipses .",
    "the pole - to - pole scanning drifted 360@xmath9 along the ecliptic equator for one year because of the properties of a sun - synchronous orbit .",
    "the mission observed @xmath10% of the sky .",
    "the diffuse fuv map in l - band was obtained by eliminating stars from the total fuv sky map and by binning photon events using the _ hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization ( healpix ) _ tessellation scheme @xcite with @xmath11 pixels ( resolution parameter @xmath12 ) .",
    "we excluded the wavelength regions of the strongest emission lines ( @xmath131398 , @xmath131532 , @xmath141548 , 1551 , and @xmath131671 ) and averaged the data in the wavelength regions of 13701520 , 15601660 , and 16801710 . a detailed description of the fuv continuum map is presented in @xcite .",
    "the all - sky survey maps in h@xmath0 and 100 @xmath15 m were obtained from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the all - sky map of column density is from the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite .",
    "the data interpolated onto a _",
    "projection were obtained from the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
    "figure [ map_ratio ] shows the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio maps obtained by dividing the h@xmath0 intensity with the fuv continuum intensity and smoothed with a spherical gaussian function with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the smoothing was performed using the spherical harmonic transform in the _ healpix _ scheme so to smear the same surface areas in all directions .",
    "we excluded the regions with low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath17 ) and two regions between edges of observing strips centered at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which appeared to produce an artifact with very high h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratios after the smoothing . the fuv and h@xmath0",
    "intensities are expressed in units of rayleighs ( 1 rayleigh [ r ] @xmath20 photons",
    "@xmath21 s@xmath22 sr@xmath22 ) and continuum unit ( 1 cu = photons @xmath21 s@xmath22 sr@xmath22 @xmath22 ) . in the figure , the region with higher h@xmath0/fuv ratio",
    "is represented in blue .",
    "top and bottom panels show the intensity ratio maps before and after dust - extinction correction , respectively . using the standard approach of @xcite for the emitting medium coexisting with dust and the extinction map of @xcite , the correction for dust - extinction was performed for both radiations . in the top panel of the figure ,",
    "it is clear that bright regions have higher h@xmath0/fuv ratios than the diffuse h@xmath0 regions .",
    "correction for dust - extinction lowers the ratio , because the correction for fuv is larger than for ha .",
    "as dust - extinction is stronger at low latitudes , the correction for h ii regions is bigger than for the wim .",
    "therefore , the distinction between the bright and the wim regions becomes less clear after the dust - extinction correction , as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "for the quantitative comparison , the wim regions ( we will use the term wim to denote the diffuse h@xmath0 regions that are not related to the bright regions , regardless of physical origin ) were isolated in the h@xmath0 image using a masking procedure similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 image was smoothed with a median filter using a pixel size of @xmath23 which corresponds approximately to the size of the largest regions .",
    "the smoothed image was subtracted from the original , leaving an image of the small - scale structures only . in other words ,",
    "the smoothly varying component was subtracted . on this image",
    "a mask was created by assigning the value ` 1 ' to the pixels with intensity lower than a prescribed threshold and ` 0 ' to the others .",
    "we tried several threshold values between 0.1 and 50 r as the separation between the wim and regions was rather fuzzy .",
    "the unsmoothed h@xmath0 image was then multiplied by the mask , leaving an image of only the wim .",
    "a wim fuv image was also created using the same mask .",
    "the h@xmath0 and fuv images for regions were created by multiplying the inverted wim mask .",
    "figure [ hist_ratio](a ) shows the histograms of the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratios for the wim and regions in our galaxy , with the thresholds of 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 r. the threshold ` 1 r ' masks most of the regions and ` 20 r ' the brightest ones .",
    "the mean ratios for the regions are generally higher than the mean ratios in the wim .",
    "the difference in the logarithm of the average ratio between the regions and the wim increases smoothly from @xmath24 to @xmath25 dex as the threshold increases from 1 to 20 r. these values are smaller than those found in 10 external galaxies in @xcite , although the largest value of @xmath26 is consistent with the results for ngc 2903 , ngc 5457 , and ngc 1512 within the error ranges .",
    "figure [ hist_ratio](b ) shows the histograms of the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratios after dust - extinction correction .",
    "correction for dust - extinction lowers the difference in the average ratio , as in the bottom panel of figure [ map_ratio ] .",
    "the smaller difference of the mean ratios in our galaxy than those of other galaxies may be attributable to geometrical effects , as the wim and regions overlap in our galaxy while in the face - on external galaxies examined in @xcite and @xcite two regions are better separated from each other .",
    "the field stars in the galactic plane overlapping with regions would lower the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio observed toward the bright regions .",
    "some of the h@xmath0 and fuv photons originating from regions are scattered into high latitudes @xcite .",
    "the dust - scattering of h@xmath0 and fuv photons from the regions to high latitudes would then increase the ratio for the wim , further lowering the difference of the ratios .",
    "furthermore , all the regions are at the same distance in a face - on external galaxy while in the milky way the apparent size of regions is potentially dominated by their distances making the separation more difficult .",
    "therefore , the difference between the regions and the wim in our galaxy may not be significantly different from other galaxies when the galaxy is viewed face - on .    along the top axis of figure [ hist_ratio ]",
    "are shown the stellar spectral types that would yield the corresponding h@xmath0/fuv ratios .",
    "we derived a temperature and effective gravity for given spectral types using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the lyc and fuv photon luminosities @xmath27 and @xmath28 for spectral types of b2o3 stars in the wavebands @xmath29and @xmath30 , respectively , by interpolating on a grid of kurucz models @xcite . the h@xmath0 luminosities @xmath31 equal @xmath32 , assuming case b recombination .",
    "since @xcite covers spectral types only earlier than or equal to b0.5 , we extrapolated the calibration down to b2 .",
    "the temperatures estimated in this way were @xmath33% higher than the values obtained from the older calibration of @xcite .",
    "the extraporation to b2 would be accurate within @xmath34% .",
    "figure [ hist_ratio ] suggests that the difference between the h@xmath0/fuv ratios in the wim and those in the regions is due to the difference in main ionizing sources .",
    "an interesting result in figure [ hist_ratio ] is that the median value of the observed ratios in the wim corresponds to a value predictable from @xmath35 o9  b0 stars with effective temperatures of @xmath35 35,000 k. @xcite modeled the wim as a combination of overlapping regions and found that typical values of the line ratios [ ] @xmath136716/h@xmath0 @xmath36 , [ ] @xmath136583/h@xmath0 @xmath37 , [ ] @xmath136300/h@xmath0 @xmath38 , [ ] @xmath135007/h@xmath0 @xmath39 , and @xmath135876/h@xmath0 @xmath40 observed in the galactic wim can be well reproduced by an ionizing spectrum of a star with @xmath41 k ; @xcite also found that the wim observations best agree with @xmath42 k. the results are consistent with the h@xmath0/fuv ratios , thereby strongly supporting that the h@xmath0 emission originates from late ob - type stars .",
    "the optical line ratios will be discussed more in section 5 .",
    "we also note that the h@xmath0/fuv ratio has a well - defined limiting value corresponding to b2 stars , meaning that the latest stellar type that is capable of ionizing the wim may be about b2 .",
    "the mean h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio after and before the dust - extinction correction as a function of h@xmath0 intensity is shown together with the standard deviation of ratios from the mean value for a given h@xmath0 intensity inverval in figure [ ratio_vs_others](a ) .",
    "uncertainty of the ratio toward an individual sightline is much smaller than the deviation of ratios .",
    "red and black symbols represent the intensity ratio before and after the dust - extinction correction , respectively .",
    "there is a general trend for the average ratio to increase with the h@xmath0 intensity , although it scatters a lot .",
    "both the general trend and large scatter are qualitatively similar to those found in the external galaxies in @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the ratio tends to increase with the h@xmath0 intensity . at low latitudes and highest h@xmath0 intensities ,",
    "the h@xmath0 radiation may be dominated by recombination lines originated from regions around early o - type stars , while the fuv background is from dust - scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore , a much wider range of variability in the h@xmath0 intensity and the h@xmath0/fuv ratio is found . on the other hand , at high latitudes and low values of h@xmath0 intensity , much of the structure in the faint h@xmath0 background",
    "may have the same origin as that of the fuv background and the variation of h@xmath0/fuv decreases .",
    "in other words , the h@xmath0 contribution from dust - scattering becomes increasingly important at higher latitudes .",
    "a similar feature was found in figure 21 of @xcite , where a linear correlation of the h@xmath0 intensity with the fuv intensity was found only in low intensities .",
    "in addition , at lowest h@xmath0 intensities , only early b - type stars would contribute to both backgrounds and the ratio would then converge to a single value .",
    "the converged value corresponds to a spectral type of b0  b1 .",
    "interestingly , line ratios [ /h@xmath0 and [ /h@xmath0 , and the h@xmath0/fuv ratio show a similar trend with decreasing h@xmath0 intensity , except the line ratios increase while the h@xmath0/fuv ratio decreases .",
    "mean values of the optical line ratios increase with decreasing h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "the ratios also show large scatter as the h@xmath0/fuv ratio does .",
    "the mean h@xmath0/fuv ratio decreases rapidly below h@xmath0 intensity of @xmath43 r with decreasing h@xmath0 intensity in figure [ ratio_vs_others](a ) .",
    "the mean line ratios increase most dramatically below the same h@xmath0 intensity ( @xmath43 r ) ( figures 6 , 12 , and 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "the similar trend in both the optical line ratios and the h@xmath0/fuv ratio @xmath44may be understood as an increasing contribution of late ob stars to the wim as the h@xmath0 intensity decreases .",
    "we also plotted the hardness ratio in fuv wavelengths versus the h@xmath0/fuv ratio as the fuv hardness ratio might also provide an additional clue on the spectral type of the ionizing source of the wim .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined as the ratio of average intensities at @xmath45and @xmath46 , excluding the bright , , and emission lines , as in @xcite .",
    "we found an overall correlation between the fuv hardness ratio with the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio , as shown in figure [ ratio_vs_others](b ) , where the standard deviation of the fuv hardness ratios from its mean value for a given h@xmath0/fuv bin is also indicated .",
    "the mean fuv hardness ratio shows rather rapid decrease below the h@xmath0/fuv @xmath4 ( r/@xmath47 cu ) , corresponding to the approximate mean value of the h@xmath0/fuv ratio of the wim .",
    "@xcite found that a map of the hardness ratio of 13701520  to 15601710band intensity shows that the sky is divided into roughly two parts , which are determined by the longitudinal distribution of ob - type stars in the galactic plane .",
    "therefore , the correlation between the fuv hardness ratio and a large portion , if not all , of the h@xmath0/fuv ratio supports that the diffuse h@xmath0 background is produced by relatively late - type stars rather than regions in the galactic plane .",
    "statistically significant correlation coefficients of 0.9 and 0.8 for figure [ ratio_vs_others](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , were obtained .",
    "we also note that most of the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratios are so concentrated to ~ 1 ( r/10@xmath48 cu ) , as can be noted in figure [ hist_ratio ] , that the two - dimensional histograms and/or contours as in figure [ ha_vs_others ] show strong peaks at the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio of ~ 1 ( r/10@xmath48 cu ) . therefore , the average intensity ratio versus the abscissa in figure [ ratio_vs_others ] was the best way to represent clearly the correlations .",
    "we note that the h@xmath0/fuv ratio map ( figure [ map_ratio ] ) does not match perfectly with the fuv hardness ratio map ( figure 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the maps generally correlate well with each other , except a few regions such as near @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite compared the observed h@xmath0/fuv ratios with the theoretical calculations assuming that the fuv photons are emitted from unresolved point sources in the observed regions . however , fuv photons are well scattered by interstellar dust grains to large distances and the diffuse fuv emission is wide - spread over regions where no point sources are present @xcite . the fuv intensity used in the analysis of face - on galaxies",
    "would be produced by in - situ point sources as well as dust - scattered light in the regions , whereas the fuv data in the present study is dominated by dust - scattered light originating from late o- and early b - type stars @xcite .",
    "we also note that the spectral type of dominant radiation source of the fuv continuum background is consistent with that inferred from h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio",
    ".    it would be interesting to estimate how a large portion of the ionizing power required for the h@xmath0 background can be provided by late ob stars .",
    "if the h@xmath0 emission originates from ionized gas in a plane - parallel geometry , the hydrogen recombination rate @xmath50 per @xmath51 of galactic disk in the vicinity of the sun is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the h@xmath0 intensity at galactic latitude @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "using an approximate h@xmath0 intensity distribution @xmath55 r , which was obtained from rather limited observations , reynolds obtained @xmath56 s@xmath22 @xmath21 .",
    "however , using the result of @xcite obtained from the full wim observations , the distribution of h@xmath0 at high latitudes is fitted on average by @xmath57 r ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a lower recombination rate of @xmath58 s@xmath22 @xmath21 .",
    "the lyc luminosities per @xmath51 of the galactic disk estimated for the solar neighborhood are @xmath59 and @xmath60 photons s@xmath22 @xmath21 for o and b stars , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fraction of lyc luminosity of o9 and o9.5 stars in total lyc luminosity due to o stars is @xmath61% @xcite .",
    "the lyc luminosity from the stars later than or equal to o9 would then be @xmath62 photons s@xmath22 @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , late ob stars are able to account for at least one - half of the required ionizing power .",
    "in fact , @xcite considered the intensity of the h@xmath0 background at @xmath63 and concluded that isolated regions surrounding early b stars could account for up to one - half of the observed h@xmath0 background in some regions of the galactic plane .",
    "he predicted that near the galactic poles , b star regions would account for a mean h@xmath0 intensity of @xmath1 r. this result is consistent with our estimation .",
    "the late ob - type stars may not have enough power to produce the whole h@xmath0 background if the h@xmath0 photons originate purely from ionized gas around late ob stars , as noted by @xcite and in section 3 .",
    "however , if dust - scattering plays an important role , the dust - scattered h@xmath0 photons originating from the sources other than o stars in bright regions would contribute a larger portion to the h@xmath0 background at high - latitudes and the severe requirement of lyc leakage from regions in the midplane may be potentially alleviated . in this section ,",
    "we examine how the contribution of dust - scattering could be significant in the h@xmath0 background .",
    "galactic observables may generally correlate with each other because of the general property of a plane - parallel ism .",
    "the correlation between a pair of galactic quantities would be enhanced when their sources and radiative transfer mechanisms are analogous .",
    "if a large portion of the diffuse h@xmath0 intensity is due to dust - scattering , the h@xmath0 intensity would show a better correlation with fuv intensity than that with other quantities , such as neutral hydrogen column density @xmath64 ( ) . on the other hand , if the radiative transfer mechanism for the diffuse h@xmath0 emission is not related with the dust - scattering , the correlation between the h@xmath0 and fuv intensities would not be improved .",
    "figure [ ha_vs_others ] shows the correlation plots of h@xmath0 intensity with 100 @xmath15 m dust emission and column density @xmath64 ( ) in the same forms of two - dimensional histograms and contours as in figure 21 of @xcite , in which the fuv intensity is compared with 100 @xmath15 m intensity , @xmath64 ( ) , and h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "correlation coefficients estimated in logarithmic scale are also shown in the figure .",
    "we find that the correlation of h@xmath0 intensity with fuv ( shown in figure 21(c ) of @xcite ) is a bit better , at least qualitatively , than with the others ism tracers shown in figure [ ha_vs_others ] .",
    "the correlation relations with 100 @xmath15 m intensity and @xmath64 ( ) are a bit curved and flaring , whereas the correlation with the fuv background is quite straight .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient between the h@xmath0 and fuv backgrounds is not significantly higher than the other correlation coefficients .",
    "the fact that the correlation coefficients show no significant differences may be caused by large scatter in the correlation relations and the general similarity in the latitude dependence of the data sets ( the column density , 100 @xmath15 m , h@xmath0 , and fuv intensities ) .",
    "although the h@xmath0 emissivity and column density have different dependences on the gas density , their latitude dependences have the same trend with inverse-@xmath65 if they arise in plane - parallel geometries .",
    "the inverse-@xmath65 dependence of the data sets dominates the correlations in figure [ ha_vs_others ] . to reduce the latitude dependence and scatter",
    ", we therefore plotted the average intensities multiplied by @xmath65 versus @xmath65 within each of the @xmath66 latitude intervals for @xmath64 ( ) , 100 @xmath15 m , h@xmath0 , and fuv intensities in figure [ sinb ] . in the figure ,",
    "the curves were paired and arbitrarily moved to compare the shapes .",
    "the top two curves compare the @xmath64 ( ) and 100 @xmath15 m emission .",
    "the middle and bottom pairs show the variations of h@xmath0 and fuv intensities after and before dust - extinction correction , respectively . the @xmath64 ( ) and",
    "100 @xmath15 m emission are well described by the plane - parallel or inverse-@xmath65 law , whereas h@xmath0 and fuv intensities deviate from the law .",
    "the deviation of h@xmath0 and fuv intensities from the inverse-@xmath65 law is mainly attributable to the effect of dust absorption and scattering .",
    "a radiative transfer model of diffuse galactic light in plane - parallel dust layer shows the similar dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath65 as in the bottom curves of figure [ sinb ] ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that the inverse-@xmath65 equation of the h@xmath0 intensity described in section 3 is still a good approximation because of the major dependence of the h@xmath0 intensity on inverse-@xmath65 , especially at high latitudes , even @xmath67 is not a constant in figure [ sinb ] .",
    "we note from the bottom two curves before dust - extinction correction that the dependences of the h@xmath0 and fuv backgrounds on the galactic latitude are very similar at high latitudes ( @xmath68 ) ( see also figure 13 of @xcite and figure 9 of @xcite ) , whereas at low latitudes ( @xmath69 ) they show a difference .",
    "stronger dust - extinction in fuv would suppress the fuv intensity near the galactic plane , as shown in low latitudes .",
    "we therefore corrected the dust - extinction as denoted by the middle two curves ( red and black solid lines for h@xmath0 and fuv , respectively ) .",
    "the dust - extinction correction for both backgrounds was performed using the standard approach of @xcite .",
    "the variations of both backgrounds are remarkably similar to each other .",
    "the fuv radiation can be emitted even from late b - type stars , whereas the h@xmath0 emission requires excitation from earlier stars .",
    "therefore , the scaleheight of the fuv sources is a bit higher than that of the h@xmath0 sources . on the other hands",
    ", ionized regions must be more extended than point sources for the fuv photons , and the dust - scattered h@xmath0 originating from regions should be more extended than those from point sources .",
    "accordingly , the dependences of both backgrounds on the galactic latitude are very similar even at low latitudes , after extinction corrections are applied .    in figure [ correlation_sinb ]",
    ", we also examine correlations of the diffuse h@xmath0 intensity with @xmath64 ( ) , 100 @xmath15 m emission , and the diffuse fuv background after the removal of inverse-@xmath65 dependence . in the correlation plot",
    ", we used only the latitude range of @xmath68 to avoid the strong dust - extinction effect .",
    "red and black symbols represent the data points after and before the dust - extinction correction , respectively .",
    "the figure also shows correlation coefficients .",
    "it is obvious that the correlation with the fuv background is now significantly stronger than the correlations with others . in @xcite , we compared the fuv continuum background with other ism tracers and found that the fuv intensity correlates better with the h@xmath0 intensity than with others .",
    "the two - photon emission in the wim is unlikely to be the cause of the strong correlation between the h@xmath0 and fuv backgrounds @xcite .",
    "we are therefore convinced of the result that a significant portion of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission at high latitudes is dust - scattered light originated from elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "we now estimate the fraction of dust - scattered h@xmath0 emission . @xcite",
    "derived two equations ( equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) ) relating the fuv intensity to 100 @xmath15 m and h@xmath0 emissions at high latitudes . since the constant terms in the relations are often regarded as extragalactic background , they should be identical .",
    "the difference between the constant terms is indeed negligible .",
    "therefore , the relation between the 100 @xmath15 m and h@xmath0 emission are given by @xmath44@xmath70 mjy / sr .",
    "@xcite provides an empirical relation , which relates the scattered h@xmath0 intensity to the 100 @xmath15 m emission at high latitudes . using these relations",
    ", we obtain an average ratio of the scattered h@xmath0 intensity to total intensity , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , in general , about 37% of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission at high latitudes would be due to dust - scattering .",
    "contribution of the lyc leakage from bright regions may be @xmath3513% on average if late ob stars produce about half of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "however , these numbers should be referenced with caution",
    ". the scattered portion can be much higher or lower depending on location , as shown in @xcite .",
    "since the fuv background traces the dust - scattered light , we expect that the fuv to h@xmath0 ratio would be more or less proportional to the scattered fraction of h@xmath0 background .",
    "we note that the scattered fraction of h@xmath0 background shown in figure 5 of @xcite is more or less anti - correlated with the h@xmath0/fuv ratio map of figure [ map_ratio ] , verifying the expectation .",
    "by combing the previous results , we propose that most of the diffuse h@xmath0 background at high latitudes may originate from relatively late o- and early b - stars outside the bright regions and from dust - scattered h@xmath0 photons from elsewhere in the milky way . the observed h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio in general increases with the h@xmath0 intensity , indicating that late ob stars could be important contributors to the diffuse h@xmath0 .",
    "as suggested by the strong correlation between the diffuse h@xmath0 and fuv backgrounds , dust - scattering may widely spread out the h@xmath0 recombination photons into regions where there is no ionizing source .",
    "the present scenario is able to explain the line ratios observed in the wim much more easily than or equally as well as the photoionization models .",
    "the higher [ @xmath136716/h@xmath0 and [ @xmath136583/h@xmath0 line ratios observed in the diffuse h@xmath0 regions compared to those in regions have been believed to be the strongest evidence against the theory of a dust - scattering origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "however , we have to note that the argument has been based solely on comparison with the line ratios from the bright regions .",
    "if the line ratios from the ionized regions due to the late - type ob stars are compared with the line ratios in the wim , the present scenario seems to explain the trend equally as well as the previous photoionization models do .",
    "as already noted in section 3 , mean values of [ /h@xmath0 and [ /h@xmath0 intensity ratios in the diffuse h@xmath0 regions are well reproduced with late ob stars @xcite .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite shows that the [ /h@xmath0 ratios observed in regions around late - type stars are higher than those found around earlier - type stars .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that the similarity of the line ratios between the barnard s loop , the orion - eridanus bubble , and the typical wim samples is striking and probably indicates a common set of their physical conditions .",
    "the ionizing stars of the barnard s loop are o9.5 and o9 types .",
    "they found that the photoionization models with the ionization parameter @xmath72 and the stellar temperature @xmath73 k  40,000 k fully enclose the space of [ /h@xmath0 versus [ /h@xmath0 occupied by barnard s loop , the orion - eridaunus bubble , and the wim samples .",
    "it is also noticeable that most of the wim samples in their figure 7 occupies the region defined by a stellar temperature lower than 40,000 k , probably @xmath35 35,000 k. another interesting fact to note is that the elemental abundances required to explain the line ratios in the wim are close to the b star abundances both in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "these results strongly support the late ob star origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission .",
    "weak [ @xmath135007/h@xmath0 and @xmath135876/h@xmath0 emission line ratios also indicate that the spectrum of the diffuse interstellar radiation field is significantly softer than that from the average galactic o star population @xcite .",
    "the increase of the line ratios [ /h@xmath0 and [ /h@xmath0 can be understood as a significant ioninzation contribution by late ob stars to the wim .",
    "however , their highest values observed in the wim may need other non - ionizing heating sources , such as shocks , photoelectric heating , and/or turbulent mixing layers @xcite",
    ". other heating sources may include cooling , falling galactic fountain gas initially raised from the midplane by supernovae and microflares from magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the pure photoionization models by o - type stars in the midplane also need additional heating sources to explain the highest ratios @xcite .",
    "the emission lines due to the heating sources that provide the highest line ratios would also be scattered into more extended regions than those originally produced by the heating / ionizing sources .",
    "therefore , the dust - scattering will hamper the clear identification of the original ionization sources .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the [ / [ ratio is almost independent of ionizing stellar temperature but depends on the ionization parameter .",
    "the photoionization models explain the enhanced [ /h@xmath0 line ratios by a diluted radiation field and thus the lowered ionization parameter .",
    "hence the models can not reproduce the observed constancy of the [ / [ ratios . instead , the dust - scattering scenario can naturally explain the constancy of the line ratios .",
    "dust scattering has a significant impact on line ratios which are used to determine physical properties of regions @xcite .",
    "scattered light is enhanced at shorter wavelengths , which can lead to observed balmer line ratios that are theoretically impossible .",
    "this effect can also lead to overestimates of the electron temperatures derived from the auroral and nebular line ratios of forbidden lines , such as [ @xmath135755 / [ @xmath136583 which has been used to derive the temperature of the wim .",
    "serious discrepancies between the h@xmath0 intensity and radio and/or ir intensities could be found when a large portion of the h@xmath0 intensity is due to dust - scattering .",
    "this effect was found in the extended orion nebula ( eon ) . @xcite",
    "combined 327.5 mhz radio observations and optical spectroscopy to study conditions in the eon .",
    "they found an increase in the ratio of emission measures derived from the h@xmath74 line and the 327.5 mhz radio continuum with increasing distance from the dominant photoionizing star @xmath75 ori c , indicating the increasing contribution of a dust - scattering component to the h@xmath74 intensity with the distance .",
    "recent observations using the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ have found that the ratio of the free - free radio continuum to h@xmath0 is surprisingly low in the wim @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a three - component model consisting of a mix of ( 1 ) hot gas currently being photoionized , ( 2 ) gas that is recombining and cooling after removal of a photoionizing source , and ( 3 ) cold gas . in the standard model for explaining the observed intensity ratios of the free - free radio continuum to h@xmath0 and [ @xmath136583 to h@xmath0",
    ", they assumed that the scattered fraction of the h@xmath0 originating from the hot gas is 20% .",
    "the fractions of the hot , cooling , and gases were found to be 22 , 56 , and 2% , respectively .",
    "the model predicted that the photoionization should switch off and the gas begins to cool and recombine in a much shorter time ( @xmath76 yr ) than o star lifetimes ( @xmath77 yr ) .",
    "such a short photoionization time scale is rather surprising in that o stars have been generally favored as the source of ionization for the wim .",
    "they therefore suggested that the ionizing radiation for the wim may be provided in large part by runaway o and b stars , with space velocities @xmath78 km s@xmath22 . in the analysis",
    ", they assumed the [ /h@xmath0 line ratio of @xmath79 for the wim , which is well reproduced by late ob - type stars @xcite .",
    "the ratio of free - free to h@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath80 kjy sr@xmath22 r@xmath22 for the wim with a temperature of 8000 k ( equation ( 11 ) in @xcite ) , which is about 1.9 times larger than the observed ratio of 0.085 kjy sr@xmath22 r@xmath22 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath3537% of the observed h@xmath0 intensity is from dust - scattering and the temperature of the wim is 8000 k , the fractions of the hot and cooling gases are found to be @xmath3544% and @xmath3518% , respectively .",
    "the wim is thought to have a temperature 2000 k higher than the bright classical regions @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found no evidence that the wim components have a systematically higher temperature than the well known higher - density regions .",
    "as already noted , the temperature derived from [ @xmath135755 / [ @xmath136583 may be uncertain .",
    "temperature of the barnard s loop is found to be @xmath81 k @xcite . from the similarity of the physical conditions between the barnard s loop and the typical wim sample",
    ", we may assume an extreme case that the temperature of the wim is @xmath82 k , and there is no contribution from either cooling or cold gas .",
    "the assumptions may be rather extreme , but still plausible at some sightlines since the physical conditions and constribution of dust scattering in individual sightlines would generally differ from the average and vary from sightline to sightline @xcite .",
    "the free - free to h@xmath0 ratio of @xmath83 is then obtained , which agrees with the observed ratio .",
    "therefore , relatively late o and/or early b - type stars , as proposed in the present study , appear to explain the observed values of not only optical line ratios but also free - free to h@xmath0 intensity ratios even without considering a significant contribution of either cooling or cold gas .",
    "however , we emphasize that the aim of this study is to explain averaged observational results and our results do not indicate that all the diffuse h@xmath0 emission is produced by late ob stars outside bright regions and dust scattering .",
    "large scatter found in figure [ ratio_vs_others ] also indicates that not only the physical conditions and contributions of various components ( dust - scattered component , hot and cooling gases ) but also the ionizing and/or heating sources of the wim vary significantly from sightline to sightline .",
    "low extinction at 2.17 @xmath15 m br@xmath84 emission line should allow to probe the wim throughout the galactic plane . a pilot survey of the br@xmath84 emission carried out using the goddard - wisconsin near - ir cryogenic spectrometer revealed that the volume filling fraction of the br@xmath84-emitting medium is typically around 1% , indicating the br@xmath84 emission is likely related to more compact sources @xcite .",
    "if the lyc photons are indeed leaked out of the bright regions in the galactic plane and photoionize the surrounding medium to produce the diffuse h@xmath0 emission , as usually supposed , the filling fraction of the br@xmath84-emitting gas in the galactic plane should be equal to or higher than the filling fraction of @xmath3510% obtained by the h@xmath0 observations @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy strongly suggests that the lyc leaked out of bright regions is unlikely the major source of the diffuse h@xmath0 background and a significant portion of the h@xmath0 background originates from dust - scattering .",
    "more detailed observations using hydrogen recombination lines in the near - ir wavelenths , such as pa@xmath0 ( 1.87 @xmath15 m ) , br@xmath0 ( 4.05 @xmath15 m ) , and br@xmath84 , would be needed to understand the origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the multi - purpose infra - red imaging system ( miris ) is being developed to survey the galactic plane at pa@xmath0 emission line , which may help to understand the origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "the volume filling fraction and scaleheight of the wim were estimated from the assumption that the pulsar dispersion measure and the h@xmath0 photons probe the same ionized medium . however , as a large portion of the diffuse h@xmath0 background at high latitudes may be the result of dust - scattering , the filling fraction and scaleheight must be reexamined .",
    "we also found that some of the small - scale features in the fuv sky coincided with the ha sky , but not always .",
    "a detailed examination of small - scale correlation between the h@xmath0 and fuv background , which should provide better understanding of the origin of the diffuse h@xmath0 emission , will be presented in the future .",
    "assuming the conventional photoionization models of the h@xmath0 background , the ism may have low - density paths and voids that allow for ionizing photons from midplane ob stars to reach and ionize gas many kiloparsecs above the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "pathways that provide lower than average densities to high latitudes could enhance both scattered fuv and gas ionized by the lyc from the same ob stars in the galactic plane .",
    "stars that can reproduce most of the fuv continuum background in the radiative transfer models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are located within only a few hundred pc from the sun .",
    "fuv photons are predominantly scattered in the forward direction @xcite , implying that dust - scattering occurs mostly in between the observer and the source .",
    "preliminary results from our monte - carlo 3d radiative transfer models for the fuv continuum background indicate that most of the fuv continuum background originates from stars and dust located within a volume with a size of @xmath851 kpc centered at the sun ( seon et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 photons of the wim are thought to originate within 23 kpc distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that lyc photons would also originate from a volume within a few kpc . in this regard",
    ", we note that the dust - scattering cross - section at 1550  is @xmath86 times lower than the photoionization cross - section at 912  @xcite , assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this suggests that fuv photons should originate from much ( probably @xmath87 times ) larger volume than h@xmath0 photons , which is in contrast with the radiative transfer models of the fuv continuum background .",
    "meanwhile , the dust - scattering cross - section for h@xmath0 photons is lower than that for fuv ( 1550  ) by a factor of @xmath88 @xcite , indicating that dust - scattering of the fuv photons will occur at closer distances than h@xmath0 photons .",
    "therefore , the dust - scattering of h@xmath0 photons provide a much easier way to explain the diffuse h@xmath0 background than the conventional photoionization models .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath0 intensity from midplane regions that is scattered by dust at high latitudes is in the range 5 - 20% of the total intensity .",
    "however , we should note that in - situ h@xmath0 recombination photons at high latitudes would be also scattered and this component was not included in the estimation . in figure 3 of @xcite ,",
    "the scattered h@xmath0 intensity that is originating from the wim through in - situ recombination is compatible with the scattered light from bright regions ( point sources ) at some high latitudes , indicating higher fraction of dust scattering than 5 - 20% .",
    "moreover , as noted in @xcite , the highly structured distribution in the ratio of h@xmath0 scattering to h@xmath0 in situ emission was not accounted for in the model of @xcite .",
    "the dust - scattered light of in - situ h@xmath0 emission ( originating mostly from late ob - type stars ) at high latitudes , and the complex structures of the ism and ionizing sources may result in a higher fraction of dust - scattering than predicted by the simplistic calculation .",
    "if late ob stars produce about half of the diffuse h@xmath0 intensity , the dust - scattered fraction of the h@xmath0 intensity is more or less at the same level as that due to in - situ recombination .",
    "the direct fuv starlight and the diffuse fuv background were found to contribute approximately the same amounts to the total fuv intensity on average @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the dust - scattered fractions between the fuv continuum and h@xmath0 backgrounds supports again the idea wherein their sources and radiative transfer mechanisms are similar .",
    "in summary , we found that the h@xmath0/fuv intensity ratio increases with the h@xmath0 intensity and fuv hardness ratio , implying that late ob - type stars mostly produce the diffuse ha at high latitudes .",
    "we also found that the h@xmath0 correlates with the fuv background very well .",
    "the correlations strongly suggest that a large portion of the diffuse h@xmath0 photons originate from late ob - type stars and dust - scattering .",
    "we therefore propose a scenario wherein both late ob - type stars and dust - scattering play significant roles in the diffuse h@xmath0 emission . the h@xmath0 background at high galactic latitudes",
    "may mostly originate from late ob stars existing outside the bright regions and dust - scattering of the h@xmath0 photons .",
    "the proposed scenario appears to reproduce most of the observed line ratios , such as average values of [ /h@xmath0 , [ /h@xmath0 , [ /h@xmath0 and /h@xmath0 , and free - free to h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "their extreme values may need additional heating sources , as is also needed in the pure photoionization models .",
