    "the standard model ( sm ) is in spectacular agreement with all known experiments .",
    "however , it is almost certainly fundamentally incomplete . the solar @xcite , atmosphere @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments have provided us very convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed . besides , precisely cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic cold dark matter : @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these two important discoveries can not be accommodated in the sm without introducing extra ingredients .",
    "a possible extension of the sm is to add three right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath2 so that light neutrino masses can be generated by the famous canonical seesaw mechanism ( i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dirac mass matrix linking left - handed light neutrinos to right - handed heavy neutrinos and @xmath5 is the mass matrix of @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is the so - called type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "actually , there are three types of tree - level seesaw mechanisms @xcite and three types of loop - level seesaw mechanisms @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the seesaw mechanism is that they can both explain neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe with the help of leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "putting some discrete flavor symmetry on the seesaw mechanism , heavy seesaw particles can also serve as cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "this builds a bridge between the dark matter and neutrino physics .",
    "we do not have enough information on the detailed nature of cdm , except for its relic density .",
    "there are major experimental efforts for direct and indirect detection of dark matter particle beside the gravitational effect that it has on the universe , because they must have some connection to the sm particles .",
    "a direct detection probes the scattering of dark matter off nuclei in the dark matter detectors , while indirect detection investigate the sm final states from the annihilation of the dark matter by cosmic ray detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possible extension of the sm to include lepton number(l ) as local gauge symmetry .",
    "two reasons drive us to investigate this possibility :    * baryon number(b ) and l are accidental global symmetries in the sm .",
    "b must be broken to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "l should be broken to accommodate the majorana masses of active neutrinos .",
    "investigating the possibility of l as spontaneously broken local gauge symmetry would help us to study the origin of small neutrino masses and describe the seesaw scale .",
    "* recent results from pamela@xcite and fermi@xcite suggest there should be pure leptonic interactions for dark matter to explain the @xmath6 excesses observed by these experiments .",
    "inspired by ref.@xcite , we investigate the case dark matter being charged under l , which is taken as local gauge symmetry .",
    "we extend the sm with three right - handed majorana neutrinos , two generation fermions doublet as well as pure leptonic gauge symmetry @xmath7 and @xmath0 discrete flavor symmetry . in this model ,",
    "all the quarks have zero @xmath8 charge , while all the leptons ( including right - handed neutrinos ) have unit @xmath8 charge .",
    "after @xmath8 gauge symmetry spontaneously broken , right - handed neutrinos acquire heavy majorana masses , while three active neutrinos may acquire non - zero majorana masses through the modified type - ii seesaw mechanism . due to the @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "right - handed majorana neutrinos do nt couple to the sm fermions , so that they can be cold dark matter candidate .",
    "we study constraints on our model from neutrino physics and electroweak precision measurements .",
    "we also investigate constraints on the leptonic gauge coupling constant and the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino from the dark matter relic abundance .",
    "the paper is organized as following : section ii is a brief introduction to the setup of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry . in section iii and section iv , we study constraints on our model from the neutrino physics and electroweak precision measurements . in section",
    "v , we investigate the possibility of taking the lightest right - handed neutrino as cold dark matter .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "now we consider the extension of the sm with three right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath10 , two generation fermions doublet @xmath11 , @xmath12 and singlet @xmath13 , @xmath14 as well as new gauge symmetry @xmath7 and @xmath0 discrete flavor symmetry .",
    "to generate majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos , one higgs singlet @xmath15 with @xmath16 charge @xmath17 is added to the model . due to the @xmath0 discrete symmetry , right - handed neutrinos",
    "do not couple to the sm particles , such that they can serve as cold dark matter candidate .",
    "we also include one higgs triplet @xmath18 with @xmath7 charge @xmath19 in our model , so that small but non - zero neutrino masses can be generated through the modified type - ii seesaw mechanism .",

    "then the neutral component of @xmath43 is stable and can be dark matter candidate .",
    "however , @xmath43 is strongly coupled to the sm higgs boson in our model , i.e. , @xmath44(of course it should be smaller than @xmath45 to satisfy the perturbativity limit@xcite ) . assuming @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we can estimate the relic density of @xmath43 : @xmath48 , which is quite small compared with the dark matter relic density , even smaller than its statistical error .",
    "therefore the contribution of @xmath43 to the dark matter relic density is almost ignorable . for simplification , we will not discuss the phenomenology of @xmath43 in this paper .",
    "we now investigate the possible origin of majorana masses for three active neutrinos in our model .",
    "conventional seesaw mechanisms explicitly break the lepton number , which is gauged and spontaneously broken in our model . to overcome this difficulty , we modify the type - ii seesaw mechanism slightly .",
