    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most luminous steady objects in the universe with power output ranging from @xmath6erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "the spectra of agn generally consist of the following components : a big blue bump , a primary x - ray continuum with a high energy cut - off , a soft x - ray excess , blurred reflection and absorption ( neutral or ionized ) .",
    "the big blue bump is thought to arise from the accretion disc .",
    "the thermal emission from the standard accretion disc is a combination of blackbody radiation with different temperatures that depend upon the size of the emitting region @xmath8 , mass accretion rate @xmath9 and the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass @xmath10 .",
    "the peak emission from the standard accretion disc in nearby agn falls in the far or extreme uv band @xcite and is generally not observable due to the photoelectric absorption in our galaxy as well as in the host galaxy .",
    "this has caused a major obstacle in our understanding of the nature of the accretion disc in agn .",
    "it is not clearly known if agn host the standard geometrically thin and optically thick disc as modelled by @xcite .",
    "the primary x - ray emission is believed to be produced by inverse compton scattering of the optical / uv disc photons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has variously been proposed that the scattering region could be a hot corona above the cold disc @xcite , an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) @xcite or a relativistic jet or base of the jet @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the corona could be of the form of a ` slab ' or ` sandwich ' @xcite , ` sphere+disc geometries ' @xcite or it could be a ` patchy corona ' @xcite . a large fraction of agn show an excess emission over the power - law continuum below @xmath11  kev .",
    "the origin of this soft excess ( @xmath12  kev ) is not clear .",
    "it may arise due to the thermal comptonization of the disc photons in a low temperature optically thick medium @xcite or blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the broad iron k@xmath13 line ( @xmath14  kev ) and a compton reflection hump ( @xmath15  kev ) are the main ingredients of the blurred reflection component .",
    "the nuclear emission is generally affected by neutral or ionized absorbers that may cover the nuclear source fully or partially and may be outflowing , such as the winds from the accretion disc or ` pc - scale torus ' @xcite .",
    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1s ) galaxies are a subclass of seyfert 1 galaxies with relatively narrow balmer lines fwhm(h@xmath16 ) @xmath17  km  s@xmath7 @xcite , strong permitted optical / uv fe ii emission lines @xcite , weaker [ oiii ] emission @xmath18\\lambda5007}{h_{\\beta}}\\leq3 $ ] @xcite , steep soft x - ray spectra @xcite , rapid x - ray variability @xcite , and smaller black hole masses @xcite which partially accounts for their high eddington ratios @xmath19 @xcite . by virtue of their smaller black hole masses and high accretion rates ,",
    "nls1s are useful laboratories of an earlier stage of black hole mass build - up in agn , also corroborated by the higher incidence of ` pseudo - bulges ' in their host galaxies @xcite .    in the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of agn ranging from radio to gamma rays ,",
    "the disc emission usually peaks in the optical / uv regime .",
    "radio - loud agn generally exhibit collimated jets , sometimes dominating the emission from the disc / corona .",
    "the fundamental plane of black hole activity suggests that there exists a correlation between jet power , disc power and black hole mass @xcite .",
    "therefore physical processes governing the disc - accretion and the jet launching mechanism are universal across mass scales .",
    "although there is a phenomenological understanding of the disc - jet paradigm in black - hole x - ray binaries , the disc - jet connection is not well established for agn . despite many efforts to understand radiative processes in large scale radio jets ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the role of the innermost disc / corona region for the ejection of jets is not clearly understood in agn .",
    "the aim of this work is to disentangle the disc / corona and jet emission and characterise the accretion disc emission by modelling the multiband ( optical / uv and x - ray ) data .",
    "the radio - loud narrow line seyfert 1 ( rlnls1 ) galaxies are similar to the radio - quiet nls1s except for their radio - loudness and are useful laboratories to study the formation of jets and their connection with the disc / corona .",

    "we have derived a disc temperature of @xmath119  ev for rxj1633.3 + 4719 by using the disc model diskpn for the soft excess . in case of a standard accretion disc , the local effective temperature @xcite at radius @xmath120",

    "when a black hole of mass @xmath125 accretes matter at its eddington limit , the standard disc temperature is expected to be @xmath126  ev for a non - rotating black hole and @xmath127  ev for a maximally rotating kerr black hole .",
    "the eddington luminosity can be written as    @xmath128    for @xmath129 @xcite , the eddington luminosity is @xmath130 .",

    "]      as shown above , the ultra - soft excess emission from rxj1633.3 + 4719 is consistent with an accretion disc origin .",
    "however , the accretion disc component can not explain the excess emission in uv and we need an additional steep power - law for the uv continuum .",
    "we have examined the strongest emission lines present in the om bands ",
    "uvm2 ( @xmath143 ) , uvw1(@xmath144 ) and u ( @xmath145 ) . from the composite quasar spectrum @xcite , we find that the total equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines in the uvm2 , uvw1 and u bands are @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively , which are much narrower than the widths of the broadband om uv filters .",
    "therefore , the excess uv emission from rxj1633.3 + 4719 can not be due to the contribution of the emission lines .",
    "to understand whether the uv emission ( om bandpass ) is from the accretion disc or jet , we estimate the optical - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath149 which is defined as    @xmath150\\ ] ]    where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the monochromatic luminosity at @xmath153 and 2  kev respectively .",

    "the optical - to - x - ray spectral index of the source is @xmath162 , shown as an asterisk in figure  [ alpha_ox ] and is consistent with @xmath149 values for radio - loud agn ( 3c  390.3 , 3c  120 and 3c  273 ) taken from @xcite .    to further investigate whether the excess uv flux is caused by possible presence of a nuclear star - burst in the host galaxy",
    ", we constructed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of rxj1633.3 + 4719 using data from _ 2mass _ , _ wise _ , _ iras _ 60 and 100@xmath163 and compared it with the sed of m82 , which is one of the best studied star - burst galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath164  ghz luminosity of m82 ( @xmath165 ) is @xmath166 , which is two order of magnitude smaller than that of rxj1633.3 + 4719 .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the sed of rxj1633.3 + 4719 and m82 .",
    "the seds were normalized at 5@xmath167  hz ( @xmath168 ) where the star - burst contribution peaks .",
    "the flux from the agn dominates over the m82 flux above 7@xmath169  hz i.e. @xmath170  ev . thus we can conclude that the uv flux of rxj1633.3 + 4719 is not affected by a putative nuclear star - burst .",
    "the best diagnostic to distinguish between star - forming galaxies and radio - loud agn is the fir - radio correlation parameter @xmath171 defined by    @xmath172\\ ] ]    where @xmath173 is the 1.4  ghz flux density in units of @xmath174 and @xmath175 is the far - infrared flux density in units of @xmath176 defined by    @xmath177    the star - burst galaxies have @xmath178 .",
    "the estimated @xmath171 parameter for rxj1633.3 + 4719 is 1.2 which is much lower than the cut - off of @xmath179 .    in order to examine whether the strong uv",
    "excess emission is due to the host galaxy contamination in the om bandpass , we have taken one normal spiral galaxy ( sb ) template from @xcite and compared its sed with our source rxj1633.3 + 4719 .",
    "the host template was normalized to the source flux at @xmath180 .",
    "we found that the template sed rises steeply with wavelength while the sed of rxj1633.3 + 4719 is flat ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the sed of rxj1633.3 + 4719 and sb template are shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "we have also shown that the maximum percentage for the degree of host galaxy contamination in uv is @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the excess uv emission can not be attributed to the host contamination .",
    "the only possibility left then is the high energy tail of synchrotron emission from a jet , which can be described by a power - law as observed .",
    "the slope of the uv spectrum ( @xmath182 ) is consistent with the slope for flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and originates from the high energy end of the synchrotron component .",
    "further investigations using @xmath183-ray data from fermi - large area telescope would be useful ( see e.g. @xcite ) to fully test the jet scenario in rxj1633.3 + 4719 .",
    "the broadband uv to hard x - ray spectral fitting for rxj1633.3 + 4719 reveals the presence of jet emission in the uv , disc emission as ultra - soft x - ray excess below 0.5  kev , partial covering ionized absorption below 1  kev and variable primary emission in the hard x - ray band above 2  kev .",
    "we did not find any reflection signature including the fe line or strong soft x - ray excess in the energy spectra .",
    "the spectral modelling using _ suzaku _ xis data in the @xmath184  kev band agrees well with the modelling of _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn data .",
    "although the disc extends down to the innermost regions as implied by the ultra - soft excess emission , the absence of blurred reflection suggests lack of strong illumination of the disc by the hot corona . this could be possible",
    "if the corona acts as the base of the jet @xcite and the coronal emission is beamed away from the disc .    from the modelling of the broadband spectrum , we estimated the relative contribution of different components to the observed flux in uv and x - ray bands .",
    "the uv luminosity integrated from @xmath185 to @xmath186 , covering three uv filters u , uvw1 , uvm2 , is @xmath187  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "the jet luminosity @xmath188  erg  s@xmath7 is @xmath189 of @xmath190 , considering negligible host galaxy starlight contribution below @xmath186 @xcite . the x - ray ( 0.3@xmath010  kev ) luminosity is @xmath191  erg  s@xmath7 where the jet component contributes only @xmath192 with @xmath193  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "thus the jet contribution to the x - ray band is negligible compared to the disc / corona emission .",
    "the x - ray emission from rxj1633.3 + 4719 is variable with fractional variability amplitude @xmath4=13.5@xmath5 and the variability is energy dependent ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] and fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude is nearly constant at energies below 1  kev and increases with energy above 1  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the soft band ( 0.3@xmath01  kev ) offset in the flux - flux plot and constant @xmath4 below 1  kev indicate the presence of a soft constant component similar to that observed in iras  13224 - 3809 @xcite .",
    "the source hardness increases with increasing 0.3@xmath010  kev x - ray flux which is in contrast with radio - quiet agn @xcite . the hardening of the source with increasing 0.3@xmath010  kev x - ray flux rules out absorption - induced variability and allows us to conclude that the x - ray spectral variability in rxj1633.3 + 4719 is predominantly due to the primary continuum which may vary both in normalization and spectral shape .",
    "the modelling of the x - ray variability spectrum as a constant disc component and variable primary emission explains the observed fractional rms(e ) quite well .",
    "we find that the normalization and photon index of the primary continuum are anti - correlated with each other by @xmath194 with 1@xmath195 significance .",
    "such x - ray spectral variability can not be due to variations in the comptonization seed photons alone , because that would lead to spectral steepening with flux .",
    "the dominant x - ray variability of rxj1633.3 + 4719 must be intrinsic to the hot corona which may be related to the dynamic base of the jet .",
    "simultaneous multiwavelength observations with _",
