    "the experimental data on these decays have been accumulated to wait for reliable theoretical calculations . with the discovery of the orbitally excited charmed baryons @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite , it would be of great interest for one to investigate the @xmath10 semileptonic decays into these baryons .    from the phenomenological point of view , these semileptonic transitions are interesting since in principle they may account for a sizeable fraction of the inclusive semileptonic rate of @xmath10 decay .",
    "in addition , the properties of excited baryons have attracted attention in recent years .",
    "investigation on them will extend our ability in the application of qcd .",
    "it can also help us foresee any other excited heavy baryons that have not been discovered yet .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry @xcite is a useful tool to classify the hadronic spectroscopy containing a heavy quark @xmath13 . in the infinite mass limit , the spin and parity of the heavy quark and that of the light degrees of freedom are separately conserved .",
    "coupling the spin of light degrees of freedom @xmath14 with the spin of heavy quark @xmath15 yields a doublet with total spin @xmath16 ( or a singlet if @xmath17 ) .",

    "the lowest states of such excited charmed states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , have been observed to be identified with @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively @xcite .    however , the difficulties in the sm calculations are mainly due to the poor understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of the strong interaction ( qcd ) .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) based on the heavy quark symmetry provides a model - independent method for analyzing heavy hadrons containing a single heavy quark @xcite .",
