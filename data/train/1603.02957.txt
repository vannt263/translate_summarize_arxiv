    "the concept of monogamy @xcite is an intrinsic aspect in the study of quantum correlations in multiparty systems and plays a precursory role in quantum security @xcite and multiport communication protocols such as super dense - coding @xcite . in its most primitive avatar ,",
    "monogamy of quantum correlation states : _ if two parties _ a _ and _ b _ in a multiparty quantum state ( say , @xmath1 ) are maximally quantum correlated ( @xmath2 ) , then neither _ a _ nor _ b _ can possess any quantum correlation with a third party , i.e. , @xmath3 . _",
    "the above statement is satisfied by all quantum correlation measures , and is a clear departure from classical correlations which are not bound to such constraints .",
    "interestingly , monogamy property is not limited to quantum correlations but is manifested in other quantum properties such as bell inequality violations @xcite , quantum steering @xcite , channel capacities @xcite , and contextual inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , in general , two parties in a quantum state need not necessarily share maximal quantum correlation , and are thus able to share some correlations with other parties , albeit in a constrained way .",
    "the concept of monogamy thus restricts the distribution of bipartite quantum correlations in multiparty quantum systems but its quantification is not always achievable . for three - qubit systems , an important figure of merit , the _ monogamy inequality _",
    ", was obtained for an entanglement measure called the tangle @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for a general three - qubit state , @xmath1 , the amount of tangle ( @xmath4 ) shared between the party @xmath5 , individually with parties @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is bounded above by the tangle shared by @xmath5 with @xmath8 taken as a whole .",
    "mathematically , this implies : @xmath9 + @xmath10 .",
    "it is easy to verify , that the inequality satisfies the aforementioned statement for monogamy .",
    "if @xmath11 = 1 , then @xmath10 is necessarily zero , as @xmath12 1 .",
    "moreover , the monogamy inequality for tangle was shown to exist even in @xmath0-qubit quantum states @xcite . in literature ,",
    "states and quantum correlations that satisfy the above monogamy inequality are termed as _",
    "monogamous_. however , it is well known that the monogamy inequality is not satisfied universally for all quantum correlation measures , even for three - qubit states @xcite .",
    "entanglement measures such as entanglement of formation @xcite , apart from information - theoretic measures such as quantum discord @xcite and known to be , in general , non - monogamous .",
    "recent results on monogamy have shown that quantum correlation measures may satisfy the monogamy inequality by minute extensions of the upper bound @xcite , increasing fractional and integer exponents of quantum correlation measures @xcite , or by considering large number of parties @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for all quantum correlation measures , one can define a _ monogamy score _",
    "@xcite , which captures the difference between the non - negative quantities , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , in a quantum state , @xmath15 .",
    "the monogamy score ( @xmath16 ) is postive for all measures that satisfy the monogamy inequality , and is bounded above by the term @xmath13 . in recent works , for @xmath0-qubit pure quantum states , the upper bound for all quantum measures , regardless of the fact that they satisfy the inequality , has been expressed as functions of the genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath16 is trivially zero for situations where the inequality is satisfied ( as @xmath17 0 ) .",
    "however , for quantum correlation measures that do not satisfy the monogamy inequality , there does not exist a non - trivial lower bound .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether there exists a bound on the value by which the monogamy inequality can be violated .",
    "the existence of a non - trivial lower bound on @xmath16 is an important aspect in the study of various quantum information protocols .",
    "monogamy poses a fundamental restriction on the sharability and distribution of quantum resources , and while this provides a significant advantage in obtaining bounds on secret key rates in quantum cryptography @xcite , it also restricts the availability of resources in multipartite protocols such as dense coding @xcite .",
    "moreover , the monogamy score has been used as an important figure of merit in studies on multiparty quantum states @xcite , identification of quantum channels @xcite , and distinguishing phases of many - body systems @xcite . however , the monogamy score is a difficult quantity to compute and estimate for generic quantum states and generic quantum correlations .",
    "it is therefore interesting to derive both upper and lower bounds of the monogamy score .",
    "while the upper bounds of monogamy score are known in the literature @xcite , our study aims at obtaining a non - trivial lower bound of the quantity .    in this work ,",
    "we determine a non - trivial lower bound on the negative monogamy score of quantum correlation measures that violate the monogamy inequality , using an information - theoretic complementarity between the normalized purity of the reduced state ( @xmath18 ) and quantum correlation shared between two parties ( @xmath19 ) . we observe that , under certain conditions , for three - qubit quantum states the lower bound reduces to the negative of the von neumann entropy @xcite of the single - qubit reduced density matrix . using a set of well - known quantum states ,",
    "we analytically derive the lower bound for larger number of parties and examine its variation and tightness .",
    "moreover , we numerically evaluate the bound for a set of entanglement and information - theoretic quantum correlation measures by randomly generating haar - uniform three - qubit states , to show that the bound is satisfied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we briefly review the monogamy of quantum correlation measures , and the complementarity relation between the normalized purity of a subsystem with respect to the bipartite quantum correlation @xmath20 in the quantum system .",

    "we begin with a brief discussion on the monogamy inequality , as introduced by coffman _ et al .",

    "consider that @xmath20 is a bipartite quantum correlation measure .",
    "for a multipartite quantum system described by state @xmath21 , the monogamy property is captured by the inequality @xmath22 where the party @xmath5 is the nodal observer .",
    "quantum correlation measures that universally satisfy the above inequality is said to satisfy monogamy or is monogamous .",
    "similarly , the quantum state , @xmath23 , is said to be monogamous under the quantum correlation measure @xmath20 , if it satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : std - mono - ineq ] ) .",
    "we note that the state need not be monogamous for all quantum correlations measures , and in general , can be non - monogamous",
    ". an important figure of merit to investigate the monogamy inequality is the monogamy score @xcite .",
    "it encapsulates the deficit between the quantities in the monogamy inequality , and is defined as @xmath24 an obvious extension of the monogamy inequality is that the @xmath25 is non - negative ( @xmath26 ) for all monogamous @xmath27 .",
    "one can interpret a positive @xmath25 as `` residual '' quantum correlation of an @xmath0-party quantum state that is not captured by the distributed bipartite quantum correlations , which in essence captures some form of multipartite correlations in the system @xcite .",
    "several quantum correlation measures , including entanglement monotones such as tangle @xcite , squashed entanglement @xcite and squared negativity @xcite , are monogamous , as opposed to measures such as entanglement of formation @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , negativity @xcite , logarithmic negativity @xcite , and quantum work - deficit @xcite .",
    "we now discuss an information - theoretic complementarity relation , for multipaty quantum states , between the normalized purity of a subsystem of the state and the bipartite quantum correlation the subsystem shares with rest of the system , as derived in ref .",
    "let us consider a bipartite quantum correlation measure @xmath20 , for quantum state @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two subsystems of the state .",
    "let us say , @xmath20 satisfies the conditions ( i ) @xmath31 , which is true for a host of quantum correlation measures @xcite , and ( ii ) @xmath32 . for such measures , it has been shown that @xmath20 obeys a non - trivial complementarity relation between purity of the reduced state , @xmath33 , and the shared bipartite quantum correlation in the state , @xmath34 , as given below @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined as , @xmath37 and quantifies the normalized purity of the system @xcite in the @xmath29-part , and @xmath38 , given by @xmath39 represents the normalized quantum correlation of the system in the @xmath29:@xmath30 bipartition .",
    "for example , an important quantity that satisfies the complementarity relation is the quantum mutual information between two parties , defined as , @xmath40 = @xmath41 + @xmath42 - @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 , which captures the total correlations in a system , @xmath34 , satisfies the condition @xmath44 .",
    "hence if one considers the correlation , @xmath45 = @xmath46 , the complementarity is naturally satisfied .",
    "moreover , for tripartite quantum states , @xmath47 , the complementarity relation reduces to @xmath48 and is independent of the dimension of the system , and can be shown to be saturated by the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite .",
    "this complementarity relation has potential application in quantum information protocol .",
    "in particular , it has been used to obtain a security proof of quantum cryptography for individual attacks via a variation @xcite of the ekert key distribution @xcite protocol .",
    "we note that the complementarity relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cr ] ) , is satisfied by a host of quantum correlation measures , irrespective of the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , as shown in appendix [ app ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an important aspect of the monogamy score , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mono - score ] ) , is that the quantity has a distinct upper bound given by the term @xmath49 , where we use @xmath19 = @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that for monogamous @xmath20 , the amount of distributed bipartite entanglement in a multipartite state is bounded by the amount of block entanglement shared by a single party with the rest of the system .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the upper bound of @xmath25 , for a large number of pure @xmath0-qubit states , is determined by a set of entropic or quadratic functions of the genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite of the state @xmath19 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "for monogamous @xmath20 , there exists a definite lower bound on @xmath25 , given by @xmath51 0 .",
    "however , for @xmath20 that does not satisfy monogamy inequality , in general , the situation is not straightforward .",
    "though the upper bound remains the same , a non - trivial lower bound is not obvious . for cases where @xmath19 is not monogamous with respect to @xmath20 , @xmath25 can be negative .",
    "one of the primary motivation of our work is to find out the non - trivial degree or limit to which this violation of monogamy inequality occurs . in other words , we question , _ what is the worst negative value of the quantity @xmath25 ? _    in this section , we aim at obtaining the lower bound on monogamy scores , for non - monogamous measures @xmath20 , by making use of the complementarity relation , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cr ] ) . in deriving the lower bounds on @xmath25 below",

    "<S> in multiparty quantum systems , the monogamy inequality proposes an upper bound on the distribution of bipartite quantum correlation between a single party and each of the remaining parties in the system , in terms of the amount of quantum correlation shared by that party with the rest of the system taken as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well - known that not all quantum correlation measures universally satisfy the monogamy inequality . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we aim at determining the non - trivial value by which the monogamy inequality can be violated by a quantum correlation measure . using an information - theoretic complementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum correlation in any given multiparty state , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a non - trivial lower bound on the negative monogamy score for the quantum correlation measure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the three - qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von neumann entropy of the single qubit reduced density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically examine the tightness of the derived lower bound for certain @xmath0-qubit quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> further , we report numerical results of the same for monogamy violating correlation measures using haar uniformly generated three - qubit states . </S>"
