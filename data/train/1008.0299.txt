    "claims of room temperature ferromagnetism ( fm ) have been made for several semiconducting oxides that do not contain any magnetic ions . the phenomenon has been observed in a variety of binary oxides prepared in nanoparticle@xcite and thin - film form @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable interest in these otherwise non - magnetic oxides as a part of the effort to develop suitable materials for spintronic devices .",
    "this work is concerned with the origin of room temperature magnetic hysteres is observed in single crystal srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) substrates ( sto ) purchased from a variety of suppliers .",
    "the hysteresis , which can not be explained by non - interacting paramagnetic impurities , is interesting in light of recent work which highlights the considerable potential of sto surfaces for electronic and spintronic devices .",
    "consider , for example , the two dimensional electron gas formed at the interfaces of laalo@xmath0/sto heterostructures @xcite as well as other phenomena such as blue luminescence @xcite and high conductivity @xcite produced by ar@xmath5 irradiation .",
    "the observation of fm hysteresis in commercial sto raises several questions , which include whether the hysteresis is a bulk or surface effect , whether or not it can be associated with an impurity phase , or whether or not it can be associated with a particular kind of point or extended defect that can be controlled through materials processing .",
    "it has been established that the surfaces of sto can be quite complex .",
    "for example , slicing a verneuil grown sto crystal into substrates suitable for thin film growth produces a large concentration of dislocations and voids @xcite near the cut surface while annealing in oxidizing or reducing conditions can promote segregation into ti - rich or sr - rich regions in the surface skin layer@xcite . in the experiments described below ,",
    "particular attention is paid to the effect of annealing in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres since it has been found in other oxides where fm has been observed , for example tio@xmath6@xcite and hfo@xmath6@xcite , that the magnitude of the remanent moment can be altered by vacuum annealing .",
    "it is interesting to note that in sto oxygen vacancies donate free electrons to the hybridized ti(3d)-o(2p ) conduction band and can produce superconductivity with maximum t@xmath7 0.3 k @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity is a compelling reason to study the magnetic properties of reduced sto .",
    "finally , sto is a common substrate for metal oxide thin film growth . since certain thin film materials with interesting magnetic and charge ordering properties such as lavo@xmath0 @xcite",
    "can only be produced in reducing atmospheres @xcite , it is important to be aware of how reduction at elevated temperatures affects the magnetic properties of the substrate .",
    "sto ( 100 ) single crystal substrates were purchased from a variety of suppliers : alfa aesar , crystec , mti corporation and semiconductor wafer inc .",
    "substrates were purchased in both one side polished ( 1sp ) and two side polished ( 2sp ) form .",
    "extreme care was taken - for example always using teflon tweezers that had never been in contact with stainless steel - to avoid contamination of the samples with magnetic elements@xcite .",
    "magnetic moment measurements were performed using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "some small degree of magnetic hysteresis at 300 k was measured in every single one of the over 50 substrates tested .    to establish whether the hysteresis was a bulk or a surface effect , two sorts of tests were done .",
    "hcl and hno@xmath0 acids were both found to reduce the size of the remanent moment while polishing the unpolished surfaces in stages down to mirror - like smoothness was found to completely remove all traces of fm hysteresis .",
    "[ polishing](b ) compares measurements of moment versus field on sto substrates with one side polished ( 1sp ) - the as purchased state - with substrates with both @xmath8 mm surfaces polished ( 2sp ) as well as substrates with all six sides of the substrate polished ( asp ) .",
    "each round of polishing removed a surface layer approximately 10 to 15 @xmath9 thick .",
    "the hysteresis is clearly associated with the unpolished surfaces of the substrate .",
    "the saturation magnetization can be extracted by subtracting out the diamagnetic contribution .",
    "[ polishing](a ) summarizes the whole set of measurements of the saturation moment versus unpolished surface area .",
    "energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) and x - ray diffraction spectra ( xrd ) were measured on both the unpolished and polished surfaces of the sto substrates .",
    "these measurements revealed no significant difference between the polished and unpolished surfaces except that the xrd lines were considerably wider for the stressed and disordered unpolished side of the substrates , as expected@xcite .",
    "data for the unpolished surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "[ edx_xrd ] which reveal no impurity phases or magnetic elements to the level of sensitivity of these techniques .",
    "the peak near 3.7 kev indicates the presence of a small amount of calcium in these substrates .",
    "there are at least two possibilities for the fm hysteresis of the unpolished surfaces .",
    "firstly , it could be due to particles of fm material left from either the diamond saw or wire saw cuts used to produce substrates from the crystal boule , or from handling by the suppliers of the unpolished edges using stainless steel tweezers . at low enough concentration , these particles",
    "would not be detected by the edx and xrd measurements illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edx_xrd ] .",
    "secondly , the hysteresis could be associated with extended or point defects such as oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of the cut surface . two different approaches to this question",
    "were taken : ( i ) a systematic study was undertaken of the effect of annealing atmosphere and temperature on both the room temperature magnetic hysteresis as well as the width of the xrd lines .",
    "the reasoning was that annealing should heal some of the disorder simultaneously reducing the width of the xrd lines and remanent moment .",
    "in addition , annealing in vacuum allows one to introduce a controlled density of oxygen vacancies via the annealing temperature .",
    "( ii ) artificial disorder was introduced by ar@xmath5 or ar@xmath10 bombardment of polished sto surfaces to see if a magnetic moment could be induced which would clearly be associated with disorder .",
    "the goal was to find a way of introducing controlled amounts of disorder associated with surface ferromagnetism .",
    "annealing of the sto substrates was performed at different temperatures in either a vacuum of approximately @xmath11 torr ( reducing environment ) or in air ( oxidizing environment ) by placing the substrate in an al@xmath6o@xmath0 crucible inside a quartz evacuation chamber in the furnace .",
    "a pattern emerged which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ treatments ] .",
    "annealing in air , for @xmath12c , destroyed or significantly decreased the room temperature remanent magnetization while annealing in vacuum for @xmath13c did not destroy the remanent magnetization .    the vacuum annealing experiments produced samples with a wide range of oxygen vacancy density .",
    "increasing the annealing temperature from 800@xmath1c to 1100@xmath1c systematically decreased the dc resistivity ( measured using the van der pauw technique ) and increased the dark colouration of the sto substrates .",
    "it is possible to produce darker , even less resistive samples by either annealing the substrate along with powdered ti in a sealed , evacuated tube or by intentionally growing grossly oxygen deficient crystals @xcite .",
    "sample magnetization data for one of the reduced substrates as well as that of a srtio@xmath14 crystal are shown in fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction ] ( a ) .",
    "note that data of fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction ] ( a ) are for samples that have no unpolished surfaces .",
    "the m vs. h relations of all the oxygen deficient samples were linear , while only two such curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction ] ( a ) for simplicity .",
    "this demonstrates clearly that oxgyen vacancies do not produce fm in sto .",
    "the vacancy densities were not directly measured but there is a well known correlation between the room temperature dc resisitivity and free carrier concentration@xcite where , in the simplest picture , each oxygen vacancy donates two free electrons to the conduction band . in fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction](b ) , the susceptibility of pure sto , which is due to the diamagnetic response of the closed shell ions plus a van vleck term@xcite , is @xmath15 emu / g - g and becomes less negative with the positive pauli contribution of an increasing number of free carriers .",
    "this was the explanation given by frederikse and candela@xcite and the data illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction](b ) agrees to within 10% with their earlier measurements@xcite .",
    "almost all of the samples included in fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction](b ) have carrier concentrations compatible with low temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "because the samples which have carrier density ( @xmath16@xmath4 ) compatible with superconductivity exhibit linear magnetic susceptibilities , it appears that sto is not a system where fm and superconductivity coexist .",
    "having concluded that oxgyen vacancies do not produce the fm hysteresis , one might hypothesize that other kinds of disorder such as dislocations and interstitials produced by the diamond saw cuts may be associated with the fm hysteresis .",
    "x - ray diffraction reveals that annealing does indeed relieve the strain on the unpolished surfaces as shown in fig .",
    "[ linewidth](a ) which illustrates how the linewidth of the ( 003 ) diffraction peak from the unpolished side decreases with annealing temperature .",
    "the line on the polished side is also illustrated , for comparison .",
    "the decrease in linewidth with annealing temperature is seen in all diffraction peaks for both vacuum and air annealing . however , fig .",
    "[ linewidth](b ) which is a plot of of the remanent moment versus linewidth of the x - ray diffraction peaks , suggests that the correlation between remanent moment and surface strain and disorder is not strong not only because of the scatter in the data but because air annealing and vacuum annealing have such different effects on magnetization but produce similar decreases in the linewidth of the x - ray diffraction peaks    as mentioned earlier , ar ion bombardment was utilized to produce surface disorder in an attempt to mimic the disorder observed in the x - ray spectra of the unpolished surfaces .",
    "this was done by taking samples with polished surfaces exhibiting linear magnetization versus applied field relations and mounting them with non - ferromagnetic adhesive onto 5-cm diameter si wafers and placing them in an ar ion beam to receive a dose of 10@xmath17 ions .",
    "two beam energies were attempted : either 10 kev ( range 92  straggle 42  estimated using srim software ( stopping range of ions in matter@xcite ) ) or 90 kev ( range 570  straggle 250 ) .",
    "a dose of 10@xmath17 90 kev ions produces a huge amount of damage , milling away part of the surface and producing an amorphous layer than can be observed using x - ray diffraction .",
    "[ argon](b ) contrasts the ( 002 ) diffraction peaks from both irradiated and non - irradiated surfaces of the same substrate .",
    "note the creation of a broad peak at lower diffraction angle which is associated with the amorphous layer of thickness roughly 60 nm . for comparison ,",
    "diffraction peaks in amorphous si can have widths well over one degree @xcite .",
    "note that the main ( 002 ) peak of the ar bombarded side of the crystal is narrower than that of the non - irradiated side . on the non - irradiated but polished surface ,",
    "x - rays are scattered from both a surface strained layer plus a less strained region deeper in the crystal . on the irradiated side , the narrow peak represents diffraction from deeper in the crystal than the surface amorphous layer .",
    "more importantly , a lack of magnetic hysteresis was measured after ion bombardment as shown in fig .",
    "[ argon ] ( a ) for both incident ar ion kinetic energies .",
    "it has been conclusively shown that fm is not associated with oxgyen vacancies , nor with an amorphous layer produced by ar ion bombardment while fig .",
    "[ linewidth](b ) offers only a weak correlation between surface strain and disorder and the observed saturation moment .",
    "it is difficult to prove the second hypothesis , in which the fm hysteresis of the unpolished surfaces is due to contamination by fm particles , because of the low particle density . recall that neither xrd nor edx spectra illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edx_xrd ] showed any evidence of impurity elements or phases .",
    "the approach taken here was to see whether artificially contaminated samples produced the same annealing behaviour as the raw substrates .",
    "for the final set of experiments performed samples were prepared with no moment by soaking a 1sp substrate in nitric acid for 10 minutes in an ultrasonic bath as shown in fig .",
    "[ spiked](a ) .",
    "subsequently such samples were artificially contaminated with iron by rubbing the unpolished surface on stainless steel .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ spiked](a),(b ) and ( c ) demonstrates that artificial contamination creates a moment of roughly the same magnitude as observed in the as purchased 1sp substrates .",
    "finally the iron contaminated samples were subject to the same annealing treatments as untreated 1sp substrates .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "[ treatments ] and fig .",
    "[ spiked](b ) and ( c ) illustrates that the iron contaminated samples demonstrate the same annealing behaviour as the untreated 1sp substrates .    a natural explanation of fig . [ treatments ] and fig",
    "[ spiked ] comes from a comparison of the magnetic properties of iron and the iron oxides which are listed in table [ iron_oxides ] .",
    "iron particles on the rough surfaces of the substrates coming from either diamond saw cuts or handling with stainless steel tweezers , are the source of the fm hysteresis observed on the unpolished surfaces .",
    "below 900@xmath1c , vacuum annealing would either maintain these particles in the fe state , or at 1100@xmath1c there may oxidation to antiferromagnetic wustite feo whose presence is indicative of a highly reducing environment @xcite . on",
    "the other hand air annealing would oxidize the iron particles to antiferromagnetic @xmath18fe@xmath6o@xmath0 at all temperatures .",
    "@xmath18fe@xmath6o@xmath0 is more thermodynamically stable than @xmath19fe@xmath6o@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "definite confirmation of the presence of iron on unpolished surfaces awaits detection by more sensitive surface elemental probes like pixe ( particle induced x - ray emission ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare the present work with the only other systematic study of the ferromagnetic properties of commercial substrates by salzer _",
    "et al . _ who considered sapphire ( al@xmath6o@xmath0 ) substrates purchased from crystec@xcite .",
    "the authors studied the magnetic hysteresis curves of both 1sp and 2sp samples of a variety of orientations and sizes .",
    "significantly they also tried to measure surface magnetic impurity concentration using pixe ( proton irradiated x - ray emission ) measurements .",
    "the pixe measurements revealed that fe was the main impurity and that the average fe concentration on unpolished c - faces was 230 ng/@xmath20 while on polished c - faces the concentration was 10 ng/@xmath20 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that a linear fit of fig .",
    "[ polishing](a ) yields fe density of 190@xmath21 ng/@xmath20 if one assumes that the moment of the substrates is produced by pure fe with a room temperature magnetization of 220 emu / g .",
    "there has been an on - going discussion surrounding ferromagnetism in magnetic ion free oxides .",
    "on one side are those who argue that ferromagnetism is produced by defects in the thin flims@xcite , while on the other side are those who argue that it is a spurious effect produced by iron contamination@xcite . since some of the strongest claims linking oxygen vacancies and ferromagnetism have been made for tio@xmath22 thin films , it is useful to compare the tio@xmath22 data with the present measurements on single crystal srtio@xmath0 .",
    "a summary of the properties of tio@xmath22 thin films grown by a number of techniques on a variety of substrates appears in table [ tio2_films ] .",
    "the most notable feature of the data is that several groups have found that the saturation magnetization depends on the oxygen partial pressure during film deposition and have also observed that air annealing destroys the ferromagnetism .",
    "all these authors have concluded that this is evidence that oxygen vacancies are producing the ferromagnetic hysteresis of the films and one has cited theoretical support@xcite for oxygen - vacancy - induced - ferromagnetism in tio@xmath6 .",
    "however , no measurements of oxygen vacancy were actually made in these works .",
    "on the other hand , in the present work , reasonable estimates of oxygen vacancy density can be inferred from the free carrier density measurements made and fig .",
    "[ vary_reduction ] shows that sample magnetization is a linear function of applied field even in samples with a large density of bulk oxygen vacancies .",
    "it seems very clear that oxygen vacancies do not produce ferromagnetism in sto .",
    "the effect of vacuum annealing on sto and tio@xmath6 is quite similar where oxygen vacancies produce an increase in the electrical conductivity .",
    "hence , the differences in ferromagnetism associated with oxygen vacancies in these two materials must be associated with differences in the ti - o network where sto contains a network of corner shared tio@xmath23 octahedra , while there is a combination of edge and corner sharing in rutile .",
    "this is not the first work to have shown that commercial substrates without films themselves exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis .",
    "saturation moments for various substrates as measured by a number of groups are listed in table [ commercial_substrates ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that aside from the anomalously large moment measured for laalo@xmath0 by hong _",
    "et al._@xcite , there appears to be a rough correlation between substrate moment and the hardness of the substrate which are all harder than stainless steel .",
    "it is difficult to compare the moments of the tio@xmath22 films with the substrates because usually it is the magnetization of the samples , rather than the raw moments that are listed in the papers .",
    "however , it is curious that both yoon _ et al._@xcite and sudakar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find that the magnetization to be a decreasing function of film thickness .",
    "this data could be partially explained by iron contamination on the unpolished substrate surfaces .",
    "it is also puzzling that sudakar _",
    "_ measure magnetization of films produced by reactive rf sputtering to be ten times less than films produced by pulsed laser deposition .",
    "they suggest that it is because the polycrystalline sputtered films on fused quartz may have less defects than the epitaxial pld films on laalo@xmath0 , but this does not seem convincing . a simpler explanation could be that different substrates have different amounts of surface contamination .",
    "it is also interesting that yoon _",
    "_ , found the curie temperature of tio@xmath22 thin film samples to be 880 k which is close to the transition temperature of @xmath19fe@xmath6o@xmath0 as shown in table [ iron_oxides ] .",
    "the present annealing experiments illustrated in fig . [ treatments ] , which can be explained by the presence of iron on the unpolished surfaces of substrates , raise the possibility that the supposed dependence of saturation moment on oxygen partial pressure in the tio@xmath6 films might be the response of the substrates themselves .",
    "ferromagnetic hysteresis with a saturation moment of the order of @xmath24 emu/@xmath20 is regularly observed in sto ( 001 ) substrates with 1 or 2 sides polished as purchased from a variety of suppliers .",
    "oxygen vacancies do not appear to be associated with ferromagnetism in sto nor can a magnetic moment be created by ar ion bombardment .",
    "reduced sto is not a system where fm and superconductivity coexist . in the as purchased samples ,",
    "the hysteresis is associated with the unpolished surfaces and is likely due to fe contamination from handling with stainless steel tweezers or the diamond or wire saw cuts rather than oxygen vacancies or other lattice defects .",
    "it is possible that all single crystal substrates used for thin film growth contain ferromagnetic iron or iron oxide on the unpolished surfaces .",
    "polishing and simple acid washes can remove the weak ferromagnetic signal .",

    "one possible application of the results of this paper is for thin film growers using sto substrates . by annealing at high temperature before film growth , all traces of the ferromagnetic signal of the substrate",
    "can be removed giving film growers confidence that any subsequent ferromagnetic signals are due to the films themselves .",
