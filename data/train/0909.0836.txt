    "magnetic reconnection is thought to be a process , being responsible for many eruptive plasma phenomena in space plasmas and astrophysical plasmas , like geomagnetical substorms or eruptive flares .",
    "although magnetic reconnection in two dimensions ( 2d ) is fairly well understood , e.g. , see the comments in , it would be interesting to have more detailed informations about the topological and geometrical structure of flow and field lines in the vicinity of the singular points of plasma flow and magnetic field .",
    "classical reconnection scenarios , see or sweet - parker model ( see , e.g. , ) propose a magnetic null point and a stagnation point flow into the diffusion region , i.e. the stagnation point is inside this diffusion region .    where the first to analyse the case of incompressible 2d mhd with constant resistivity .",
    "it turned out that either the magnetic field must be of higher order in the spatial variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 or that there is no stagnation point flow , but a shear flow .",
    "therefore their result is , that the classical hyperbolic   stagnation point flow needs higher order terms , concerning the spatial variables ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "solutions locally containing only higher order terms do not allow for topologically / structurally stable magnetic fields .",
    "therefore either no reconnection can take place , as in the case of higher order terms no hyperbolic  magnetic field can exist , or the stagnation point flow is not of hyperbolic type .",
    "annihilation solutions have been studied , where chose a special ansatz for the solution of the resistive mhd to get reconnection solutions .",
    "they emphasize the first order momentum equation and neglect the energy transport ( equation ) or rather the entropy conservation ( equation ) , starting with a nonlinear perturbation of magnetic annihilation solutions .",
    "this lead them to so called reconnective annihilation  solutions , where only one of the two separatrix - lines are crossed , and the other is only tangent to the converging streamlines .",
    "the current sheet has a one - dimensional structure ( straight line ) .",
    "the results found by @xcite , and confirm the results found earlier by , who found more shear - like   flows instead of typical stagnation point flows .    later on and extended the method to curvelinear current sheets .",
    "it was shown by and later on in extended form by that under certain circumstances ( like constant resistivity or current depending / anomalous resistivity and sub - alfvnic flow etc . )",
    "reconnection is impossible , the so called anti - reconnection theorems .    in 3d for constant resistivity",
    "a careful analysis of topologically different solutions has been discussed in . in 2d",
    "such an analysis is missing and should be done here , but without taking the restriction to constant resistivity into account .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned models we do not search for special solutions , but the most _ general _ solution without constant or special non - constant resistivity or a specific non - idealness . thus our analysis covers all forms of non - ideal terms . in the sense of topological fluid dynamics",
    "we want to get insight how the field and streamlines are rooted in the null point(s ) of flow and field , i.e. which geometrical shapes of field and streamlines are possible and which not .",
    "we define and investigate the influence of an effective  non - constant resistivity and use hereby the full energy equation of resistive mhd instead of using only the assumption of incompressibility .",
    "the problems concerning ( exact ) analytical models very often are :    * the physical quantity resistivity  is often only a constant smallness parameters * if really gradients of the resistivity @xmath2 and maybe also the amplitude / absolute value are recognized as important for the non - ideal process , what are the shapes  of such resistivities enabling magnetic reconnection ? * it is not clear which _ flow _ topologies are allowed to generate reconnection , reconnective annihilation solutions , or other solutions for general non - ideal or resistive terms    thus our aims are :    * to show not every non - ideal or resistive process in the vicinity of a null point is a magnetic reconnection process * it is not enough to have a localized resistivity to get a reconnective solution , finding parameters that mark the boundary between reconnection and non - reconnection solutions * why should there be no reconnection process close to the magnetic null point and what happens if we do not restrict ourselves to complete incompressible dynamics without energy transport ? * finding analytical _ and _ exact solutions close to the null point * detailed investigation of topological skeleton of flow and magnetic field in the frame of resistive mhd ; it is an analysis of the resistive system close to singular points of flow and magnetic field * performing linearization , necessary to get information about the skeleton of magnetic reconnection    we will concentrate on the topology and geometrical properties of flow and field and discuss different cases with respect to their implications for magnetic reconnection .    to summarize : the main goal is to get the topological and geometrical skeleton of the resistive mhd equations , i.e. , if the jacobian of the magnetic field at the magnetic null point has only real eigenvalues ( hyperbolic null point ) , which eigenvalues can be found for the jacobian of the plasma velocity at the stagnation point ? in our analysis the null point of the velocity field ( = stagnation point ) , should have an almost identical position and a vanishingly small offset to the magnetic null point .",
    "the resistvity @xmath2 should be a positive quadratic form in @xmath0 and @xmath1 close to the magnetic null point , indicating that the resistivity indicates real dissipation in the form of ohmic heating and annihilation of magnetic flux , see also the explanations and calculations in the section [ sws ] .",
    "how does the geometrical structure of the velocity field look like , and which kind of eigenvalues are allowed by the resistive or in general non - ideal mhd equations ?",
    "the topological classification of 2d vector fields in the vicinity of their null points is described in the textbooks ( with connection about phase portraits of dynamical systems , i.e. systems of ordinary differential equations ) e.g. of @xmath3@xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the topological structure of magnetic fields in the vicinity of null points is described , e.g. , by@xmath5 and concerning the construction of ideal mhd flows , e.g. in@xmath5 .    our interest is to ask which topology and geometry of the _ macroscopic _ flow correspond to which magnetic topology and geometry in the frame of mhd .",
    "in contrast to the analyses mentioned in the previous paragraph we here have to investigate the topological and geometrical properties of _ both _ vector fields , i.e. that of the plasma flow and that of the magnetic field . to perform this analysis we solve the resistive mhd system with a linear ansatz for both vector fields , i.e. , we perform a taylor expansion of both vector fields in the vicinity of their null points , neglecting derivatives higher than the first ones .",
    "that implies that we allow the stagnation point (= null point of the velocity field ) of the velocity field @xmath6 to have a small offset concerning the magnetic null point , but neglecting here , the influence of the second derivatives of the velocity field",
    ". an influence would be noticeable for significant offsets , but is negligible for very small offsets , justifying our assumptions .",
    "we will justify this assumptions afterwards at the end of section [ clf ] , estimating the influence of an offset caused by the gravitational force in the case of completely linear velocity and magnetic fields , where the second derivatives of the vector fields vanish automatically .",
    "now let @xmath7 be the offset in @xmath0-direction and @xmath8 the offset in @xmath1-direction .",
    "then we can express the class of linear velocity fields with the help of their first derivatives , i.e. jacobians : @xmath9 in analogy to the magnetic field",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11    according to@xmath5 , every magnetic field of the form of eq.([2b ] ) can be rotated such , that it is represented by a magnetic flux function @xmath12 , so that a standard null point of the magnetic field appears with a constant current density @xmath13 const around the origin , where the magnetic field is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding scenario of a flare loop , with its symmetry axis being almost perpendicular to the photosphere , is given in fig.[bild0 ] .",
    "the current density is @xmath15 such that @xmath16 the different topologies of 2d vector fields are represented by two independent parameters , the threshold current @xmath17 , and the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , the @xmath19 s , or @xmath20 , the current in @xmath21direction @xmath22 implying a bijective relation between the variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the threshold @xmath17 and the actual current @xmath20 , to be precise @xmath25 we will use the four variables @xmath26 if it is convenient , i.e. combinations of the four to simplify the corresponding terms in the equations .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath19 determines the topological structure of the field and the geometrical shape of the field lines . for a divergence free case",
    "there are only three main types of such fields :    * the case that the eigenvalue is zero ( @xmath27 ) corresponds to the one - dimensional current sheet ( degenerated case ) .",
    "* the case that @xmath28 corresponds to field lines being topological circles ( geometrical ellipses ) , if @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , then geometrical circles . all the cases mentioned in the last sentence",
    "are so called o - points .",
    "* the case of the so called x - points , where @xmath31 .",
    "only for the case in the last item a magnetic separatrices exist .",
    "such separating field lines must exist to enable magnetic reconnection .",
    "a necessary condition for magnetic reconnection in 2d is that the plasma flow crosses magnetic separatrices , see , e.g.,@xmath5,@xmath5,@xmath5 , @xmath5 , or@xmath5 .",
    "the current free case is given by @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 and should be excluded , as dissipation in such a case would have nothing to do with the electric current .",
    "the following analysis is restricted to _",
    "pure _ resistive dynamics , i.e. ohmic heating / dissipation without any other loss terms like viscosity or heat conduction .",
    "we choose the coordinate system in such a way , that the gravity is directed in negative @xmath1-direction ( the unit vector in @xmath1-direction is @xmath34 ) .",
    "the basic resistive stationary mhd equations in 2d are given by ( following , e.g. , ) @xmath35 due to stationary maxwell equations the electric field in the 2d case has to be constant , i.e. @xmath36const see , e.g. , .",
    "the same shape of the equations occur , if we introduce a generalized non - ideal term on the right - hand side of ohm s law . as the current density is constant close to the x - point ( see eq.[1b ] )",
    ", the shape of an effective resistivity is that of the non - idealness @xmath37 ( where only the @xmath21-component is non - zero ) , writing @xmath38 the implication is that @xmath39 , as @xmath40 is constant close to the null point .",
    "the non - idealness resulting from two - fluid approach can be written for the one fluid approach , e.g. , following@xmath41 , as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the particle density , @xmath44 the absolute value of the electron charge , @xmath45 the hall term , @xmath46 the anisotropic electron pressure tensor , @xmath47 the electron acceleration term ( in our case averaged over a fitting   characteristic time scale , as our approach is quasi - stationary ) , and the tensor divergence @xmath48 describes the influence of electron inertia .",
    "but even this two - fluid model does not include all terms which may be ( additionally ) responsible for anomalous  resistivity or non - idealness , like , e.g. , electron scattering by wave turbulence generated due to the buneman instability ( often considered , e.g. , and ) , ionization - recombination terms , non - linear electron - ion momentum transfer terms , electron and ion viscosities , radiative losses / gains , and so on .",
    "as we do not specify the non - idealness , having introduced the effective resistivity , our analysis can be used for all physical models with different types of non - ideal terms . for a more specific view but for non - local models of reconnection with a generalized ohm s law , see , e.g.,@xmath5 . the term @xmath49 is therefore only a _",
    "necessary _ trigger  enabling reconnection , not a sufficient one , see , e.g. , @xmath5 .",
    "we will calculate the ( almost ) complete solution space of the resistive ( non - ideal ) mhd close to the null points of flow field and magnetic field .",
    "the aim is to find the general correlation between the jacobians of the plasma velocity and the magnetic field , and the shape of the unspecified non - idealness . at first both vector fields",
    "are treated as completely linear , i.e. unbounded fields in an unbounded domain , see section [ clf ] .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that in a bounded domain the fields at the boundary are maybe not analytic , but the extrapolation of the field may produce reasonable finite and regular solutions .",
    "in section [ coli ] we concentrate on the linearized fields and take only first order terms of the spatial variables into account . a similar method to determine the structure of the non - ideal term and",
    "the flow and the magnetic field has been proposed and done , but for the case @xmath50 and for global  fields , in the frame of a toy model in@xmath5 .    with this linear or linearized fields we can draw conclusions with respect to the other mhd quantities , like pressure , density and resistivity :",
    "the lowest order of the magnetic field is linear , the current density is constant , and therefore the lorentz force @xmath45 is linear in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is the reason that all other terms should be also at ( the ) most of first order in the spatial variables .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the plasma pressure @xmath51 is at highest order quadratic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to allow for a linear  pressure force , i.e. we can express @xmath51 by @xmath52 where @xmath53 to @xmath54 are constant coefficients .    as the velocity close to the stagnation point can be represented as a linear term in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the @xmath55 term is also linear in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , or constant .",
    "the mass continuity equation , eq.([4 ] ) implies therefore that the mass density , @xmath56 , has to be constant in lowest order close to the stagnation point .    of course @xmath56 could be a simple linear function close to the null point but",
    "that would imply that the mass density has to vanish on a surface , or rather straight line in 2d , depending on the gradient of the density .",
    "this null - line _ could _ be somewhere inside the linear  region . in one direction the density",
    "could then become negative .",
    "we assume that the density @xmath56 is constant in the vicinity of the null points of magnetic and flow field to prevent @xmath56 to have a negative or zero value within the domain of interest .",
    "in addition it is a reasonable assumption that close to a stagnation point there is a stagnation region  , i.e. the density has a maximum or minimum close to the stagnation point .    in the case of completely linear fields",
    "it is now evident that the mass continuity equation requires a divergence free velocity field , if we assume all terms to have the same or comparable orders in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one has also to take into consideration that at the magnetic null point @xmath57 equals @xmath58 and if we assume that the resistivity is constant , then @xmath59 everywhere in the vicinity of the neutral point .",
    "the same holds for special cases of non - constant resistivity , e.g. , if @xmath2 is a function of the current density @xmath20 only , one can conclude that in the case of a linear field or in the vicinity of the null point the current density is constant and therefore also the function @xmath60const , as @xmath61const .",
    "the electric field @xmath57 is constant also outside the linear region , but the resistivity and current density are , of course , not constant there .",
    "this implies that the term @xmath62 equals to zero within the linear region and therefore the flow is field - aligned everywhere _ within this region _ in lowest order of the spatial variables . to get not such trivial  solutions , which are non - reconnective in lowest order",
    ", we have to regard the resistive ohm s law as a _ definition equation _ for the spatially dependent resistivity , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , to enable reconnection in the vicinity of the null point , the resistivity can not be a function of the current density only .",
    "we designate and regard this coefficient as an effective  resistivity or short resistivity , even if this coefficient originates from collisional theory . as the current density is constant inside within the region of the linear field approximation , the ( effective ) resistivity",
    "is a substitute expression for a general non - ideal term , determining , but vice versa also determined by , the flow and magnetic field line structure !",
    "this relation between the velocity or flow field @xmath6 , the magnetic field @xmath10 and the resistivity @xmath2 will be analysed in this article .",
    "one can also recognize that eq.([7 ] ) ( together with the incompressibility ) at the stagnation point would require a vanishing resistivity in the absence of additional dissipation terms . written with all coefficients and comparing with all orders of @xmath0 and @xmath1 we get the following system of equations , first from the euler or momentum equation @xmath64 and the equations from the energy equation , first neglecting source or heating terms , only including ohmic heating , @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the equations above are ordered after their physical meaning , the first five equations eqs.([9 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) correspond to the first order momentum equations , while eqs.([14 ] ) - ( [ 19 ] ) represent the terms of the energy equation .",
    "the eqs.([12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) are of zeroth order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) are of first order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the eq.([17 ] ) is of the order @xmath67 and eq.([18 ] ) of second order in @xmath0 , respectively eqs.([19 ] ) is of second order in @xmath1 .",
    "in the first subsection we concentrate on linear fields , i.e. fields that are unbounded in an unbounded domain . in the second subsection",
    "we take only zero and first order terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 into account , i.e. we regard a taylor expansion of maximum order one .      if @xmath68 then from eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) it follows @xmath69 and with two terms of the momentum equation , namely eq.([9 ] ) and eq.([10 ] ) , excluding the current free case @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 and the case with o - points , i.e. @xmath30 , we infer that @xmath70 thus @xmath71 should be valid , leading to @xmath72 . as @xmath72 is not representing a realistic equation of state",
    ", @xmath73 must be zero , _ taking terms of every order into acount_.    this is unaffected by the neglecting other source terms , not mentioned here , as the interesting heat conduction term is of the order zero in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and therefore affecting the eq.([14 ] ) only .",
    "now we use the assumption that @xmath74 .",
    "then we rewrite the mhd equations : @xmath75 with eqs.([6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) it can clearly be recognized that at the stagnation point the resistivity must be zero . as the electric field @xmath57 is constant and @xmath59 at the magnetic null point and the stagnation point ,",
    "we conclude that the electric field is zero ( everywhere ) .",
    "the effect of a vanishing compressibility is in resistive mhd also connected with a vanishing electric field .",
    "in addition , as the @xmath0-offset @xmath7 in the fourth equation ( a zeroth order term of the force ) of the system ( [ 24 ] ) couples an additional pressure gradient in @xmath0-direction to this offset only , this offset can be set to zero without loss of generality .",
    "therefore , from @xmath76 and @xmath77 we infer @xmath78 , see the fourth and fifth equation of the system ( [ 24 ] ) ( part of the energy / entropy equation ) .",
    "if we would further allow @xmath79 in the case of non - vanishing gravity , then there would exist only static solutions either ( as in this case @xmath80 must be zero it implies that @xmath81 ) , or the other possible solution branch would need an adiabatic exponent @xmath72 .    for the non - degenerated case ( @xmath82 ) the general solution for the system ( [ 24 ] )",
    "has two branches : @xmath83 where the discriminant @xmath84 must fulfill @xmath85 to guarantee that @xmath80 is real .",
    "this leads to @xmath86 ^ 2 - 4 b^2 \\gamma^2 j_{z}^2 \\geq 0 \\ , , \\label{28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the discriminant of the quadratic equation eq.([27 ] ) .",
    "the inequality eq.([28 ] ) guarantees a real value of @xmath88 .",
    "that leads together with the convention @xmath89 @xmath90 this implies that either the actual current density @xmath91 , then the field lines are hyperbolas or topological circles , or @xmath92 , then only hyperbolic field lines or ( anti-)parallel are possible .",
    "let us now estimate the influence of the offset in @xmath1-direction on the solution , e.g. , for the situation in the corona .",
    "we can express the offset in @xmath1-direction by using the equation for the offset @xmath8 in eq.([25 ] ) @xmath93 assuming that @xmath94 .",
    "we demand that the configuration should really be an x - point , but not a one - dimensional sheet , therefore we assume that the relation between the two characteristic currents is given by a value not much larger than @xmath95 ( correponds to an opening angle of the smaller separatrix angle of only about 2 degrees ) . with the electron charge @xmath44 , the number density @xmath43 and the drift velocity @xmath96 and @xmath97 , it follows for @xmath8 @xmath98 the value @xmath99 must now be compared with the typical lengthscale and values of a magnetic field close to a null point , i.e. the coronal magnetic field is about @xmath100 ( the index c  stands for coronal ) and the scale on which the magnetic field varies linearly should be larger than a debye length ( for coronal parameters in the range of mm to cm )  m ] , but much smaller than the active region loops ( @xmath101 m ) to get an upper limit for @xmath99 .",
    "we therefore use the approximate current sheet thickness @xmath102 . to estimate the current sheet thickness of a finite current sheet , we assume again that the current density @xmath103 , where @xmath96 is the drift velocity , which should not exceed the thermal velocity ( of the electrons ) , i.e. @xmath104 . let @xmath105jk@xmath106 the boltzmann constant , @xmath107a@xmath108s@xmath109kg@xmath106m@xmath110 the dielectric constant , @xmath111 kg the mass of the proton , @xmath112 kg the mass of the electron , @xmath113m@xmath114 the number density , and @xmath115k ( as the thermal temperature is about @xmath116k , we consider an effective temperature @xmath117 , thus that the corresponding drift velocity @xmath96 is definitely below the critical drift velocity given by temperature @xmath118 to guarantee a stable stationary current , instead of an kinetic instability see , e.g. , ) the approximate temperature ( for the coronal parameters see , e.g. , ) .",
    "we choose a small  current density to get the upper limit of @xmath8 .",
    "the offset is then given by @xmath119 the lower bound of the current sheet thickness is approximately given by @xmath120 the fraction of both values should be @xmath121and is then determined by @xmath122 thus for typical coronal parameters the offset in @xmath1-direction has a value of about mm or even some orders of magnitude less , in contrast to the value of the typical lengthscale of the linear x - point region which is at least of the order of one meter or some tenth of meters or even more .",
    "this is an argument or rough justification to neglect the term of the interaction between the shift and the second derivative of @xmath6 .",
    "even if we assume that the drift velocity @xmath96 is , let us say six orders , smaller than the thermal velocity , the fraction @xmath123 would be of the order of some percent .",
    "therefore , even in this extreme regime of the drift velocity , the stagnation point is located within the current sheet , assuming that the sheet is really two - dimensional ( non - singular ) and its extensions in both coordinate directions are about of the same order .",
    "the complete mentioned discussion is valid exactly only in the case of unbounded fields , but it shows that in general the offset due to gravity can be neglected .",
    "the discriminant @xmath87 in eq.([28 ] ) , being larger than zero is only a _",
    "necessary _ criterion .",
    "that @xmath124 has also to be guaranteed .    to fullfil the relation @xmath125 we define two values , namely @xmath126 to represent the relation eq.([27 ] ) @xmath127 which implies for ci @xmath128 and for cii @xmath129 .",
    "the values @xmath130 are explicit functions of the current densities @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "this gives us restrictions for @xmath131 : for @xmath91 the lower bound for @xmath131 is given by the left relation of eq.([31 ] ) otherwise the lower bound is zero , writing @xmath132 such that the non - admissible region is then given by @xmath133\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 for @xmath136 all values of @xmath131 are allowed .",
    "there are no restrictions for @xmath131 , as for @xmath32 the critical value @xmath137 and for @xmath138 all values of @xmath134 are imaginary .    for cii",
    "it is clear that the criterion is given by @xmath139 for @xmath138 no value of @xmath131 can satisfy the relation eq.([35 ] ) . only for @xmath91 solutions",
    "exist in the region beyond the curve fig.[bild ] and the @xmath20-axis .",
    "thus we can summarize : for @xmath91 the allowed values for @xmath140 are given by the relation @xmath141      in the case of a vanishing @xmath131 or @xmath80 the equations again lead to the statement that either @xmath142 in both cases or that again @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the allowed flows are of higher orders with respect to the spatial variables , like indicated in @xmath143 or need special , maybe unphysical thermodynamical constraints .",
    "also the case of general shear flows leads to @xmath72 .",
    "such solutions will not be discussed here .",
    "the resistivity is given by the @xmath21-component of @xmath144 and results in the quadric @xmath145 neglecting the term with @xmath8 , the above equation shows that the isocontours of the resistivity have four branches . in two quadrants",
    "@xmath2 has a positive sign and the other two quadrants represent an effective negative resistivity .",
    "this example of unbounded fields shows an interesting behaviour because the solutions are exact analytical ones and they exhibit the fact that there is a special relation between the derivatives of @xmath6 and of @xmath10 connected about algebraic varieties which generate the solutions .",
    "we stop these investigations here due to the problem of negative resistivity . to interpret this negative effective resistivity ( or negative non - idealness ) and",
    "search for a reasonable physical interpretation or correponding physical mechanism needs further investigation .",
    "here @xmath68 in general , as the equation which contradicts the thermodynamical constraints , the last two equations of eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , being part of the energy equation , are neglected due to their higher order in @xmath146 .    in this case",
    "we only need to regard equations , being of first order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , namely @xmath147 @xmath148 which contain only terms of first order .",
    "this is a nonlinear system consisting of eight , but , of course , effectively seven equations for nine unknowns .      in this case",
    "the stagnation point is identical with the magnetic null point .",
    "the general solutions is now represented by @xmath149 with free parameters @xmath73 and @xmath131 ( and , of course , the magnetic parameters  the threshold current @xmath17 and the actual current @xmath20 ) . the parameter @xmath80 is not free , as it is determined by the fact that the quadric ( surface ) , representing the resistivity , must be an elliptic paraboloid .",
    "we have to introduce another parameter @xmath150 to express @xmath80 as function of @xmath131 and @xmath150 .",
    "the elliptic paraboloid is the only quadric that allows a positive resistivity with one zero ( the vertex of the paraboloid ) at the magnetic null point .",
    "all other quadrics can be excluded , with the exception of the degenerated case of a cylindrical paraboloid , see , e.g. , or .",
    "the cylindrical paraboloids are limiting cases with @xmath151 as is shown as in the example in fig.[cross4 ] ( here the specific value is @xmath152 ) . the general solution is then parameterized by @xmath153 @xmath154 with the restriction @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "multiplication of eq.([cl16 ] ) with @xmath131 , inserting this expression into the expression for the eigenvalue @xmath156 , and completing the square gives @xmath157 if @xmath158 and @xmath159 as assumed , the magnetic field is of hyperbolic type and it is guaranteed that the stagnation point is also of hyperbolic type , i.e. has two purely real eigenvalues , namely one positive value and a negative counterpart .    although the solutions shown here are no reconnection solutions , as the electric field has to be zero , because only resistive dissipation is included in our investigation , they represent almost reconnection solutions(=reconnection - like solutions ) where the necessary condition for reconnection is fulfilled .",

    "we will briefly discuss the problem that the magnetic separatrix is partially identical with the hydrodynamic separatrix . in this case",
    "the plasma flow can only take place across one part of the separatrix , or both separatrix lines are identical and no reconnection can take place",
    ".    one can clearly recognize that in the case @xmath74 and thus @xmath170 both corresponding asymtotical branches(@xmath171separatrix lines ) have the same slope .",
    "thus the hydrodynamical separatrix and the magnetic separatrix are identical , the plasma can not cross the magnetic separatrix and therefore no reconnection can take place .    writing @xmath172 ( if @xmath173 ) , where @xmath174 is the slope of the hydrodynamic separatrix , and inserting this into @xmath175 with the parametric expression for @xmath80 in eq.([cl16 ] ) , we get the slopes @xmath176 of the two asymptotes / separatrix lines @xmath177 where @xmath178 . for @xmath179",
    "the asymptotes are given by @xmath180 and @xmath181 , and for @xmath142 we get @xmath180 and @xmath182 as separatrices .",
    "let @xmath183 , then @xmath184 there is _ one _ corresponding slope of the flow separatrix with respect to one of the magnetic separatrix lines , if @xmath151 .",
    "therefore we can formulate the following theorem ( in analogy to known anti - reconnection theorems ) , which is now restricted to almost reconnective solutions with vanishingly small electric fields and resistive disspation only , i.e. vanishing non - resistive dissipation mechanisms :    [ [ theorem ] ] theorem + + + + + + +    _ if the flow close to the null point is in good approximation incompressible , the electric field is negligible and other kinds of dissipation mechanisms than the resistive dissipation are also negligible , then the plasma flow can not cross the magnetic separatrices if for the both slopes of the both magnetic separatrix lines @xmath185 with @xmath186 and the following is valid : @xmath187 if only i.a ) or i.b ) or ii.a ) or ii.b ) is valid then only one magnetic separatrix can be crossed and as the other stream lines converge to the second magnetic separatrix line without crossings , one could call this reconnective annihilation , see , e.g. , priest & forbes ( 2000 ) . the necessary condition for a complete non - crossing is @xmath74 for @xmath188 and for only partly crossing flows @xmath151 . _    for almost all values of @xmath150 , here @xmath189 , the flow in fig.[cross4 ] ( left column ) crosses all four separatrix branches ( all two separatrix lines ) , the resistivity is positive ( only zero at the null point , middle panel ) , and their isocontours are ellipses ( bottom panel ) . for the special parameter @xmath152",
    "it can be seen in fig.[cross4 ] ( right column ) that the flow , like for the aforementioned magnetic reconnective annihilation solutions , crosses only the separatrix line with the positive slope , while it converges to the other magnetic separatrix , being almost field aligned ( top panel ) , the resistivity being also postive ( middle panel ) , and the isocontours of the resistivity are straight lines ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we now focus on the effective resistivity and therefore on the nature of ohmic heating / disspation .",
    "the resistivity is given by @xmath190 .",
    "\\label{resi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to ensure that the dissipation is positive we prove that the term @xmath191 is larger than zero ( or zero ) for all @xmath150 and @xmath146 .",
    "let @xmath192 and @xmath193 as required for an x - point .",
    "then @xmath194 this implies that the sign of the resistivity @xmath2 depends on the sign of @xmath195 . as the dissipation should be positive , i.e. @xmath196",
    ", thus @xmath73 and @xmath20 must have the same sign .    for @xmath151",
    "it can be recognized from eq.([resi1 ] ) and from the bottom panel fig.[cross4 ] ( for the case @xmath152 ) that the resistivity contour lines are straight lines given by @xmath197 , and therefore the resistivity has the structure of a one - dimensional sheet .",
    "the case @xmath151 therefore reflects the 1d character of the non - idealness , which can also be found in the papers of .",
    "we analyse the solution space of the mhd system with a generalized non - idealness in ohm s law close to an x - type magnetic null point .",
    "this procedure is done to get non - ideal / resistive but formally non - reconnective solutions that can be regarded as reconnection solutions with a vanishing electric field .",
    "such solutions show the parameters and their relation amongst each others , to get non - ideal non - reconnective , i.e. either almost reconnective annihilation or completely almost reconnective (= reconnection - like ) solutions .",
    "we assume that the flow close to the magnetic null point is governed strictly by the pure non - ideal / resistive system of mhd equations , and that the stagnation point is close to the null point ( or that both singular points in the plane are identical ) .",
    "the focus is on the region close to the magnetic null point to investigate the possible type of topology of the corresponding stagnation point ( flow ) . to use a closure for the equations and to analyse the resistive mhd system we use the corresponding energy equation .",
    "we further assume that the density is constant close to the stagnation point .",
    "this assumption is not a necessary , but a plausible condition concerning the mass distribution in the vicinity of stagnation points .",
    "this leads to a vanishing divergence of the plasma velocity and as a logical consequence to a vanishing resistivity close to the stagnation point .",
    "inserting this into resistive ohm s law implies that the electric field has to vanish at the stagnation point .",
    "we conclude that the electric field has to be zero , and as a consequence of the 2d stationary approach the electric field has to be zero everywhere .",
    "this case of vanishing divergence of the velocity field and thus of a vanishing electric field can be regarded as a physical approximation or limit .",
    "obviously a classical reconnection process requires a non - vanishing divergence of the velocity field to produce a non - zero reconnection rate , determined by the constant electric field @xmath57 , see , e.g. , .",
    "from resistive ohm s law one can clearly recognize that close to the magnetic null point the electric field is identical to the convective  electric field generated by the product from resistivity and current density . as the electric field is zero",
    ", the resistivity inside the finite current sheet must be zero at the magnetic neutral point .",
    "the effect is that the resistivity can not be constant close to the magnetic neutral point .",
    "therefore the resistive ohm s law is an equation determining the topological type of the magnetic field and the velocity field and connecting / relating it to the shape of the resistivity , which is a quadratic function of the spatial coordinates .",
    "we call this spatially varying resistivity _ effective resistivity _ or for short resistivity as usual .",
    "as the current density is constant close to the magnetic null point , the right hand side of ohm s law , eq.([6 ] ) could be regarded as a generalized non - ideal term .",
    "a _ necessary _ condition for reconnection is that the plasma flow can cross magnetic separatrices .",
    "we found that crossing of magnetic separatrices requires also an x - type stagnation point flow if the effective resistivity and thus the dissipation should be positive .",
    "the sufficient criterion for reconnection is the crossing of the separatrix and the non - vanishing electric field .",
    "this reconnection process can take place for / in the incompressible case if there is not only a resistive , but an additional non - resistive dissipation ( term ) that occurs only in the energy equation .",
    "therefore one possibility could be heat conduction .",
    "another possibility is the viscous case with constant viscosity . here",
    ", the laplacian of the velocity field vanishes in the first order momentum equation of the ions ( navier - stokes ) as the velocity field is linear .",
    "these cases have to be investigated in more detail but have been discussed under the assumption of constant resistivity , e.g. , by .",
    "the analyses started by us here will be extended to configurations that have density gradients close to the stagnation point and therefore allow for a non - zero electric field .",
    "the extension to energy equations allowing for a deviation from the classical energy equation of resistive mhd will provide us with a relation between the deviation from pure resistive dissipation and deviation from the classical ( x - type ) stagnation point flow .",
