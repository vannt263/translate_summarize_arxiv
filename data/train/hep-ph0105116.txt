    ".8 cm the sm model has been widely discussed in the literature , and serves as an explicit model for studying all low energy experimental data .",
    "but there is no doubt that the sm is an incomplete theory . among the unsolved problems within",
    "the sm is the cp violation , and the number of generations . in sm",
    "there are three generations , and yet , there is no theoretical argument to explain why there are three and only three generations in sm , and there is neither an experimental evidence for a fourth generation nor does any experiment exclude such extra generations .",
    "therefore , if we believe that the fourth generation fermions really exist in nature , we should give their mass spectrum , and take into account their physical effects in low energy physic .",
    "one of the promising areas in the experimental search for the fourth generation , via its indirect loop effects , is the rare b meson decays . on this basis ,",
    "serious attempts to study the effects of the fourth generation on the rare b meson were made by many authors . for examples , the effects of the fourth generation on the branching ratio of the @xmath6 , and the @xmath7 decays is analyzed in [ 1 ] . in [ 2 ] the fourth generation effects on the rare exclusive @xmath8 decay are studied . in [ 3 ] the contributions of the fourth generation to the @xmath9 decay",
    "is analyzed .",
    "moreover , the introduction of the fourth generation fermions can also affect cp violating parameters @xmath10 in the kaon system [ 4 ] .",
    "it is hoped that a definite answer on possible fourth generation at the upcoming @xmath11 and slac b - factories will be found , where this year the upgraded b - factories at slac , and kek will provide us with the first experimental data . amongst the rare flavor",
    "changing decays , the exclusive decay @xmath12 provokes special interest .",
    "in particular , the sm has been exploited to establish a bound on the branching ratio of the above - mentioned decay of the order @xmath13 , which can be quite measurable for the upcoming @xmath11 and slac b - factories , and they are sensitive to the various extensions to the sm because these decays occur only through loops in the sm .",
    "therefore , in this work we will investigate the decay @xmath14 in the existence of a new up - like quark @xmath2 in a sequential fourth generation model sm , which we shall call ( sm4 ) hereafter for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this model is considered as natural extension of the sm , where the fourth generation model is introduced in the same way the three generations are introduced in the sm , so no new operators appear , and clearly the full operator set is exactly the same as in sm .",
    "hence , the fourth generation will change only the values of the wilson coefficients via virtual exchange of the fourth generations up - like quark @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently , this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the relevant effective hamiltonian for the decay @xmath0 in the existence of a new up - like quark @xmath2 in a sequential fourth generation model ( sm4 ) is presented ; and in section 3 , the dependence of the branching ratio on the fourth generation model parameters for the decay of interest is studied using the results of the light- cone qcd sum rules for estimating form factors ; and finally a brief discussion of the results is given .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath15 decay at quark level is described by @xmath16 transition for whom the effective hamiltonian at @xmath17 scale can be written as : @xmath18 where the full set of the operators @xmath19 , and the corresponding expressions for the wilson coefficients @xmath20 in the sm are given in [ 5 ] . as has been mentioned in the introduction , no new operators appear , and clearly the full operator set is exactly same as in sm , thus the fourth generation changes only the values of the wilson coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 via virtual exchange of the fourth generation up quark @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the above mentioned wilson coefficients can be written in the following form : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where the last terms in these expressions describe the contributions of the @xmath2 quark to the wilson coefficients .",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the two elements of the @xmath29 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in deriving",
    "eqs.(2 - 4 ) we factored out the term @xmath30 in the effective hamiltonian given in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the explicit forms of the @xmath31 can easily be obtained from the corresponding wilson coefficients in sm by simply substituting @xmath32 [ 5,6 ] . neglecting the s quark mass , the above effective hamiltonian leads to the following matrix element for the @xmath16 decay in the sm [ 7 ] : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fermi coupling constant",
    ", @xmath35 is the fine structure constant and @xmath30 are products of cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa matrix elements .",
    "the resulting expression of wilson coefficient @xmath36 , which was derived in the context of the sm including @xmath37 corrections is [ 8,9 ] @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 .    at @xmath45 ,",
    "the qcd correction for @xmath46 term is very small ( around @xmath47 ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the transition @xmath16 is a very clean process , since it is practically free from the scale dependence , and free from any long distance effects .",
    "in addition , the presence of a single operator governing the inclusive @xmath48 transition is an appealing property .",
    "therefore , the theoretical uncertainty within the sm is only related to the value of the wilson coefficient @xmath36 due to the uncertainty in the top quark mass . in this work ,",
    "we have considered possible new physics in @xmath49 only through the value of that of wilson coefficient .    in this spirit",
    ", the transition @xmath16 in eq.(5 ) can only include extra contribution due to the fourth generation fermion , hence , the fourth generation fermion contribution modify only the value of the wilson coefficient @xmath36 ( see eqs.(2 - 4 ) ) , and it does not induce any new operators : @xmath50 where @xmath51 can be obtained from @xmath52 by substituting @xmath53 .    as a result",
    ", we obtain a modified effective hamiltonian , which represents @xmath49 decay in the presence of the fourth generation fermion : @xmath54 \\bar{s}\\gamma_{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_{5})b\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma_{\\mu } ( 1-\\gamma_{5})\\nu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , in spite of such theoretical advantages , it would be a very difficult task to detect the inclusive @xmath48 decay experimentally , because the final state contains two missing neutrinos and many hadrons",
    ". therefore , only the exclusive channels , namely @xmath55 , are well suited to search for and constrain for possible `` new physics '' effects .    in order to compute @xmath56 decay ,",
    "we need the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian eq.(10 ) between the final and initial meson states .",
    "this problem is related to the non - perturbative sector of qcd and can be solved only by using non - perturbative methods .",
    "the matrix element @xmath57 has been investigated in a framework of different approaches , such as chiral perturbation theory [ 10 ] , three point qcd sum rules [ 11 ] , relativistic quark model by the light front formalism [ 12 ] , effective heavy quark theory [ 13 ] , and light cone qcd sum rules [ 14,15 ] . as a result ,",
    "the hadronic matrix element for the @xmath56 can be parameterized in terms of five form factors : @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , is the polarization 4-vector of @xmath60 meson .",
    "the form factor @xmath61 can be written as a linear combination of the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .    after performing summation over @xmath60 meson polarization and taking into account the number of light neutrinos @xmath67 for the differential decay width",
    ", we get in [ 7 ] : @xmath68 \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the usual triangle function with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from eq.(13 ) , we can see that the decay width for @xmath56 contains three form factors : v , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "these form factors were calculated in the framework of qcd sum rules in [ 14,15,16 ] . however , in this work , in estimating the total decay width , we have used the results of [ 16 ] , where these form factors were calculated by including one - loop radiative corrections to the leading twist 2 contribution : @xmath72 and the relevant values of the form factors at @xmath73 are : @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 note that all errors , which come out , are due to the uncertainties of the b - quark mass , the borel parameter variation , wave functions , and radiative corrections are quadrature added in .",
    "finally , to obtain quantitative results we need the value of the fourth generation ckm matrix elements @xmath77 . for this aim following [ 17 ] , we will use the experimental results of the decay @xmath78 together with @xmath79 to determine the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath80 .",
    "however , in order to reduce the uncertainties arising from b - quark mass , we consider the following ratio : @xmath81 in the leading logarithmic approximation this ratio can be summarized in a compact form as follows [ 18 ] : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the phase space factor in @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . in the case of four generation",
    "there is an additional contribution to @xmath86 from the virtual exchange of the fourth generation up quark @xmath2 .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the dipole operators are given by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 present the contributions of @xmath2 to the wilson coefficients , and @xmath80 are the fourth generation ckm matrix factor which we need now .",
    "with these wilson coefficients and the experiment results of the decays @xmath89 , together with the semileptonic @xmath90=@xmath91 [ 19,20 ] decay , we obtain the results of the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath92 .",
    "there exist two cases , a positive , and a negative one [ 17 ] : @xmath93 \\frac { v^{*}_{ts}v_{tb}}{c^{(new)}_{7}(m_{b})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the values for @xmath80 are listed in table 1 .",
    ".the numerical values of @xmath80 for different values of @xmath2 for @xmath94 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a few comments about the numerical values of @xmath95 are in order . from unitarity condition of the ckm matrix",
    "we have @xmath96 if the average values of the ckm matrix elements in the sm are used [ 20 ] , the sum of the first three terms in eq.(23 ) is about @xmath97 . substituting the value of @xmath98 from table 1",
    ", we observe that the sum of the four terms on the left - hand side of eq.(22 ) is closer to zero compared to the sm case , since @xmath98 is very close to the sum of the first three terms , but with opposite sign . on the other hand",
    "if we consider @xmath99 , whose value is about @xmath100 , which is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the previous case .",
    "however , it should be noted that the data for the ckm is not determined to very high accuracy , and the error in sum of the first three terms in eq.(20 ) is about @xmath101 .",
    "it is easy to see then that , the value of @xmath99 is within this error range . in summary both @xmath102 , and",
    "@xmath99 satisfy the unitarity condition of ckm , moreover , @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , from our numerical analysis one can not escape the conclusion that , the @xmath99 contribution to the physical quantities should be practically indistinguishable from sm results , and our numerical analysis confirms this expectation .",
    "we now go on to put the above points in perspective .",
    "to calculate the branching ratio in sm4 , and to study the influence of the fourth generation on the branching ratio @xmath104 , the following values have been used as input parameters : + @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 gev , @xmath108 gev , @xmath109=0.045 , and the lifetime is taken as @xmath110 s [ 20 ] .",
    "for illustrative purposes , the branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath111 decay as a function of @xmath112 for its different values of @xmath95 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath80 take positive values , i.e. @xmath99 , the branching ratio ( br ) is almost overlap with that of sm .",
    "that is , the results in sm4 are the same as that in sm , except a peak in the curve when @xmath112 takes values @xmath113 .",
    "the reason is not because there is new prediction deviation from sm , but only because of the second term of eq.(21 ) . in this case",
    ", it does not show the new effects of @xmath112 .",
    "also , we can not obtain the information of the existence of the fourth generation from the branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath111 , although we can not exclude them either .",
    "this is because , from table 1 , the values @xmath99 are positive .",
    "but they are of order @xmath114 , and is very small .",
    "the values of @xmath30 are about ten times larger than them @xmath115 , @xmath116 see ref . [",
    "but in the second case , when the values of @xmath80 are negative , i.e. @xmath102 , the curve of branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath56 , is quit different from that of the sm .",
    "this can be clearly seen from figure 1 .",
    "the enhancement of the branching ratio increases rapidly with the increasing of @xmath112 . in this case , the fourth generation effects are shown clearly .",
    "the reason is that @xmath102 is 2 - 3 times larger than @xmath30 so that the last term in eq.(21 ) becomes important , and it depends on the @xmath2 mass strongly .",
    "thus the effect of the fourth generation is significant . in figure 2 .",
    "we show the dependence of the differential branching ratio @xmath117/ds as functions of s ; @xmath118 , for @xmath112= 300 gev .",
    "it can be seen their that , when @xmath80 takes positive values , i.e. @xmath99 , the differential decay width is almost overlap with that of sm .",
    "that is , the results in sm4 are the same as that in sm , except a peak in the curve when @xmath119 .",
    "but in the second case , when the values of @xmath80 are negative , i.e @xmath102 .",
    "the curve of the differential decay width is quit different from that of the sm .",
    "this can be clearly seen from figure 2 .",
    "the enhancement of the differential decay width increases rapidly , and the energy spectrum of the @xmath60 meson is almost symmetrical . in figure 3 , the ratio @xmath120 is depicted as a function of @xmath95 for various values of @xmath112 .",
    "figure 3 shows that for all values of @xmath121 gev the value of r becomes greater than one . in the calculations we observed that at @xmath122 , the values of r become larger than one for both solutions @xmath95 , meaning that the value of r=1 is shifted . in other words , by defining the position for which r=1 , information can be obtained about @xmath112 the mass of the fourth generation fermion . for completeness",
    "we also consider the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "this ratio is plotted as a function of @xmath95 for various values of @xmath112 in figure 4 .",
    "it is well known that the inclusive decay width in the sm corresponds to @xmath124 is given as ( see [ 7 ] ) : @xmath125^{2}}{\\eta_{0}f(m_{c}/m_{b})}\\bar{\\eta}br ( b \\rightarrow x_{c } l\\nu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the theoretical uncertainties related to the b - quark mass dependence disappear . in eq.(24 )",
    "the factor 3 corresponds to the number of the light neutrinos .",
    "phase space factor @xmath126 , qcd correction factors @xmath127 , @xmath128@xmath129 [ 9 ] , and experimental measurement @xmath130 . finally , note that the results for @xmath131 decay can be easily obtained from @xmath0 if the following replacement is done in all equations : @xmath132 by @xmath133 and @xmath134 by @xmath135 . in obtaining these results , one must keep in mind that the values of the form factors for @xmath136 transition generally differ from that of the @xmath137 transition .",
    "however , these differences must be in the range of @xmath138 violation , namely in the order @xmath139",
