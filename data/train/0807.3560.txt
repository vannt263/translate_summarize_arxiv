    "it is well known that the disks of late - type galaxies are not completely flat .",
    "warping of the outer gas disk into an `` integral sign '' shape is a nearly ubiquitous feature of spiral galaxies , even those that appear to be quite isolated ( garca - ruiz et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of galaxies also have warped stellar disks ( snchez - saavedra et al .",
    "1990 ; reshetnikov & combes 1998 ) . for several decades",
    "it has been recognized that the  disk and other  components of the milky way exhibit an additional type of vertical structure in the form of systematic displacements from the mean plane known as `` corrugations '' ( e.g. , gum et al .",
    "1960 ; quiroga 1974,1977 ; lockman 1977 ; sanders et al . 1984 ) .",
    "these corrugations are present along both radial and azimuthal directions and have scales ranging from @xmath250 to 350  pc in amplitude and from one to several kiloparsecs in wavelength ( spicker & feitzinger 1986 ) .    despite predictions that corrugations may be a common phenomenon in disk galaxies , systematic searches for these features",
    "have been limited , and consequently , little has been known about their true frequency of occurrence in external galaxies . to date ,",
    "evidence of corrugations has been reported for only a handful of cases outside the milky way : in the emission nebulae of m31 ( arp 1964 ) , in the stellar ( optical ) light of three edge - on , late - type galaxies ( florido et al .",
    "1991,1992 ) , and in the velocity structure of the face - on spiral ngc  5427 ( alfaro et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the origin of disk corrugations is a matter of longstanding debate given the small number of galaxies in which they have so far been detected ( see the reviews by alfaro & efremov 1996 and alfaro 2003 ) .",
    "suggestions have included : gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , nelson 1976 ) ; tidal interactions ( edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) , collisions of high - velocity clouds with the disk ( franco et al .",
    "1988 ; santilln et al .",
    "1999 ) ; interaction of spiral waves with the gaseous disk ( alfaro et al .",
    "2001 ) ; and the undular mode of the parker instability ( franco et al . 2002 ) .",
    "depending on their origin , the presence or absence of corrugations can provide important clues into the role of magnetic fields on galaxy disk structure ( e.g. , spicker & feitzinger 1986 ; santilln et al .",
    "2000 ; franco et al . 2002 ) , the formation of molecular clouds ( e.g. , nelson & matsuda 1980 ) , the degree of self - gravity of galaxy disks ( e.g. , revaz & pfenniger 2004 ) , or the timescales of recent interactions ( e.g. , edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , current evidence suggests that whatever the physical process(es ) responsible for corrugations , they are closely linked to the mechanisms responsible for the formation of the dense gas condensations and therefore with the regulation of star formation ( e.g. , nelson & matsuda 1980 ; alfaro et al . 1992 ; alfaro & efremov 1996 ; alfaro 2003 ) .",
    "in a recent paper ( matthews & uson 2008 ; hereafter mu08 ) , we presented optical and imaging observations of the nearby , edge - on spiral galaxy ic  2233 .",
    "there we reported the discovery of a corrugated pattern in the  disk of this galaxy  i.e . , we found that the  layer of ic  2233 exhibits a remarkably regular pattern of positive and negative vertical displacements from the kinematically - defined midplane .",
    "this pattern has a wavelength of @xmath3 ( 7  kpc ) and an amplitude that increases with distance from the center of the galaxy , reaching a maximum of @xmath4 ( @xmath2150  pc ) .",
    "[ for comparison , the fwhm thickness of the  layer ranges from @xmath2@xmath5 near the disk center to @xmath2@xmath6 toward the outer disk ( mu08 ) ] .",
    "subsequently , we have explored the vertical structure of ic  2233 using a variety of additional tracers of the stellar and interstellar components of its disk .",
    "we have also examined the relationship between the peaks of the vertical  excursions with both  density enhancements along the disk and with velocity perturbations in the disk rotation curve . here",
    "we report the discovery of undular patterns in several additional  tracers in ic  2233 .",
    "in contrast , we find the vertical displacements are minimal in the old stars .",
    "we also report the discovery of a link between the locations of the peak excursions from the midplane in  with features in the  rotation curve . in   [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the origin of the disk corrugations seen in ic  2233 and other galaxies .",
    "ic  2233 is a bulgeless sd galaxy located at a distance of @xmath210  mpc .",
    "it has a moderately low surface brightness , `` superthin '' disk structure ( goad & roberts 1981 ) and a low current star formation rate ( @xmath7  yr@xmath8 ; mu08 ) .",
    "the transparency and structural simplicity of ic  2233 make it well - suited to a detailed vertical structure analysis .",
    "ic  2233 also appears to be a very isolated system ( mu08 ) , implying that its disk structure should be minimally affected by external perturbations .      to investigate the vertical structure of the  disk of ic  2233 , mu08 extracted a series of   intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk , spaced at regular intervals .",
    "these profiles were derived from an  total intensity image with a spatial resolution of @xmath9 . the position angle for the galaxy",
    "was taken to be 172@xmath10 , and the adopted center of the galaxy , ( @xmath11)=(0,0 ) , was the kinematic center established by mu08 : @xmath12 , @xmath13  @xmath14 .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the distance along the galaxy major axis , with values increasing toward the north , and @xmath16 is taken as the distance above the midplane , with positive values to the east . )",
    "mu08 fitted a single gaussian to each intensity slice and plotted the displacement of the computed centroid from the midplane ( @xmath16=0 ) as a function of distance along the major axis . the resulting `` corrugation curve '' for the  data",
    "is reproduced in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : corplots ] .",
    "the arrows on the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : corplots ] indicate the extent of the stellar disk of ic  2233 , as determined from the 25 magnitude arcsec@xmath17 @xmath18-band isophote . it can be seen that near the edge of the stellar disk , the  layer twists to form an `` integral sign '' warp . on the side of the disk where the  layer is more extended",
    ", the layer bends back toward the midplane at larger radii .",
    "however , at small and intermediate projected radii , regular undulations are clearly visible across the disk of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that a portion of the galaxy near @xmath19 is displaced from the kinematically - defined center - of - mass .",
    "one possible explanation is that this is linked with the presence of an inner bar .    to insure that our derived  corrugation curve is not significantly impacted by optical depth effects ,",
    "we have compared  intensity profiles extracted from channel images with 16@xmath20 resolution ( presented in mu08 ) with the corresponding ones made with more uniform weighting of the raw visibilities ( i.e. , with a robustness parameter @xmath21 = @xmath22 ) , which leads to images with @xmath23 resolution , albeit with rms noise about 40% higher .",
    "we find that the respective profiles and centroids agree to within the errors , although the higher resolution images resolve out some of the more diffuse component .",
    "the peak  brightness temperatures are @xmath24  k for the @xmath23 images and @xmath25  k for the @xmath26 images , respectively , near the position of the kinematic center of ic  2233 and at the systemic velocity .",
    "examination of the profiles shows that the  is optically thin with @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the generally excellent agreement between the  and h@xmath28  rotation curves ( see figure  13 of mu08 ) .    to better constrain the nature and origin of the corrugations in ic  2233",
    ", we have now extended our analysis of its vertical disk structure using a number of additional data sets , spanning far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) to far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths ( table  1 ) . for each wavelength ,",
    "we have computed a corrugation curve in a manner analogous to that used for the  data .",
    "the results are presented in electronic form in table  2 .",
    "we have compared the positions of background radio sources and foreground stars with catalogued values from the nrao vla sky survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the tycho reference catalogue ( h@xmath29 g et al .",
    "2000 ) , respectively . with the exception of the 70@xmath30 m and 160@xmath30 m images ( where no foreground or background sources useful for registration were detected )",
    ", we find that astrometric registration between images at different wavelengths is accurate to within a small fraction of a resolution element .",
    "therefore , we assume that astrometric uncertainties do not impact our results unless explicitly noted .",
    "because of the low surface brightness nature of ic  2233 , we have also assumed that optical depth effects have a minimal impact on our analysis at all available wavelengths .",
    "above we noted that the optical depth of the galaxy is extremely low . at visible wavelengths",
    "the optical depth of ic  2233 also appears to be minimal .",
    "mu08 estimated the @xmath18-band extinction toward the center of the galaxy to be @xmath20.7 magnitudes , but this is likely to be an upper limit , as fits to the radial surface brightness profiles of ic  2233 show that the light distribution is more strongly peaked than predicted by a simple exponential disk model , and both the wiyn images published by mu08 and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images published by seth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reveal that there are very few optically thick dust clumps in this galaxy and no true dust lane .",
    "because of this , optical depth effects are expected to be negligible in all of the _ spitzer _ bands .",
    "the optical depth of ic  2233 at uv wavelengths is more uncertain .",
    "however , better characterization of this will require detailed radiative transfer modelling ( see e.g. , matthews & wood 2001 ) and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "gaps in the corrugation plots near @xmath37 at some wavelengths are due to contamination from a foreground star .",
    "figure  [ fig : corplots ] illustrates that excursions from the midplane of up to @xmath38 ( @xmath1250  pc ) are present in a variety of tracers in ic  2233 . in the case of the mid - infrared ( 3.6@xmath30 m and 4.5@xmath30 m ) continuum ,",
    "these highest - amplitude excursions occur only at the edges of the disk and can be attributed to the disk warp ; however , at all other wavelengths shown in figure  [ fig : corplots ] , undulations with amplitudes of up to @xmath38 are present at low and intermediate projected radii along the disk .",
    "none of these vertical undulations are as regular as those observed in ; nonetheless , some interesting relationships emerge between the patterns seen in various tracers .    in the southern portion of the galaxy ( i.e. , along negative @xmath15 values ) , we see that tracers of young to intermediate - age stellar populations ( nuv , fuv , h@xmath28 , and @xmath32-band ) bend away from the plane with the same sign and comparable amplitude to that observed in  ( @xmath39 ) . for the nuv and fuv light ,",
    "there is some hint of a slight phase lag with respect to the  curve .",
    "this correlation is largely maintained in the northern portion of the galaxy , to roughly @xmath40 .",
    "in contrast , further north ( @xmath41 ) , the vertical structure of these tracers diverges sharply from what is seen in ; here , excursions are observed toward positive @xmath16 , while the  layer bends toward negative @xmath16 values . only beyond @xmath42 do the vertical centroids again converge to values similar to those observed in .",
    "visual inspection of the uv , @xmath32-band , and h@xmath28  images suggests that higher frequency undulations may also be present in these bands .",
    "these are difficult to quantitatively characterize , but may account for some of the scatter seen in these tracers .",
    "turning toward tracers of the dust component in ic  2233 , vertical undulations are also clearly visible .",
    "the corrugation curve derived from the 8@xmath30 m light ( believed to be dominated by pah emission ) exhibits a pattern comparable in shape to the  data , but with larger dispersion .",
    "both the 24@xmath30 m and the 70@xmath30 m corrugation curves also show close agreement with the  data over much of the disk . the exception is the region between @xmath43 where the 24@xmath30 m and 70@xmath30 m emission diverge sharply from the .",
    "in other galaxies both the 8@xmath30 m and 70@xmath30 m emission have been found to have distributions similar to the  gas ( e.g. , helou et al .",
    "2001 ; walter et al .",
    "2007 ) , although the pah emission tends to correlate more closely with the molecular gas and cold dust , while the 70@xmath30 m tends to be most prominent in the highest  column density regions .",
    "the vertical structure of the cool dust traced by the 160@xmath30 m light shows relatively little correlation with any other wavelength .",
    "our sensitivity is too limited to detect the outer @xmath220% of the galaxy at this wavelength , and in addition , the low resolution of these data ( @xmath44 ) makes the uncertainty in the location of the zero point comparable to the amplitude of the vertical excursions .",
    "nonetheless , the data are clearly inconsistent with a flat , planar distribution for the cool dust . on the northern side of the galaxy",
    ", the 160@xmath30 m emission appears qualitatively similar to the 70@xmath30 m emission , although the amplitude of the vertical excursions appears larger . on the southern side of the disk , the 160@xmath30 m emission appears to be anticorrelated with the  ( and with all the other tracers ) . convolving and resampling the 70@xmath30 m image to match the resolution and pixel size of the 160@xmath30 m data",
    ", we were unable to reproduce either of these trends from resolution effects alone .",
    "the divergent behavior between several of the  tracers on the northern side of ic  2233 complicates the description of the galaxy as a simple undulating plane .",
    "while projection effects due to warping or to the different radial extents of various tracers may make some contribution to these differences , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that these effects should be more severe on the northern side of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the observed differences between the vertical displacements of different disk components should offer some clues on the origin of the corrugation patterns and their possible link to the regulation of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "for this reason , we now examine some of these differences in greater detail .    visual inspection of the uv , @xmath32 , and h@xmath28  images between @xmath45-@xmath46 reveals that the vertical intensity profiles in these bands are dominated by the light associated with a smattering of compact  regions located several arcseconds above the plane .",
    "the brightest of these ( near @xmath47 ) has counterparts at 24@xmath30 m and 70@xmath30 m .",
    "interestingly , this position also corresponds to the location of the only major disparity between the   and h@xmath28  rotation curves for the ic  2233 ; here , the h@xmath28  curve dips toward the systemic velocity by @xmath2  35  ( see figure  13 of mu08 ) .",
    "this difference between the  and h@xmath28  rotation curves suggests that either there is an absence of ionized gas at the tangent point along this line - of - sight , or else that the ionized material along this direction has been kinematically perturbed .",
    "the former scenario seems more likely given that we detect significant  emission near @xmath48 at the same velocity as the h@xmath28  emission ( see figure  11 of mu08 ) .",
    "however , the second possibility can not be ruled out ( see also   [ tides ] ) .    in the  total intensity image of ic  2233",
    ", we see a distinct  clump near @xmath49 that is visibly displaced toward negative @xmath16 values ( figure  1 ) .",
    "tracers of hot young stars ( fuv , nuv , h@xmath28 , @xmath32-band ) all show a depressed surface brightness at the corresponding location , although we do detect counterparts to the  clump at 8.0@xmath30 m , 24@xmath30 m , 70@xmath30 m , and 100@xmath30 m .",
    "this dearth of starlight coupled with the presence of fir emission suggests that this sight - line may intersect a young star - forming region where the gas is still predominantly cold and dense .",
    "recent studies show that pah emission tends to be a good proxy for dense molecular gas in quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , haas et al .",
    "2002 ; paladino et al .",
    "2008 ) , while emission at longer ir wavelengths can be a hallmark of hot young stellar objects that are still highly embedded .",
    "the disparity between the vertical structure of different  tracers near this location thus could be partly a consequence of this region being at an earlier evolutionary state compared with some of the other optically prominent star - forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "models for the origin of structural corrugations in disk galaxies also predict corrugations in the velocity field ( see alfaro et al . 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity corrugations and the relationship between velocity and structural corrugations can in principle be used to distinguish between various models for their origin .",
    "unfortunately , with the exception of the milky way , it is difficult to measure both types of corrugations in the same galaxy .    to explore whether any systematic patterns are discernible in the velocity field of ic  2233 ,",
    "we have re - examined the observed  rotation curve from mu08 .",
    "we have parameterized the approaching and receding sides of the curve with a brandt ( 1960 ) function of the form :    @xmath50 \\left[\\frac{1}{3 } + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{x}{x_{\\rm max}}\\right)^n\\right]^{\\frac{-3~}{2n}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51  , @xmath5285.0  , @xmath53=@xmath54 , and @xmath55=1.09 . a comparison with this type of smooth , idealized curve can help to highlight subtle , systematic excursions from the expected circular velocity at a given radius . in figure",
    "[ fig : velres ] we plot the residual velocity difference between the observed rotation curve and the brandt model as a function of distance along the major axis .",
    "the dashed sections of the curve designate the portions of the  disk where warping dominates the vertical structure ( see above ) .",
    "the residual curve in figure  [ fig : velres ] reveals that the observed radial velocities along the ic  2233 disk exhibit systematic positive and negative excursions from the brandt model , with amplitudes of @xmath565  .",
    "this type of systematic `` waviness '' has been seen previously in the rotation curves of other disk galaxies , particularly those with spiral arms ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1963 ; pimi 1965 ; fridman et al .",
    "1998 ; alfaro et al 2001 ) .",
    "however , what is particularly striking in the case of ic  2233 is that the locations of the local minima and maxima in the residual velocity curve correspond closely to the locations of the peak vertical structural excursions observed in the  gas .",
    "as noted above , a number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed corrugations in disk galaxies .",
    "we now discuss the suitability of several of these mechanisms for explaining the observed corrugations in ic  2233 .",
    "numerical modelling by edelsohn & elmegreen ( 1997 ) demonstrated that tidal interactions with a low - mass companion are one means of producing a corrugated disk structure . in this model ,",
    "the companion generates a spiral - shaped wave that propagates inwards from the edge of the disk , resulting in perpendicular motions . although the simulations of edelsohn & elmegreen were performed for a milky way - like galaxy and a perturber roughly 8% as massive , the results exhibit qualitative similarities to our observations of ic  2233 .",
    "however , mu08 found that ic  2233 appears to be an extremely isolated galaxy , exhibiting no obvious signs of a recent interaction or minor merger .",
    "this casts significant doubt upon tidal effects as being the primary driver of the vertical disk structure of ic  2233 .",
    "in addition , since tidally induced corrugations are excited from the outer regions of the disk ( see edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) , this does not provide a natural explanation for the `` null '' seen at the kinematic center of ic  2233 ( see   [ data ] and figure  [ fig : corplots ] ) .",
    "interestingly , at least one of the galaxies found by florido et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to have disk corrugations ( ngc  4244 ) , also appears to be quite isolated ( dahlem et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a search for corrugations in additional isolated systems , coupled with deep searches for low - mass companions , could provide better statistical constraints on the likely role of companions in exciting corrugated patterns .",
    "while an intrusion from a companion galaxy seems unlikely in the case of ic  2233 , the influence of impacts from very low - mass perturbers ( @xmath57 ) , such as high - velocity clouds , can not be entirely ruled out . based on their energetics ,",
    "high - velocity cloud impacts were the explanation favored by alfaro et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to account for vertical displacements of the midplane of the milky way and their associated star formation activity ( see also franco et al .",
    "moreover , ic  2233 is known to have a vertically extended  component that is kinematically distinct from the main disk component ( mu08 ) , and whose presence suggests that the circulation of  material between the plane and higher galactocentric latitudes is actively occurring ( e.g. , fraternali & binney 2008 ) . while it would be difficult to explain how a _",
    "corrugation structure as regular as that seen in the  disk of ic  2233 could be explained by a series of cloud impacts , such events may help to account for _ local _ vertical displacements and offsets between certain disk components .",
    "for example , such an event offers one possible explanation for the differences in the vertical structure of various disk tracers that is observed over a portion of the northern half of ic  2233 as well as the perturbation in the h@xmath28rotation curve observed near this position ( see   [ results ] ) .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : velres ] seem to exclude another class of model for explaining the vertical meanderings of the ic  2233 disk .",
    "in particular , our findings appear to be inconsistent with a scenario where corrugations result from gas being hydraulically `` lifted '' off the plane by a spiral arm as a result of interaction of the spiral density wave with a thick , magnetized , gas disk ( martos & cox 1998 ) . in this so - called `` galactic bore '' model",
    ", the lifting effect is expected to show an even symmetry about midplane ( see alfaro et al .",
    "2001 ) , resulting in some thickening of the plane and no net velocity excursions in an edge - on galaxy .",
    "in contrast to the galactic bore picture , the undular mode of the parker ( 1966 ) instability in a thick , magnetized gas disk predicts a velocity pattern similar to that seen in figure  [ fig : velres ] ( see franco et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , an additional prediction of this model is that density enhancements should be present at the locations of maximum deviation from the mean plane ( e.g. , hanawa 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , such a trend has been observed in the corrugated carina - sagittarius arm of the galaxy ( franco et al .",
    "2002 ) . while ic  2233 does show a series of  density enhancements along its disk ( mu08 ) , we find no clear correlation between the locations of these clumps and the maxima in the corrugated pattern in the  disk .",
    "because corrugations resulting from the undular mode of the parker instability occur along the azimuthal direction , line - of - sight integration effects may make it more difficult to match the location of density enhancements and vertical displacements in an edge - on galaxy .",
    "however , for the case of ic  2233 , the parker instability model encounters an additional challenge in that magnetic fields in small spiral galaxies with rotational velocities comparable to ic  2233 are typically quite weak ( e.g. , chy .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the observation that the corrugated structure of ic  2233 is more pronounced in the younger stellar components than in the old stars would seem to argue against a purely gravitational origin for the corrugations , since both gas and stars will be influenced by gravity . however , gas is in general more dynamically responsive than stars owing to its dissipative nature and its lower velocity dispersion ( e.g. , kim & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , gaseous distortions may be amplified by self - gravity and/or magnetic effects ( e.g , edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "even if the corrugations have a purely gravitational origin , it is not entirely unexpected to find the largest amplitude corrugations in the gaseous components of the galaxy . in this picture , the youngest stars ( which still reside near their birth locations ) would be expected to exhibit a corrugated structure , while dynamical evolution and heating would slowly erode these signatures in the older stars .    to determine whether an origin for the corrugations in ic  2233 via gaseous instabilities is feasible , it is valuable to compare the ages of the stellar populations participating in the corrugations with relevant dynamical timescales in the disk .",
    "for example , using equation 6 - 85 from binney and tremaine ( 1987 ) , we can estimate the oscillation period , @xmath58 , for stars in the disk of ic  2233 . assuming a mass equal to the dynamical mass of the galaxy ( @xmath59 ) , a disk radius of 9.2  kpc , and a maximum rotational velocity @xmath60  ( mu08 ) , then at intermediate galactocentric radii ( near @xmath61=4.5  kpc ) , we find @xmath62  years .",
    "this is comparable to the lifetime of an  region , implying that the hot young stars giving rise to these ionized regions must be born near their present off - planar locations .",
    "if the corrugations arise initially in the gas , then the presence of corrugations in the nuv and fuv light ( corresponding to stars with ages @xmath31 years ) implies that the midplane deviations need to persist for only a few oscillation periods to be visible in these bands . the mix of stars dominating the @xmath32-band light in ic  2233 is more uncertain , although the very blue color of this galaxy ( @xmath63=0.67 ; mu08 ) suggests that this band may too be weighted toward moderately young stars , with ages no more than a few oscillation periods .",
    "as discussed by fridman & polyachenko ( 1984 ) , vertical displacements in a galactic disk may arise from two types of internal gravitational mechanisms : spiral density waves and vertical bending oscillations ( see also fridman et al .",
    "variations of both types of mechanisms could be linked with disk corrugations , even in galaxies with negligible magnetic fields .",
    "for example , nelson ( 1976 ) suggested that corrugations could arise from the perturbations of a spiral potential on a differentially rotating gas layer ( see also nelson & matsuda 1980 ) , while masset & tagger ( 1997 ) postulated that their origin could be the result of a non - linear coupling between a spiral density wave and two so - called `` warp waves '' . in the model of masset & tagger , a transmitted wave results in an integral sign warp , while a reflected wave produces corrugations .",
    "several arguments suggest that ic  2233 is likely to exhibit at least rudimentary spiral structure ( see mu08 ) , but unfortunately its edge - on orientation makes it impossible to discern the details of this spiral pattern and thus to examine any possible relationship to the observed corrugations .",
    "vertical bending oscillations in galaxy disks have been explored by various authors as a possible origin for galaxy warps ( e.g. , sellwood 1996 ; revaz & pfenniger 2004 ) , but to our knowledge , relatively little attention has been paid to these oscillations as a possible origin of disk corrugations ( although see sparke 1995 ; fridman et al .",
    "1998 ; griv & chiueh 1998 ) . while the sophisticated numerical simulations needed to explore this phenomenon are beyond the scope of the present paper , we point to the results of some existing studies that suggest that such an exploration might be fruitful .",
    "for example , in certain galaxy disk models , sellwood ( 1996 ) found higher order bending modes whose amplitude and wavelength are reminiscent of the corrugation pattern of ic  2233 ( e.g. , his figure  1d ) , although it remains to be explored how these results would translate to a disk containing both gas and stars .",
    "more recently , revaz & pfenniger ( 2004 ) used multi - component disk models to show that bending instabilities can be long - lived ( i.e. , persisting through several rotations ) provided that disks have sufficient self - gravity . in their models",
    "it is assumed that some portion of the galaxy s dark matter resides in the disk rather than in a halo .",
    "revaz & pfenniger explored only the low - order ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) bending modes relevant to producing galaxy warps ; however , a search for higher - order modes , as well as an extension of their models to include the dissipational behavior of the gas would be of interest .",
    "we have presented a multi - wavelength analysis of the vertical structure of the late - type , edge - on galaxy ic  2233 .",
    "systematic excursions from the mean plane with amplitude @xmath0 ( @xmath2250  pc ) are observed in a variety of tracers in this galaxy , including the neutral hydrogen gas , the young stars , the  regions , and dust components of various temperatures .",
    "this corrugated pattern appears most regular in the gas , and is absent from the old stars traced by the mid - infrared light .    over a significant fraction of ic  2233 ,",
    "the vertical deviations observed in a variety of  tracers show similar signs and amplitudes .",
    "a notable exception occurs along the disk region between @xmath66-@xmath46 , thus complicating the interpretation of the corrugation pattern in terms of a simple , global pattern .",
    "one contribution to the differences seen along this region could be variations in the filling factors for various disk tracers .",
    "star - forming sites may also have different spectral energy distributions depending on their ages , with the youngest being dim at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "a third possibility is that perturbations ( such as impacts from infalling gas clouds ) may locally influence the vertical structure of the disk . despite these complexities",
    ", we find that the locations of maximum deviation from the plane in the gas correspond to perturbations in the  rotation curve with amplitude @xmath67  .",
    "a number of different scenarios have been suggested in the past literature to account for the corrugated structure in disk galaxies , and we have evaluated their applicability to the case of ic  2233 .",
    "models invoking tidal interactions with a companion , parker instabilities , or a galactic bore all encounter significant challenges in explaining the radial , galaxy - wide structural and velocity corrugations of ic  2233 .",
    "models involving gravitational instabilities of the gas layer appear to be more promising .",
    "however , sophisticated numerical modelling will be needed to evaluate such models further .",
    "the presence of a corrugated structure in this rather low surface brightness galaxy implies that vigorous star formation is not a necessary condition for the appearance of complex vertical structure in the disks of galaxies .",
    "indeed , the quiescent nature of ic  2233 coupled with its low star formation density is undoubtedly an important factor in allowing us to observe the correspondence between vertical structures at a variety of wavelengths despite our edge - on viewing angle .",
