    "electron decoherence is one of the key ingredients of the many - body ground state in the presence of disorder and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the existing non - perturbative theory of this phenomenon at low temperatures in realistic disordered conductors @xcite is rather complicated , to a large extent because of the necessity to properly account for fermi statistics for interacting electrons . at the same time",
    "the main physical reason for electron dephasing appears obvious already without unnecessary technical details : it is the electron interaction with the fluctuating quantum electromagnetic field produced by other electrons moving in a disordered potential .    in order to be able to quantitatively",
    "describe and understand the latter effect guinea @xcite suggested a model which mimics all essential features of the `` real '' problem of interacting electrons in a disordered conductor except for the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this model describes a quantum particle moving on a ring with radius @xmath3 and interacting with quantum dissipative environment . for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium quantum decoherence manifests itself as effective suppression of off - diagonal density matrix elements beyond a certain length @xmath1 .",
    "provided there exists nonzero electron dephasing due to its interaction with quantum environment at @xmath2 , this dephasing length @xmath1 should stay finite down to zero temperature .",
    "hence , all effects sensitive to quantum coherence , such as , e.g. , persistent currents ( pc ) and aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations in mesoscopic rings , should be suppressed by interactions as soon as the ring perimeter @xmath4 exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "a great deal of information can be obtained by modelling the environment by a bath of caldeira - leggett ( cl ) oscillators . in this case",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that pc is reduced by interactions _ in the ground state _ implying suppression of quantum coherence exactly at @xmath5 .",
    "for the same cl environment guinea @xcite found that ab oscillations for a quantum particle on a ring are suppressed by the factor @xmath6 , where the length @xmath1 is set by interactions and remains finite down to @xmath5 .",
    "a similar result was also obtained earlier from the real - time analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the problem @xcite is exactly equivalent to that of coulomb blockade in the so - called single electron box where exponential reduction of the effective charging energy at large conductances @xcite is presently considered as a well established result .",
    "thus , it is now widely accepted that pc for a quantum particle on a ring is exponentially reduced at large ring perimeters down to @xmath5 due to strong dephasing produced by interaction between the particle and the cl bath .",
    "it appears that presently no such consensus exists for another important model of the environment @xcite formed by a diffusive electron gas .",
    "renormalization group arguments developed for this model @xcite suggest very weak power law @xmath7 suppression of ab oscillations at @xmath8 , where the factor @xmath9 is set by interactions . on the contrary , the combination of semiclassics , instanton technique and quantum monte carlo ( mc ) analysis @xcite yields much stronger suppression of quantum coherence , namely exponential suppression @xmath10 ( with temperature independent @xmath1 ) at not too low @xmath11 and power law suppression @xmath12 with @xmath13 at @xmath8 and for @xmath14 .",
    "more recently this problem was reconsidered by means of variational approach @xcite , perturbation theory @xcite and mc simulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ref . , either no @xcite or very weak @xcite @xmath3-dependent suppression of pc was found .",
    "note , however , that the variational calculation @xcite reduces the pc problem to that of mass renormalization in the @xmath15 topological sector while , as we show here , pc is determined by other topological sectors ( @xmath16 ) that are distinct from the @xmath15 sector , unlike the variational result in ref . .",
    "perturbative in the interaction calculations @xcite can also miss the correct behavior of pc at not too small @xmath3 as it was already demonstrated in ref .",
    "for the problem under consideration and was also discussed elsewhere in a broader context @xcite .",
    "more arguments along the same lines will be presented below in this paper .",
    "as far as numerical mc results are concerned , the authors @xcite ascribed the difference between their conclusions and those of the previous work @xcite to insufficient trotter number values employed in the mc analysis @xcite .",
    "while this particular issue definitely requires further analysis , it is worth pointing out that the mc data @xcite cover only the perturbative regime @xmath17 where rather weak suppression of pc was found in ref .",
    "as well , cf .",
    "fig . 3 in that paper .",
    "hence , mc results @xcite for small @xmath3 do not appear conclusive for the most interesting non - perturbative regime @xmath18 where strong ( though weaker than exponential ) interaction - induced suppression of pc was predicted @xcite down to @xmath8 .    leaving detailed discussion of mc procedure and results to the future , here we note that  despite significant theoretical activity in the field ",
    "currently no well - controlled non - perturbative approach is available which would allow to analytically study pc for the `` particle + dirty electron gas '' model @xcite in the low temperature limit and at sufficiently large values of @xmath3 . given both fundamental importance of the problem and remaining controversies in the literature , it is highly desirable to formulate such an approach which would unambiguously resolve the whole issue .",

    "2 we define our model which is essentially identical to that pioneered by guinea @xcite except we additionally introduce a periodic potential for the particle on a ring . in sec .",
    "3 we formulate our main formalism and evaluate persistent current in the ring without interactions by means of the standard instanton technique .",
    "this approach is conveniently generalized to the interacting regime in sec . 4 where we analyze suppression of both quantum coherence and pc by coulomb interaction at sufficiently low temperatures down to @xmath8 and arbitrarily large ring perimeters",

    "it is worthwhile to stress that exponential dependence of pc on @xmath3 of the form @xmath235 by itself does not yet necessarily imply decoherence .",

    "both these methods yield the same conclusion : although fermi statistics is crucially important for other properties of a dirty interacting electron gas , it practically _ does not affect _ interaction - induced quantum decoherence at @xmath8 .",
    "quantitative agreement was demonstrated @xcite between the corresponding results derived for the models with @xcite and without @xcite the pauli principle .    despite all these developments ( including recently obtained _ exact _ solution of the problem @xcite ) it is sometimes argued in the literature that the pauli principle can preclude from electron decoherence at @xmath8 . e.g. this conclusion was reached on the basis of the first order perturbation theory in the interaction @xcite .",
