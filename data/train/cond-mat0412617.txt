    "polymers with contour length @xmath2 much larger than the persistence length @xmath3 , which is the correlation length for the tangent - tangent correlation function along the polymer and is quantitative measure of the polymer stiffness , are flexible and are described by using the tools of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "if the chain length decreases , the chain stiffness becomes an important factor .",
    "many polymer molecules have internal stiffness and can not be modelled by the model of flexible polymers developed by edwards @xcite .",
    "the standard coarse - graining model of a worm - like polymer was proposed by kratky and porod @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredients of this model is the penalty for bending energy , and the local inextensibility .",
    "the latter make the treatment of the model much more difficult .",
    "there is a substantial amount of studies of the kratky - porod model in the last half century @xcite-@xcite ( and the references therein ) . in recent years",
    "there is an increasing interest in theoretical description of semiflexible polymers @xcite-@xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "a reason for this interest is due to potential applications of semiflexible polymers in biology and in researches on semi - crystalline polymers . in this article",
    "we present results of the study of the behaviour of the worm - like chain for short lengths .",
    "the consideration is based on our recent work @xcite,@xcite , where the fourier - laplace transform @xmath4 of the end - to - end distribution function @xmath0 ( @xmath5 is the laplace conjugate to @xmath1 ) was represented as the matrix element of the infinite order matrix @xmath6 with matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 related to the spectrum of the quantum rigid rotator .",
    "a truncation of @xmath9 by matrix of order @xmath10 gives the end - to - end distribution function @xmath4 as a rational function being an infinite series in powers of @xmath11 , i.e. it contains all moments of the end - to - end distribution function , and describes the first @xmath12 moments exactly . in context of eigenstates of the quantum rigid rotator , the truncation at order @xmath10 takes into account the eigenstates with quantum number of the angular momentum up to the value @xmath13 .",
    "the moment expansion of @xmath4 can be represented as double series in powers of @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , one can expand @xmath15 in double series in powers of @xmath11 and @xmath1 . analyzing the series of known moments ( we have analytically calculated the first @xmath16 moments )",
    ", we have established that the coefficients in subseries in powers of @xmath11 have a simple analytical structure , which enables one to perform a partial resummation of the moment expansion of @xmath4 or @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "this resummation procedure results in an expansion of @xmath18 around the stiff rod limit , where the end - to - end distribution function is given by the expression , @xmath19 , so that because @xmath20 is a distribution , so derived short - chain expansion is not a taylor expansion but rather an expansion in the space of distributions .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath15 enables one to compute directly the scattering function @xmath21 and the extension - force relation  @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we present the results of the calculation of terms of the short - chain expansions of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and  @xmath22 by taking into account the deviations of the moments from their stiff rod behaviour to the seven order in chain length @xmath1 .",
    "the procedure can be extended to higher orders .",
    "the short - chain expansions besides the interest in their own can be used for comparisons with approximative treatments , and also in studies of the behaviour of short semiflexible polymers .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ formalism ] introduces to the description of the worm - like chain using the formalism of quantum rigid rotator .",
    "section [ short - ch ] explains the idea of the derivation of the short - chain expansion , and presents the short - chain expansions for the distribution function of the end - to - end distance , scattering function , and extension - force relation .",
    "the fourier transform of the distribution function of the end - to - end polymer distance of the continuous kratky - porod model @xcite @xmath23 is expressed by the path integral as follows @xmath24where @xmath25 is the persistence length , and @xmath26 is the tangent vector at the point @xmath27 along the contour of the polymer . the product over @xmath27 in eq.([w1 ] ) takes into account that the polymer chain is locally inextensible . in the following the arc length of the polymer @xmath2 will be measured in units of @xmath28 and will be denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "we now will consider the green s function @xmath29 associated with eq.([w1 ] ) .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath30 is@xmath31where @xmath32 is the potential energy of the rigid rotator in an external field @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is measured in units of @xmath35 .",
    "the end - to - end distribution function is obtained from @xmath36 as follows @xmath37the differential equation ( [ w4 ] ) can be rewritten as an integral equation as follows@xmath38where the bare green s function @xmath39 reads @xmath40with @xmath41 being the spherical harmonics , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the quantum numbers of the angular momentum . due to the convolution character of the expression ( [ w5 ] ) with respect to the integration over the contour length ( @xmath44 depends on the difference @xmath45 ) ,",
    "the laplace transform of @xmath36 in eq.([w5 ] ) with respect to @xmath1 permits to get rid of integrations over the contour length .",
    "thus , in the following we will consider the laplace transform of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite,@xcite that the solution of eq.([w5 ] ) results in the following expression of the fourier - laplace transform of the end - to - end distribution function as the matrix element of an infinite order square matrix @xmath46with @xmath47where the square matrices @xmath48 and @xmath7 are defined by@xmath49with @xmath50 , and @xmath51respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath27 specifies that the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath48 are square matrices .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 denotes the @xmath54 matrix element of the infinite order square matrix @xmath52 .",
    "since the @xmath54 matrix element corresponds to the expectation value of the quantum rigid rotator in the ground state with the quantum number @xmath55 , we prefer to use the above notation .",
    "summations over the magnetic quantum number in the intermediate states in the expression of @xmath4 obtained by solving eq.([w5 ] ) can be eliminated @xcite , so that summations in the intermediate states occur only over the eigenvalues of the angular momentum @xmath56 .",
    "this is the reason why the calculation of @xmath4 reduces to the computation of the matrix element of an infinite order square matrix .    the quantity @xmath57 plays the key role in the theory similar to the bare propagator in common quantum field theories .",
    "the end - to - end distribution function @xmath4 is simply the matrix element @xmath58 , the scattering function of the polymer is the inverse laplace transform of @xmath59 multiplied by @xmath60 , the partition function of the stretched polymer is @xmath61 etc @xcite .",
    "to derive the short - chain expansion for the kratky - porod chain we insert the expansion of @xmath7 given by eq.([w10 ] ) according to@xmath62into the moment expansion of  @xmath4@xmath63and obtain as a result @xmath4 as double series in powers of ( @xmath64 and @xmath14 as follows@xmath65the analysis of @xmath16 exactly computed moments of @xmath66 , which are proportional to the coefficients @xmath67 in eq.([mom - exp ] ) , shows that the coefficients @xmath68 are polynomials in powers of @xmath10 of the order @xmath69 , i.e. they have the form @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we determine the coefficients @xmath72 at given @xmath27 using @xmath69 known terms of the moment expansion .",
    "further we test the correctness of so obtained @xmath68 from the comparison with the remaining known terms in the moment expansion , which were not used to determine @xmath72 .",
    "the exact knowledge of @xmath16 moments enables one to determine @xmath68 for @xmath73 . the coefficients @xmath74 we have obtained in this way are@xmath75we have also computed the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 , but do not write them here to save space .",
    "the determination of higher coefficients demands the knowledge of more moments of the end - to - end distribution function and can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "after the determination of the coefficients @xmath68 we have checked the equivalence of ( w12 ) with ( [ mom - exp ] ) to the corresponding order .",
    "unfortunately , we did not succeed in deriving the expression for the coefficients @xmath68 for arbitrary @xmath27 .    with known coefficients @xmath68 one can sum the series over @xmath10 in ( w12 ) . restricting ourselves to the leading order @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is the number of terms in the sum over @xmath27 in ( [ w12 ] ) ) we obtain @xmath15 @xmath80and the distribution function of the end - to - end distance @xmath81 in the stiff rod limit .",
    "taking into account the next term in the sum over @xmath27 in eq.([w12 ] ) gives the correction to the stiff rod limit of the end - to - end distribution function .",
    "thus , the resummation of the moment expansion of @xmath4 according to ( [ w12 ] ) yields the short - chain expansion for kratky - porod chain .    the above derivation does not allow to make claims on the convergence of the short - chain expansion .",
    "the comparison of results of computations of quantities under consideration ( for example the scattering function or deformation - force relation ) for different @xmath82 gives a criterion determining the quality of the short - chain expansion .",
    "notice that alternatively one can first carry out the inverse laplace transform of ( [ mom - exp ] ) , and then expand the moments in taylor series in powers of @xmath1 . as a result one will arrive at double series similar to ( [ w12 ] ) with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath1 .",
    "this makes more clear the meaning of the resummation procedure . to leading order ( @xmath78 )",
    "one replaces the moments by its stiff rod behaviour , @xmath83 . in the next to",
    "leading order ( @xmath84 ) one takes into account the next - order corrections to the stiff rod behaviour of all moments , and so on .    due to the fact that the scattering function of the semiflexible polymer @xmath85 is the inverse laplace transform of @xmath59 multiplied with the factor @xmath60 , the short - chain expansion of @xmath4 enables one to get the short - chain expansion of the scattering function .",
    "in fact , hermans and ullman @xcite derived the stiff rod limit of the scattering function using the stiff rod limit of the moments .    in following subsections",
    "we will consider separately the short - chain expansion of the end - to - end distribution function , the scattering function , and the extension - force relation , which also can be obtained from @xmath17 .",
    "the series over @xmath10 in ( [ w12 ] ) for known coefficients @xmath68 can be easily expressed through the derivatives of the geometric series .",
    "carrying out the inverse laplace transform over @xmath5 gives the short - chain expansion of @xmath15 .",
    "we have computed @xmath15 by taking into account eight terms in the sum over @xmath27 in ( [ w12 ] ) i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "to save place we present below the result for @xmath87@xmath88the subscript at @xmath89 and at quantities below is @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath90 tends to one for @xmath91 , the end - to - end distribution function is normalized .",
    "it is easily to see that the terms in ( [ gkn ] ) can be represented as derivatives of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath1 i.e. of @xmath93 .",
    "the short - chain expansion of the distribution function of the end - to - end distance is then immediately obtained from ( [ gkn ] ) as @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the kth derivative of the dirac s delta - function .",
    "note that @xmath0 is a distribution function with respect to @xmath96 , while the contour length @xmath1 is a parameter .",
    "this should be taken into account in using eq.([grn ] ) to compute different mean values , for example the moments of the end - to - end distribution function of a short chain .",
    "similar to the corresponding expansion of the function @xmath97 in powers of @xmath98 , the short - chain expansion of @xmath0 can not be interpreted as a taylor series but is rather a generalized taylor expansion in space of distributions .",
    "the expansions ( [ gkn]-[grn ] ) can be used to test approximative expressions of the end - to - end distribution function .",
    "we did not succeed so far to convert the short - chain expansion of the distribution function to a close expression .",
    "the scattering function of a semiflexible polymer is defined by @xmath99expressing @xmath100 in ( [ w17 ] ) through the tangent vectors , @xmath101 , and representing the average in ( [ w17 ] ) using the formalism of the quantum rigid rotator yields that the scattering function of the semiflexible polymer @xmath102 is the inverse laplace transform of @xmath103 multiplied with the factor @xmath60 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , the short - chain expansion of @xmath4 enables one to derive in a straightforward way the short - chain expansion of the scattering function .",
    "taking into account the first four terms in the sum over @xmath27 in ( [ w12 ] ) results in the following expression for the scattering function @xmath104where @xmath105 , and @xmath106is the scattering function of a stiff rod .",
    "the plot of the scattering function multiplied by @xmath107 for different values of @xmath79 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "for chain length @xmath108 .",
    "dots : stiff rod ; continuous : @xmath87 ; dashes : @xmath86 .",
    ", width=240 ]    the accuracy of the computations is determined by the values of @xmath105 , where curves corresponding to different @xmath79 begin to diverge .",
    "the fig.[fig1 ] shows that for @xmath108 the continuous and dashed curves begin to diverge for @xmath109 .",
    "the partition function of a semiflexible polymer with one end fixed and force @xmath110 applied to the another end @xmath111can be expressed through the distribution function of the end - to - end distance as follows @xmath112using the definition of the free energy @xmath113 the extension - force relation can be expressed through the partition function as @xmath114thus , the short - chain expansion of the extension - force relation is directly obtained from that of the fourier transform of the distribution function of the end - to - end distance ( [ gkn ] ) . taking into account the first @xmath115 terms in the series in ( [ w12 ] ) results in the following expression for the extension - force relation @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ r - f ] ) gives the extension - force relation for stiff rod .",
    "the log - log plot of @xmath118 for different @xmath79 and for stiff rod is shown in fig.[fig4 ] .    .",
    "dots : stiff rod ; continuous : @xmath115 ; dashes : @xmath119.,width=240 ]    the slope for the stiff rod is @xmath120 , while the slope for the worm - like chain approaches the value @xmath121 , which is the asymptotic result for finite worm - like chain at large forces @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows that the convergence of the short - chain expansion for the extension - force relation is worse than that of the scattering function .",
    "to conclude , using the exact computation of a large number of moments of the end - to - end distribution function @xmath0 of the worm - like chain , which are obtained from the representation of the distribution function as a matrix element of the infinite order matrix @xcite,@xcite , we have established the analytical form of the coefficients in taylor expansions of the moments for short @xmath1 .",
    "the knowledge of these coefficients enabled us to resummate the moment expansion of @xmath0 by taking into account consecutively the deviations of the moments from their stiff rod limit . within this procedure",
    "we have derived the short - chain expansion for the distribution function of the end - to - end polymer distance , the scattering function , and the extension - force relation , by taking into account the deviations of the moments from their stiff rod limit to the seventh order in @xmath1 .",
