    "the diffuse interstellar bands ( hereafter , dibs ) are a series ( @xmath2 300 ) of broad absorption lines at @xmath1 = 4000  to 1.3@xmath4 m . since the first detections @xcite , various molecules , including organic compounds ( e.g. , polycyclic organic hydrocarbons , fullerenes , carbon chains , and carbon nanotubes ) , have been proposed as the source of dibs , because they are all relatively stable within the harsh radiation environment of space .",
    "nonetheless , it has not been confirmed observationally what the _ real _ source(s ) of dibs are / is , and this remains one of the most long - standing unsolved questions in astronomy .",
    "originally , dibs were detected in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) toward galactic stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and then were also detected in the large and small magellanic clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in nearby galaxies @xcite , in starburst galaxies @xcite , and in high column density absorption systems ( i.e. , damped ly@xmath5 systems ) at redshifts up to @xmath6 @xmath2 0.5 @xcite .",
    "thus , dib absorbers are ubiquitous in space .    among @xmath2300",
    "dibs , only a few have specific source candidates : e.g. , large ionized @xmath0 fullerene ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath1 = 9577    and 9632    @xcite , several fullerenes ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) at @xmath1 = 4430  @xcite , and naphthalene cation ( @xmath12 ) at @xmath1 = 6125   , 6489   , and 6707    @xcite .",
    "these dibs have wavelengths that are very close to those measured in laboratory . by running a variety of gas - phase chemical models",
    ", @xcite confirmed that linear hydrocarbons are spontaneously converted into cyclic rings and fullerenes . among these ,",
    "the dibs at @xmath1 = 9577    and 9632    are most clearly detected , and have been discussed frequently ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , their identification is still in question , because @xcite did not report on the other weaker transitions of @xmath7 at @xmath1 = 9366    and 9419   , which should exist in conjunction with the two detected dibs , if their carrier really is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "further observations that would support this identification are required . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the ism in the orion nebula , and report on the detectability of several dibs at 9000     9700   , depending on the stellar environments .",
    "we obtained spectra of three o / b stars in or around the orion nebula on 2008 november 14 ( ut ) with the subaru telescope and high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; @xcite ) .",
    "the positions of our targets are shown in figure  1 .",
    "two stars ( hd  37022 and hd  37041 ) lie in the central region of the nebula .",
    "the other star ( hd  37150 ) is located at the edge of the nebula . because our targeted wavelength region is at @xmath2 9000    ",
    "10000   , a number of telluric lines give severe contamination .",
    "therefore , we observed a standard star ( hd  37397 ) @xmath13 350  ) and spectral type earlier than b2 @xcite , are optimal for our purpose . ] near the nebula to divide out these lines , as described in section 2.1 .",
    "stellar intrinsic features are smoothed out , because hd  37397 is a rapid rotating star with rotational velocity of @xmath14 = 355  @xcite .",
    "we used a 03 slit width ( @xmath15 ) , and adopted 2 pixel binning only along the spatial direction .",
    "the red grating , with a central wavelength of 8650   , was used to cover the wavelength of 7310    and 8560    on the blue ccd chip and 8710  and 10000  on the red ccd chip .",
    "only the red ccd data was used because the blue ccd photon counts were saturated and deviated from linearity .",
    "we reduced the data in a standard manner using the iraf software . for wavelength calibration",
    ", we used a th - ar spectrum . after removing telluric lines by dividing the object spectra by the standard star spectrum ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) , we directly fitted the continuum with a third - order cubic spline function . to increase signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ,",
    "every 0.1   - wide segments are smoothed and resampled .",
    "once we extract one - dimensional spectra of three target stars , we need to remove telluric lines by using a standard star spectrum .",
    "because dibs , whose profiles are usually very broad and shallow , are easily buried in strong telluric lines , a careful removal is necessary .",
    "first , we normalize the standard star spectrum , leaving only telluric features because rotationally broadened stellar lines are fitted out as continuum .",
    "because the object stars are observed under slightly different airmass from that of the standard star , we have to correct telluric lines according to their optical depth , as @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are raw and corrected normalized spectra of telluric lines , respectively .",
    "the sec@xmath6(obj , ss ) is the airmass toward the object or standard star . here",
    ", we assume a plane parallel atmosphere , because sec@xmath6 toward our targets ( including a standard star ) are all close to 1 ( i.e. , close to zenith ) and because object / standard stars were all observed close in time to each other .",
    "finally , we obtain telluric free spectra by dividing the spectra of object stars by the airmass - corrected telluric line spectrum .",
    "we observed only one standard star for the telluric line removal , and its spectral type is slightly different from those of the object stars .",
    "nonetheless , the photospheric features from the standard star do not affect the final object spectra significantly , because their line profiles are all broad and shallow and they should be fitted out while continuum fitting . on the other hand , any photospheric features from the object stars will still remain after dividing by the standard star spectrum .",
    "we investigate these in detail in section 4.3 .",
    "an observation log is given in table  1 , in which we list target name , coordinate ( ra and dec ) , apparent visual magnitude , spectral type , total exposure time , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio per pixel after sampling , averaged sec@xmath6 , degree of reddening , dust extinction in the visual band , effective temperature , and surface gravity .",
    "normalized spectra of our three target stars are presented in figure  2 .",
    "we show only five dib regions , which we discuss below .",
    "at first we search for the two dibs at @xmath1 @xmath2 9577    and 9632    ( i.e. , candidates for @xmath3 absorption ) in the spectra of three target stars . among these",
    ", detections have been reported only toward hd  37022 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use all absorption features that are detected with @xmath19 5@xmath20 level .",
    "both dibs are detected toward the two stars within the nebula , while no features are detected toward hd  37150 , with an equivalent width detection limit of ew = 7.0  m  and 5.5  m  for dib  9577 and 9632 , respectively .",
    "based on laboratory measurements , @xcite present wavelengths of 13 vibrational - mode absorption lines of @xmath3 ( in neon matrix ) at 8323    ",
    "9642    ( in air ) , of which 7 are covered by our subaru spectra .",
    "our identification results for the three target spectra are summarized in table  2 . following column ( 1 ) with i",
    "d name , columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give vacuum wavenumbers and air wavelengths of expected @xmath3 features , columns ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) are flux - weighted central wavelengths , ew , wavelength shift from the laboratory measurement , and full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of dibs toward hd  37022 .",
    "columns ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) are identical to ( 4 )  ( 7 ) but toward hd  37041 , column ( 12 ) shows the 5@xmath20 detection limit of dibs toward hd  37150 . we did not correct for contamination from the stellar lines when we measure equivalent widths of dib  9632 , because their equivalent widths are no more than 50  m  for spectral types of o7 ",
    "b3i ( @xcite ; see further discussion in section 4.3 ) .",
    "all of our targets and the standard star lie in this category .",
    "interestingly , three dibs are newly identified as possible @xmath3 lines , and detected only toward stars in the nebula .",
    "the equivalent width and the fwhm of each dib are measured and presented in table  2 , although the latter has much uncertainty .",
    "because of the presence of substructure ( see section 4.2 ) in the dib and the contamination with strong telluric lines , it is not straightforward to measure widths . in figure  2",
    ", we shaded the wavelength regions around the five dibs , over which we carried out the measurements .",
    "all target stars are affected by both the interstellar and the local extinction .",
    "the degree of reddening , @xmath21 , listed in table  1 is the difference between the observed @xmath22 color and the expected @xmath22 color , where the expected color is estimated from the predictions of @xcite by using the effective temperature and surface gravity measurements from @xcite .",
    "we also list extinction values from @xcite .",
    "the reddening is significant toward hd  37022 in trapezium , and also toward hd  37041 , which has only a small offset of @xmath22.4@xmath23 ( @xmath20.3  pc ) from hd  37022 .",
    "both stars lie in highly ionized central region of the orion nebula . on the other hand , hd  37150",
    ", whose distance from trapezium is @xmath220@xmath23 ( @xmath22.5  pc ) , has small reddening .",
    "thus , our target selection enables us to trace two regions of the orion nebula with very different physical conditions .",
    "we can draw several inferences on the dib carriers in the orion nebula from our observations ; physical condition with regard to their internal structure , and correlation with dust abundance .",
    "we have also found additional candidates of @xmath3 dibs .",
    "we discuss all these below .",
    "our targets are distributed at the center or the edge of the orion nebula , which enables us to compare the detectability of @xmath3 dibs in two extreme physical conditions .",
    "the regions toward hd  37022 and hd  37041 are strongly uv - irradiated by the hot trapezium stars , while the ionization condition toward hd  37150 is probably much lower .",
    "visual extinction is also very different  the former two are severely , and the latter is only slightly , reddened .",
    "dibs are known to have a strong correlation with neutral hydrogen column density ( i.e. , gas abundance ; @xcite ) as well as dust extinction ( i.e. , dust abundance ; @xcite ) . local uv radiation may enhance the 9577/9632 dibs @xcite .",
    "we detect these dibs only toward two stars at the strongly uv - irradiated regions with much amount of dust , which is consistent with past results .",
    "this trend can be explained by a `` skin effect ''  the effective shielding of uv radiation by the inner layers of dust in the nebula , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also measured the complete dib spectrum of hd  37022 , and discovered that almost all optical dibs ( except for dibs at @xmath1 = 5780    and 6284   , as shown in @xcite ) were very weak or not detected toward this extremely high uv - irradiated region .",
    "it is likely that the carriers of these dibs are dissociated under such high ionizing radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "5780/6284 dibs as well as 9577/9632 dibs show a clear correlation of their absorption strengths with their local ionization levels , which means these carriers prefer an ionized phase ( i.e. , @xmath3 with ionization potential ( ip ) = 11.3  ev for the 9577/9632 dibs ) to a neutral phase ( i.e. , @xmath0 with ip = 7.6  ev ) @xcite .",
    "thus , we confirm the 9577/9632    dib carriers have small - scale ( i.e. , on a few parsec scale ) spatial fluctuation in a single cloud ( i.e. , the orion nebula ) , while @xcite , already noted a galactic scale fluctuation .",
    "we reconfirm that the detection of the 9577/9632 dib require large amount of dust as well as strong uv radiation .",
    "the 9577/9632 dibs were previously treated as a single gaussian profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) and their equivalent widths are also measured using this assumption ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the dibs toward the orion nebula clearly show asymmetrical profiles with possible multiple components in our high resolution spectra .",
    "actually , this asymmetrical profile can be seen in the past papers , especially for dib  9632 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although it was not discussed in detail .",
    "@xcite resolved three optical dibs at 5797 , 6379 , and 6613    into two or three subcomponents , following the first discovery of substructure by @xcite .",
    "they conclude that rotational contours probably play a major role in this internal structure , following @xcite , although there could be small contributions from other sources ( e.g. , instrumental line spread , thermal broadening , gas turbulence , and intramolecular vibration rotation energy transfer ) .    here",
    ", we would like to suggest an additional contributor to the broadening that we observe ; i.e. , the existence of discrete absorbers along our sight lines .",
    "@xcite took high resolution spectra of four trapezium stars ( including hd  37022 and hd  37041 ) , and discovered internal substructures with multiple absorption components in and absorption profiles .",
    "the typical velocity distributions of these lines are @xmath23050  and up to 60  , which is one third of the fwhm ( @xmath2130  ) of the 9577/9632 dibs we observed .",
    "if each velocity component seen in and gives rise to the dib profiles , these would result in a substantial contribution to the dib broadening .",
    "we performed a simple test for this scenario as follows .",
    "@xcite measured the fwhm of the 9577/9632  dibs toward three stars ( including one of our targets , hd  37022 ) , and obtained a slightly larger line width toward hd  37022 ( fwhm @xmath24   ) as compared to the line widths toward two other stars ( fwhm @xmath22.9   ) .",
    "this difference can be reproduced by adding an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath280  to a dib cloud toward hd  37022 , which is possible because multiple and clouds are distributed within a similar velocity width , @xmath2460  , as described above .",
    "our results suggest that several discrete dib clouds contribute non - negligibly to the total dib line width .",
    "however , it should be noted that the major source of dib broadening is likely to be intrinsic to the molecular structure of the carriers , because ( i ) such an internal structure is seen even if corresponding atomic lines have single gaussian profiles at the same velocity ( e.g. , figure  1 of @xcite ) , and because ( ii ) dibs have similar characteristic profiles toward various sightlines ( e.g. , figure  2 of @xcite ) . both of these support the idea that the main source of dib broadening is molecular in origin .    for further investigation of the internal structure of the 9577/9632 dibs , high quality spectra with higher s / n ratio would be required .      although @xcite detected two dibs within 10    of the laboratory - measured positions of two @xmath3 absorption features @xcite , this identification was questioned by @xcite because two other @xmath3 absorption lines at 9366    and 9419    are not detected simultaneously .",
    "thus , this identification is not yet a matter of consensus .",
    "additional evidence is required for further discussion . using our subaru spectra with relatively wide wavelength coverage from 8700    to 1  @xmath25",
    ", we attempt to confirm the existence of 7 of 9 @xmath3 lines ( in addition to the 9577/9632 dibs ) from @xcite . unfortunately , the 9372/9429    lines in question ( at @xmath1 @xmath2 9366 and 9419   , according to @xcite ) are on an echelle order gap or wavelength region that is hopelessly affected by telluric lines . among the other 5 lines , three at @xmath1 @xmath2 9258 , 9210 , and 9017    are clearly detected with @xmath24 10    difference from the laboratory measurements , but one at @xmath1 @xmath2 9154    is not seen with @xmath19 5@xmath20 level toward hd  37022 and hd  37041 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we can not search for a line at @xmath1 @xmath2 8954    because it is on an echelle order gap .",
    "no lines are detected toward hd  37150 .    in order to rule out the possibility that these five dibs arise in the stellar photosphere , we synthesized stellar spectra using model atmospheres with the atlas9 and synthe codes @xcite .",
    "we used model parameters such as stellar rotational velocity , effective temperature , and surface gravity that are appropriate to each star ( as listed in table  1 ) from the literature @xcite .",
    "the model spectra are overlaid on the observed spectra and the most prominent absorption features are named in figure  2 .",
    "below , we discuss each dib .",
    "dib  9633 .",
    " : :    this is one of the two dibs that have been proposed to be associated    with @xmath3 .",
    "although it is partially blending with    line from stellar photosphere , the line center is clearly shifted    blueward from the center of the dib .",
    "moreover , the line is weak    compared to the dib .",
    "this is the case especially for type  o stars .",
    "this was one of the first dibs discovered in the near - infrared .",
    "dib  9577 .",
    " : :    another dib whose origin was suggested to be @xmath3 .",
    "there are no narrow stellar intrinsic lines within 10    of the dib ,    although the dib is positioned at the red wing of a very broad line at    @xmath1 = 9546.0   .",
    "the detection of this dib is highly    secure .",
    "dib  9258 .",
    " : :    we have discovered this dib , and discuss it here for the first time .    although it is located at the edge of an echelle order ,",
    "the detection    itself is secure because line features toward two different stars    ( i.e. , hd  37022 and hd  37041 ) are almost identical .",
    "their origin is    neither stellar photospheric , nor due to any instrumental data defect .",
    "the feature is only seen toward the trapezium stars , as noted for the    two dibs mentioned above . an absorption feature at    @xmath26 = @xmath25  10    toward    hd  37150 is probably caused by the line complex within the stellar    photosphere , which is more prominent for type  b stars than type  o    stars ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "a mild inclination of the model continua is due    to a strong line at @xmath1 = 9244.4   .",
    "dib  9210 .",
    " : :    only this dib was significantly blending with stellar intrinsic    features of at @xmath1 = 9210.3  and 9213.2    and at    @xmath1 = 9218.3   .",
    "however , the flux - weighted centers    are shifted slightly redward from the line center of this dib .",
    "the    whole range of the observed feature can not be reproduced only by the    stellar photospheric lines , and much of the absorption must originate    in a dib .",
    "the equivalent width and line width of this dib listed in    table  2 are only upper limits .",
    "the inclined continuum of the model    spectra is due to a strong line at @xmath1 = 9229.0   .",
    "dib  9017 .",
    " : :    this is the weakest one among the five dibs we detected in our    spectra .",
    "the dib is detected only toward the trapezium stars like the    other dibs , which also supports this discovery .",
    "a strong line is    located at @xmath1 = 9014.9    near the dib , but it    should not affect the dib because of its broad and smooth line profile    ( i.e. , it will be fitted out during spectrum normalization ) .",
    "interestingly , all detected dibs are blue - shifted from the laboratory measurements by 48    ( @xmath27 @xmath2 150200  ) ; this is the same trend as seen in the 9577/9632 dibs .",
    "this blue - shift is not due to any outflow of dib carriers from the orion nebula , because the corresponding and absorption lines are blue - shifted only up to @xmath28 @xmath29 20  in heliocentric velocity , about one order of magnitude smaller than the dib velocity shift @xcite .",
    "we suspect this is a systematic trend due to differences in physical conditions between the gas - phase inter stellar medium and the laboratory neon matrix measurement , as found for other molecules like naphthalene ( c@xmath30h@xmath31@xmath32 ; @xcite ) , coronene and ovalene ( c@xmath33h@xmath34 and c@xmath35h@xmath36 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this wavelength shift is also estimated to be smaller in the near - infrared band at @xmath1 @xmath2 1  @xmath4 m ( @xmath37 @xmath2 5  10  , which is almost same value as our results in table  2 ) than that in the optical band ( @xmath2 20  50  ; @xcite ) . the measurement in matrix would also change the relative strengths of absorption lines @xcite .",
    "this may explain our result that the @xmath3 lines at @xmath1 @xmath2 9528 , 9210 , and 9012   , whose strengths are very weak ( by a factor of @xmath2 10 compared to the stronger 9577/9632 lines ) in the laboratory measurements",
    "@xcite , are detected with almost same equivalent widths as those of the 9577/9633 dibs in our spectra .",
    "if these dibs are really arising from the same molecule , their line widths also would be expected to be similar @xcite .",
    "the fwhms of the three newly detected dibs at @xmath1 @xmath2 9258 , 9210 , and 9017    are @xmath193   , @xmath26.5   , and @xmath22.5   , respectively , which are scattered around those of the 9577/9632 dibs , @xmath24.5  ",
    ". this could be due to contamination of other atomic lines ( for dib  9210 ) or a failure in detecting weak profile wings ( for dib  9017 ) .",
    "more precise measurements for @xmath3 in laboratory without using neon / argon matrix are desirable .      from their dib survey , targeting the milky way , the lmc , and the smc ,",
    "@xcite have found a clear correlation between the strength of dibs and the column density along the line of sight . following this result , @xcite embarked on a survey of the 5780 dib in damped ly@xmath5 ( dla ) systems ( with @xmath38 ( ) of @xmath19 20.3 [ ] ) at cosmological distances , and discovered one system with two dibs at @xmath39 of 5705    and 5780  with moderate reddening dla system ( e(b@xmath40v ) = 0.23 ) at @xmath6 = 0.5 @xcite .",
    "so far , this is the highest redshift at which dibs have been detected .",
    "this detection would imply that dib carriers are distributed universally , and their abundance probably has a strong correlation with dust as well as gas abundance .",
    "similar correlations have also been noted for the 9577/9632 dibs @xcite , and our results are consistent with these ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "although our measured 9577  dib strengths lie slightly above from the expected value , this may be because the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath41 = @xmath42 , is larger toward stars in the orion nebula , as shown in table  1",
    ".    the equivalent width ratio of these dibs should remain unchanged by the absorber s physical conditions if they all have the same carrier @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the relative strength of the 9577/9632 dibs to be @xmath2 1.5 in a neon matrix , but with an uncertainty over the range of 1.5 to 2.0 , depending on production conditions .",
    "on the other hand , this ratio is close to 1 in our observation toward two stars in the orion nebula ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this is instead consistent with other measurements . @xcite and @xcite also found the ratio of close to 1 .",
    "if it can be confirmed that the gas phase measurement gives a smaller intensity ratio of close to unity in the laboratory , the identification of these dibs with @xmath3 would be strengthened .",
    "we have investigated the detectability of the 9577/9632 dibs that are candidates of @xmath3 absorption features .",
    "we obtained spectra of two stars in the orion nebula and one star at the edge of the nebula .",
    "these dibs are detected only toward the two stars in the nebula .",
    "furthermore , for the first time , we have detected three other dibs that could also arise in @xmath3 .",
    "the wavelengths of these features matches the laboratory values to within 10   . with our high - resolution spectra ( @xmath43 = 120,000 )",
    ", we found internal structures in the dibs with two or three components .",
    "if our sight - lines really trace multiple clouds , those could partially contribute to the line broadening of the dibs , though the main cause is likely to be relate to molecular transitions . the dib strength and dust reddening from our data are consistent with correlations seen by previous studies , which means that we are probably observing the same dib carrier . for further investigation ,",
    "we need ( i ) spectra with higher s / n ratio , ( ii ) precise measurements of @xmath3 in the laboratory without using matrix , and ( iii ) spectra taken from the space ( e.g. , using hubble space telescope ) to detect the dibs without any contamination from the telluric lines .",

    "<S> large organic molecules and carbon clusters are basic building blocks of life , but their existence in the universe has not been confirmed beyond doubt . a number of unidentified absorption features ( arising in the diffuse inter - stellar medium ) , usually called `` diffuse inter - stellar bands ( dibs ) '' , </S>",
    "<S> are hypothesized to be produced by large molecules . among these , buckminsterfullerene @xmath0 has gained much attention as a candidate for dib absorbers because of its high stability in space . </S>",

    "<S> however , it is still not clear how their existence depends on their environment . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained high - resolution spectra of three stars in / around the orion nebula , to search for any correlations of the dib strength with carrier s physical conditions , such as dust - abundance and uv radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> we find three dibs at @xmath1 @xmath2 9017   , 9210   , and 9258    as additional @xmath3 feature candidates , which could support this identification . </S>",
    "<S> these dibs have asymmetric profiles similar to the longer wavelength features . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the relative strengths of dibs are close to unity and differ from laboratory measurements , a similar trend as noticed for the 9577/9632 dibs . </S>"
