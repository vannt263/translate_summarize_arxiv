    "one of the great scientific expectations when the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) was launched in 1995 was the discovery of coherent pulsations from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . at present , only five accreting millisecond pulsars in lmxbs are known .",
    "all five are faint transient sources for which the pulsations at the spin period of the pulsar were discovered during outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , no pulsations have ever been seen in the non - transient x - ray emission from any lmxb .",
    "one possibility is that msp coherent pulsations are smeared out by rapidly changing orbital doppler shifts in short period binaries .",
    "modern accelerated signal search techniques have not been applied systematically to many lmxbs so it is possible that there are millisecond pulsations in them that have gone unnoticed .",
    "there are many things that we can learn from searching for more examples of direct pulsations from lmxbs .",
    "coherent pulsations give the precise rotation rate of the neutron star and test the connection between recycled msps and lmxbs .",
    "they help constrain the models of khz qpos and burst oscillations .",
    "timing of the coherent pulses would also allow measurements of the accretion torques , the orbital parameters , and potentially the companion masses .",
    "in addition , in combination with x - ray and optical spectra , pulse timing can give information about the compactness and the equation of state of the neutron star .",
    "finally , setting stringent upper limits on coherent pulsations in several sources in a variety of spectral states will impose constraints on the possible mechanism for suppression of the predicted coherent pulsations mentioned above .",
    "for these reasons , we have started a large - scale archival _ rxte _",
    "search for coherent pulsations from lmxbs , the first target of which is the ultracompact globular cluster lmxb 4u  1820@xmath030 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : characteristics ] , we describe the general properties of 4u  1820@xmath030 . in section  [ sec : observations ] , we describe the observations as well as the procedure we used to search for coherent pulsations . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we describe our search techniques and the methods used to investigate the obtained candidate pulsation frequencies . in section  [ sec : results ] , we describe our results and derive our upper limits on possible coherent pulsations .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : sum ] , we discuss the implications of our findings and summarize .      the source 4u  1820@xmath030 is an atoll lmxb in globular cluster ngc 6624 @xcite .",
    "it has an orbital binary period of 685  s ( 11.4  min ) .",
    "the orbital period was identified to be the period of a nearly sinusoidal x - ray luminosity modulation with an amplitude of 2% to 3% and no strong energy dependence @xcite .",
    "a 16% modulation at a period of 687@xmath62.4  s was also seen in the uv  band @xcite .",
    "this is the shortest known binary orbital period in an lmxb .",
    "4u  1820@xmath030 undergoes a regular @xmath7176  day accretion cycle @xcite switching between high and low luminosity states , which differ by a factor of @xmath73 in their luminosity @xcite .",
    "this luminosity variation makes 4u  1820@xmath030 an attractive target for our search because it allows us to sample a fairly large range of accretion rates in case the pulsations become visible only in some . in the low luminosity state ,",
    "regular type  i bursts are seen @xmath623 days around the minimum luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is notable that burst oscillations have not been observed from this source . in the low state ,",
    "4u  1820@xmath030 has also shown an extremely energetic superburst @xcite .",
    "this bursting behaviour confirms that the observed luminosity variations actually correspond to changes in the local accretion rate at the surface , and not just a geometrical effect , since they affect the bursting properties of the source .",
    "4u  1820@xmath030 also exhibits a variety of spectral states as can be seen from figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "several low frequency qpos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as well as two peaks of khz  qpos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have been observed from this source .",
    "the separation between the two peaks is 275@xmath68  hz @xcite . if the secondary star in the system is a white dwarf , its mass is estimated to be 0.058 to 0.078  _",
    "@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "if the secondary is a main sequence star , the upper limit on its mass is 0.3  _",
    "@xmath3  @xcite .    of all known lmxbs",
    ", we searched 4u  1820@xmath030 first for several reasons .",
    "first , many high - time - resolution , long data sets are available in the archives .",
    "second , the presence of khz qpos in this source may indicate favorable conditions for detecting pulsations .",
    "third , its extremely short orbital period allows the use of the phase modulation search technique .",
    "this technique is most sensitive and provides the biggest increase in sensitivity over previous methods when the observations are longer than two complete binary orbits @xcite .",
    "the precisely known and short orbital period also makes 4u  1820@xmath030 one of only two lmxbs that can be searched using our fully coherent orbital - parameter - fitting search technique on a reasonable time scale .",
    "the source 4u  1820@xmath030 has previously been searched for coherent pulsations at frequencies under 50  hz by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "their upper limit on the pulsed fraction for sinusoidal pulses was 0.6% ( 95% confidence level ) , and 1.1% ( 99% confidence level ) respectively .",
    "our searches cover a much wider frequency range , including , for the first time , the khz range .",
    "this is particularly important since likely spin frequencies are near 275  hz or 550  hz , based on the khz  qpos @xcite .",
    "we searched 34 archival _ rxte _",
    "pca observations collected between 1996 and 2002 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "all the observations were available in event modes with time resolutions of @xmath7125  @xmath8s .",
    "32 of the observations had a total time on source @xmath9  10  ks .",
    "the longest of these was 29  ks with a total time on source of 16  ks .",
    "some of the observations were segments of longer ones which allowed us to concatenate and analyse them together .",
    "the longest of the concatenated observations was 77.5  ks with a total time on source of 46.5  ks .    for each observation , we downloaded the files of raw events ( one file for each _ rxte _ orbit )",
    ". the duration of an _ rxte _ orbit ( including earth occultation time ) is @xmath75.7  ks .",
    "we filtered the files by selecting only events where the source elevation was @xmath9  10@xmath10 , the pointing offset was @xmath11  0.02@xmath10 , and where a minimum number of operational pcus were on ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we then transformed the arrival times of the events to the solar system barycenter using the ` ftool ' ` faxbary ` .",
    "the barycentering was necessary to remove the effects of the spacecraft and earth motions .",
    "we then split the data into four energy bands : soft ( 2 - 5 kev ) , medium ( 5 - 10 kev ) , hard ( 10 - 20 kev ) , and wide ( 2 - 20 kev ) , in order to attempt to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the unknown pulsations . this processing used custom python scripts to call the standard ` ftools ' . at the end of the preliminary data preparation we obtained four lists of events ( photon arrival times ) for every _",
    "rxte _ orbit in every observation , each list corresponding to one of the four energy bands .",
    "after we prepared the _ rxte_-orbit - long lists of events , we concatenated them into observation - long lists of events , and also broke them into much shorter lists of events .",
    "we then binned the events into time series of different time resolutions ( see table  [ table2 ] ) and searched them for pulsations using three types of searches which we summarize in sections   [ sec : tech1 ] , [ sec : tech2 ] , and [ sec : tech3 ] . in sections   [ sec :",
    "cand1 ] , [ sec : cand2 ] , and [ sec : cand3 ] , we explain how we used the three searches to obtain candidate pulsation frequencies . finally , in sections  [ sec : fin1 ] , [ sec : fin2 ] , and [ sec : fin3 ] , we explain the methods we used to investigate the obtained lists of candidate pulsation frequencies .",
    "all the data sets were processed on the 52-node dual 1.4  ghz athlon - based beowulf cluster operated by the mcgill university pulsar group .",
    "this is the method traditionally used to compensate for the effects of orbital motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a time series is stretched or compressed appropriately to account for a trial",
    "_ constant _ frequency derivative ( i.e.@xmath12_constant _ acceleration ) , fourier transformed , and then searched for pulsations .",
    "we used a fourier - domain variant of this technique based on matched filtering techniques which includes fourier interpolation and harmonic summing of 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 harmonics to improve the sensitivity to non - sinusoidal pulsations @xcite .",
    "acceleration searches work best for systems where the orbital period  @xmath13  10@xmath14the observation length .",
    "acceleration searches are not optimal for systems like 4u  1820@xmath030 where the orbital period is shorter than the observation duration : the acceleration is not constant over the length of our time series .",
    "however , we chose not to run searches on time series shorter than 600  s ( see table  [ table2 ] ) because we required a large number of photons .",
    "so while we did not expect acceleration searches to find pulsations , we still used them because they are included in our standard search pipeline .",
    "also , the segmented acceleration searches that we ran , even though they were not short enough for the acceleration to be constant , can still be useful if a strong pulsed signal appears for a short period of time perhaps because the ` weather ' on the surface briefly cleared and the pulsations appeared .      to run acceleration searches , we first binned the lists of events which we obtained in the data preparation into time series of different lengths and time resolutions ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "we performed an fft on each of the time series and fed the result into a local red noise reduction algorithm which divides the fft into continuous intervals the size of which increases logarithmically with frequency .",
    "the power in every bin of every interval is divided by the mean power in that interval .",
    "this produces ffts that have a reduced signature of red noise .",
    "we then ran the acceleration searches on the obtained ffts , searching for a maximum constant acceleration of @xmath15",
    "m / s@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the detected pulsations in hz , and @xmath18 is the integration time in seconds . for a signal of period 3  ms and an integration time of 600  s ,",
    "this acceleration is 425  m / s@xmath16 .",
    "this number was chosen because it corresponds to the maximum length of a trial fourier response template used in the search that would fit in the cache memory of the available machines .",
    "the maximum possible line of sight acceleration of 4u  1820@xmath030 is @xmath19  m / s@xmath16 where @xmath20 is the projected semi - major axis of the binary in light - seconds . for a companion mass of 0.05  _ @xmath3@xmath21 and an inclination angle of 60@xmath10 , @xmath20  =  13.4  lt - ms , and @xmath22  =  339  m / s@xmath16 .",
    "using acceleration searches , we searched for signals with an equivalent gaussian significance @xmath23 @xcite and with frequencies between 0.0375  hz and 2048  hz . we estimated @xmath24 based on the probability distribution of sums of powers in a normalized power spectrum @xcite . in order to correctly determine the significance of a candidate",
    ", we also took into account the number of independent trials in the searches @xcite .",
    "sometimes we increased the lower limit on the searched frequency to 1/8  hz in order to eliminate the large number of low - frequency candidate oscillations that the red noise reduction routine did not successfully eliminate .",
    "when our acceleration searches detect a candidate oscillation , they return values for the frequency of the signal @xmath17 , the frequency derivative @xmath25 , and the significance of the detection @xmath24 . using the returned values for @xmath17 and @xmath25 , we folded all acceleration candidates with @xmath26 .",
    "our folding software had the ability to fine tune the search in the @xmath17 and @xmath25 directions .",
    "we also folded all the candidates with @xmath23 that appeared in 15 or more observations to within 0.1% of their frequency .",
    "0.1% was chosen because the frequency modulation caused by the the orbit of 4u  1820@xmath030 will not cause @xmath17 to deviate by more than 0.1% ( see section  [ sec : tech2 ] ) .",
    "all the folded candidates showed noise - like profiles .        in order to analyze longer observations we used the new ` phase - modulation ' or ` sideband ' search technique described by @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "this technique relies on the fact that if the observation time is longer than the orbital period ( @xmath27 ) , the orbit phase - modulates the pulsar s spin frequency , resulting in a family of evenly spaced sidebands in the frequency domain , centered around the intrinsic pulsar signal for circular orbits ( see for example figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the width of the region occupied by the sidebands is @xmath28 fourier bins , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the signal and @xmath20 is the projected semi - major axis .",
    "the constant spacing between the sidebands is @xmath29 fourier bins .",
    "a phase modulation search is conducted by taking short ffts of portions of the full power spectrum of an observation .",
    "the short ffts cover overlapping portions of various lengths ( to account for the unknown semi - major axis of the lmxb ) over all the fourier frequency range of the original power spectrum ( to account for the unknown pulsation period ) .",
    "the secondary power spectra are then searched for harmonically related peaks indicating regularly spaced sidebands ( to detect the orbital period of the lmxb ) .",
    "our phase modulation search included fourier interpolation and harmonic summing of up to 4 harmonics of the orbital periods .",
    "this particular harmonic summing accounts for non - circular orbits , but not for non - sinusoidal pulsations .",
    "a detection provides initial estimates of the lmxb spin period , the orbital period , and the projected radius of the orbit . for interesting candidate oscillations , these estimates",
    "are then refined by generating a series of complex - valued template responses ( i.e. matched filters for the fourier domain response of an orbitally modulated signal ) to correlate with the original fourier amplitudes @xcite .",
    "to run the phase modulation searches , we first concatenated the orbit - long lists of events which we had obtained at the end of the preliminary data preparation into observation - long lists of events .",
    "we then binned both the the observation - long and the orbit - long lists into time series ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "we performed an fft on each , and fed the results into the local red noise reduction routine .",
    "we ran the phase modulation searches on the original ffts as well as on the red noise - reduced ffts .",
    "the obtained lists of candidate oscillations were almost identical : most of the candidates were millisecond pulsations so the red noise reduction did not affect them .    in order for the phase modulation search to detect a phase modulated signal , the short ffts described in section  [ sec : tech2 ] must overlap at least a part of the phase modulated signal .",
    "when running the phase modulation searches on the observation - long data sets , we used the range of short fft lengths derived in @xcite that was appropriate for a wide range of orbital parameters : from 64 to 131072 bins . as we explained in section  [ sec : tech2 ] , the spread of the phase modulated signal in the fourier domain is proportional to @xmath30 where @xmath20 is the projected semi - major axis in light - seconds and @xmath17 is the intrinsic frequency of the signal . because the maximum @xmath20 for 4u  1820@xmath030 is small ( for the upper - limit companion mass of 0.3  _ @xmath3@xmath21 and an inclination angle of 90@xmath10 , @xmath31  lt - s ) , the sizes of the short ffts that we used would allow us to detect signals up to our nyquist frequency ( 2048  hz ) .",
    "we used a smaller range of short fft sizes when we ran the phase - modulation search on the orbit - long data sets ( 64 to 32768 bins ) , and therefore were most sensitive to signal frequencies @xmath1  1  khz for all possible values of the companion mass .      for every candidate oscillation it finds , our phase modulation search returns , along with other information , a pulsation period , an orbital period , and @xmath24 .",
    "we know from simulation that when a phase modulation search detects a signal with pulsed fraction equal to or greater than our upper limit calculated in section  [ sec : sensitivitypm ] , the pulsation period of the signal appears many times in the list of candidates obtained for that data set due to overlapping numerous short ffts .",
    "depending on the strength of the signal , there can also be a jump in the significance ( measured in @xmath24 ) between the candidate oscillation corresponding to the real signal and the candidate with the next smaller significance .",
    "when this happens , if the list of candidates is arranged in order of decreasing @xmath24 , the real signal appears at the beginning of the list as an outlier with a singularly large @xmath24 .    when examining the phase modulation search candidates , we first extracted the candidates whose orbital period was 685  s within uncertainties . among the extracted candidates , we searched for oscillation periods that appeared several times in any given observation .",
    "there were none . also among the extracted candidates , we searched for candidates whose pulsation period appeared in the candidate lists of more than 10 observations to within a fractional period of 0.1% .",
    "there were also none .",
    "the 0.1% was a generous percentage considering that the uncertainties in the candidate pulsation periods were much smaller .",
    "finally , we searched for outliers within the candidate lists .",
    "we did not find any .        in this search",
    ", the source s motion is modelled as a circular orbit .",
    "this is because lmxb accreting systems are known to have nearly circular orbits  @xcite .",
    "hence , we ignored the small errors due to a non - zero eccentricity .",
    "three parameters are required to specify a particular circular orbit model : the orbital period @xmath32 , the projected semi ",
    "major axis in light - seconds @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the real semi - major axis , @xmath35 is the inclination of the orbit , and @xmath36 is the speed of light ) , and the orbital phase at the start of an observation @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the start time of the observation , and @xmath39 is the time of the last ascending node before @xmath38 ) .",
    "once a set of trial orbital parameters is specified , it is straightforward to remove the shifts that the orbit would introduce in the arrival time of every photon . if the set of trial orbital parameters matches the real orbital parameters of the source , the resulting time series will contain the signature of an isolated pulsar that can be found using a standard pulsation search with no acceleration .    for 4u  1820@xmath030 , the orbital period is accurately known , but the other two parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath40 , must be searched . in @xcite , a maximum likely value @xmath41 for @xmath20 is estimated , but the orbital phase is completely unknown .",
    "the sensitivity of detection to errors in the orbital parameters increases with pulsation frequency ( see section  [ sec : sensitivityfs ] ) , so one must also estimate the highest likely pulsation frequency @xmath42 . from the sensitivity calculations in section  [ sec : sensitivityfs ] we know that the number of sets of trial orbital parameters increases as @xmath43 . for 4u  1820@xmath030 ,",
    "reasonable estimates of these numbers can be provided ( see next section ) , and the effort required to search the data is feasible .",
    "the method used to run searches by orbital - parameter - fitting is essentially the same as the standard method for running acceleration searches : the arrival times of the photons were time - shifted ( this time to account for a _ variable",
    "_ orbital acceleration ) , and the resulting data sets were searched for isolated pulsar signatures .",
    "in particular , no matched filtering in the fourier domain was done .",
    "the current implementation requires about @xmath44  hr to search a typical 4u  1820@xmath030 observation on our computers .",
    "this is why it was necessary to limit the number of observations on which to run the search .",
    "@xcite did a folded period searching of the combined 1996 - 1997 _ rxte _",
    "standard2 observations of 4u  1820@xmath030 .",
    "they obtained an orbital period of @xmath45  =  685.0144  @xmath6  0.0054  s. they then did a phase analysis combining the _ rxte _ 1996 - 1997 observations of 4u  1820@xmath030 with pre-_xte _ data and found an orbital period of @xmath32=685.0119  @xmath6  0.0001  s. the uncertainties in both figures are small enough ( see section [ sec : sensitivityfs ] ) that we did not need to search over this parameter .",
    "the decay in @xmath32 due to emission of gravitational radiation , estimated to be @xmath7  0.00018  s  yr@xmath46 @xcite , fell within the above uncertainties .",
    "we used @xmath47  s when we ran our orbital - parameter - fitting search on 4u  1820@xmath030 .",
    "the maximum plausible @xmath20 , assuming the companion is a degenerate star is @xmath48  lt - s ( this corresponds to a companion mass of 0.078_@xmath3@xmath21 for an edge - on inclination ) . with our orbital - parameter - fitting search , we searched up to an @xmath41 of 0.032  lt - s ( corresponding to a companion mass of 0.106_@xmath3@xmath21 for an edge - on inclination .",
    "larger companion masses are allowed for smaller inclinations ) .",
    "we also set an upper bound on searched pulsation frequency of @xmath491250  hz to save computer time .",
    "if a set of trial orbital parameters corresponds exactly to the real orbital parameters of 4u  1820@xmath030 , our orbital - parameter - fitting search collects successfully all the power due to the signal . if our trial orbital parameters are slightly off , there will be a sensitivity loss .",
    "when we ran the search , we tuned the parameter steps to accept up to 50% loss in signal power at the maximum frequency .",
    "( as frequency decreases or the error in the size of the orbit decreases , this loss decreases to very near zero ; see section  [ sec : sensitivityfs ] ) .",
    "based on calculations by in @xcite , and using the above known properties of 4u  1820@xmath030 and the above mentioned maximum loss in signal power , we calculated that the error in a trial @xmath20 should be no more than 0.000143  lt - s ( see section [ sec : sensitivityfs ] for details ) . with that in mind",
    ", we generated an optimal grid of trial orbital parameter sets .",
    "the grid contained several thousands of points ( see section  [ sec : sensitivityfs ] )    for each set of trial orbital parameters , we ran a separate search .",
    "we time - shifted the event data , to reflect the trial orbital parameters .",
    "we then binned it at a resolution of @xmath50  ms and computed its fourier transform .",
    "we applied our local red - noise reduction code and fed the result to our standard acceleration search code with a maximum acceleration of zero and an increased significance threshold ( i.e.  @xmath26 ) ; keeping in mind that the @xmath24 returned by the acceleration search after subtracting the time - shifts is an overestimate of the real @xmath24 of the signal .",
    "this is because the orbital - parameter - fitting coherent search fails to take into account the number of times accelerations searches were run .",
    "the resulting list of candidate oscillations was then stored and the process was repeated for the next set of trial orbital parameters .",
    "each candidate returned by the orbital - parameter - fitting code included a pulsation frequency @xmath17 , an orbital amplitude @xmath20 , an orbital phase @xmath40 , and a significance @xmath24 . using the returned values for @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and @xmath40 , we folded all the candidates with @xmath51 , allowing the folding program to search a small distance in the frequency space .",
    "most of the folded candidates showed noise - like profiles .",
    "none of the candidates corresponding to the more promising - looking folds appeared in more that one observation except for one candidate .",
    "this candidate appeared in two observations .",
    "however , the fold of the second detection of this candidate showed a noise - like profile .",
    "since folding the statistically significant candidates did not return any interesting results , we looked for candidates that repeated in more than one observation ( to within a fractional range of @xmath52  =  0.001% and to within a difference in @xmath20 of @xmath53  lt - s ) . @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath54 were derived taking into account the spacing between the trial values of @xmath20 and the drop in the amplitude of the detected signal when the trial orbital parameters were slightly off .",
    "there were about 300 candidates that repeated in 2 observations , and 0 candidates that repeated in more than 2 observations .",
    "we grouped the 300 candidates into pairs . assuming the orbital period of @xmath55  s reported in @xcite",
    ", we checked if the orbits of the members of each pair were in phase with each other . in 18 of the pairs",
    "the two orbits were in phase . in all 18 cases",
    "the single trial significances of the members of the pairs were around 3@xmath56 .",
    "again , the folds of all 36 candidates showed noise - like profiles .",
    "our searches did not detect pulsations .    since we ran the acceleration searches in a region where they are not optimized , they were much less sensitive than the other two searches that we used .",
    "below we explain the procedure we used to set an upper limit on the pulsed fraction of pulsations from 4u  1820@xmath030 detectable with our phase modulation search technique and our orbital - parameter - fitting coherent search technique .",
    "the phase modulation searches that we ran on observation - long data sets were more sensitive than the searches that we ran on the orbit - long data sets @xcite . in this section",
    "we present the procedure used to set an upper limit on the pulsed fraction using the more sensitive search .",
    "first , to save computer time , we wrote a modified version of our search script that searched only a particular region of the fft .",
    "we then ran this version of the search on several data sets containing simulated pulsations from 4u  1820@xmath030 of various pulsed fractions , for a range of companion masses ( 0.02_@xmath3  @xmath4  0.3_@xmath3 ) , and for several spin frequencies . for the purpose of the simulations",
    ", we assumed the known orbital period of 685  s , a typical _ rxte _ observation duration ( 20.5  ks ) , a count rate of 2050 counts per second , an inclination angle of 60@xmath10 , and a circular orbit .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the results of the simulations for this type of search run on data sets containing fake 3  ms sinusoidal pulsations .",
    "every point in the figure corresponds to 100 searched data sets .",
    "the shading of every point corresponds to the detected power of the signal .",
    "the power was then converted to probability and multiplied by the number of independent trials ( roughly the original number of time bins ) to convert it to @xmath24 . in figure",
    "[ figure3 ] , the line of @xmath24 = 5 indicates the value of our 95% confidence upper limit on the pulsed fraction for a signal period of 3  ms .",
    "this value varied between 0.55% and 1.0% ( background unsubtracted ) over the range of companion masses that we used .",
    "the value was unaffected by the background correction since the background was small compared to the source count rate : using the ` ftool ' ` pcabackest ` , we estimated the background count to be 10 counts per second per pcu .",
    "this is only 2% of the typical count rate of the source .",
    "this means that if there were a 3-ms coherent pulsation coming from 4u  1820@xmath030 with a pulsed fraction equal to or higher than the upper limit stated above , our searches would have detected it at @xmath57 95% of the time .",
    "the upper limit on the pulsed fraction decreased slightly when the period of the signal was larger by a few milliseconds .",
    "this is because , at longer spin periods , the width of the sidebands feature is smaller ( see section  [ sec : tech2 ] ) ; and hence the power accumulated in each of the sidebands is greater .",
    "for example , for a 10-ms coherent pulsation , this value varied between 0.3% and 0.5% over the range of companion masses that we used .",
    "similarly , the upper limit on the pulsed fraction increases for smaller spin frequencies .",
    "our upper limit on the pulsed fraction of possible signals from 4u  1820@xmath030 is @xmath70.8% for spin periods close to 3  ms .",
    "the pulsed fractions of the signals detected from the 5 lmxbs with known signal period ranged between 3% and 7% , for signal frequencies between 2 and 6  ms @xcite .      the goal of orbital - parameter - fitting is to achieve a sensitivity close to the sensitivity one would have if the pulsar were isolated . to achieve this",
    ", one must compute how densely to sample the three - dimensional space of orbital parameters .",
    "such calculations have already been done by @xcite , but in this section we work through them with more details to better understand the effects of small errors in the trial orbital period .",
    "first , assume that @xmath32 is known exactly .",
    "then combine @xmath20 and @xmath40 into a single complex number @xmath58 @xmath59 if the pulsar emits sinusoidal pulsations at a frequency @xmath17 , then the received signal will be @xmath60 up to a phase shift ( which we will ignore ) . if the pulse profile is not sinusoidal , this transformation will happen equally to all harmonics ; we will ignore this too .",
    "suppose that we remove the effects of the orbital motion by time - shifting the incoming events according to a model using the known @xmath32 but @xmath61 .",
    "the observed signal will then be @xmath62 in other words , the effect will be exactly that of a residual phase modulation of complex amplitude @xmath63 .",
    "such a phase modulation produces a comb - like pattern in the fourier domain ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ) . for narrow combs ,",
    "the tallest peak is the central peak : the one at the true pulsation frequency .",
    "the amplitude of the central peak falls off as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a 0@xmath66 order bessel function @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity loss ( in power ) due to a residual phase modulation of size @xmath67 will be @xmath68 .",
    "this means that if we search the @xmath69 space with a sufficient density to fall within @xmath70 of every plausible @xmath69 , we will detect the source with a sensitivity only a factor of @xmath68 less than that we would have for an isolated pulsar . in other words ,",
    "the residual time shifts need to be small compared to the pulsation period .    for this particular situation , we fixed the maximum @xmath71 as 0.032  lt - ms , @xmath42 as 1250  hz , and the sensitivity factor as 0.5 at @xmath42 .",
    "the maximum allowable residual @xmath58 ( which we called @xmath70 ) is then 0.000143  ms . with that in mind",
    ", we generated an optimal grid of trials for complex - valued @xmath58 .",
    "it turns out that the optimal grid ( the one where the parameter space is searched most efficiently ) is a a circle - packing array : a grid where the values of @xmath72 are distributed on the corners of equilateral triangles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the point in the middle of every triangle is the point that is furthest away from the closest @xmath72 and therefore the distance between it and the closest @xmath72 should be @xmath70  =  0.000143  lt - s .",
    "the spacing between any two guesses is then 0.000264  lt - s .",
    "the total number of trials of @xmath58 is then the area of the complex @xmath58-plane containing the trials ( roughly @xmath73 ) divided by the area covered by every @xmath72 ( roughly @xmath74 ) .",
    "this amounts to an approximate number of 50000 trials per observation . with the trials of @xmath58 distributed as we described , our worst case sensitivity to a given signal of frequency @xmath17 is then @xmath75 @xmath14 ( the sensitivity to an isolated pulsar signal of frequency @xmath17 ) . at @xmath76",
    "the value of this factor is 0.5 .",
    "its value increases for signals of lower frequency . for @xmath77 ,",
    "it is 0.85 .    in the above calculation",
    ", we assumed no loss of power due to errors in the assumed orbital period .",
    "but how accurately _ does _ @xmath32 need to be known ?",
    "we can do an approximate calculation : suppose that @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting signal is then @xmath79 this amounts to an additional slowly - varying error in the estimation of the orbital phase @xmath40 .",
    "errors in @xmath40 that are independent of ( @xmath80 ) have already been taken into account by the earlier sensitivity calculations .",
    "therefore , when we calculated the effects of the additional slowly - varying error in @xmath40 in a given observation of length @xmath18 , we could assume , to start with , that @xmath40 is correct in the middle of that observation . at the end of that observation",
    ", we would have accumulated an error of size @xmath81 in the estimation of @xmath40 .",
    "this adds an _ additional _ residual @xmath58 of about @xmath82 . in the worst case",
    ", this is about @xmath83  lt - s . from the difference between the value we used for the orbital period ( 685.014  s ) and",
    "the lower bound on the more accurate orbital period measured in @xcite of 685.0119@xmath60.0001  s , we estimate @xmath84  0.000003 .",
    "hence the size of the maximum additional residual @xmath58 is @xmath7  0.000013  lt - s , which is a factor of @xmath711 smaller than the maximum residual @xmath58 that the spacing in our grid of trials is allowing . in the worst case scenario ( at @xmath76 and @xmath85 ) , if we combine the maximum error in @xmath58 due to the spacing of our trials with the additional error in @xmath58 due to the error in the orbital period , we find a worst case sensitivity of 0.43  @xmath14  that for an isolated pulsar ( instead of 0.5 when the @xmath32 is exactly right ) .",
    "if the error caused by the uncertainty in @xmath32 were slightly larger , it would have caused an even larger decrease in the detectable power , and we would have been forced to search in @xmath32 also .",
    "above , we have extracted formulae for the sensitivity of the orbital - parameter - fitting search in terms of the sensitivity of searches for an isolated pulsar .",
    "these , as well as a small number of simulations , show the following : if there are no errors in the search parameters , we can detect at 3@xmath56 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.17% , and at 5.3@xmath56 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.2% .",
    "if our trials for the orbital parameters ( including the orbital period ) are off by the worst - case amounts , we can detect at 3@xmath56 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.26% , and at 5.3@xmath56 a signal of pulsed fraction 0.3% .",
    "the above numbers are summarized in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "because of the way we are doing the candidate follow - up ( i.e.  folding candidates that appear several times in the list of candidates ) , the occurrence of the signal in more than one observation increases greatly the chance of detecting it : if a signal appeared only in one observation at 3@xmath56 , we would have discarded it as a false candidate .",
    "if a signal appeared in several observations at 3@xmath56 we would certainly not have missed it .",
    "finally , any individual signal that appeared at @xmath86 would have been detected with confidence .",
    "to summarize , our sensitivity formulae and our simulations show reliable detection at a pulse fraction of @xmath87% for the parameters we have chosen .",
    "this is of course dependent on a number of assumptions : the companion must be a degenerate star , the pulsation frequency must be less than about 1250  hz , and @xmath32 must be within 0.0022  ms of 685.014  ms",
    ". it should be noted , however , that these assumptions are covariant : if the pulsation frequency is lower , the sensitivity improves .",
    "if @xmath20 is smaller than the assumed upper bound , we become less sensitive to an error in @xmath88 .",
    "the search described in this paper represents the first source in a larger program to search for coherent pulsations in the persistent lmxbs .",
    "there are currently five known accreting msps , all of which have pulse frequencies in the range of 185 to 435  hz and low luminosities .",
    "the pulsed fractions observed are in the 3    7  % range .",
    "recently , observations of burst oscillations , khz qpos , and coherent pulsations in two of these accreting msps have confirmed that the burst oscillations are indeed at the spin frequency ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and that the khz  qpo separation can be either near the spin frequency or half the spin frequency .",
    "thus , there is now a total sample of 14 lmxbs with well - determined spin frequencies . in 5 lmxbs ,",
    "coherent pulsations are observed @xcite . in 11 lmxbs burst oscillations",
    "are observed @xcite . in 2 of these lmxbs , both coherent pulsations and burst oscillations",
    "are observed @xcite .",
    "we can see pulsations during x - ray bursts and in the non - burst emission in a handful of transient sources .",
    "why then can we not see pulsations in the persistent emission of the many bright lmxbs including 4u  1820@xmath030 ?    for any individual pulsar , an unfavorable viewing geometry or rotational geometry can prevent the pulsations from being seen .",
    "however , a systematic absence of pulsations from all persistent lmxbs would require a stronger explanation .",
    "there are three main categories of explanations that have been considered .",
    "these are : relativistic effects that decrease the observed pulsed fraction , smearing of pulses from the surface due to electron scattering , and surface magnetic fields that are too weak to significantly channel the accretion flow ( possibly as a result of magnetic screening ) .",
    "we briefly consider each of the possibilities below .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors demonstrate that gravitational light - bending effects on emission from hot polar caps can greatly reduce the pulsed fraction : the pulses are distorted and the pulsed fraction decreases as a star becomes more relativistic because its radius is decreasing .",
    "the decrease in the pulsed fraction results from the fact that the gravitational deflection of photons displaces the horizon away from the observer . in other words ,",
    "more of the star than a hemisphere is visible to the observer .",
    "thus , one of the caps is always in nearly full view as the other is disappearing .",
    "it is possible for the pulsed fraction of a given source to be reduced down to @xmath71% , provided the radius of the emitting star is small enough and the opening angle of the polar caps is large enough @xcite .",
    "this fraction is larger than our upper limit on the pulsed fraction , suggesting that gravitational lensing effects may not be the only factor preventing us from seeing the pulsations . also , the five known accreting msps exhibit pulsed fractions of more than 5% .",
    "there is no reason to believe that those systems have a significantly different value of @xmath89 than the persistent lmxbs .",
    "consequently , it seems that the relativistic effects are not the primary explanation for the small pulsed fraction in the latter sources .",
    "another explanation for low modulation fractions , electron scattering , has been revisited by @xcite .",
    "the existence of a corona ( a spherical cloud ) of hot electrons surrounding the accreting star has been inferred from the analysis of the x - ray spectra of several lmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this hot corona is presumably upscattering softer seed photons and smearing out the pulsations .",
    "@xcite argue that it is because of the large optical depth of this corona that pulsations have not been detected from most lmxbs .",
    "they claim that the optical depth below which millisecond pulsations become detectable is @xmath90 .",
    "they also do spectral fits for several lmxbs and extract the parameter @xmath91 . for the majority of the analysed lmxbs they find that the optical depth of the compton cloud is at least twice as high as @xmath92 . for these lmxbs",
    ", they claim that any high frequency pulsations ( higher than @xmath7300  hz ) would be below detectability .",
    "@xcite also make the observation that there is a possibility of finding pulsations in the sources that are much less luminous , because in these sources , the spherical compton cloud is more transparent ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the smallest reported @xmath91 for the spherical compton cloud that is presumably surrounding 4u  1820@xmath030 was @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "in all the other papers that discuss spectra from 4u  1820@xmath030 , the authors used a comptonization model with a black body component to fit the spectra and found that @xmath91 falls between 11 and 13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if what @xcite have claimed is true , the large optical depth of the comptonizing cloud could very well be the reason we are not seeing pulsations from 4u  1820@xmath030 .",
    "the possibility of magnetic screening by accreted material at high accretion rates has been examined by @xcite .",
    "their reasoning goes as follows : to get preferential heating of the stellar surface , the magnetic field must be large enough to disrupt the accretion flow and channel it onto the polar caps .",
    "preferential heating of the surface causes the observed emission to be pulsed .",
    "if the accretion flow is not disrupted by a magnetosphere , the accretion disk is believed to extend almost to the stellar surface and pulsations are no longer seen .",
    "this could happen because the external dipole magnetic field of the star is ` buried ' or ` screened ' by the accreted matter .",
    "@xcite study the ` burial ' scenario .",
    "in particular , they study the competition between downward compression of the magnetic flux by accretion at a given @xmath95 , and its upward transport by diffusion .",
    "they find that the diffusion and accretion time scales are equal for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the accretion rate given by the eddington limit .",
    "this means that for larger @xmath95 there is little chance that magnetic flux makes it to the surface and therefore little chance of observing pulsations .",
    "they also find that magnetic screening is completely ineffective for @xmath98 , so that , no matter how the accreted material joins onto the star , the underlying stellar field would always be evident . the typical range of mass accretion rates in lmxbs is @xmath99 ( @xmath100yr@xmath46 ) @xcite . @xcite propose that the absence of persistent millisecond pulsations from most neutron stars in lmxbs is due to their high accretion rates .",
    "discoveries made since then are consistent with their hypothesis : all five persistent millisecond x - ray pulsars are low - luminosity transients in very close binaries that lie at the low end of the mean @xmath95 distribution for lmxbs with @xmath101yr@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to adopt magnetic screening as the main explanation for the lack of observed pulsations from 4u  1820@xmath030 because the luminosity of this source ( @xmath102  ergs / s ) is on the high end of luminosities of atoll sources , implying a normal ( rather than a low ) accretion rate of the in - falling matter .",
    "@xcite estimated this accretion rate to be @xmath103  _ @xmath3  yr@xmath46 .",
    "in this paper , we have described a search of 4u1820@xmath030 that set upper limits on the pulsed fraction covering essentially all plausible pulse periods and companion masses for this system .",
    "these limits were between 0.3% and 0.8% over this whole range .",
    "we also searched a broad range of luminosity and spectral states ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the luminosities covered the range from 0.08 to 0.25 of the eddington luminosity for a 1.4  _",
    "@xmath3@xmath21 neutron star and a distance of 6.4  kpc .",
    "4u1820@xmath030 is interesting in this regard because the luminosity varies by a factor of three .    for 4u  1820@xmath030 ,",
    "our upper limits are about an order of magnitude lower in pulsed fraction than the known accreting msps .",
    "however , this is only one source and any number of specific features , such as unfavorable viewing or rotational geometries , in addition to electron scattering and magnetic screening , could prevent the pulsations from being seen .",
    "the most interesting conclusions will be drawn once we have a sample of many more sources that have been searched to similarly deep levels .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) julie payette research scholarship .",
    "it would also have been impossible to do this work without the computing power of the beowulf computer cluster operated by the mcgill university pulsar group and funded by the canada foundation for innovation .",

    "<S> ( i.e. @xmath2  2khz ) and likely companion masses ( 0.02_@xmath3  @xmath4  0.3_@xmath3 ) . using our orbital - parameter - fitting coherent search , which we ran on only 11 selected observations , </S>",
    "<S> we have placed a pulsed fraction limit of @xmath1  0.3% for spin frequencies @xmath1  1.25khz and companion masses @xmath5  0.106_@xmath3 . by contrast , all five lmxbs known to emit coherent pulsations have intrinsic pulsed fractions in the range 3% to 7% when pulsations are observed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our searches rule out pulsations with significantly lower pulsed fractions than those already observed . </S>"
