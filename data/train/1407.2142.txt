    "the spin - orbital physics has started over 50 years ago when kugel and khomskii introduced the superexchange model for degenerate @xmath1 orbitals in kcuf@xmath2 @xcite , called the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) model . in cases",
    "when degenerate orbitals are partly filled both spins and orbitals have to be treated as quantum variables that are _ a priori _ strongly coupled to each other @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom , where strong on - site coulomb interaction @xmath3 localizes charge carries ( electrons or holes ) and gives rise to spin - orbital superexchange @xcite .",
    "a principal difficulty in such systems follows from enhanced quantum fluctuations @xcite which may destabilize long - range magnetic order and could lead either to short - range spin - orbital correlations or to new quantum phases .",
    "interplay between spin and orbital interactions leads to various types of magnetic order which coexist with particular orbital order , as in colossal magnetoresistance manganites @xcite , or in the vanadium perovskites @xcite .",
    "the theoretical approaches are rare and notoriously difficult @xcite  while in 1d systems an electron can break into a spinon and an orbiton @xcite , explicit treatment of entangled spin - orbital states is required both in some model systems @xcite , and in realistic models , for instance to describe the physical properties of the vanadium perovskites @xcite",
    ". therefore , the phase diagrams of such model systems are very challenging and are the subject of active research .",
    "another route which makes the studies of spin - orbital physics of high interest is frustrated magnetism .",
    "frustrated spin models are known to exhibit very interesting properties and have frequently exotic ground states @xcite . in systems with active orbital degrees of freedom",
    "such states may arise from intrinsic frustration of orbital interactions which , unlike the spin ones with su(2 ) symmetry , are directional both in the @xmath1 orbital models @xcite and in the compass model @xcite  they contain terms which compete with one another .",
    "studies of such models require more sophisticated approaches than the single - site mean field ( mf ) approximation or linear spin - wave expansion .",
    "exact solutions are possible only for some one - dimensional spin - orbital models @xcite  they also highlight the importance of quantum effects beyond simple classical approaches .    coming back to the kk model",
    ", it explains the origin of the orbital order in kcuf@xmath4 which is responsible for the onset of the @xmath5-type antiferromagnetic ( @xmath5-af ) order at low temperature @xcite , and the quasi-1d af heisenberg structure with spinon excitations @xcite at high temperature . in spite of strong interplay between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom , the energy scales separate and the orbital order occurs in kcuf@xmath4 below the structural phase transition at rather high temperature",
    ", @xmath6 k. this demonstrates a strong jahn - teller coupling between the orbitals and lattice distortions @xcite , which plays also an important role in lamno@xmath2 @xcite and can not be ignored when the data for real compounds are explained .",
    "it has been also realized that the so - called goodenough processes @xcite , involving excitations on oxygen ( ligand ) sites , do contribute to the superexchange in charge - transfer insulators , and the structure of the effective hamiltonian is richer than that of the kk model .",
    "however , we shall consider here just the spin - orbital superexchange models as they arise in the original derivation @xcite from the multiband hubbard model @xcite .    while the coexisting @xmath5-af order and the @xmath7-type orbital order ( @xmath7-oo ) are well established in kcuf@xmath4 below the nel temperature @xmath8 k and this phase is reproduced by the spin - orbital @xmath0 superexchange model in the mf approximation @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagram of this model beyond the mf approach is still unknown because of strongly coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom , and poses an outstanding question in the theory : which types of coexisting spin and orbital order ( or disorder ) are possible here when the microscopic parameters : ( @xmath9 ) crystal - field ( cf ) splitting of the @xmath1 orbitals @xmath10 , and ( @xmath9 ) hund s exchange @xmath11 , are varied ?",
    "it has been suggested that the long - range af order is destroyed by spin - orbital quantum fluctuations @xcite , but this is still controvesial and also other ordered states stabilized by the order - out - of - disorder mechanism might arise @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the phase diagrams of the kk model at increasing dimensionality .",
    "thereby we summarize the results of the earlier studies for a 2d monolayer @xcite , bilayer @xcite , and a 3d perovskite ( cubic ) system @xcite .",
    "we show below that spin - orbital fluctuations and entanglement @xcite plays a very important role here and stabilizes exotic types of magnetic order in all these systems .",

    "[ sec : cmf ] ) .",
    "we show the essential differences between the phase diagrams obtained in these two methods and argue that new types of exotic spin order arise from the entangled spin - orbital interactions .",

    "these striped - af and canted-@xmath5-af phases appear here at relatively high values of hund s exchange in the vicinity of the fm phase , and essentially by the same mechanism as the ortho - af phase in the 2d case .",
    "the most striking feature in the phase diagram of the 3d model is that for negative @xmath10 , the transition from the fully af to the fully fm configuration takes place gradually with growing hund s coupling @xmath40 , first the @xmath26 planes become fm passing through the exotic ortho - af phase , and next the remaining bonds along the @xmath27 axis become fm passing through the canted-@xmath5-af exotic phase .",

    "finally , the 2d monolayer system served us as a testing ground of the thermal stability of spin and orbital orders found in the kk model .",
    "we have found that orbital order is more robust in general and spin order melts first under increasing temperature , as for instance in lamno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "robust orbital interactions occur also in triangular lattice , as for instance in linio@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the most fragile is the exotic spin order found in ortho - af phase which may be expected taking the energy scales of the effective spin couplings .",
    "the other factor that also strongly decreases the temperature of spin melting may be the orbital order which is incompatible with lattice geometry and strongly suppresses in - plane couplings , such as fo@xmath42 order found for negative crystal - field @xmath36 .",
