    "aador ( lb3459 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is an eclipsing , single - lined binary system ( kilkenny et al .",
    "it is a relatively bright ( @xmath3 ) , extremely blue foreground object ( @xmath4 , rauch 2000 ) of the large magellanic cloud ( feast et al .",
    "kilkenny et al . ( 1979 ) measured a period of @xmath5 and found an inclination of @xmath6 .",
    "the duration of the primary eclipse is @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "there is a reflection effect ( cf .",
    "hilditch et al .",
    "1996 ) with @xmath9 and a secondary eclipse with @xmath10 .",
    "photometric investigations and light - curve analyses ( kilkenny et al . 1978 , 1979 , 1981 ) as well as evolutionary models ( paczynski 1980 ) have shown that aador consists of a sdob primary star and an unseen , nearly degenerate , hydrogen - rich dwarf star ( @xmath11 ) of low temperature ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "one hemisphere of the secondary is heated by the primary ( up to 15 - 20kk ) and responsible for the reflection effect .",
    "regarding the evolutionary times of both components of aador , paczynski ( 1980 ) considered the primary to have only a hydrogen - burning shell and @xmath13 to be more likely than to have double - shell burning and @xmath14 .",
    "in order to derive further constraints for the system , kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1982 ) presented the first spectral analysis of the primary by means of nlte model atmosphere techniques , based on uv and optical spectra . from their results ( tables  [ php ] , [ mrt ] )",
    ", they concluded that the primary appears to be a sdob star with a hydrogen - burning shell and a degenerate helium core , whose surface composition is dominated by diffusion ( which is responsible for the low helium abundance ) .",
    "the secondary is close to a degenerate configuration of solar composition .",
    ".photospheric parameters of the primary of aador . [ cols=\"<,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "although rauch ( 2000 ) used advanced model atmospheres for the spectral analysis of the primary , a `` @xmath15 problem '' appeared  there is no realistic agreement in the mass - radius relation between his results and the solution of a mass function @xmath16 and light - curve analysis ( figure  [ mrf ] )  an intersection is found only at @xmath17 ( within error limits ) which seems to be too low for a sdob star .    ) of rauch ( 2000 ) and the mass value ( @xmath18 ) determined from comparison to evolutionary models .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the error ranges . ]",
    "the reason for this disagreement is unclear .",
    "possible reasons may be too optimistic error ranges in rauch ( 2000 ) or in the analysis of light curve and radial - velocity curve , or that the theoretical evolutionary models of driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are not appropriate in the case of aador since these are post - rgb models for non - ce stars .",
    "the spectral analysis of rauch ( 2000 ) was hampered by the long exposure times ( 1 - 3h ) of the available optical and ultraviolet spectra because smearing due to orbital motion could not be separated properly from the rotational broadening .",
    "thus , rauch & werner ( 2003 ) performed phase - dependent spectroscopy at eso s very large telescope and uves ( uv - visual echelle spectrograph ) attached",
    ". one complete period of aador was covered by 180sec exposures in order to minimize the smearing effects and to measure the radial - velocity curve ( figure  [ rv ] ) .",
    "we employed tripp ( schuh et al .",
    "2003 ) , an idl based aperture - photometry package for the reduction of ccd time series , to derive the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath19 of the primary and the orbital period .",
    "@xmath20 could be determined precisely . although additional radial - velocity measurements of hilditch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from january 1994 have been included in the analysis by tripp ( together covering 9695 periods ) , the precision of the period determination of ( @xmath21 ) can , of course , not compete with results of kilkenny et al .",
    "( 2000 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "depending on the data distribution , i.e. many data points in 2001 and the large gap towards the few 1994 data , it appears that the result of tripp simply `` misses '' one period .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , that kilkenny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) evaluated more than 30000 eclipses in 26 years and were even able to set an upper limit of @xmath23 to the period change .",
    "4686  is shown here .",
    "note the velocity jumps close to @xmath24 which are the result of the transit of the cool companion ( rossiter effect , rossiter 1924 ) .",
    "the dashed line is a sine curve matching best the observation with parameters derived by tripp ( schuh et al .",
    "2003 ) . ]    from detailed line profile fits of heii @xmath254686 , rauch & werner ( 2003 ) determined the rotational velocity @xmath26 of the primary . at http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/rauch/aador.html",
    ", an illustrative animation of the orbital motion and the phase - dependent spectral variation is available .",
    "since the circularization und synchronization times for aador are only of the order of hundreds of years and the ce was lost some @xmath27 ago ( section  [ evo ] ) , we can calculate @xmath28 for bound rotation which is in agreement with the results of rauch ( 2000 , table[mrt ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the main aim of this investigation was not reached . due to the relatively poor quality of the uves",
    "spectra and problems in the data reduction of the chelle spectra , it was not possible to improve the determination of @xmath15 .",
    "recently , hilditch et al . ( 2003 ) presented new photometry data and an improved photometric model of aador which verified earlier results within smaller error ranges .",
    "to summarize , the precise @xmath15 determination is still a crucial point for the understanding of the evolution of aador .",
    "based on measurements of the light curve and the radial - velocity curve , paczynski ( 1980 ) presented an early model with a primary of about @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with a hydrogen - burning shell and a degenerate helium core .",
    "the secondary of about @xmath31 is nearly degenerate , and probably hydrogen rich .",
    "aador had an initial period of @xmath32 and a separation of @xmath33 .",
    "it experienced a ce phase , during which the separation was reduced to @xmath34 .",
    "about @xmath27 ago , the ce was lost . since then , the primary is burning hydrogen and has shrunk from roche lobe ( rl ) filling dimensions to its present size , while the secondary is contracting on a gravitational contraction time scale . in less than @xmath35 ,",
    "nuclear burning will cease , and both components will cool off . in about @xmath36 , @xmath37 will decrease to about 38 minutes before the secondary fills its rl then and mass transfer onto the primary will result in a short - period cataclysmic variable .",
    "hilditch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) assumed @xmath38 and calculated @xmath39 .",
    "the secondary has then @xmath40 and @xmath41 in excellent agreement with the lowest mass zams models of dorman et al .",
    "the primary had an initial mass of @xmath42 and has undergone `` late case b mass transfer '' ( iben & livio 1993 ) .",
    "the lower spectroscopic mass of @xmath43 ( rauch 2000 , table  [ mrt ] ) suggests that aador is a `` low mass case b '' ( rl filled just before he ignition ) system ( iben & livio 1993 ) .    with its extraordinary low mass of @xmath44 m ( rauch 2000 ) , the secondary lies formally within the brown - dwarf mass range ( @xmath45 ) and is burning deuterium in its core but it is even possible that this is a former planet ( @xmath46 ) which has survived the ce phase ( @xmath47 ) and has gained mass via rl overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "an alternate scenario is that a planet over the same critical mass limit gains mass directly from the wind and the envelope of the primary ( livio & soker 1984 ) .",
    "however , due to the low mass of the system , all these scenarios have a severe problem  loss of orbital energy and angular momentum , i.e. when the secondary once started to spiral - in during the ce phase , there might be no way to avoid its collision with the core of the primary . in other words , since the initial mass of the primary was @xmath48 ( just to arrive at its present evolutionary phase ) , then an envelope of more than @xmath49 has to be entirely ejected by the secondary of only @xmath50 which appears impossible ( eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton 2002 ) .",
    "recently , eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton ( 2002 ) proposed a scenario which appears not generally to end up with a merger described above . in a first stage , a `` case am '' ( m : mass - loss dominated ) mass transfer takes place .",
    "the primary may either loose 75% of its mass without ever filling its rl while evolving to a red subgiant and then to a hot subdwarf or two minor episodes of rlof occur with a substantial detached phase .",
    "later , `` case al '' ( l : late overtaking ) mass transfer follows , where the secondary fills its rl , and initiates reverse mass transfer . in the following ce phase , there will be a spiral - in which , depending on the remaining envelope mass , ends with a merger or a detached close binary . in the case of aador ,",
    "the binary would start with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the secondary spins up the primary on its way up the giant branch and thus , there will be a substantial mass loss combined with minimum angular - momentum loss .",
    "rlof starts when the system arrives at @xmath54 , @xmath52 , and @xmath55 .",
    "since the envelope mass is now @xmath56 , it may be expelled by the secondary without spiraling in to the core of the primary .",
    "the evolutionary scenario of the pceb aador is still unclear , although eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton ( 2002 ) have little doubt to be able to adjust their model ( see section  [ evo ] ) to obtain good agreement with aador .",
    "however , little is known about the secondary .",
    "thus , it would be a valuable approach to hunt for weak spectral signatures of the secondary ( cf .",
    "rucinski 2002 ) in high - resolution and high - sn spectra or to try to measure its radial - velocity curve using the reflected light .",
    "a disagreement remains between the results of spectral analysis and light curve and radial - velocity curve analysis ( see section  [ prob ] ) .",
    "the validity of the latter has been verified recently by hilditch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and thus , it appears likely that the spectral analysis yields  by an unknown reason so far  a too - low value of @xmath15 . since the decrement of the hydrogen balmer series is very sensitive to variation of @xmath15 ( e.g. rauch et al .",
    "1998 ) , the analysis of medium - resolution and very high - sn optical spectra , covering the wavelength range down to the balmer edge , would be a suitable way to attack this problem .",
