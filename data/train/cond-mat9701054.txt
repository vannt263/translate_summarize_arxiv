    "the direct observation of monolayers at the air / water interface by the methods of polarized fluorescence microscopy ( pfm)@xcite and brewster angle microscopy ( bam)@xcite reveals that the films possess complex textures similar to those observed in liquid crystals .",
    "the textures are generally found in `` tilted '' phases , i.e. in phases in which the long axes of the molecules in the film are are not perpendicular to the water surface but are uniformly tilted with respect to the normal .",
    "the textures are the result of the spontaneous organization of the molecular tilt azimuth on macroscopic length scales .",
    "they can be understood , at least qualitatively , in terms of continuum elastic theories of smectic liquid crystals@xcite .",
    "many striking textures have been found in domains of condensed tilted phases , such as the @xmath0 phase , that are surrounded by an isotropic phase , either liquid [ often designated @xmath1 , ( liquid - expanded ) or @xmath2 or gas ( @xmath3)@xcite . among those textures are boojums , in which the tilt azimuth varies continuously and appears to radiate in some cases from a defect located at the edge of the domain and in others from a `` virtual '' defect in the isotropic phase .",
    "the shapes of domains that contain the boojum texture are not round ; they have a cusp - like deformation pointing toward the defect .",
    "in essence , the equilibrium shape of a domain containing a boojum is like the equilibrium shape of a crystal , which can be calculated with the use of the wulff construction@xcite . in that procedure",
    "it is assumed that the surface energy of the crystal is determined solely by the anisotropy of the bulk energy . for a monolayer domain containing a texture",
    "this is not the case ; the boundary  more properly , line  energy is comparable to the energy associated with the alignment of the tilt azimuth , so shape and texture must be calculated self - consistently .    such a calculation has been performed by rudnick and bruinsma@xcite , who showed that there is a cusp on the domain boundary , quantified by an `` excluded '' angle @xmath4 that varies with @xmath5 , the radius of the domain .",
    "their results are displayed concisely in fig .",
    "[ r+b ] , which contains a pictorial definition of @xmath4 and a plot of @xmath4 versus @xmath6 .",
    "the excluded angle is equal to zero when the domain is circular and increases as the cusp sharpens .",
    "rudnick and bruinsma predict that @xmath4 vanishes in the limit @xmath7 and that the angle is initially linear in @xmath8 .",
    "the excluded angle goes through a maximum and then decreases to zero for sufficiently small domains .",
    "schwartz , et al.@xcite made pfm measurements of @xmath4 for domains of pentadecanoic acid ranging in size from 12 to 120 @xmath9 m .",
    "they found that the excluded angle increases with @xmath6 , but roughly as a power law with an exponent of 0.3 rather than unity .",
    "there was no evidence of a maximum .",
    "rivire and meunier@xcite carried out bam studies of condensed domains of hexadecanoic acid surrounded by a gaseous phase and measured the distance , @xmath10 , of the virtual defect from the domain edge as a function of @xmath5 . by assuming that the deformation of the domain is small",
    ", they were able to derive a relation between the quantity @xmath11 and the domain radius from continuum elastic theory .",
    "they compared the calculated and measured plots of @xmath12 versus @xmath5 and were able to obtain values for the ratio of the bend / splay elastic constant to the anisotropic part of the line tension .",
    "they also made a qualitative comparison between the measured elongation of the boojum - containing domains and the elongation calculated from a generalized gibbs - thompson equation that was obtained by galatola and fournier@xcite , this under the assumption that the texture is that of an undistorted boojum .",
    "experimental tests of the theory have been limited by the small range of domain sizes that could be examined by optical microscopy . in this paper",
    "we report new measurements of the excluded angle for much smaller domains .",
    "this has been accomplished by transferring the monolayers to a solid support by the langmuir - blodgett technique and obtaining images with the use of scanning force microscopy .",
    "we also describe measurements on `` inverse '' boojums , which occur when there is a `` bubble '' of isotropic phase imbedded in a tilted phase . a new theoretical analysis of the boojum problem , which is an extension and reformulation of the treatment of rudnick and bruinsma ,",
    "is then described .",
    "comparisons are made between the experiments and this theory .",
    "monolayers of pentadecanoic acid ( nu - chek prep , @xmath13 99% ) were deposited from chloroform ( fisher spectranalyzed ) solutions onto water ( millipore milli - q , ph 5.5 ) in a nima type 611 trough .",
    "they were transferred onto mica substrates that had been freshly cleaved with adhesive tape and immediately inserted into the water subphase .",
    "the transfers were performed by withdrawing the mica from the subphase at constant speeds ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm / min .",
    "boojums of the @xmath0 phase surrounded by the @xmath1 phase were obtained in the coexistence region at temperatures between 15 and 25@xmath14c ; boojums of the @xmath3 phase surrounded by the @xmath0 phase were obtained in transfers at 7@xmath14c .",
    "the transferred monolayers were imaged with a scanning force microscope ( sfm ) ( park scientific instruments ) using a 100-@xmath9 m scanner at room temperature in ambient atmosphere .",
    "the instrument was calibrated on the micrometer scale by imaging grids with known spacings and on the nanometer scale with mica standards . a microfabrication triangular si@xmath15n@xmath16 cantilever with a normal spring constant of 0.05 n / m was used for the measurements . the vertical bending and lateral torsion of the cantilever",
    "were monitored by reflecting a laser bean from the end of the cantilever into a four - segment photodetector so that the topographic and frictional force images of the samples could be obtained simultaneously and independently of each other .",
    "all images were obtained in the constant - force mode .",
    "the loading forces ranged from 1 to 5 @xmath9n .",
    "brewster angle microscope images of langmuir monolayers were obtained with an instrument of our own construction .",
    "details of the instrument and the experimental procedures can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the key to the success of the experiment is the requirement that the boojums survive the transfer process and that their shape on the support be the same as that on the water surface .",
    "it has often been observed that the continuous @xmath1 phase breaks up into small islands when it is transferred to a solid support . the behavior has been found in monolayers of stearic acid deposited on thin polyethyleneimine films@xcite , dimyristolyphosphatidic acid deposited on glass@xcite and octadecyltrichlorosilane on acid - treated mica@xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ domainpicture](a ) , despite the breakup of the @xmath1 phase , the boojum shapes of the @xmath0 phase survive .",
    "lb transfer is also known to cause flow in monolayers@xcite , and there is evidence of this in the transfers made at 2 mm / min . as is evident in fig .",
    "[ domainpicture](b ) , the domains are elongated in the dipping direction",
    ". however , at 0.5 mm / min no distortion is evident and the boojums are not aligned in the dipping direcion .    a plot of the excluded angle against the reciprocal of the domain diameter is shown in fig .",

    "the same data are displayed in a log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ domaindata2 ] . in the range 10",
    "- 20 @xmath9 m the data from the sfm studies agree with those obtained earlier by pfm@xcite .",
    "we note that the slope of the log - log plot at large @xmath5 is less than unity , and that there is a non - zero intercept in the @xmath4 vs @xmath6 plot .",
    "the fact that the intercept is not zero had been overlooked in the earlier work , in which the data were presented on a log - log plot . by extending the measurements to smaller domains",
    "we have observed that there is a maximum and that the small domains become circular .",
    "there is no evidence of a cusp in domains smaller than 2 @xmath9 m in diameter ; see fig .",
    "[ domainpicture](c ) .",
    "the good agreement between the pfm and sfm studies for the larger domains gives us confidence that the shapes have not been seriously changed during the transfer process or greatly affected by the change in substrate .",
    "we can not be certain that this is true of the smaller domains , but it does seem likely that the effect of hydrodynamic flows and variations in the substrate will be most serious in the larger domains .    in the pfm studies @xcite it was observed that inclusions of the @xmath1 phase in the @xmath0 domains also had cusps .",
    "when we examined films at temperatures below the @xmath1-@xmath0-@xmath3 triple point at 13@xmath14c@xcite , we found similar cusp - shaped regions in the isotropic @xmath3 phase surrounded by the anisotropic @xmath0 phase .",
    "these domains also survive transfer to a solid support .",
    "[ friction ] is a frictional force image of such an `` inverse '' boojum .",
    "the frictional force within the `` inverse '' boojum is high because the tip images the mica substrate and not the dilute @xmath3 phase .",
    "this is also confirmed by the topographic image , which was obtained simultaneously .",
    "the height profile shows that the inverse boojum extends to the substrate surface .",
    "measurements of the excluded angles in these inverse boojums as a function of their radii are plotted in fig .",
    "[ bubbledata1 ] .",
    "the behavior is similar to that found for the ordinary boojums ; the excluded angle has a nonzero intercept , increases roughly as @xmath17 , goes through a maximum and falls to zero .",
    "included in the figure are three points obtained from bam studies of inverse boojums in langmuir monolayers of pentadecanoic acid .",
    "there is a reasonable agreement with the sfm experiments for large domains .",
    "however , cusp angles are difficult to measure in small domains by bam",
    ". they can be more easily and precisely measured by fluorescence microscopy , but the precipitation of the probe in the @xmath0-@xmath3 two - phase region made this impossible .",
    "the boojum texture is an outcome of the competition between bulk and boundary energies in a bounded domain containing a condensed phase .",
    "when the boundary energy has the particular anisotropic form displayed below , and the domain is a perfect circle , this texture is an exact solution to the energy minimization equations@xcite . at the same time as the @xmath18-like order parameter adjusts in response to the imperatives of energy minimization , the boundary also distorts so as to accomodate the now inhomogeneous environment presented by the texture .",
    "it has been found that when the energy is as given by eqs .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) and ( [ simplesig ] ) , a circular domain satisfies the extremum equations .",
    "this means that the simple version of the energy of a domain in a langmuir monolayer leads to a liquid - condensed - phase domain supporting a nontrivial texture whose boundary is perfectly circular . to explain the domain shapes observed in the experiments reported here and previously @xcite it is necessary to introduce elaborations on the system s energy .",
    "the addition of a higher - order harmonic term to the line tension does give rise to a distortion of the boundary @xcite and a feature in the form of a cusp appears .",
    "the theory is in qualitative accord with the experiments except in the limiting large - domain behavior , where it predicts that the cusp angle vanishes rather than going to a limiting non - zero value as observed for both domains and bubbles .",
    "the shape of bubbles of an isotropic phase inside an ordered phase was not considered in the theory .",
    "when there is a two - dimensional bubble of gas phase inside an extended region of the liquid - condensed phase a texture appears in the liquid - condensed phase that is closely related to the virtual boojum observed in two - dimensional liquid - condensed droplets .",

    "regions of constant intensity on the pattern correspond to portions of the texture in which the order parameter points in a fixed direction . in the case of the inverse virtual boojum",
    ", there should be an analogous signature of the texture in the surrounding condensed phase .",
    "( [ invsbooj ] ) one finds straightforwardly that the orientation of the order parameter is constant along the perimeter of a circle .",
