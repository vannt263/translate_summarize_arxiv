    "communities of ranked players occur in a variety of situations . casinos routinely accommodate live player communities engaged in gambling activities .",
    "casino players may be ranked by the total value of their casino tokens .",
    "traditional board ( e.g. , chess , backgammon , go , etc . ) and card ( e.g. , bridge ) games also bring together gaming communities centered around gaming federations . in this case , players are ranked by strength of play ; e.g. , the elo system . with the advent of the internet , society experienced , like never before , an increase in the number of gaming communities .",
    "first , the internet has strengthen existent gaming communities .",
    "second , massive multiplayer on - line games ( mmog ) of various type ( e.g. , role - playing , real - time or turn - based strategy , simulations of sports or racing events , etc . )",
    "were made available to host gaming communities in cyberspace .",
    "popular mmogs have been : ultima online , everquest and world of warcraft , to name a few . nearly all mmogs use virtual currency that players earn and spend during the game .",
    "hence , players are easily ranked by the amount of virtual currency .",
    "generally , the gaming experience of one player is divided into a large numbers of matches , which are single player , multiplayer or , possibly , team encounters , where the number of players involved is much smaller than the community size . as a result of playing ,",
    "individuals acquire gaming experience and their ranks change actively .",
    "this setup , known as an iterated or repeated game @xcite , has been extensively applied to the prisoner s dilemma @xcite , as well as other dilemmas @xcite .",
    "the focus of previous work has been primarily finding game strategies which have good return @xcite and differentiating traits of these strategies @xcite .",
    "repeated zero - sum games have received substantially less atention @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a model for a community of players who mix strongly and meet in random pairs to play one - on - one matches .",
    "we assume that , as a result , their ranks change according to the rule of a zero - sum game .",
    "hence , game rank does not stand for strength of play and may be more approriately regarded as a game asset .",
    "this setup is equivalent to that of a community of players who play their assets according to a zero - sum game .",
    "the zero - sum postulate guarantees that the assets ( or ranks ) of all players combined are conserved , and provide the possibility for a stationary distribution of assets to exist .",
    "assuming that players play such that they avoid bankruptcy , we study the dynamics of asset distribution , using both analytical and computational tools .",
    "we cosider @xmath0 individuals and denote their assets by @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that individuals pair up randomly , irrespective of game rank , to play matches of a zero - sum game .",
    "say , player @xmath3 meeets player @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that player @xmath3 wins the match against player @xmath4 with probability @xmath6 and is rewarded @xmath7 by player @xmath4 .",
    "thus , with probability @xmath6 , the assets are updated as follows @xmath8 in turn , player @xmath4 wins the match with probability @xmath9 and then is rewarded @xmath10 by player @xmath3 . hence , with probability @xmath11 , the assets are updated as follows @xmath12 we require @xmath13 be continuous functions , such that players never go bankrupt ; i.e. , players never reach zero assets paying for a match .",
    "examples of @xmath14 will be given subsequently .",
    "we formally consider a time axis to order the gambling events consistently , at a rate of one event per unit time .",
    "hence , time is a counter for the total number of matches .",
    "the symbol @xmath15 stands for the normalized distribution of the asset @xmath16 over the entire community , at time @xmath17 .",
    "we write the backward kolmogorov equation for the game , where @xmath18 is the probability density that a player with asset @xmath1 meets a player with asset @xmath19 for a match at time @xmath17 @xmath20=-f_t(a_i)f_t(a_j)+p_i(a'_i , a'_j)f_t(a'_i)f_t(a'_j)+p_j(a''_i , a''_j)f_t(a''_i)f_t(a''_j),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 such that @xmath22 are @xmath23 are the assets possible for the players @xmath3 and @xmath4 at previous time .",
    "we are interested in equilibrium distributions of @xmath16 , satisfying eq .  .",
    "particularly , we look for fixed - point solutions that are differentiable with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the fixed - point equation resulting from eq .",
    "is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss a community consisting on @xmath0 gamblers that meet in random pairs to bet their assets on a coin toss .",
    "hence , @xmath27 are constant functions , independent of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that , to avoid bankruptcy , each gambler bets half of his assets ; i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the long - term distribution of assets in large communities where @xmath31 .    to solve eq .  , we consider @xmath28 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the vicinity of zero .",
    "we expand @xmath34 in series around @xmath35 , and then formally set @xmath36 .",
    "the zeroth and first order expanssion yield identies .",
    "the second order expanssion yields @xmath37 the only normalizable solution of the above equation is @xmath38 , with @xmath39 . note that @xmath40 is time - independent since assets change through a zero - sum game .",
    "this exponential solution is independent on the initial asset configuration , representing a fixed point of the asset distribution .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the negative exponential is a solution of eq .  ,",
    "provided that @xmath41 are constant functions .",
    "remarkably , the fixed - point asset distribution is independent of the payment functions @xmath42 .    to investigate the stability of the fixed point solution , we perturb the solution of eq .   as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 , at any moment of time @xmath17 that we consider .",
    "we obtain a differential equation which is first order in @xmath45 and zeroth order in @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we set @xmath48 and obtain @xmath49 hence , near the fixed point , the solution of the eq .",
    "has the form @xmath50 indicating that @xmath34 is a stable fixed - point solution .",
    "we recall that time was introduced formally , by the assumption that all players gamble at the same constant rate .",
    "the numerical algorithm is brute force integration of the zero - sum iterated game .",
    "we considered a vector of assets with @xmath51 entries .",
    "we randomly chose pairs of players , carried out a match for each pair , recorded the changes in the assets and repeated the process @xmath52 times .",
    "this ensured enough matches and good mixing between the players .     versus @xmath16 .",
    "the baseline game starts with @xmath53 assets for each player and uses @xmath54 .",
    "we show results from variations of this game , to demonstrate properties of the fixed point solution @xmath55 .",
    "panel * a * shows results emerging from different initial distributions @xmath56 , subsequently renormalized such that @xmath57 : all assets equal @xmath53 ( black @xmath58 ) , assets uniformly distributed in @xmath59 $ ] ( blue @xmath60 ) and assets normally distributed according to @xmath61 ( red @xmath62 ) .",
    "panel * b * shows results emerging from three different payment functions : @xmath63 ( black @xmath58 ) , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is uniformly randomly distributed in @xmath59 $ ] ( blue @xmath60 ) and @xmath66 ( red @xmath62 ) . ]    to check numerically that the asset distribution converges to a fixed point , we ran our game model for tree distinct initial condition distributions having the average @xmath53 .",
    "first , the initial distributions of assets was constant ; i.e. , assets were equal to @xmath53 , for all players .",
    "second , we chose the assets according to the uniform initial distribution @xmath67 .",
    "then , we renormalized the asset values such that the average of the initial condition distribution was @xmath53 .",
    "third , we chose the assets normally distributed according to @xmath61 .",
    "the simulation results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a .",
    "in particular , we note good collapse of the three curves originating from three different initial conditions , following the expected fixed - point exponential distribution .",
    "next , we tested the dependence of the fixed point solution on the choice of @xmath68 .",
    "we started with all players having @xmath69 and consider three cases .",
    "first , we assumed that the loser pays half of his assets to the winner ; i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "second , we assumed that the loser pays a random fraction of his assets to the winner : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is chosen from @xmath67 .",
    "third , we assumed that the loser pays a fraction @xmath70 of his assets to the winner ; i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "note that , in each of these three cases , the player paying @xmath68 does not run out of assets because of payment .",
    "numerical results show good collapse of the three simulations , all apparently converging to the fixed - point exponential distribution .    in conclusion",
    ", we investigated the dynamics of asset distribution in a large community where players meet one - on - one to play a zero - sum game .",
    "we referred to this zero sum game as a coin tossing game to stress out our assumption that the chance of winning does not depend on player s assets .",
    "we found that , in the case where players can never go bankrupt , the asset distribution converges to the exponential distribution , irrespective of the betting procedure .",
    "this result was suggested by both analytical and numerical approaches ."
