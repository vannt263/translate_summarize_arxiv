    "the recent growing interest in the unusual electrodynamic properties of layered superconductors ( see , e.g. , the very recent review ref .  ) is due to their possible applications , including terahertz imaging , astronomy , spectroscopy , chemical and biological identification .",
    "the experiments for the @xmath2-axis conductivity in high-@xmath3 @xmath4 single crystals justify the use of a model in which the very thin superconducting cuo@xmath5 layers are coupled by the intrinsic josephson effect through the thicker dielectric layers  @xcite .",
    "thus , a very specific type of plasma ( the so - called , josephson plasma ) is formed in layered superconductors .",
    "the current - carrying capability of this plasma is strongly anisotropic , not only in the absolute values of the current density .",
    "even the physical nature of the currents along and across layers is quite different : the current along the layers is the same as in usual bulk superconductors , whereas the current across the layers originates from the josephson effect .",
    "this josephson current flowing along the @xmath2-axis couples with the electromagnetic field inside the insulating dielectric layers , causing a specific kind of elementary excitations called josephson plasma waves ( jpws ) ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the layered structure of superconductors favors the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the layers .",
    "the electrodynamics of layered superconductors is described by _ nonlinear _ coupled sine - gordon equations  @xcite .",
    "this nonlinearity originates from the nonlinear relation @xmath6 between the josephson interlayer current @xmath7 and the gauge - invariant interlayer phase difference @xmath8 of the order parameter . as a result of the nonlinearity , a number of nontrivial nonlinear phenomena  @xcite ( such as slowing down of light , self - focusing effects , the pumping of weaker waves by stronger ones , etc",
    "have been predicted for layered superconductors .",
    "the nonlinearity plays a crucial role in the jpws propagation , even for small wave amplitudes , @xmath9 , when @xmath10 can be expanded into a series as @xmath11 , for frequencies close to the josephson plasma frequency .    in this paper , we predict a novel and unusual strongly nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "the reflectance and transmittance of a superconducting slab being exposed to an incident wave from one of its sides depend not only on the wave frequency and the incident angle , but also on the wave _",
    "amplitude_. if the frequency @xmath0 of irradiation is close to the josephson plasma frequency @xmath1 , the transmittance of the slab can vary over a wide range , _ from nearly zero to one_. therefore , a slab of fixed thickness can be absolutely transparent ( when neglecting dissipation ) for waves of definite amplitudes , and nearly totally reflecting for other amplitudes .",
    "this unusual property can be described as _ self - induced tunable transparency_. moreover , the dependence of the transmittance on the wave amplitude shows _",
    "behavior with jumps .",
    "tunable electromagnetically induced transparency is also now being studied in various contexts , including superconducting circuits and other lambda - type atoms ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the large sensitivity of the slab transmittance to the wave amplitude can be explained using a very clear physical consideration .",

    "_ linear _ jpws can not propagate in the layered superconductor ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "so , the slab is opaque for waves with small amplitudes , and the transmittance is exponentially small due to the skin effect . according to refs .  , the nonlinearity results in an effective decrease of the josephson plasma frequency and , thus , _ nonlinear _ jpws with high - enough amplitudes can propagate in the superconductor .",
