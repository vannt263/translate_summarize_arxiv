    "radiation pressure is expected to be important in luminous quasars , e.g. , at high accretion rates relative to eddington @xcite",
    ". however , the intense radiation available to push the outflows can also over - ionize the gas and make it too transparent for radiative driving .    @xcite and @xcite proposed to solve the over - ionization problem by noting that a highly - ionized and radiatively thick absorbing region should develop naturally at the base of bal outflows , near the quasar s intense source of ionizing radiation .",
    "this additional absorbing medium is itself too ionized and too transparent for radiative driving , but it serves critically as a shield to block ionizing radiation and thereby allow the bal gas behind it to reach sufficient opacities for radiative acceleration .",
    "the general picture of bal outflows behind a thick radiative shield has become a mainstay of theoretical models @xcite .",
    "even the magneto - hydrodynamic models invoke large column densities of shielding gas to launch bal outflows with moderate ionizations from the strong gravity environment near the central smbh @xcite .",
    "the shielding hypothesis is also supported by bal quasar observations that reveal strong x - ray absorption with typical neutral - equivalent column densities @xmath12 @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "moreover , sources with stronger x - ray absorption tend to have larger outflow speeds and stronger  @xmath13@xmath131548,1550 absorption lines @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that x - ray shielding is important for the development of bal outflows and , specifically , that a thicker radiative shield leads to more efficient radiative acceleration .",
    "however , this picture is complicated by observations of other quasars with narrow absorption line ( nal ) outflows and so - called `` mini - bals , '' which have smooth bal - like profiles but velocity widths below the standard bal threshold ( fwhm @xmath7 2000 km s@xmath11 , * ? ? ?",

    "in one popular orientation - based scheme , bals form in the main part of the outflow near the accretion disk plane while nals and mini - bals form along sightlines at higher latitudes that ( perhaps ) skim the ragged edges of the bal flow farther above the disk @xcite .",
    "this geometry is broadly consistent with the theoretical models mentioned above ( also * ? ? ? * ) and it can explain the weak or absent x - ray absorption in nal and mini - bal quasars if the x - ray absorber resides primarily near the plane of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the difficulty arises when we consider that nal and mini - bal outflows achieve the same high speeds and moderate degrees of ionization as bals _ without _ the protection of a radiative shield .",
    "this suggests that the shield is not a critical feature of the winds .",
    "it appears to undermine the main premise of all current radiative acceleration models that a strong shield is essential to moderate the outflow ionizations and launch gas behind the shield to high speeds .",
    "it might also require us to abandon current models with smooth continuous flows in favor of earlier schemes that involve small dense clouds with an overall small volume filling factor ( see  6 below , also * ? ? ?",

    ", we present new x - ray and rest - frame uv observations of 7 quasars with extreme - velocity mini - bal outflows , supplemented by archival data for a similar quasar , pg 2302 + 029 @xcite .",
    "the outflow speeds in these quasar are in the range 0.1c to 0.2c , which is 2 - 3 times larger than typical bals or mini - bals in previous x - ray studies .",
    "the extreme speeds require favorable conditions for the outflow acceleration .",
    "we aim to test whether these conditions involve a strong radiative shield .",
    "we might expect stronger shielding in extreme - velocity outflows because they should originate from small accretion disk radii , near the ionizing uv emission source .",

    ".      we can quantify the failure of the model absorbers in  5.1 to be effective shields by examining their influence on the ionization of gas behind them .",

    "the specific ion fractions are c@xmath40/c @xmath56 , o@xmath41/o @xmath57 , and c@xmath40/o@xmath58 for solar abundances .",

    "figure 5 shows similar results for more realistic situations with non - negligible column densities in the mini - bal region .",

    "these results are approximate because the putative shield is not offset in velocity from the mini - bal gas .",
    "nonetheless , the displacement between the dashed and solid curves in figure 5 indicates that the addition of the _ maximum _ shield allowed by our data reduces the density thresholds by factors of @xmath313 to @xmath3110 .",
    "these changes are significant but not nearly large enough to affect the structure of the flow behind the shield or facilitate the acceleration of outflow gas that would otherwise be too ionized for radiative driving ( see also  6 below ) .",
    "all of the models just described , including noc4b100 and noc4b1000 which grossly over - predict the x - ray absorption , fail to be effective shields because there is not sufficient continuous opacity near the ionization energies of c@xmath40 and o@xmath41 ( figure 4 ) .",

    "other candidates for suppressing the flux near the c@xmath40 and o@xmath41 edges are the c@xmath40 and o@xmath41 ions themselves .",
    "these edges are also missing because the shields are not allowed to form  or  absorption lines .",

    "weak  and especially weak  lines in the near - uv lead to very weak absorption at critical far - uv energies below @xmath31200 ev .",
    "conversely , an effective shield that _ does _ have strong absorption at these energies will produce very strong  and/or  absorption lines , which can be tested by uv observations .",
    "the absence of these lines near @xmath77 points to the absence of a viable shield at @xmath77 .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the mini - bal regions themselves have large column densities leading to some amount of `` self - shielding . ''",

    "might reasonably cover the far - uv emission source without also covering the more extended near - uv and visible emission regions .",
    "this type of geometry might allow there to be significant shielding at rest in the quasar frame with no near - uv absorption lines near @xmath77 ( e.g. , for bals with detached troughs ) .",
    "however , in nal and mini - bal outflows the required geometry seems implausible because the shield would need to cover _ only _ the unobserved far - uv continuum source ( essential for shielding ) while not covering the near - uv and x - ray emitting regions ( as seen by the observer ) .",
    "one can imagine geometries that might do this , but they all appear to have serious problems . a thorough discussion of these possibilities is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the main result from  5 is that nal and mini - bal outflows are not significantly shielded in the far - uv and , therefore , the outflow ionizations are not moderated by the presence of a shield .",
    "this disagrees with bal outflow models that rely on shielding at the base of the outflow to maintain sufficient opacities for radiative driving (  1 ) .",
    "evidently , nal and mini - bal outflows are accelerated to high speeds like bals without the benefits of a radiative shield .",
    "one might suppose that this conclusion could be avoided by variable shielding , e.g. , due to transverse motions of a patchy shielding medium near the continuum source @xcite .",
    "in that situation , the acceleration could occur during a past period of strong shielding , under bal - like outflow conditions , while today we see the flow already at high speeds without a significant shield .",
    "however , this scenario does not explain the moderate degrees of ionization ( ) that we observe in the outflows now .",
    "as soon as the shield goes away , the resulting over - ionization of the outflow should appear ( to an observer ) roughly instantaneously because the absorption line gas lies along our lines of sight to the ionizing continuum source .",
    "another possibility is that the nal and mini - bal gas was accelerated in a location with more shielding ( e.g. , nearer the accretion disk plane ) before moving to its observed location ( farther above the disk ) where shielding is negligible @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with suggestions ( based on variability ) that mini - bals form in small blobs or filaments along the ragged upper boundary of the main bal outflow @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear what vertical force would be available to push these mini - bal blobs away from the disk plane _ after _ they have been accelerated to speeds @xmath210.1c .",
    "radiative forces can only drive the flow away from the uv continuum source , directly toward the observer .",
    "the flow trajectories might be curved by strong magnetic fields , but that describes a different model where magnetic forces also dominate the acceleration @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that nal and mini - bal outflows have moderate degrees of ionization , similar to bals , even though they are not behind a radiative shield . if a shield is not needed to maintain these moderate outflow ionizations , then it is also not needed to facilitate the acceleration .",

    "more realistic outflow columns with @xmath3 @xmath1  would imply @xmath86 @xmath60 .",
    "if there is no shielding , the ionization parameter in this gas would be conservatively @xmath87 ( ignoring minor effects of geometric dilution , eqn .",

    "these inferred cloud sizes and densities clearly depend on the outflow radius . at smaller radii , nearer the expected launch point of the outflows (  4.1 ) , the total cloud thicknesses and filling factors are much smaller because the minimum densities scale like @xmath97 ( eqn .",

    "the shielding model introduced by @xcite and @xcite was designed to avoid these problems for quasar outflows by permitting moderate ionization levels at low gas densities in smooth continuous outflow streams .",
    "however , the absence of significant shielding in nal and mini - bal outflows means that tiny dense clouds are once again required . if we accept the prevailing view that bals , nals , and mini - bals are all part of the same general outflow phenomenon , based on their many observational similarities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we need to consider that dense substructures and small volume filling factors are a common characteristic of all quasar outflows .",
    "these substructures might resemble the small - scale clumps inferred from fluctuations in the line - of - sight covering fraction in one well - measured bal outflow @xcite .",
    "the most promising theoretical scheme to explain dense substructured outflows is probably magnetic confinement in a magnetic disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some type of confinement seems necessary because the cloud dissipation times are less than a characteristic flow time , e.g. , @xmath112 yr for @xmath113c and @xmath83 pc .",
    "for example , in the extreme case of outflows comprised of a single  bullet \" cloud the thickness would be @xmath5 cm or @xmath7@xmath114 cm for maximum shielding and mini - bal regions with @xmath3 @xmath1  or @xmath7@xmath115 @xmath1 , respectively , based the minimum densities in figure 5 .",
    "if the internal velocity dispersion is similar to the measured line widths , @xmath116 km s@xmath11 , then the dissipation times @xmath117 would be only @xmath70.2% or @xmath72% , respectively , of the flow time given above . in the more likely event that the flows are comprised of many clouds with individual sizes @xmath31@xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the number of clouds",
    ", the dissipation times can not be longer than a sound crossing time or @xmath710%/@xmath119 or @xmath7160%/@xmath119 of the flow time ( for the same two cases of maximally shielded mini - bal clouds with @xmath108 k , see eqn . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the @xcite model , which draws upon earlier work on quasar broad emission line regions @xcite ,",
    "many small clouds with a low volume filling factor are driven out by radiative forces while being confined by magnetic pressure .",
    "one advantage of magnetic confinement is that individual clouds can have super - thermal velocity dispersions and , therefore , fewer clouds are needed to explain the observed smooth line profiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another advantage of magnetic confinement is that the clouds can maintain a roughly constant density and ionization across the acceleration region @xcite .",
    "this can be essential to preserve sufficient opacities for radiative driving .",
    "in contrast , simple mass continuity in steady - state continuous flows ( with volume filling factor unity and expanding into a fixed solid angle ) requires @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the mass loss rate and @xmath122 is the mass density . while too simple to describe real quasar outflows , this relationship compared to equation 1 shows that the ionization parameter in smooth flows scales approximately with the outflow velocity , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "thus the ionization conditions needed for radiative acceleration are very fragile : at the locations where flow material is just distant enough or just shielded enough to have low - enough ionizations and sufficient opacities for radiative driving , the subsequent acceleration leads to a dramatic drop in the density ( eqn .",
    "5 ) , a rise in the ionization parameter ( eqn .",
    "1 ) , and a sharp decrease in the acceleration . as a result ,",
    "smooth flows can easily `` fail '' in the sense of not reaching the gravitational escape speed or not reaching speeds high enough to match observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* hamann et al . in prep . ) .",
    "it is not clear if current theoretical models with radiative driving have fully solved this problem , even with radiative shielding .",
    "it is clear , however , that the problem is avoided altogether if the outflows are composed of small dense clouds confined by external forces .",
    "finally , we note that none of this discussion answers the question of why the outflows in our quasar sample reach extreme speeds @xmath210.1@xmath22 .",
    "if higher flow speeds require smaller launch radii ( e.g. , by factors of a few compared to normal bal and mini - bal outflows ,  1 and  4.1 ) , then what different physical conditions allow that to happen ?",
    "one possibility is that extreme speeds are aided by unusually soft far - uv continua ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this might help maintain lower degrees of ionization ( favorable for radiative driving ) closer to the central smbh .",
    "a quick inspection of the sdss spectra indicates that the quasars in our sample have weak or absent heii @xmath131640 emission , consistent with softer far - uv continua and higher outflow speeds observed in bals ( * ? ? ? * and a. baskin , private comm . ) .",
    "however , reasonable changes to the emitted far - uv spectra can not solve the over - ionization problem discussed above .",
    "small dense flow structures are still needed if there is not substantial shielding .",
    "we describe rest - frame uv and x - ray spectra of 8 quasars with mini - bal outflows at extreme speeds in the range 0.1c to 0.2c .",
    "we constrain basic outflow properties and test the hypothesis that extreme speeds require a strong radiative shield for extreme radiative acceleration .",
    "our main results are the following :    \\1 ) at least 5 of the 7 bona fide mini - bals (  2 ) varied significantly between observations separated by @xmath312 - 3 years in the quasar rest frame (  4.1 ) . in one well - studied case ,",
    "the variability time is @xmath71 yr @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with bal variability studies and , in particular , with an observed trend for greater variability at higher speeds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "\\2 ) we interpret the mini - bal variations in terms of outflow clouds crossing our lines of sight (  4.1 ) .",
    "this implies radial distances @xmath124 pc from the central smbh for variability times @xmath73 yr , or @xmath125 pc for times @xmath71 yr @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the x - ray absorption is typically weak or moderate , with total neutral - equivalent column densities , @xmath126 @xmath1 , consistent with previous studies of mini - bal and nal outflows but substantially less than bal quasars (  4.2 ) .",
    "thus we find no evidence for strong radiative shielding related to the extreme outflow speeds in our mini - bal sample .",
    "\\4 ) cloudy photoionization models show that the maximum amounts of shielding consistent with our data are not sufficient to control the outflow ionizations (  5 ) and , therefore , not important for the acceleration (  6 ) .",
    "these results apply to shields that fully cover the emission source at all wavelengths .",
    "however , shielding in more complex geometries seems unlikely for nal and mini - bal outflows because the alleged shield would need tuning to cover the far - uv emission source ( essential for shielding ) while _ not _ blocking the x - ray emission near the central smbh and _ not _ covering the near - uv source farther out in the accretion disk (  5.3 ) .",
    "\\5 ) we propose that the outflow ionizations are maintained at moderate levels ( low enough for  and  absorption lines ) by high gas densities in small outflow substructures (  6 ) . if the mini - bal gas is at @xmath83 pc with column density @xmath3 @xmath1  behind a maximum shield , then the cloud densities must be @xmath127 @xmath60   corresponding to total radial extents @xmath128",
    "cm and filling factors @xmath129 . if the shielding is negligible , then the cloud properties are @xmath130 @xmath60 , @xmath94 cm , and @xmath96 . compared to transverse absorber sizes @xmath9@xmath10",
    "cm ( based on measured line depths ) , the outflows have geometries like thin  pancakes \" viewed face on or they occupy much larger volumes like a mist of many dense clouds with a very small volume filling factor .",
    "\\6 ) in the context of popular models that have bals , mini - bals , and ( some ) outflow nals forming in the same general outflow phenomenon , our results suggest that all types of quasar accretion disk outflows are composed of small dense substructures and that radiative shielding is not important for the acceleration .",
    "the best theoretical scheme to explain substructured flows is probably with magnetic confinement in magnetic disk winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
