    "given an ensemble @xmath4 of @xmath0-dimensional vectors ( real or complex ) , the _ phase retrieval problem _ is to recover a signal @xmath5 from _ intensity measurements _ @xmath6 .",
    "note that for any scalar @xmath7 of unit modulus , @xmath8 , and so the best one can hope to do is recover @xmath5 up to a global phase factor @xmath9 .",
    "intensity measurements arise in a number of applications in which phase is either unreliable or not available  @xcite , and in most of these applications , it is desirable to perform phase retrieval from as few measurements as possible ; indeed , increasing @xmath10 invariably makes the measurement process more expensive or time consuming .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of work on algorithmic phase retrieval .",
    "for example , phase retrieval can be formulated as a low - rank ( actually , rank-1 ) matrix recovery problem  @xcite , and with this formulation , phase retrieval is possible from @xmath11 intensity measurements  @xcite . another approach is to exploit the polarization identity along with expander graphs to design a measurement ensemble and apply spectral methods to perform phase retrieval  @xcite .",
    "one can also formulate phase retrieval in terms of maxcut , and solvers for this formulation are equivalent to a popular solver ( phaselift ) for the matrix recovery formulation  @xcite . while this recent work has focused on stable and efficient phase retrieval from asymptotically few measurements ( namely , @xmath11 ) , the present paper focuses on injectivity and algorithmic efficiency with the absolute minimum number of measurements .    in the next section ,",
    "we construct an ensemble of @xmath12 measurement vectors in @xmath13 which yield injective intensity measurements .",
    "this is the second known injective ensemble of this size ( the first is due to bodmann and hammen  @xcite ) , and it is conjectured to be the smallest - possible injective ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the same conjecture suggests that @xmath1 generic measurement vectors yield injectivity ( that is , there exists a measure - zero set of ensembles of @xmath1 vectors such that every ensemble of @xmath1 vectors outside of this set yields injectivity ) .",
    "the following summarizes what is currently known about the so - called `` @xmath1 conjecture '' :    * the conjecture holds for @xmath14  @xcite . * if @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is not injective  @xcite ; here , @xmath17 denotes the number of @xmath18 s in the binary expansion of @xmath19 . * for each @xmath20 , there exists an ensemble @xmath21 of @xmath12 measurement vectors such that @xmath16 is injective  @xcite ( see also section  2 of this paper ) . * if @xmath22 , then @xmath16 is injective for generic @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "bodmann and hammen  @xcite leverage the dirichlet kernel and the cayley map to prove injectivity of their ensemble , but it is unclear whether phase retrieval is algorithmically feasible from their ensemble .",
    "by contrast , for the ensemble in this paper , we use basic ideas from harmonic analysis over cyclic groups to devise a corresponding phase retrieval algorithm , and we demonstrate injectivity by proving that the algorithm succeeds .    in section  3 , we devise a theory of ensembles for which the corresponding intensity measurements are `` almost '' injective , that is , @xmath23 for almost every @xmath5 . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the real case , meaning phase retrieval is up to a global sign factor @xmath24 , and our approach is inspired by the characterization of injectivity in the real case by balan , casazza and edidin  @xcite . after characterizing almost injectivity in the real case , we find a particularly satisfying sufficient condition for almost injectivity : that @xmath21 forms a unit norm tight frame with @xmath0 and @xmath10 relatively prime .",
    "characterizing almost injectivity in the complex case remains an open problem .",
    "we conclude with section  4 , in which we consider algorithmic phase retrieval in the real case from @xmath25 almost injective intensity measurements .",
    "specifically , we show that phase retrieval in this case is @xmath3-hard by reduction from the subset sum problem .",
    "the hardness of phase retrieval in this minimal case suggests a new problem for phase retrieval : what is the smallest @xmath26 for which there exists a family of ensembles of size @xmath27 such that phase retrieval can be performed in polynomial time ?",
    "in this section , we provide an ensemble of @xmath1 measurement vectors which yield injective intensity measurements for @xmath13 .",
    "the vectors in our ensemble are modulated discrete cosine functions , and they are explicitly constructed at the end of this section .",
    "we start here by motivating our construction , specifically by identifying the significance of circular autocorrelation .",
    "consider the @xmath28-dimensional complex vector space @xmath29=u[p],~\\forall p\\in\\mathbb{z}\\}$ ] .",
    "the discrete fourier basis in @xmath30 is the sequence of @xmath28 vectors @xmath31 defined by @xmath32:=e^{2\\pi ipq / p}$ ] ( the notation `` @xmath33 '' is taken to mean a set of coset representatives of @xmath34 with respect to the subgroup @xmath35 ) .",
    "the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) on @xmath36 is the analysis operator @xmath37 of this basis , with corresponding inverse dft @xmath38 , where @xmath39=\\langle u , f_q\\rangle=\\sum_{p\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p]e^{-2\\pi ipq / p } , \\qquad ( fv)[p]=\\sum_{q\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}v[q]f_q[p]=\\sum_{q\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}v[q]e^{2\\pi ipq / p}.\\ ] ] now let @xmath40 be the translation operator defined by @xmath41:=u[p^\\prime - p]$ ] .",
    "the circular autocorrelation of @xmath42 is then @xmath43 , defined entrywise by @xmath44:=\\langle u , t^pu\\rangle=\\sum_{p^\\prime\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^\\prime]\\overline{u[p^\\prime - p]}.\\ ] ] consider the dft of a circular autocorrelation : @xmath45&=\\sum_{p\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}\\sum_{p^\\prime\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^\\prime]\\overline{u[p^\\prime - p]}e^{-2\\pi ipq / p}\\\\ & = \\sum_{p^\\prime\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^\\prime]e^{-2\\pi ip^\\prime q / p}\\overline{\\bigg(\\sum_{p\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^\\prime - p]e^{-2\\pi i(p^\\prime - p)q / p}\\bigg)}\\\\ & = \\sum_{p^\\prime\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^\\prime]e^{-2\\pi ip^\\prime q / p}\\overline{\\bigg(\\sum_{p^{\\prime\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{z}_p}u[p^{\\prime\\prime}]e^{-2\\pi ip^{\\prime\\prime}q / p}\\bigg ) } = |\\langle u , f_q\\rangle|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as such , if one has the intensity measurements @xmath46 , then one may compute the circular autocorrelation @xmath47 by applying the inverse dft . in order to perform phase retrieval from @xmath46 , it therefore suffices to determine @xmath42 from @xmath47 .",
    "this is the motivation for our approach in this section .    to see how to `` invert '' @xmath48 ,",
    "let s consider an example .",
    "take @xmath49 and consider the circular autocorrelation of @xmath5 as a signal in @xmath50 : @xmath51 notice that every entry of @xmath52 is a nonlinear combination of the entries of @xmath5 , from which it is unclear how to compute the entries of @xmath5 . to simplify the structure",
    ", we pad @xmath5 with zeros and enforce even symmetry ; then the circular autocorrelation of @xmath53 is @xmath54 although it still appears rather complicated , this circular autocorrelation actually lends itself well to recovering the entries of @xmath5 .    before explaining this further , first note that @xmath55 , and we can generalize our mapping @xmath56 by sending vectors in @xmath13 to members of @xmath57 . to make this clear , consider the reversal operator @xmath58 defined by @xmath59=u[-p]$ ] .",
    "then given a vector @xmath60 , padding with zeros and enforcing even symmetry is equivalent to embedding @xmath5 in @xmath57 by appending @xmath61 zeros to @xmath5 and then taking @xmath62 .",
    "( from this point forward we use @xmath5 to represent both the original signal in @xmath13 and the version of @xmath5 embedded in @xmath57 via zero - padding ; the distinction will be clear from context . )",
    "computing @xmath60 then reduces to determining the first @xmath0 entries of @xmath63 from @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath5 is completely real - valued , then this is indeed possible .",
    "for instance , consider the circular autocorrelation .",
    "if the entries of @xmath5 are all real , then this becomes @xmath65 since @xmath66=c^2 $ ] , we simply take a square root to obtain @xmath67 up to a sign . assuming @xmath67 is nonzero",

    "this observation brings to light the important role of the last nonzero entry of @xmath5 in our iteration . the relationship between this coordinate and the entries of @xmath64",
    "will become more rigorous later .",
    "the above example illustrated how a real signal @xmath5 is determined by @xmath64 .",
    "a complex - valued signal , on the other hand , is not completely determined from @xmath64 .",
    "luckily , this can be fixed by introducing a second vector in @xmath57 obtained from @xmath5 , and we will demonstrate this later , but for now we focus on @xmath76 . to this end , let s first take a closer look at the entries of @xmath64 .",
    "since this circular autocorrelation has even symmetry by construction , we need only consider all entries of @xmath64 up to index @xmath74 .",

    "specifically , a untf yields almost injective intensity measurements precisely when it is not orthogonally partitionable .",
    "historically , this property of untfs has been pivotal to the understanding of singularities in the algebraic variety of untfs  @xcite , and it has also played a key role in solutions to the paulsen problem  @xcite .",

    "the previous section characterized the real ensembles which yield almost injective intensity measurements .",
    "the benefit of seeking almost injectivity instead of injectivity is that we can get away with much smaller ensembles .",
    "for example , a full spark ensemble in @xmath252 of size @xmath2 suffices for almost injectivity , while @xmath248 measurements are required for injectivity . in this section , we demonstrate that this savings in the number of measurements can come at a substantial price in computational requirements for phase retrieval . in particular , we consider the following problem :    [ prob.full spark mx(m+1 ) solution ] let @xmath400 be a family of ensembles @xmath401 , where @xmath402",

    "one key tool that is used to evaluate the complexity of a problem is called _ polynomial - time reduction_. this is a polynomial - time algorithm that solves a problem @xmath225 by exploiting an oracle which solves another problem @xmath336 , indicating that solving @xmath225 is no harder than solving @xmath336 ( up to polynomial factors in time ) ; if such a reduction exists , we write @xmath412 . for example , any efficient phase retrieval procedure for @xmath408 can be used as a subroutine to solve @xmath403 $ ] , indicating that phase retrieval for @xmath408 is at least as hard as @xmath403 $ ] . a problem @xmath336 is called _ @xmath3-hard _ if @xmath413 for every problem @xmath414 .",
    "note that since @xmath415 is transitive , it suffices to show that @xmath416 for some @xmath3-hard problem @xmath26 . finally , a problem @xmath336 is called _ @xmath3-complete _ if @xmath417 is @xmath3-hard ; intuitively , @xmath3-complete problems are the hardest of problems in @xmath3 .",
    "it is an open problem whether @xmath418 , but inequality is widely believed  @xcite ; note that under this assumption , @xmath3-hard problems have no computationally efficient solution .",
    "this provides a proper context for the main result of this section :    [ thm.full spark mx(m+1 ) solution is np - complete ] let @xmath400 be a family of full spark ensembles @xmath419 with rational entries that can be computed in polynomial time . then @xmath403 $ ]",

    "note that since the ensembles @xmath420 are full spark , the existence of a solution to the phase retrieval problem @xmath406 for every @xmath421 implies uniqueness by theorem  [ thm.almost injective and sum rank > m ] .",
    "before proving this theorem , we first relate it to a previous hardness result from  @xcite .",
    "specifically , this result can be restated using the terminology in this paper as follows : there exists a family @xmath400 of ensembles @xmath422 , each of which yielding almost injective intensity measurements , such that @xmath403 $ ] is @xmath3-complete .",
    "interestingly , these are the smallest possible almost injective ensembles in the complex case , and we suspect that the result can be strengthened to the obvious analogy of theorem  [ thm.full spark mx(m+1 ) solution is np - complete ] :    let @xmath400 be a family of ensembles @xmath422 which yield almost injective intensity measurements and have complex rational entries that can be computed in polynomial time . then @xmath403 $ ] is @xmath3-complete .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm.full spark mx(m+1 ) solution is np - complete ] , we devise a polynomial - time reduction from the following problem which is well - known to be @xmath3-complete  @xcite :    [ prob.subset sum ] given a finite collection of integers @xmath225 and an integer @xmath423 , does there exist a subset @xmath424 such that @xmath425 ?    we first show that @xmath403 $ ] is in @xmath3 . note that if there exists an @xmath246 such that @xmath406 for every @xmath421 , then @xmath5 will have all rational entries . indeed , @xmath426 has all rational entries , being a signed version of @xmath427 , and so @xmath428 is also rational .",
    "thus , we can view @xmath5 as a certificate of finite bit - length , and for each @xmath421 , we know that @xmath406 can be verified in time which is polynomial in this bit - length , as desired .",
    "now we show that @xmath403 $ ] is @xmath3-hard by reduction from subsetsum . to this end , take a finite collection of integers @xmath225 and an integer @xmath423 . set @xmath429 and label the members of @xmath225 as @xmath430 .",
    "let @xmath431 denote the @xmath213 matrix whose columns are the first @xmath0 members of @xmath420 . since @xmath420 is full spark , @xmath431 is invertible and @xmath432 has the form @xmath433 $ ] , where @xmath223 has all nonzero entries ; indeed , if the @xmath434th entry of @xmath223 were zero , then @xmath435 would not span , violating full spark .",
    "now define @xmath436 we claim that an oracle for @xmath403 $ ] would return `` yes '' from the inputs @xmath0 and @xmath427 defined above if and only if there exists a subset @xmath424 such that @xmath425 , which would complete the reduction .",
    "to prove our claim , we start with ( @xmath253 ) : suppose there exists @xmath246 such that @xmath406 for every @xmath421 .",
    "then @xmath437 satisfies @xmath438 for every @xmath421 . since @xmath439 $ ] , then by , the entries of @xmath440 satisfy @xmath441 by the first equation above , there exists a sequence @xmath442 of @xmath443 s such that @xmath444 for every @xmath445 , and so the second equation above gives @xmath446 removing the absolute values , this means the left - hand side above is equal to the right - hand side , up to a sign factor . at this point",
    ", isolating @xmath423 reveals that @xmath447 , where @xmath303 is either @xmath448 or @xmath449 , depending on the sign factor .    for ( @xmath265 ) ,",

    "based on theorem  [ thm.full spark mx(m+1 ) solution is np - complete ] , there is no polynomial - time algorithm to perform phase retrieval for minimal almost injective ensembles , assuming @xmath458 . on the other hand , there exist ensembles of size @xmath248 for which phase retrieval is particularly efficient .",
    "for example , letting @xmath459 denote the @xmath434th identity basis element , consider the ensemble @xmath460 ; then one can reconstruct ( up to global phase ) any @xmath5 whose first entry is nonzero by first taking @xmath461:=|\\langle x,\\delta_{m;1}\\rangle|$ ] , and then taking @xmath462:= \\frac{1}{2\\hat{x}[1]}\\big(|\\langle x,\\delta_{m;1}+\\delta_{m;m}\\rangle|^2-|\\langle x,\\delta_{m;1}\\rangle|^2-|\\langle x,\\delta_{m;m}\\rangle|^2\\big ) \\qquad \\forall m=2,\\ldots , m.\\ ] ] intuitively , we expect a redundancy threshold that determines whether phase retrieval can be efficient , and this suggests the following open problem : what is the smallest @xmath26 for which there exists a family of ensembles of size @xmath27 such that phase retrieval can be performed in polynomial time ?",
