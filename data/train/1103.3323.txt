    "quantum phases of matter with exotic types of order have continued to emerge over the past decades .",
    "examples include fractional quantum hall states@xcite , 1d haldane phase@xcite , chiral spin liquids,@xcite @xmath0 spin liquids,@xcite non - abelian fractional quantum hall states,@xcite quantum orders characterized by projective symmetry group ( psg),@xcite topological insulators@xcite , etc .",
    "why are there different orders ? what is a general framework to understand all these seemingly very different phases ? how to classify all possible phases and identify new ones ?",
    "much effort has been devoted to these questions , yet the picture is not complete .",
    "first , we want to emphasize that quantum phase is a property of a class of hamiltonians , not of a single hamiltonian .",
    "we call such a class of hamiltonian an h - class . for an h - class , of a certain dimension and with possible symmetry constraints",
    ", we ask whether the hamiltonians in it are separated into different groups by phase transition and hence form different phases . two hamiltonians in an h - class are in the same / different phase if they can / cannot be connected _ within the h - class _ without going through phase transition .",
    "we see that without identifying the class of hamiltonians under consideration , it is not meaningful to ask which phase a hamiltonian belongs to .",
    "two hamiltonians can belong to the same / different phases if we embed them in different h - classes .",
    "for an h - class with certain symmetry constraints , one mechanism leading to distinct phases is symmetry breaking.@xcite starting from hamiltonians with the same symmetry , the ground states of them can have different symmetries , hence resulting in different phases .",
    "this symmetry breaking mechanism for phases and phase transitions is well understood.@xcite    however , it has been realized that systems can be in different phases even without breaking any symmetry .",
    "such phases are often said to be ` topological ' or ` exotic ' .",
    "however , the term ` topological ' in literature actually refers to two different types of quantum order .",
    "the first type has ` intrinsic ' topological order .",
    "this type of order is defined for the class of systems without any symmetry constraint , which corresponds to the original definition of ` topological order'.@xcite that is , it refers to quantum phases in an h - class which includes all local hamiltonians ( of a certain dimension ) .",
    "if we believed that landau symmetry breaking theory describes all possibles phases , this whole h - class would belong to the same phase as there is no symmetry to break .",
    "however , in two and three dimensions , there are actually distinct phases even in the h - class that has no symmetries .",
    "these phases have universal properties stable against any small local perturbation to the hamiltonian . to change these universal properties ,",
    "the system has to go through a phase transition .",
    "phases in this class include quantum hall systems@xcite , chiral spin liquids,@xcite @xmath0 spin liquids,@xcite quantum double model@xcite and string - net model@xcite .",
    "ground states of these systems have ` long - range entanglement ' as discussed in .",
    "the ` topological ' quantum order of the second type is ` symmetry protected ' .",
    "the class of systems under consideration have certain symmetry and the ground states have only short - range entanglement@xcite , like in the symmetry breaking case .",
    "however unlike in symmetry breaking phases , the ground states have the same symmetry as the hamiltonian and , even so , the ground states can be in different phases .",
    "this quantum order is protected by symmetry ; as according to the discussion in , if the symmetry constraint on the class of systems is removed , all short - range entangled states belong to the same phase . only when symmetry is enforced , can short range entangled states with the same symmetry belong to different phases .",
    "examples of this type include the haldane phase@xcite and topological insulators.@xcite    phases in these two classes share some similarities .",
    "for example , they both are beyond landau symmetry breaking theory .",
    "also quantum hall systems and topological insulators both have stable gapless edge states.@xcite however , the latter requires symmetry protection while the former does not .    despite the similarities , these two classes of topological phases are fundamentally different , as we can see from quantities that are sensitive to long - rang entanglement . for example",
    ", ` intrinsic ' topological order has a robust ground state degeneracy that depends on the topology of the space.@xcite the ground states with ` intrinsic ' topological order also have non - zero topological entanglement entropy@xcite while ground states in ` symmetry protected ' topological phases are short range entangled and therefore have zeros topological entanglement entropy . also , the low energy excitations in ` symmetry protected ' topological phases do not have non - trivial anyon statistics , unlike in ` intrinsic ' topological phases .",
    "@xcite    in the following discussion , we will use ` topological phase ' to refer only to the first type of phases ( ` intrinsic ' topological phases ) . for the second type",
    ", we will call them ` symmetry protected topological ' ( spt ) phases , as in .",
    "similar to the quantum orders characterized by psg,@xcite different spt phases are also characterized by the projective representations of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian.@xcite the psg and projective representations of a symmetry group can be viewed as a ` fractionalization ' of the symmetry .",
    "thus , we may say that different spt phases are caused by ` symmetry fractionalization ' .",
    "long - rang entanglement , symmetry fractionalization , and symmetry breaking represent three different mechanisms to separate phases and can be combined to generate a very rich quantum phase diagram .",
    "[ fig : phase ] shows a phase diagram with possible phases generated by these three mechanisms . in order to identify the kind of quantum order in a system , we first need to know whether topological orders exist . that is , whether the ground state has long range entanglement .",
    "next , we need to identify the symmetry of the system ( of the hamiltonian and allowed perturbation ) .",
    "then we can find out whether all or part of the symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ground state .",
    "if only part is broken , what is the spt order due to the fractionalization of the unbroken symmetry .",
    "combining these data together gives a general description of a quantum phase .",
    "most of the phases studied before involve only one of the three mechanisms .",
    "examples where two of them coexist can be found in which combine long range entanglement ( the intrinsic topological order ) and symmetry breaking and in which combine long range entanglement and symmetry fractionalization .",
    "in fact , the psg provides a quite comprehensive framework for symmetry fractionalization in topologically ordered states.@xcite        based on this general understanding of quantum phases , we address the following question in this paper : what quantum phases exist in one - dimensional gapped spin systems .",
    "the systems we consider can have any finite strength finite range interactions among the spins .    in",
    ", we gave a partial answer to this question .",
    "we first showed that one - dimensional gapped spin systems do not have non - trivial topological order .",
    "so to understand possible 1d gapped phases , we just need to understand symmetry fractionalization and symmetry breaking in short - range entangled states .",
    "in other words , quantum phases are only different because of symmetry breaking and symmetry fractionalization .    in , we then considered symmetry fractionalization , and gave a classification of possible spt phases with time reversal , parity and on - site unitary symmetry respectively . in this paper",
    ", we complete the classification by considering spt phases of combined time reversal , parity and/or on - site unitary symmetry and finally incorporate the possibility of symmetry breaking .",
    "we find that in 1d gapped spin system with on - site symmetry of group @xmath1 , the quantum phase are basically labeled by : + ( 1 ) the unbroken symmetry subgroup @xmath2 + ( 2 ) projective representation of the unbroken part of on - site unitary and anti - unitary symmetry respectively + ( 3 ) ` projective ' commutation relation between representations of unbroken symmetries . + here the projective representation and",
    "the ` projective ' commutation relation represent the symmetry fractionalization .",
    "parity is not an on - site symmetry and its spt phases are not characterized by projective representations .",
    "the classification involving parity does not fall into the general framework above , but proceeds in a very similar way , as we will show in section [ cs ] .",
    "actually , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) combined gives the projective representation of @xmath2 and if parity is present , it should be treated as an anti - unitary @xmath0 element .",
    "our result is consistent with those obtained by schuch et al@xcite .",
    "our discussion is based on the matrix product state representation@xcite of gapped 1d ground states .",
    "the matrix product formalism allows us to directly deal with interacting systems and its entangled ground state . in particular , spt order of a system can be identified directly from the way matrices in the representation transform under symmetries.@xcite    moreover , symmetry breaking in entangled systems can be represented in a nice way using matrix product states.@xcite the traditional understanding of symmetry breaking in quantum systems actually comes from intuition about classical systems .",
    "for example , in the ferromagnetic phase of classical ising model , the spins have to choose between two possible states : either all pointing up or all pointing down .",
    "both states break the spin flip symmetry of the system .",
    "however , for quantum system , the definition of symmetry breaking becomes a little tricky .",
    "in ferromagnetic phase of quantum ising model , the ground space is two fold degenerate with basis states @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "each basis state breaks the spin flip symmetry of the system .",
    "however , quantum systems can exist in any superposition of the basis states and in fact the superposition @xmath5 is symmetric under spin flip .",
    "what is meant when a _ quantum _ system is said to be in a symmetry breaking phase ?",
    "can we understand symmetry breaking in a quantum system without relying on its classical picture ?    in matrix product representation , the symmetry breaking pattern can be seen directly from the matrices representing the ground state .",
    "if we choose the symmetric ground state in the ground space and write it in matrix product form , the matrices can be reduced to a block diagonal ` canonical form ' .",
    "the ` canonical form ' contains more than one block if the system is in a symmetry breaking phase .",
    "if symmetry is not broken , it contains only one block.@xcite hence , the ` canonical form ' of the matrices give a nice illustration of the symmetry breaking pattern of the system .",
    "this relation will be discussed in more detail in section [ sb ] .    our classification",
    "is focused on 1d interacting spin systems , however it also applies to 1d interacting fermion systems as they are related by jordan - wigner transformation . as an application of our classification result , we study quantum phases(especially spt phases ) in gapped 1d fermion systems .",
    "our result is consistent with previous studies.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ spt ] , we review the previous classification results of spt phases with time reversal , parity and on - site unitary symmetry respectively .",
    "we also introduce notations for matrix product representation ; in section [ cs ] , we present classification result of spt phases with combined time reversal , parity and/or on - site unitary symmetry ; in section [ sb ] , we incorporate the possibility of symmetry breaking ; in section [ fermion ] , we apply classification results of spins to the study of phases in 1d fermion systems ; and finally we conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "in , we considered the classification of spt phases with time reversal , parity , and on - site unitary symmetry respectively . instead of starting from hamiltonians , we classified 1d gapped ground states which do not break the symmetry of the system .",
    "the set of states under consideration can be represented as short - range correlated matrix product states and we used the local unitary equivalence between gapped ground states , which was established in , to classify phases . here",
    "we introduce the matrix product representation and give a brief review of previous classification result and how it was achieved .",
    "matrix product states give an efficient representation of 1d gapped spin states@xcite and hence provide a useful tool to deal with strongly interacting systems with many - body entangled ground states . a matrix product states ( mps )",
    "is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the physical dimension of a spin at each site , @xmath9 s are @xmath10 matrices on site @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the inner dimension of the mps . in our previous studies@xcite and also in this paper , we consider states which can be represented with a finite inner dimension @xmath12 and assume that they represent all possible phases in 1d gapped systems . in our following discussion , we will focus on states represented with site - independent matrices @xmath13 and discuss classification of phases with / without translational symmetry .",
    "non - translational invariant systems have in general ground states represented by site dependent matrices .",
    "however , site dependence of matrices does not lead to extra features in the phase classification and their discussion involves complicated notation .",
    "therefore , we will not present the analysis based on site dependent mps .",
    "a detailed discussion of site dependent mps can be found in and all results in this paper can be obtained using similar method .",
    "a mathematical construction that will be useful is the double tensor @xmath14 of the mps .",
    "@xmath15 is useful because it uniquely determines the a matrix product state up to a local change of basis on each site@xcite .",
    "therefore , all correlation and entanglement information of the state is contained in @xmath15 and can be extracted .",
    "first we identify the set of matrix product states that need to be considered for the classification of spt phases .",
    "the ground state of spt phases does not break any symmetry of the system and hence is non - degenerate .",
    "the unique ground state must be short - range correlated due to the existence of gap , which requires that @xmath15 has a non - degenerate largest eigenvalue(set to be @xmath16)@xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to an ` injectivity ' condition on the matrices @xmath13 .",
    "that is , for large enough @xmath17 , the set of matrices corresponding to physical states on @xmath17 consecutive sites @xmath18(@xmath19 ) span the space of @xmath20 matrices@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , all mps satisfying this injectivity condition are the unique gapped ground states of a local hamiltonian which has the same symmetry@xcite .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider states in this set .",
    "the symmetry of the system and hence of the ground state sets a non - trivial transformation condition on the matrices @xmath13 . with on - site",
    "unitary symmetry of group @xmath1 , for example , the @xmath13 s transform as@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a linear representation of @xmath1 on the physical space , @xmath23 is a one - dimensional representation of @xmath1 .",
    "one important realization from this equation is that , in order to satisfy this equation , @xmath24 only has to satisfy the multiplication rule of group @xmath1 up to a phase factor@xcite .",

    "for two states with equivalent @xmath24 , we constructed explicitly a smooth path connecting the hamiltonian for the first state to that for the second state without closing the gap or breaking the symmetry of the system . in this way",
    ", we gave a ` local unitary transformation ' as defined in connecting the two state and showed that they are in the same spt phase .",
    "on the other hand , for two states associated with inequivalent @xmath24 , we showed that no ` local unitary transformation ' could connect them without breaking the symmetry .",
    "therefore , they belong to different spt phases .    if translation symmetry is required in addition to symmetry @xmath1 , @xmath23 is also a good quantum number and can not be changed without breaking translation symmetry . therefore",
    ", spt phases with on - site unitary symmetry and translation symmetry are labeled by @xmath30 , where @xmath23 is a one - dimensional representation of @xmath1 and @xmath29 is an element in @xmath31 .",
    "the projective representation can be interpreted in terms of boundary spins .",
    "a representative state in the phase labeled by @xmath30 can be given as in fig.[fig : rep_1 ] .",
    "each box represents one site , containing four spins .",
    "the symmetry transformations on the two black spins form projective representations of @xmath1 , belonging to class @xmath29 , @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the factor systems of the two classes are related by @xmath33 , that is @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the inter - site black pair can form a singlet under symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that the pair forms a 1d representation @xmath35 of @xmath1 .",

    "different @xmath29 can not be smoothly mapped to each other if the on - site linear symmetry is maintained .",
    "therefore , by looking at the boundary of a finite chain , we can distinguish different spt phases with on - site unitary symmetry .        for projective representations in the same class",
    ", we can always choose the phases of @xmath24 such that @xmath27 is the same .",
    "in the following discussion we will always assume that @xmath27 is fixed for each class and the phase of @xmath24 is chosen accordingly .",
    "but this does not fix the phase of @xmath24 completely . for any 1d linear representation @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 always has the same factor system @xmath27 as @xmath24 .",
    "this fact will be useful in our discussion of the next section .",
    "the classifications for spt phases with time reversal and parity symmetry proceed in a similar way .    for time reversal ,",

    "it can be shown , in a way similar to the on - site unitary case , that states with the same @xmath50 can be connected with local unitary transformations that do not break time reversal symmetry while states with different @xmath50 can not .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 labels the two spt phases for time reversal symmetry .",
    "we can again understand this result using boundary spins .",
    "time reversal on the boundary spin can be defined as @xmath51 .",
    "it squares to @xmath52 depending on @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , while time reversal acting on the physical spin at each site always squares to @xmath53 , it can act in two different ways on the boundary spin , hence distinguishing two phases .",
    "@xmath51 forms a projective representation of time reversal on the boundary spin , with @xmath54 .",

    "the white spins form an entangled pair @xmath71 .",
    "parity is defined as reflection of the whole chain .",
    "it can be checked that if written as matrix product states , the matrices satisfy condition eq.[eqn : p ] and parity of the black pair is determined by @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 can be interpreted as even / oddness of parity between sites and @xmath73 represents total even / oddness of parity of the whole chain .",
    "in this section we are going to consider the classification of spt phases with combined translation , on - site unitary , time reversal , and/or parity symmetry in 1d gapped spin systems .",
    "the ground state does not break any of the combined symmetry and can be described as a short - range correlated matrix product state . for each combination of symmetries",

    "we comment on the general scheme to classify spt phases with all possible kinds of symmetries in 1d gapped spin systems .",
    "consider a system symmetric under both parity @xmath55 and on - site unitary of group @xmath1 @xmath74 .",
    "eq.[eqn : u ] and [ eqn : p ] give transformation rules of matrices @xmath13 under the two symmetries separately in terms of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath73 , @xmath65 .",

    "this can be clearly seen from the structure of the representative state as in fig.[fig : rep_1 ] . because of on - site symmetry @xmath1 , the left and right black spin in a pair form projective representation in class @xmath29 and @xmath38 respectively . if the chain has further reflection symmetry , @xmath97 and therefore @xmath95 .",
    "however , if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "the chain has a direction and can not have reflection symmetry .",
    "different @xmath96 corresponds to different ` projective ' commutation relation between parity and on - site @xmath1 on the boundary spin .",

    "@xmath0 symmetry on the pair can be defined as @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "they both commute with parity .",

    "hence these two cases correspond to two different @xmath105 . because of this",
    ", the two phases can not be connected without breaking the symmetry group generated by parity and @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath96 can be changed by changing the phase of @xmath24 .",
    "remember that the phase of @xmath24 is only determined(by fixing @xmath29 ) up to a 1d representation , @xmath39 . from eq.[eqn : r_gamma ] , we can see that if the phase of @xmath24 is changed by @xmath39 , @xmath96 is changed to @xmath106 . therefore , @xmath96 and @xmath107 which differ by the square of another 1d representation @xmath39 are equivalent . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath29(@xmath95 )",
    "any @xmath96 can be realized as the ` projective ' commutation relation , as we will show in appendix [ append_b ] .",
    "therefore , with commuting parity and on - site unitary symmetry , spt phases in 1d spin chain can be classified by the following data :    1 .",

    "it is also possible to have phases where the symmetry is only partly broken and the non - broken symmetry protects non - trivial quantum order . in this section , we combine symmetry breaking with symmetry protection and complete the classification for gapped phases in 1d spin systems .",
    "we find that 1d gapped phases are labeled by ( 1 ) the unbroken symmetry subgroup ( 2 ) spt order under the unbroken subgroup .",
    "this result is the same as that in .",
    "before we try to classify , we need to identify the class of systems and their gapped ground states that are under consideration . as we briefly discussed in the introduction , while the meaning of symmetry breaking is straight forward in classical system , this concept is more subtle in the quantum setting .",
    "a classical system is in a symmetry breaking phase if each possible ground state has lower symmetry than the total system .",

    "this state is called the ` cat ' state or the ghz state in quantum information literature .",
    "in fact , if we move away from the exactly solvable point by adding symmetry preserving perturbations(such as transverse field @xmath228 ) and solve for the ground state at finite system size , we will always get a state symmetric under spin flip . only in the thermodynamic limit",
    "does the ground space become two dimensional .",
    "how do we tell then whether the ground states of the system spontaneously break the symmetry ?    with matrix product representation , the symmetry breaking pattern can be easily seen from the matrices.@xcite suppose that we solved a system with certain symmetry at finite size and found a unique minimum energy state which has the same symmetry . to see whether the system is in symmetry breaking phase ,",
    "we can write this minimum energy state in matrix product representation . the matrices in the representation can be put into a ` canonical ' form @xcite which is block diagonal @xmath229 where the double tensor for each block @xmath230 has a non - degenerate largest eigenvalue @xmath231 .",
    "if in the thermodynamic limit , the canonical form contains only one block , this minimum energy state is short range correlated and the system is in a symmetric phase as discussed in and the previous section .",
    "however , if the canonical form splits into more than one block with equal largest eigenvalue(set to be @xmath16 ) when system size goes to infinity , then we say the symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken in the ground states .",

    "this difference is somewhat trivial and we will ignore it . )",
    "( 2 ) the ground state breaks the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the ground state will be two - fold degenerate .",
    "each short - range correlated ground state has no particular symmetry(@xmath313 ) and they are mapped to each other by the @xmath0 operation .",
    "there is one such symmetry breaking phases .",
    "these are the two different phases in spin chains with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this tells us that there are two different phases in fermion chains with only fermion parity symmetry .",
    "but what are they ? first of all , fermion states can not break the fermion parity symmetry .",
    "all fermion states must have a well - defined parity .",
    "does the spin symmetry breaking phase correspond to a real fermion phase ?",
    "the answer is yes and actually the spin symmetry breaking phase corresponds to a @xmath0 symmetric fermion phase .",
    "suppose that the spin system has two short - range correlated ground states @xmath243 and @xmath314 .",
    "all connected correlations between spin operators decay exponentially on these two states .",
    "mapped to fermion systems , @xmath315 and @xmath316 are not legitimate states but @xmath317 and @xmath318 are .",
    "they have even / odd parity respectively . in spin system ,",
    "@xmath244 and @xmath319 are not short range correlated states but mapped to fermion system they are .",
    "to see this , note that any correlator between bosonic operators on the @xmath320 and @xmath321are the same as that on @xmath243 and @xmath314 and hence decay exponentially .",
    "any correlator between fermionic operators on the @xmath320 and @xmath321 gets mapped to a string operator on the spin state , for example @xmath322 is mapped to @xmath323 , which also decays with separation between @xmath269 and @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry breaking phase in spin chain corresponds to a fermionic phase with symmetric short range correlated ground states .",
    "the degeneracy can be understood as isolated majorana modes at the two ends of the chain@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the short - range correlated ground state in spin symmetric phase still correspond to short - range correlated fermion state after jw transformation .",
    "therefore , the symmetric and symmetry breaking phases in spin system both correspond to symmetric phases in fermion system .",
    "the two fermion phases can not be connected under any physical fermion perturbation .",
    "now consider the more complicated situation where aside from fermion parity , there is also a time reversal symmetry @xmath326 .",
    "@xmath326 acts as an anti - unitary @xmath327 on each site . in this section",
    "we consider the case where @xmath325(spinless fermion ) .",
    "so now the total symmetry for the fermion system is the @xmath0 fermion parity symmetry @xmath328 and @xmath325 time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xmath135 commutes with @xmath328 .",
    "the on - site symmetry group is a @xmath329 group and has four elements @xmath330 .",
    "mapped to spin system , the symmetry group structure is kept .",
    "the possible gapped phases for a spin system with on - site symmetry @xmath330 include : ( 1 ) @xmath331 .",
    "following discussion in section [ cs ] we find that it has four different projective representations .",
    "examples of the four representations are a.@xmath332 , b. @xmath333 , c. @xmath334 d. @xmath335 .",
    "there are hence four different symmetric phases .",
    "( if translational symmetry is required , the number is multiplied by @xmath146 due to @xmath336 ) ( 2 ) @xmath337 with no non - trivial projective representation , the time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "there is one such phase .",
    "( if translational symmetry is required , there are two phases ) ( 3 ) @xmath338 , with two different projective representations(time reversal squares to @xmath52 on boundary spin ) .",
    "the @xmath0 fermion parity is broken .",
    "there are two phases in this case .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath339 , with two different projective representations .",
    "the fermion parity symmetry is again broken .",
    "two different phases .",
    "( 5 ) @xmath313 , no projective representation , all symmetries are broken",
    ".    mapped back to fermion systems , fermion parity symmetry is never broken . instead",
    ", the @xmath328 symmetry breaking spin phases are mapped to fermion phases with majorana boundary mode on the edge as discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore the above spin phases correspond in the fermion system to : ( 1 ) four different symmetric phases ( 2 ) one time reversal symmetry breaking phase .",
    "( 3 ) two symmetric phases with majorana boundary mode ( 4 ) another two symmetric phases with majorana boundary mode . ( 5 ) one time reversal symmetry breaking phase .",
    "( 1)(3)(4 ) contains the eight symmetric phases for time reversal invariant fermion chain with @xmath325 .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies in .      when @xmath340 , the situation is different",
    "this happens when we take the fermion spin into consideration and for a single particle , time reversal is defined as @xmath341 . with half integer",
    "spin , @xmath342 .",
    "note that for every particle the square of time reversal is @xmath343 , however when we write the system in second quantization as creation and annihilation operator on each site , the time reversal operation defined on each site satisfies @xmath344 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry group on each site is a @xmath345 group @xmath330 . to classify possible phases ,",
    "we first map everything to spin .",
    "the corresponding spin system has on - site symmetry @xmath330 .",
    "@xmath344 , @xmath346 .",
    "the possible phases are : ( 1 ) @xmath331 , with two possible projective representations , one with @xmath347 , the other with @xmath348 .",
    "example for the latter includes @xmath349 .",
    "therefore , there are two possible symmetric phases .",
    "( if translational symmetry is required , there are four phases . )",
    "( 2 ) @xmath337 , the time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "one phase .",
    "( if translational symmetry is required , there are two phases . ) ( 3 ) @xmath313 , all symmetries are broken .",
    ".    therefore , the fermion system has the following phases : ( 1 ) two symmetric phases ( 2 ) one time reversal symmetry breaking phase .",
    "( 3 ) one time reversal symmetry breaking phase with majorana boundary mode . ( 1 ) contains the time reversal symmetry protected topological phase .",
    "models in this phase can be constructed by first writing out the spin model in the corresponding spin phase and then mapping it to fermion system with jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "consider the case of a gapped fermion system with fixed fermion number .",
    "this corresponds to an on - site @xmath311 symmetry , @xmath350 .",
    "mapped to spins , the spin chain will have an on - site @xmath311 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can not be broken and @xmath311 does not have a non - trivial projective representation .",
    "one thing special about @xmath311 symmetry though , is that it has an infinite family of 1d representations .",
    "if translational symmetry is required , fermion number per site is a good quantum number and labels different phases .",
    "therefore , mapped back to fermions , there is an infinite number of phases with different average number of fermions per site .",
    "in this paper , we complete the classification of gapped phases in 1d spin systems with various symmetries . based on our classification of symmetry protected topological phases with on - site unitary , parity or time reversal symmetry in",
    ", we give explicit results in this paper for the classification of spt phases with combined on - site unitary , parity and/or time reversal symmetry . a general rule is also given for the classification of spt phases with any symmetry group .",
    "moreover , we considered the classification of phases with possible ( partial ) symmetry breaking .",
    "we find that 1d gapped spin phases with symmetry of group @xmath1 are basically labeled by ( 1 ) the unbroken symmetry subgroup @xmath2 , ( 2 ) projective representations of @xmath2 .",
    "note that in calculating projective representations of @xmath2 , on - site unitary symmetries are represented unitarily while parity and on - site anti - unitary symmetries are represented anti - unitarily .",
    "we apply this classification result to interacting 1d fermion systems , which can be mapped to spin systems with jordan - wigner transformation , and classify possible gapped phases with no symmetry , time reversal symmetry and also fermion number conservation .",
