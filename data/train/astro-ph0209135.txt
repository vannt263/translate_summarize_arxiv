    "solar flares are commonly divided into two different classes : impulsive and gradual @xcite .",
    "the division into these two categories can be done on the basis of the duration of their soft x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "but it is not only the timescale of the events that justifies the distinction : the energetic particles observed in space from impulsive flares exhibit strong abundance enhancements over coronal values ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "impulsive flares are usually dominated by energetic electrons and are characterized by @xmath4 ratios at @xmath1 energies that are frequently 3 to 4 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value in the solar corona and solar wind where @xmath5 .",
    "they also exhibit enhanced @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios .",
    "although the occurrence of @xmath0 and @xmath8 enrichments are correlated in impulsive flares , the ratio @xmath9 shows huge variations as observed by @xcite .",
    "this suggests , that different mechanisms are responsible for the acceleration of the two species .",
    "gradual flares usually have large energetic proton fluxes , small @xmath10 and do not show large @xmath4 or @xmath7 enhancements in the energetic particles , although approximately @xmath11 admixture of suprathermal remnant particles from impulsive flares have been observed in gradual events by @xcite .",
    "the standard interpretation for these observations is that the energetic particles in impulsive events origin in the energy release region on the sun while the energetic particles in gradual events are accelerated via shocks , either coronal or interplanetary @xcite .",
    "abundance ratios therefore are a valuable diagnostics for the flaring plasma itself and in particular the specific acceleration mechanism for the energetic particles .",
    "the selectivity of the mechanism , especially for @xmath0 and @xmath3 indicates resonant processes such as gyroresonant interaction of plasma waves with the ions .",
    "theoretical ideas therefore focus on the unique charge - to - mass ratio of @xmath0 which allows it to be selectively pre - heated or accelerated via gyroresonance .",
    "a well - known theory of the initial set among theories for @xmath0 enhancement was published by @xcite , explaining the preferential acceleration of the ions by electrostatic ion cyclotron ( eic ) waves at a frequency in the vicinity of the gyrofrequency of @xmath0 .",
    "the waves are excited by an electron current and interact with @xmath0 via cyclotron resonance .",
    "a large enhancement of @xmath6 is required in the ambient plasma for this instability to excite waves above the @xmath3 gyrofrequency .",
    "more recently a theory was suggested by @xcite who accounted for the preferential @xmath0 acceleration proton electromagnetic ion cyclotron ( @xmath12 emic ) waves .",
    "these waves are driven unstable by non - relativistic ( kev range ) electron beams and their frequencies lie at around the @xmath0 gyrofrequency at almost perpendicular propagation . in @xcite ,",
    "auroral observations of kev electron beams and @xmath12  emic waves are taken as experimental evidence that @xmath12 emic waves also may acquire a substantial fraction ( order of few percent ) of the electron beam energy under coronal conditions . at the sun ,",
    "plasma emission from tens of kev electron beams on open magnetic field lines is the explanation for type iii radio emission with its equivalent , the u - bursts , on closed field lines ( in loops ) at beam energies of order kev . in order to excite @xmath12  emic waves fulfilling the requirements of this model , electron beams of much higher density than the observed ones have to be postulated @xcite with no direct observational evidence .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to explain from a theoretical point of view that the free energy in the electron beam is transferred to the @xmath12  emic waves and not to the much faster growing ( @xmath13 orders of magnitude in growth rate ) electron plasma waves .    in this work an alternative model for acceleration of @xmath0 and its enhancement over @xmath3",
    "is presented .",
    "the approach is different from the models described above .",
    "while the models mentioned above postulate rather special plasma properties ( @xmath6 overabundance in the pre - flaring plasma , dense low - energy beams ) in order to produce the required plasma waves , the model presented herein explains the unique overabundance of @xmath0 by plasma waves excited as an intrinsic feature of the electron acceleration process itself .",
    "parallel propagating , lefthand polarized electromagnetic waves driven by the electron firehose instability ( efi ) can account for @xmath0 acceleration via gyroresonant interaction .",
    "as suggested in @xcite such electron firehose ( ef ) waves are excited by anisotropic electron distribution functions ( @xmath14 ) that occur in the course of the acceleration process of bulk electrons in solar flares .",
    "although the ef waves are not narrowbanded around the gyrofrequency of @xmath0 as the @xmath12  emic proposed by  @xcite , selectivity of the process is achieved by the natural profile of the spectral wave energy .",
    "no additional assumptions besides the electron anisotropy are needed , and the model can be embedded as an intrinsic feature in acceleration scenarios such as transit - time damping , the currently most popular stochastic acceleration model .    in ",
    "[ idea ] the basics of the new acceleration scenario are described .",
    "the properties of the ef waves under coronal conditions are presented in ",
    "[ props ] .",
    "analytical and numerical results on the heating rates are presented in ",
    "[ heating ] and   [ sim ] . the mechanism for enhancement of @xmath0 over @xmath3",
    "is described in   [ enhancement ] , and heavier ions are discussed in   [ heavy ] .   [ conc ] concludes this work .",
    "among the most promising scenarios for accelerating electrons to observed energies in impulsive solar flares is transit - time damping acceleration  @xcite , the magnetic analogon of landau damping .",
    "the following scenario was presented by @xcite : electrons are accelerated from thermal to relativistic energies by resonance with low - amplitude fast - mode waves having a continuous broadband spectrum .",
    "the magnetic moment of the particle interacts with the parallel gradient of the magnetic field as in the well known fermi acceleration  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the classic fermi process , transit - time damping involves small - amplitude magnetic compressions .",
    "while fermi acceleration is the result of large numbers of particles being reflected by randomly moving magnetic compressions , transit - time damping is a process of rather resonant nature . in the limit of very small amplitudes , only particles of the same parallel speed as the wave phase velocity can be reflected by the magnetic compressions , i.e. @xmath15 which is the landau resonance condition .",
    "interaction with a wave changes the particle s parallel speed and therefore allows it to interact with another wave of the continuous spectrum . in the average",
    "this process results in stochastic acceleration .",
    "the wave spectrum is assumed to origin from cascading fast - mode waves , initially excited at very long wavelengths as a direct output of the primary energy release in impulsive flares .",
    "the cascade channels the released energy through an inertial region to @xmath16-values small enough to accelerate electrons out of the thermal background population .",
    "other acceleration scenarios operating in impulsive solar flares have been proposed and can roughly be divided into three categories : shock acceleration , acceleration by parallel electric fields and stochastic acceleration by mhd turbulence including the model described above .",
    "a detailed review can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "even though the nature of the actual acceleration mechanisms is unclear , all the above mechanisms that can account for accelerating the bulk of electrons up to the observed energies of @xmath17 have an important feature in common : particles are preferentially accelerated in parallel direction with respect to the background magnetic field .",
    "parallel dc electric fields trivially accelerate only along the magnetic field while stochastic scenarios as transit - time damping act via small amplitude magnetic mirroring which is only capable of transferring energy in parallel direction if no additional scattering mechanism is provided  @xcite .",
    "works of e.g. @xcite and @xcite describe the parallely directed energization of electrons at the earths bow shock via shock drift acceleration with quasi perpendicular shocks .",
    "the distribution function of the accelerated particle species in velocity space therefore is expected to become more and more anisotropic in the course of the energization process . while the perpendicular temperature remains virtually constant during the acceleration , the parallel velocity of the particles increases .",
    "if the energization in parallel direction is from a thermal level of some 0.1 kev up to 20 kev or more , the anisotropy in parallel direction is substantial .",
    "the plasma therefore is modeled by a bi - maxwellian with different temperatures in parallel and perpendicular direction . in doing",
    "so it is assumed that no efficient scattering mechanism is present that could maintain isotropy on acceleration timescales .",
    "although it is not expected that acceleration retains a bi - maxwellian distribution function , it is a good approximation in order to describe propagation properties of plasma waves .",
    "as shown in @xcite the efi can occur in such a situation and give rise to ef waves .",
    "the parallel ef waves are purely transverse electromagnetic and lefthand circularly polarized .",
    "the sense of polarization and can change in certain @xmath16 ranges if a similar anisotropy of the protons is assumed . in the following the ef waves are lefthand polarized if not mentioned otherwise .",
    "a representative dispersion plot is depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in the acceleration region , including possible pre - heating mechanisms , reasonable pre - flaring plasma conditions of an impulsive flare range within @xmath18 for the background magnetic field , @xmath19 in number density and about @xmath20 for the proton and electron temperature @xcite .",
    "for the numerical example herein the following pre - flaring plasma parameters are chosen : @xmath21 .    under these exemplary conditions",
    "the ef waves propagate below about @xmath22 .",
    "several ion gyrofrequencies are indicated in figure  [ fig:1 ] and they lie well within the wave spectrum .",
    "resonant acceleration occurs if the condition @xmath23 is satisfied . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the parallel particle speed and lorentz factor , and @xmath26 is the gyrofrequency of the according particle .",
    "this condition is well satisfied for ions like @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the model presented herein assumes acceleration of the ions via the most effective gyroresonance at @xmath29 , the so called _ cyclotron _ resonance .    due to the symmetry of the distribution function with respect to @xmath24 ,",
    "the dispersion of the ef waves is the same for the transition from @xmath30 while keeping lefthand polarization and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the resulting wavefield from the efi therefore consists of waves propagating parallel to the magnetic field ( positive k - branch ) as well as anti - parallel ( negative k - branch ) .",
    "this property of the ef waves is of special interest and crucial for efficient acceleration : a unidirectional wavefield of electromagnetic waves always exhibits a force parallel to the background magnetic field pushing the particle out of resonance , limiting the acceleration time and , hence , the reachable energies .",
    "while other models ( e.g. @xcite ) solve the problem by imposing a background magnetic field geometry , i.e. a field gradient , to force the particle to regain resonance , this is not necessary for the case of the ef waves : resonant acceleration by counterpropagating electromagnetic waves leads to oscillating parallel forces and does not drive the particle permanently out of resonance . in",
    "contrary they naturally trap the particle in the wavefields by bouncing it from resonance with the positive branch to resonance with the negative branch of the wavefield and vice versa .",
    "this ping - pong trapping strongly enhances the total resonant interaction time of the particle with the wave and allows significant acceleration in perpendicular velocity .",
    "the mechanism works even for small wave fields where normal wave - particle trapping is not efficient .",
    "similar situations have been investigated by e.g. inferring counterpropagating alfvn waves to the problem of solar flare proton acceleration  @xcite and cosmic - ray acceleration  @xcite .",
    "this acceleration can be regarded as a special case of wave turbulent stochastic acceleration with waves explicitly counterpropagating in one dimension .",
    "the differences in enrichment of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the result of varying growth of the waves at different frequencies .",
    "as the waves grow from a thermal level to a saturated state , the spectral energy density develops according to the growth rates from linear theory depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "since the waves are excited nonresonantly by the electrons , the saturated wave energy spectrum can be approximated from the profile of the linear growth rate .",
    "this is not true for resonantly excited instabilities , where wave modes can still grow while others have already saturated .",
    "if each mode is in resonance with only the particles fulfilling the resonance condition , some modes can grow longer than others and the saturated energy spectrum of the waves has to be determined by other methods .",
    "however , if the instability is nonresonant as the efi , each mode grows according to the total free energy available ( the driver is basically a pressure anisotropy of the electrons ) and the whole electron population contributes to the growth of each mode .",
    "all modes therefore saturate at the same time , namely when the pressure anisotropy drops below the threshold , and the spectral energy is frozen at that time .",
    "the wave dispersion is altered by the decreasing anisotropy as result of the erosion of the particle distribution .",
    "however , a former analysis shows  @xcite that this does not severely alter the slope in the growth rate around @xmath0 an @xmath3 .",
    "although the differences in growth rates are quite small in the region of interest ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , the differences in wave energy will become significant after several growth times @xmath32 . as a rough estimate one obtains , by assuming constant growth rates in time , that two modes with initial growth rates @xmath33 and @xmath34 and equal energy content have a ratio in energy of @xmath35 after a time @xmath36 of only @xmath37 .",
    "this estimate illustrates the rather strong influence of growth rate on the resulting wave energy level and , hence , on the selectivity of cyclotron acceleration due to the @xmath25 profile in wave frequency .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite shows that the positive slope in the growth rate profile around the @xmath0 and @xmath3 gyrofrequency that is needed to selectively enhance @xmath0 is a stable feature of the efi and not very sensitive to changes in the plasma parameters for solar pre - flaring conditions .",
    "in the following it will be established that the mechanism meets the following requirements for the observed @xmath0 enrichment :    _ ( i ) _ the accelerator has to energize the ions above @xmath38 on timescales of @xmath39 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ @xmath40 @xmath41 above energies of about @xmath1 .    _",
    "( iii ) _ a time integrated total of about @xmath42 @xmath0 nuclei is required to account for the observed particle fluxes  @xcite .    _",
    "( iv ) _ the @xmath0 spectrum is harder than the @xmath3 spectrum in the range of @xmath43 @xcite .    _",
    "( v ) _ @xmath0 exhibits a turnover in the particle energy spectrum at around a few @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a magnetized plasma with a pressure anisotropy in parallel direction to the magnetic field can become unstable to low frequency alfvn waves .",
    "this instability is known as the firehose instability and is of completely non - resonant nature : neither the electrons nor the protons are in resonance with the excited waves .",
    "an extension of this instability to higher frequencies was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this branch of the instability has been termed the electron firehose instability . here , the bulk of the protons is resonant with the waves which are non - resonantly excited by the electrons .",
    "the electrons are anisotropic and drive the waves while the protons carry the wave .",
    "a typical dispersion relation of the ef waves is displayed in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the dispersion of the ef waves is computed by idlwhamp @xcite , an easy to use idl interface to the whamp code originally developed by @xcite .",
    "the code provides the user with the full solution of the dispersion equation in linearized kinetic theory .",
    "the influence of the presence of other majority ions such as @xmath3 on the ef wave dispersion is negligible . for a plasma consisting of 5% @xmath3 and 95% @xmath45 the wavenumber of maximum growth and the frequency at maximum growth",
    "is shifted by values of order of 1% with respect to the values of a pure @xmath45 plasma .",
    "ions other than @xmath46 have therefore been omitted in the following when computing the dispersion relation of the ef waves .",
    "due to the assumed anisotropy of the protons the mode is righthand polarized ( @xmath47 ) at small values of k in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "according to @xcite the condition for the change of polarization sense to occur is an additional proton anisotropy @xmath48 .",
    "such a proton anisotropy could result e.g. from transit - time acceleration as described for the electrons in ",
    "note , that the proton anisotropy is not a necessary condition for instability .",
    "it has been taken into account herein only for the sake of generality .",
    "the dependence of the maximum growth rates on proton and electron anisotropy can be seen in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the proton anisotropy has been varied from 1 to larger values for three values of the electron anisotropy .",
    "only lefthand modes have been taken into account",
    ". with increasing proton anisotropy the frequency at maximum growth approaches and finally crosses the @xmath0 gyrofrequency . with decreasing electron anisotropy less anisotropic protons",
    "are needed to shift the most growing mode to the @xmath0 gyrofrequency .",
    "this shows that for reasonable anisotropies the slope in the growth rate profile in the vicinity of the gyrofrequency of @xmath0 is always positive , such that waves around the @xmath0 resonance grow faster than waves around the @xmath3 gyrofrequency .",
    "this is a very stable feature of the ef wave spectrum and can be expected , once above the instability threshold , for a large range of plasma parameters that allow instability and reasonable anisotropies of protons and electrons ( for a detailed analysis of efi thresholds and spectra in dependence on plasma parameters see * ? ? ?",
    ".    an additional mode can be found at oblique propagation angles @xcite .",
    "for the reported examples , the oblique mode grows faster than the parallel mode .",
    "in addition to purely growing waves , the oblique mode contains waves that may resonate with coronal ions .",
    "relevant for the flare application and mode comparison is the instability threshold and the non - linear evolution . also unknown in this context",
    "are the effects of ion anisotropy , power - law electron distribution and other parameters .",
    "thus we concentrate here on the well known parallel mode and leave the exploration of the oblique mode to future work .",
    "the ion s energy change is dominated by the resonant interaction with the wave s electric field , which is decomposed into its parallel component @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the wave s phase at the location of the ion , and two circularly polarized components @xmath51 with amplitudes @xmath52 . in the fourier domain",

[ acc_par ] ) . for particles not in resonance , @xmath78 changes rapidly and no energy is gained in the time average .    in a set of @xmath80 monochromatic waves , numbered by @xmath81 with equal amplitudes @xmath82 and equally spaced by a frequency @xmath53 with @xmath83 ,",
    "the ion s perpendicular motion has a phase @xmath84 with respect to each mode .",
    "this gives a set of @xmath80 phase equations @xmath85 and equations  [ acc_perp ] ,  [ acc_par ] have to be summed over the contributions of the @xmath80 modes .",
    "the equations of motion are in general not integrable because of the @xmath86 terms in equation  [ set_phase ] .",
    "however , a maximum heating rate and the typical time after which an ion is driven out of resonance by the mean parallel force of the uni - directional propagating waves are estimated . the latter limits the total energy gain of the ion .    within a time interval @xmath87 ,",
    "the energy gain of the ion is mainly due to the wave modes in a bandwidth @xmath88 around the frequency @xmath89 .",
    "the wave may be described by a mode spacing @xmath90 , yielding @xmath91 . at best",
    ", the ion stays in resonance with one mode @xmath92 such that @xmath93 over the whole time period @xmath87 .",

    "thus , equation  [ heat_perp ] predicts a linear increase of energy in time . the ratio q / a is the charge - to - mass ratio of the ion in atomic units .",

    "the so - called frequency mismatch parameter @xmath152 ( where @xmath153 is the @xmath27 gyrofrequency ) has been plotted in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "resonant interaction of the particle with a wave means @xmath154 , reproducing the resonance condition .",
    "panel _ ( a ) _ of figure  [ fig:6 ] displays a small portion of the timeserie of figure  [ fig:5]_a _ and the three vertical lines indicate times at which @xmath155 was computed .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig:6]_b _ , the particle is out of resonance at times @xmath156 and @xmath157 while it is resonantly interacting with both wave branches at time @xmath158 .",
    "accordingly , the parallel normalized momentum @xmath159 does not exhibit any oscillatory behavior around zero at times @xmath156 and @xmath157 in figure  [ fig:6]_a _ but clearly oscillates around zero at @xmath158 .",
    "acceleration is clearly very efficient with an averaged systematic energy gain @xmath160 of @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]_a _ ) .",
    "a linear energy increase is predicted by equation  [ heat_perp ] .",
    "the paths of more than 500 @xmath0 ions have been simulated and exhibit similar energization .",
    "among the overabundant ions observed during impulsive solar flares , @xmath0 takes a special position . whereas most ions exhibit an enhancement by factors of 1 - 10 with respect to coronal values",
    ", @xmath0 shows an excess of @xmath162 .",
    "since it has been established that the selective enhancement of ion abundances correlates with the charge - to - mass ratio @xcite and hence the gyrofrequency of the according ions ,    resonant wave - particle interaction is generally believed to be the accelerating mechanism .",
    "this led earlier theories to the approach of finding special plasma waves existing only in a narrow range in the vicinity of the @xmath0 gyrofrequency . in order to generate the appropriate waves ( e.g. eic waves @xcite",
    ", @xmath12  emic waves in @xcite ) peculiar plasma conditions have to be postulated . in the first case a pre - flare enhancement of @xmath3 over @xmath45 and in the latter case dense low - energy beams have to be assumed in order to excite the waves in the appropriate frequency ranges .",
    "a different approach is investigated in the work presented herein .",
    "ef waves , excited by an anisotropic velocity distribution function resulting from bulk acceleration of electrons , accelerate @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "selectivity is achieved by an energy density profile of the waves self - consistently produced from linear growth . for nonresonant instabilities ,",
    "this profile is approximately true not only during the growth phase but also for the saturated state of the instability ( see   [ idea ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig:4 ] the resulting energy density profile clearly supports an enhanced acceleration of @xmath0 above @xmath3 . the energy density in the wave field is higher at the gyrofrequency of @xmath0 than @xmath3 .",
    "more energy is therefore available for the acceleration of @xmath0 .",
    "the quantitative heating rates of an ensemble of ions of the two species have been determined by numerical simulations where the total energy density in the wavefield has been treated as a free parameter .    in order to compare the simulation results to the observational values of @xmath40",
    ", abundances have to be compared at the same energies .",
    "observations from the _ isee 3 _ spacecraft were taken in the @xmath163 channel  @xcite and observations by @xcite with the _ isee 1 _ and _ isee 3 _ spacecrafts were taken in the @xmath43 range . according to these measurements ,",

    "( iv ) _ @xmath0 spectrum harder than the @xmath3 spectrum in the range of @xmath43 and _ ( v ) _ a turnover in the particle energy spectrum of @xmath0 at around @xmath44 .    in the following",
    ", the presented model is investigated in view of these requirements .",
    "the ability of the ef waves to accelerate the ions to the relevant energies has been shown in   [ acc ] and requirement _ ( i ) _ therefore is fulfilled . in order to address items _ ( ii ) _ - _ ( v ) _ the collective behavior of an ensemble of ions has to be investigated .    from part _",
    "ii ) _ of the numerical simulations ( 5000 particles , short times ) it is found that the population of ions in energy develops according to a maxwellian distribution function for a system of three degrees of freedom @xmath164 where @xmath165 has been normalized to @xmath166 , the density of species @xmath167 .    by fitting this distribution model to the runs of part _",
    "i ) _ ( 500 particles , long times ) the thermal energy in time @xmath168 , and hence the heating rates , were extracted .",
    "the function @xmath169 for @xmath0 and @xmath3 is depicted in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is accelerated faster than @xmath3 and this causes an enhancement at a given energy ( say @xmath1 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 above @xmath1 can now be calculated in dependence on acceleration time .",
    "we integrate @xmath170 where @xmath171 corresponds to the according he isotope , and form the ratio @xmath172 .",
    "it is found that the required abundance ratio of @xmath173 is reached in the time range of @xmath174 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) . due to the higher acceleration rate of @xmath0 ( about factor of 23 above @xmath3 ) , the fast tail of the energy distribution function populates energies above @xmath1 faster than for @xmath3 .",
    "this yields a @xmath40 @xmath175 for small times @xmath176 , @xmath40 @xmath177 for @xmath178 and asymptotically approaches the coronal abundance ratio for times @xmath179 .",
    "the derived time range of @xmath180 corresponds well to the typical timescale of electron acceleration during the impulsive phases of flares of @xmath181 as manifest by the shortest hard x - ray peaks  @xcite .",
    "since the ef wavefield is a direct consequence of the electron acceleration process , the lifetime of the field is expected to be on the same order of magnitude . when electron acceleration ceases , the @xmath40 ratio is frozen and no further ion acceleration occurs .",
    "the time integrated total number of @xmath0 nuclei being accelerated above @xmath182 in an impulsive flare is about @xmath42 particles  @xcite . assuming the flaring area to be of about @xmath183 with a scale height of @xmath184 , the proton density to be @xmath185 and @xmath186 , there are @xmath187 @xmath0 ions available in the flaring volume .",
    "this yields a percentage of about @xmath188 of the pre - flaring @xmath0 population that has to be accelerated above @xmath1 .",
    "computing the value of the @xmath0 density @xmath189 at time @xmath180 and comparing it to the coronal abundance yields a percentage of about @xmath190 .",
    "thus the number of accelerated ions at the required energies is sufficient to explain the observed particle fluxes .",
    "the model therefore also accounts for criterion _",
    "( iii)_.    the @xmath0 acceleration by ef waves also generates ion energy spectra that qualitatively reproduce the observed behavior . according to @xcite",
    "the observed spectrum of @xmath0 is harder than the spectrum of @xmath3 in the energy range of @xmath43 which is a feature of all @xmath0 rich periods in their study .",
    "the according particle densities in dependence on energy per nucleon resulting from the model presented herein are depicted in figure  [ fig:9 ] , reproducing the observations .",
    "a turnover of the @xmath0 spectrum at around @xmath191 energies can be seen in figure  [ fig:9 ] .",
    "this reproduces very nicely the observations by @xcite who reported a turnover at around @xmath44",
    ". it can be interpreted as the result of the whole @xmath0 population being accelerated by ef waves .",
    "therefore it has been established that the efi is not only a viable acceleration mechanism for ions during solar flares , it also can account for the observed abundance enhancements of @xmath0 over @xmath3 , accelerates enough @xmath0 nuclei , and reproduces the qualitative behavior of the particle energy spectra .",
    "the energy density profile may suggest by the same arguments used to explain the enhancement of @xmath0 above @xmath3 , that @xmath45 should be enhanced above @xmath0 , which is not the case .",
    "this is not a real problem of the model because of the very different number densities of the according ion species .",
    "the energy in the wavefield available for proton acceleration is higher than the energy available for @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , there are much more protons .",
    "thus the available energy is distributed among a larger number of nuclei and the energy gained per nucleon is smaller for the protons . by the same argument ,",
    "@xmath0 should be further enhanced in comparison to @xmath3 .",
    "this effect was neglected herein since the scope of this paper is to show the ability of fractionation by the accelerator itself .    when discussing the possible acceleration of the protons by ef waves , other effects have to be taken into account .",
    "whereas , due to their low densities , @xmath3 and @xmath0 can be treated as test - particles , this view is not valid for protons and nonlinear effects as the erosion of the spectral wave energy around the gyrofrequency of @xmath45 have to be considered .",
    "such an analysis requires simulations that are beyond the scope of the presented work .",
    "@xmath0 rich events usually are also characterized by enhanced @xmath192 ratios .",
    "although the observed enhancement of @xmath192 is only about a factor of 8 over the coronal ratio , it is still the strongest enrichment of the heavier ions .",
    "other heavier ions as ne , mg , si are enhanced by factors of 23 above o , whereas c , o , n are not enhanced . in this section",
    "the enrichment of fe ions is addressed and briefly discussed in view of the model presented in this work .    in a plasma at a temperature of @xmath193 ,",
    "the most probable charge state of @xmath8 is 20 + while @xmath194 is fully ionized .",
    "when resonantly cyclotron accelerated , @xmath194 should exhibit the same acceleration rate as @xmath3 while @xmath8 , following the argumentation for enhanced @xmath0 acceleration rate , is much slower heated . as can be seen from figure  [ fig:4]_c _",
    "the energy available for @xmath8 is much smaller than for @xmath194 .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by carrying out the same simulations for @xmath8 and @xmath194 as for @xmath0 and @xmath3 . although the acceleration via ef waves by cyclotron resonance energizes @xmath8 ions up to energies of @xmath1 on timescales of @xmath195 , an enhancement of @xmath192 by the same mechanism as for @xmath40 presented above can not be reached .",
    "it is in general impossible in the efi model to explain a simultaneous enhancement of @xmath40 and @xmath192 when the spectral energy density exhibits a slope as depicted in figure  [ fig:4]_c_. the same energy is available for @xmath3 and @xmath194 , but @xmath0 has more and @xmath8 has less energy available .",
    "the heating rate of @xmath8 will therefore always lie below the @xmath194 and @xmath3 rate , whereas @xmath0 always lies above it in the present simple model .",
    "other processes may enter the picture .",
    "non - linear effects as the back reaction of the wavefield in response to energy loss to the ions can have a significant influence on the heating rates .",
    "however , the analysis of such effects are beyond the scope of this paper and will not be addressed here .    similar problems arise for the enrichment of ne , mg , si since their gyrofrequencies also lie below the gyrofrequency of @xmath3 .",
    "the same arguments as for @xmath8 therefore make an enhancement above @xmath194 impossible in the present scenario .",
    "the observed heavy ion enrichment is independent of the degree of @xmath0 enhancement , although heavier ion enrichments are generally associated with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is an indication that it may not be the same mechanism that accounts for the acceleration of @xmath0 and @xmath8 or other heavier ions .",
    "a model for the enrichment of @xmath0 during impulsive solar flares is presented .",
    "the acceleration of @xmath0 and @xmath3 can be understood as consequence of electron firehose ( ef ) waves , resulting from an unstable anisotropic electron distribution with @xmath2 .",
    "the model does not need additional sources of free energy or plasma properties than those resulting directly from the acceleration of the bulk of electrons .",
    "the essential result of the investigation is that ef waves , excited by an anisotropic electron distribution function , can accelerate @xmath0 and @xmath3 via cyclotron resonance to @xmath196 energies on timescales of @xmath197 . in support of this conclusion ,",
    "the following specific results are found :    \\1 .",
    "the ef waves accelerate @xmath0 ions via cyclotron resonance .",
    "the symmetry of ef waves in @xmath133 greatly enhances the efficiency of the acceleration process with respect to the standard cyclotron resonant wave - particle interaction of a unidirectional propagating wavefield .",
    "the parallel force driving the ion out of resonance , and therefore limiting the acceleration time in the unidirectional case , cancels out in the time average for the counterpropagating wavefield .",
    "the total resonant interaction time therefore is strongly increased and the particle can reach high energies .",
    "the linear growth of the ef waves self - consistently generates a spectral energy distribution , causing enhanced acceleration of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "it is found from test - particle simulations that the heating rate of @xmath0 exceeds the values for @xmath3 by about a factor of 23 .",
    "it is shown that this small enhancement in the heating rate of @xmath0 above @xmath3 already can account for the observed enhancement in @xmath40 from the coronal value of @xmath198 up to @xmath199 during impulsive solar flares . due to the larger heating rates , the high energy tail of @xmath0 populates energies above @xmath1 faster .",
    "it reaches the required abundance ratio of @xmath40 for an acceleration timescale of @xmath200 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath0 accelerated by the ef waves is large enough to account for the observed particle fluxes . between @xmath201 of the coronal @xmath0 population in the flare",
    "is accelerated above @xmath1 .",
    "the acceleration model reproduces the qualitative behavior of the @xmath0 energy spectrum with respect to the @xmath3 energy spectrum . as observed by @xcite",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is generally harder than the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "moreover , a turnover in the @xmath0 energy spectrum around @xmath44 is obtained , reproducing the observations by @xcite .",
    "ef waves are an inherent property of stochastic electron acceleration by transit - time damping of cascading fast - mode waves .",
    "thus , their ability of accelerating @xmath0 and @xmath3 supports the scenario of stochastic acceleration of the bulk electrons in impulsive flares .",
    "future work will have to extend these results to the oblique ef mode and investigate its role in the enhancement of heavy ions and in the flare acceleration process in general .",
    "the authors thank kjell rnnmark for providing them with a copy of the kgi report describing the original whamp code .",
    "the authors also want to acknowledge grard belmont and laurence rezeau who gave them free access to their improved version of the whamp code , which has become the mathematical core of idlwhamp @xcite ."
