    "the dynamics of systems with general network communications has been an interesting topic of various models and empirical observations @xcite . in networks with large topological dimension defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes within the ( chemical ) distance @xmath2 , the evolution is expected to be exponentially fast .",
    "generic , slow power - law type of dynamics are reported in @xcite . in social and neural networks",
    "the occurrence of generic slow dynamics was suggested to be the result of non - poissonian , bursty behavior of agents @xcite connected by small world networks @xcite .",
    "times between contacts @xcite or communication @xcite between individuals was found to deviate from a poisson process , namely an intermittent switching between periods of low activity and high activity , resulting in fat - tailed inter - communication time distributions @xcite .    on the other hand arbitrarily large , rare - regions ( rr ) , that can change their state exponentially slowly as the function of their sizes can cause so called griffiths phase ( gp ) @xcite , in which slow , non - universal , power - law dynamics occurs @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that gp - s can emerge as the consequence of purely topological disorder . however , this has been found only in finite dimensional networks , or in weighted tree - like networks for an extended time window @xcite .",
    "griffiths singularities affect the dynamical behavior both below and above the transition point and can be best described via renormalization group methods in networks @xcite .",
    "gp - s were shown by optimal fluctuation theory and simulations of the contact process ( cp ) @xcite on erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite and on generalized small world ( gsw ) networks @xcite .",
    "the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model @xcite is another fundamental system to describe simple epidemic ( information ) possessing binary site variables : infected / active or healthy / inactive .",
    "infected sites propagate the epidemic ( or active ) all of their neighbors with rate @xmath3 or recover ( spontaneously deactivate ) with rate @xmath4 .",
    "sis differs from the cp in which the branching rate is normalized by @xmath5 , the number of outgoing edges of a vertex , thus it allows an analytic treatment , using symmetric matrices . by decreasing the infection ( communication ) rate of the neighbors",
    "a continuous phase transition occurs at some @xmath6 critical point from a steady state with finite activity density @xmath7 to an inactive one , with @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is also called absorbing , since no spontaneous activation of sites is allowed .",
    "very recently it has been proposed @xcite that many networks ca nt be considered quenched ones , but evolve on the same time scale as the dynamical process running on top of them .",
    "activity driven network models have been introduced , in which at a given time nodes possess only a small number ( @xmath9 ) of edges selected via a fixed , node - dependent activity potential @xmath10 , which exhibits the probability distribution @xmath11 .",
    "asymptotically the integrated link distribution is shown to be a scale - free ( sf ) network with @xmath12 degree distribution @xcite . in this work",
    "i investigate by extensive numerical simulations if rare - region effects and bursty dynamics could be observed in such networks with cp or annihilating random walk ( arw ) ( see @xcite ) processes running on them .",
    "the @xmath13 critical cp was simulated on rings of size @xmath14 .",
    "the system was started from fully occupied state up to @xmath15 monte carlo steps ( throughout this paper time is measured in mcs and shown to be unit - less on the figures ) .",
    "mcs are built up from full sweeps of active sites . in one elementary mcs",
    "an active site is selected randomly and the activation is removed with probability @xmath16 , alternatively one of its randomly selected neighbor is activated with probability @xmath17 .",
    "the simulations were done around the critical point @xmath18 @xcite of the cp . during the simulations",
    "the times and the inter - communication times ( @xmath19 ) of neighbor activations of sites are calculated and histogrammed .",
    "following the repetition of @xmath20 independent runs these timing data were analyzed and the probability distribution @xmath21 is calculated ( see fig .",
    "[ pticp ] ) .",
    "( color online ) inter - communication time distribution in the 1d critical cp of size @xmath14 .",
    "full line denote histogramming from all times , dashed line from high times , long dashes from low times .",
    "the dotted line shows a power - law fit for @xmath22 resulting in @xmath23 .",
    "the solid thin line corresponds to runs from seed initial conditions .",
    "inset : the same data multiplied by the @xmath24 corresponding to the tail decay.,height=207 ]    the systems during the runs are in non - stationary state , hence the average @xmath19 should increase getting close to extinction , still @xmath21 for finite sizes exhibits a power - law tail , characterized by @xmath25 with the exponent @xmath26 , obtained by least square fitting to the data . to check if the non - stationary would cause a change in @xmath21 the histogramming was performed for the early ( @xmath27 mcs ) and late ( @xmath28 mcs ) events separately .",
    "one can not see any differences , all three @xmath21 distributions exhibit power - law behavior . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath21 distributions above or below @xmath6 show exponential tails as expected .",
    "the scaling behavior at the critical point can be derived by expressing the inter - communication probability via the temporal auto - correlation function .",
    "infection events can happen if there is an infected - uninfected neighbor pair , a kink in the spin language : @xmath29 , at site @xmath30 and time @xmath31 .",
    "using the two - time auto - correlation function @xmath32 one can estimate the probability of the subsequent infection events , separated by a communication - free period @xmath19 as : @xmath33 \\simeq \\gamma(t , s)\\ ] ] using the connected temporal correlator between times @xmath34 and @xmath31 @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes averaging for independent runs . in this estimate",
    "the correlations among the inter - communication time events are neglected , however this does not affect the asymptotic behavior , because terms in the product are @xmath37 .    for 1d cp",
    "it is well known that this function exhibits an ageing behavior ( see @xcite ) , i.e. time translational invariance is broken , but in the @xmath38 limit the densities @xmath39 and the correlator scales as @xmath40 in case of 1d cp @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is also true for the kink variables , which also follow the same universal scaling behavior , belonging to the directed percolation class @xcite . strictly speaking due to the ageing behavior we have the scale dependence @xmath42 and",
    "indeed the simulations confirm this ( see fig .  [ pticp ] ) .",
    "asymptotically one can find the same leading order contribution for @xmath21 , coming from the smallest @xmath34 in the statistical average and the tail behaviors agree with the auto - correlation function decay .",
    "more generally , the site occupancy restriction condition of the cp is not a necessary condition to find fat inter - communication tails .",
    "one can easily deduce , that the power - law tail of @xmath32 of infections causes also fat - tails of the link - activation inter - communication times .",
    "this has been confirmed by the simulations .",
    "furthermore , simulation runs started from small activated seeds ( see @xcite ) resulted in the same tail in @xmath21 again ( see fig .",
    "[ pticp ] ) , only the distribution of activation times changes .",
    "contrary to the full initial condition case , where it decays as @xmath43 it increases as @xmath44 in the case of seeds .",
    "in this section i show results obtained for the cp on certain gsw networks @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these system exhibit extended gp regions , with non - universal , @xmath3 dependent power - law dynamics @xcite .",
    "the network generation starts with @xmath1 nodes on a ring .",
    "all nearest neighbors are connected with euclidean distance @xmath45 with probability @xmath4 and pairs with @xmath46 with a probability @xmath47 . for large distance",
    "this results in @xmath48 .",
    "now i consider the cases : @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "in @xcite i investigated a generalized model , in which fraction of edges of the ageing nodes were removed from the ba graph by a random , linear preferential rule .",

    "not so surprisingly burstyness does not occur in such time varying networks either , because the network rewiring process destroys the long - range dynamical correlations .",
    "simulations result in an exponential tail @xmath21 distributions .",
    "observed burstyness in network systems is assumed to be the related of the internal , non - poissonian behavior of agents or state variables .",
    "this has been explained by different multi - level or time - scheduling internal models . in this paper",
    "i show an alternative route to this , being a natural consequence of correlated , complex behavior of the whole system . in case of the critical ,",
    "one - dimensional contact process fat - tailed inter - communication time distribution arises , related to the diverging auto - correlation function .",
    "furthermore , the addition of long edges , which turns the network to gsws with griffiths phases one can observe topology dependent , fat - tailed inter - communication time distributions .",
    "i have also shown that in case of an ageing scale - free network , exhibiting griffiths phase these power - law distributions depend also on the average connectivity of nodes . the observed tail exponents vary in the range : @xmath114 , which is smaller than the experimental values reported on human communication data - sets @xcite .",
    "however , as the gsw model example shows there exist networks , possessing smaller topological dimensions , where @xmath115 . furthermore , there are other models @xcite , like the bosonic contact process or the bosonic pair contact process , where the auto - correlation decays slower ( @xmath116 for these unrestricted cps @xcite ) , thus @xmath58 could also be smaller on networks .",
    "it is important to note that these systems are in a non - stationary state during the simulations , still the tail distributions are time invariant and initial condition invariant .",
    "usually real systems are also in the non - stationary state as the consequence of various external conditions , circadian oscillations . in case of regular networks the distributions are site invariant as well .",
    "finally i have shown that both the contact process and annihilating random walks exhibit mean - field like dynamics on time varying , scale - free networks gp effects are absent and the distribution of inter - communication times is not bursty , but characterized by an exponential tail distribution .",
    "these results suggest that bursty behavior can emerge as a collective behavior in quenched network systems close to criticality or in extended gp like regions , suggesting a closer inspection of such system .",
    "when real - world data confirms that sites exhibit inherent bursty behavior the superimpose of the two reason should emerge , possibly with the outcome of the more relevant one , which decays slower .",
