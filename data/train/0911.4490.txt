    "the numerical renormalization group method,@xcite originally developed by wilson@xcite for the kondo model , is by now an established technique for the solution of general quantum impurity problems .",
    "it has been applied , e.g. , to magnetic atoms in metals , to quantum dots and magnetic molecules , and as an impurity solver within dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "its generalization@xcite to bosonic baths has enabled the treatment of dissipative impurity models and those with both bosonic and fermionic baths.@xcite quite often , impurity quantum phase transitions@xcite are in the focus of interest .",
    "the strengths of nrg in treating such critical phenomena lie in its ability to treat arbitrarily small energy scales and in its renormalization - group character which allows e.g. for the analysis of flow diagrams .",
    "recently , conflicting results have been reported about the critical behavior of certain impurity models with a bosonic bath , in particular the spin - boson and the ising - symmetric bose - fermi kondo model.@xcite for a bosonic bath with power - law spectral density @xmath0 , these models display a quantum phase transition for @xmath2 .",
    "statistical - mechanics arguments suggest that this transition is in the same universality class as the thermal phase transition of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) ising model with @xmath3 long - range interactions . at issue",
    "is the validity of this quantum - to - classical correspondence for @xmath1 where the ising model is above its upper - critical dimension and displays mean - field behavior.@xcite initially , two of us claimed non - classical behavior with hyperscaling in the spin - boson model for @xmath1 , based primarily on nrg results.@xcite these results have been verified by others,@xcite and extended to the ising - symmetric bose - fermi kondo model.@xcite in contrast , subsequent quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and exact - diagonalization@xcite studies concluded that the critical behavior of the spin - boson model for @xmath1 is classical and of mean - field type .",
    "we have recently retracted the claim@xcite of non - classical behavior , because we have realized two different sources of error of the nrg which spoil the determination of critical exponents.@xcite however , other authors continue to rely on nrg results in this context.@xcite    , as function of temperature @xmath4 and tunneling strength @xmath5 ( keeping the dissipation strength @xmath6 fixed ) , showing a path with @xmath7 ( thick solid ) along which quantum - critical observables should be measured . due to the mass - flow effect ,",
    "a temperature - dependent deviation of the order - parameter mass is induced , such that a system located at @xmath8 at @xmath9 follows a path with finite mass , @xmath10 , at any @xmath11 ( thick dashed ) .",
    "the thin lines represent trajectories with ( dashed ) and without ( solid ) mass - flow effect for @xmath12 .",
    ", width=240 ]    in this paper , we investigate one of the error sources of the nrg in more detail , which we have dubbed the mass - flow effect .",
    "it arises from the nrg algorithm which iteratively integrates out the impurity s bath . for a particle - hole asymmetric bath ,",
    "the real part of the bath propagator generates a physical shift of impurity parameters ; for models with single - particle tunneling between impurity and bath it is simply the energy of the impurity level which is shifted due to the real part of the hybridization function . as a nrg calculation ignores the part of the bath spectrum below the current nrg scale ,",
    "there is , at any nrg step , a _ missing _",
    "parameter shift which is is set by the current nrg scale . near a quantum phase transition",
    ", this implies an artificial scale - dependent shift of the order - parameter mass . for a nrg calculation with model parameter values corresponding to the critical point , the system is therefore _ not _ located at the critical coupling for any finite @xmath4 , but effectively follows a trajectory in the phase diagram as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdflow ] .",
    "this spoils the measurement of critical properties extracted in a nrg run as function of @xmath4 .",
    "other sources of error within the nrg method are the discretization of the continuous bath density of states , the truncation of the eigenvalue spectrum in each nrg step to the lowest @xmath13 states , and the truncation of the bath hilbert space in the case of a bosonic bath , where only @xmath14 states are taken into account .",
    "while the effects of discretization and spectrum truncation are well studied and understood within the fermionic nrg,@xcite hilbert - space truncation is more serious .",
    "ref .   pointed out that it precludes a correct representation of the ordered phase of the spin - boson model for @xmath15 at low energies or temperatures .",
    "later , it was realized@xcite that it also leads to incorrect results for the order - parameter exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the phase transition above the upper - critical dimension . in this paper , our focus will be on the mass - flow effect ; the other errors will be discussed when appropriate .",
    "first , we shall demonstrate the mass - flow effect within a model of non - interacting bosons , namely the dissipative harmonic oscillator , for which all statements can be made exact . in this model",
    ", the critical point translates into the instability point where the renormalized impurity energy is zero .",
    "the mass flow will be shown to lead to qualitatively incorrect results ; this problem carries over to interacting models , like the anharmonic oscillator or the spin - boson model , if the critical point is gaussian ( i.e. above its upper - critical dimension ) .",
    "second , we propose an extension of the iterative diagonalization scheme to cure the mass - flow error .",
    "this extension solves the problem for the full parameter range of the non - interacting harmonic oscillator , while working asymptotically for models of interacting bosons .",
    "third , we apply the extended nrg algorithm to the spin - boson model . for @xmath1 , we find results qualitatively different from those@xcite of the standard nrg implementation : our new results signify a flow towards a gaussian critical fixed point .",
    "while the truncation of the bosonic hilbert space precludes calculations very close to this gaussian fixed point , we can identify a mean - field power law in the impurity susceptibility .",
    "taken together , this shows that  as other methods  also the nrg predicts that the spin - boson model exhibits mean - field behavior for @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that an observation reminiscent of the mass - flow effect has been made in ref .  :",
    "the critical behavior of the classical long - range ising model with @xmath1 was found to change from mean - field - like to hyperscaling - like upon artificially truncating the `` winding '' of the long - range interaction ( i.e. upon violating the periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time ) .",
    "this finding underscores that mean - field critical behavior in the long - range models under consideration can be easily spoiled by algorithmic errors .",
    "note , however , that we disagree with the interpretation regarding the quantum - to - classical correspondence given in ref .  , see below .",

    "the nrg flow is discussed separately for @xmath18 and @xmath1 and compared to the results from standard nrg .",
    "the results are interpreted in terms of a gaussian critical fixed point for @xmath1 .",
    "conclusions close the paper .",
    "various details , including a discussion of the mass - flow effect in fermionic impurity models with particle  hole asymmetry , are relegated to the appendices .",
    "the mass - flow effect can be most easily demonstrated using impurity models of non - interacting particles .",
    "we shall consider the dissipative harmonic oscillator , with the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the bare `` impurity '' oscillator frequency , @xmath21 is a field conjugate to the oscillator position , and the @xmath22 are the frequencies of the bath oscillators .",
    "the bath is completely specified by its propagator at the `` impurity '' location @xmath23 with the spectral density @xmath24    universal properties of impurity phase transitions are determined by the behavior of the low - energy part of the bath spectrum @xmath25 . discarding high - energy details",
    ", the common parametrization is @xmath26 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 characterizes the dissipation strength , and @xmath27 is a cutoff energy .",
    "the value @xmath28 represents the case of ohmic dissipation .",
    "the dissipative oscillator with a power - law bath spectrum is known to become unstable at large dissipation:@xcite the coupling to the bath renormalizes the oscillator frequency @xmath29 downwards , which becomes zero at some @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the behavior of the model is not well - defined for @xmath31 .",
    "the system at large dissipation may be stabilized by adding a local repulsive interaction to @xmath32 .",
    "a symmetry - broken phase can emerge , with `` condensation '' of the @xmath33 bosons .",
    "two possible routes are @xmath34 and @xmath35 the latter , @xmath36 , can be understood as a local @xmath37 impurity . on the other hand , @xmath38 in the limit",
    "@xmath39 becomes equivalent to the standard spin - boson model @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the local impurity states , and @xmath29 is the tunneling rate .",
    "the equivalence is seen by identifying the remaining oscillator states @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath38 with the states @xmath44 . in all three models ( [ dao],[dao2],[sbm ] ) ,",
    "the ordered phase at large dissipation breaks an ising symmetry , @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 , and is associated with a non - zero expectation value @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) .",
    "universality arguments suggest that the critical properties of the phase transitions are identical in the three models and coincide with those of a classical ising chain with @xmath3 interactions .",
    "this quantum - to - classical correspondence trivially holds for @xmath36 in eq .",
    ", as its imaginary - time path integral representation at @xmath9 is identical to the continuum limit of the one - dimensional ising model ( i.e. a scalar @xmath37 theory).@xcite for @xmath1 , the critical behavior is gaussian and mean - field like , with the quartic interaction being dangerously irrelevant at criticality .    the quantum phase transition in the spin - boson model has been extensively studied : while the ohmic case , @xmath28 , has long been known to display a kosterlitz - thouless transition,@xcite the sub - ohmic case has only been investigated more recently.@xcite for @xmath50 , a continuous quantum phase transition emerges , with critical exponents depending on @xmath51 . while there is consensus that , for @xmath52 , those exponents are identical to the ones of the corresponding 1d ising model , a debate is centered around the issue of whether or not this continues to hold for @xmath53 where the ising model displays mean - field behavior .",
    "alternatively , non - mean - field exponents obeying hyperscaling have been proposed on the basis of nrg calculations@xcite , and also carried over to the ising - symmetric bose - fermi kondo model.@xcite in particular , nrg has been used to calculate the local susceptibility @xmath54 at the critical coupling as function of temperature , which was found to follow a power law @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , mean - field behavior implies@xcite @xmath57 , which has indeed been found e.g. using qmc simulations .",

    "typically , this is a reasonable approximation , as the spectral density of the missing part of the chain , @xmath74 , has contributions at energies below @xmath75 only .",

    "this equation shows that the dissipative oscillator is unstable at and beyond the `` resonance '' which occurs at some dissipation strength @xmath30 , defined by @xmath91 . for @xmath92 ,",
    "all eigenenergies of the system are positive , whereas the lowest one turns negative for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 corresponds to a singularity of the dissipative harmonic oscillator , separating the stable from the unstable regime .",

    "[ fig : chi_ho ] where we show the susceptibility as function of temperature , calculated using either a long wilson chain for all @xmath4 or an @xmath63-site wilson chain at temperature @xmath73 , i.e. , using methods ( ii ) and ( iii ) described above .",
    "most importantly , @xmath54 calculated from the truncated wilson chain is temperature - dependent , in contrast to the exact result . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the exact result is approached at low @xmath4 .",

    "the irrelevant interaction @xmath101 leads to an order - parameter mass @xmath102 for @xmath1 , and the physical susceptibility follows @xmath103 ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , the artificial mass @xmath104 caused by the mass - flow effect dominates the physical mass at low @xmath4 , leading again to the unphysical result @xmath97 .",
    "as this coincides with the physical result for an interacting critical fixed point with hyperscaling , the unphysical result from the mass - flow effect could be mistaken as a signature of interacting quantum criticality .",
    "we should emphasize that a renormalization - group scheme which successively integrates out the impurity s bath is perfectly valid .",
    "however , it requires that the calculation of observables at some scale @xmath4 accounts for the remaining part of the bath .",
    "the latter is not the case in the iterative diagonalization scheme of standard nrg .",
    "the mass - flow error arises from the missing real part of the bath propagator , @xmath105 , which , for every step of the iterative diagonalization , is simply a number .",
    "ideally , a general algorithmic solution of the mass - flow problem would directly correct @xmath106 .",
    "however , this is limited by kramer - kronig relations , and we have not found a manageable implementation of this idea .    in the following ,",
    "we shall instead make use of physics arguments in order to ( approximately ) correct the mass - flow error .",
    "for the harmonic oscillator , @xmath106 directly renormalizes the oscillator s energy , while things are conceptually more complicated for interacting models ( like the spin - boson or bose - fermi kondo models ) .",
    "therefore , we shall separately discuss the non - interacting and interacting cases in the following .",
    "a simple recipe can be used to correct the mass - flow error when diagonalizing a finite - length chain corresponding to the harmonic - oscillator @xmath62 .",

    ", @xmath110 has the correct mass term , i.e. , the correct renormalized oscillator frequency , for any @xmath63 , and diagonalizing @xmath110 instead of @xmath62 in step @xmath63 removes the mass - flow problem .",
    "one obtains the correct result for @xmath54 : thanks to @xmath107 , the denominator of @xmath54 in eq .",
    "is replaced by @xmath111 which is the exact result for the semi - infinite wilson chain .      a mass - flow correction via @xmath107",
    "can be straightforwardly implemented into the iterative diagonalization scheme of the nrg method",
    ". the modified nrg algorithm ( dubbed nrg@xmath112 in the following ) works as follows : ( i ) initially , one diagonalizes @xmath113 .",
    "in addition to the usual observables , the matrix elements of the operator @xmath114 are stored as well .",
    "then , the following steps are repeated : ( ii ) from the lowest @xmath13 states of the solution of nrg step @xmath63 and the states of the impurity site @xmath71 , one constructs @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath116 , the operator @xmath115 contains a mass - flow correction from the previous steps .",

    "the correction of the mass - flow error , contained in steps ( i ) and ( iii ) which differ from the usual nrg algorithm , is implemented such that the frequency shifts cancel in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "hence , runs of nrg and nrg@xmath112 with the same model parameters should target the same point in the phase diagram as @xmath120 ( although their finite - temperature trajectories are different , fig .  [ fig : pdflow ] ) .",
    "however , this is only true in the absence of spectrum truncation . for finite @xmath13 ,",
    "the cancellation is only approximate , i.e. , there will be a small ( but unimportant ) parameter shift due to the mass - flow correction .",
    "being interested in extracting critical properties , we identify the mass - flow effect as a scale - dependent shift of the order - parameter mass .",
    "this suggests that the mass flow can be corrected by an appropriate shift in the phase transition s control parameter  this is simply a generalization of eq .   where @xmath107 shifts the oscillator frequency .",
    "we thus propose to employ a correction of the form @xmath121 where @xmath117 is now a ( local ) operator which can be used to tune the phase transition , e.g. , the tunneling term @xmath122 in the spin - boson model or the kondo coupling term in a bose - fermi kondo model .",
    "importantly , the required shift will no longer be identical to @xmath123 .",
    "this is already clear for the dissipative anharmonic oscillators , eqs .   and , where the quartic interaction will renormalize both the oscillator frequency and also its shift due to the bath , but in a different fashion .",
    "hence , we have introduced the non - universal prefactor @xmath124 which we intend to determine by physical criteria .",
    "two issues require special consideration : ( a ) is the linear relation between the required shift in the control parameter and the missing real part of @xmath125 , which is implied by eq .",
    ", justified ? ( b ) how can one determine the prefactor @xmath124 ?    the simplest argument for ( a ) is as follows : the phase transition s control parameter ( equivalently , the distance to criticality or the bare order - parameter mass ) depends on both the prefactor of @xmath117 and the real part of @xmath126 .",
    "both dependencies have a regular taylor expansion at a given point in parameter space , hence , the leading terms are linear . as @xmath127 changes by a known amount in every step of the iterative diagonalization due to the mass - flow effect , this can be compensated by a change in the prefactor of @xmath117 which proportional to this amount , i.e. , a change of the form @xmath128 with some fixed @xmath124 .",
    "this argument only relies on the taylor expansion and is thus asymptotically correct for small changes in @xmath127 , i.e. , for @xmath129 .",
    "( for a given model , like the anharmonic oscillator , one can check the linear behavior by an explicit perturbative calculation . )",
    "physically , it is clear that the linear term of the expansion will capture the correct behavior in the vicinity of a given renormalization - group fixed point , i.e. , the required @xmath124 depends on the fixed point of interest ( and on non - universal high - energy details ) .",
    "note , however , that the procedure is more general than these considerations suggest : as both the gaussian critical fixed point and the delocalized fixed point are asymptotically non - interacting , a fixed @xmath124 can be used to capture the entire crossover from the quantum critical to the delocalized regime in this case .",
    "question ( b ) will be discussed for different types of critical fixed points in turn .",
    "we shall use the language of the dissipative anharmonic oscillator , where the critical theory is known.@xcite      a gaussian critical fixed point , realized for @xmath1 , provides a simple criterion to find the correct value @xmath130 of the correction parameter @xmath124 , namely the temperature dependence of the order parameter mass . as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec : dho ] , the artificial mass generated by the mass - flow effect follows @xmath131 , while the physical mass scales as @xmath132 .",

    "for @xmath135 ( undercompensation ) , the positive @xmath131 term will always dominate at low @xmath4 and mimic hyperscaling properties . for @xmath136 ( overcompensation ) , the mass will become negative at low @xmath4 , i.e. , the flow will be towards the localized phase .",
    "an intermediate flow inside the localized phase will even occur if couplings are chosen to be slightly in the delocalized phase : for @xmath137 or @xmath138 the system flows from critical to localized and then back to delocalized upon lowering @xmath4 , accompanied by a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath54 .",
