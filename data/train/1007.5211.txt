    "in a previous note @xcite we have obtained a solution of the lamb integral equation @xcite using a formalism based on the fractional derivatives .",
    "our result coincides with the solution provided , without any proof , by bateman @xcite .",
    "a generalization of our method has been proposed in @xcite , where fractional derivatives are used to solve a more complicated version of the lamb equation .    in this note",
    "we discuss a further extension of the technique put forward in @xcite and we will develop a more general procedure to treat integral equations whose solution requires fractional forms of differential operators other than the ordinary derivative . to this aim we remind that the exponential operator @xmath0 is a dilatation operator whose action on a given function @xmath1 is ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath2    let us now consider the operator @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the use of the following property of the laplace transform @xmath5 allows to write @xmath6 and , according to the previous discussion , we find @xcite @xmath7 which is essentially the generalization of the riemann - liouville integral representation for non - integer negative powers of the operator @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] can be generalized to other differential forms .",
    "the first example we consider is the following modified form of the lamb - bateman equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the function to be determined , and @xmath11 is a continuous , free from singularities , known function .",
    "according to the properties of the dilatation operator , we can cast eq . in the form @xmath12 and , treating the derivative operator as a generic constant , the evaluation of the the gaussian integral yields @xmath13 by rewriting the operator @xmath14 as @xmath15 , and taking into account eq .",

    ". has been checked numerically .    as a further example of integral equation which does not involve fractional operators but requires the use of the dilatation operator , we consider the following problem @xmath19 where @xmath10 is the unknown function . in this case",
    "we get @xmath20 and , thus @xmath21    in the case @xmath22 , we obtain the solution in terms of 0-th order bessel functions of first kind , namely we obtain the following identity @xmath23 . ] @xmath24 in general , if @xmath11 is any function which can be expanded as @xmath25 the solution writes @xmath26 it is interesting to note that in the case in which the equation is of the type @xmath27 the relevant solution can be written in terms of bessel - like functions as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bessel - wright function of order @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the same result holds for the integer @xmath31 replaced by any real @xmath32 .",
    "we go back to fractional operational calculus by considering the following example of integral equation @xmath33 which is apparently more complicated than the original lamb - bateman equation , but , as will be shown later , in spite of its different form , it represents the same mathematical problem .",
    "also in this case the solution can be obtained using the previously outlined shift operator technique .",
    "we first recall the identity @xcite @xmath34 and therefore , as a straightforward consequence of our procedure , we find @xmath35 the use of the same logical steps leading to eq .",
    "yields the following expression for the solution of eq . @xmath36",
    "the examples discussed so far show that the method we have proposed is fairly powerful and is amenable of useful generalizations . a further example supporting the usefulness of our technique",

    "the behavior of the functions @xmath45 for different values of @xmath46 is shown in fig . [ fig : funs ] .",
