    "quantum nonlocality is generally interpreted as the ability of quantum theory to explain correlations arising due to local measurements on space - like separated systems beyond the scope of local realism . since its origin from bell s theorem @xcite , it has been the cynosure of significant research activity .",
    "entanglement @xcite marks another significant departure of quantum mechanics from its classical counterpart .",
    "although inequivalent in concept , nonlocality and entanglement has proved themselves to be pertinent resources in various tasks like teleportation @xcite , randomness certification @xcite , cryptography @xcite . while entanglement refers to inseparability of subsystems ,",
    "bell - nonlocality is interpreted as the strongest form of quantum nonlocality .",
    "bell - nonlocality is detected through the violation of a suitable bell inequality , one such important inequality being the chsh inequality@xcite , which itself is necessary and sufficient under two measurement settings . a state which satisfies the bell - chsh inequality",
    "can not be considered _",
    "local _ , as there can be other bell inequalities that it violates . however , violation of the bell - chsh inequality is a signature of nonlocality .",
    "a state is termed as _",
    ", only if it admits a local hidden variable model(lhv ) @xcite .",
    "the correlations exhibited by a state admitting a lhv can be simulated by separable states .",
    "the inequivalence of entanglement and nonlocality is exemplified by the existence of entangled states admitting a lhv @xcite .",
    "+ the underlying foundational and pragmatic significance of nonlocality has motivated research towards revealing nonlocality@xcite , local filtering operation being one such procedure @xcite . the procedures to reveal hidden nonlocality",
    "can be broadly classified into two categories ( i ) performing single local measurement @xcite and ( ii ) subjecting the state to suitable sequence of local measurements @xcite .",
    "there has been extensive research in both the directions , the main motivation being extraction of nonlocal behaviour from quantum states which failed to generate the same under the standard bell scenario .",
    "recently , the effect of global unitary operations on the nonlocality of a state has been probed by some of us @xcite , with the focus being on the bell - chsh inequality for two qubit systems . precisely , a state which initially satisfies the bell - chsh inequality can violate it when subjected to a global unitary action . on the other hand",
    ", there are states which preserve their bell - chsh local character under global unitary effect , subsequently termed as _ absolutely bell - chsh local _ states @xcite . for a given spectrum ,",
    "the maximal bell - chsh violation is attained at the respective bell - diagonal state@xcite .",
    "therefore , if a bell - diagonal state is bell - chsh local , it is absolutely bell - chsh local@xcite .",
    "hence , a quantum state with spectrum @xmath0(in decreasing order ) is termed as absolutely bell - chsh local iff @xcite , @xmath1 this feature bears resemblance to a similar problem in entanglement , where there are states which preserve separability under global unitary action on the composite system@xcite .",
    "such states are termed as absolutely separable .",
    "+ on a different note , a state may lose its nonlocality if it is subjected to environmental interaction , a situation one can not dispense within practical scenarios@xcite .",
    "recent studies on nonlocality breaking maps have been indicative of the probable drastic effects@xcite . in this context , one pertinent question is whether one can regenerate nonlocality .",
    "the question assumes significance if one can retrieve nonlocality even from absolutely bell - chsh local states .",
    "+ given the practical and foundational significance of nonlocality , a quantum state capable of exhibiting the trait can be considered to be a resource.now if nonlocality of any entangled state does not appear by using existing procedures of detection , the state may seem useless in spite of being entangled .",
    "hence from a resource theoretic perspective , it becomes important to generate nonlocality from such useless entangled states . in recent times",
    "there has been many studies attempting to exhibit nonlocal features of entangled quantum states which are thought to be devoid of any capability to generate nonlocal correlations in standard bell sense @xcite .",
    "+ our present work is motivated by the aforementioned questions . to state",
    "precisely , we find that an amplitude damping channel , a typical representative of environmental interaction , can have fatal effects on the nonlocality of a state . the state can be even turned into an absolutely bell - chsh local state . however , through appropriate sequential measurements one can transform the state to a state which is no longer absolutely bell - chsh local .",
    "one can then generate nonlocality from the transformed state through a suitable global unitary .",
    "the protocol relies on the slocc(stochastic local operation and classical communication ) used in the standard entanglement swapping procedure @xcite .",
    "we have chosen as input the x class of states @xcite , which contains within it several significant subclasses of quantum states .",
    "our protocol is further underscored by existence of absolutely bell - chsh local states admitting a lhv model which can be converted to a state which is no longer absolutely bell - chsh local .",
    "+ we have organized the remaining work as follows : in the following section we observe the influence of an amplitude damping channel on the werner class of states . in sec.[cs1 ] we introduce the protocol and prescribe measures to retrieve nonlocality .",
    "we also probe the generation of nonlocality from well - known class of states in sec.[cs2 ] .",
    "we finally conclude in sec.[concl ] .",
    "in this section we give an intuitive insight of our protocol and its possible applications before presenting the main prescription in the following section .",
    "consider the werner class of states @xcite : @xmath2.\\ ] ] after being passed through an amplitude damping channel(characterized by noise parameter @xmath3,say)@xcite , the transformed state is given by :    @xmath4     where @xmath5 and @xmath3 characterizes the werner state and amplitude damping channel respectively .",
    "a werner state corresponding to any point say @xmath6 in this restricted area loses its nonlocal character when passed through an amplitude damping channel parametrized by noise parameter @xmath3 corresponding to the point @xmath7 the extent of damping is such that its nonlocal behavior can not be extracted even by applying optimal global unitary operations.__,width=144 ]    the nonlocal states from werner class after passing through amplitude damping channel become absolutely bell - chsh local , i.e. , nonlocal character of the damped states can not be retrieved even under global unitary operations(see fig.([amplitude1 ] ) ) .",
    "however when such states are used in our protocol then nonlocal character of some of them can be retrieved probabilistically in the measurement phase of the protocol when suitable global unitary operations are applied on the states resulting due to bob s joint measurement(see fig.([amplitude2 ] ) ) .     or @xmath8 ) from absolutely bell - chsh local werner states resulting from amplitude damping channel parametrized by @xmath3 lying in the shaded region.__,width=144 ]    the parameter range for the transformation and subsequent retrieval",
    "is given below : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        axis represents revelation of non absolute local states at the end of our protocol(measurement phase ) .",
    "intercepted length @xmath9 of the @xmath10 axis gives the restriction over the state parameter @xmath10 for which generation of nonlocality with some non zero probability is obtained starting from absolutely bell - chsh local states having lhv model(upto projective measurements).__,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] [ 2 ]    one should note that in each of the above demonstrations , the swapping protocol converts a state into a state which is not absolutely bell - chsh local .",
    "a suitable global unitary needs to be applied on the resultant state to generate nonlocality as already mentioned in the description of our protocol in sec .",
    "bell nonlocality occupies a paramount position in the foundational aspects of quantum theory .",
    "it is a significant ingredient in various quantum information processing tasks .",
    "however , in practical scenarios such resource can be destroyed due to environmental influence . + nonlocality can be destroyed through environmental interactions . a pertinent question is then related to finding measures to retrieve nonlocality",
    "this question motivates our present work . in this work ,",
    "we have come across a situation where the drastic effect of environment(in the form of a amplitude damping channel ) can lead a nonlocal state to be absolutely bell - chsh local .",
    "absolutely bell - chsh local states are precisely those from which nonlocality can not be generated even by using global unitary operations .",
    "our work here proposes a prescription through which one can retrieve nonlocality .",
    "the prescription relies on the entanglement swapping protocol . using the proposal one can turn a state which is absolutely bell - chsh local to a state which is no longer absolutely bell - chsh local .",
    "one can then use a global unitary operation on the resultant state to generate nonlocality .",
    "the x class of states , which contains within it several important classes of states like the werner and gisin states , have been taken as the input in our protocol .",
    "we have shown successfully that nonlocality can be generated from otherwise seemingly useless states(in terms of nonlocality ) .",
    "+ the present work leads to useful directions of future research .",
    "we have investigated the effect of nonlocality breaking channels and the subsequent retrieval of nonlocality in the purview of the bell - chsh inequality in two qubits .",
    "extensions of the work to other bell inequalities in two qubits can be interesting .",
    "the scenario in multiqubit systems can also turn to be a significant enquiry .",
