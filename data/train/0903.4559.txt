    "currently there are @xmath7 known galaxy - scale lenses , divided roughly equally in number into lensed active galactic nuclei and lensed background galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxy - scale lenses allow diverse applications ( see the review `` strong gravitational lensing '' by kochanek in @xcite ) such as a determination of the hubble constant , a characterisation of galaxy evolution , and measurements of the mass distribution in galaxies . the last application will likely be the most important one in the next decade , since there are few other probes at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it was noticed quite early on that the flux ratios of the multi - lensed images are more difficult to reproduce with simple parametric mass models than the image positions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has been termed the `` anomalous flux ratio '' problem .",
    "image positions and magnifications ( flux ratios ) are determined by the first - order and second - order derivatives of the lensing potential , respectively .",
    "therefore flux ratios , as a high - order derivative , are expected to be more sensitive to small changes in the lensing potential than image positions .    in this",
    "regard , gravitational lenses with two or three close images deserve special attention because , in these cases , the sources must be close to either a fold or a cusp of the caustic .",
    "it is well known for any smooth lensing potential that the close images follow _ asymptotic _ flux ratio relations : for a close pair , their flux ratio approaches unity when their separation goes to zero , while for a close triple , the ratio of the flux of the middle image to the sum of the fluxes of the two outer images asymptotically goes to unity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observed lensing systems often violate these asymptotic relations .",
    "this was taken to be evidence for substructure in lensing galaxies ( @xcite ) on the physical scale of the separation between close images ( typically of the order of @xmath9 1 kpc ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations go beyond simple broad - band flux ratios and provide a promising way to probe substructure in lenses ( @xcite ) .",
    "other suggestive evidence for substructures comes from astrometry ( see @xcite for a general discussion ) , such as bent jets ( @xcite ) , and detailed image structures for b2016 + 112 ( @xcite ) and b0128 + 437 ( @xcite ) .",
    "substructures may also have detectable effects on the time delays in gravitational lenses ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that some of these lensing `` anomalies '' may be accommodated by changes in the potentials of the main lensing galaxies in parametric models .",
    "however , significant changes are needed in order to explain the anomalies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular structures of the lenses whenever the measurements are available suggest ellipsoidal central potentials , where the high amplitude , higher order multipoles that are required to explain the flux ratio anomalies are not seen ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are strong hints that substructures may indeed be real in lensing galaxies .",
    "first , observationally , saddle ( negative - parity ) images are often fainter than the predictions of simple smooth models .",
    "this is expected from lensing by substructure ( such as stars , or subhaloes ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but impossible to explain by propagation effects , such as galactic scintillation and scatter broadening , as earlier postulated ( @xcite ) .",
    "this arguably constitutes the most convincing evidence for substructure lensing .",
    "second , in many gravitational lenses , the substructure is directly seen as luminous satellites . for example ,",
    "nearly half of the class lenses ( @xcite ) show luminous satellite galaxies within a few kpc of the primary lensing galaxies higher than that claimed in @xcite as revealed by a more careful analysis of hst images of the class lenses ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "inclusion of satellites in the modelling dramatically improves the fit to the image positions . in the case of b2045 + 265",
    ", the inclusion of a companion galaxy helps to explain the flux ratio anomaly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the additional dark subhaloes within the main lensing galaxies , as well as the intergalactic perturbers along the line - of - sight ( @xcitea , b ; @xcite ) may also help to explain the observed lensing anomalies .",
    "much of the interest in ( milli-)lensing flux anomalies arises because they may be caused by the elusive substructure generically predicted by the hierarchical structure formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology ( e.g. @xcitea , b ; @xcite ) . in this model , large structures form via merging and accretion of smaller structures .",
    "the cores of these small structures often survive tidal destruction and manifest themselves as subhaloes ( substructure ) .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations predict many thousands of subhaloes ( down to @xmath10 , or to circular velocity of @xmath11 ; e.g. @xcite ) , at least two orders of magnitude more than the number of observed satellite galaxies in the milky way , even after accounting for the newly discovered faint satellite galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible solution is that star formation may be strongly suppressed in the vast majority of the low - mass subhaloes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and thus they remain dark and difficult to detect through light - based methods .",
    "if this is the case , then gravitational lensing can potentially probe this population since it depends only on the mass but not on whether the lenses are luminous or dark .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that subhaloes typically account for 5 - 10 per cent of the total mass in a galaxy - type halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the study by @xcite requires @xmath12 0.6% to 7% ( with a median of 2% ) of the mass to be in substructures ( 90% confidence limit ) in order to explain the observed flux anomaly problem . at first sight",
    ", the fraction of substructure from simulations seems to be more than sufficient to explain the flux anomaly . upon closer examination ,",
    "however , a problem emerges : lensing probes the central few kpc around the line - of - sight through the galaxy , while most substructures are in the outer regions of its dark matter halo , since those that come close to the centre are tidally destroyed .",
    "thus it remains unclear whether the predicted substructure in the inner regions is sufficient or not to explain the observed flux anomalies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , on cluster scales , the amount of predicted substructure seems to be consistent with weak and strong lensing data ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous lensing studies simulated galaxy - sized haloes with @xmath13 particles so that subhaloes were resolved down to @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "state - of - the - art simulations can now resolve haloes with two or even three orders of magnitude more particles , thus reaching substantially lower mass subhaloes . in this work",
    ", we revisit the issue of substructure lensing using the aquarius simulations of six galaxy - sized haloes .",
    "these collisionless @xmath16-body simulations were performed by the virgo consortium in a concordance @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "the subhaloes in each halo are resolved down to masses of @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , at least two orders of magnitude better than that in previous substructure lensing studies .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we describe the realisation and the properties of the simulated lensing galaxies .",
    "our methods and techniques for the lensing simulations together with our test results are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we apply our lensing simulation to the six simulated galaxy haloes from the aquarius simulation to derive their lensing properties , including the cusp relations , and we compare the numerical results with observations .",
    "a summary of the paper and a discussion are given in section 5 .",
    "the cosmology we adopt for the lensing simulation is the same as that used for the aquarius simulations ( @xcite ) , with a matter density @xmath18 = 0.25 , cosmological constant @xmath19 = 0.75 , hubble constant @xmath20 and linear fluctuation amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "in this section , we summarise the properties of dark matter haloes from the aquarius simulations relevant to our study , in particular the subhalo properties .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "we will show that dark matter alone is , as expected , insufficient to cause multiple image splittings , and therefore we must incorporate a stellar component ; we detail such a procedure in  [ sec : insertbaryon ] .",
    "the aquarius project ( @xcite ) is a suite of simulations of six galaxy - sized dark matter haloes with five levels of numerical resolution .",
    "the haloes were selected from a 100@xmath22 mpc simulation box within the concordance cosmology ( for parameters see above ) .",
    "the simulations were run with gadget-3 , an improved version of the gadget-2 code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the highest resolution level ( level 1 ) was achieved for only one halo ( `` _ aq - a-1 _ '' ) with @xmath23 billion halo particles .",
    "level-2 simulations were performed for a sample of six dark matter haloes , with about 200 million particles per halo .",
    "the softening length is @xmath90.05@xmath22 kpc , and the mass resolution ranges from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "all haloes are milky - way type systems in terms of their mass and rotation curve .",
    "we will use the six level-2 haloes ( _ aq - a-2 _ , _ aq - b-2 _ , _ aq - c-2 _ , _ aq - d-2 _ , _ aq - e-2 _ and _ aq - f-2 _ ) at redshift zero for our analysis of substructure lensing . as we will show later on ,",
    "the scatter in lensing properties among different haloes ( and for different projections ) is large , and so it is important to examine more than one halo for statistical purposes .",
    "the basic properties of the six haloes at @xmath26 are listed in table [ tab : aquarius_simulations ] . in particular , all the density profiles are reasonably fit by navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profiles ( @xcite ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius within which the mean dark halo mass density is 200 times the critical density , @xmath29 is the mass enclosed within @xmath28 , and @xmath30 is the concentration parameter with @xmath31 being the scale radius .        + note : cols ( 2 - 4 ) : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the einstein radius , axis ratio and core radius of the fitted isothermal ellipsoid ( see eq .",
