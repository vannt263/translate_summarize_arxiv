    "p + p _ q - v(q)_p , p , q ^n .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of an observable @xmath5 under the hamiltonian dynamic for the energy @xmath6 , perturbed by friction and noise :    dp = -v(q ) dt -p dt + dw(t),dq = pdt .    the relation between and is given by the fact that the function @xmath7 satisfies the partial differential equation , provided that the pair @xmath8 solves .",
    "it can easily be checked by inspection that if @xmath9 is sufficiently smooth and coercive , the measure @xmath10 is invariant under this dynamic in the sense that if @xmath11 satisfies , then @xmath12 does not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "this can be rephrased as saying that if @xmath14 is a random variable with law @xmath15 independent of the driving noise @xmath16 , then the law of @xmath17 is given by @xmath15 for all times .",

    "@xcite    _ v = - _ q + |v(q)|^2 - ( v)(q ) .",
    "in particular , it was conjectured by helffer and nier ( * ? ? ? * conjecture  1.2 ) that @xmath18 has compact resolvent on @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 has compact resolvent on the _ flat _ space @xmath22 .",
    "this conjecture has been partially solved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the sense that one can exhibit a large class of potentials for which it holds ( loosely , @xmath9 should grow in a sufficiently regular way at infinity ) .",
    "recently , upper as well as lower bounds on the spectral gap of @xmath18 have been obtained in @xcite for potentials @xmath9 that satisfy certain growth conditions at infinity .",
    "all of the results cited above make heavy use of the following two key facts :    there is an explicit formula for the invariant measure of .",
    "the friction term @xmath23 acts on all ( physical ) degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "both of these facts are violated in the following very popular model for heat conduction .",
    "take a finite collection of @xmath24 anharmonic oscillators with nearest - neighbor couplings , that is a classical hamiltonian system with hamiltonian given by    h(p , q ) = _ i=0^n ( p_i^2 2 + v_1(q_i ) ) + _",

    "in particular , as we will see immediately , even the _ existence _ of an invariant probability measure is an open problem in some cases as simple as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this model has been the subject of many studies , both from a numerical and from a theoretical perspective .",
    "the purely harmonic case has been solved explicitly in @xcite .",
    "though no explicit solution is known in the anharmonic case , a wealth of numerical experiments exist , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "since we will mainly focus on the theoretical aspects of the model , we refer to @xcite , which seems to be one of the first rigorous studies of the anharmonic case .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath41 and @xmath42 behave approximately like @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively at infinity then , provided that @xmath45 , there exists a unique invariant measure for .",
    "the statement that was proved was actually stronger than that , namely it was shown that the generator @xmath18 of has compact resolvent in every space of the form @xmath46 with @xmath47 . in @xcite , it was also shown , using entirely probabilistic rather than functional - analytic techniques , that the condition @xmath48 is sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of an invariant measure for .",
    "furthermore , the compactness of the corresponding semigroup in some weighted @xmath49 space was also proved there .",
    "this left open the case @xmath50 which is the subject of the present study .",
    "to our knowledge , no previous rigorous results exist in this case , although some interesting theory has been developed recently in @xcite . at first sight",
    ", one might think that there is no _ a priori _ reason for the behavior of to differ in any essential way from the case @xmath51 where spectral gap results are known .",
    "such wishful thinking turns out to be overly optimistic . even in the simplest possible scenario , that is when",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 , we will show in theorem  [ theo : threeosc ] below that the compactness property of the resolvent of @xmath18 is destroyed as soon as @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath53 , it will be shown in theorem  [ theo : compactchain ] that the essential spectrum of @xmath18 ( always in a weighted @xmath54 space of the type considered before ) extends all the way to @xmath34 .",
    "these negative results hold even in the case where @xmath36 , showing that having the friction acting on all physical degrees of freedom is a crucial assumption for the helffer - nier conjecture to hold .",
    "the reason why the behavior of changes so drastically when @xmath50 can be understood heuristically by the appearance of _ breathers _ ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "breathers are dynamically stable , spatially localized , periodic orbits that arise in the noise - free translation invariant ( @xmath55 ) version of .",
    "good approximations to these orbits persist in , especially if @xmath35 is large .",
    "it is therefore possible to put the system into a state where most of its energy is localized in a few oscillators located in the middle of the chain .",
    "on the other hand , energy can be dissipated only through the terms @xmath56 appearing in the equations for the first and the last oscillator .",
    "therefore , one expects the energy of the system to decay extremely slowly .",
    "the appearance of breathers can be proved in the case where the strength of the nearest - neighbor coupling is much weaker than the strength of the pinning potential . at high energies ,",
    "this is precisely the case when @xmath50 .",
    "this discussion shows that even the mere _ existence _ of an invariant measure is a non - trivial problem in this model unless @xmath57 , in which case one can check explicitly that the usual boltzmann - gibbs distribution is invariant .",
    "this differs from many other systems in that the _ existence _ of an invariant measure , not its _ uniqueness _",
    ", is difficult .",
    "in fact , the uniqueness of an invariant measure for a chain of arbitrary length follows quickly from the hypoellipticity of the generator and the hamiltonian structure once the existence of an invariant measure is established .",
    "we are at the moment unable to provide a general proof that shows the existence of an invariant measure for a chain of arbitrary length . however , in the case of a chain comprising of @xmath58 oscillators , we show in theorem  [ theo : wholething ] below that there exists a unique invariant measure , provided that the coupling potential is harmonic and the pinning potential is homogeneous of sufficiently high degree .",
    "this result is proven by first obtaining an effective dynamics when most of the energy is concentrated in the central oscillator .",
    "this effective dynamics is then used to construct a lyapunov function whose level sets are compact and hence , by a variation on the classical kryloff - bogoliouboff method , implies the existence of an invariant measure .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formalcalc ] , we give a formal calculation that shows how it is possible to relate the spectral properties of @xmath18 to the scaling properties of the potentials @xmath26 and @xmath25 . the results given by these formal calculations are then compared to numerical simulations .",
    "we proceed in section  [ sec : negative ] to the proof of the _ negative _ results concerning the lack of compactness and/or of a spectral gap for @xmath18 . in section  [ sec : effective ] we derive effective equations of motion for the system of three oscillators in the regime when a breather is present . here , we make heavy use of the compensator techniques from averaging / homogenization theory @xcite .",
    "finally , we show in section  [ sec : existence ] that in the simplest case of a chain of three oscillators with harmonic coupling potentials , one can show the existence of an invariant measure for any degree of homogeneity greater than @xmath59 for the pinning potential .",
    "perhaps more interesting then this last result is the method of proof .",
    "we derive as system of effective equations and prove their accuracy that when the energy of middle oscillator is large .",
    "these effective equations give insight into the mechanism of energy dissipation and are used to construct a lyapunov function .",

    "in this section , we first perform a formal calculation that allows us to get a feeling of the speed at which energy is extracted from such a system .",
    "consider the simplest non - trivial case , that is when @xmath60 . in order to keep things simple",
    ", we furthermore assume that the coupling potential @xmath25 is quadratic : @xmath61 and that the pinning potential is homogeneous of degree @xmath62 : @xmath63 for some real number @xmath2 .",
    "the equations of motion for the system of interest are thus given by    dp_0 & = - _ 0 p_0dt - q_0 |q_0|^2k-2dt - ( q_0 - q_1)dt + dw_0 + dp_1 & = - q_1 |q_1|^2k-2dt - ( 2q_1 - q_0 - q_2)dt + dp_2 & = - _ 2 p_2dt - q_2 |q_2|^2k-2dt - ( q_2 - q_1)dt + dw_2 + dq_j & = p_jdt .",
    "let us first have a look at the motion of the middle oscillator by itself , at the solution of    dp = -q |q|^2k-2dt , dq= pdt .",
    "it is easy to see that this equation is invariant under the substitution    q(t ) = e^12k q(e^t),p(t ) = e^1 2 p(e^t ) ,    with @xmath64 .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath65 the solution to with initial condition @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 as given by is the ( unique up to a phase ) solution to at energy @xmath68 .",
    "since the variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 are assumed to be one - dimensional , the solution @xmath65 is periodic , say with period @xmath71 .",
    "consider now the equation for the left oscillator , into which we substitute the ( approximate ) solution to the motion of the middle oscillator that we just found :    dp_0 & = - _ 0 p_0dt - q_0 |q_0|^2k-2dt + q_0dt + dw_0 + e^12kq(e^t)dt + dq_0 & = p_0dt [ e : firstosc ] .",
    "if @xmath68 is large compared to the typical size of @xmath72 we expect that , up to lower order corrections , the solution to this equation behaves like the superposition of the solution @xmath73 to with the exogenous forcing @xmath74 and of a highly oscillatory term of the form    p_0 = e^12k - p(e^t),p = q.    by symmetry , the same applies to the right oscillator @xmath75 .",
    "applying now it s formula to the total hamiltonian @xmath38 for yields    d dt h(t ) = ( _ 0 t_0 + _ 2 t_2 - _ 0 p_0 ^ 2(t ) - _ 2 p_2 ^ 2(t ) ) .    in light of the above discussion , we take @xmath76 for @xmath77 so @xmath78 . from its definition , observe that @xmath79 as @xmath80 for @xmath77 . furthermore ,",
    "when the energy @xmath68 of the middle oscillator is large , we expect the product @xmath81 to average out to a small quantity when integrated over time periods much larger than @xmath82 due to the highly oscillating , mean zero @xmath83 . applying this line of reasoning to shows that , in the regime where most of the energy of the system is concentrated in the middle oscillator , one expects to have    d dt h(t ) - ( _ 0 p_0 ^ 2 + _ 2 p_2 ^ 2 ) - ( _ 0 + _ 2 ) _ k h(t)^2k - 1 ,    where @xmath84 is the variance of the function @xmath85 introduced in , that is    _ k = 1_0^p^2(s)ds - 1 ^ 2 ( _ 0^p(s)ds)^2,p(t ) = q(t ) .    the dependence on @xmath86 comes from the fact that @xmath87 is the position of the free oscillator with potential @xmath88 . actually , one expects this behavior to be correct even in a chain with more than just three oscillators .",
    "if the chain has @xmath89 oscillators and most of the energy is stored in the middle oscillator , one expects the motion of the endpoints to be given by the superposition of a _ slow _ motion and a highly oscillatory _ fast _ motion @xmath90 with a scaling of the type    p_0 = e^12k - ( 2n-1 ) p(e^t ) ,    where @xmath91 is the ( unique ) periodic function such that @xmath92 and such that the integral of @xmath91 over one period vanishes .",
    "( this is because we assume that the nearest - neighbor couplings are linear . )",
    "this suggests that in the general case of a chain of length @xmath89 , the energy of the system decreases like    d dt h(t ) - ( _ 0 + _ n ) _ k , n h(t)^2nk + 1 - 2n ,    for @xmath93 the variance of @xmath91 ( of course , @xmath94 as defined above )",
    ". if @xmath95 is even , the worst - case scenario is obtained by storing most of the energy in one of the two middle oscillators .",
    "since their distance to the boundary is the same as the distance of the middle oscillator to the boundary in the chain of length @xmath96 , we expect the rate of decay of the energy to be similar in both cases .",
    "if the coupling potential is not quadratic but homogeneous of degree @xmath97 , one can still perform a calculation similar to the one we just did , but one has to be more careful .",
    "when looking at the influence of @xmath98 on @xmath99 say , one should take into account whether the fast oscillations of @xmath98 are of order smaller or larger than @xmath31 .",
    "if they are of order smaller than one , one can linearize the coupling potential .",
    "if they are or order larger than one , one should multiply them by the scaling exponent arising in the coupling .",
    "suppose as before that the chain contains @xmath89 oscillators and that most of it s energy is stored in the middle oscillator ( oscillator @xmath100 ) .",
    "assume that the amplitudes in the fast oscillations of @xmath101 and @xmath98 scale like @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "( recall that @xmath104 is the exponent giving the period of the oscillations . )",
    "one then has @xmath105 .",
    "the values of @xmath106 with @xmath107 are given by the following recursion formula :    _ i = \\",
    "{    rl ( 2 - 1)(_i+1 - ) - & + _ i+1 - 2 &    .    using this formula ,",
    "one can then compute @xmath108 . note that if @xmath109 , one obtains @xmath110 which agrees with the value for @xmath111 obtained previously .",
    "one would expect these scaling relations to hold at high energies , even if the potentials are not exactly homogeneous .",
    "one can then still perform most of the analysis presented below by splitting the right - hand side of the equations into a homogeneous part and a remainder term and by assuming that the remainder gets small ( in a suitable sense ) at high energies .      in this section ,",
    "we show that there is a surprisingly good agreement , even over extremely long time intervals , between numerical simulations of and the predictions and . in order to compare the two",
    ", we introduce the function    h^(k , n)(p , q ) = h^(p , q),= 2n ( 1 - 1 k ) .    plugging this into",
    ", we get the prediction    h^(k , n)(t ) h^(k , n)(0 ) - ( _ 0 + _",
    "2)n(2- ) _ k , n .",
    "a straightforward numerical simulation ( essentially integration of the free equation ) furthermore allows to compute the values of @xmath93 to very high precision .",
    "for example , we obtain    _ 2,1 0.63546991 , _ 3,1 0.42363371 .",
    "we performed numerical simulations for the cases @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "both simulations were performed using a modification of the classical strmer - verlet method ( see for example @xcite ) to take into account for the friction and the noise .",
    "the modification was done in such a way that the resulting method is still of order two .",
    "the simulation for @xmath114 was performed at a stepsize @xmath115 , and the simulation for @xmath116 was performed at a stepsize @xmath117 . both simulations used @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "( figures/)figure4 ( figures/)figure6    the prediction obtained from with the values is shown as a dashed line on these figures , but it fits the numerics so well that it is nearly invisible .",
    "we emphasize that there were _ no _ free parameters in the fit , all constants are predicted by the theory .",
    "note that the timescale in the second picture differs by a factor @xmath120 from the timescale in the first picture .      in this section",
    ", we argue that the energy decay rate predicted by also yields a prediction on the qualitative nature of the spectrum of the generator of in the weighted space @xmath20 , where @xmath15 is the invariant measure .",
    "the idea is to model the behavior of the energy @xmath121 by a one - dimensional diffusion of the type    dx = ( b(x)+ a(x)a(x ) ) dt + a(x ) dw(t ) .",
    "it is well - known that the invariant measure for is given by    \\(dx ) = z^-1 ( 2_0^x b(t )",
    "a^2(t)dt ) .",
    "since we expect the invariant measure of to behave roughly like @xmath122 ( up to lower - order corrections ) , we should choose @xmath123 such that @xmath124 for large @xmath125 . combining this with",
    ", we obtain the model    b(x ) = - x^ , a(x ) = x^/2,= 2nk + 1 - 2n ,    which has @xmath126 as its invariant measure ( we restrict ourselves to the half - space @xmath127 ) .",
    "note that since @xmath2 ( the pinning potential grows faster than the coupling potential ) , one has always @xmath128 .    with the choice , the generator for is then given by    ( f)(x ) = 12 _ x ( x^_x f)(x ) - x^ _ x f(x ) .",
    "since the operator @xmath129 is a unitary operator from the weighted space @xmath130 to the flat @xmath54 space , the operator @xmath18 is unitarily equivalent to the operator @xmath131 on @xmath54 given by    ( _ 1 f)(x ) = 12 _ x ( x^_x f)(x ) - x^-12(x - ) .    at this point",
    ", we recall that if @xmath132 is a strictly increasing differentiable function with @xmath133 and @xmath134 , then the operator    ( u_f)(x ) = f((x ) )    is a unitary operator from @xmath135 to itself which furthermore satisfies the identity @xmath136 . under conjugation with @xmath137",
    ", we see that one has the unitary equivalences    _ x _ x -  ( x ) 2 ( (x))^2 , v(x ) v((x ) ) .    choosing @xmath138 , we see that @xmath131 is unitarily equivalent to the operator @xmath139 given by    ( _ 2 f)(x ) & = 12 ( 2 - 2_x + 4x ) ( 2 - 2_x - 4x ) - x^2 - 22 - 2 ( x^2 2- - ) + & = ( 2-)^2 8_x^2 + ( ( 2- ) 16 - ^232 ) x^-2 - x^2 - 2 2 - 2 ( x^22- - )    this is a schrdinger operator with a potential that behaves at infinity like @xmath140 .",

    "see for example @xcite for a proof .",
    "it is then a natural conjecture that the spectrum of the generator of on the @xmath54 space weighted by the invariant measure has the same behavior ( as a function of the parameter @xmath145 ) as just described .",
    "the next section is a step towards a proof of this conjecture .",
    "the aim of this section is to obtain information on the location of the essential spectrum of the generator @xmath18 for .",
