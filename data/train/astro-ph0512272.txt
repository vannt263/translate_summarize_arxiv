    "one of the great unsolved problems of planet formation is how to form planetesimals , the kilometer - sized precursors of real planets @xcite . at this size",
    "solid bodies in a protoplanetary disk can attract each other through gravitational two - body encounters , whereas gravity is insignificant between smaller bodies .",
    "starting from micrometer - sized dust grains , the initial growth is caused by the random brownian motion of the grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the vertical component of the gravity from the central object causes the gas in the disk to be stratified with a higher pressure around the mid - plane . even though the dust grains do not feel this pressure gradient , the strong frictional coupling with the gas prevents small grains from having any significant vertical motion relative to the gas",
    "however , once the grains have coagulated to form pebbles with sizes of a few centimeters , the solids are no longer completely coupled to the gas motion .",
    "they are thus free to fall , or sediment , towards the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "the increase in dust density opens a promising way of forming planetesimals by increasing the local dust density around the mid - plane of the disk to values high enough for gravitational fragmentation of the dust layer @xcite .",
    "there are however two major unresolved problems with the gravitational fragmentation scenario .",
    "any global turbulence in the disk causes the dust grains to diffuse away from the mid - plane , and thus the dust density is kept at values that are too low for fragmentation .",
    "a turbulent @xmath0-value of @xmath1 is generally enough to prevent efficient sedimentation towards the mid - plane @xcite , whereas the @xmath0-value due to magnetorotational turbulence @xcite is from a few times @xmath2 ( found in local box simulations with no imposed magnetic field ) to 0.1 and higher ( in global disk simulations ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetically dead zone around the disk mid - plane @xcite may not mean that there is no turbulence in the mid - plane , as other instabilities may set in and produce significant turbulent motion @xcite .",
    "the magnetically active surface layers of the disk can even induce enough turbulent motion in the mid - plane to possibly prevent efficient sedimentation of dust @xcite .",
    "the presence of a dead zone may actually _ in itself _",
    "be a source of turbulence .",
    "the sudden fall of the accretion rate can lead to a pile up of mass in the dead zone , possibly igniting the magnetorotational instability in bursts @xcite or a rossby wave instability @xcite .",
    "the second major problem with the gravitational fragmentation scenario is that even in the absence of global disk turbulence , the dust sedimentation may in itself destabilize the disk .",
    "protoplanetary disks have a radial pressure gradient , because the temperature and the density fall with increasing radial distance from the central object , so the gas rotates at a speed that is slightly below the keplerian value .",
    "the dust grains feel only the gravity and want to rotate purely keplerian .",
    "close to the equatorial plane of the disk , where the sedimentation of dust has increased the dust - to - gas ratio to unity or higher , the gas is forced by the dust to orbit at a higher speed than far away from the mid - plane where the rotation is still sub - keplerian .",
    "thus there is a vertical dependence of the gas rotation velocity .",
    "such shear flow can be unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , depending on the stabilizing effect of vertical gravity and density stratification . a necessary criterion for the khi",
    "is that the energy required to lift a fluid parcel of gas and dust vertically upwards by an infinitesimal distance is available in the relative vertical motion between infinitesimally close parcels @xcite .",
    "the turbulent motions resulting from the khi are strong enough to puff up the dust layer and prevent the formation of an infinitesimally thin dust sheet around the mid - plane of the disk @xcite .",
    "modifications to the gravitational fragmentation scenario have been suggested to overcome the problem of kelvin - helmholtz turbulence .",
    "@xcite ( 1998 , hereafter referred to as s98 ) found that if the mid - plane of the disk is in a state of constant richardson number , as expected for small grains whose settling time is long compared to the growth rate of the khi , then an increase in the global dust - to - gas ratio can lead to the formation of a high density dust cusp very close to the mid - plane of the disk , reaching potentially a dust - to - gas ratio of 100 already at a global dust - to - gas ratio that is 10 times the canonical interstellar value of @xmath3 .",
    "the appearance of a superdense dust cusp in the very mid - plane has been interpreted by @xcite as an inability of the gas ( or of the khi ) to move more mass than its own away from the mid - plane . as a source of an increased value of the global dust - to - gas ratio , @xcite",
    "suggest that the dust grains falling radially inwards through the disk pile up in the inner disk .",
    "a slowly growing radial self - gravity mode in the dust density has also been suggested as the source of an increased dust - to - gas ratio at certain radial locations @xcite . trapping dust boulders in a turbulent flow is a mechanism for avoiding the problem of self - induced kelvin - helmholtz turbulence altogether @xcite . if the dust can undergo a gravitational fragmentation locally , because the boulders are trapped in features of the turbulent gas flow such as vortices or high - pressure regions ,",
    "then there is no need for an extremely dense dust layer around the mid - plane .",
    "@xcite found that meter - sized dust boulders are temporarily trapped in regions of slight gas overdensity in magnetorotational turbulence , increasing the dust - to - gas ratio locally by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "they estimate that the dust in such regions should have time to undergo gravitational fragmentation before the high - pressure regions dissolve again .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , find that vortices can even form in magnetorotationally turbulent disks , keeping dust boulders trapped for hundreds of disk rotation periods .",
    "the khi can not operate inside a vortex because there is no radial pressure gradient , and thus no vertical shear , in the center of the vortex @xcite .    from a numerical side",
    "it has been shown many times that a pure shear flow , i.e.  one that is not explicitly supported by any forces , is unstable , both with magnetic fields @xcite and without @xcite .",
    "but the key point here is that the vertical shear formed in a protoplanetary disk is due to the sedimentation of dust , and that the shear is able to regenerate as the dust falls down again , thus keeping the flow unstable to khi . the description of the full non - linear outcome of such a system requires numerical simulations that include dust that can move relative to the gas .",
    "linear stability analysis of dust - induced shear flows in protoplanetary disks have been performed for simplified physical conditions @xcite , but also with coriolis forces and keplerian shear included @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite ( 2005 , hereafter referred to as go05 ) took an approach to include the dust into their numerical simulations of the kelvin - helmholtz instability by having the dust grains so extremely well - coupled to the gas that they always move with the instantaneous velocity of the gas .",
    "this is indeed a valid description of the dynamics of tiny dust grains .",
    "however , the strong coupling to the gas does not allow the dust grains to fall back towards the mid - plane .",
    "thus the saturated state of the kelvin - helmholtz turbulence can not be reached this way .    in this paper we present computer simulations where",
    "we have let the dust grains , represented by particles each with an individual velocity vector and position , move relative to the gas .",
    "this allows us to obtain a state of self - sustained kelvin - helmholtz turbulence from which we can measure quantities such as the diffusion coefficient and the maximum dust density .",
    "a better knowledge of these important characteristics of kelvin - helmholtz turbulence is vital for our understanding of planet formation .",
    "we start by introducing the dynamical equations that we are going to solve for the gas and the particles .",
    "we consider a protoplanetary disk as a plane rotating with the keplerian frequency @xmath4 at a distance @xmath5 from a protostellar object .",
    "the plane is oriented so that only the azimuthal and vertical directions ( which we name @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) of the disk are treated .",
    "the absence of the radial @xmath8-direction means that the keplerian shear is ignored .",
    "the onset of the khi is very likely to be affected by the presence of radial shear , since the unstable modes of the khi are non - axisymmetric and therefore will be sheared out , but we believe the problem of kelvin - helmholtz turbulence in protoplanetary disks to be rich enough to allow for such a simplification as a first approach .",
    "there is of course the risk that the nature of the instability could change significantly with the inclusion of keplerian shear @xcite , but on the other hand , the results that we present here regard mostly the dynamics of dust particles in kelvin - helmholtz turbulence , and we expect the qualitative results to hold even with the inclusion of the keplerian shear .    as a dynamical solver we use the pencil code , a finite difference code that uses sixth order centered derivatives in space and a third order runge - kutta time integration scheme .",
    "see @xcite for details on the numerical schemes and test runs .",
    "the three components of the equation of motion of the gas are @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the velocity field of the gas measured relative to the keplerian velocity .",
    "we explain now in some detail the terms that are present on the right - hand - side of equations ( [ eq : eqmot1])([eq : eqmot3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8- and @xmath6-components of the equation of motion contain the coriolis force due to the rotating disk , to ensure that there is angular momentum conservation .",
    "since velocities are measured relative to the keplerian shear flow , the advection of the rotation flow by the radial velocity component has been added to the azimuthal component of the coriolis force , changing the factor @xmath11 to @xmath12 in equation ( [ eq : eqmot2 ] ) .",
    "we consider local pressure gradient forces only in the azimuthal and vertical directions , whereas there is a constant global pressure gradient force in the radial direction . the global density is assumed to fall radially outwards as @xmath13 , where @xmath0 is a constant .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the density decreases isothermally , we can write the radial pressure gradient force as @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath16 is the constant sound speed . rewriting this expression and using the isothermal disk expression @xmath17",
    ", we arrive at the expression @xmath18 we then proceed by defining the dimensionless disk parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scale - height to radius ratio of the disk . this parameter can be assumed to be a constant for a protoplanetary disk .",

    "such a cusp can form for two reasons when the dust - to - gas ratio is above unity .",
    "firstly because the gas flow is forced to be keplerian in such a large region around the mid - plane that the vertical shear is reduced there , stabilizing against the khi , and secondly because it requires a lot of energy to lift up so much dust away from the mid - plane .",
    "this effect has been interpreted by @xcite as the gas only being able to lift up its own equivalent mass due to khi .",
    "the initial condition of the gas is an isothermal , stratified disk with a scale height @xmath82 .",

    "the sub - keplerian velocity @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 this expression is obtained by setting @xmath96 in equation ( [ eq : eqmot1 ] ) .",
    "the dust grains , on the other hand , do not feel the global pressure gradient and would thus in the absence of friction move on a keplerian orbit with @xmath97 .",
    "the drag force from the gas , however , forces the dust grains to move at a speed that is below the keplerian value , at least when the dust - to - gas ratio is low .",
    "when the dust - to - gas ratio approaches unity or even larger , the gas is forced by the dust to move with keplerian speed . the equilibrium gas and dust velocity can be calculated as a function of dust - to - gas ratio @xcite , but we choose to simply start the gas with a sub - keplerian velocity and the dust with a keplerian velocity , and then let the velocities approach the equilibrium dynamically ( this happens within a few friction times ) . this way we have checked that the numerical solution indeed approaches the expressions by @xcite for all the velocity components of the gas and the dust , which serves as a control that the friction force from the dust particles on the gas has been correctly implemented in the code .    in the equilibrium state",
    "the gas has a positive radial velocity in the mid - plane , but this does not lead to any change of the gas density , since we have ignored the advection of the global density in the continuity equation . the effect of an outwards - moving mid - plane on the global dynamics of a protoplanetary disk is a promising topic of future research , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used for all variables in the azimuthal direction . in the vertical direction",
    "we impose a condition of zero vertical velocity , whereas the two other velocity components have a zero derivative condition over the boundary .",
    "the logarithmic mass density and the entropy have a condition of vanishing third derivatives over the vertical boundary .",

    "<S> we perform numerical simulations of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in the mid - plane of a protoplanetary disk . </S>",
    "<S> a two - dimensional corotating slice in the azimuthal  vertical plane of the disk is considered where we include the coriolis force and the radial advection of the keplerian rotation flow . </S>",
    "<S> dust grains , treated as individual particles , move under the influence of friction with the gas , while the gas is treated as a compressible fluid . </S>",
    "<S> the friction force from the dust grains on the gas leads to a vertical shear in the gas rotation velocity . </S>",
    "<S> as the particles settle around the mid - plane due to gravity , the shear increases , and eventually the flow becomes unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz instability . </S>",
    "<S> the kelvin - helmholtz turbulence saturates when the vertical settling of the dust is balanced by the turbulent diffusion away from the mid - plane . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthally averaged state of the self - sustained kelvin - helmholtz turbulence is found to have a constant richardson number in the region around the mid - plane where the dust - to - gas ratio is significant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the dust density has a strong non - axisymmetric component . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a powerful clumping mechanism , caused by the dependence of the rotation velocity of the dust grains on the dust - to - gas ratio , as the source of the non - axisymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations confirm recent findings that the critical richardson number for kelvin - helmholtz instability is around unity or larger , rather than the classical value of 1/4 . </S>"
