    ", we suggest a time - evolution calculational scheme starting from the linear problem with the harmonic potential alone while the nonlinearity and any additional potential ( such as the optical - lattice potential ) are slowly introduced during time evolution .",
    "this results in a stable numerical scheme for the stationary dark soliton as during time evolution the system always passes through successive stationary eigenstates of the nonlinear gp equation until the desired stationary dark soliton is obtained also as a stationary eigenstate of the final gp equation .",
    "the present approach is equally applicable to both repulsive and attractive interactions in one and three dimensions and eliminates the so called dynamical instability of the dark soliton in the presence of a trap and yields a robust stationary dark soliton . to demonstrate the robustness of the present numerical scheme",
    ", we illustrate the stable prolonged breathing oscillation of the dark soliton upon the application of a perturbation .",
    "we have presented our results in a dimensionless time unit . in a typical experimental situation",
    "this unit corresponds to about 1 ms .",
    "the stability of the dark soliton during few thousand units of time as considered in this paper is sufficient for this purpose .",
    "time scales beyond a few seconds are completely unrealistic in this context , since the condensate only lives for about 15 seconds , with the soliton predicted to have a much shorter lifespan due to thermal and quantum fluctuations even at very low temperatures .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that the black soliton with a  notch \" in the probability density with a zero at the minimum is a stationary eigenstate of the gp equation and can be efficiently generated numerically as a nonlinear continuation of the first vibrational excitation of the gp equation in both attractive and repulsive cases in one and three dimensions for pure harmonic as well as harmonic plus optical - lattice traps . </S>",
