    "high energy physics is described by quantum field theory ( qft ) and string theory .",
    "unfortunately , these theoretical descriptions are plagued by large hierarchies of energy scales associated to the existence of many possible vacua .",
    "such situation is at the root of the old and difficult cc problem @xcite , i.e. , the formidable task of trying to understand the enormous ratio between the theoretical computation of the vacuum energy density and its observed value , @xmath3 , obtained from modern cosmological data@xcite .",
    "the extremal possibility occurs when the planck mass  @xmath4 is used as the fundamental scale ; then the ratio @xmath5 becomes @xmath6 .",
    "one may think that physics at the planck scale is not well under control and that this enormous ratio might be fictitious .",
    "however , consider the more modest scale @xmath7 of the electroweak standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ( the experimentally most successful qft known to date ) , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the @xmath10 boson mass and @xmath11 gauge coupling , respectively . in this case , that ratio reads @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vacuum energy ( i.e.  the expectation value of the higgs potential ) and @xmath14 is the lower bound on the higgs boson mass . although one may envisage the possibility that there is a cancelation between the various theoretical contributions to the physical cc ( including the bare value ) , this has never been considered a realistic option owing to the enormous fine - tuning that it entails ( which , in addition , must be corrected order by order in perturbation theory ) .    in this letter , we discuss a dynamical mechanism that protects the universe from any initial cc of arbitrary magnitude @xmath15 , which could emerge , for instance , from quantum zero - point energy ( contributing roughly @xmath16 for any mass @xmath17 ) , phase transitions ( @xmath18 ) or even vacuum energy at the end of inflation .",
    "we admit that @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) can actually be an effective quantity evolving with time .",
    "phenomenological models with variable @xmath1 have been considered in many places in the literature and from different perspectives , see e.g.  @xcite . at the same time , models with variable cc with a closer relation to fundamental aspects of qft have also been proposed@xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the effective quantity @xmath19 still has an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath22 and , in this sense , it can be called a cc term .",
    "the basic framework of our proposal is the generalized class of @xmath2xcdm models introduced in @xcite , in which there is a fixed or variable @xmath1 term together with an additional `` effective '' component @xmath23 ( in general _ not _ related to a fundamental , e.g.  scalar , field ) .",
    "this particular class of variable cc models is especially significant in that they could cure the cosmic coincidence problem@xcite in full consistency with cosmological perturbations@xcite . here",
    "we present a generalization of these models that might even cure the old ( `` big '' ) cc problem@xcite .",
    "recently , in@xcite a model along these lines was introduced with a de density  @xmath24 and an inhomogeneous eos @xmath25 which includes a term proportional to the negative power of the hubble rate  @xmath26 .",
    "this additional term becomes sufficiently large to compensate an initial @xmath27 when this is about to dominate the universe and forces it eventually into a final de  sitter era with a small cc . for recent related work on relaxation mechanisms ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . in a different vein",
    ", the cc problem can also be addressed in quantum cosmology models of inflation , through the idea of multiuniverses@xcite and the application of anthropic considerations@xcite .",
    "let us recall that , historically , most of the models addressing the relaxation of the cc were based on dynamical adjustment mechanisms involving scalar field potentials@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the relaxation mechanism that we propose is also dynamical , it does not require any fine - tuning and , as noted , it does not depend in general on scalar fields . to be more precise ,",
    "the model we present here is a @xmath2xcdm relaxation model of the cc , which includes also matter and radiation eras .",
    "we study the two possibilities @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with arbitrary value . for @xmath28 ,",
    "our scenario avoids the big crunch at early times and allows the cosmos to evolve starting from a radiation regime with subsequent matter and de sitter eras like the standard @xmath2cdm model .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that our method to tackle the cc problem is formulated directly at the level of the ( generalized ) field equations , rather than from an effective action functional . in this sense",
    ", we follow the historical path of einstein s derivation of the original field equations . at the moment , a version of our model with an action functional is not available , but its efficiency at the level of the field equations is truly remarkable , as we will show . in this sense ,",
    "its phenomenological success may constitute a first significant step in the way of finding a solution of the difficult cc problem .",
    "the present letter is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we present the basic setup of our model .",
    "in section [ toymodel ] we present a toy model of the cc relaxation mechanism which helps to understand the basic idea behind our proposal , although it is still too simple to describe our universe . only in section [ fullmodel ]",
    "we present a first realistic version of the full relaxation mechanism and we perform a numerical analysis of it . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss in more detail some aspects and implications of our model .",
    "finally , in the last section we draw our conclusions .",
    "we start from the generalized einstein field equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter  including the energy densities of radiation ( @xmath32 ) and baryons ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 describes the x component ( @xmath35 ) , interacting with the effective cc term @xmath36 in such a way that the total density of the dark sector , @xmath37 , is covariantly conserved ( in accordance with the bianchi identity ) . the effective cc density @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 here , @xmath27 is an arbitrarily large initial ( and constant ) cosmological term , and @xmath40 is some function of the general coordinate invariant terms @xmath41,\\label{eq : invariants - rst}\\\\ t & \\equiv & r_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}r^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}=12h^{4}(1+q^{2})\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we have evaluated in the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in terms of the expansion rate  @xmath42 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath43 . we find it useful to write the structure of @xmath44 in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimension @xmath47 parameter and @xmath48 is a dimension @xmath49 function of the aforementioned invariants .",
    "this form is particularly convenient since the function @xmath50 must grow at high energies and hence the vacuum energy is ultraviolet safe , i.e.  in the early universe @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath27 is arbitrarily large but finite .",
    "the generalized field equations ( [ gee ] ) fall into the metric - based category of extensions of general relativity .",
    "however , at this point the following observation is in order . in the literature ,",
    "the extensions of einstein s field equations are usually of a restricted class , namely those that can be derived from effective gravitational actions of the form @xmath53\\,.\\ ] ] this class of models may be called the `` f(r , s , t)-theories '' as they are characterized by an arbitrary ( albeit sufficiently differentiable ) local function @xmath54 of the invariants defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : invariants - rst ] ) , usually some polynomial of these invariants .",
    "work along these lines has been put forward e.g.in@xcite .",
    "the particular subclass of models in which the function @xmath54 depends only on @xmath55 , or `` f(r)-theories '' , is well known and has been subject of major interest@xcite .",
    "however , as advertised in the introduction , in this work we formulate the relaxation mechanism directly in terms of the generalized field equations ( [ gee ] ) , without investigating at the moment the eventual connection with an appropriate effective action .",
    "the reason is , basically , because we aim at maximal simplicity at the moment . to be sure , after many years of unsuccessful attempts ,",
    "the cc problem has revealed itself as one of the most difficult problems ( if not the most difficult one ) of all theoretical physics ; and we should not naively expect to shoot squarely at it and hope to hit the jackpot at the first trial , so to speak . in this sense , if we can find a way to solve , or at least to significantly improve , the problem directly at the level of the field equations , we might then find ourselves in a truly vantage point to subsequently attempt solving the cc problem at the level of some generalized form of the effective action of gravity .",
    "all in all , let us warn the reader that the connection between the two approaches ( viz .",
    "the one based on the field equations and the functional one ) is , if existent , non - trivial .",
    "in fact , we note that the presumed action behind the field equations ( [ gee ] ) need not be of the local form ( [ frst ] ) , and in general we can not exclude that it may involve some complicated contribution from non - local terms",
    ". these terms , however involved they might be , are nevertheless welcome and have been advocated in the recent literature as a possible solution to the dark energy problem from different perspectives @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we wish to put aside the discussion of these terms , and , for that matter , all issues related to the hypothetical action functional behind our field equations . instead , we want to exclusively concentrate on the phenomenological possibilities that our framework can provide on relaxing the effective cc term ( [ eq : rhol - intro ] ) depending on the choice of the function @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , if the initial @xmath27 is a very large cosmological constant associated to a strong phase transition ( e.g.  some gut phase transition triggering the process of inflation , the zero point energy of some field , or just the electroweak vacuum energy of the sm ) , the late time behavior of @xmath38 can be sufficiently tamed ( without fine - tuning ) so as to be perfectly acceptable by the known cosmological data .",
    "the main aim of the present approach is thus of practical nature ; if the cc problem can be efficiently tackled at the level of the field equations to start with ( something that , to the best of our knowledge , has never been accomplished before ) , it should fit the bill as it can be already a crucial first step in the path to solve the cc problem  namely , before unleashing a more formal ( and , predictably , even more difficult ) theoretical assault to it at the effective action level .",
    "we leave this part of the investigation for future work , and we concentrate here on the potential phenomenological benefits of assuming a set of generalized field equations of the form ( [ gee ] ) .",
    "let us first illustrate the mechanism for a universe with only radiation and with @xmath50 equal to just the ricci scalar  @xmath55 , so that eq.([eq : rhol - intro ] ) becomes @xmath56 to start with , we consider the case @xmath28 ( as in the sm case ) and take @xmath57 .",
    "let us also assume a spatially flat universe . at late times ,",
    "the de  sitter regime is realized and the deceleration approaches the value  @xmath58 while the hubble rate becomes constant and very small ,  @xmath59 ( of order of the current rate @xmath60 ) .",
    "the vacuum energy density takes on the tiny observed value @xmath61 , which is related to  @xmath62 by the friedmann equation : @xmath63 .",
    "since the initial value  @xmath64 is assumed to be much larger than  @xmath65 , the final hubble rate is approximately given by @xmath66 we observe that the large @xmath64 is responsible for the small final value of  @xmath62 , provided the parameter  @xmath46 has a suitable order of magnitude and without any need of fine - tuning because this relation does not include differences between large numbers ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on fine - tuning issues ) .",
    "moreover , this solution is stable .",
    "indeed , the driving of @xmath67 to small values by the large and negative @xmath28 becomes compensated by the positive second term in  @xmath38 , which grows as  @xmath26 decreases . on the other hand , a potential instability caused by a growing @xmath26",
    "would also be unharmful because it would make the second term decrease , so that  @xmath28 would stabilize @xmath26 again .    at earlier times , @xmath68 and the relaxation of @xmath69 originates from the  @xmath70 factor in the function  @xmath50 , namely the negative  @xmath27 drives dynamically the deceleration parameter  @xmath71 to larger values until @xmath71 becomes very close to  @xmath72 , which corresponds to radiation - like expansion .",
    "however , @xmath71 can not cross @xmath73 from below since the ( positive ) second term in  @xmath38 would dominate over  @xmath27 and stop the cosmic deceleration before @xmath71 reaches @xmath72 . summarizing , this simplified model keeps the enormous vacuum energy  @xmath27 under control at any time thanks to the relaxation mechanism implemented in the function  @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rinv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it provides a reasonable expansion history with radiation - like expansion ( @xmath74 , @xmath26 large ) in the past and a stable de  sitter solution ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 tiny ) in the future .",
    "the transition is smooth and happens when the hubble rate is sufficiently small to ensure the cc relaxation as explained above .",
    "the simple model discussed above is able to handle the large negative term  @xmath27 without abrupt changes in the expansion history .",
    "however , the model is unrealistic in that there is no matter era yet , because @xmath71 will stay around the radiation domination value  @xmath74 until the de sitter phase starts .",
    "therefore , we have to make sure that the universe goes also through the matter epoch by completing the structure of @xmath38 with a term proportional to  @xmath77 , which would work like  @xmath78 but with  @xmath79 as the stabilizing point for the next high @xmath26 interval . for this purpose",
    ", we use the scalar invariants from eq .",
    "( [ eq : invariants - rst ] ) .",
    "a useful expression is to involve not only @xmath55 but also @xmath80 , as follows : @xmath81 notice that this combination is proportional to  @xmath82 and hence allows the relaxation of the vacuum energy in the matter era .",
    "again , this expression alone would be unrealistic because it would enforce the universe to linger in the matter era and would prevent the existence of a preceding radiation era .",
    "however , we can combine the three invariants @xmath83 to finally form a much more realistic ansatz for @xmath50 in eq.([eq : rinv ] ) , i.e.  in such a way that the radiation and matter epochs occur sequentially before the de  sitter universe is eventually reached in the infrared . indeed , consider the expression @xmath84 we see that @xmath50 is constructed such that the first term contains only two powers of  @xmath26 , which ensures that the cosmic evolution is reasonably close to that of the @xmath85cdm model during the matter and subsequent de  sitter stages .",
    "general behavior of the deceleration parameter  @xmath71 in the relaxation cc model ( [ eq : rhol - intro ] ) ( solid ) and in the @xmath85cdm model ( dashed ) as a function of the cosmological redshift @xmath86 . for any initial @xmath27",
    ", the universe goes through a radiation - dominated epoch ( @xmath73 ) , a matter - dominated epoch ( @xmath79 ) and , eventually , into a final de  sitter phase ( @xmath75 ) with @xmath87 .",

    ", the factor  @xmath70 will dominate over  @xmath90 for large values of @xmath26 , i.e. , during the radiation regime .    the matter  radiation transition ( `` equality '' )",
    "happens when both terms in  @xmath50 are of the same magnitude and the corresponding time is fixed by the parameter  @xmath91 , where  @xmath92 is the hubble rate at equality .",
    "the generic behavior of @xmath71 for the relaxation model under consideration can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : decel - q ] .",
    "the transitions between different epochs are not as smooth as in the @xmath85cdm cosmos , although this feature depends on the detailed form of the function  @xmath50 . for our illustrative purposes",
    ", the qualitative results given here should be sufficient to appreciate the virtues of this relaxation mechanism .",
    "its main benefit is the complete insensitivity of the universe with respect to an initial cosmological constant @xmath27 of arbitrary magnitude ( which in the present example we have chosen to be negative ) .",
    "remarkably enough , our construction does not require to fine - tune any of the parameters of the model .",
    "thus , the insurmountable problems associated to the traditional `` cancelation '' procedure can be solved automatically through this dynamical relaxation mechanism , which is triggered by pure gravitational physics ( no scalar fields at all ) .",
    "the current value  @xmath65 of the effective vacuum energy and the corresponding low hubble rate  @xmath62 are fixed only by the magnitude of the parameter  @xmath46 , which is the @xmath93 power of a mass scale  @xmath94 . since @xmath15 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rinv ] ) and ( [ eq : rho_l ] ) indicate that @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",

    "can be rephrased in another suggestive way .",
    "since @xmath100 in the eventual de sitter regime  which starts approximately near our time  , we find that the current value of the cc ( which is of the order of the asymptotic value @xmath101 ) is roughly given by the appropriate ratio of the two order parameters characterizing the most extreme phase transitions ever occurred in our universe : @xmath102 so far , the discussion of the cc relaxation was based only on the form of @xmath38 in eq .",

    "are covariantly conserved leading to the usual scaling laws @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "since the dark sector does not interact with the conventional components , @xmath24 is conserved , too . from the bianchi identity satisfied by the terms on the _ l.h.s . _  of eq.([gee ] ) and the covariant conservation law of ordinary matter ( @xmath107 ) , the corresponding covariant conservation in the dark sector reads @xmath108=0\\,.\\ ] ] let us assume that @xmath23 is a pressureless component . computing the previous expression in the flrw metric , it boils down to @xmath109 this equation shows that the two components of @xmath24 are actually interacting .",
    "the fact that the eos parameter of @xmath23 is taken to be @xmath110 ( i.e.  pressureless ) is because @xmath23 can then mimic ( and can be referred to as ) dark matter ( dm ) . in this sense ,",
    "the energy density of the dark sector , @xmath24 , can be thought of as being the sum of the dm and de ( interacting ) energy densities , where the de one is , in turn , the sum of the true cosmological constant @xmath27 and the effective gravitational component @xmath44 , i.e.eq.([eq:rhol-intro ] ) .",
    "thus , we have all the necessary ingredients to implement realistically our universe within the relaxation model .",

    "this should suffice to illustrate the great efficiency of this relaxation mechanism .",
    "since @xmath130 , eq .  ( [ eq : beta ] ) yields @xmath131 .",
    "notice that in the presence of several phase transitions , the value of @xmath132 is fixed by the strongest one .",
    "we have seen above that @xmath133 for all transitions below the planck scale .",
    "the following two points are in order concerning the role played by the @xmath23 component . on the one hand , let us note that we have taken @xmath23 as representing the full dark matter ( dm ) content of the universe .",
    "this is a possibility , which we have chosen for definiteness in this presentation of the model , in part for simplicity and also because , then , the quantity @xmath134 provides a kind of economical unification of the dm and de parts into an overall , self - conserved , dark sector .",
    "however , this ansatz must be further elaborated .",
    "in particular , it must be confronted with the structure formation data from the analysis of cosmic perturbations in this model@xcite .",
    "another possibility would be , for instance , that the `` conventional dm '' is contained in what we have called the ordinary energy - momentum tensor in eq.([gee ] ) . in this alternative scenario ,",
    "the total matter content is covariantly conserved , and @xmath23 appears as a kind of additional entity in the de sector , which would interact with the effective cc , and whose only purpose is to make the total de covariantly conserved .",
    "since we still have @xmath110 , the entity @xmath23 looks now more as a new form of dm that is integrated into the de .    on the other hand ,",
    "once the dynamics of @xmath38 is fixed , in this case through ( [ eq : rhol - intro ] ) and ( [ eq : rho_l ] ) , the evolution of the component @xmath23 , in whatever of the two options discussed above , is completely determined by the local covariant conservation law ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 can not be generally assimilated to a scalar field , because a dynamical scalar field with some particular potential has its own dynamics . in this sense",
    ", @xmath23 is to be viewed as an effective entity within the generalized field equations . in the particular option that we have analyzed in fig.[fig : energydensities ] , it is supposed to mimic all effects associated to a real dm substratum .",
    "effective equation of state  @xmath135 and relative effective de density  @xmath136 .",
    "parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : energydensities ] . ]",
    "let us now further describe the different stages of cosmic evolution in this framework .",
    "first , in the matter era , the total energy density is dominated by the dm component @xmath35 rather than by the vacuum energy  @xmath38 . due to @xmath137",
    "this can be understood easily by eliminating @xmath35 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fried1],[eq : fried2 ] ) , @xmath138 therefore , this epoch behaves very similar to the @xmath85cdm matter era .",
    "finally , the vacuum component becomes dominant at very late times and the universe smoothly enters the eternal de  sitter regime with a very small positive @xmath139 . in both eras , the relaxation model does not deviate much from the @xmath85cdm model , and the sign of the large initial vacuum density  @xmath27 is not relevant .",
    "significant deviations from standard cosmology emerge in the radiation era , because there is no constraint that enforces  @xmath38 to be negligible .",
    "in fact , the exact behavior of  @xmath35 and  @xmath38 depends on initial conditions and the details of  @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless , in that epoch ( for which @xmath74 and @xmath33 is negligible ) , subtraction of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fried1],[eq : fried2 ] ) leads to @xmath140 moreover , the second term in the function  @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_l ] ) is dominant in the radiation era ( by construction ) .",
    "thus , while radiation dominates we have @xmath141 and by eliminating the ricci scalar  @xmath55 from the two previous equations , we obtain @xmath142 with @xmath143 , @xmath144 and the hubble rate  @xmath92 at the radiation  matter transition we find that the variable @xmath145 becomes subdominant for very large hubble rates  @xmath146 .",
    "( [ eq : rhol - rad ] ) has two solutions for  @xmath38 , @xmath147 and the physical one has to be compatible with @xmath148 at late times .",
    "also , @xmath35 is taken to be positive .    for negative initial vacuum energy  @xmath28",
    "the following limits exist . at very high redshift , where @xmath149 , the effective vacuum energy acts like a true ( and subdominant ) constant , @xmath150 thus , the universe evolves in a standard way , and the x component redshifts like non - interacting dust . at smaller redshift ,",
    "in the range when @xmath151 holds , we find a ( temporary ) tracking regime : @xmath152 in this regime , @xmath38 not only tracks the energy density of the x component , but also that of radiation @xmath32 . indeed , in view of ( [ eq : rplus ] ) , the conservation equation  ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) takes on the form @xmath153 during this regime .",
    "finally , for @xmath154 the relaxation of the cc becomes obvious by @xmath155 note that the analytical discussion is nicely supported by the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energydensities - highz ] .",
    "this relaxation regime also exists for positive initial @xmath29 , when @xmath156 , @xmath157 whereas for higher redshift , when @xmath158 , we also find a tracking regime , @xmath159 .",
    "however , differently from the @xmath28 case , this tracking behavior is persistent even for @xmath160 .",
    "consequently , at the end of reheating , the energy densities of radiation , dark matter and dark energy could be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "because of the tracking relation @xmath161 , we should care about bounds from nucleosynthesis . at that time ( @xmath162 )",
    ", we have in our example @xmath163 versus @xmath164 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : energydensities ] ) , and so the ratio @xmath165 is safe for standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( similarly as in@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this model offers also the possibility to solve the coincidence problem , in that @xmath35 ,  @xmath32 and @xmath38 are not very different during the tracking regime until the matter - radiation transition ( cf .",
    "[ fig : energydensities - highz ] ) .",
    "note also that in comparison to @xmath85cdm , much more dark matter is allowed before the relaxation regime thereby weakening the constraints on dark matter properties .",
    "finally , we discuss the effective eos  @xmath135 , which is a useful tool for comparing interacting de models with non - interacting ones .",
    "according to@xcite , @xmath135 is given by the eos of a self - conserved de component @xmath166 in an universe with the same hubble rate  @xmath167 and total energy density  @xmath168 as the relaxation model . within this effective description ,",
    "dm obeys the usual scaling law of dust  @xmath169 since the interaction with de is absent .",
    "thus , @xmath170 with  @xmath171 . since  @xmath172 is more accessible for observations at low redshift , we magnify this range in the second plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : effectiveeos2plots ] . in the relaxation regime",
    ", @xmath172 follows mostly the eos of the dominant component .",
    "notice that @xmath173 is well defined everywhere despite the behavior of @xmath135 .",
    "in this letter , we have addressed the old cosmological constant problem , i.e.  the difficult problem of relaxing the value of the cosmological vacuum energy .",
    "the necessity of tempering this value ably and plausibly is absolutely crucial for a realistic cosmological evolution from the early times till today .",
    "indeed , the vacuum energy of the early universe is expected to be huge in particle physics standards , since the expansion history must drive through a series of phase transitions of diverse nature ; in particular , it goes through a process of fast inflation ( presumably associated to some grand unified theory ) and also through the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "finally , it undergoes the more modest chiral symmetry breaking transition , which occurs at the milder scale @xmath174 gev and is connected to the quark - gluon - hadron transition .",
    "even if the latter would have been the only phase transition ever occurred , and the associated vacuum energy density would still persist , it would be a disaster for our universe .",
    "the reason is that the value of the cosmological constant associated to that energy density would have accelerated the expansion history to the point of preventing the formation of any of the structures that we now see in our cosmos , as they would have been ripped off by the fast expansion rate during the first stages of formation .",
    "however , being the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics such an extraordinary successful theoretical and experimental framework , we must conclude that both of its important contributions to the vacuum energy ( associated to the electroweak and strong interactions ) must have been relaxed very fast after the corresponding phase transitions occurred ; namely , sufficiently fast as to insure not only the possibility to form structures in the late universe , but also to leave the nucleosynthesis process fully unscathed after the first minute of expansion .    in this letter",
    ", we have tackled a possible cure to this longstanding problem ; we have proposed a dynamical relaxation mechanism of the vacuum energy that operates at the level of the generalized gravitational field equations .",
    "our relaxation mechanism achieves this goal without fine - tuning .",
    "apart from the ordinary baryonic matter , which in our model stays covariantly conserved , we assume that the dark sector is made out of an effective cosmological term @xmath38 and another dynamical component @xmath23 exchanging energy with it .",
    "the cosmological term of our model is actually an effective one , in the sense that it is defined as the sum of an arbitrarily large cosmological constant , @xmath27 , and a particular combination of curvature invariants , @xmath44 , such that the sum behaves as an overall cc term @xmath175 , but one that evolves with time .",
    "as we have said , the component @xmath23 interacts with the variable @xmath38 , but the total density of the dark sector , @xmath104 , is covariantly conserved .",
    "this construction fits into the class of the so - called @xmath2xcdm models existing in the literature@xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , in the present context , the @xmath23 component can be interpreted as the dark matter ( dm ) and the contribution @xmath44 can be viewed as a ( dynamical ) dark energy component that adds up to the traditional cosmological constant term . however , such dynamical de component has nothing to do with scalar fields as it is of purely gravitational origin .",
    "therefore , the total energy density of the dark sector splits into the sum of the various components dm , cc and de , namely @xmath176 , whereas the ordinary ( baryonic ) matter does not interact at all with the dark sector and remains safely conserved .",
    "the evolution of this @xmath2xcdm universe keeps the total de sub - dominant during the radiation and matter epochs , and only at late times it leads to a tiny effective cc whose smallness is a direct consequence of the large initial vacuum energy , @xmath27 , rather than to a severe fine - tuning involving ugly cancelation of large terms .",
    "the resulting cosmos can transit from a fast early inflationary universe , then drive through the standard radiation and matter dominated epochs and , eventually , ends up in an extremely slow de sitter phase ; in fact , a model of universe very close to the one suggested by the modern cosmological data@xcite .",
    "finally , we obtained new insights into the coincidence problem , as we observed an interesting tracking behavior in the radiation era .",
    "a more detailed exposition of our approach discussing the universality of the cc relaxation and the corresponding analysis of the cosmological perturbations will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",

    "<S> however , the oldest , toughest and most intriguing face of this polyhedron is the big cc problem , namely why the measured value of @xmath1 at present is so small as compared to any typical density scale existing in high energy physics , especially taking into account the many phase transitions that our universe has undergone since the early times , including inflation . in this letter , </S>",
    "<S> we propose to extend the field equations of general relativity by including a class of invariant terms that automatically relax the value of the cc irrespective of the initial size of the vacuum energy in the early epochs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , at late times , the universe enters an eternal de sitter stage mimicking a tiny positive cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these models could be able to solve the big cc problem without fine - tuning and have also a bearing on the cosmic coincidence problem . </S>",
