    "one such relationship is advocated by @xcite , in which stellar halo abundances are derived from color measurements of the red giant branch in off - disk fields and shown to increase with galactic luminosity across a wide range @xmath105 , although @xcite claims this correlation is non - existent when halo stars are kinematically selected .",
    "a more recent application of this method to an rgb - star survey of the galaxy - analogue system ngc  891 has shown a broad ihl abundance distribution centered around @xmath106 , more metal - rich by a factor of three than the stellar halos of both large local group galaxies @xcite .",
    "we do predict a strong rise in halo metallicity as host mass increases through the galactic scale ( shown in figure  [ fig : result ] ) , but the wide scatter at fixed mass suggests that the statistical accuracy of any such empirically - derived relation would be dramatically contaminated by variance in the individual mass assembly processes for each galaxy , as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : ohvsihl ] in which we obtain a power - law relationship between ihl abundance and the fraction of a system s stellar mass contributed by the intrahalo component ( @xmath107 in @xmath76_{\\mathrm{ihl}}}\\propto n$ ]  log  @xmath108 ) , spanning the widest range at galactic scales and thereby suggesting that stellar halo metallicity more properly correlates with the luminosity of the stellar halo , and not necessarily the luminosity of the parent galaxy .",
    "this correlation grows weaker when we consider increasingly more massive host halos , as the ihl metallicity distribution tightens and the ihl fraction flattens .",
    "we predict an @xmath76_{\\mathrm{ihl}}}$ ] value of @xmath109 for weak groups such as the local group , which has a mass @xmath110 according to @xcite , although observational constraints in this regime remain elusive . on still larger scales ,",
    "the virgo cluster provides a more useful laboratory for the study of intrahalo stellar metallicity , although systematic errors in the photometry of rgb - tip stars in these fields cause great variance in the abundance values yielded ( _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* in which the authors obtain @xmath111 ) . in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite identify @xmath112 intracluster stars in virgo , determining that @xmath113 of them are older than @xmath114 gyr and populated over a wide range in abundance ( @xmath115 ) , as we might expect from a diffuse population with multiple origins ; the remaining @xmath116 of the intrahalo population has a metallicity distribution function peaking near solar values , these younger stars having been more recently orphaned by disruption processes acting on their parent galaxy .",
    "still more metal - rich is the intrahalo population of the cluster abell 3888 , which contains one component having formed at redshift @xmath117 with high metallicity ( @xmath118 ) , as well as a more centralized diffuse region at roughly solar abundance @xcite .",
    "the variation in our predicted distribution is of order @xmath119 dex , although the location of the plateau varies significantly with surface brightness cuts intended to separate older intrahalo populations from dynamically young ihl plumes in galaxy clusters .",
    "typical measurements of intracluster light have analyzed fields without obvious luminous substructure , corresponding to the spheroidal halo of field stars in spiral galaxies .",
    "it appears that we must be careful about claims as to how much stellar mass actually lies in long - disrupted satellite remnants , as opposed to relatively bright diffuse tidal streams .",
    "however , it is worth noting that stellar halo observations of galaxies outside the local group can not distinguish stream - like substructure from background field stars , just as intragroup and intracluster studies can not .",
    "tidal features such as m31 s giant southern stream are rich in stellar mass ( the progenitor may have been as bright as a billion solar luminosities according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as metals ( @xmath120 according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we can reconcile our predictions with current galactic measurements given the caveat that typical halo metallicities reflect the underlying stellar component , without the inclusion of bright outer - halo substructure resulting from massive accretion events , a distinction made more clear by a recent semi - analytic treatment of baryon dynamics in numerical models of l@xmath121-galaxy halos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for details of the simulation ) .",
    "we also predict a clear correlation between the oxygen abundance and the surface brightness of tidal streams in galaxy clusters , a prediction that will be testable as future deep surveys come online and metallicity distribution functions become more well - studied in diffuse intrahalo stellar populations at and above the galaxy scale .",
