    "the @xmath0 collisions at hera provide a unique possibility to search for new particles coupling directly to a lepton and a quark .",
    "leptoquarks ( lqs ) , colour triplet bosons that do just that , are an example of such particles and appear in many theories attempting to unify the quark and lepton sectors of the standard model ( sm ) .    a discussion of the phenomenology of lqs at hera can be found elsewhere  @xcite . in the framework of the buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw ) effective model  @xcite , lqs",
    "are classified into @xmath6 types with respect to the quantum numbers spin @xmath7 , weak isospin @xmath8 and chirality @xmath9 , resulting in seven scalar ( @xmath10 ) and seven vector ( @xmath11 ) lqs .",
    "some lqs may decay to a neutrino - quark pair and in such cases the branching fraction for decays into charged leptons is assumed within the brw model to be .",
    "leptoquarks carry both lepton ( @xmath12 ) and baryon ( @xmath13 ) quantum numbers , and the fermion number is assumed to be conserved .",
    "leptoquark processes proceed at hera directly via @xmath14-channel resonant lq production or indirectly via @xmath15-channel virtual lq exchange .",
    "a dimensionless parameter @xmath16 defines the coupling at the lepton - quark - lq vertex . for lq masses well below the centre - of - mass energy @xmath17  gev , the @xmath14-channel production of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) lqs in @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) collisions",
    "however , for lq masses above @xmath22 , both the @xmath14 and @xmath15-channel processes are important such that both @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions have similar sensitivity to all lqs types .    assuming a lq produced at hera observes flavour conservation , which is implicit in the brw model , then such a particle would decay exclusively into a quark and a first generation lepton , @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "dedicated searches have been performed by h1 for such _ first generation _ lqs , where the sm expectation is dominated by neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) background  @xcite . a search for first generation leptoquarks",
    "was recently completed using the complete h1 data set , where for a coupling of electromagnetic strength @xmath25 , first generation lqs are excluded at @xmath3 confidence level ( cl ) up to leptoquark masses of @xmath26  gev , depending on the leptoquark type  @xcite .",
    "a more general extension of the brw model allows for the decay of lqs to final states containing a quark and a lepton of a different flavour , i.e. a muon or tau lepton .",
    "non - zero couplings @xmath27 to an electron - quark pair and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) to a muon(tau)-quark pair are therefore assumed .",
    "the indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent quark generation indices , such that @xmath27 denotes the coupling of an electron to a quark of generation @xmath30 , and @xmath32 is the coupling of the outgoing lepton ( where @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) to a quark of generation @xmath31 .",
    "an overview of this extended model for the lq coupling to @xmath15 and @xmath35 quarks is provided elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) to leptoquark models would mean the processes @xmath36 or @xmath37 , mediated by the exchange of a _ second _ or _ third generation _ leptoquark , would be observable at hera with final states containing a muon or the decay products of a tau lepton back - to - back with a hadronic system @xmath38 .",
    "the main sm background contribution to this topology is from photoproduction events , in which a hadron is wrongly identified as a muon or a narrow hadronic jet fakes the signature of the hadronic tau decay .",
    "similarly , the scattered electron in nc dis events may also be misinterpreted as the one - prong hadronic tau decay jet .",
    "smaller sm background contributions arise from events exhibiting intrinsic missing transverse momentum ( for example cc dis ) , events containing high @xmath39 leptons ( such as lepton pair production , particularly inelastic muon - pair events if one muon is unidentified ) or events with both of these features ( real @xmath40 production with leptonic decay ) .",
    "searches for such signatures have been previously performed by h1  @xcite and the latest analysis  @xcite is performed using the complete @xmath0 h1 collision data taken at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath1  gev , which was recorded during the years 1998 - 2007 .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosity of @xmath41  pb@xmath42 for @xmath43 collisions and @xmath44  pb@xmath42 for @xmath45 collisions represents an increase in size of the data sample with respect to the previous publication by a factor of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "leptoquarks with couplings to first and second generation leptons may decay to a muon and a quark .",
    "event topologies with an isolated , high transverse momentum @xmath39 muon back - to - back to a hadronic system in the transverse plane are therefore selected . several additional cuts based on the transverse and longitudinal event balance",
    "are employed to remove the sm background  @xcite .",
    "leptoquarks with couplings to first and third generation leptons may decay to a tau and a quark .",
    "tau leptons are identified using the muonic and one - prong hadronic decays of the tau .",
    "the analysis of the muonic decay channel employs the same selection as in the second generation lq search . the tau decay results in missing transverse momentum in the event due to the escaping neutrinos and this is exploited in the analysis of the hadronic decay channel , which also uses the track multiplicity of narrow jets to identify candidate one - prong tau decay jets .",
    "full details of the event selection can be found in the h1 publication  @xcite .",
    "after all selection cuts , the observed number of events is in agreement with the sm prediction and therefore no evidence for lfv is found . the reconstructed leptoquark mass in the search for @xmath36 and @xmath37 events is shown in figure  [ fig : massplots ] , compared to the sm prediction and an example lq signal with arbitrary normalisation .",
    "( left ) and @xmath37  ( right ) events .",
    "the data are the points and the total uncertainty on the sm expectation ( open histogram ) is given by the shaded band .",
    "the dashed histogram indicates the lq signal with arbitrary normalisation for a leptoquark mass of @xmath48  gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]  ( left ) and @xmath37  ( right ) events .",

    "in the absence of a signal , the results of the search are interpreted in terms of exclusion limits on the mass and the coupling of lqs mediating lfv using a modified frequentist method with a likelihood ratio as the test statistic .",
    "the lq production mechanism at hera involves non - zero coupling to the first generation fermions . for the lfv leptoquark decay",
    ", it is assumed that only one of the couplings @xmath49 and @xmath50 is non - zero and that @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig : limits ] shows the @xmath3 cl upper limits on the couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath19 lqs as a function of the mass of the lq leading to lfv in @xmath0 collisions .",

    "only first generation quarks are considered here , limits involving other quark flavours can be found in the h1 publication  @xcite .",
    "limits corresponding to lqs coupling to a @xmath15 quark are more stringent than those corresponding to lqs coupling to the @xmath35 quark only , as expected from the larger @xmath15 quark density in the proton .",
    "corresponding to the steeply falling parton density function for high values of @xmath54 , the lq production cross section decreases rapidly and exclusion limits are less stringent towards higher lq masses . for lq masses near the kinematic limit of @xmath55  gev ,",
    "the limit corresponding to a resonantly produced lq turns smoothly into a limit on the virtual effects of both an off - shell @xmath14-channel lq process and a @xmath15-channel lq exchange . for lq masses @xmath56 the two processes contract to an effective four - fermion interaction .    for @xmath57 ,",
