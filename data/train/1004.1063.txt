    "choosing @xmath220 , and for sufficiently small @xmath101 , the regularized length operator simplifies to @xmath221 noting that for sufficiently small @xmath101 and any given @xmath217 there is at most one vertex contribution i.e. @xmath222 for at most one vertex @xmath43 , we can equivalently evaluate the sum as @xmath223 finally , we can remove the regulator , i.e. take the limit as @xmath224 , and obtain our lqg length operator as @xmath225 expression is well defined , as it does not depend on any background information .",
    "however , there is a freedom of choice in the characteristic function ( a similar situation also occurs in the construction of the volume operator in @xcite ) .",
    "we may replace @xmath226 by @xmath227 where @xmath228 are arbitrary nonvanishing positive real numbers satisfying @xmath229 ( so that the integrand in ( 28 ) in the limit @xmath230 vanishes unless @xmath190 is a vertex @xmath231 ) in the regularized expression @xmath170 in .",
    "this results in the final quantum length operator being @xmath232 wherein @xmath233 .",
    "comparing to , we are happy to observe that our two strategies of regularization lead to essentially the same length operator .",
    "so far we have constructed a family of operators @xmath234 , where @xmath235 denotes the domain of @xmath236 ; but the proof for the cylindrical consistency ( this yields a length operator @xmath136 on @xmath237 ) of the family of operators is the same as that for the volume operator ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so we shall omit it here .",
    "regularization ambiguities arise rather frequently in the quantization procedure .",
    "especially , different regularization strategies would lead to different operators .",
    "however , in our length operator two quite different regularization procedures lead to essentially the same final expression .",
    "this strengthens our confidence in the construction .",
    "although the length operator is well defined and background independent , there exists an overall undetermined factor @xmath238 ( or @xmath239 ) arising from averaging over the relevant structure in the first derivation ( or through the choice of the characteristic function employed in the second derivation ) which needs to be fixed . in order to fix the ambiguity ,",
    "two strategies can be adopted .",
    "the first strategy is through the semiclassical limit of the length operator - for instance , the recent semiclassical analysis of the volume operator developed in @xcite can also be applied to our length operator .",
    "the second method is through a consistency check .",
    "since @xmath240 in ( or @xmath241 in ) is just an alternative expression of the triad operator defined on a vertex @xmath43 , the consistency check of volume and triad operator quantizations ( as was carried out in @xcite to fix the ambiguity factor of the volume operator in @xcite or @xcite ) provides a useful way to fix the ambiguity factor .",
    "the classical length expression in is invariant under gauge transformations of the su(2 ) group .",
    "this symmetry is preserved in the quantum theory , whence , our length operator is internal gauge invariant and hence can be defined in the internal gauge invariant hilbert space . for smooth diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 , the length operators transform covariantly .    in the expression of the length operator , @xmath242 is symmetric and positive semidefinite on @xmath243 , and thus the square root exists .",
    "hence all @xmath236 in the family @xmath234 are positive semidefinite , so the projective limit @xmath136 is a densely defined , positive semidefinite and symmetric operator which has self - adjoint extensions ( for instance , its friedrich extension ) .",
