    "entanglement  @xcite is a purely quantum feature and a central resource in quantum information and quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "its interplay with classical communication has been the subject of many investigations .",
    "to name a few : entanglement together with classical communication enables quantum teleportation  @xcite ; quantum communication assisted by entanglement provides dense coding  @xcite ; classical communication allows to simulate stronger - than - classical correlations exhibited by entangled states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , classical communication allows manipulation of entanglement in highly non - trivial ways , like in entanglement distillation  @xcite or entanglement swapping  @xcite . in these two latter cases ,",
    "classical communication can be considered a means to modify entanglement , in its `` quality '' or in its distribution among parties .    in this paper ,",
    "in which we provide both detailed proofs of the claims presented in  @xcite and some new results , we contribute to the understanding of the interplay between entanglement and classical communication , by studying fundamental tasks , or primitives , dealing with _",
    "entanglement redistribution_. in particular , we focus on the classical communication properties of multipartite operations that by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) perform said redistribution .    recently , there has been a great progress in understanding classical communication properties of quantum bipartite operations ( @xcite ) . on the one hand ,",
    "one estimates capacities of a bipartite operation : how many bits can one party send to another one , in the scenario where parties have access to many istances to the operation , which is thus considered a given resource ? on the other hand , one investigated how much classical communication is needed to perform a given bipartite operation @xcite .    in this paper we concentrate on communication properties of primitives , irrespectively of their implementation .",
    "i.e. , we assume that we deal with black - boxes which realize the task and we may not know the inner structure of the box , e.g. , we do not know the specific unitaries or projectors involved in the redistribution process . knowing only the task realized by the box",
    ", one can nonetheless ask how many bits can be sent by using the box .",
    "in contrast , one can ask what is the minimal number of bits necessary to realize a given primitive , i.e. , for an optimal box .",
    "we concentrate on entanglement redistribution - boxes , i.e. , we deal with boxes which perform entanglement swapping ( es )  @xcite , or create a ghz state from two bell states , or create a bell state from a ghz state ( figure [ fig : swappingsteps ] ) .",
    "es is a crucial ingredient of many protocols in quantum information theory .",
    "it is also one of the elements of quantum repeaters  @xcite , which enable long distance quantum communication .",
    "on the one hand we define , the _ communication cost _ ( cc ) of a _ particular",
    "_ box , i.e. , one of the many possible boxes which realize a certain primitive , as the minimal amount of communication that is required to implement . on the other hand",
    ", we define the _ communication value _ ( cv ) of the box as the minimal amount of communication that can be established with the box .",
    "we further define the cc ( cv ) of a primitive as the minimal cc ( cv ) over all boxes realizing the primitive .",
    "we will show that in general more communication has to be spent to perform a certain entanglement - redistribution , e.g. , es and creating a ghz state from two bell states , than can be established via any locc operation that realizes it .",
    "hence , these two processes are irreversible with respect to classical communication .",
    "on the other hand we will show that creating a bell state from a ghz state is reversible with respect to classical communication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definitions ] we provide the definition of the basic concepts and quantities which we consider . in section [ sec : main ] we present our main results , which concern the structural characterization of entanglement - redistribution boxes , and upper and lower bounds on cc and cv of said oxes .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "when considering bipartite and multipartite operations , we can ask whether : ( i ) they need communication  besides local operations and preshared correlations ( entanglement )  to be implemented  ; ( ii ) they may be exploited in order to communicate .",
    "we respect to the latter question , it is clear that we can distinguish _ signaling _ and _ non - signaling _ ( also known as _ causal _ ) quantum operations  @xcite , as in definition  [ def : signaling ] below , where we consider the general multipartite case involving a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 parties .",
    "it is worth noticing that there are some operations on a bipartite system , that need communication to be performed , but anyway can not be used to communicate  @xcite .",
    "[ def : signaling ] an @xmath1-partite map @xmath2 is _ signalling _ from @xmath3 to @xmath4 if there exist a state @xmath5 and two _ alphabet maps _",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , such that @xmath8)\\neq{\\operatorname{tr}}_{\\backslash j}(\\lambda\\circ\\gamma^{1}[\\rho])$ ] .",
    "otherwise , @xmath9 is said to be _ non - signalling _ from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the concept of signalling ( and non - signalling ) map can be extended to the case where we consider some partition of the parties in disjoint sets @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 . signalling and no - signalling from @xmath14 to @xmath15 are defined straightforwardly by substituting maps @xmath16 and the operation of partial trace @xmath17 in the definition above .",
    "notice that , when we group parties , the alphabet maps as well as the ability of the receiving parties to `` decode the message '' may be restricted , e.g. , to locc operations .    even though the possibility of signalling is defined in terms of an initial state which pertains to the same number of systems as the input of the map , it is possible to use further resources , i.e. , a larger ( in the number of systems ) initial state of which only a part is subject to the map , in order to enhance communication .",
    "more specifically , it is possible to feed the map with only some subsystems of an entangled state .      in",
    "@xcite a general framework for analyzing classical communication properties for bipartite operations was studied .",
    "the scenario studied is the following : alice and bob have at disposal many uses of some bipartite operation @xmath9 , and they want to take advantage of this fact to communicate classical messages one another , having possibly at disposal different amounts of pre - shared entanglement as a further resource .",
    "in particular , the authors considered the set of jointly achievable rates of classical communication from alice to bob and from bob to alice , and the rate of producing or consuming entanglement",
    ".    our analysis will differ in many ways from the one in  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , we will focus on a less general problem .",
    "first , we will consider only locc multipartite maps .",
    "second , as suggested by the structure of the entanglement - redistribution boxes given by theorem  [ thm : structure ] , we will consider only one - way capacities of such multipartite locc maps , i.e. , we will focus on optimizing only one of possibly many rates .",
    "on the other hand , we will also address the problem of the classical communication needed to realize locc maps .    in general",
    ", we will adopt two different points of view : that of the _ users _ and that of the _ providers_. from the users point of view , many copies of a bi- or multipartite operation are a resource to be consumed in order to achieve classical communication . from their point of view , the operation @xmath9 is a box , whose `` inner mechanism '' they might or might not know , i.e. , the box is a _ black - box_. users feed the box with some input and they obtain an output from it . from the providers point of view , whom we assume to",
    "be acting via locc , the operation is to be implemented , and it costs classical communication .",
    "providers act `` inside '' the box , and must perform the map @xmath9 on any possible input from the users .",
    "since our focus is on locc operations to be exploited or implemented :    * we do allow users to consume whatever amount of previously shared entanglement ;",
    "* providers can not use entanglement in order to implement @xmath9 : the only entanglement they deal with is the one fed to boxes by users .",
    "we are now ready to define the central quantities of our paper , which consist of rates and refer to the asymptotic case of many instances of boxes or tasks  @xcite    the communication value ( cv ) of a box from the user @xmath18 to the user @xmath19 is the maximal rate ( the capacity ) at which user @xmath18 can reliably send classical messages to user @xmath19 , i.e. , the number of classical bits communicated per use of the box .",
    "the communication cost ( cc ) of a box from the provider @xmath18 to the provider @xmath19 is the rate at which classical communication must be sent from the first to the second in order to implement the box .",
    "the cc and cv from @xmath18 to @xmath19 for a task are the infima of cc and cv from @xmath18 to @xmath19 over all boxes realizing the task , i.e. , the minimum amount of communication needed to realize the task , and the minimum amount of communication that we are sure it is possible to establish by means of any box that performs the task , respectively .",
    "as quantum mechanics respects causality , we have that cc  both of a single box as well as of a task  is always bigger than cv .",
    "because of the characterization of all es - boxes we will provide , the cc and the cv will be analyzed with respect to the relevant direction @xmath20 .",
    "if not differently stated , we will consider alice and bob as one party when considering the cv .",
    "this means that not only we allow communication between alice and bob , when they decode a message sent by charlie , but we furthermore allow to perform global @xmath21 quantum operations . indeed ,",
    "while the box is assumed to be ( in its implementation ) tripartite locc , this does not force the users to have the same limitation .",
    "alternatively , one could think of pre - shared entanglement between alice and bob being consumed while trying to get a signal from charlie by means of the box .",
    "the tasks we will study correspond to the redistribution of entanglement by means of locc operations .",
    "the entangled states relevant for our discussion are bipartite and tripartite : the maximal entangled epr state of two qubits ^+_x_1x_2=| ^+ ^+ |_x_1x_2,| ^+ _ x_1x_2=(| 0 _ x_1| 0 _ x_2+| 1 _ x_1| 1 _ x_2 ) and the ghz state of three qubits | ghz _",
    "x_1x_2x_3=(| 0 _ x_1| 0 _ x_2| 0 _ x_3+| 1 _ x_1| 1 _ x_2| 1 _ x_3 )",
    ". we will consider multipartite locc operations .",
    "it is well known that such operations can be written in the form of separable operations , e.g. , in the tripartite case we will consider , as : _",
    "abc[_abc]=_i a_ib_ic_i_abc a^_ib^_ic^_i,_i ( a^_ib^_ic^_i)(a_ib_ic_i)= , where we used the shorthand notation @xmath22 .    in particular , we will focus on operations which realize the three processes of redistribution of entanglement represented schematically in figure  [ fig : swappingsteps ] :    [ es ] : :    entanglement swapping :    @xmath23 [ 2epr - ghz ] : :    two epr pairs into a ghz state :    @xmath24 [ ghz - epr ] : :    a ghz state into an epr pair :    @xmath25    thus , es may be realized in two steps : 2epr - ghz first , followed by ghz - epr .    both for [ es ] and [ ghz - epr ] we refer to the @xmath21 output alone , disregarding the output system of charlie , i.e. effectively tracing it out .",
    "an locc operation is said to be a box for one of the entanglement - redistribution tasks listed above , e.g. , es , if , given the correct input , e.g. , two epr pairs between the users @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the case of es , it outputs the correct output , e.g. , an epr pair between @xmath28 ; that is , it realizes the redistribution .",
    "the attribute of being `` black '' means that , e.g. , users do not care about the inner implementation of the box , as long as it performs the corresponding task upon proper input ( see figure  [ fig : esbb ] ) . on the opposite side , providers have to deal with said inner implementation ( see figure  [ fig : esb - inside ] ) by definition .",
    "we obtain two main results .",
    "first , we characterize completely the inner structure of entanglement - redistribution boxes .",
    "second , using said characterization , we are able to compute bounds for cc and cv of both boxes and tasks , showing in particular a fundamental irreversibility regarding classical communication for entanglement swapping : entanglement swapping costs more classical communication than it can signal .    as an introduction to our main results ,",
    "let us make some immediate observations about the communication properties of entanglement swapping .",
    "we notice that any es box is _ signaling _ with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "let us choose @xmath30 as the initial state and the identity and the measurement in the computational basis as charlie s two alphabet maps .",
    "if charlie applies the identity then alice and bob obtain @xmath31 as the output of the box .",
    "if charlie performs the measurement in computational basis , then he destroys all the entanglement between the parties and alice and bob obtain a separable state as the output of the box .",
    "let us consider a specific example of es - box .",
    "it is well known that quantum teleportation in particular realizes entanglement swapping .",
    "hence , as our box we take _ any _ locc teleportation protocol  @xcite from charlie to alice .",
    "cv of this box is equal to @xmath32  @xcite . in order to signal two bits from charlie to alice",
    "the parties take @xmath33 as the initial state where @xmath34 is local ancilla of alice that is maximally entangled with @xmath35 .",
    "charlie can rotate locally the pair @xmath36 into one of four orthogonal bell state .",
    "after the box is applied this bell state is held only by alice .",
    "if we choose the standard teleportation protocol , constiting of a bell measurement at the sender followed by a proper unitary rotation at the receiver , the cc is 2 . for any other locc teleportation protocols , cc is greater or equal to 2 , as can not be less than cv because of causuality  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we will show that there are es boxes which have cv equal to @xmath37 .",
    "we will also show that every es - box has cc greater or equal to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , there are es - boxes which exhibit communication irreversibility .",
    "the first of our main results is a complete characterization of the structure of all entanglement - redistribution boxes .",
    "we prove that all the kinds of entanglement redistribution we are analyzing , es , 2epr - ghz and ghz - epr , are essentially one - way protocols : the provider charlie measures his part of the system , and communicates the result of the measurement to alice and/or bob , who then apply a rotation to their systems accordingly to the result they have been communicated .",
    "[ thm : structure ] any entanglement redistribution box @xmath38 is of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are unitary operations , and @xmath42 depend on the kind of box in the following way :    [ es ] : :    @xmath43 are    rank - one measurement operators , with    @xmath44 normalized maximally entangled    states of charlie s particles , which satisfy    @xmath45    for es box ; [ 2epr - ghz ] : :    @xmath46    are rank - two measurement operators , with    @xmath47 , and    @xmath48    for all @xmath49 , satisfying    @xmath50 ; [ ghz - epr ] : :    @xmath51 are    rank - one measurement operators , with    @xmath52 ,    which satisfy    @xmath53 .",
    "the proof consists of two parts . in the first part _ ( i ) _ we prove that alice and bob can not perform non - unitary operations . in the second part _",
    "( ii ) _ we find the conditions which have to be satisfied by charlie s operators .    _",
    "( i ) _ we will prove this part by contradiction .",
    "every locc protocol corresponds to rounds of local operations followed by classical communication .",
    "let us suppose that alice is the first , between her and bob , to perform an operation different from an isometry , and that this happens at round @xmath54   or @xmath55 , i.e. either alice acts first or after charlie . ] .",
    "after such an operation by alice , we allow bob and charlie to join , so that the protocol may continue as an @xmath56 _ bipartite _ locc protocol . if something is impossible even allowing this , then it is a fortiori impossible by continuing with a _",
    "tripartite _ locc protocol , as it actually is .",
    "we may think of one step of any locc protocol as of the application by one party of trace preserving maps , which ( may ) depend on the result @xmath49 of the previous steps , of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are classical registers  locally available to all the parties  indicating which kraus operator is applied , and @xmath59 are kraus operators that may depend on the previous results , i.e. on the previous state @xmath49 of some classical registers .",
    "therefore , we can describe the evolution of the branches of the protocol , with an initial pure state maintaining its purity in each branch , and we can consistently analyze the intermediate steps of the protocol .",
    "the relevant , total channel is obtained by tracing out the classical registers .    before the action of alice , the state @xmath60 of the system ( the relevant system plus the classical registers ) can be described as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and we indicate explicitly that we will consider entanglement properties    with respect to the @xmath56 cut .",
    "since we start from the state @xmath63 , the schmidt rank of each @xmath64 can not exceed @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the entanglement of formation  @xcite @xmath65 must be @xmath37 , otherwise alice and bob ( who is together with charlie ) can not obtain at the end a maximally entangled state , as required by es . using the fact that the states @xmath66 have support on locally orthogonal subspaces thanks to the classical registers , we obtain @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , and @xmath69 the von neumann entropy .",
    "we conclude that each state @xmath64 is effectively a maximally entangled state of two qubits , and @xmath70 ( on its local support ) , with @xmath71 the @xmath72-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "according to the previous remark , alice s action on the state of the system is @xmath73 entanglement of formation becomes @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "alice s operation @xmath76 can not be considered as a ( probabilistic ) isometry   if at least one kraus operator @xmath77 of hers does not act as an isometry ( up to a coefficient of proportionality ) on the local support . in such case @xmath78",
    "is not proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , therefore @xmath81 .",
    "any further ( @xmath56)-bipartite locc processing of the state can not increase @xmath82 , thus alice and bob can not obtain at the end a maximally entangled state , and we reach a contradiction with the es requirement . therefore , neither alice nor bob can perform any other operation but isometries .",
    "since their output subsystems correspond to their input subsystems , such isometries are indeed unitaries .    _",
    "( ii ) _ in all three cases charlie is initially maximally entangled with alice and bob with respect to his local support , i.e. , two - qubit dimensional for es and 2epr - ghz , and one - qubit dimensional for ghz - epr .",
    "therefore , the action of the kraus operator @xmath83 leads to the creation of a state whose schmidt rank in the @xmath84 cut corresponds to the matrix rank of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 must have rank one , i.e. , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 a normalized state , for es and ghz - epr boxes , and rank two , i.e. , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , for all @xmath49 , for any 2epr - ghz box .    [ es ] : :    the output state of alice s and bob s subsystem corresponding to a    given @xmath83 has the same schmidt coefficients as    @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we see that alice and    bob may obtain a maximally entangled state only if    @xmath90 is maximally entangled .",
    "[ 2epr - ghz ] : :    it is immediate to check that    @xmath91 ,    with @xmath92 having the complex    conjugate coefficients of @xmath93 in the    computational basis in which the epr pairs are defined . in order for    this state to be proportional to a ghz state , it must hold    @xmath94    with    @xmath48 ,    and @xmath95 .",
    "[ ghz - epr ] : :    let us suppose that    @xmath96 .",
    "then the resulting state @xmath97    of alice s and bob s subsystem , when normalized , has schmidt    coefficients @xmath98 and    @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we see that alice and bob    may obtain a maximally entangled state only if    @xmath100      we can now address the problem of the cc of es - boxes .",
    "the standard form for es - boxes of theorem  [ thm : structure ] tells us that all es - boxes can be realized with only @xmath20 classical communication , which is used by charlie to make alice and bob aware of the result of his measurement , so that they can apply the correct local unitary rotations .    in order to provide a lower bound on cc",
    ", we will need the entropic quantities @xmath101 ( conditional entropy ) , @xmath102 ( mutual information ) , @xmath103 ( conditional mutual information ) , where for brevity we use the notation @xmath104 , etc .",
    ", and the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : deltas ] consider an ensemble @xmath105 , and the corresponding average state @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the average increase of mutual information , and @xmath109 is the average decrease of entropy , when alice and bob come to know the index of the state they actually share among the ones in the ensemble .",
    "let us introduce a state @xmath110 , with orthogonal states @xmath111 , and calculate @xmath112 for said state :    i(a : b|r ) & = s(ar)+s(br)-s(r)-s(abr ) + & = s(_ip^i_a^i|ii|)+s(_ip^i_b^i|ii|)-s(_ip^i|ii|)-s(_ip^i_ab^i|ii| ) + & = h(\\{p^i})+ _ ip^is(_a^i)+ h(\\{p^i})+ _ ip^is(_b^i)-h(\\{p^i})- h(\\{p^i})- _ ip^is(_ab^i ) + & = _",
    "ip^i(s(_a^i)+s(_b^i)-s(_ab^i ) ) + & = _",
    "ip^ii(_ab^i ) .",
    "thus , we have obtained the expression @xmath113 for the average increase of mutual information .",
    "let us further calculate @xmath114 for @xmath115 :    i(ab : r)&=s(_ab)+s(_r)-s(_abr ) + & = s(_ab)+h(\\{p^i})-h(\\{p^i})-_ip^is(_ab ) + & = s(_ab)-_ip^is(^i_ab ) .",
    "therefore , the average decrease of entropy is given by @xmath116 we are now ready to show that @xmath107 : @xmath117-[s(a)+s(r)-s(ar)]\\\\ & = -i(a : r)-i(b : r)\\\\ & \\leq 0 \\end{split}\\ ] ] the last inequality holds because of non - negativity of mutual information .",
    "since charlie has to tell alice and bob the result of his measurement , the number of bits sent by charlie to alice and bob per each realization of a es - box can not be less than the shannon entropy @xmath118 of the probability distribution of the outcomes of charlie .",
    "this line of reasoning leads to the following cc bounds .",
    "the following bounds hold for any box realizing the corresponding task :    [ es ] : :    @xmath119 ; [ 2epr - ghz ] : :    @xmath120 ; [ ghz - epr ] : :    @xmath120 .    starting with the right input , before charlie s measurement , the reduced state @xmath121 is the maximally mixed state @xmath122 for both an es - box and a 2epr - ghz box , while it is a maximally classically correlated state @xmath123 for a ghz - epr box .",
    "the mutual information is @xmath124 in the first two cases and @xmath125 in the last case .",
    "after charlie s measurement , alice and bob have an ensemble @xmath105 . each @xmath126 is a maximally entangled state for es - box or ghz - epr box and a maximally classically correlated state for 2epr - ghz box .",

    "we have    h(\\{p_i})&=s(_ab)-_ip^is(_ab^i ) + & _ ip^ii(_ab^i)-i(_ab ) .",
    "hence , we obtain the lower bounds @xmath129 for es box , and @xmath130 for both 2epr - ghz box and ghz - epr box .",
    "the protocols which achieve these bounds are :    [ es ] : :    standard teleportation map : bell measurement of charlie , and    conditional pauli rotation on alice and/or bob ; [ 2epr - ghz ] : :    charlie s measurement    @xmath131 ,    and conditional unitary operation on bob s qubit    @xmath132 ; [ ghz - epr ] : :    charlie s measurement    @xmath133 ,    and conditional unitary operation on bob s qubit    @xmath134 .",
    "thus , we have obtained lower bounds for the communication cost of any entanglement redistribution boxes .",
    "furthermore , we proved that such bounds are tight , in the sense that there exist boxes that require exactly that amount of @xmath20 communication to be realized .",
    "thus , @xmath135 for both 2epr - ghz and ghz - epr , and @xmath136 for es .",
    "we now look for lower bounds on how useful to establish communication among the users a box is . in order to do this",
    ", we will provide schemes to exploit the entanglement redistribution boxes to communicate .",
    "let us remark that one may consider two different scenarios .",
    "in the first one , the box is really black to the users , i.e. , they do not know which box , among all the possible ones realizing a particular task , they are dealing with . in the second one , the users actually know which particular box realizing a certain task they have been provided with , so they can better exploit it for communication . in the latter case ,",
    "the box might not be considered to be `` black '' , as users know its content .",
    "anyway , on the one hand , having bounds which are valid for any box realizing a certain task , implies that each black box comes with a certain potential for communication , which can be `` activated '' if at a certain point the users come to know which box they are dealing with ",
    "e.g. , through process tomography . on the other hand ,",
    "as it will turn out , the protocols we devise to communicate do depend only on the defining process of entanglement redistribution , and on the structural characterization of theorem  [ thm : structure ] .",
    "thus , the same protocol works for any box realizing a precise task , even if it is black .",
    "the following theorem provides a lower bound for cv for es and ghz - epr boxes .",
    "[ thm : lowerboundcv ] any es - box or ghz - epr box has cv at least equal to 1 .",
    "we use two epr pairs @xmath137 as an input to the box . in order to communicate to alice and",
    "bob charlie applies one of two possible unitary operations , @xmath138 or @xmath139 , to his part of the input , before the action of the box .",
    "we can write the result of the action of a es - box on two epr pairs in the following way    [ eq : esout ] ^+_ab&=tr_c_abc(^+_ac_1^+_bc_2 ) + _ abc(^+_ac_1^+_bc_2)&=_iu_a^iu_b^ie_c^i^+_ac_1^+_bc_2 u_a^iu_b^ie_c^i    similarly , the the action of an ghz - epr box on an input given by the ghz state is [ eq : ghz - eprout ]    ^+_ab&=tr_c_abc(|ghz ghz|_abc ) + _ abc(|ghz",

    "anyway , consistently with the idea of obtaining an upper bound , we apply the formula for eaccqc by pretending that charlie has complete control over all the input , not only on his subsystem , so that it reads [ eq : eaccqc ] c(_abc)= ( s(_abc ) + s(_abc(_abc ) ) -s((_abc_e)(_abce ) ) ) , where @xmath168 is any purification of @xmath169 , @xmath170 is the identity map , and the maximum runs over all possible input states @xmath169 . for our channel",

    "we know that any es ( ghz - epr ) box has communication value at least 1 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "moreover @xmath178 does not depend on charlie s action @xmath179 , which means that the map is @xmath180 _",

    "recall that the only constraint for @xmath218 is that they sum up to 1 .",
    "now we will use lemma  [ lem : eaccequalscc ] ( proven below ) , which tells us that , if a channel is of the form @xmath219 , where @xmath220 projects onto abelian algebra , then its classical capacity is equal to its entanglement assisted classical capacity . in our case @xmath220 is ( double ) twirling , hence it projects onto abelian algebra spanned by projectors @xmath221 .",
    "it follows that it is enough to compute holevo capacity of the channel ( which is additive in this case ) .",

    "is given by c_e()=__eai((_e_a)(_ea ) ) , where the supremum runs over all states @xmath236 , with @xmath174 being of the same dimension as @xmath234 ( it is actually enough to consider pure states ) .",

    "ea=_i p_i |i_ei| ^i_a for any size of system @xmath174 ( via caratheodory theorem it is known that a finite one is enough , but it is not important for the moment ) . since clearly @xmath238 , it is enough to show the converse inequality . to this end",
    ", we shall show that for any state @xmath236 one can build a c - q state @xmath237 such that after action of channel , the latter state has no smaller mutual information than the former one .",

    "since this state is preserved by @xmath220 we get that c_e()=(_e_a)(_ea ) , where the supremum is taken over @xmath236 of the form ( [ eq : cq - state2 ] ) .",
    "thus it is enough to optimize over c - q states , which implies that the supremum is equal to unassisted capacity , due to ( [ eq : clas - cap ] ) .    to summarize , we have obtained , that for 2epr - ghz box we have 0.3219 cv0.469782 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the communication properties of entanglement redistribution tasks , e.g. , entanglement swapping ( es ) , realized by means of locc protocols . by `` communication properties '' of said tasks , we mean , on the one hand , the amount of classical communication that is needed to perform the redistribution  its communication cost . on the other hand , we studied the communication value of the task , i.e. , the amount of communication that is allowed by the bi- and multi - partite locc operation that realizes the redistribution .",
    "these two quantities may be thought as corresponding to two different points of view : that of providers and that of users , respectively",
    ". providers are requested to realize the right locc operation : upon the correct input , i.e. , the correct initial distribution of entanglement , such entanglement is redistributed `` as promised '' .",
    "users may instead feed whatever input to the redistribution operation , and in this way they may try to use the entanglement - redistribution `` machinery '' , which is given to them by the providers , for a different aim than `` just '' entanglement redistribution , e.g. , to communicate among themselves . on the one hand ,",
    "the communication cost of the redistribution is a quantity of practical relevance ; on the other hand , its communication value tells us whether the classical communication needed to implement the redistribution is , in a sense , irreversibly spent .",
    "we showed that it is possible to estimate both the communication value and the communication cost irrespectively of the particular implementation of the redistribution process .",
    "indeed , it is often useful to formulate information processing in terms of primitives rather than via specific realizations ( e.g. a particular protocol ) .",
    "the first step in studying the communication properties of entanglement redistribution has been a complete characterization of the structure of the locc operations involved . using this characterization",
    ", we discovered a phenomenon of _ irreversibility _ for es : it needs 2 bits to be implemented and it can signal 1 bit .",
    "in contrast quantum teleportation needs 2 bits to be implemented and can also signal 2 bits . in this sense , es is a weaker primitive than quantum teleportation .",
    "one can show that for @xmath72-dimensional system the gap between cc and cv for es  thus , between es and teleportation  is even greater .",
    "namely , one needs @xmath241 bits to implement es , while in general it can be exploited to signal only 1 bit . as a primitive , es",
    "may be split into two subprimitives , or intermediate steps ( figure [ fig : swappingsteps ] ) : the transformation of two epr pairs into a ghz state , and of the latter into an epr pair between any two subsystems .",
    "we proved that both the cc and cv of the second ( sub)primitive are equal to @xmath37 , so that such primitive may be considered _",
    "reversible _ from the point of view of classical communication .",
    "with respect to the first subprimitive , there exists a box which has cc equal to @xmath37 and cv strictly less than @xmath37 and strictly greater than @xmath183",
