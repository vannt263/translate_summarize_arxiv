    "absorption features due to interstellar ices are observed in near- and mid - infrared spectra of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "generally , ices are formed on the surface of dust in dense molecular clouds ( @xmath7 @xmath8 10  k , @xmath9 ) , forming ice mantles . in a near - infrared ( nir )",
    "spectrum , we can observe deep absorption features particularly due to @xmath2 ice at 3.05 @xmath1 and @xmath3 ice at 4.27 @xmath1 .",
    "these interstellar ices have many pieces of information on the interstellar environment . among various ices ,",
    "@xmath3 ice is one of the most important ones as a probe of the interstellar environment .",
    "that is because @xmath3 ice is a secondary product unlike @xmath2 and @xmath10 ices which are primarily formed on dust grains . a formation process of @xmath3 ice indicated by the recent model and experimental analyses ( garrod & pauly 2011 ; noble et al .",
    "2011 ) is as follows : @xmath11 related to the formation process , both energetic and non - energetic ones are proposed . as an energetic process",
    ", watanabe & kouchi ( 2002 ) showed that @xmath3 ice is produced from a @xmath2-co ice mixture by uv radiation , based on the laboratory experiments .",
    "alternatively , oba et al .",
    "( 2010 ) experimentally demonstrated a non - energetic process , in which the abundance of @xmath3 ice varies with dust temperature since the process is a grain surface reaction and a high dust temperature changes the mobility of the oh radical .",
    "thus , these processes suggest that the abundance of @xmath3 ice may have information on the uv radiation environment or the dust temperature .",
    "additionally , ices have different sublimation temperatures ( e.g. 90 k and 50 k for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ; tielens 2005 ) .",
    "therefore we can estimate the thermal history of dust from the presence or absence of ices .",
    "hence , interstellar @xmath3 ice is a useful tracer of the interstellar environment .",
    "however , studies of @xmath3 ice , especially in nearby galaxies , have not yet been intensively performed because @xmath3 ice is not observable with ground - based telescopes due to the atmospheric absorption .",
    "the detections of @xmath3 ice in our galaxy are reported for some young stellar objects ( gibb et al .",
    "2004 ) and several regions of the diffuse ism ( e.g , taurus : bergin et al .",
    "2005 , ophiuchus : teixeira & emerson 1999 , and ic  5146 : chiar et al .",
    "2011 ) . with _ infrared space observatory _ , spoon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected the absorption features due to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , co , and xcn ices in the nearby galaxy ngc  4945 .",
    "these previous observations were performed only for discrete spots . in order to investigate @xmath3 ice more effectively , it is valuable to perform mapping observations of ices on a large scale .",
    "spectroscopy with the @xmath0/_infrared camera _",
    "( @xmath12 ; murakami et al .",
    "2007 ; ohyama et al . 2007 ) enables us to efficiently study ices in the nir ( 2.55.0 @xmath1 ) , which is unique in terms of continuously covering the wavelength range with high sensitivity .",
    "yamagishi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed the nir spectra with @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices in the central @xmath8600 pc region of ngc  253 ; the spatial distribution of @xmath2 ice is found to be similar to that of @xmath3 ice . in this paper , we present the result for m  82 .",
    "using the nir spectra of m  82 , yamagishi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) already discussed variations of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) 3.3 @xmath1 feature and the aliphatic sub - features at 3.43.6 @xmath1 in the galactic disk and halo regions . here",
    "we focus on @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices to investigate their spatial distribution in the central @xmath81 kpc region .",
    "unlike the case of ngc  253 , we clearly reveal difference in the spatial distribution between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices , which gives physical implications for the ice - forming interstellar environment in m  82 .",
    "in all the observations , we used a grism spectroscopic mode ( ohyama et al .",
    "2007 ) to obtain 2.55.0 @xmath1 spectra .",
    "a summary of the observations and sub - slit apertures used in the present study is listed in table  1 , where regions a , b , and c are those defined in yamagishi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , covering the central @xmath81 kpc region at a distance of m  82 ( 3.53 mpc ; karachentsev et al .",
    "the basic reduction processes are the same as those in yamagishi et al .",
    "depending on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios , we divided the slit aperture area into sub - apertures as listed in table  1 , and derived a spectrum from each sub - aperture .",
    "we shifted the slit sub - aperture position by 1 pixel ( 1@xmath1346 ) one after the other to consecutively derive spectra along the slit .",
    "two independent observations were performed for region a , and the two spectra are combined to improve the s / n ratios . finally , smoothing with a boxcar kernel of @xmath14 @xmath1 was applied to each spectrum . as a result",
    ", we extract 77 spectra in total .",
    "we consider errors given by the pipeline plus wavelength - dependent background noise ; the latter errors are evaluated as 1@xmath15 standard deviations every 0.2 @xmath1 wavelength range for 82 spectra of the blank sky .",
    "figure  1 shows examples of the spectra extracted from the center of m  82 , which reveal variations of the spectra in the direction to the south east from the galactic center .",
    "the intensities of the spectra monotonically decrease with the distance from the galactic center .",
    "spectral features due to @xmath2 ice , @xmath3 ice , the pah 3.3 @xmath1 feature , aliphatic sub - features at 3.4 - 3.6 @xmath1 , br@xmath5 at 4.05 @xmath1 , br@xmath6 at 2.63@xmath1 , and pf@xmath6 at 4.65 @xmath1 are clearly detected .",
    "as for the ices , @xmath2 ice is significantly detected in all the observed regions .",
    "in contrast , @xmath3 ice is not detected at regions distant from the galactic center , where @xmath2 ice is still clearly detected . in order to quantify the spatial distribution of the ices",
    ", we evaluate the column densities of the ices and create the column density maps using all the extracted spectra .",
    "figures  2a and 2b show the resultant column density maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices . in order to evaluate absorption features due to @xmath2 ice",
    ", we fit spectral continuum and emission / absorption features simultaneously using the wavelength ranges of 2.554.20 , 4.354.40 , and 4.904.95 @xmath1 .",
    "we adopted lorentzian functions to fit the pah 3.3 @xmath1 feature and aliphatic sub - feature at 3.4 @xmath1 , and gaussian functions to fit br@xmath5 , br@xmath6 , pf@xmath16 , and aliphatic sub - feature at 3.5 @xmath1 .",
    "the former and latter functions were used for resolved and unresolved spectral features , respectively . as a continuum component",
    ", we used a multi - temperature ( 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 , and 3200 k ) blackbody model which represents warm dust emission and photospheric emission from cool stars .",
    "the absorption feature due to @xmath2 ice is represented by a gaussian function . in evaluating @xmath3 ice",
    ", we used only a wavelength range of 4.124.42 @xmath1 to estimate local continuum levels for the relatively narrow feature as accurately as possible .",
    "we used simple linear and gaussian functions as continuum and absorption , respectively .",
    "the column density , @xmath17 , of each ice is then derived from the equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the band strength of each ice feature measured in a laboratory , an optical depth derived from the fitting , and a wavenumber ( @xmath22 ) , respectively .",
    "the band strengths of @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath24 are used for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices , respectively ( gerakines et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this calculation",
    ", we assume that the continuum and emission features are in the background and absorbed by the ices . for the regions with significant detection of the ices ( @xmath26 ) , we created the spectral maps of the column densities of the ices .",
    "figures  2a and 2b indicate that the ices are abundant near the galactic center .",
    "however the spatial distribution of the ices is clearly different from that of pahs ( kaneda et al . 2010 ) , although both are thought to represent the neutral ism .",
    "the spatial distribution of pahs has a very sharp peak in the galactic center , and it is close to symmetry with respect to the galactic center and disk . whereas the spatial distribution of the ices is biased toward the northeast from the center .",
    "such biased distribution of the ism in the center of m  82 was also reported in the @xmath27 ( @xmath28=10 ) emission ( walter et al .",
    "2002 ) . in fig .",
    "2c , we compare the spatial distribution of the total ( @xmath2+@xmath3 ) ice with that of co. the figure shows that the spatial distribution of the total ice is globally correlated with that of co and the peak position of the ice corresponds to the bright ridge seen in the co map .",
    "thus , it is clear that the spatial distribution of ices is similar to that of molecular clouds rather than that of pahs , reflecting that ices are mainly present in dense molecular clouds which are observed in the co emission , but not in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) which are observed in the pah emission .    in figs .",
    "2a and 2b , we also find a clear difference in the spatial distribution of the ices ; @xmath2 ice is significantly detected in all the observed regions , while @xmath3 ice is detected only in smaller areas near the galactic center .",
    "these trends are consistent with the changes of the spectra seen in fig .  1 .",
    "in the previous study of the ices in ngc  253 , there is no clear difference in the spatial distribution between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices ( yamagishi et al .",
    "our result for the first time reveals variations in @xmath4 ice abundance ratio on a galactic scale , suggesting that the ice - forming interstellar environment changes within a galaxy .",
    "we quantitatively examine the relation between the abundance of the ices and the properties of the ism using the spectral features in the nir .",
    "figure  3a shows the column densities of the total ice plotted against the pah 3.3 @xmath1 feature intensity .",
    "the figure shows a rather loose correlation ( @xmath29 for independent 14 regions with significant detection of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices ) as can also be expected from fig .  2 .",
    "thus it reconfirms that the ices are not mainly present in pdrs .",
    "we also evaluate the amount of the ism via the interstellar extinction .",
    "figure  3b shows the abundance of the total ice plotted against br@xmath6/br@xmath5 ratios and @xmath30 . in the conversion from br@xmath6/br@xmath5 ratios to @xmath30 ,",
    "we assume an extinction law in the nir of @xmath31 ( landini et al . 1984 ) , total - to - selective extinction ratio , @xmath32 , of 3.1 , and the intrinsic line ratio in case b , temperature of @xmath33  k , and electron density of @xmath34 @xmath35 ( storey & hummer 1995 ) . by using background stars for a dark cloud in our galaxy , whittet et al .",
    "( 1988 ; 2007 ) reported a tight correlation between @xmath30 and column densities of the ices , which is also plotted in fig .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , however , we find no clear correlation between them ( @xmath36 for independent 13 regions with significant detection of br@xmath5 , br@xmath6 , @xmath2 ice , and @xmath3 ice ) , which suggests that ice - forming clouds do not significantly contribute to obscuring the observed hydrogen recombination lines ; the corresponding hii regions are likely to be located in the foreground of the ice - forming clouds",
    ". then the column densities of the ices can be underestimated if the hii regions contribute to the continuum emission via free - free emission . assuming that 50% of the continuum emission comes from the foreground , we confirm that the column densities of the both @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices in each spectrum increase by factors of 2.12.4 , but without significantly changing their relative abundances .",
    "we examine the difference in the spatial distribution between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices .",
    "figure  3c shows the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios plotted against the pah 3.3 @xmath1 intensities . in the figure",
    ", we find that there is a tight correlation between them ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the spatial distribution of the pahs has a sharp peak and monotonically decreases from the galactic center .",
    "thus the result suggests that the spatial distribution of the ices is clearly different between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices , and the abundance of @xmath3 ice relative to @xmath2 ice decreases significantly with the galactocentric distance .",
    "here it is notable that the @xmath4 ratios are strongly correlated with the pah intensities , whereas the total ice column densities are not ( fig .",
    "3a ) , indicating that @xmath3 ice is efficiently formed in the galactic center .    what causes the change in the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios ?",
    "figure  3d shows the ice abundance ratios plotted against the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 flux ratios . in the figure , we find a negative correlation between the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios and the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios ( @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) ; the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios are high in hii - dominated regions , while they are small in pdr - dominated regions . since the minimum photon energy to ionize hydrogen ( @xmath40 13.6 ev ) is higher than that to excite pahs ( @xmath41 13.6 ev ) , contribution from massive stars to the uv radiation field",
    "are likely to reflect the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios .",
    "then the result implies that massive stars are important to enhance the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios . the galactic center of m  82",
    "is indeed characterized by intense starburst ( westmoquette et al .",
    "2007 ; keto et al . 1999 ) , which may cause the high @xmath4 ice abundance ratios in the galactic center .    as for the formation processes of @xmath3 ice ,",
    "energetic processes are favorable in m  82 rather than non - energetic ones , because @xmath3 ice formation is enhanced by the intense radiation environment ( fig .",
    "however we should note that interstellar uv photons can not penetrate into dense molecular clouds , where ices are formed .",
    "even in such a situation , uv photons can be induced by cosmic - rays penetrating deep inside clouds through their interactions with molecular hydrogen ( prasad & tarafdar 1983 ) .",
    "although the acceleration process of cosmic - rays has not yet been fully understood , it is likely that many supernova remnants due to the starburst activities increase the cosmic - ray energy density in the galactic center .",
    "in fact , in our galaxy , significant increases in cosmic - ray ionization rate are reported for several molecular clouds near the galactic center and some supernova remnants ( goto et al .",
    "2008 ; indriolo et al .",
    "2010 ; indriolo & mccall 2012 ; geballe & oka 2010 ) , which support our idea . in fig .",
    "3d , the data points for ngc  253 are also plotted against the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios . from the figure",
    ", we find that they are distributed in a narrower range of the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios than for m  82 , which can explain why no significant variations in the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios were observed for ngc  253",
    "( yamagishi et al . 2011 ) .",
    "finally , for comparison with more intense starburst galaxies , we re - analyzed the @xmath0 nir spectra of 5 ( ultra)luminous galaxies ( ngc  34 , cgcg  436 - 030 , eso  507-g070 , arp  193 , and arp  220 ; imanishi et al .",
    "2010 ; lee et al .",
    "the resultant @xmath4 ice abundance and pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios are in ranges of 0.080.17 and 6.719.2 , respectively , which follow the trend in fig .",
    "3d , but in similar ranges to those for m  82",
    ". this may suggest similarity in the hardness of the uv radiation field between m  82 and these galaxies as a whole .",
    "with @xmath0 , we have obtained the spatially - resolved near - infrared ( 2.5  5.0 @xmath1 ) spectra for the nearby starburst galaxy m  82 .",
    "we clearly detect spectral features due to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices , the pah 3.3 @xmath1 feature , br@xmath5 , and br@xmath6 .",
    "based on the column density maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices created from the spectral fitting , we show a significant difference in the spatial distribution between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ices on a galactic scale ; @xmath3 ice is more concentrated near the galactic center . we find a strong negative correlation between the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios and the pah 3.3 @xmath1/br@xmath5 ratios , indicating that the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios are high in hii - dominated regions , while they are small in pdr - dominated regions .",
    "the result suggests that massive stars are important to enhance the @xmath4 ice abundance ratios .",
    "increase of cosmic - ray induced uv photons due to the intensive starburst activities may cause the high @xmath4 ice abundance ratios in the galactic center .",
