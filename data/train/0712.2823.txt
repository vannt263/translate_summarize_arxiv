    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of co white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "because of their high luminosity together with a tight relation between the maximum brightness and decline rate of the light curve ( lc ) , sne ia are one of the most accurate distance indicators ( e.g. , phillips 1993 ; riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; knop et al . 2003 ; riess et al . 2004 ; astier et al . 2006 ; wood - vasey et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the homogeneity of the lc , optical spectra of sne ia are also rather homogeneous .",
    "the ratio of two lines in spectra at maximum correlates well with the sn luminosity ( nugent et al .",
    "the width of the fe emission line in the nebular spectra also correlates with the lc decline rate ( mazzali et al .",
    "these works show that the spectral properties both at maximum brightness and at the nebular phases are determined primarily by the maximum luminosity",
    ".    however , recent studies using large samples revealed large diversity in the early spectra of sne ia , in particular in the line velocities ( see e.g. , hatano et al .",
    "2000 ; benetti et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter b05 ; branch et al .",
    "b05 divided sne ia into three groups according to the post - maximum evolution of the @xmath06355 line velocity .",
    "high velocity gradient ( hvg ) sne have a large line velocity that decreases rapidly after maximum .",
    "on the other hand , low velocity gradient ( lvg ) sne have a lower velocity with a slower post - maximum evolution ( see fig . 1 in b05 ) .",
    "hvg and lvg sne have similar maximum luminosities , implying that line velocity is independent of luminosity or lc shape ( see fig . 3 in hachinger , mazzali & benetti 2006 ) .",
    "faint sne are characterized by a lower luminosity and a low line velocity , whose evolution is comparable to that of lvg sne .    the origin of the spectral diversity is not yet fully understood , reflecting uncertainties on the explosion mechanism . despite general consensus that burning starts as a subsonic deflagration ( nomoto , sugimoto & neo 1976 ; nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 ) , it is still unclear whether or not a transition to a supersonic detonation ( khokhlov 1991b ) occurs . in recent years , the explosion mechanism has been studied by detailed numerical simulations free from spherically symmetry ( e.g. , reinecke , hillebrandt , & niemeyer 2002 ; gamezo et al .",
    "2003 ; plewa , calder & lamb 2004 ; rpke & hillebrandt 2005 ; gamezo , khokhlov & oran 2005 ) .",
    "early phase spectra are an unique tool to investigate the state of the outer layers of the ejecta , i.e. , the final fate of the burning front .",
    "furthermore , as diversity in line velocities is largest at pre - maximum phases , modeling spectra at these epochs is likely to yield clues as to the origins of this diversity .",
    "although several studies focussed on spectral diversity at maximum light ( e.g. bongard et al . 2006 ; branch et al . 2006 ; hachinger et al .",
    "2006 ) , only few have addressed pre - maximum spectra ( e.g. mazzali et al . 1993 , fisher et al . 1997 ; mazzali 2001 ; branch et al .",
    "this is mostly due to the lack of very early data , which stems from the difficulty in discovering sne well before maximum . in order to remedy this situation ,",
    "the european supernova collaboration ( esc ) has endeavored to gather very early spectra of nearby sne ia .",
    "one of the most interesting results of very early sn ia spectroscopy is the possible presence of unburned carbon in the outer layers .",
    "this may be a critical signature of the outer extent of burning .",

    "our results show that the near - photospheric abundance of fe - group elements is not smaller in hvg than in lvg , even though the photospheric velocity is higher in hvg by @xmath155 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this might imply that hvg sne have more fe - group elements if the metal abundance is a decreasing function of radius ( velocity ) .",
    "therefore , the abundances of fe - group elements in the outer layers can be a cause of spectral diversity , while differences in the kinetic energy or the progenitor mass are less likely . to confirm this hypothesis ,",
    "the metal abundance in the spectra of lvg with @xmath156 km  s@xmath2  should be investigated with earlier spectra .",
    "high - velocity features ( @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 ) are seen in both h&k and in the ir triplet . except for sn 2003cg , hvfs",
    "are not present in synthetic spectra based on w7 .",
    "they can be reproduced using the dd density structure and a relatively large ca abundance .",
    "alternatively , they can be also explained by an enhancement in density of the outer layer ( @xmath157 km  s@xmath2 ) of a factor of 4 from the w7 value assuming some h ( @xmath158% in mass fraction ) in this region .",
    "interaction with csm may produce the latter situation ; mixing of h into the ejecta increases the fraction by a factor of 5 - 10 as it favors recombination ( mazzali et al .",
    "2005a ) .    the profiles of the ir triplet show variations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ca ] ) . in hvg",
    "sne ( blue lines ) , the profile is round and the high - velocity component tends to blend with the photospheric component . in lvg",
    "sne , on the other hand , the profiles are less blended because of the weakness of the photospheric component ( green lines , see also sn 2003kf in mazzali et al .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the high @xmath159 and the low @xmath8 of lvg sne .",
    "the high temperature suppresses and lines near the photosphere , and the low photospheric velocity makes the position of the photospheric component redder . the combination of these two effects results in a weaker and redder photospheric absorption , so that the high - velocity component becomes more detached in lvg sne .",
    "the strength of the high - velocity component also varies from sn to sn .",
    "as our models show , this is not a temperature effect , because the temperature in the outer region is similar in all cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ion ] ) .",
    "although we could reproduce the strength of the hvf increasing the ca abundance , the abundances that are required show a large spread ( of a factor of 100 ; table [ tab : abun ] ) .",
    "this diversity may be a line - of - sight effect if hvfs are caused by aspherical structures , like a torus or clumps ( tanaka et al .",
    "2006 ) , as also suggested by the high polarization level of the feature ( wang et al . 2003 ; kasen et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the very strong , broad blue wing of the @xmath06355 absorption in sne 2002bo , 2002dj and 2001el is not perfectly explained by our synthetic spectra ( figures [ fig:02bo ] , [ fig:02dj ] and [ fig:01el ] ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of hvfs in as well as in lines , although the velocity of the blue edge of the absorption is lower than that of the lines ( figures [ fig : si ] and [ fig : ca ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , sne 2002er , 2003cg and 2003du lack this feature ( figures [ fig:02er ] , [ fig:03cg ] , and [ fig:03du ] ) .",
    "the origin of hvfs is debated ( e.g. , hatano et al .",
    "1999 ; wang et al . 2003 ; thomas et al . 2004 ; gerardy et al . 2004",
    "; mazzali 2005a ; kasen & plewa 2005 ; tanaka et al .",
    "the difficulty in using the dd model is that it still requires a high ca abundance in the high - velocity layers ( @xmath160 km  s@xmath2 ; table [ tab : abun ] ) despite the absence of a very strong si absorption at similar velocities .",
    "one problem with the csm interaction scenario is that it requires the accumulation of a relatively large mass .",
    "the estimated mass in the high - velocity shell is @xmath142 . in order to accumulate this mass ,",
    "a mass loss rate @xmath161 is required for a wind velocity of 10 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this mass loss rate is higher than that constrained from x - ray , optical and radio observations ( e.g. , cumming et al .",
    "1996 ; mattila et al . 2005 ; immler et al . 2006 ; hughes et al . 2007 ; panagia et al .",
    "a combination of these two scenarios ( i.e. , dd model and csm interaction ) may relax these requirements ( gerardy et al . 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , hvfs may reflect the pre - sn abundances of the progenitor wd . in the single - degenerate scenario ,",
    "the wd accretes matter from a companion star ( see nomoto et al .",
    "1994 for a review ) . at an accrretion rate",
    "suitable for stable h shell burning ( nomoto 1982 ) , he shell flashes are rather weak ( taam 1980 ; fujimoto & sugimoto 1982 ) , and their products can accrete onto the wd .",
    "the products of he shell flashes could be ca - rich depending on conditions such as the pressure at the burning shell ( hashimoto , hanawa & sugimoto 1983 ) .",
    "after many cycles of he flashes , when the mass of the wd reaches the chandrasekhar mass , the outermost layers of the wd should consist not only of c and o but also of heavier elements .",
    "if such matter resides in the outermost layers after the explosion , it could cause hvfs . to investigate this scenario further , the growth of the wd should be studied in detail .",
    "if and hvfs are caused by the explosion itself or by csm interaction , they should correlate ( see fig .",
    "12 in tanaka et al .",
    "in fact , this seems to be the case for sne 2002bo , 2002dj , 2001el , and 2003cg , but the correlation is not clear for sne 2002er and 2003du ( figs . [",
    "fig : si ] and [ fig : ca ] ) .",
    "this may be useful to discriminate the origin of the hvfs .",
    "the relation between lc width and luminosity in sne ia indicates that the properties of sne ia are determined by a single dominant parameter .",
    "however , dispersion is present in the relation , and it may due to uncertainties in distance and reddening or to intrinsic properties of sne ia ( mazzali & podsiadlowski 2006 ) . understanding the origins of the dispersion is important for a more precise cosmological use of sne ia .",
    "the earliest spectra of sne ia are clearly not determined by a single parameter , e.g. , sne with a similar maximum luminosity have different line velocities .",
    "therefore , the variation in the early phase spectra could , to some extent , reveal an intrinsic dispersion in the width - luminosity relation .",
    "since the variation of properties is larger in hvg than in lvg sne ( b05 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2007 ) , the hvg group at least could be related to the dispersion in the width - luminosity relation .    a first parameter to look at in this context is the kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "hvg sne may have higher kinetic energy than lvg by at most @xmath162% (  [ sec : hvglvg ] ) .",
    "since the light curve width ( @xmath163 ) scales roughly as @xmath164 ( arnett 1982 ) , where @xmath165 is the kinetic energy of the ejecta , the lc width of hvg sne may become narrower than that of lvg sne .",
    "this effect should not be significant given the dependence of @xmath163 .",
    "however , an earlier lc rise , accompanied by a brighter luminosity at maximum even when the ejecta contain the same amount of @xmath4ni , is a change orthogonal to the observed width - luminsity relation .",
    "thus , differences in @xmath165 could cause an intrinsic dispersion in the width - luminosity relation .",
    "the @xmath4ni  distribution could also affect the lc rise time .",
    "if hvg sne have an extended @xmath4ni  distribution as suggested in ",
    "[ sec : hvglvg ] , their lc may peak earlier than in the case where @xmath4ni  is confined in the innermost layers because the diffusion time is shorter for the outer @xmath4ni",
    ". an early lc rise would make the peak luminosity brighter even for the same @xmath4ni  mass .",
    "consequently , sne with similar @xmath132 may have different peak luminosities in certain conditions of mixing ( e.g. , mazzali & podsiadlowski 2006 , woosley et al .",
    "the outermost ejecta of type ia sne are studied by modeling very early spectra . of the 6 sne we studied ,",
    "2 ( sne 2002bo and 2002dj ) are classified as hvg , being characterized by a high photospheric velocity and a low photospheric temperature .",
    "all three lvg sne ( sne 2001el , 2003cg and 2003du ) have uniform properties and are characterized by a low photospheric velocity and a high photospheric temperature .",
    "the properties of sn 2002er , which is classified as hvg , are close to those of lvg , suggesting that there is continuity between the groups .",
    "this is consistent with suggestions by branch et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 )    hvg sne have a @xmath06355 line with a pronounced emission peak and a broad blue absorption , suggesting that si is present at @xmath86 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the abundance distribution in hvg sne is similar to that of a delayed detonation model , i.e. , the burning front reaches the outermost layers . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath06355 emission profile of lvg sne tends to be suppressed , possibly because of the presence of @xmath06578 .",
    "this suggests that the burning front in lvg sne is weaker than in hvg sne .",
    "however , the mass fraction of carbon at the photosphere of lvg sne is only @xmath66(c ) @xmath166 , and the estimated c mass is less than @xmath142 , which is less than predicted by w7 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the difference in the photospheric velocity explains the different appearance of hvg and lvg sne at pre - maximum phases through the temperature difference . at the highest velocities ( @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 ) , however , the variety of the and features is not explained by this scenario .",
    "this may require additional factors such as asphericity or diversity in the element abundance of the progenitor wd .",
    "both stable fe and @xmath4ni  are detected at the photosphere ( @xmath167 km  s@xmath2 ) in all 6 sne , suggesting that fe - group elements are always present in the outer layers .",
    "the differece in their abundances may be an important reason for the diversity among sn ia spectra .",
    "on the other hand , the difference in kinetic energy between hvg and lvg sne is too small to be the origin of the spectral diversity .",
    "the diversity of sne ia seen in early phase spectra could cause the intrinsic dispersion in the lc width - luminosity relation , through the difference in kinetic energy and the amount of iron - group elements in the outer layers .",
