    "recent findings on the acceleration of the universe are based on the brightness of type ia supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the diversity of the brightness has not been fully understood yet , which may be related to their binary evolution paths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order to elucidate the physics of type ia supernovae ,",
    "every evolutionary path to type ia supernovae should be examined , even though its production rate is very rare . in these paths ,",
    "the response of white dwarfs ( wds ) to hydrogen / helium matter accretion is a key process and , especially , the efficiency of mass accumulation is crucial .",
    "recent binary evolution scenarios of type ia supernovae include a wd accreting matter lost by a companion @xcite , although the merger model of double degenerates has not been fully rejected yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these scenarios ,",
    "the wd grows in mass and explodes as a type ia supernova when it reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "when the accretion rate of hydrogen is much smaller than @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , hydrogen shell flash triggers a nova outburst .",
    "almost all of the accreted matter is blown off or even the wd is eroded by convective dredge - up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the accretion rate is as large as @xmath9 yr@xmath8 or more , the shell flash is relatively weak or hydrogen burning is stable so that most part of the accreted matter is processed to helium and then accumulates on the wd .",
    "another possible way to type ia supernovae is an helium accretor ; the wd accretes helium from companion helium star and grows in mass to the chandrasekhar mass limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a case , a helium shell flash occurs to develop a nova outburst when the mass accretion rate is smaller than a critical value , which varies from @xmath10 to 1 @xmath11  yr@xmath8 , depending on the wd mass .",
    "if the helium shell flashes occur , the wind mass loss carries away a part of the envelope matter , which reduces the growth rate of the wd .",
    "@xcite have calculated binary evolution that contains a helium accreting wd . in their calculation , the effect of wind mass loss is partly taken into account based on an empirical formula of wolf - rayet star mass loss , whereas @xcite have used the mass accumulation efficiency of helium accretion calculated by @xcite for a 1.3 @xmath5 wd . in this way , the mass accumulation efficiency is a crucial factor for evolution of the binary .",
    "@xcite have calculated evolution of wd binaries in a phase of thermal timescale mass - transfer . the crucial factor of the binary evolutions is the reaction of wds against high mass transfer rate , that is , the mass accretion efficiency for hydrogen / helium shell flashes . @xcite addressed the mass accumulation efficiency of helium novae is one of the three fundamental factors that should be clarified in order to advance the evolutionary scenarios to the next step .",
    "the mass accumulation efficiency for helium shell flashes has been calculated but only for a @xmath12 wd @xcite .",
    "from the observational point of view , such a helium shell flash should be observed as a helium nova outburst .",
    "recently , in late 2000 , v445 puppis was discovered at its outburst stage .",
    "@xcite suggested , from its infra - red spectrum features , that v445 pup is the first identified helium nova .",
    "@xcite calculated light curves of helium novae for various wd masses to fit them with the observational data .",
    "they concluded that the light curve can be well fitted by a helium nova on a wd having its mass more massive than @xmath13 .",
    "this massive wd indicates that the wd is now growing in mass even for such a violent helium shell flash .",
    "@xcite suggested that v445 pup is a progenitor of type ia supernova .",
    "therefore , we are forced to realize the importance of mass loss / mass accumulation during helium shell flashes on the wd .",
    "@xcite calculated the evolution of helium shell flashes on an @xmath14 wd . @xcite",
    "have recalculated the helium shell flashes with opal opacity and obtained the mass accumulation efficiency , i.e. , the ratio of the envelope mass accumulated after one cycle of helium shell flash to the ignition mass .",
    "these two works are done only for a @xmath14 wd and no results have been presented for other wd masses . if the accumulation efficiency is very small for less massive wds , the evolution scenarios should be drastically changed . in this letter , therefore , we have calculated mass accumulation efficiency of helium shell flashes for various wd masses .",
    "the decay phase of helium nova outbursts is followed based on an optically thick wind theory @xcite .",
    "the structure of the wd envelope is calculated by solving the equations of motion , continuity , energy transport , and energy conservation .",
    "the details of computation have been already presented in @xcite for helium shell flashes on a @xmath15 wd .    here",
    ", we examine other various wd masses , i.e. , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the radius of the wds are assumed as given in table 1 because of the following reasons : in time - dependent calculation @xcite , the radius of the nuclear burning shell moves back and forth during one cycle of a helium shell flash . in the @xmath14 wd case",
    ", we assumed the radius as a time - averaged mean value of the radius ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for wd masses other than @xmath17 , however , no time - dependent calculation of helium shell flashes is presented .",
    "therefore , we estimate the radius from an geometrical mean of the two radii , i.e. , the naked c+o core radii of two steadily - accreting wd with the mass accretion rate of @xmath18 and @xmath19  yr@xmath8(private communication with h. saio 2003 ) .    after the onset of a shell flash , helium is processed to carbon and oxygen .",
    "helium burning produces nuclear energy , a large part of which is consumed for the envelope matter to be push upward against the gravity .",
    "the nuclear energy release is almost comparable to the gravitational potential , and a large part of the envelope is processed in very early stage of explosion , i.e. , before the expansion of the envelope .",
    "the processed matter is then mixed into the whole envelope by convection .",
    "therefore , we assume the composition of the envelope to be uniform with the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as listed in table 1 . here",
    ", we assume @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 includes @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the solar abundance ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath27 for the @xmath14 wd is taken from @xcite .",
    "changing the ratio of carbon to oxygen with the total mass ratio constant ( @xmath28const . )",
    "hardly changes the result .",
    "opal opacity is used .",
    "figure 1 shows the photospheric temperature @xmath29 , the photospheric wind velocity @xmath30 , the photospheric radius @xmath31 , the wind mass loss rate @xmath32 ( _ dotted _ ) , and the total mass decreasing rate of the envelope @xmath33 , ( _ solid _ ) , here the mass decreasing rate owing to nuclear burning is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the nuclear luminosity .",
    "the solution of @xmath15 is already presented in @xcite . at the maximum expansion of the envelope after the onset of a shell flash",
    ", the star reaches somewhere on the curve , depending on the envelope mass at ignition , and moves leftward in time .",
    "the wind mass loss stops at the point marked by the small open circles .",
    "after that , the star continues to move leftward owing to nuclear burning .",
    "helium nuclear burning stops at the end of each curve . in the case of @xmath36",
    "wd , we have obtained only a very short sequence , because of a numerical difficulty ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "no winds occur in the @xmath37 wd .",
    "figure 2 shows the mass accumulation efficiency @xmath38 defined by the ratio of the processed matter remaining after one cycle of helium shell flash to the ignition mass .",
    "the amount of matter processed or lost by the wind are calculated from the wind mass loss rate and nuclear burning rate in figure 1 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . here",
    ", we use the relation between the ignition mass and the helium accretion rate ( private communication with h. saio 2004 ) obtained based on a steady state in which non - homologous term of gravitational energy generation is neglected @xcite . for the case of @xmath37 ,",
    "no wind occurs and all of the envelope matter is processed to accumulate on the wd , if the binary separation is large enough for the expanded envelope to reside in the roche lobe . in low accretion rates ( @xmath39yr@xmath40 )",
    "a helium detonation may cause a supernova explosion .",
    "the value of @xmath38 in figure 2 is approximated by the following algebraic form .",
    "@xmath41    for 1.35 @xmath5 wd ,    @xmath42    for 1.3 @xmath5 wd ,    @xmath43    for 1.2 @xmath5 wd .",
    "this equation is well fitted also to 1.1 @xmath5 wd .",
    "@xmath44    for 1.0 @xmath5 wd ,    @xmath45    for 0.9 @xmath5 wd ,    @xmath46    for 0.8 @xmath5 wd .",
    "when the wd mass is increased , winds begin to blow at @xmath47 .",
    "the winds become stronger as the wd mass is further increased .",
    "the accumulation efficiency @xmath38 then decreases because of much stronger wind mass loss .",
    "the 1.1 and @xmath48 wds take the smallest values of @xmath38 for all accretion rates . for more massive wds , @xmath38 increases with the wd mass because the nuclear burning rates are much higher than the wind mass loss rates owing to the strong gravity . as a result ,",
    "most of the envelope mass accumulates on these more massive wds .",
    "the accumulation efficiency has different values if we assume a different chemical composition or a wd radius .",
    "as the @xmath21 content becomes larger , the mass accumulation ratio increases because the wind becomes weak but the nuclear burning rate increases . for example , if we increase @xmath21 from 0.5 to 0.6 in the @xmath14 case , @xmath38 increases by 0.08 , and from 0.3 to 0.4 in the @xmath49 wd , @xmath38 increases by @xmath50 .",
    "if we assume a smaller wd radius , the wind becomes stronger , and we get a smaller accumulation efficiency @xmath38 . for example , if we take the chandrasekhar radius for the @xmath48 wd as the smallest limit , @xmath38 decreases by @xmath51 at @xmath52  yr@xmath53 and by 0.12 at @xmath52  yr@xmath54 .    for the @xmath55 wd",
    ", no wind occurs .",
    "all the accreted mass is processed to carbon and oxygen and accumulated on the wd .",
    "we have not presented solutions of the @xmath55 wd in figure 1 , because the wd radius changes largely depending on the mass accretion rate between @xmath52  yr@xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , a density inversion layer appears around @xmath58 , which causes a numerical difficulty of the computation .",
    "we have assumed no dredge - up of wd material into the envelope . if wd material under the accreted helium layer is mixed into the envelope , the helium content @xmath20 is reduced , which increases the mass decreasing rate owing to nuclear burning becomes larger , because @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "the wind mass loss becomes weak due to the decrease in opacity , i.e. , @xmath32 becomes smaller .",
    "therefore , mixing of wd matter has effects to increase the mass accumulation efficiency , because @xmath60 .    for example , in the case of @xmath61",
    ", if the same amount of wd mass is mixed to the envelope mass , i.e. , @xmath20 is @xmath62 at ignition .",
    "it reduced much more in the course of rising phase , because a time dependent calculation ( kato , saio and hachisu 1989 ) shows that @xmath20 decreases from 0.98 to 0.5 in the rising phase .",
    "as the gravitational potential is comparable to nuclear energy generation as shown in table 1 , a large part of helium is consumed to lift the whole envelope up against the gravity at the beginning phase of outburst .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is reduced to @xmath63 or less .",
    "the change of @xmath20 causes the change in nuclear burning rate and the opacity . as a results ,",
    "the wind mass loss does not occur for the envelope less than @xmath64 , which correspond to the mass accretion rate @xmath65yr@xmath66 i.e. , @xmath67 is almost 100 percent at @xmath68 .",
    "even the wind occurs , the mass loss rate is as low as 1/10 of nuclear burning rate and almost all of the envelope mass will accumulate on the wd .",
    "it is not known whether wd material is dredged up or not , or how much amount is dredged up . in the case of hydrogen shell flashes , enrichment of wd material is observed in ejecta of classical novae , which is an evidence of dredged - up of wd material .",
    "however , no heavy element enrichment is observed in recurrent nova ejecta .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the dredge up mechanisms do not effectively work if the recurrence period is short ( or the mass accretion rate is high ) .    in the case of he",
    "novae , only one object , v445 pup , is observed so far .",
    "there are many bright c lines in outburst phase , but we do nt know this carbon is originated from wd material or processed helium .",
    "the wd mass is estimated to be @xmath69 , and the recurrence period to be several tens of years ( kato and hachisu 2003 ) .",
    "such a very massive wd itself may suggest that the wd is now growing , but not that dredge up mechanisms are working .",
    "@xcite have criticized hachisu et al.s ( 1996 ) model in which accreting wds grow in mass and reach the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the main point of their criticism is that @xcite have neglected the interaction between the donor and the extended envelope during helium shell flashes .",
    "@xcite speculated that most of the envelope mass is lost from the binary by the effect of the companion and , as a result , the wd can not grow from @xmath70 to the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "if so , the type ia scenario proposed by @xcite is seriously damaged .",
    "however , as already discussed in @xcite , the viscous heating by the companion motion in the envelope is not effective when the wind blows .",
    "it is because the wind velocity is much faster than the companion motion and the wind quickly escapes from the binary system with almost no interaction between them . for wds more massive than @xmath36 ,",
    "the wind is fast enough and therefore we can neglect effects of interaction between the wind and the companion s orbital motion . once the optically thick wind blows and its velocity is faster than the orbital motion , we are able to estimate the accumulation efficiency only from the wind solutions .",
    "@xcite adopted los alamos opacity that shows much smaller values ( about one - third ) than those of opal opacity around the temperature of @xmath71 .",
    "the envelope solutions for los alamos opacity are largely different from for opal opacity when the photospheric temperature is lower than this value ( i.e. , @xmath72 ( k)@xmath73 . when opal opacity is adopted , we obtain a more massive envelope mass and a higher temperature at the hydrogen burning region for the same photospheric radius . as a result",
    ", we have a higher nuclear burning rate for a higher temperature",
    ". a larger part of the envelope mass is quickly processed into @xmath21 and accumulates on the wd .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a higher mass accumulation efficiency is resulted even when the strong wind blows .      the mass accumulation efficiency of helium shell flashes , @xmath38 , is a crucial factor for binary evolutions of type ia supernovae . for wds more massive than @xmath74 , helium shell flashes trigger an optically thick wind mass loss",
    "we have calculated @xmath38 for @xmath75 wds ; more than 50% ( @xmath76 ) is accumulated on the wd after one cycle of helium shell flash for @xmath52  yr@xmath77 on the wd masses of @xmath75 . for wds less massive than @xmath37 ,",
    "no wind mass loss occurs and all the accreted matter remains on the wd if we can neglect the effect of the roche lobe overflow .",
