    "brans - dicke theory@xcite remained amongst the most talked about relativistic theory of gravity after general relativity .",
    "soon after the theory was brought into being , a conformal transformation was suggested by dicke@xcite which can recast the theory in a different frame , called einstein frame where the field equations look more tractable .",
    "the original theory , given in a frame , popularly dubbed as the jordan frame , is a manifestly non - minimally coupled theory where a long range scalar field @xmath0 has an interference term with the curvature @xmath1 .",
    "the term looks like @xmath2 in the action",
    ". a suitable conformal transformation of the form @xmath3 breaks this non - minimal coupling so that the scalar field contributes only through the kinetic term in the action .",
    "the matter part also now depends on the scalar field as the stress energy tensor goes through a corresponding transformation@xcite .",
    "this dependence does not formally affect the calculations unless one goes on to solve the geodesic equation .",
    "this conformally transformed frame is called the einstein frame . brans - dicke ( bd )",
    "theory indicates that the newtonian constant @xmath4 effectively is a function of the scalar field @xmath0 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant and can be taken to be the present value of @xmath4 in a cosmological context . in the so called einstein frame",
    ", @xmath4 regains its status of being a universal constant but the price one has to pay is that the rest mass of the test particle becomes a function of the scalar field @xmath0 and hence one has to forgo the principle of equivalence . for a compact review of this and some related issues",
    ", we refer to the work of morganstern@xcite . + the intriguing question that is still alive is whether this two descriptions are equivalent or not .",
    "cho@xcite argued that the jordan frame is not really the physical description of gravity and the same conclusion holds for kaluza - klein theory .",
    "faraoni and gunzig@xcite arrived at the result that , within the realm of classical framework , einstein frame is more trustworthy than the jordan frame .",
    "their work was based upon considerations of gravitational waves .",
    "chiba and yamaguchi discussed the frame dependence of various cosmological parameters@xcite . in a more recent work , faraoni and nadeau@xcite , however , show that the with some proper interpretation , the two versions are actually equivalent at the classical level .",
    "salgado@xcite also showed that the apparent mismatch of the cauchy problem in the two versions can actually be resolved . + it is quite expected that the two versions do not give the same physics as they are based upon different physical principles , the principle of equivalence holds in one and does not in the other .",
    "notwithstanding the question of which version is better , practising relativists prefer to work in the jordan frame so as to be in the comfort zone of the principle of equivalence . for a computational advantage",
    ", one might opt for the einstein frame but while discussing the physical aspects , the metric is transformed back to the jordan frame via the inverse transformation provided there is no singularity in the solution of the scalar field .",
    "+ now the bigger question arises regarding the equivalence of the physics obtained in one frame and that in the same frame when the solutions are actually transformed back from the other .",
    "the question might appear superfluous , but deserves attention in view of the high degree of nonlinearity in einstein systems . in the present work",
    ", we deal with the question whether these two frames are equivalent even when they are looked at in the same jordan frame at the quantum level . in the two frames they would look different ,",
    "but if we transform the solutions in the einstein frame back to the jordan frame by effecting the inverse transformation at the level of the solution , would they look the same ?",
    "we find an answer in the negative !",
    "we quantize a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model with a perfect fluid in brans - dicke theory in both the versions and pretend that these two are different models altogether .",
    "then we transform the solution for the wave - packet in the einstein frame to the jordan frame via the inverse conformal transformation and check if these two results match .",
    "it is quite clearly observed that the results are different .",
    "it would have been nice to work only with a bd field , i.e. , without a fluid content , but the evolution of the fluid provides a meaningful choice of a properly oriented time parameter , so the evolution of the system obtained is indeed physically relevant .",
    "+ recently there has been a similar result , given by artymowski , ma and zhang@xcite , in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "it is shown that the quantized version of a spatially flat frw model in bd theory either in vacuum or in the case of an additional scalar field indeed shows different behaviour in the two frames in the formalism of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "+ in the following section we present the quantum bd model in the jordan frame and in section 3 the same in einstein frame . in the last section",
    "we discuss the conclusions drawn from the present work .",
    "the relevant action for brans - dicke theory with a perfect fluid can be written as @xmath7 + \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g } ~p~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath0 is the bd scalar field which is non - minimally coupled to gravity and @xmath8 is the dimensionless bd parameter . here",
    "units are so chosen that @xmath9 .",
    "the last term in the equation ( 1 ) represents the perfect fluid contribution to the action where @xmath10 is the pressure and is related to the energy density by the equation of state @xmath11 where @xmath12 . this restriction on @xmath13 stems from the consideration that sound waves can not propagate faster than light .",
    "we shall work in a spatially flat spacetime given by the metric @xmath14 where n(t ) is called the lapse function , and @xmath15 is the flat 3-space metric . in schutz",
    "s formalism @xcite , the fluid four velocity can be expressed in terms of some thermodynamic potentials . using the normalization of the velocity vector @xmath16",
    "one can write the pressure @xmath10 in any spacetime without rotation as @xmath17 and the fluid part of the action takes the form ( in a comoving system where @xmath18 ) @xmath19 \\ , .\\ ] ] as none of the quantities mentioned depende on space coordinates , the spatial part of the volume integral @xmath20 yields a constant @xmath21 which is taken to be unity .",
    "this does not infringe upon the generality as the constant will not contribute to the subsequaent variation . here",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are thermodynamic potentials which determine the velocity vector in schutz formalism . they all satisfy their own evolution equations . an overhead dot represents a differentiation with respect to the coordinate time @xmath26 .",
    "the detailed method can be found in the work of lapchinskii and rubakov@xcite .",
    "the method has been subsequently used with a high degree of usefulness by many , such as alvarenga _ et al_@xcite , vakili@xcite , majumder and banerjee@xcite , pal and banerjee@xcite . particularly , for a scalar field",
    ", the method had been utilized by vakili@xcite , majumder@xcite and almeida _",
    ". a very similar approach of expressing the fluid lagrangian in terms thermodynamic variables has been utilized very recently by b@xmath27hmer , tamanini and wright@xcite and koivisto , saridakis and tamanini@xcite .",

    "one should emphasize that this comparison is made after the einstein frame solution is transformed back to the jordan frame via the inverse transformation , @xmath115 .",
    "the solutions are intricate , so it is perhaps better to look at some physical aspects of the solutions .",
    "the norm of the wave packets are found in the two versions .",
    "they are given by equations ( 23 ) and ( 34 ) for the one that calculated in the jordan frame directly and the one that calculated in the jordan frame from the solutions transformed back from the einstein frame respectively .",
    "the norms are depicted in figures ( [ modpsi ] ) and ( [ modpsi2 ] ) respectively for two epochs of time .",
    "it is once again quite evident from the figures that the corresponding norms are qualitatively different , peaked at different locations .",
    "thus it is conclusively established that the two frames are physically different at least at the quantum level .",
    "it is true that this work shows this in one example .",
    "but one counter example is good enough to show the non - equivalence of the two frames .",
    "the particular values of @xmath13 and @xmath8 chosen are indeed for the sake of analytical calculations , but the values are quite legitimate , @xmath69 represents a pressureless dust , and @xmath66 is neither pathological nor trivial .",
    "in fact , as evident from the action functional ( 27 ) , @xmath116 is the trivial case as it indicates a zero kinetic energy for the bd field and values of @xmath8 less than that would indicate a pathology of a negative kinetic energy .    we have solved the wheeler dewitt equation for another case as well ,",
    "namely @xmath117 indicating an effective cosmological constant with another legitimate value of @xmath118 but the comparison of the two frames were not possible for the difficulty in the integration .",
    "however , if we compare the solution of the wheeler - dewitt equations , namely the solution given in equation ( 18 ) with that in ( 29 ) , it is rather apparent that they would not match after effecting the inverse transformation in the latter .",
    "this indeed lends a support towards the claim of the present work regarding the nonequivalence of the two frames .    in agreement with the recent result in loop quantum cosmology@xcite",
    ", the present work , in a different philosophy of quantization , explicitly shows that jordan frame and einstein frames are physically different .",
    "our result is also consistent with the finding of faraoni and nadeau@xcite that the two frames are not equivalent at the quantum level .",
    "certainly there is ample scope of improvement on the present work .",
    "an important issue is that there is nothing to check that the hamiltonian written in the two frames correspond to each other so far as the operator ordering is concerned .",
    "the only thing that could be taken care of in terms of correspondence is the fact that in both cases the functions of the coordinates come first followed by the momenta .",
    "we also took care to fix the boundary conditions in some way .",
    "but question remains if that is enough .",
    "+    but the question of this equivalence is important , and until this is settled , this kind of indications have to be relied upon in the absence of better results . + *",
