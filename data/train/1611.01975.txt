    "in real world , quantum systems are open systems interacting with their environments .",
    "dynamics of an open system can be described by either markovian or non - markovian approach .",
    "markovian dynamics is based on the assumptions that the coupling between the system under study and its environment is weak and that the initial system - environment ( s - e ) state is factorized neglecting all memory effects .",
    "violation of any one of these conditions may lead to non - markovian dynamics which guarantees the existence of memory effects in time evolution of an open system @xcite . + as mentioned in the above , initial correlation between a system and its environment is one of the important factors to determine the markovianity or non - markovianity of the dynamics .",
    "thus it plays a very important role in time evolution of an open system .",
    "if there is not any initial correlation , the dynamics of an open system is described by a completely positive map @xcite . in recent years , many attempts have been made to study open quantum systems with initial s - e correlations . in the presence of initial correlation",
    ", it is shown that dynamics of an open quantum system may not be completely positive @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been indicated that entangled initial states can lead to non - completely positive maps @xcite . in the case that quantum discord of initial states vanishes",
    ", the dynamics is described by a completely positive map @xcite .",
    "shabani and lidar showed that the above - mentioned condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for complete positivity of the corresponding map@xcite . recently",
    ", some examples were provided to show that the relation between complete positivity and quantum discord is not generalized to all cases @xcite .",
    "+ the initial s - e correlations may lead to increase the trace distance over its initial value @xcite .",
    "according to the definition of the trace distance between two arbitrary states @xcite , it can be regarded as a measure for the degree of distinguishability of the two states .",
    "if the value of the trace distance during a system evolution is not constant , one can conclude that there is a flow of information between the system and its environment @xcite .",
    "a tight upper bound for its increasing has been derived which can be considered as a witness for initial s - e correlations @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , a lot of effort has been put in to investigate the influence of initial s - e and environemtal correlations on an open system dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , a clear general relation has not yet been found between them , and the following questions need to be answered : how do initial environmental correlations affect the dynamics of an open system ?",
    "how can we obtain information about initial states of an environment ?",
    "+ in this paper , we study the role of initial correlations among environments on the dynamics of an open system . for this purpose , we consider a tripartite system . in a tripartite system one",
    "can face to three scenarios : a system and two environments ; two systems and one environment ; and one system , one environment and one ancilla . here",
    ", we find an upper bound for the time evolution of the trace distance in the first scenario .",
    "when the trace distance grows above its initial value , the upper bound can be regarded as a witness for initial environmental correlations .",
    "also , we regard some examples to illustrate the tightness of the upper bound . it should be noted that realizing initial environmental correlations may help us to characterize the environment and control its effects . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the above - mentioned questions in detail with the help of the three - qubit heisenberg xx spin chain and an experimental example .",
    "we will see that the initial correlations alter the information flow .",
    "accordingly , initial correlations can be witnessed from the dynamical features of the open system .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii a review of the concept of the trace distance is provided and its important role in determining the direction of information flow and also the amount of total correlations is explained .",
    "upper bound for the growth of the distinguishability is derived in sec .",
    "iii . in order to witness initial correlations , backflow of information",
    "is investigated for three - qubit heisenberg xx spin chain and an experimental example in sec .",
    "the paper concludes in sec",
    "the trace distance of two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2 where the trace norm of an operator a is introduced by@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it represents a metric on space of physical states , because @xmath4 $ ] , ( @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 , and @xmath7 if and only if @xmath0 and @xmath1 have orthogonal supports ) and it satisfies the triangular inequality , @xmath8 .",
    "+ the other properties of the trace distance are its subadditivity with respect to the tensor product @xmath9 and its contractivity under all trace - preserving positive maps , i.e. @xmath10 , where the equality holds if @xmath11 is a unitary transformation .",
    "it is well known that the trace distance can be interpreted as a measure for the distinguishability of the states , therefore a trace - preserving positive map can never increase the distinguishability of any two quantum states @xcite .",
    "+ the variation of distinguishability of two states can be considered as a witness for the flow of information in an open quantum system .",
    "let s be an open quantum system interacting to an environment e. if @xmath12 are two different initial states of s , their time evolutions obey @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the corresponding quantum dynamical map .",
    "the time variation of the trace distance is interpreted as _ information flow _ , and is shown by @xmath15 positive values of @xmath16 in some time intervals correspond to information backflow from the environment to the system and the negative values indicate the information flow from the system to the environment .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 can be regarded as a quantifier for the information exchange between an open system and its environment @xcite . in eq.(4 ) , @xmath18 can be interpreted as the information inside the system at time @xmath19 , therefore @xmath20 shows the difference between the information inside the system at @xmath21 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "when both @xmath20 and @xmath16 are positive , one can obtain more information than that of the initial state of the system .",
    "+ for any state @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath23 describes how well @xmath22 can be distinguished from the fully uncorrelated product state @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 can be interpreted as a measure for the total amount of correlations in the state @xmath22 .",
    "+ suppose an open system @xmath25 coupled to its environment @xmath26 , with initial states @xmath27 . using the subadditivity and the triangular inequality of the trace distance ,",
    "one can obtain the following inequality @xcite @xmath28 the above inequality shows an upper bound of information backflow from the environment to the system .",
    "the upper bound implies that the probable increase of the distinguishability over the initial value is due to the initial correlations in the total initial states @xmath29 or different initial states of the environment @xmath26 . + in the next section with using the properties of the trace distance , we obtain the upper bound of the backflow of information in tripartite systems .",
    "assume a tripartite quantum system consisting three subsystems @xmath30 and c which can be coupled to each other .",
    "they form an isolated system described by the initial state @xmath31 .",
    "the state of the total system at time @xmath19 can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the unitary time evolution operator of the composite system with total hamiltonian @xmath34 . in a tripartite system one can face to three scenarios : a system and two environments ; two systems and one environment ; and one system , one environment and one ancilla .",
    "the first and the second scenarios are shown in fig",
    ", we investigate the first scenario .",
    "+ regarding the subsystem a as an open system s and the subsystems b and c as its environments .",
    "indeed the environment e includes two subsystems b and c [ see fig .",
    "suppose two initial states @xmath35 for total system , with corresponding reduced open system states @xmath36 and environment states @xmath37 . according to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the dynamics of the trace distance for the open system a can be written as @xmath38 as stated in the introduction , our main aim is to find a witness for the initial environmental correlations , therefore , we consider the second term in the right - hand side of the above equation . applying the subadditivity of the trace distance and the triangular inequality ( twice ) for @xmath39 , one can obtain @xmath40 substituting the above equation into eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we find @xmath41 where the above inequality generalizes the result of eq .",
    "this inequality shows that in the most general case an increase of the distinguishability above its initial value implies that there must be initial s - e correlations or initial correlations between environments or environments have different initial states .",
    "for the special case that there are no initial s - e correlations , the first summation in eq.(8 ) vanishes and we have @xmath42 let us consider a further important special case , which discloses most clearly the role of initial environmental correlations , and is obtained if we assume @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and also @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the inequality in eq.(9 ) is simplified to @xmath46 where the quantity on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) can be larger than zero because of the presence of initial environmental correlations in @xmath47 .",
    "this inequality shows that any increase of the trace distance over its initial value is a _",
    "witness _ for the presence of initial environmental correlations . when the inequality in eq.(10 ) becomes an equality at a certain time @xmath19",
    ", we can detect the initial environmental correlations .    here , we discuss some examples to illustrate the inequality in eq.(10 )",
    "suppose four qubits such that the first and second qubit are regarded as an open system s ( control qubits ) , and the third and fourth qubit are regarded as an environment ( target qubits ) , where the first ( second ) qubit interacts locally with the third ( fourth ) qubit , respectively .",
    "we first apply a controlled - not gate and then a swap operation on the two qubits .",
    "thus , the interaction is given by unitary operator @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we consider two total initial states as @xmath51 in which @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the state @xmath58 is a pure entangled state and @xmath59 is the product of marginal states of @xmath58 . for these total states ,",
    "the system states are the same .    under the action of the unitary operator @xmath60 the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) is found to be @xmath61 which shows that the trace distance of the open system states increases over its initial value .",
    "this means that the initial state of @xmath58 must be correlated .",
    "we also have @xmath62 which shows that the upper bound of the inequality in eq.(10 ) is reached .",
    "thus , the initial information in the environment state is transferred completely to the open system by applying the the unitary operator @xmath60 .",
    "now , we study a situation in which the initial environmental state has only classical correlations .",
    "assume two total initial states as @xmath63 where @xmath58 is a purely classical state and @xmath64 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath65 and the trace distance between initial environmental states is found to be @xmath66 .",
    "we , then , see that the equality sign in eq.(10 ) holds ; the tightness of the bound is illustrated again .",
    "also , this means that the trace distance can increase even when the initial states of the environment are mixed states .    in order to construct initial conditions for eq.(10 ) , we need a second reference state @xmath67 whose evolution is compared with that of the state @xmath68 . therefore , we regard three operators .",
    "the first one is the operator @xmath69 which removes the correlations between the open system and the environments , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "the second one is a local trace - preserving quantum operator generating a new state for the open system , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the third one is an operator which destroys the correlations among the environments as @xmath72 consequently , we have @xmath73 .",
    "+ in the next section , the trace distance dynamics will be illustrated by means of the heisenberg xx spin chain and an experimental example .",
    "we will see that the bound in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is not reached for these cases , but the growth of the distinguishability witnesses the correlations in the initial state of the environment .",
    "here , interactions between three qubits are investigated , which form a three - qubit heisenberg xx spin chain @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the chain subject to a uniform magnetic field is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the exchange interaction constant , @xmath76 is the pauli matrix corresponding to each @xmath77 @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the magnitude of a uniform magnetic field . introducing the spin raising and lowering operators of the @xmath80_th _ qubit @xmath81 , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath82 applying the periodic boundary conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 leads to the following eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath85 and @xmath86 in ( a ) and @xmath87 in ( b ) .",
    "similarly @xmath88 in ( c ) and @xmath89 in ( d ) .",
    "parameters : @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . ]",
    "if the normalized initial state is chosen as @xmath92 in which @xmath93 . + as a different case , one can assume that there are two excitations in the total system .",
    "thus , the initial state is defined as @xmath94 in which @xmath95 . +",
    "in order to show the influence of the initial correlations on the trace distance dynamics , we construct explicit initial states for the first and second scenario . in the first one , we regard the first qubit as an open system s and the other qubits as its environment e",
    "[ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , we consider the total initial states as @xmath96and @xmath97 where @xmath47 is a werner state , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .    for these states , we have @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath101 , and initial s - e correlations are zero . according to eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the upper bound of the increasing of the trace distance is restricted to the initial correlations between the environments in @xmath102 .    in order to calculate the trace distance dynamics of the open system",
    "a , we find the time evolution of these total states from eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 24 ) . then",
    ", with tracing over the environments ( b+c ) , the reduced open system dynamics can be obtained .",
    "the behavior of the trace distance of @xmath103 as a function of @xmath19 is plotted in fig .",
    "different initial states are considered with parameters @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . in figs.2(a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) the values of @xmath77 are assumed to be @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , respectively .    in fig.2(a ) , initial state of the environments in @xmath102 is defined by a bell state ( @xmath106 ) , a maximally entangled state . as can be seen ,",
    "the trace distance begins to increase after the initial time .",
    "this means that an amount of the initial environmental correlations flows to the reduced open system from the beginning of the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , it has a periodic behavior during the dynamics . in fig.2(b ) , the initial state of the environments in @xmath102 is not maximally entangled state and it is characterized by @xmath87 . from the figure one can see that the amount of information backflow is reduced by decreasing the initial environmental correlations although the dynamics behaviour is similar to fig .",
    "the value @xmath88 is used in fig.2(c ) , where the amount of quantum initial correlations decreases such that the amount of entanglement is zero but the amount of discord is not .",
    "we remark that the trace distance starts decreasing already at the initial time then it begins to grow at a later time .",
    "also , there exists a periodic behavior of its decreasing and increasing . in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the initial state of the environments in @xmath102 is given by @xmath89 .",
    "note that in this case the trace distance does not increase over its initial value .    in brief",
    ", fig.2 shows the effect of initial correlations among the environments on the trace distance dynamics of the open system .",
    "we conclude , for this example , that there is no initial s - e correlations , the amount of the information backflow from the environments to the open system is increased by increasing initial correlations among the environments and it can be led to increase distinguishability over its initial value . in situations investigated in fig.2 , the maximum amount of the trace distance as a function of time is not equal to the upper bound given by eq.(10 ) .",
    "this means that the information initially inaccessible to the open system has not been transferred completely to it during the dynamics .      as an experimental example",
    ", we consider two entangled photons whose polarization degrees of freedom locally interact with their frequency degrees of freedom .",

    "we have plotted @xmath18 in terms of @xmath130 for different values of the correlation coefficient in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the dynamics of the trace distance for @xmath141 , where the frequencies @xmath117 and @xmath118 are anticorrelated , has the maximum increasing and after a given time approaches to value of 0.5 .",
    "for @xmath142 the frequencies are not correlated and the trace distance is always zero .",
    "the trace distance decreases after an increasing then approaches to zero for other values of k. in fig .",
    "3(b ) , initial states of the open system are @xmath143 and @xmath144 and the initial environmental states are the same as fig .",
    "as can be seen , the trace distance raises above its initial value for @xmath141 and @xmath145 and it monotonically decreases for @xmath142 and @xmath146 .    finally , we conclude from fig.3 that the trace distance may increase over its initial value due to the initial environmental correlations and the best value of the correlation coefficient is @xmath141 for witnessing the initial correlations .",
    "dynamics of the trace distance with initial correlations has been studied in tripartite systems .",
    "we considered a scenario consisting of one system and two environments , and obtained the bound for the growth of distingushability in open systems .",
    "the bound can be used as a witness for initial correlations among environments .",
    "the obtained inequality is general and can be applied to any interaction among three systems .",
    "we demonstrated that initial correlations among environments can be witnessed by local measurements on the open quantum system without any knowledge of the structure of the environments or of the interaction between the open system and its environments .",
    "we illustrated that the bound is tight for initial classical and quantum environmental correlations .",
    "generally , since we do not have a lot of information about the initial states of the environments , those inequalities can be applied to obtain more information about the environments .",
    "those bounds have been confirmed by our findings in three - qubit heisenberg xx spin chain and an experimentally realizable example .",
    "we indicated that the distinguishability increases over its initial value due to initial correlations among the environments .",
