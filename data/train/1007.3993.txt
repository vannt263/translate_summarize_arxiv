    "circumstellar disks around young stars serve both as the sources of material for accreting young stars and as the sites of nascent planets orbiting such stars . numerous studies of such disks have exploited photometry and spectroscopy of dust emission , as manifest in the form of a thermal infrared excess above the stellar continuum , to ascertain fundamental properties such as disk dimensions , density structure , dust mass , and dust grain composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "observations that can establish the composition and evolution of the _ gaseous _ component within circumstellar disks around pre - ms and young ms stars , meanwhile , are essential if we are to understand the processes involved in jovian planet formation and the origins of comets and kuiper belt objects @xcite .",
    "for example , the near - ir lines of rovibrational h@xmath7 and co generally probe the terrestrial planet formation zones ( @xmath82 au ) of gas disks , interior to the regions where jovian planets are expected to form ( e.g. , @xcite ; however , see @xcite ) .",

    "the radial extent of the molecular disk is @xmath15 , or @xmath1370  au at the estimated 73  pc distance to v4046 sgr .",
    "the similar overall extent of the co emission in the n - s and e - w directions , coupled with the profound change in emission morphology with radial velocity , indicates that the disk is viewed at intermediate inclination ( compare with , e.g. , fig.3 in @xcite , which illustrates a keplerian molecular disk model viewed at an inclination of @xmath145@xmath4 ) . the channel map closest to the systemic lsr velocity ( @xmath20 km s@xmath14 ) indicates a disk position angle ( pa ) on the sky of @xmath175@xmath4 , measured east of north .",
    "this pa is similar to that inferred for the dust disk from the 230 ghz continuum emission detected and resolved by the sma ( see   [ continuum ] ) .",
    "we further refine these estimates for disk inclination , pa , and @xmath21 in   4.1 .",
    "the sma @xmath2co(21 ) and @xmath3co(21 ) emission line profiles , as obtained by spatially integrating the line intensity maps within a @xmath22 radius circular aperture , are highly symmetric ( figures  [ fig : smaspectra ] and  [ fig : smaspectra2 ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the asymmetric appearance of the co line profiles obtained with the iram 30-m telescope @xcite was a consequence of slight mispointing ( the 30-m data were obtained at very low source elevation , @xmath11520@xmath4 , due to the southerly decination of v4046 sgr ) combined with the spatial resolution of the source by the 30-m beam , as opposed to significant density or temperature inhomogeneities intrinsic to the molecular disk .      the continuum emission from the dust is partially resolved ( figure  [ fig : cont ] ) . using miriad",
    ", we fit an elliptical gaussian to the continuum visibilities to estimate the size and shape of the emission . the best fit yields major and minor axes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , with a position angle of @xmath25 east of north .",
    "this position angle is consistent with that inferred from the co maps (  4.1 ) .",
    "there is negligible contribution from the ( @xmath26 ) seeing at 1.3 mm to this gaussian fit . at a distance of @xmath173",
    "pc , the disk resolved by the continuum would have a characteristic radial extent of about 36  au ( corresponding to the fwhm of the surface brightness distribution ) . both the flux ( @xmath15  mjy ) and spatial extent of the disk at 1.3 mm are consistent with @xmath140  k blackbody dust grains located at a distance of @xmath140  au from the central binary ( @xcite80  au quoted in @xcite is actually a diameter .",
    "the semi - major axis is @xmath140  au . ] ) .",
    "to determine more precise values for the disk parameters , we employed standard modeling techniques previously used to interpret interferometric maps of molecular line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , we used the monte carlo radiative transfer code ratran @xcite to solve for the co level populations at each position within the disk and thereby to generate sky - projected emission - line images .",
    "these images were then passed to the miriad task _ uvmodel _ to sample the model images at the same spatial frequencies as our sma data .",
    "a minimum @xmath27 is obtained by directly comparing the model and observed visibilities @xcite .",
    "the model geometry is that of a keplerian disk in hydrostatic equilibrium with truncated power laws in density and temperature described ( respectively ) by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 refers to the number ( mid plane ) density of h@xmath7 and we assume co : h@xmath31",
    ".    there are ten parameters that describe this keplerian disk model ( see table 2 ) . in practice , however , our modeling can constrain only five of these : the central mass , the systemic velocity ( @xmath32 ) , and the co disk inclination ( @xmath33 ) , pa , and outer truncation radius ( @xmath34 ) . the modeling",
    "is relatively insensitive to the other parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and inner truncation radius @xmath39 ) because the @xmath2co(21 ) emission imaged by the sma is optically thick @xcite and originates from the cooler , outer regions of the disk ( the @xmath3co(21 ) emission - line data are too noisy to provide useful constraints on the disk density structure parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is degeneracy between central mass and disk inclination ; for the former , we initially adopted the total stellar mass of 1.8@xmath5 determined by @xcite , then varied this parameter so as to explore the potential range of @xmath33 in more detail (  4.2 ) .",
    "the values of parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( table 2 ) were fixed according to results obtained from models of the molecular disks orbiting other t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the remaining model parameters ( @xmath32 , p.a . ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 ) were then varied in turn so as to ascertain best - fit values .",
    "the resulting set of best - fit model parameters and their formal 1-@xmath18 uncertainties are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "these uncertainties do not account for systematic errors ( see below ) , as they were determined from the change in reduced @xmath27 as the model parameters were varied ; a representative contour plot of reduced @xmath27 ( illustrating its dependence on p.a . and @xmath33 ) is presented in figure  [ contourmaps ] .",
    "the best - fit keplerian disk model is presented in the form of synthetic velocity - resolved images in fig  [ fig : modelmaps ] and as a position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram alongside the observed p - v diagram in fig  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "the value of @xmath40 au obtained from the model fitting confirms our earlier `` eyeball '' estimate .",
    "the systemic velocity we find from fitting the sma data , @xmath41  km  s@xmath14 , is consistent with that determined from single - dish , mm - wave co spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "the inferred disk inclination of @xmath42@xmath4 is very similar to the value previously assumed in determining the masses of the components of the central binary system ( see below ) .",
    "the position angle obtained from the best - fit model ( @xmath43 ) is consistent with that derived from the elliptical gaussian fit to the continuum visibility ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the truncated power law model generated by these best - fit parameters reproduces well the overall emission morphlogies apparent in the velocity channel maps .",
    "there is some structure in the fit residuals ( fig  [ fig : modelmaps ] ) , however . in particular , the data show an excess of emission from the southern portion of the disk relative to the model .",
    "the integrated line flux of the residuals is @xmath114% of the @xmath2co and model fluxes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : smaspectra ] ) . given these systematics , and those due to the simplifying assumptions inherent in the molecular disk model ,",
    "the formal errors listed in table  [ tab2 ] likely somewhat underestimate the uncertainties in the best - fit model parameters .",
    "estimates of the total mass of the v4046 sgr close binary , based on radial velocity curves obtained from optical spectroscopy of the double - lined system , range from 1.55  m@xmath44 ( component masses 0.86  m@xmath44 and 0.69  m@xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to 1.78 m@xmath44 ( component masses 0.91  m@xmath44 and 0.87  m@xmath44 ; * ? ? ?",
    "both estimates are based on an assumed binary system inclination of 35@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite component masses appear to be more accurate , given the nearly equal radial velocity amplitudes of the two components and the improved agreement with pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks ( see disussion in * ? ? ?",
    "to ascertain the constraints placed by the sma co maps on both the mass of the central binary and the inclination of the disk , we fixed the remaining disk model parameters to their best - fit ( table  [ tab2 ] ) values , and allowed only central mass and inclination to vary . the results for reduced @xmath27 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ ms_incl ] , illustrate the inherent degeneracy between mass and inclination ; lower central masses and higher inclinations yield fits that are comparable in quality to those for higher central masses and lower inclinations .",
    "nonetheless , this fitting exercise demonstrates that , for a central mass in the range 1.55 to 1.8  m@xmath44 allowed by the optical spectroscopy , the disk inclination is constrained to values between 33@xmath4 and 37@xmath4 .",
    "given the similarity of these values of disk inclination to that assumed for the central binary in determining component masses from stellar radial velocities , it appears that the molecular disk is nearly coplanar with the central binary system .",
    "although smaller central binary masses ( and hence larger disk inclinations ) are not precluded by our disk model fitting  indeed , we find that @xmath27 reaches a minimum near @xmath45 , for a central mass of @xmath11.4  m@xmath44  values of central mass @xmath46  m@xmath44 for this system lead to discord with pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks @xcite .      to estimate the disk molecular mass from the integrated sma @xmath2co and @xmath3co line intensities ( 30.2 jy km s@xmath14 for @xmath2co and 8.7 jy km s@xmath14 for @xmath3co ) we adopt the methods and assumptions described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , we assume optically thin @xmath3co emission and co : h@xmath7 and @xmath2c:@xmath3c ratios of @xmath47 and 89 , respectively ; the latter values are highly uncertain .",
    "we assume the mean gas temperature is similar to that of the dust ( 37  k ; see below ) .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath2co and @xmath3co line intensities indicates a @xmath2co optical depth of @xmath126 .",
    "we use this result to infer a disk molecular mass of @xmath1110 earth masses from the @xmath2co line intensity ( see equation 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "this gas mass estimate is consistent with that obtained for v4046 sgr on the basis of single - dish ( iram 30-m ) data ( @xcite13  earth masses stated in @xcite is an order of magnitude too small . ] ) .",
    "we note that the assumption that the @xmath3co emission is optically thin is supported by the nondetection of c@xmath13o(21 ) emission by the sma , although the large @xmath2co optical depth places a lower limit on the @xmath3co optical depth of @xmath10.4 .    adopting a dust temperature of 37 k",
    " obtained from a blackbody fit to the far - infrared / submillimeter spectral energy distribution of v4046 sgr @xcite  and a dust opacity of 1.15 @xmath48 g@xmath14 ( extrapolated from an opacity of 1.7 @xmath48 g@xmath14 at 880  @xmath49 m assuming a dust opacity slope @xmath50=1 ; see zuckerman et al .",
    "2008 ) , we estimate a disk dust mass of @xmath140 earth masses .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath12 larger than the estimate obtained by @xcite ; the discrepancy is likely due to the adopted power - law dependence of opacity on wavelength .",
    "our @xmath2co(21 ) and @xmath3co(21 ) emission emission maps of v4046 sgr reveal a rotating disk around this binary system extending out to a radius of @xmath1370  au .",
    "a truncated power - law fit to the @xmath2co(21 ) visibilities indicate the disk is viewed at an inclination of 33@xmath4 if the total central binary mass is 1.8  m@xmath44 ( as determined by * ? ? ?",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the central binary mass is as small as 1.55  m@xmath44 ( the value determined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the basis of the sma co data alone , since disk inclinations as large as @xmath140@xmath4 ( corresponding to a central mass of @xmath11.4  m@xmath44 ) are not precluded by the modeling .",
    "while the position angle of the central binary is unknown , the close correspondence between the range of disk inclination determined from the modeling (   4.2 ) and the inclination of the binary star orbit adopted in previous binary system radial velocity studies ( 35@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads us to conclude that the binary pair and disk are nearly coplanar .",
    "the disk and orbital planes of circumbinary disk systems are expected to be very similar , because the system either formed with such an alignment or subsequently evolved into an aligned state @xcite .",
    "it is therefore significant that the disk and binary inclinations indeed appear to be aligned to within a few degrees , in this @xmath112 myr - old system .",
    "we resolved the 1.3 mm continuum emission from v4046 sgr with the sma , and find that the flux is consistent with 37  k dust located @xmath140  au from the central stars @xcite .",
    "we estimate a mass of @xmath140  earth masses of dust in the disk , about a factor of 3 smaller than the gas mass inferred from the co line intensities ( @xmath1110 earth masses , assuming a co : h@xmath7 ratio of 10@xmath51 ) .",
    "hence , either the residual gas mass in the disk orbiting this rather `` old '' binary classical t tauri system is much smaller than that expected for a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , or the disk is severely depleted in gas - phase co. indeed , for the temperature profile adopted here , @xmath52 k for radii @xmath53200 au , suggesting that much of the co present in the disk may be in the form of icy grain mantles .",
    "although it appears most protoplanetary disks have dissipated after several million years @xcite , v4046 sgr , at age @xmath112 myr , still retains a substantial amount of mass in its circumbinary disk .",
    "indeed , v4046 sgr is one of only four known pre - main sequence stars within 100  pc that possess molecular disks . while v4046 sgr is a close binary system , the other three ( tw  hya , hd  141569 , and 49  ceti ) do not appear to harbor close companions .",
    "previous submillimeter studies have revealed gas - rich disks extending out to about 200  au in both tw  hya and 49  ceti @xcite and @xmath1250  au in hd  141569 @xcite .",
    "our sma imaging demonstrates that the v4046 sgr disk ( radius 370  au ) is even larger and , when compared to the disk orbiting tw hya ( a single star of slightly later spectral type ) , also retains a larger gas mass ( if we apply the same standard assumptions of co abundance relative to h@xmath7 of 10@xmath51 and @xmath2c/@xmath3c of 89 ) .",
    "the twin stars in v4046 sgr evidently are still actively accreting from this extensive , gaseous disk and , likewise , any young jovian planets within this system may be undergoing their final stages of gas accretion .",
    "giant planet formation in disks can occur in one of two ways : core accretion , with timescales of a few @xmath54  years @xcite or disk instability , with timescales as short as a few @xmath55  years @xcite .",
    "one expects that long - lived disks such as those around tw hya and v4046 sgr ( ages @xmath110  myr ) will provide more opportunities to form giant planets than shorter - lived disks , regardless of how they form , so long as sufficient reservoirs of gas remain present .",
    "meanwhile , studies have shown that disks around close ( @xmath56100  au ) binary systems tend to dissipate faster than those around single stars or more widely separated systems @xcite .",
    "typically , therefore , if giant planets are to form around close binary systems , they must must form more rapidly than would be necessary for giant planets forming around single stars . indeed",
    ", there is evidence that planets in binary systems with separations @xmath56100  au are biased towards higher masses , possibly as a natural consequence of rapid planet formation via gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "v4046 sgr therefore presents a particularly interesting and important case .",
    "given its tight ( @xmath19  @xmath11 ) separation , the outer portions of its circumbinary disk , where giant planets are expected to form , will have been left relatively undisturbed throughout the system s lifetime . only within @xmath11",
    "au are dynamical effects due to the central binary expected to significantly affect the disk ( @xcite estimate that an inner hole out of radius @xmath10.2  au is necessary to account for the lack of excess infrared emission from v4046 sgr shortward of 10  @xmath49 m ) .",
    "while about 20% of extrasolar planets have been detected in binary systems @xcite , no unambiguous detection of an extrasolar planet has been made for a binary with separation @xmath5620  au ( though the eclipse timings of hw virginis and cm draconis suggest that planets may orbit these two binaries ; * ? ? ?",
