    "this paper is concerned with certain models for random growth and competition on the cubic lattice @xmath0 in dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the richardson model , introduced in richardson ( 1973 ) , is one of the simplest models for growth on @xmath0 .",
    "each site is in either of two states , denoted by 0 and 1 , and the set of sites in state 1 increases to cover all of @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics is that a site in state 0 is transferred to state 1 at a rate proportional to the number of nearest neighbors in state 1 and a site in state 1 remains there forever .",
    "this is equivalent to first - passage percolation with i.i.d .",
    "exponential passage times .    in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998 ) , a generalized version of the richardson model is introduced .",
    "there are now three possible states , denoted by 0 , 1 and 2 respectively , for each site .",
    "a site in state 0 is transferred to state 1 ( 2 ) with rate @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) times the number of nearest neighbors in state 1 ( 2 ) and the states 1 and 2 are absorbing . here",
    "@xmath7 are the parameters of the model .",
    "for disjoint sets @xmath1 , let @xmath8 denote the probability law of the generalized process started at time zero with the sites in @xmath2 being in state @xmath9 , the sites in @xmath3 in state 2 and the rest of @xmath0 in state 0 .",
    "the states 1 and 2 may be thought of as representing two different types of infection and the model then describes the growth of two infections competing for space on @xmath0 .",
    "there are two possible scenarios : either one of the infection types at some point completely surrounds the other , preventing the surrounded type from growing any further , or both infection types keep growing indefinitely .",
    "write @xmath10 for the latter event , that is , @xmath11 if the initial sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are finite , clearly @xmath12 has positive probability . to decide whether @xmath10 has positive probability or not is more intricate .",
    "first , assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath10 should in this case occur with positive probability if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "this intuition is partly confirmed in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998,2000 ) .",
    "the main result in the first paper is that , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 , then @xmath18 . in the second paper",
    "it is proved that , if @xmath4 and @xmath5 is held fixed , then @xmath19 for all but at most countably many values of @xmath6 .",
    "the aim in the present paper is to show that the choice of initial sets is basically irrelevant for these results .",
    "of course , if one set completely surrounds the other , then mutual unbounded growth is ruled out . to formulate our main result",
    ", we therefore employ the following definition .    * definition 1 * let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two disjoint finite subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that one of the sets ( @xmath20 ) _ strangles _ the other ( @xmath21 ) if there exists no infinite self - avoiding path in @xmath0 that starts at a vertex in @xmath21 and that does not intersect @xmath20 .",
    "the pair @xmath22 is said to be _ fertile _ if neither of the sets strangles the other .",
    "the main result is as follows .",
    "[ th : huvudresiii ] let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be two fertile pairs of disjoint finite subsets of @xmath0 . for all choices of @xmath24 , we have @xmath25    this implies that mutual unbounded growth has positive probability when starting from @xmath26 if and only if it occurs with positive probability for every other fertile initial configuration as well . hence the results in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998,2000 ) extend to arbitrary initial sets , as desired .",
    "hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998 ) contains a special case of theorem [ th : huvudresiii ] , namely the case when @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 consist of single sites .",
    "the proof readily extends to the case where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both connected sets .",
    "however , the proof fails to extend to more general initial configurations , and , since it uses planarity , it is unclear whether it extends to the case @xmath27 .",
    "these difficulties are overcome in the present paper .",
    "we mention also that a related model for competing growth in continuous space was studied by deijfen _",
    "et al _ ( 2003 ) , and the results obtained there include a kind of continuum analogue of our main result .",
    "in this section we give a concrete construction of the two - type richardson model that suits our purposes .",
    "we also introduce some notation and formulate a lemma that will be important in the proof of theorem [ th : huvudresiii ] .",
    "to begin with , note that , by time - scaling and symmetry , we may restrict our attention to two - type processes with rates @xmath28 for some @xmath29 . to build up such a process ,",
    "define the distance between two sites @xmath30 and @xmath31 on @xmath0 by @xmath32 , and call two sites nearest neighbors if they are located at distance 1 from each other . independently for each ordered pair @xmath33 of nearest neighbor sites on @xmath0 , associate a unit rate poisson process @xmath34 and , for @xmath35 $ ] , write @xmath36 for the thinning of @xmath34 obtained by removing each poisson occurrence with probability @xmath37 . intuitively , at the times of the occurrences in the process @xmath34 , we imagine that a channel between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is opened so that type 1 infection can be transferred from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , that is ,",
    "if @xmath38 is type 1 infected at such a time , then @xmath39 will become type 1 infected as well .",
    "the type 2 infection is controlled analogously by the process @xmath40 .    to formally define the growth process ,",
    "let @xmath41 denote the set of type @xmath42 infected sites after @xmath43 infections and let @xmath44 denote the time point for the @xmath43th infection . also , for a set @xmath45 , define @xmath46 to be the set of sites in @xmath47 that has at least one nearest neighbor in @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 the sequences @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained inductively as follows :    * let @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "* given @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath44 , define @xmath58 , where + @xmath59 for some pair @xmath33 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 + and @xmath62 is defined analogously but with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath36 and @xmath63 replaced by @xmath64 .",
    "* if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath39 is the site such that @xmath68 . if @xmath69 , then @xmath57 is updated in the same way while @xmath56 is left unchanged .",
    "the set of type @xmath42 infected sites at time @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 and the total set of infected sites at time @xmath72 is @xmath73 . when the initial sets need to be clear from the notation they will be included as superscripts , for instance @xmath74 denotes the set of infected sites at time @xmath72 in a process started from the sets @xmath22 . by standard properties of the poisson process ,",
    "the time until an infected site infects an uninfected nearest neighbor is exponentially distributed and hence @xmath75 is a markov process .",
    "we remark that in the original construction of the two - type richardson model , given in hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998,2000 ) , the type 1 and the type 2 infections are generated by independent poisson processes .",
    "more precisely , to each ordered nearest neighbor pair @xmath33 two independent poisson processes , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with rates 1 and @xmath78 respectively , are attached .",
    "the process @xmath76 then controls the type 1 infection and @xmath77 controls the type 2 infection .",
    "however , in the present article we will always assume that the type 1 and the type 2 infections are generated by the same poisson process as described above",
    ". obviously this gives a growth process with the same distribution as the original one .",
    "one way of describing the evolution of the infection is to study the _ infection graph _ , denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "it consists of two disjoint graphs , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , describing the type 1 and the type 2 infection respectively .",
    "these are generated as follows : for @xmath82 , let @xmath83 be the graph with vertex set @xmath84 and edge set obtained by putting an edge between two nearest neighbor sites @xmath85 if and only if , at some time @xmath86 , @xmath38 was infected by @xmath39 or vice versa .",
    "define @xmath87 , where the limit exists since both the vertex set and the edge set of @xmath83 is increasing in @xmath72 , and let @xmath88 . in",
    "the one - type richardson model started from a single infected site , @xmath79 is a tree and its features have been studied in newman ( 1995 ) and hggstrm and pemantle ( 1998 ) . in general",
    ", @xmath79 is a forest , that is , each connected component is a tree .",
    "clearly mutual unbounded growth for the two infection types in the two - type model occurs if and only if both @xmath80 and @xmath81 contain an infinite path .",
    "the following lemma relates the existence of such paths to the boundary configuration of the initial set . to formulate it ,",
    "extend the notation for the infection graphs to incorporate the initial sets , so that @xmath89 denotes the type @xmath42 infection graph for a process started from @xmath90 .",
    "[ lemma1 ] consider two growth processes with the same infection rates @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and generated by the same poisson processes , but started from two different finite initial configurations @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "assume that @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "* if @xmath94 contains an infinite path , then so does @xmath95 .",
    "* if there is an infinite path in @xmath96 starting at some site @xmath97 , then the same path is present in @xmath98 as well .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "write @xmath99 for the interior of @xmath100 , that is , @xmath101 .",
    "we will show that    @xmath102    and    @xmath103    for all @xmath72 . to this end ,",
    "order the time points for the infections in the two growth processes in one single sequence @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "note that , since the growth processes are generated by the same poisson processes , infections can take place simultaneously in both processes .",
    "hence an infection time @xmath106 can represent an infection that occurs in both processes .",
    "assume that ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) hold for @xmath107 .",
    "the only way for ( [ eq:1 ] ) to fail at @xmath108 is then that a site that is uninfected at time @xmath106 in the process started from @xmath90 becomes type 1 infected in the process started from @xmath91 .",
    "however , it is easily seen that if this should be the case , then the same infection must take place in the process started from @xmath90 as well .",
    "hence , both sets @xmath109 and @xmath110 are extended by the same site and thus ( [ eq:1 ] ) is preserved at time @xmath111 .",
    "analogously it can be seen that ( [ eq:2 ] ) is preserved at @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , by assumption , the type 2 infected part of @xmath112 is a subset of the type 2 infected part of @xmath113 , implying that ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) hold for @xmath114 .",
    "it follows by induction over @xmath43 that the inclusions ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) hold for all @xmath115 and clearly they must then hold for all @xmath116 .",
    "part ( a ) follows immediately from ( [ eq:2 ] ) .    to establish ( b ) , we first show that    @xmath117    to this end , assume that the site @xmath118 is infected at time @xmath119 in the process started from @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath39 is type 1 infected , it follows from ( [ eq:1 ] ) that @xmath39 is ( type 1 ) infected at time @xmath72 in the process started from @xmath90 as well .",
    "so suppose @xmath39 is type 2 infected .",
    "then there is an infection chain with passage time at most @xmath72 that leads from some site in @xmath120 to @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , unless some site in the chain becomes type 1 infected before it is reached by the type 2 infection , the same chain is present also in the process started from @xmath90 .",
    "however , the fact that a site in the chain is type 1 infected can only decrease the time it takes for the infection to reach @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath39 is infected at the latest at time @xmath72 in the process started from @xmath90 and ( [ eq:3 ] ) follows .",
    "now let @xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the vertex and edge set respectively of the infinite path starting at @xmath123 in @xmath96 .",
    "we will call a site @xmath124 _ successful _ in the process started from @xmath91 if it is type 1 infected and infects the site @xmath125 via the edge @xmath126 at the latest at the time when @xmath125 is infected in the process started from @xmath90 . using ( [ eq:3 ] ) , it follows easily by induction over @xmath43 that all vertices in @xmath121 are successful in the process started from @xmath91 .",
    "hence @xmath127 , as desired.@xmath128",
    "we are now in a position to prove theorem [ th : huvudresiii ] . the proof is based on a coupling of the processes @xmath8 and @xmath129 that has certain similarities with the coupling used in the proof of proposition 1.1 in deijfen _",
    "et al _ ( 2003 ) .",
    "the geometrical aspects of our proof are , however , quite different .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ th : huvudresiii ] : _ pick finite sets @xmath130 such that the pairs @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fertile .",
    "we will show that , if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 as well .",
    "interchanging the roles of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the below arguments gives the reverse implication .",
    "as pointed out before , by time - scaling and symmetry , it suffices to consider the case when @xmath133 and @xmath134 , that is , when the type 1 infection has rate 1 and is more powerful than the type 2 infection .    to begin with",
    ", we need some notation . for a finite set @xmath135 ,",
    "let @xmath136 and @xmath137 be the points in @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively , and define @xmath140 that is , @xmath141 is the smallest box that contains the set @xmath47 .",

    "is equipped with a hat - symbol , for instance @xmath150 denotes the set of infected sites at time @xmath72 .",
    "we will describe a scenario for the time interval @xmath151 $ ] in the coupled process that  combined with lemma [ lemma1 ]  guarantees that both infection types grow unboundedly in this process given that they do so in the process started from @xmath22 . to this end , assume that mutual unbounded growth occurs in the process started from @xmath22 , that is , assume that both infection graphs @xmath152 and @xmath153 contain an infinite path .",
