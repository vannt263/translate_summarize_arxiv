    "the hydrogen bonding strength for these two base pairs is not same as the at base pair has two hydrogen bonds while gc base pair has three hydrogen bonds",
    ". the approximate ratio of gc and at bond strengths varies from 1.2 to 1.5 as mentioned by various research groups @xcite . in the absence of the complementary base on the opposite strand ,",
    "the pairing between the two bases is absent .",
    "this site is called a _ defect site _ because of an absence of a stable ( or non - existing ) bonding between these two bases on the opposite strands @xcite .",
    "the presence of defects in dna is related to interesting physics and biochemistry of the molecule .",
    "the dynamics of these defects may delay the replication process and hence lead to the breathing dynamics of opening of the chain @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that in embryonic cells , these delays may cause the _ cell death _ while in mature cells like somatic cells , this damage ( defect ) may be an initiation step in the development of cancer @xcite .",
    "these defects are present in the dna based actuators .",
    "the role of the defects in the designing of molecular motor has been discussed by mccullagh _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "how the defects affect the melting , elastic and other properties are problem of scientific interest .",
    "there are many paths to explore the role of the defects and the damage repair mechanism in the living cells .",
    "theoretical approach to investigate the problem routes via molecular dynamics or model based calculations @xcite .",
    "our approach is a model based calculation .",
    "we use peyrard bishop dauxois ( pbd ) model @xcite to investigate the thermal and mechanical denaturation of dna molecules in presence of defects .",
    "the main objective of the current study is to investigate the effect of density and location of defects on the denaturation of dna molecule .    in experiments , researchers synthesis and/or characterize the samples to decipher the information stored by that sample .",
    "accordingly , we choose four samples of dna molecules each containing 16 base pairs .",
    "all these samples have different numbers and distribution of _ at - gc _ pairs .",
    "we identify all these molecules according to the distribution of base pairs and named them as follows : _ chain 1 : 3-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-5 _ ( homogeneous ) , _ chain 2 : 3-agagagagagagagag-5 _ ( alternating @xmath0 pairs ) , _ chain 3 : 3-aaaaaaaagggggggg-5 _ ( 50%@xmath1 + 50%@xmath2 ) , _ chain 4 : 3-tccctagacttaggga-5 _ ( random sequence ) .",
    "the prime motivation behind the selection of different kinds of sequences is to predict the role of defect(s ) in the melting or unzipping of different kinds of dna molecules .",
    "the next task is to introduce the defect in the model .",
    "we have continued from our previous approach @xcite where the defect in the model was introduced via morse potential that represent the hydrogen bonding .",
    "if a pair has a defect that means there is an absence of hydrogen bond and this feature is reflected from the absence of potential depth while retaining the repulsive part of the potential in order to avoid the crossing of two bases in a pair ( see fig .",

    "( color online ) the on - site potential for the defect in a pair is shown by square symbol and dashed ( red ) line . while for the bases in a pair is represented by the depth of the potential ( solid line with black circle ) , there is no minimum of potential for the defect pair @xcite.,width=240,height=216 ]    we present the work in different sections . in section [ model ] , we provide a brief description of the model and methodology used in this work . the effect of defect(s ) on thermal denaturation of dsdna molecule",

    "one can take the variable @xmath9 according to the distribution of bases along the strand @xcite .",
    "a defect in a pair will modify the electronic distribution around the bases hence the stacking parameters .",

    "the configurational part of the partition function can be integrated numerically with the help of matrix multiplication method @xcite .",
    "the important part of this integration is the selection of proper cut - offs for the integral appearing in eq.5 to avoid the divergence of the partition function .",
    "the method to identify the proper cut - off has been discussed by several groups @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we observed that in order to get precise value of melting temperature ( @xmath28 ) one has to choose the large grid points .",
    "we found that 900 is quite sufficient number for this purpose .",
    "as all matrices in eq.[eqn6 ] are identical in nature the multiplication is done very efficiently .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities of interest can be calculated by evaluating the helmholtz free energy of the system .",
    "the free energy per base pair is , @xmath32 the thermodynamic quantities like specific heat ( @xmath33 ) as a function of temperature or the applied force can be evaluated by taking the second derivative of the free energy .",
    "the peak in the specific heat corresponds to the melting temperature or the critical force of the system .",
    "other quantities such as the average fraction @xmath34 of bonded ( or open ) base pairs can be calculated by introducing the dsdna ensemble(dsdnae ) @xcite or using the phenomenological approach @xcite . in general , the @xmath35 is defined as , @xmath36 @xmath37 is the average fraction of strands forming duplexes , while @xmath38 is the average fraction of unbroken bonds in the duplexes .",
    "the opening of long and short chains are completely different . for long chains ,",
    "when the fraction of open base pairs , @xmath39 , goes practically from 0 to 1 at the melting transition , the two strands are not yet completely separated . at this point",
    ", the majority of the bonds are disrupted and the dsdna is denaturated , but the few bonds still remaining intact , preventing the two strands parting from each other . only at high temperatures will there be a real separation .",
    "therefore for very long chains the double strand is always a single macromolecule through the transition , thus one can calculate the fraction of intact or broken base pairs only . for short chains ,",
    "the process of single bond disruption and strand dissociation tend to happen in the same temperature range .",
    "thus , the computation of both @xmath38 and @xmath37 is essential @xcite .",

    "the melting temperatures for _ chain 1 , 2 , 3 , & 4 _ without any defect are 447.5 , 508.8 , 511.0 and 509.8 k , respectively .",
    "let us now consider the _ chain 1 _ with one defect .",
    "when the first site ( @xmath45- end ) is a defect pair , the melting temperature is about 433 k. the melting temperature further reduces to 432 k if the @xmath46 pair is a defect pair .",
    "however there is something interesting to note after this . when the location of defect is @xmath47 pair onward ( towards @xmath48- end ) the melting temperature reduces to 430 k and remains constant till we reach @xmath49 site .",

    "the location of defect site , whether it is @xmath1 or @xmath2 pair , is important .",
    "the energy landscape of this chain is not smooth over the complete length because of the difference in the dissociation energies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs . for single defect that move from position 1 to 16",
    ", @xmath28 shows a zig - zag pattern and @xmath28 varies between a range of 496 k to 487 k. when we consider two consecutive defects in the chain this pattern is lost because of the loss in the sequence heterogeneity .",
    "this can be thought of as reviving the homogeneous structure of the dna molecule with the dual pair having an average of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pair s dissociation energies .",
    "however , the necklace pattern obtained for this case is not as symmetric as observed for the _ chain 1 _ since the end pairs are not same .",
    "remember at @xmath45- end there is an @xmath1 pair while on @xmath48- end , there is a @xmath2 pair . for this chain",
    ", @xmath28 varies between 485 k to 476 k. the zig - zag pattern is retained when three consecutive defects are introduced . however , the @xmath28 is lower as compared to the chain with one defect . again with four consecutive defects",
    "an asymmetric necklace is observed with short plateau .",
    "let us consider _ chain 3 _ , that is having @xmath52 pairs in the sequence , with one defect . in this case , we obtain a hook kind of structure in the plot .",
    "a sudden drop in the @xmath28 is observed in the middle of the chain ( on @xmath53 pair ) at the interface of _ gc _ & _ at _ pair .",
    "the smoothness at the interface increases with increase in the number of defects in the chain . as the number of defect increases , on the interface the effect of presence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs diminishes .",
    "next is , _ chain 4 _ that is having a random distribution of _ at / gc _ pairs . due to random distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs",
    ", the energy landscape is also random .",
    "hence the fluctuation in the values of @xmath28 should also be random .",
    "this is observed in the figure .",
    "the random pattern of the plot varies with number of defects in the molecule .",
    "let us observe the single defect on 4,5 , & 6 sites .",
    "while @xmath28 is 488 k for @xmath47 site , it is 495 k for @xmath54 & @xmath55 sites . for two consecutive defects in the molecule ,",
    "this is averaged to 478 k , _",
    "i.e._. this is because of the indistinguishability of _ at _ and _ gc _ pair .",
    "similarly , for three ( consecutive ) defects in the molecule , the high barrier on _ 11 _ & _ 12 _ sites , is lost .",
    "the pattern observed for this chain is closer to the real sequences .",
    "the replication process is initiated by the force exerted by dna polymerase on a segment of dna chain ( owcarzy fragment ) .",
    "the replication starts at some site which is called replication origin @xcite and the replication fork propagates bidirectionally .",
    "the defect or mismatch pair(s ) may slow or stall the replication process . in the case",
    "if the mismatch repair system does not work properly cell may die @xcite .",
    "mathematically one can model the replication as the force applied on an end of the dna chain @xcite .",
    "physics of opening of chain due to thermal fluctuation and mechanical forces is completely different @xcite .",
    "thus , the study on the mismatch in the sequence and its role in the replication process is an interesting way to look into the physics of a complex mechanism . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the force induced unzipping in dna molecules in presence of defect(s ) .",
    "the modified hamiltonian for the dna that is pulled mechanically from an end is , @xmath56 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\left[w_s(y_i , y_{i+1})\\right ] -f\\cdot y_1\\ ] ] where the force @xmath57 is applied on the @xmath58 pair @xcite .",
    "whereas in thermal denaturation , the opening is due to increase in the entropy of the system , for mechanically stretched dna chain the opening is enthalpic .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities , of interest , from the modified hamiltonian can be calculated using eq .",
    "[ eqn5 ] & [ eqn6 ] . here",
    "we consider the same four chains that we considered for thermal denaturation studies .",
    "all the base pairs of dsdna that is kept in a thermal bath share equal amount of energy . in the case",
    "when the chain is pulled from an end , the amount of force decreases from the pulling point to the other end of the chain .",
    "thus the location of defect(s ) should have different impact on the opening of the chain that is subjected to a mechanical pull from an end .",
    "let us consider _ chain 1 _ with one defect . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] when the force is applied on the @xmath45 -end and the defect pair is @xmath58 pair ( @xmath45 -end ) , the critical force reduces to 4.04 pn from 4.54 pn .",
    "this value further decreases to 3.99 pn when the defect pair is @xmath46 pair .",
    "when the defect is located between 3 - 13 pairs , there is no change in the value of critical force , it is @xmath503.97 pn .",
    "this means that the base pair ( defected ) in this section of the chain have similar response to the applied force , irrespective of their location .",
    "the defect pair means a loop in the chain which will increase the entropy of the chain . from the results ,",
    "this is clear that the loop contributes to the opening of the chain in addition to the applied force and end entropy .",
    "however , as the defect location is somewhere between 14 to 16 , contribution of bubble in the entropy of the chain is negligible . hence the critical force increases . in this case too , we observe a necklace pattern .",
    "the pattern obtained here is not as symmetric as observed for thermal melting of the same chain with single defect .",
    "the reason for this difference lies in the nature of the chain opening in these two cases .",
    "we consider now the opening of the chain in another condition .",
    "the force is applied on @xmath45 -end and defect pair is the @xmath48 -end . in this case , the critical force is 4.02 pn which is less than for the previous case ( where the force is on @xmath45 -end and defect pair is also @xmath45 -end ) where @xmath59 is 4.04 pn .",
    "the difference is about 0.02 pn .",
    "the reason for this reduction is the difference in the end entropies for these two cases . in case",
    "when the defect end is @xmath48- end , the entropy of this open end contributes to the opening . while for the first case , when the defect end is the @xmath45 -end ( the force is also on this end ) , the contribution from the @xmath48 -end will be less as it is an intact pair .",
    "hence we need slightly higher force to open the chain for the first case .",
    "we obtained similar results for this chain with more defects ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "for all the investigations whenever @xmath61 , all the defects are consecutive defects .",
    "as the number of defects increases in the chain , the difference in the @xmath59 for two different cases is greater . in order to verify our arguments ,",
    "we calculate the probabilities of opening of the base pairs for these two cases .",
    "the probability of opening of the @xmath15 pair , in a sequence is defined as @xcite : @xmath62 z_j\\ ] ] where @xmath63\\ ] ] while @xmath64 is the configurational part of the partition function defined as in eq.[eqn5 ] . for @xmath65",
    ", we have taken a value of 2 @xmath66 . to avoid the overflow of figures ,",
    "we choose to display the surface plot for _ chain 1 _ with 4 defects , see fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] .",
    "we observe that the difference in the critical force for these two cases is @xmath67 pn .",
    "let us consider , the _ chain 2 _ ( alternating @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs ) . in this case , we have four possible combinations of force and defect locations .",
    "first , when force is applied on @xmath45 -end and the defect is also at the @xmath45 -end .",
    "second one is when force is applied on @xmath45 -end and defect is at @xmath48 -end .",
    "the other two cases are the alternate combinations of these two .",
    "if we fix the location of applied force at @xmath45 -end and change the defect locations , we find that for single defect the difference in @xmath59 is @xmath68 pn .",
    "this is because of the difference in the entropy contribution from the two ends . in one case",
    "the end is @xmath1 while in another case it is @xmath2 .",
    "if we fix the defect location and change the applied force locations from @xmath45 -end to @xmath48 -end , we find that the difference in @xmath59 is @xmath69 pn . the same argument which we gave for _ chain 1 _ with single defect is valid here too .",
    "now consider this chain with two defects .",
    "when the force is applied on @xmath45 -end and the defect locations are @xmath45 -end and @xmath48 -end , the difference in @xmath59 is @xmath67 pn .",
    "this chain with two defects can be thought of as a homogeneous chain ( of @xmath70 block ) with single defect .",
    "however , the ends in this chain can be either @xmath1 or @xmath2 and hence we get a different pattern at the ends as compare to _",
    "chain 1_. similar kind of feature is observed for the same chain with four defects . for the _ chain 3 _",
    ", the difference in the energy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pair is clearly visible . in this case , this is important on which end the force is applied .",
    "when the force is applied on @xmath45 -end and the defect locations are @xmath45 -end and @xmath48 -end the difference in the @xmath59 is @xmath71 pn . the _ chain 4 _ is a chain with random distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs .",
    "since the distribution is random the energy landscape of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs will play an important role in the opening of chain with different locations of defect .",
    "the unzipping behavior of this chain displays some of the features of all the three chains that we considered above . in case when the defect(s ) are in the middle of the chain , the change in the value of critical force is negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ , it does not matter from which end the chain is pulled .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the role of defect(s ) on the thermal as well as mechanical denaturation of dna molecule .",
    "it is known that the defects delay the replication process which may further cause the cell death and hence may lead to initiation of cancer .",
    "motivated by the experimental studies , we considered four different kind of dna molecules .",
    "these molecules have different numbers of _ at _ and _ gc _ pairs and the distribution of these pairs along the chain is also different . we have considered all the chains with @xmath7 number of defects , where @xmath7 varies from 1 - 4 . here we assumed that for @xmath61 all the defects are in a block .",
    "for the equilibrium calculations , we used pbd model and found the denaturation point in thermal as well as in constant force ensembles . for the homogeneous chain , we found that there is a segment ( 4 - 12 ) of the chain where @xmath28 is unaffected by the location of the defect in the chain . in case of heterogeneous chain",
    ", there is no plateau but it matters on a location whether there is an _ at _ pair or a _ gc _ pair . when we compared the opening in two ensembles for homogeneous chain we observed that there is a striking difference . while for the homogeneous chain we obtained a symmetric necklace kind of plot in thermal ensemble , this was missing in force ensemble .",
    "this validates the role of finite end entropy of the homogeneous chain in the denaturation of the dna molecule . for the thermal melting",
    "the ends have less impact on the opening because of the fact that each base pair shares the same amount of thermal energy .",
    "there only the sequence of @xmath51 pairs matters .    for the chain that is pulled from an end by some force , it is important for all kinds of chains ( with defect ) whether the force is applied on @xmath45- end or @xmath48- end . for unzipping in constant force ensemble we considered four possible cases",
    "first two are when force is applied on @xmath45- end and the defect locations are either on @xmath45- or @xmath48- ends .",
    "similarly other two combinations are when the force is applied on @xmath48- end and defect locations are either @xmath45- or @xmath48- ends . in all these cases ,",
    "the nature of end pair is important . for the chain with alternate @xmath1 and @xmath2 sequence we observed that in addition to the ends the interface of defect and intact pair affect the opening of the chain .",
    "the interfaces for this chain with two defects are either of @xmath72 or @xmath73 kind .",
    "hence there is a difference in the critical force for the four cases . to show the importance of ends in the opening we calculated the probabilities of opening for the homogeneous chain with four defects",
    "here we considered two cases ; one when the force is applied on @xmath45- end and defects are either at @xmath45- end or at @xmath48- end . when the defect location is @xmath45- end , the end entropy is suppressed and hence we obtained a slightly higher critical force for this case .",
    "the studies on _ chain 4 _ are closer to the real chain as it has random sequence of _ at _ and _ gc _ pairs . the force profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ) shows the weak and strong sections of the chain . as a future of this work",
    ", one can study the opening of dna molecule in both the ensemble as a function of time and the exact delay in the opening can be predicted .",
    "this is an attempt to understand the defect and their effect on the replication process .",
    "however , the real picture would be clearer from non - equilibrium studies .",
    "how the cell decides which segment of dna with a mismatch in the sequence can be repaired or which would be destroyed will be an interesting area of future studies .",
    "is there any role of free energies of the sequence ?",

    "<S> we calculate the probability of opening of the dna molecule in the constant force ensemble to explain the opening of base pairs and hence the denaturation of molecules in the presence of defects . </S>"
