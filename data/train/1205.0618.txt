    "harvesting energy from the environment is a promising approach to prolong the lifetime of energy constrained wireless networks . among other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind , background radio - frequency ( rf ) signals radiated by ambient transmitters",
    "can be a viable new source for wireless power transfer ( wpt ) .",
    "on the other hand , rf signals have been widely used as a vehicle for wireless information transmission ( wit ) .",
    "simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) becomes appealing since it realizes both useful utilizations of rf signals at the same time , and thus potentially offers great convenience to mobile users .",
    "simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels has been studied in @xcite .",
    "varshney first proposed the idea of transmitting information and energy simultaneously in @xcite .",
    "a capacity - energy function was proposed to characterize the fundamental performance tradeoff for simultaneous information and power transfer . in @xcite , grover and",
    "sahai extended the work in @xcite to frequency - selective channels with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a non - trivial tradeoff exists for information transfer versus energy transfer via power allocation .",
    "wireless information and power transfer subject to co - channel interference was studied in @xcite , in which optimal designs to achieve different outage - energy tradeoffs as well as rate - energy tradeoffs are derived .",
    "different from the traditional view of taking interference as an undesired factor that jeopardizes the wireless channel capacity , in @xcite interference was utilized as a source for energy harvesting .",
    "unlike @xcite , which considered point - to - point single - antenna transmission , @xcite considered multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems for swipt .",
    "in particular , @xcite studied the performance limits of a three - node mimo broadcasting system , where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information from the signals sent by a common transmitter .",
    "@xcite extended the work in @xcite by considering imperfect channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter .",
    "mimo relay systems involving an energy harvesting receiver were studied in @xcite , in which the joint optimal source and relay precoders were designed to achieve different tradeoffs between the energy transfer and the information rates .",
    "swipt for multi - user systems was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for multiple access channels with a received energy constraint , time - sharing is necessary to achieve the maximum sum - rate when the received energy constraint is sufficiently large ; while for the multi - hop channel with a harvesting relay , the transmission strategy depends on the quality of the second link .",
    "networks that involve wireless power transfer were studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied a hybrid network which overlays an uplink cellular network with randomly deployed power beacons that charge mobiles wirelessly . under an outage constraint on the data links ,",
    "the tradeoffs between the network parameters were derived . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated a cognitive radio network powered by opportunistic wireless energy harvesting , where mobiles from the secondary network either harvest energy from nearby transmitters in a primary network , or transmit information if the primary transmitters are far away . under an outage constraint for coexisting networks ,",
    "the throughput of the secondary network was maximized .    despite the recent interest in swipt ,",
    "there remains two key challenges for practical implementations .",
    "first , it is assumed in @xcite that the receiver is able to observe and extract power simultaneously from the same received signal .",
    "however , this assumption may not hold in practice , as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly .",
    "due to this potential limitation , the results in @xcite actually provided only optimistic performance bounds . to coordinate wit and wpt at the receiver side , two practical schemes ,",
    "namely , time switching ( ts ) and static power splitting ( sps ) , were proposed in @xcite .",
    "second , the conventional information receiver architecture designed for wit may not be optimal for swipt , due to the fact that wit and wpt operate with very different power sensitivity at the receiver ( e.g. , -10dbm for energy receivers versus -60dbm for information receivers ) . thus , for a system that involves both wit and wpt , the receiver architecture",
    "should be optimized for wpt .",
    "in addition , circuit power consumed by information decoding becomes a significant design issue for simultaneous information and power transfer , since the circuit power reduces the net harvested energy that can be stored in the battery for future use . in particular , the active mixers used in conventional information receiver for rf to baseband conversion are substantially power - consuming .",
    "it thus motivates us to propose new receiver architectures which consume less power by avoiding the use of active devices .    in this paper",
    ", we study practical receiver designs for a point - to - point wireless link with simultaneous information and power transfer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] ) .",
    "we generalize the ts and sps schemes proposed in @xcite to a general receiver operation scheme , namely , _ dynamic power splitting _ ( dps ) , by which the signal is dynamically split into two streams with arbitrary power ratio over time @xcite . besides ts and sps ,",
    "another special case of the dps scheme , namely , _ on - off power splitting _ ( ops ) is also investigated .",
    "the ts and sps schemes can be treated as special cases of the ops scheme .",
    "based on dps , we first consider the _ separated _ receiver architecture ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seprx ] ) based on a conventional information - decoding architecture . in this architecture , the received signal by the antenna is split into two signal streams in the rf band , which are then separately fed to the conventional energy receiver and information receiver for harvesting energy and decoding information , respectively .",
    "note that the receivers in @xcite implicitly employ the separated receiver architecture .",
    "instead , we propose an _ integrated _ receiver architecture ( see fig . [",
    "fig : intrx ] ) , in which we integrate the information decoding and the energy harvesting circuits . in this architecture ,",
    "the active rf band to baseband conversion in conventional information decoding is replaced by a passive rectifier operation , which is conventionally used only for energy harvesting . by providing a dual use of the rectifier , the energy cost for information decoding is reduced significantly .",
    "the rate - energy performances for the two proposed receivers are further characterized by a so - called rate - energy ( r - e ) region . with receiver circuit power consumption taken into account",
    ", it is shown that the ops scheme is optimal for both receivers .",
    "for the ideal case when the consumed power at the receiver is negligible , the sps scheme is optimal for both receivers .",
    "finally , the performance for the two receivers are compared under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation .",
    "the results show that for a system with zero - net - energy consumption , the integrated receiver achieves more rate than separated receiver at sufficiently small transmission distance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : system model ] presents the system model .",
    "section [ sec : architecture ] proposes the two receiver architectures .",
    "section [ sec : separated receivers ] and section [ sec : integrated receivers ] study the rate - energy performance for the separated and integrated receivers , respectively . section [ sec : circuit power ] extends the results in sections [ sec : separated receivers ] and [ sec : integrated receivers ] to the case with receiver circuit power taken into consideration .",
    "section [ sec : practical modulation ] studies the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : system model ] , this paper studies a point - to - point wireless link with simultaneous information and power transfer .",
    "both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with one antenna . at the transmitter side ,",
    "the complex baseband signal is expressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the amplitude and the phase of @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath13 .",
    "the transmitted signal propagates through a wireless channel with channel gain @xmath14 and phase shift @xmath15 .",
    "the equivalent complex channel is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the noise @xmath17 after the receiving antenna can be modeled as a narrow - band ( with bandwidth @xmath4 and center frequency @xmath11 ) gaussian noise , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting the in - phase and quadrature noise components , respectively .",
