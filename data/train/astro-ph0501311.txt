    "ring galaxies represent a class of colliding galaxies in which nearly symmetrical density waves are driven into a disk as a result of an almost bulls - eye collision with a compact galaxy @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations reproduce some of the basic features observed in ring galaxies , such as rings or crescent - shaped structures @xcite .",
    "expanding density waves trigger star formation ( sf ) , and hence a star - forming ring is expected to form in ring galaxies .",
    "the star - forming ring propagates outward with time , leaving behind an evolved stellar population in its wake .",
    "tracers of massive short - lived stars ( e.g. h@xmath0  emission ) are expected to delineate the present position of the wave , while tracers of the remnants of massive stars ( e.g. nonthermal radio continuum ) are expected to illuminate the regions in the wake of the expanding wave .",
    "initial gas density distribution , and the velocity of the wave , would determine the shapes of the radial intensity profiles in the tracers of the young and old components @xcite .",
    "the cartwheel is among the biggest known ring galaxies , in both angular and linear size , and is considered to be the prototype of a ring galaxy . at a distance of 137  mpc ( @xmath2 = 65  kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 ) , its angular size of 72  corresponds to a linear diameter of 48  kpc .",
    "the entire population of bright hii  regions lies in the outer ring , with more than 80% of the current sf occurring in a few hii  complexes in the southern sector of the ring ( higdon 1995 , hereafter h95 ) .",
    "there are , however , a few faint regions inside @xcite .",
    "h95 derived a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 67  @xmath1(159  @xmath1for the h@xmath4 adopted in this work ) , based on h@xmath0  flux , which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that derived from far infrared ( fir ) flux .",
    "some of this discrepancy is probably due to problems in the h95 calibration of h@xmath0  fluxes ( j. l. higdon 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we have carried out sensitive 20  cm radio continuum ( rc ) observations using the very large array ( vla ) with the goal of detecting nonthermal emission in the wake of the wave .",
    "we also carried out new h@xmath0  observations in order to resolve the discrepancy between the sfrs derived from h@xmath0 , and fir luminosity .",
    "we present details of the new observations in section  2 . in section  3",
    ", we describe the observed radio structures and also discuss the sfrs derived from h@xmath0 , fir and rc fluxes . in section  4 , we discuss the results obtained from these new observations from the context of expanding wave models .",
    "rc observations at 20 cm were carried out with the bna configuration of the vla during 2002 may and june , spread over seven runs totaling 35 hr of integration time .",
    "the flux scale , antenna gain , and phase constants were calibrated using observations of standards 0137 + 331 ( 16.32  jy at 1.38  ghz ) and 0025@xmath5260 ( 8.70  jy at 1.38  ghz ) .",
    "data for each run were calibrated before combining them to produce the final map . the final cleaned and self - calibrated maps have almost a circular beam of fwhm of @xmath6 ( p.a.=@xmath7 ) .",
    "several maps with different weight parameters and de - convolved beam sizes were obtained .",
    "some maps were only cleaned and others were the result of several iterations of self - calibration with different restoring beam sizes .",
    "the rms or @xmath8 noise of our final image is 30@xmath9jybeam@xmath3 , which is an improvement by around a factor of 4 over previous observations ( higdon 1996 , hereafter h96 ) .",
    "although some of the radio structures that we discuss here are at the nominal 3@xmath8 limit or just below it , we believe that these structures are true because of their presence in various trial maps we had produced during the reduction process .",
    "new h@xmath0  ccd imaging observations were carried out during one photometric night ( 2003 , september 30 ) at the mcdonald observatory ( texas ) with a 30@xmath10 telescope .",
    "we used three interference filters : 6700/123 , 6560/100 , and 6670/82 , designated so for their central wavelengths and widths , both in units of  .",
    "the first one intercepts the redshifted h@xmath0  line from the galaxy ( 6761 ) , and the other two filters facilitate subtraction of the continuum flux entering the h@xmath0  filter .",
    "we took two exposures of the galaxy ( totaling 35 minutes ) as well as the standard stars in each filter .",
    "the exposures of the galaxy were bracketed in time and zenith distance by the calibration stars ltt377 and ltt1020 @xcite .",
    "the measured total rc and h@xmath0  fluxes , along with errors on our measurements are given in table  1 .",
    "our 20  cm flux is in good agreement with the value published by h96 ( 11.5 mjy ) .",

    "it can be seen in figure  1 that the rc morphology of the cartwheel resembles very much the morphology of the ring in h@xmath0  emission .",
    "radio emission is detected from at least 13 hii  complexes .",
    "these complexes are among the brightest 15 in h@xmath0  emission ( brighter than @xmath24  ergscm@xmath18s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the two non - detected sources ( cw-6 and cw-29 of h95 ) are among the regions with the highest h@xmath0  equivalent widths , suggesting that they are most likely too young to turn - on nonthermal rc emission .",
    "faint emission is also detected at the nuclear position ( fig .  1",
    ", _ cross _ ) . in the bright southern part of the ring ,",
    "the rc image shows at least seven finger - like structures that seem to originate from parts of the ring near bright hii  regions , and point radially inward to the geometrical center of the ring , giving the appearance of spokes of the wheel .",
    "the most prominent spoke originates from close to cw-17 , the brightest hii   region in the cartwheel .",
    "this is the only spoke that had been detected in previous rc images ( h96 ) .",
    "the spoke originating near cw-20 crosses the ring , although with a slight change in the direction .",
    "interestingly , the hyperluminous x - ray source reported by @xcite coincides with this region .",
    "are the rc spokes related to their optical counterparts ?",
    "the first impression from figure 1(b ) , is that the relation between the two , if any , is weak .",
    "the rc spokes are short and straight , whereas the stellar spokes connect the two rings of the cartwheel by a curved path .",
    "the brightest rc spoke has no correspondence to any optical spoke even when extrapolated inward .",
    "of the other six rc spokes , only one ( corresponding to cw-10 ) , when extrapolated inward meets an optical spoke . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the weak rc emission interior to the main ring seems to coincide with the brightest points of the stellar spokes .",
    "so it is possible that the rc spokes are also longer and curved like their optical counterparts , but we have detected only the bright part of that .",
    "clearly , deeper rc images are required to address this question .    the azimuthal distribution of nonthermal rc intensities , and the thermal fraction , in three successive radial zones , one corresponding to the position of the ring ( radius=36 ) , and the other two positioned 6  on either side of the ring , are plotted in figures  2(a  c ) .",
    "each zone has a width of 6 .",
    "the thermal rc flux is calculated from extinction corrected h@xmath0  flux using the relation given by @xcite for an electron temperature of 15000  k @xcite , and visual extinction a@xmath251.2  mag .",
    "the azimuthal rc intensity profile of the ring illustrates a well - known fact : regions in the southern part of the ring ( pa = 120240@xmath26 ) are several times brighter than elsewhere in the ring .",
    "the spokes stand out in the azimuthal profile of the annular zone in the wake of the ring .",
    "the rc emission from the spokes is predominantly nonthermal .",
    "the azimuthal profile exterior to the ring resembles that of the ring .",
    "however , unlike in the ring where 820% of the observed rc flux of hii  complexes is of thermal origin , it is less than 2% in the external zone except for the region just outside cw-12 .",
    "fir , h@xmath0  and 20 cm rc fluxes have been extensively used as tracers of sfr in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fir flux , as defined in @xcite , is calculated for the cartwheel using the iras 60 and 100@xmath9 m fluxes from @xcite .",
    "the resulting value is given in table  1 , along with the h@xmath0   and 20  cm rc flux measured in this work .",
    "sfrs are derived from the luminosities in fir , h@xmath0  and 20  cm rc bands using the relations given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "additive constants that convert log(luminosity ) of row 2 to log(sfr ) are @xmath59.27 , @xmath541.05 , and @xmath520.98 for fir , h@xmath0  and 20  cm rc bands , respectively .",
    "the rc conversion factor depends on the nonthermal power - law index @xmath0 .",
    "a value of @xmath27 is used in this work , which is based on the measurement for two of the brightest hii  regions in the cartwheel ( h96 ) . in all these relations the initial mass function ( imf ) from @xcite",
    "use of salpeter imf would decrease the sfrs by 16% @xcite .    in order to calculate the sfr from h@xmath0  fluxes",
    ", we need to correct for the internal extinction in hii  regions",
    ". maximum value of a@xmath28 allowed by the observed mean colors of the ring is 1.3  mag @xcite , as compared to a@xmath29  mag measured for the brightest hii  region . in the last three rows of table  1 ,",
    "sfrs are tabulated for a@xmath250 , 1.2 and 1.7 mag respectively .",
    "fir - derived sfr is independent of extinction , where as the sfr derived from nonthermal rc flux is weakly dependent on extinction , which is due to the fact that it is obtained by subtracting the thermal component from the total , and that the thermal component is calculated from the extinction - corrected h@xmath0flux . for a@xmath251.2mag",
    ", sfr derived from h@xmath0   agrees with that from fir , whereas the rc gives around 30% more sfr . the thermal contribution to the global rc flux",
    "is 10% , which is in good agreement with the value found for star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "an sfr of 18@xmath1  for the cartwheel compares well with the sfrs of other collisionally formed ring galaxies and interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "rc emission of star - forming galaxies is correlated with the fir emission .",
    "hence 30% excess sfr derived from rc implies that 30% of the detected rc emission is not related to sf .",
    "what is the reason for this excess rc emission in the cartwheel ?",
    "a comparison of the rc and h@xmath0  morphologies suggests that the regions with excess rc emission are cw-20 , cw-24 and the outer boundaries of these regions .",
    "non - thermal radio emission not associated with sf has been discovered in shocked regions in a number of interacting galaxies , including in the intersection of the two merging galaxies forming antennae @xcite .",
    "considering that the ring in the cartwheel is expanding at high velocities , it is reasonable to think that the shocked gas contributes to a part of the observed nonthermal rc emission .",
    "however , published hi data of the cartwheel , do not show evidence of high velocities suggestive of shocks in these regions .",
    "this implies that the neutral gas is not coming from the same region as the shocked ionized gas .",
    "the expanding density wave is expected to leave in its wake old stars and remnants of massive stars .",
    "non - thermal rc emission originates in supernova remnants , which trace stars that are formed @xmath301050  myr ago ( lifetime of stars more massive than 9  @xmath31  at z = z@xmath32/10 ) .",
    "hence nonthermal rc emission from spokes represent the trajectory of the star - forming wave over the past @xmath3050  myr .",
    "intensity distribution along the spokes has valuable information on the past sf process , and can be used to constrain the models of sf in an expanding density wave . in figure  3(a ) , we plot the radial profiles of rc and h@xmath0  intensities expected from models of sf in an expanding density wave . in particular , we used the @xcite model , in which the density wave is assumed to be of gaussian shape @xmath33  kpc , propagating at 90  km  s@xmath3 in an exponential gas disk of scale - length of 20  kpc . a schmidt law with power law index n=1.5 is used to scale gas density to sfr .",
    "the rc emission , which traces stars formed @xmath3050  myr ago , lags behind the h@xmath0  peak , which marks the current location of the wave , by about 2 .",
    "we have carried out a series of tests , and confirmed that the predicted displacements in the peak positions of the profiles should be seen even at the spatial resolution of our rc image .",
    "we obtained radial intensity cuts on the h@xmath0  and rc images , passing through the ring center ( marked by a small circle in figure  1 ) and the rc detected parts of the ring .",
    "all the resulting profiles resemble one of the three representative profiles of figure  3(b - d ) .",
    "the majority of the rc profiles are skewed inward as compared to the h@xmath0   profile , with the peaks of the two profiles coinciding as in ( b ) . in some directions , the rc emission peaks outside the h@xmath0  profile ( c ) .",
    "rc and h@xmath0  profiles of the brightest hii  complex ( cw-17 ) are identical except that the former is broader .",
    "surprisingly , none of the regions show the expected inward shift of the rc profile with respect to h@xmath0  profile .",
    "the profiles skewed inward correspond to the zones where spokes are detected in the wake of the wave , where as profiles skewed outward are basically zones where radio emission extends outside the h@xmath0  ring . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "shocks ahead of the wave are responsible for the rc emission in these zones .    in the cartwheel , the @xmath34-band intensity profile , which traces the red supergiant stars that are formed about 1020",
    "myr ago , is found to peak marginally inside the h@xmath0  profile @xcite .",
    "the displacements , are consistent with a wave velocity of @xmath35  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the displacements were not noted along the minor axis cuts , which @xcite explained as due to orientation effects .",
    "hii  regions cw-6 and cw-28 are along the major axis , both of which contain radially directed rc spokes , but the expected 2  shift in the position of peak of the rc emission can not be noted .",
    "the lack of radial separation between the rc and h@xmath0  profiles calls for a revision of the physical ingredients that go into the models , especially in the treatment of sf and feedback effects .",
    "the observed profile shapes imply that the sfr increased to the currently observed values abruptly a few tens of myr ago . a possible reason for the lack of sf in the past could be that the pre - collisional gas disk was well below criticality and the density enhancements caused by the passing wave were not sufficient to drive the densities above the critical value required for collapse .",
    "even if the disk was critical before the interaction , the passing wave can heat the disk , making it subcritical .",
    "hence realistic ring models should include heating and cooling of the disk .",
    "observations of more ring galaxies in the rc would be invaluable in working out the details of the physics of sf in an expanding density wave .",
