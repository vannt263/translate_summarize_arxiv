    "pixelized photon detector ( ppd ) , a generic name of multi - pixel geiger - mode avalanche photodiodes , is a high - sensitivity photon detector developed recently .",
    "this device has attracted much attention since a ppd has great advantages over photo - multipliers , such as insensitivity to magnetic fields , compactness , low bias voltage and low power consumption , although the active area of the device is limited to be @xmath5 mm@xmath1 at present .",
    "therefore a ppd device is very useful for high - energy and astrophysics experiments and medical science applications , especially for a readout device with scintillating fibers , wave length shifting fibers , and fine granulated scintillating crystals , etc .",
    "a review about ppd has been prepared by d.  renker  @xcite , for example .",
    "the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is one of such ppd devices which has been developed by hamamatsu photonics  @xcite .",
    "three types of mppcs ( 100 , 400 , and 1600-pixels type ) with an active area of 1@xmath61 mm@xmath1 , and some other larger devices , are commercially available at present .",
    "experimental groups , such as t2k , ilc , belle , trek and koto , are planning to adopt the mppc in their detector systems for scintillating fibers and/or wavelength - shifting fibers readout , and for ring imaging cherenkov detectors  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of the basic performance of the mppc have been carried out by those groups ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    for practical use of the mppc ,",
    "radiation hardness is one of the important issues to be made clear for applications in a high radiation environment . in general",
    ", an indication of radiation damage on silicon devices is an increase of the leakage current , which is caused by lattice defects created due to radiation damage .",
    "an experimental study with a positron beam has been reported for radiation hardness of old types of mppcs , showing an increase of the leakage current and the dark - count rates but no significant change in the gain and the photon - detection efficiency  @xcite . for @xmath7-ray irradiation ,",
    "high dark pulses generated at the outer regions of individual pixels have been observed after 240 gy irradiation in addition to increases of the leakage current and the noise rates  @xcite . to investigate hadron - induced radiation damage , which is important in high - energy physics experiments",
    ", we performed an irradiation experiment with a 53.3 mev proton beam .    in the following part of this report ,",
    "at first , we describe the setup and the procedure for the irradiation experiment .",
    "then , characteristic changes , such as the leakage current , gains , dark counts , pulse - height distributions , are presented .",
    "finally , we discuss issues to be concerned with the effects caused by proton - induced radiation damage from a practical standpoint .",
    "two pieces of mppc samples , hamamatsu s10362 - 11 - 050c delivered in february 2007 , were irradiated with a proton beam in the experiment .",

    "[ fig : substrate ] .",
    "protons were directed onto the sample from the direction perpendicular to the entrance face of the sample . to avoid radio - activation of materials other than mppc caused by proton irradiation ,",
    "a 20@xmath625  mm@xmath1 hole was made in the substrate .",
    "a blue led ( nichia nspb320bs , @xmath17  nm ) on the substrate was used as a light source for measurements of pulse - height distributions .",
    "a voltage source , keithley model 2400 , was employed in order to apply a negative reverse voltage to the mppc sample .",
    "the leakage current of the sample was measured with the voltage source and recorded by the laptop computer connected to the voltage source via gp - ib communications .",
    "signals from the mppc sample were sent to a readout circuit , consisting of nim and camac modules , to measure pulse - height spectra and dark - noise rates .",
    "the resistors and capacitors on the substrate were used as noise - filter circuits .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the research center for nuclear physics , osaka university by using the 53.3  mev proton beam from the avf cyclotron .",
    "protons were extracted from a vacuum beam pipe of the h - course beamline through a thin aluminum window to the experimental area .",
    "the beam size was set to be a rectangular shape of 6@xmath68  mm@xmath1 by adjusting the several beamline slits , which was enough to cover the active area of mppc , 1@xmath61  mm@xmath1 .",
    "the beam current was first tuned to be 2  na at the beam stopper placed downstream of the final slit . then the beam intensity was further reduced and controlled by inserting several mesh - type attenuators in the beamline located between the ion source and avf cyclotron , so that the proper proton beam flux was obtained for the irradiation experiment ( 10@xmath18 - 10@xmath10  p / mm / s ) .",
    "the uniformity of the beam intensity near the beam center was measured with a copper collimator and plastic scintillators . from this measurement",
    ", we confirmed that the position dependence of the beam intensity varied by less than 5% in the region of 4@xmath64  mm@xmath1 around the beam center .",
    "[ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup for this proton irradiation .",
    "a mppc sample mounted on the substrate was placed just after the vacuum window of the beam pipe .",
    "the sample was covered with a black sheet ( 200  @xmath9 m thickness ) for light shielding .",
    "we set a platinum thermometer near the mppc sample in order to monitor variations of the temperature inside of the black sheet during the experiment .",
    "the proton beam emerging from the beam pipe passed through the mppc sample , and then it was trimmed with a copper collimator to be 3.5  mm@xmath19 .",
    "two plastic scintillators placed downstream of the collimator were used to monitor the number of protons contained in the collimated beam .",
    "the proton beam was dumped in the beam stopper placed at the end of the beamline .",
    "the intensity of the beam impinging on the active area of the mppc sample was estimated from the total counts of the coincidence signals of the plastic scintillators and the measurement times .",
    "since the beam intensity was almost flat in the region of 4@xmath64  mm@xmath1 around the beam center , we obtained the intensity from the coincidence rate by taking the ratio between the active area of the mppc sample and the area of the collimator hole , @xmath20 , into account , where we assumed the machining accuracy of the collimator hole to be 50  @xmath9 m .",
    "the following corrections were also taken into account : beam loss due to the scattering at the ceramic package of the mppc sample and the black sheet ( @xmath21 ) , and the beam divergence induced difference of the beam density at the sample position and at the collimator position ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath21 was obtained by the coincidence rate change between with and without the mppc sample wrapped by the black sheet .",
    "@xmath22 was also determined by comparing the coincidence rates at different collimator positions .",
    "we estimated @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be 2.71 and 1.18 , respectively .",
    "the considered uncertainties of the product of @xmath23 are the coincidence rate fluctuation during the irradiation ( 3.4  % ) and accuracy of the detector and collimator positioning ( 0.9  % ) . as the result",
    ", we obtained the correction factor , @xmath24 , to multiply to the coincidence rates .",
    "the proton beam - flux during irradiation was monitored in this way .    a readout circuit consisting of nim and camac modules was prepared for the measurements of pulse - height distributions and dark - noise rates of the mppcs as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] .",
    "the blue led was driven with ttl signals coming from a 100  hz clock generator .",
    "signals from the mppc sample were sent to an amplifier ( phillips model 777 ) where the gain was set to be 56.4 .",
    "then , these signals were integrated with a 12-bit charge - sensitive adc of a camac module ( repic rpc-022 ) . gate signals from the clock generator were input to the adc module .",
    "the gate width , 55  ns , was determined so that entire pulse signals coming from the mppc were integrated , where the typical fall time of the signals was 40  ns .",
    "the intensity of the led light was adjusted in such a way that the average number of photo - electrons ( @xmath9 ) was about 1.3 .",
    "this value can be calculated from the null probability of the poisson statistics @xmath25 @xmath26 ) , which was obtained from the ratio of the number of pedestal events to the total events in an adc distribution .",
    "a discriminator ( phillips model 705 ) and a visual scaler ( kaizu works kn1860 ) were used for the measurement of dark - noise rates .",
    "sample  # 1 +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      first , we checked basic performance of the mppc samples , such as gain , current - voltage ( @xmath27-@xmath28 ) curve and noise rate , before the proton irradiation .",
    "this performance is to be compared with that after the irradiation . for the next step ,",
    "one of the mppc samples with normal operating voltage was irradiated with the proton beam .",
    "after the irradiation , in order to check recovery effects on radiation damage , the leakage current was monitored for about 1 hour under the condition without the beam .",
    "then we measured the basic performances after the irradiation .",
    "this process was repeated several times .",
    "we used two different beam intensities for the irradiation .",
    "one of the mppc samples , sample  # 1 , was irradiated with a proton beam flux ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath30  p / mm@xmath1/s .",
    "the second mppc , sample  # 2 , was irradiated with a lower flux , @xmath31  p / mm@xmath1/s .",
    "one irradiation took 10 minutes for both the samples . for sample  # 1",
    ", we repeated the proton irradiation twice , thereby estimated the proton fluence ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath33  p / mm@xmath1 in total . on the other hand ,",
    "three times irradiation were made for sample  # 2 , thus the total fluence is @xmath34  p / mm@xmath1 .",
    "the beam flux and total fluence in each irradiation are summarized in table [ tab : flux ] .    instead of the proton fluence @xmath32",
    ", it may be useful to represent a total fluence with 1 mev neutron equivalent fluence ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this quantity is commonly used in order to evaluate damage levels caused by different radiation sources and different energies based on the niel scaling hypothesis , which is the assumption that damage level in silicon bulk is related to the cross - section of processes with non - ionization energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 can be obtained with a hardness factor @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where the value of the @xmath35 for 53.3 mev protons is about 1.7 obtained from the displacement damage function described in the reference  @xcite .",
    "hence , we estimated the @xmath2 for sample  # 1 to be @xmath37  n / mm@xmath1 , and @xmath38  n / mm@xmath1 for sample  # 2 , respectively .    the absorption dose ( @xmath39 ) due to the proton irradiation can be estimated from the proton fluence @xmath32 by taking the mass stopping power of 53.3  mev protons in silicon , @xmath40 mev@xmath41cm@xmath1/g , into account .",
    "the estimated dose rates for both sample  # 1 and sample  # 2 were 130  gy / h and 16  gy / h , respectively .",
    "thus , the total radiation dose was 42  gy for sample  # 1 , and 8.0  gy for sample  # 2 .",
    "the temperature in the experimental area was controlled to be stable . during the experiment the temperature near the mppc samples ( @xmath43 ) was in the range 27.0 - 28.0  @xmath11c .",
    "note that we estimated the maximum temperature increment caused by the proton beam in the mppc volume to be 0.03  @xmath11c in the case of 10 minutes irradiation , which was calculated from the beam energy deposition in the mppc and the specific heats of the device materials .",
    "thus , we concluded that the temperature increase due to the irradiation was negligible compared with the temperature fluctuation in the experimental area .",
    "the temperatures in each measurement are also summarized in table [ tab : flux ] .",
    "[ fig : it](a ) shows the variations of the leakage current of sample  # 1 during the experiment .",
    "the measurement of the leakage current was started 10 minutes before the first irradiation , where the leakage current was about @xmath44  @xmath9a at the operating voltage .",
    "we irradiated the sample with the proton beam for 10 minutes ( see the leftmost hatched region in the figure ) . during the first irradiation , the current almost linearly",
    "increased with time due to radiation damage .",
    "step - like changes at the beginning and ending of the irradiation , @xmath451.0  @xmath9a , would be caused by free carriers generated due to the ionizing processes of the beam protons traversing in silicon .",
    "after the beam stops , the leakage current gradually decreased with time .",
    "this indicates recovery phenomenon from the radiation damage , although the recovery was not completed to the original condition within hours .",
    "the second irradiation was performed after the measurements of pulse - height distributions , @xmath27-@xmath28 curves and dark noise .",
    "again the leakage current increased linearly with time , and a similar recovery effect is also seen in the second irradiation .",
    "note that we applied the fixed operating voltage with the voltage source during the measurement ; thus , the increase of the leakage current due to the radiation damage caused a gain reduction due to a voltage drop at the resistors @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the filter circuit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : substrate ] ) .",
    "such effect should be corrected for performance studies and this will be discussed later .",
    "the result of leakage - current variations for sample  # 2 , which was irradiated with a lower beam flux , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : it](b ) .",
    "although the increasing rate during the irradiation was low compared to that for the sample  # 1 irradiation because of the lower beam flux , we have found a similar tendency as in the sample  # 1 irradiation , that is , the linear increase of the leakage current and the recovery effect .",
    "the offset of the leakage current due to the ionizing processes of protons in silicon was about 0.3  @xmath9a in this case .",
    "as we mentioned , the effect of the voltage drop at the resistors @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be corrected .",
    "since the leakage current ( @xmath48 ) flows the resistors arranged in series , the voltage drop is expressed as @xmath49 .",

    "the leakage currents have rapidly increased with reverse voltages after the irradiation in comparison with that before the irradiation .",
    "this tendency is more significant for higher doses .",
    "next we discuss the effects on photon - counting capability , which is one of the features of mppcs .",
    "the pulse - height distributions of the irradiated samples were measured by flushing the blue led .",
    "[ fig : adc_dist ] shows the distributions for different irradiated doses . before the irradiation",
    "the distributions for both samples show the structure with clear discrete peaks , which includes a pedestal peak , a single photon peak and so on , and those peaks are well separated each other .",
    "in contrast , the situation changes after the irradiation .",
    "first , the position of the pedestal peak shifts slightly toward lower channels because of the baseline shift coming from high dark counting rates .",
    "note that the dark counting rate of mppc increases after the irradiation , which is the main reason for the increase of the leakage current .",
    "this is because production of the lattice defects due to radiation damage gives higher probability of thermal carrier generation and delayed pulse coming from trapped carriers in the defects ( afterpulsing ) .",
    "actually , the measurement of the counting rates without the led showed that the counting rates drastically increased from 270  khz to 6.8  mhz after the 2.8  gy irradiation ( although we could not measure the counting rates for higher doses due to limitation of the scaler performance , the counting rates would be expected to be more than 10  mhz ) .",
    "another thing is that the distributions are contaminated with accidental backgrounds coming from dark noise and afterpulsing as the dose increases .",
    "this effect smears the separation of the peaks in the pulse - height distributions as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : adc_dist ] since some of noise pulses are not integrated over the entire charge .",
    "gain uniformity among the individual apd pixels may also be deteriorated by radiation damage because if the extent of the damage differs among the pixels , average leakage current through each quenching resistor varies .",
    "this results in gain variations among the pixels because of the different voltage drops at the quenching resistors , and thus the peaks could be broadened . for these reasons ,",
    "the peak structure has completely disappeared for the distributions of more than 21  gy in the case of 55  ns gate width .",
    "this means that the capability of the photon - counting by measuring pulse - height spectra was lost due to the radiation damage .",
    "the gain variations were evaluated before and after the irradiation .",
    "we define the gain of the mppcs as the ratio of the collected charge ( @xmath59 ) and the electron charge ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 .",
    "the reason is that a single carrier generated by an incident photon is multiplied due to geiger discharge , and then the collected charge in a single pixel is extracted as a output signal . in the data analysis the charge @xmath59 was estimated from the gain of the amplifier , 56.4 , and the charge corresponding to single - photon signals .",
    "the charge of single - photon signals was obtained by the fit to the pulse - height distributions with a multi - gaussian function .",
    "[ fig : gain - v ] shows the gains as a function of reverse voltages for different radiation doses .",
    "note that only the gains for sample  # 2 was obtained since we observed no peak structure in the distributions of sample  # 1 after the irradiation .",
    "the gain before the irradiation shows a linear dependence with the reverse voltage ( @xmath28 ) since the gain of a single pixel ( @xmath62 ) increases with @xmath28 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the average capacitance of a single pixel , and @xmath56 is the breakdown voltage .",

    "the distributions show a gaussian shape having the mean values of about 1760 channels , where the repeatability of the mean - value measurement was evaluated to be about 2% .",

    "thus , the difference of the relative width would be not due to the variability of individual devices , but given due to the radiation damage .",
    "some details about the pulse - height resolution will be discussed later .",
    "the leakage current of the mppc increased with total irradiated dose as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - flux ] . this behavior can be interpreted as an increase of thermal excitations of carriers via intermediate states in the forbidden gap created due to radiation damage .",
    "such effect is known to be categorized into bulk damage and surface damage , where the bulk damage is caused by defects in the si bulk and the surface damage is created at the si - sio@xmath15 interface . in the case of proton irradiation , both of them can contribute to the increase of the leakage current . in order to understand the mechanism of proton - induced damage",
    ", studies of neutron irradiation would be helpful since the surface damage does not contribute to neutron - induced radiation damage  @xcite .",
    "photon - counting capability , which is one of the features of mppcs , was gradually deteriorated with the irradiation dose and completely lost after 21  gy irradiation due to baseline fluctuations and noise pileup as a result of increasing dark counting rates .",
    "this effect would be problematic for some applications in high - energy physics experiments .",
    "for example , when one uses the mppc as a photon - counting device for a ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) , which detects weak light generated from aerogel radiators , the reconstruction of ring images becomes more difficult due to the increase of fake hits .",
    "this point should be carefully considered . on the other hand , for the detectors which is expected to yield more light ( @xmath72 photo - electrons ) , such as scintillators with wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fiber readout , the damage effect might be acceptable at least up to 8.0  gy because no significant change was observed in the gain and the pulse - height distribution .",
    "we have found an indication of the deterioration of the pulse - height resolution for the sample irradiated with 42  gy .",
    "although we have not understood the mechanism of the deterioration , there are two possible explanations : ( 1 ) change of gain uniformity among the individual pixels and ( 2 ) increase of afterpulsing .",
    "the afterpulsing effect would be expected to increase after the irradiation because of radiation damage .",
    "hence , increase of afterpulsing could affect to the pulse height distributions .",
    "the deterioration of the pulse - height resolution is an issue to be concerned in the case of energy - measurement applications .",
