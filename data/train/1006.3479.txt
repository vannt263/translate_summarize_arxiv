    "chaotic attractors typically possess a dense set of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) .",
    "this form of phase space skeleton was exploited in a control scheme developed by ott , grebogi and yorke  @xcite in the 1990s .",
    "their approach provided a method for stabilizing targeted upos of chaotic systems for application in both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments .",
    "this method spawned the development of a number of related and alternative control schemes , with similar goals , which can be utilized in systems for which strictly periodic behavior is attractive  @xcite .",
    "one of these schemes , which has been especially well investigated and tested , was proposed by pyragas  @xcite .",
    "pyragas control exploits the symmetry of a periodic orbit in a natural way by providing , in its simplest realization , additive feedback in the form @xmath1 . \\nonumber\\ ] ] here @xmath2 is the state vector of the dynamical system at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the period of the targeted upo , and @xmath5 is a constant @xmath6 feedback gain matrix .",
    "the scheme is manifestly noninvasive , since the feedback vanishes when the system reaches the @xmath4-periodic target state . setting aside the difficult questions related to basins of attraction , there are then just two key ingredients to the successful implementation of this approach : the period @xmath4 of the targeted upo is needed , and the feedback gain matrix @xmath5 needs to guarantee stabilization . only to the extent that an appropriate choice of @xmath5 is required",
    "does the method rely on detailed knowledge , beyond the period , of the structure of the upo in phase space . for a review of the extensive literature on applications of pyragas feedback , including successful experimental implementations , see  @xcite .",
    "this paper is motivated by the question of how to choose the feedback gain @xmath5 in pyragas control to ensure that it will be effective .",
    "we focus on a simple , generic mechanism for the creation of an unstable periodic orbit : the subcritical hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium",
    ". other generic mechanisms for creating upos in dynamical systems include homoclinic bifurcations , saddle - node ( or fold ) bifurcations of limit cycles , saddle - node bifurcations of fixed points on an invariant circle , and period - doubling bifurcations  @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of successful demonstrations of pyragas control of periodic orbits destabilized through a period - doubling bifurcation ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "postlethwaite  @xcite has shown that pyragas - type feedback can stabilize a upo arising from a subcritical bifurcation from a robust heteroclinic cycle in a three - dimensional system of equivariant ordinary differential equations .",
    "interestingly , pyragas feedback works in this case even though the period of the targeted orbit , and hence the time - delay , diverges as the heteroclinic bifurcation point is approached .",
    "fiedler  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated an example of pyragas control that stabilizes a circular limit cycle ( _ i.e. _ a  rotating wave \" ) near a fold bifurcation in a planar system of ordinary differential equations with @xmath7-symmetry , and successfully applied this to a higher - dimensional model taken from nonlinear optics that possesses a similar rotational symmetry .",
    "the first example that demonstrated the successful stabilization of a upo arising from a subcritical hopf bifurcation was given in  @xcite , and further analyzed in  @xcite , with an experimental implementation described in  @xcite .",
    "in these papers , the authors added pyragas feedback directly to the hopf normal form : @xmath8 .",
    "\\label{eq : normalform}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the period of the upo , and the complex number @xmath10 plays the role of the feedback gain matrix @xmath5 .",
    "a beauty of this simple example is that it represents a rare instance in which solutions of a nonlinear delay differential equation can be computed analytically in closed form , and their bifurcations can be studied with comparable finesse .",
    "specifically , using methods of bifurcation theory , the authors were able to understand the mechanism for stabilization in this example .",
    "for instance , they showed that the feedback control leads to additional delay - induced hopf bifurcations of the equilibrium @xmath11 , and consequently it is possible to change the equilibrium s stability so that the original _ subcritical _ hopf bifurcation to the upo turns into a _ supercritical _",
    "bifurcation to a stable periodic orbit .",
    "an important contribution of the fiedler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite paper was that it also provided a counterexample to a published claim  @xcite that pyragas control is impossible when the upo has an odd number of real positive floquet multipliers greater than one .",
    "in the ten years between the published claims of the odd number limitation  @xcite and the first counterexample to it  @xcite , a number of modifications of the pyragas control scheme were developed .",
    "one of these , based on introducing an additional unstable direction via the controller , was proposed in order to stabilize upos created by a subcritical hopf bifurcation  @xcite , including an example applied to the lorenz equations  @xcite .",
    "recently an analysis of the lorenz equations with the standard pyragas feedback provided a second example of stabilization of a upo resulting from a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "specifically , postlethwaite and silber  @xcite demonstrated that the stabilization mechanism identified by fiedler _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite can also apply to upos in higher - dimensional systems , provided that the feedback gain matrix is chosen correctly .",
    "the strategy they outlined is to add feedback of the type investigated in  @xcite in the directions tangent to the center manifold of the uncontrolled lorenz system .",
    "stabilization of the upos is then possible over a broad range of control parameter values .",
    "the reduction of higher - dimensional systems to the two - dimensional normal form near a hopf bifurcation is a standard procedure  @xcite . likewise ,",
    "such systems with additive pyragas feedback , now infinite - dimensional , can also be reduced to the standard two - dimensional normal form in the vicinity of a hopf bifurcation , where the parameters of the feedback gain matrix modify the coefficients in the normal form . in the fiedler example",
    "@xcite , the feedback terms are added directly to the hopf normal form , but a surprising result of  @xcite was that the same sequence of bifurcations identified in the simpler normal form example also appears in this higher - dimensional example .",
    "this result is generalized further in the current paper .",
    "a further motivation for the work we present in this paper is to understand the origin of a particular degenerate hopf bifurcation problem that acts as the organizing center in both the simple normal form example   and the lorenz example .",
    "specifically , we generalize the results of  @xcite by studying an @xmath0-dimensional system of equations containing a subcritical hopf bifurcation of a stable equilibrium . as in the lorenz example",
    ", the gain matrix @xmath5 for this system is such that the pyragas feedback only acts in the directions tangent to center manifold of the uncontrolled system near the hopf bifurcation point , and in this tangent plane the gain collapses to a @xmath12 matrix that is proportional to a rotation matrix .",
    "thus , we consider a family of gain matrices @xmath5 that are parameterized by a magnitude @xmath13 and a phase @xmath14 ( _ cf .",
    "_   written in terms of real variables ) .    the additive pyragas feedback results in a delay differential equation",
    "we use methods of bifurcation theory to show that pyragas control can stabilize the small - amplitude upo in a neighborhood of its bifurcation provided @xmath15 and @xmath14 are chosen appropriately .",
    "specifically , our analysis applies in a neighborhood of a threshold value for @xmath15 , which depends on the phase angle @xmath14 , which must lie in a particular interval that we determine .",
    "the interval depends only on the cubic coefficient of the hopf normal form for the uncontrolled problem .",
    "in particular , we find that this interval for @xmath14 always exists provided that the imaginary part of the cubic coefficient of this normal form is nonzero .",
    "the threshold value for @xmath13 is associated with a highly degenerate hopf bifurcation of the zero solution of the delay differential equation .",
    "specifically , for this gain modulus , the critical eigenvalue of the linearized problem does not cross the imaginary axis as the bifurcation parameter is varied so the  nonzero - speed \" eigenvalue crossing condition for a generic hopf bifurcation is violated .",
    "moreover , a center manifold reduction of the delay differential equation to hopf normal form reveals that the cubic coefficient is purely imaginary for this threshold value of @xmath13 , necessitating that one go to higher order than cubic in any analysis of the bifurcating periodic orbits .",
    "the analysis of this degenerate bifurcation problem provides the basis for our claims that pyragas control can stabilize upos that are born from a generic subcritical bifurcation of a stable equilibrium in the uncontrolled problem .",
    "it also explains why the same sequence of bifurcations occur in the normal form example   as in the lorenz example analyzed in  @xcite .",

    "one is the original hopf bifurcation to the pyragas orbit , which occurs at @xmath29 for every value of @xmath13 .",

    "a curve of transcritical bifurcations also emanates from this point , which acts as the organizing center for the bifurcation structure of the problem .",

    "however , the delay terms can change the stability of the trivial equilibrium . for @xmath34 ,",
    "we find that the stability of the trivial equilibrium switches to being _ unstable _ for @xmath23 and _ stable _ for @xmath33 ( in a neighborhood of @xmath24 , @xmath35 ) . since both the location of the hopf bifurcation at @xmath24 , and the location of the pyragas orbits ( in @xmath23 ) are independent of @xmath13",
    ", then the hopf bifurcation must change criticality from subcritical to supercritical .",

    "specifically , we followed  @xcite and considered feedback only in the directions that are tangent to the center manifold at the bifurcation point .",
    "as in  @xcite , the feedback gain matrix is parameterized by a gain amplitude , @xmath13 , and a phase angle , @xmath14 .",

    "we performed a center manifold reduction of the governing delay differential equations to prove this result in section  [ sec : cmreduction ] .",
    "the reason this degeneracy may be surprising is that only _ two _ parameters ( @xmath45 and @xmath13 ) are varied , and yet a codimension - three problem is obtained . in section  [ sec : delayprob ] we demonstrated that this is due to the fact that the time - delay of the pyragas feedback is fixed to coincide with the period of the original upo .",
    "a consequence of this restriction is that the existence properties for the bifurcating branch of targeted periodic orbits is unaffected by the feedback , although its stability is altered .",

    "they analyze a series of bifurcations in the three - parameter space @xmath4-@xmath45-@xmath13 ( in our notation ) .",
    "since they allow @xmath4 to vary , the point @xmath24 , @xmath295 , @xmath130 in their case is a codimension - three point , and there is a complicated sequence of bifurcations about this point .    the fundamental mechanism at work for the pyragas control of upos arising from a subcritical hopf bifurcation was first explained in the paper of fiedler , _ et al . _",
    "they showed that the feedback introduces delay - induced instabilities of the bifurcating equilibrium , thereby altering its stability properties in a neighborhood of the original hopf bifurcation . in this way",
    ", the equilibrium can change from being stable for @xmath23 to being stable for @xmath33 , and then the original subcritical hopf bifurcation ( with increasing @xmath45 ) can be converted to a supercritical hopf bifurcation ( with decreasing @xmath45 ) .",
    "this understanding suggests a number of interesting directions for generalizing pyragas feedback for other bifurcations , where a similar simple control mechanism may work .",
    "the hopf bifurcation is just one of several bifurcation mechanisms by which upos can generically arise in dynamical systems .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , two other generic mechanisms for creating upos in dynamical systems include homoclinic ( or heteroclinic ) global bifurcations and saddle - node bifurcations of limit cycles .",
    "the application of pyragas - type feedback to stabilize upos arising in some of these situations has already been studied in the context of specific examples  @xcite , and in both the saddle - node and heteroclinic case , the upo is stabilized in a steady - state bifurcation with a delay - induced periodic orbit . in the heteroclinic case ,",
    "the original problem was again of a higher dimension than the upo .",
    "the gain matrix was chosen as in this paper , to be tangent to the two - dimensional manifold containing the upo .",
    "we emphasise that this approach , studying the generic bifurcations which generate upos , leads to results which allow one to choose a gain matrix and predict the parameter region for which control can be achieved , with very little knowledge of the structure of the upo .",
    "preliminary calculations attempting to stabilize a upo arising from a generic homoclinic bifurcation have indicated that this is in fact _ not _ possible , in distinct contrast to the other cases  @xcite .    an additional promising direction for generalizing pyragas feedback for control of upos",
    "is to hopf bifurcation problems with symmetry .",
    "a feature of such bifurcations , which arise naturally in pattern forming systems  @xcite , is that they typically involve multiple complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis simultaneously .",
    "thus the results of this paper do not apply directly since we assumed that a _",
    "simple _ complex conjugate pair crosses the imaginary axis at @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , in equivariant hopf bifurcation problems , a number of periodic orbits , distinguishable by their group of symmetry properties , may bifurcate simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "this group theoretic classification result suggests investigating feedback controls , analogous to pyragas , that exploit the targeted symmetry properties ( which may be spatial , temporal , or a combination of spatio - temporal symmetries ) in such a way that the feedback vanishes on the targeted state only",
    ". the goal would be to use the feedback control to change stability properties of the bifurcating equilbrium , while naturally preserving the bifurcation to the targeted state . some first steps in this direction of controlling patterns arising in a hopf bifurcation , using extensions of pyragas control tailored to spatial symmetries ( as well as temporal ones ) ,",
