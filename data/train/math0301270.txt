    "a periodic two - dimensional lorentz gas ( sinai billiard ) is a billiard system on the two - dimensional torus with one or more circular regions ( scatterers ) removed .",
    "this model in classical mechanics was introduced by lorentz @xcite in 1905 to describe the dynamics of electrons in metals .",
    "the associated dynamical system is simple enough to allow a comprehensive study , yet complex enough to exhibit chaos . according to gutzwiller @xcite : `` the original billiard of sinai was designed to imitate , in the most simple - minded manner , a gas of hard spherical balls which bounce around inside a finite enclosure .",
    "the formidable technical difficulties of this fundamental problem were boiled down to the shape of a square for the enclosure , and the collisions between the balls were reduced to a single point particle hitting a circular hard wall at the center of the enclosure . ''",
    "the model was intensively studied from the point of view of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "our primary goal here is to estimate the _ free - path length _",
    "( _ first return time _ ) in this periodic two - dimensional model in the small - scatterer limit .",
    "we solve the following three open problems :    * the existence and computation of the distribution of the free path length , previously considered in @xcite . *",
    "the existence and computation of the distribution of the geometric free path length , previously shown , but not fully proved , in @xcite . * the existence and computation of the second ( constant ) term in the asymptotic formula of the ks entropy @xmath2 of the billiard map in this model , previously studied in @xcite .    for each @xmath3 let @xmath4 denote by @xmath5 the boundary @xmath6 of @xmath7 , and define the _ free path length _",
    "( also called _ first exit time _ ) as the borel map given by @xmath8 if @xmath9 is irrational , then @xmath10 for every @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the probability space @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the characteristic function of @xmath17 .",
    "for every @xmath18 the probability that @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 lower and upper bounds for @xmath21 of correct order of magnitude were established by bourgain , golse and wennberg @xcite , using the rational channels introduced by bleher @xcite .",
    "more recently , caglioti and golse @xcite have proved the existence of the cesaro @xmath22 and @xmath23 means , proving for large @xmath24 that @xmath25    in sections 2 - 7 below we prove the existence of the limit @xmath26 of @xmath27 as @xmath28 and explicitly compute it .",

    "the related  homogeneous \" problem when the trajectory starts at the origin @xmath34 and the phase space is a subinterval of the velocity range @xmath35 was studied by gologan and the authors .",
    "the limit distribution @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the lebesgue measure , was shown to exist and explicitly computed in @xcite .",
    "unlike @xmath38 , the function @xmath39 is compactly supported on the interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "interestingly , in the particular situation where the scatterers are vertical segments , this case is related to some old problems in diophantine approximation investigated by erd \" os , sz \" usz and tur ' an @xcite , friedman and niven @xcite , and by kesten @xcite .    the main tools used to prove theorem [ t1.1 ] are a certain three - strip partition of @xmath41 and the weil - sali ' e estimate for kloosterman sums @xcite .",
    "the latter is used in infinitesimal form with respect to the parameter @xmath42 to count the number of solutions of equations of form @xmath43 in various regions in @xmath44 .",
    "this approach , somehow reminiscent of the circle method , produces good estimates , allowing us to keep under control the error terms .",
    "it was developed and used recently in many situations to study problems related to the spacing statistics of farey fractions and lattice points in @xmath44 @xcite . a possible source for getting better estimates for the error terms might come from further cancellations in certain sums of kloosterman sums , of the form @xcite @xmath45",
    "the three - strip partition of @xmath46 is related to the continued fraction decomposition of the slope of the trajectory . following work of blank and krikorian @xcite on the longest orbit of the billiard ,",
    "caglioti and golse explicitly introduced this partition and used it in conjunction with ergodic properties of the gauss map @xcite to prove .",
    "we will use it in section 3 in a suitable setting for our computations .",
    "one can also consider the phase space @xmath47 with @xmath48 the inward unit normal at @xmath49 and the probability measure @xmath50 on @xmath51 obtained by normalizing the liouville measure @xmath52 to mass one .",
    "consider also the distribution @xmath53 of the _ geometric free path length _ @xmath54 .",
    "the first moment ( _ geometric mean free path length _ ) of @xmath55 with respect to @xmath50 can be expressed as @xmath56 equality is a consequence of a more general formula of santal ' o @xcite who extended earlier work of p ' olya on the mean visible distance in a forrest @xcite . the formulation from appears in @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the mean free path does not give however any information on other moments or on the limiting distribution of the free path in the small - scatterer limit .",
