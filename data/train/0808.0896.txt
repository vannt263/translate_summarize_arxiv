    "it is widely accepted by some time that merging and interaction events play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "mergers change the mass function of galaxies , creating a progression from small galaxies to larger ones ; the merging process can also change the morphology of the constituents , transforming gas - rich spirals in quiescent ellipticals .",
    "interactions can also trigger a wide set of physical and morphological phenomena , such as tidal tails , bridges and shells , kinematically decoupled cores and star formation enhancements ( see review of @xcite ) .",
    "interacting galaxies also show enhanced star formation when compared with isolated galaxies .",
    "such enhancement was initially proposed by @xcite to explain the wider range of optical colors found in galaxies in pairs . since then , numerous studies have confirmed these results , especially in the central regions , through measurements of optical emission lines @xcite , infrared emission @xcite and radio emission @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also shown that this enhancement is a function of the projected galaxy pair separation ( e.g. @xcite ) , being stronger in low - mass than in high - mass galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the star formation rate as measured by the h@xmath2 equivalent width for galaxies in pairs selected from the sloan digital sky survey , is some 70% higher when compared to a control sample of galaxies with equal stellar mass distribution .",
    "there is a connection between the interaction strength and the morphological distortion in binary galaxies . according to @xcite models , the response of the gas to a close passage depends dramatically on the mass distribution of the galaxy , with the irregularities in the gas velocity field tracing the disturbances in the gravitational potential of the galaxy as observed , for example , in some galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "combined n - body / hydrodynamic simulations show that galaxy - galaxy mergers disturb the gas velocity field significantly , and hence lead to asymmetries and distortions in the rotation curves @xcite .",
    "however , according to these authors , no severe distortions are observable about 1 gyr after the first encounter .",
    "the gas motions created by the interaction can also significantly alter the chemical state of the galaxies @xcite , and modify the usually smooth radial metallicity gradient often found in isolated disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that o / h abundance in the central region of nearby galaxy pairs is systematically lower that that of isolated objects .",
    "these authors suggest that the lower metallicity is a consequence of gas infall caused by the interaction , but very few observational studies have been published analysing in detail the influence of different levels of interactions in the metallicity distribution and enrichment properties of galaxies .",
    "ferreiro & pastoriza 2004 ( hereafter fp04 ) , in a study of the integrated photometry and star formation activity in a sample of interacting systems from the arp - madore catalogue @xcite , found that the galaxies involved have bluer colours than those of isolated galaxies of the same morphological type , indicating an enhancement of star forming activity .",
    "this enhancement was also previously suggested by @xcite to explain the slightly larger values of h@xmath3n@xmath4ii equivalent widths found in these systems , when compared with normal isolated spiral galaxies . from their sample",
    ", we have selected several systems to start a more comprehensive study of the effects of the interactions in the kinematics , stellar population and abundances of the galaxies in the so - called `` minor merger '' systems , defined here as physical pairs with mass ratio in the range of @xmath5 .",
    "this paper presents the results for the system am2306 - 721 .",
    "this pair is composed by a peculiar spiral with disturbed arms ( hereafter , am2306a ) in interaction with an irregular galaxy ( hereafter , am2306b ) .",
    "both galaxies contain very luminous h@xmath4ii regions with h@xmath2 luminosity in the range of @xmath6l(h@xmath7erg s@xmath0 as estimated from h@xmath8 images @xcite ; and high star formation rate in the range of 0.07 to 10 @xmath9/yr @xcite .",

    "spectra in the range 3350 to 7130  were taken in two settings with the b600 grating , and the 1@xmath10 slit , yielding a spectral resolution of 5.5 .",
    "the frames were binned on - chip by 4 and 2 pixels in the spatial and spectra directions , respectively , resulting in a spatial scale of 0.288 @xmath10pxl@xmath0 , and 0.9pxl@xmath0 dispersion .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the maximum radius to which we can observe the gas in emission is quite certainly smaller than the total radius of the galaxies , so our estimates of the dynamical mass give a lower limit to the actual dynamical mass of each system .    in determining the dynamical mass ,",
    "the main source of error is in the estimation of the deprojected velocity , which in turn is highly dependent on the assumed inclination of the galaxies with respect to the plane of the sky .",

    "in order to reconstruct the history of the am2306 - 721 system and to predict the evolution of the encounter , we modeled the interaction between am2306a and am2306b through numerical simulations using the the n - body / sph code gadget-2 developed by @xcite .",

    "this , like most similar cases , is not a fully determined problem , since the observations do not provide all the necessary information to uniquely identify the solution .",
    "therefore , in order to restrict the parameter space when setting up the initial conditions for the simulations , we first calculate orbits that satisfy the constraint given by the observed radial velocity difference , testing different eccentricities , pericenter and line - of - sight direction distances . from that subset , based on the observed morphology , we select a few orbits to run the full simulations , from which the one that best fits the observed properties is selected .",

    "a detailed study of the star formation in minor merger galaxies is an important source of information not only on the age distribution of their stellar population components , but to better understand several aspects related to the interacting process , its effect in the properties of the individual galaxies and their later evolution .",
    "the absorption features arising from the stellar component also affect to different degrees the measured intensity of the emission line in the spectrum of the gaseous component .",
    "this effect is more prominent in , but not restricted to , the balmer lines , so the stellar population contribution must be subtracted from each spectra in order to investigate the physical properties of the gas in these galaxies .    to investigate the star formation history of am2306a and am2306b we use the stellar population synthesis method developed by @xcite .",

    "this library allows us to derive detailed spectral evolution of simple stellar populations across the wavelength range of 3200 to 9500 @xmath66 with a wide range of metallicities .",

    "the adopted number of elements in the base was defined by a compromise between having enough age resolution , having a limited number of features available to constrain the fit , and the desire to mantain a consistent base for all apertures in both galaxies .",

    "<S> we present an observational study about the effects of the interactions in the kinematics , stellar population and abundances of the components of the galaxy pair am2306 - 721 . </S>",
    "<S> rotation curves for the main and companion galaxies were obtained , showing a deprojected velocity amplitude of 175 km s@xmath0 and 185 km s@xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the main and companion galaxies was modeled using numerical n - body / hydrodynamical simulations , with the result indicating that the current stage of the merger would be about 250 myr after perigalacticum . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial variation in the distribution of the stellar population components in both galaxies was analysed by fitting combinations of stellar population models of different age groups . </S>",
    "<S> the central region of main galaxy is dominated by an old ( 5 - 10gyr ) population , while significant contributions from a young ( 200myr ) and intermediate ( 1gyr ) components are found in the disk , being enhanced in the direction of the tidal features . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar population of the companion galaxy is overall much younger , being dominated by components with 1gyr or less , quite widely spread over the whole disk . </S>",
    "<S> spatial profiles of the oxygen abundance were obtained from the a grid of photoionization models using the @xmath1 line ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the disk of the main galaxy shows a clear radial gradient , while the companion galaxy presents an oxygen abundance relatively homogeneous across the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of an abundance gradient in the secondary galaxy is interpreted in terms of mixing by gas flows from the outer parts to the center of the galaxy due to the gravitational interaction with the more massive primary .    </S>",
