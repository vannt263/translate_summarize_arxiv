    "present day , large - scale vlbi surveys have so far focussed on samples of relatively bright ( and often flat spectrum ) radio sources with total flux densities typically @xmath4  mjy . by adopting these selection criteria ,",
    "vlbi surveys have been remarkably successful , but by only targeting the very brightest objects , our current knowledge and general understanding of compact radio sources is surely incomplete .",
    "the technique of phase - referencing now allows sources as faint as 1  mjy per beam to be detected and reliably imaged .",
    "we have recently embarked on a faint source vlbi survey , which employs a novel observing strategy .",
    "we have defined a sample of 127 sources which were drawn from the vla first survey ( becker , r.  h. , white , r.  l. , & helfand , d.  j. 1995 ) and these satisfy the following simple selection criteria , all sources : ( i ) lie within a `` selection box '' @xmath5 wide , centred on the vlbi calibrator j1159 + 291 , ( ii ) have measured first sizes @xmath6  arcsec and , ( iii ) have first peak fluxes @xmath7  mjy / beam .",
    "the advantages of this approach are considerable : ( i ) a relatively unbiased source sample arises naturally , ( ii ) by focusing on one small field scheduling is effortless and observing efficiency maximized ( the long telescope slew times usually associated with snapshot surveys are eliminated ) , ( iii ) measurement of source redshifts ( using multi - fiber optical spectroscopy ) requires only a modest amount of telescope time , ( iv ) by careful selection of a `` model '' calibrator , the data analysis can be largely automated and high snr ( delay , rate and phase ) solutions can be obtained with very short calibrator integration times , ( v ) the offset on the sky between the source and the calibrator is typically much less than @xmath1 , even for relatively large samples , and finally ( vi ) the inverse process of attempting to identify phase - calibrators for every target in a large faint source sample , is happily avoided .",
    "our 127 first sources were observed by merlin at @xmath2  cm in january this year . each source was observed in snapshot , phase - reference mode for a total of 15 minutes spread over 12  hr in hour angle .",
    "the data were analysed automatically with the phase and amplitude corrections of the calibrator ( j1159 + 291 ) being applied to each target source .",
    "the final maps had an r.m.s .",
    "noise of 0.3  mjy / beam and a resolution of 60  mas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . of the 127 sources we observed with merlin ,",
    "68 were clearly detected ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "5 of these were observed to be very extended and are most likely the lobes of extended radio sources which appear as `` doubles '' in the first maps .",
    "the merlin detection rate is impressive , especially when one considers that the @xmath9  cm beam area is a factor of 10000 smaller than first s .",
    "preliminary merlin @xmath10  cm images show that the majority of sources have little intermediate structure ( 0.5  3.0 arcsec ) .",
    "our high detection rate is interesting , the evolutionary models of wall & jackson 1997 predict that the fraction of flat spectrum objects should decrease to 10 - 20% at these flux levels .",
    "( 120,35 ) ( -20,170 )    ( 203,-45 )",
    "for the first time , the combination of the first survey , merlin filter observations and the phase - reference technique , allows us to reliably image and systematically classify a large number of faint , compact radio sources which are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude fainter than those targeted in previous vlbi surveys .",
    "we intend to compare the properties of these faint sources with their brighter cousins . by going",
    "deeper we hope to uncover a few surprises too .",
    "phase - reference merlin - vlbi observations have already begun at @xmath10 cm and further @xmath9 cm vlbi and merlin observations are planned . in the spirit of the first project the merlin @xmath11 and 18  cm images and further information are available on - line at : http://www.nfra.nl/`~`mag/first.html ."
