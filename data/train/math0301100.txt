    "every convex polytope @xmath0 can be described as the convex hull of a finite set @xmath1 of points or as the ( bounded ) set of solutions of a finite system @xmath2 of linear equations and inequalities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lect .  1 ) .",
    "in view of the fundamental role that polytopes play in euclidean geometry and hence for any type of geometric computing , the conversion between the two types of representations , known as the _ convex hull problem _",
    ", is of key interest .",
    "it splits into two separate tasks .",
    "the first task is the _ facet enumeration problem _ : given a finite set of points , determine the combinatorial structure of its boundary . for this one does not want to explicitly enumerate all the faces ( the intersections of @xmath3 with supporting hyperplanes ) , but one wants sparser date , namely to compute a minimal representation of the convex hull @xmath4 in terms of equations and ( facet - defining ) inequalities . here",
    "the equations should describe the affine hull @xmath5 , while the additional inequalities correspond to the _ facets _ ( faces of codimension  @xmath6 ) of  @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is full - dimensional in  @xmath7 , then the facet - defining inequalities are unique up to scaling .",
    "the second task is the _ vertex enumeration problem _ : given a finite system @xmath2 of linear ( equations and ) inequalities , and provided that the set of solutions @xmath8 is bounded , compute the minimal set of points @xmath1 whose convex hull is  @xmath3 .",
    "this minimal set is unique ; it consists of the _ vertices _ ( @xmath9-dimensional faces ) of  @xmath3 .",
    "the two tasks are dual to each other , via cone polarity . thus if an lp - type oracle ( an algorithm which for a system of inequalities computes a solution , or for a set of points computes a separating hyperplane , cf .",
    "@xcite ) is available , every algorithm for the facet enumeration problem can also be used for vertex enumeration , and vice versa .    despite the great interest in the convex hull problem , and despite the fact that a number of different strategies and algorithms have been explored , implemented and analyzed in detail ( see @xcite , as well as avis @xcite @xcite , fukuda @xcite and gawrilow & joswig @xcite @xcite for implementations ) , the problem can be considered `` solved '' neither in theory , nor in practice . if the dimension @xmath10 is fixed , chazelle s celebrated algorithm  @xcite gives an asymptotically worst - case optimal ( polynomial time ) theoretical solution .",
    "its optimality is based on mcmullen s `` upper bound theorem '' @xcite on the maximal number of facets for a @xmath10-polytope with @xmath11 vertices .",
    "however , for any given convex hull problem , the output may be small , but it may also be much larger than the input  indeed , it may be of exponential size , if the dimension is not fixed .",
    "this is very relevant , since high - dimensional computations occur in a variety of important applications .",
    "thus one is asking for a convex hull algorithm whose running time is bounded by a polynomial in the size of `` input plus output '' ?",
    "such an algorithm would be called _ output - sensitive_. the analysis by avis , bremner and seidel  @xcite shows that , unfortunately , none of the known types of convex hull algorithms is output - sensitive .",
    "these can roughly be categorized as follows : incremental and triangulation producing ( e.g. , chazelle s method ) , incremental without triangulations ( e.g. , fourier - motzkin elimination ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lect .  1 ) ) , non - incremental ( e.g. , reverse search  @xcite ) .",
    "note that , by a result of bremner  @xcite , only non - incremental methods can possibly be output - sensitive .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a new ( non - incremental ) convex hull algorithm , based on a completely different principle . to this end",
    ", we first present a ( folklore ) polynomial reduction of facetenumeration to the decision problem polytopeverification .",
    "then we further reduce to the completeness problem : is a given description of a @xmath10-polytope by _ some _ of its vertices and _ some _ of its facets complete , that is , are we given _ all _ the vertices and _ all _ the facets ?",
    "looking at the convex hull problem via its reduction to polytopeverification or completeness automatically reveals its inherent self - dual structure .",
    "it is an interesting feature that the completeness problem can be posed both with geometric input data and as an entirely combinatorial problem completenessc , where only the incidences between vertices and facets are given .",
    "let us just mention here one recent occurrence of the combinatorial completeness problem : mccarthy et al .",
    "@xcite describe a situation where one wants to know whether a given inequality description for a polytope is complete .",
    "moreover , the vertex coordinates in some of their problems are necessarily non - rational , so any coordinate - free / combinatorial approach is welcome .",
    "unfortunately , the most interesting case left `` open '' by mccarthy et al .",
    "( the convex hull of the matrices corresponding to the coxeter group @xmath12 ) is a polytope completeness problem in dimension @xmath13 with @xmath14 vertices : from this data our method generates gigantic boundary matrices that are plainly too large to process .",
    "also we have been informed by samuel fiorini ( email , january 2002 ) that he has successfully used a certificate for the `` no''-case of completenessc that is similar to the one that we describe in section  [ sec : certificate ] .",
    "our main contribution is an algorithm to attack the combinatorial completenessc problem via deciding whether a certain simplicial homology group of a certain abstract simplicial complex vanishes or not .",
    "moreover , we present a polynomially checkable certificate for non - completeness , provided that the input is valid . for the geometric version",
    "the validity of the input can be checked easily .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity status for the homology computation problem is open .",
    "the best currently available strategy to decide non - triviality of a ( rational ) homology group in question seems to be to compute boundary matrices and perform gauss elimination . since the boundary matrices in our algorithm can be exponentially large ,",
    "we do not obtain an output - sensitive method .",
    "however , like other methods ( e.g. , avis and fukuda s reverse search  @xcite or seidel s gift - wrapping algorithm  @xcite ) our algorithm is output - sensitive in the case of simplicial polytopes .",
    "we start with a more formal description of the facet enumeration problem :    facetenumeration@xmath15 : +    it is known , cf .",
    "avis , bremner & seidel  @xcite , fukuda  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* node  21 ) , and kaibel & pfetsch  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problems 13 ) , that facetenumeration has a polynomial reduction to the polytope verification problem :    polytopeverification@xmath16 : +    freund and orlin could show that a related problem , to decide whether @xmath17 , is co - np - complete @xcite .",
    "assuming that an lp - type oracle is available , the polytopeverification problem is polynomially equivalent to the following _ geometric polytope completeness problem _ :    completenessg@xmath18 : +    as in the case of polytopeverification , the roles of vertices and facets are interchangeable for completenessg .",
    "we sketch the reduction of polytopeverification to completenessg . given any input @xmath16 for polytopeverification , set @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "employ gaussian elimination to determine @xmath21 .",
    "verify whether all the inequalities in  @xmath2 are valid for  @xmath3 ; if this is not the case , then @xmath22 , so we output * no * ; otherwise @xmath23 is established .",
    "now extract the set @xmath24 of all halfspaces from @xmath2 for which @xmath3 lies in the bounding hyperplane , that is , all those inequalities which are tight on  @xmath25 .",
    "an lp - type oracle is sufficient , but also needed @xcite , to check whether @xmath26 ; if this is not the case , then we know that @xmath27 , so we can output * no*. otherwise we proceed by restricting the input to @xmath28 , that is , we deal with the situation where @xmath3 is full - dimensional",
    ".    now remove from @xmath2 all the halfspaces which do not determine facets of  @xmath3 ; this may be done using gaussian elimination .",
    "( in the case @xmath29 , this removal does not change @xmath30 ; in the case @xmath31 , it may enlarge @xmath30 . ) similarly , we now remove from @xmath1 all those points which do not arise as intersections of some bounding hyperplanes of halfspaces in @xmath2 ; again this may be done via gaussian elimination .",
    "( in the case of @xmath29 , this removal does not change @xmath3 ; in the case @xmath31 , we may loose vertices of  @xmath3 , thus making @xmath3 smaller . )",
    "now we have prepared our input for completenessg .",
    "indeed , the first two conditions on the input are satisfied , the other two are easily checked : if one of them fails , then output the answer * no*. @xmath32",
    "the _ incidence matrix _ of a polytope @xmath3 with vertex set  @xmath33 and facet set  @xmath34 is defined to be the matrix @xmath35 where @xmath36 if vertex @xmath37 lies on the facet @xmath38 ( that is , if @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 means that @xmath41 .",
    "this matrix is well - defined up to permutation of rows and of columns , which corresponds to reordering @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "a _ minor _ of a matrix will refer to any submatrix obtained by possibly removing rows and/or columns .",
    "a minor  @xmath42 of the incidence matrix  @xmath43 is _ complete _ if @xmath44 .",
    "thus we arrive at the _ combinatorial polytope completeness problem _ :    completenessc@xmath45 : +    it is not obvious that this problem is well defined .",
    "however , from theorem  [ thm : homology ] below it follows that there are no two @xmath10-polytopes @xmath3 and  @xmath46 such that a @xmath47-matrix  @xmath42 is both a complete incidence matrix for  @xmath3 and an incomplete minor of an incidence matrix for  @xmath46 .",
    "( see also the related discussion in  @xcite . )",
    "it is clear that completenessg has a polynomial reduction to completenessc .",
    "it is essential to have the dimension among the input parameters of completenessc .",
    "this is demonstrated by the following example @xcite : @xmath48 we can identify @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the sets of vertices and facets , respectively , of a @xmath51-dimensional cube ( in a suitable `` klee - minty '' vertex numbering ; see figure  [ fig : pulling ] below ) . consequently , completenessc@xmath52 = * yes*. but we can also identify @xmath33 with the vertices of a cyclic @xmath53-polytope @xmath54 .",
    "then each element in  @xmath34 corresponds to a facet of  @xmath54 , according to gale s evenness criterion .",
    "hence completenessc@xmath55 = * no * , since @xmath54 has @xmath56  facets .",
    "a more generic class of examples for which the dimension information is needed arises from the prism construction : let @xmath3 be an arbitrary @xmath10-polytope and @xmath57 $ ] the prism over  @xmath3 .",
    "the facets of @xmath46 are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the products of facets of  @xmath3 with the interval  @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "call the latter facets of  @xmath46 _ vertical _ , and let @xmath61 be an incidence matrix of  @xmath3 .",
    "we have completenessc@xmath62 = * yes*. on the other hand @xmath61 is also a minor of an incidence matrix of  @xmath46 , which corresponds to the vertical facets and , say , the vertices in the bottom facet @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , completenessc@xmath63 = * no*.",
    "we will point out that completenessc has a topological core .",
    "the reader is referred to bjrner  @xcite for a survey of topological combinatorics tools , and to munkres  @xcite for a presentation of simplicial homology . in the following",
    "we will use reduced simplicial homology with coefficients in @xmath64 .",
    "one could use any other commutative coefficient ring with unit , but @xmath64 is the natural choice in terms of efficiency and simplicity .",
    "we choose non - reduced homology to simplify notation for the trivial case  @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be an incidence matrix minor of some polytope  @xmath3 with vertex set  @xmath67 and facet set @xmath68 .",
    "thus the columns of @xmath42 are in bijection with a ( partial ) vertex set @xmath33 of  @xmath3 .",
    "each row of @xmath42 is the characteristic vector of a subset of rows , i.e. , of a subset of  @xmath33 .",
    "thus in the following we interpret @xmath42 as a combinatorial encoding of a system @xmath34 of ( not necessarily distinct ) subsets of  @xmath33 , and with slight abuse of notation we write @xmath69 .",
    "the _ crosscut complex _ of  @xmath42 is the simplicial complex @xmath70 the simplicial complex of all sets of vertices that are contained in _ some _ facet in  @xmath34 .",
    "[ thm : homology ] the incidence matrix minor  @xmath66 of a @xmath10-polytope is complete if and only if @xmath71 .",
    "the set @xmath72 is a compact subset of the boundary of  @xmath3 : for every `` given '' facet @xmath38 of",
    "@xmath3 , it contains the convex hull of all `` given '' vertices .",
    "thus @xmath73 is a polyhedral complex , called a _ partial polytope _ ,",
    "covered by its convex ( and hence contractible ) cells @xmath74 . according to the nerve theorem @xcite",
    ", the crosscut complex @xmath75 has the same homotopy type as the set  @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the homology of the set @xmath73 and of the crosscut complex coincide . for an example of the crosscut complex of a partial polytope see figure  [ fig : crosscut ] .    in the * yes * case ,",
    "if the sets of vertices and facets both are complete , @xmath73 is the complete boundary of  @xmath3 , homeomorphic to @xmath76 , so we have @xmath77 .    in the * no * case , if the vertex or the facet list is incomplete , then @xmath73 is a proper subset of @xmath78 , which is a subcomplex of a suitable triangulation of @xmath79 , so it can not have @xmath80-dimensional homology .",
    "the complexity status of the problem to compute the rank of an arbitrary homology group , or even to decide whether a certain homology group vanishes , seems to be open ; see kaibel & pfetsch  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  33 ) .",
    "thus currently our best option is based on explicitly computing simplicial homology via boundary matrices , as in algorithm  [ alg : completenessviahomology ] .    to estimate the costs of this computation ,",
    "suppose that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and that the maximum cardinality of any facet equals  @xmath83 .",
    "thus @xmath84 , and every row of @xmath42 contains at most @xmath83 ones .",
    "then the size of the relevant boundary matrices is bounded from above by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we use gaussian elimination over  @xmath64 to compute the rank and the corank , respectively .",
    "the algorithm completenessviahomology@xmath45 has a polynomial running time if @xmath83 is bounded by @xmath87 , for an absolute constant @xmath88 .",
    "the latter case is , in fact , interesting : a @xmath10-polytope is _ simplicial _ if each proper face is a simplex or , equivalently , each facet contains exactly @xmath10 vertices .",
    "we infer that the running time of completenessviahomology for simplicial polytopes is bounded by  @xmath89 .",
    "it has been observed by bremner , fukuda & marzetta  @xcite that facetenumeration for a polytope  @xmath3 is polynomially equivalent to facetenumeration for the dual polytope  @xmath90 . using our techniques , a similar result can be obtained directly . if @xmath91 is an incidence matrix for  @xmath3 , then the transposed matrix  @xmath92 is an incidence matrix for  @xmath90 .",
    "any minor @xmath42 of  @xmath91 is complete if and only if its transpose is a complete minor of  @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to the following modification of our algorithm .",
    "while @xmath83 was defined above as the maximal row size of the input incidence matrix minor , define @xmath93 thus we modify our algorithm : it should first compare the sizes of the primal and the dual problem , and then perform the ( reduced ) homology computation for the smaller problem . the modified algorithm completenessviahomology@xmath45 has polynomial running time if @xmath94 is bounded by `` @xmath10 plus a constant . '' in particular , this yields an @xmath95-algorithm for the completenessc problem specialized to polytopes which are simplicial or _",
    "simple _ , that is , dual to a simplicial polytope .",
    "we note , however , that these running times are neither optimal nor the best available : the reverse search algorithm of avis and fukuda  @xcite computes the convex hull ( and thereby solves completenessg ) of a simplicial polytope in  @xmath96 steps .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath10-polytope with ordered vertex set @xmath97 and facet set  @xmath98 .",
    "inductively , define a sequence @xmath99 of polytopal subdivisions of the boundary complex  @xmath79 : set @xmath100 . in order to obtain @xmath101 replace each facet  @xmath38 of  @xmath102 which contains  @xmath103 by the set of cones with apex  @xmath103 over those facets of  @xmath38 which do not contain  @xmath103 .",
    "the final subdivision is a triangulation @xmath104 of  @xmath79 , the _ pulling triangulation _",
    "@xcite with respect to the chosen ordering of  @xmath33 . for",
    "an example of a pulling triangulation see figure  [ fig : pulling ] .",
    "the pulling triangulation of @xmath79 has several nice properties ( not shared , for example , by the `` placing triangulation '' ) which may be exploited for our purposes .",
    "first , its combinatorics is determined by the combinatorics of @xmath3 ; see below .",
    "furthermore , if we use a linear ordering of the vertex set @xmath105 in which the vertices in  @xmath33 come first , then the corresponding pulling triangulation of the boundary of  @xmath3 contains @xmath73 as a subcomplex .",
    "let us now identify the vertex set  @xmath105 with the set @xmath106=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] and each facet  @xmath107 with the subset of  @xmath106 $ ] that corresponds to the vertices contained in  @xmath38 .",
    "thus any triangulation of  @xmath79 is encoded by a collection of @xmath10-subsets of  @xmath106 $ ] , that is , to a subset of @xmath108}{d}$ ] .",
    "we write @xmath109 for a @xmath10-subset of  @xmath106 $ ] with @xmath110 .",
    "[ lem : pulling ] let @xmath3 be a @xmath10-polytope whose vertex set is labeled by  @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "+ then a set @xmath111}{d}$ ] corresponds to a facet of the pulling triangulation of  @xmath79 ( with respect to the chosen vertex labeling ) if and only if there is a complete flag of faces @xmath112 such that @xmath113 is the smallest vertex in  @xmath114 for @xmath115 , that is , if there are facets @xmath116 of  @xmath3 such that @xmath117 for  @xmath115 .",
    "every pulling facet @xmath109 lies in a facet @xmath118 of  @xmath3 , with @xmath119 .",
