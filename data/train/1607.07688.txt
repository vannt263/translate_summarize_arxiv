    "in dipolar spin ices such as dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the interplay of the local @xmath5 anisotropy with the dipolar and superexchange interactions is such that the groundstate of a single tetrahedron obeys the ice rule ( two spins point in and two point out )  @xcite .",
    "the ice rule is a local constraint which can be coarse grained to a non - divergent field  @xcite - an example of a coulomb phase  @xcite - and the excitations , which are local violations of this rule , can be identified as emergent magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "the monopolar nature of the excitations and their charge is best exposed by the so - called dumbbell model  @xcite .",
    "each magnetic moment is replaced by a dumbbell carrying a magnetic charge @xmath6 at each end .",
    "satisfaction of the ice rule corresponds to ensuring charge neutrality at the center of each tetrahedron , while flipping a spin produces an equal and opposite excess of charge at two adjacent tetrahedron centers .",
    "subsequent spin flips can restore the ice rule at the center of tetrahedra , in the wake of a hopping monopole excitation , so that low temperature properties of a spin ice can be described by a magnetic coulomb gas .",
    "the magnitude of the charge @xmath7 , which is an essential property in theories of coulomb gases , can be derived from the size of the magnetic moment @xmath8 , and the separation of the tetrahedron centers , which is expressed in terms of the lattice constant of the diamond lattice formed by the tetrahedron centers , @xmath9 : @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "if the lattice constant ( or magnetic moment ) were to depend on temperature within the window of the effective theory , this could introduce a renormalization of the monopole charge which should be quantified .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the low temperature lattice parameters have not been accurately measured in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is closely related to the spin ices , but has a quite contrasting low temperature behavior , in which a correlated but disordered magnetic state remains fluctuating to the lowest measured temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is not understood how this frustration can occur , since the antiferromagnetically interacting @xmath5 ising moments of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 should realize the unfrustrated counterpoint of the ice rule ( all four spins point either in or out of the tetrahedron ) .",
    "one aspect of the low temperature state which has been emphasized in some experimental works , and which is not a feature of the spin ices , is the strong magnetoelastic coupling . in the temperature window where the spin correlations build up ( i.e. @xmath12 k )  @xcite , various elastic properties  @xcite also become anomalous , and spin and lattice excitations",
    "are hybridized  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this magnetoelastic coupling apparently does not resolve the frustration .",
    "one particular demonstration of this coupling was the measurement of developing lattice strain using single crystal x - ray diffraction  @xcite .",
    "again in the temperature window where the spin correlations develop , certain structural bragg peaks were found to broaden anisotropically . in the same experiments",
    ", it was observed that tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 enters a regime of negative thermal expansion at low temperature ( @xmath13 k ) ) .",
    "this latter result has been debated , with x - ray powder diffraction experiments employed to show that there is no negative thermal expansion  @xcite .",
    "here we use the neutron larmor diffraction technique , which provides access to both the thermal expansion and lattice strain in the same experiment , to revisit this question .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the neutron larmor diffraction technique for interested readers ; summarize our experimental methods ; before presenting the results of our experiments on the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter and strain of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ; followed by discussions and conclusions .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath2 measured by scanning the position @xmath14 of the final radio - frequency ( rf ) spin flipper coil at fixed frequency @xmath15khz . here , the thermal expansion of the lattice of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 amounts to @xmath16 between @xmath17 and 96.3k .",
    "panel c : phase dependence of the polarization in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 at @xmath17k .",
    "the resulting width of the lattice spacing distributions is @xmath18 , and the filled point indicates the phase ( frequency ) at which the precession scans presented in panel b were performed . ]",
    "this section provides a brief introduction to neutron larmor diffraction ( ld ) for readers who are unfamiliar with the technique , full details can be found in refs .",
    "the main purpose of ld is to obtain precise values of the lattice constant , or relative changes of it ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , and it also provides the distribution of @xmath20-spacings ( which we call @xmath21 ) .",
    "readers not concerned with the details of how these are obtained can just look at the measurements of these quantities reported in section  [ sec : results ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_raw ] summarizes the basic principle of the ld experiment , and shows examples of the typical types of data which are obtained from a ld experiment .",
    "the incident neutron beam is polarized , and the polarization of the scattered beam is analyzed .",
    "the sample is held in the conventional condition for neutron bragg diffraction ( i.e. the scattering vector @xmath22 bisects @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , but before and after the sample the spin of the neutrons is made to precess , as the neutrons traverse regions of precisely known dimensions ( further details follow ) . in contrast to the neutron spin echo technique , however , the precession regions are such that total the larmor phase @xmath25 adds up .",
    "since @xmath26 depends on the path length , and therefore the @xmath20-spacing , as @xmath27 , and has a typical magnitude of 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 rad , ld is an elegant method to probe small changes in the lattice parameter .",
    "limitations in conventional diffraction measurements of the lattice spacing , such as beam divergence , are overcome by the larmor labelling , and the technique can be used throughout the extremes of the parameter space accessible by neutron scattering , for example down to low temperatures or as a function of pressure @xcite .",
    "the precession region is actually defined by four radio - frequency spin flipper coils , as in neutron resonance spin echo  @xcite .",
    "the coils are oriented precisely parallel to the lattice planes , which has the practical advantage of creating sharp boundaries for the precession region .",
    "three quantities can be varied in the experiment : an external parameter ( in our case the temperature ) , the precession frequency @xmath30 ( set by the rf flipper frequency ) , and the path length @xmath31 ( modified by driving the final flipper coil backwards or forwards along the spectrometer arm ) .",
    "modification of @xmath31 at fixed @xmath30 effectively controls the precession time of the neutrons , such that when the final polarization is analyzed , a sinusoidal intensity dependence is obtained as the coil position scans the phase of the precession .",
    "an example of this type of measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_raw]b .",
    "the phase shift is due to a change in the lattice spacing , which we can extract from the relation @xmath32 .",
    "measuring the polarization as a function of the total larmor phase @xmath33 yields additional information on the crystal lattice .",
    "@xmath26 depends on the larmor frequency , which is set by the rf - flipper frequency . for a given physical configuration of the instrument and sample ,",
    "the polarization decays at higher frequencies due to dephasing by the distribution of @xmath20-spacings in the sample .",
    "in fact , the polarization as a function of @xmath26 is the cosine fourier transform of the lattice spacing distribution @xmath21 .",
    "an example for this measurement is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_raw]c .",
    "generally , both the frequency dependence of the polarization and @xmath21 are assumed to be gaussian , hence their widths are connected inversely .",
    "the rare earth titanate pyrochlore samples used for this experiment have all been previously reported .",
    "the crystal of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is a large single crystal ( @xmath34 g ) grown in an image furnace and post - annealed under oxygen  @xcite .",
    "it was used in investigations of the diffuse scattering  @xcite .",
    "the crystal of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is also large ( @xmath34 g ) , and has been used in investigations of diffuse scattering  @xcite and magnetoelastic excitations  @xcite .",
    "its characterization by x - ray diffraction and specific heat measurements have been discussed in refs .  [ ] and  [ ] ( it does not have the specific heat peak found in some tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 samples  @xcite ) .",
    "the dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal  @xcite is somewhat smaller ( @xmath35 g ) because it is isotopically enriched with @xmath36dy to reduce the large absorption cross section of natural isotopic abundance dysprosium .",
    "it is the same crystal used for the measurement of magnetic diffuse scattering  @xcite , but before the ld study it was re - annealed in oxygen to eliminate possible oxygen vacancies  @xcite .",

    ", an incident wave vector of @xmath40 @xmath41 was used to perform ld measurements at the @xmath42 bragg reflection .",
    "the same bragg reflection was measured in the spin ices , but to account for their slightly smaller lattice constants , the incident wave vector was adjusted to @xmath43 @xmath41 .",
    "this method allowed us to maintain a constant scattering angle of @xmath44 and therefore constant tilting angles of the precession coils throughout the experiment - it is desirable to maintain the same scattering geometry for all samples in order to minimize sources of error .",
    "a perfect germanium single crystal with a well - determined lattice constant of @xmath45    was used as a reference sample ( again adjusting @xmath46 to measure the @xmath47 reflection without repositioning the spectrometer ) .",

    "the thermal expansion was measured in a single temperature sweep , maintaining a fixed flipper frequency of 200 hz , in order to ensure the stability of the radio - frequency and temperature of the coils . before or after stabilization of the set up for a temperature sweep ,",
    "we visited selected points across the full temperature region , where we determined the distribution of the lattice spacings @xmath21 .",

    "k , no thermal expansion can be distinguished in any of the compounds , within the resolution of larmor diffraction ( which is in principle of the order of @xmath53 , but here , and generally in practice , is of the order of @xmath4 ) . the error on the lattice parameter at a particular temperature",
    "is kept small by the robust fitting of the sinusoidal intensity function over four periods .",
    "when we report the absolute lattice parameters ( see below ) , the error bar originates from the spread of repeated observations visible in the second inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_tdep ] .    in the temperature region @xmath54",
    "k , the thermal expansion of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 follows a @xmath55 dependence , as might be expected for a system whose lattice and thermal properties are purely controlled by acoustic phonons in this temperature range .",
    "there is no obvious reason why this is not also the case for ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "likewise , our data also do not show any evidence of negative thermal expansion , but they do clearly show an anomaly in the temperature dependence at @xmath57 k. although the lattice of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 begins to expand at @xmath58 k , the expansion is interrupted by a plateau at @xmath59 k , before expansion continues as the temperature is increased further .",

    "[ ] , while it is qualitatively described , but not shown , in ref .",
    "the lattices of all three compounds continue to expand smoothly at higher temperatures ( i.e. @xmath60 k ) .",
    "it is notable that the relative expansion of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 accelerates more rapidly than either tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 or dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , such that while it is the smallest at @xmath51 k , it has become the largest at @xmath61 k. when looking at the curves of @xmath62 vs. @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_tdep ] , one may gain the impression that the rates of expansion of the three compounds have subtle departures from monotonicity .",
    "for example , between 30 and 150 k , the curves for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 seem to approach one another , then separate , and then converge and cross . since the three compounds have identical structures and closely related phonon band structures  @xcite",
    ", the simple expectation would be that they expand identically , with some small renormalization related to the change in mass of the rare earth ion .",

    "[ fig : larmor_alpha ] .",
    "the thermal expansion data of fig .  [ fig : larmor_tdep ] was piecewise interpolated with weighted polynomials .",
    "the derivative of the interpolated thermal expansion is calculated with a centered five - point stencil , and three - point or one - sided numerical derivatives at its ends .",
    "the derivatives can depend on the spacing of the temperature points ( @xmath65 used in the interpolation , and the degree of the polynomial .",
    "we have tested the effect of both parameters to establish sensible values   k the data is best described by fixing the polynomial order to 6 , and using a large temperature spacing ( @xmath66 k for @xmath48ho , tb , and @xmath67 k for @xmath48dy ) .",

    "features in the temperature dependence of @xmath77 should be interpreted carefully , but the features we discuss appear to be reasonably robust , and this presentation helps to emphasize effects which are not immediately visible in @xmath78 .",

    "we did not observe any negative thermal expansion in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , but we did observe an anomaly in the lattice contraction .",
    "previously , we have shown that the first excited crystal field ( cef1 at 1.5 mev or 17.4 k ) is coupled with a transverse acoustic phonon forming a hybrid magnetoelastic mode ( mem ) , and this coupling develops at @xmath92 k. the plateau in @xmath62 ( or minimum in @xmath49 ) occurs exactly in the temperature range where the hybridization develops  @xcite , and the appearance of this feature only in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is a clear sign that it originates in a spin - lattice effect that is absent in the other two compounds .",
    "an important point about this observation is that it was made in a single crystal of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "a central criticism of the observation of negative thermal expansion  @xcite was that the properties of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals are variable , while powders are reproducible , though none of the samples involved were characterized to the degree that tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 samples typically are now  @xcite .",

    "@xcite seems to be a robust observation .",
    "since our experiment was conducted at the @xmath42 reflection , we are sensitive to the longitudinal broadening that they observed at @xmath94 . we observed a strong increase in the distribution @xmath21 below 20 k , in agreement with the findings of ruff  _ et al._. although the strain broadening has not been observed in the powder diffraction experiments , it is not obvious that it can be observed in a conventional powder diffraction experiment .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : larmor_strain ] that the development of lattice strain at low temperatures in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 occurs in the temperature window in which the mem appears .",
    "we also recently showed that the transition at 17 mev , or 197 k , is also coupled to a transverse optical phonon ( top ) , forming a bound state  @xcite .",
    "although we do not have a detailed temperature dependence of @xmath21 , it is clear that the lattice strain relaxes further at this temperature scale .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath95 is more detailed and does reveal a minimum at @xmath96 k , close to the energy of the crystal field / top bound state .",
    "this feature also appears only in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and not the spin ices , indicating that it also originates in a spin - lattice coupling only present in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the minimum appears at the onset of the formation of the bound state , in close similarity with the minimum at @xmath97 k , at the onset of the formation of the mem . due to the much higher temperature of the bound state , its onset",
    "is spread over a larger temperature range than the one of the mem , and hence the minimum is broader .",
    "the relation between lattice strain and the coupling of excited crystal field levels with phonons has been investigated in compounds such as tmpo@xmath98 and tmvo@xmath98  @xcite .",
    "it was found that if the phonons are coupled to degenerate ( doublet ) ground states , a cooperative jahn - teller transition occurs , while if the phonons are coupled to a degenerate excited state above a singlet ground state , no transition occurs since the ground state is any way unique , but lattice strains build up as the crystal field state is depopulated .",
    "this points to a general explanation of the development of the lattice strains that we observed . in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the crystal field states are simply too high in energy to have any strong effect within the temperature window of this study . in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "the first excitation is a little lower , apparently sufficient to see a relaxation in the strain only at the highest measured temperature , while in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the consequences of depopulating two excited states with important coupling to phonons can be seen .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lattice strain is of similar magnitudes in all three compounds .",
    "while it is now suggested that tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals may be inhomogeneous  @xcite , we find that the lattice strain of our tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal ( and ld probes the bulk of a large crystal ) is not generally larger than the other two compounds .",
    "in addition to the effects visible in @xmath62 and @xmath95 which are unique to the spin - lattice coupling in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , there are temperature scales that appear to be relevant to all three compounds , and therefore derive from pure lattice effects .",

    "the second is @xmath100 k , where there are inflections in @xmath95 for ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , which we correlate with an anomaly in the elastic constants that was reported by nakanishi _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for all three compounds and suggested to be due to a structural transition of unknown type .",
    "we do not have sufficient data to conclude that the effect we observe is unique to ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , so suppose it to be the same effect observed by nakanishi _",
    "et al . _ , and to appear in all three compounds .",
    "all of these changes in the rate of thermal expansion appear to derive from the thermal population of bundles of optical phonons .",
    "we recently reported the phonon band structure of the three compounds  @xcite , which is almost identical , and contains several low lying optical phonons at @xmath101 mev and @xmath102 mev .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient may be written in terms of the mode grneisen parameters and temperature derivative of the phonon mode occupation numbers  @xcite .",
    "for the optical modes in question , the two temperature scales correspond to rapid growth in the latter quantity .",
    "no further evidence for the structural phase transition at @xmath100 k proposed in ref .   has been advanced , and we now believe that the observed anomaly in the elastic constants is explained by a strongly temperature dependent contribution to the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "mamsurova _ et al_. observed peaks in the internal friction of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , at 40 k and 110 k  @xcite , more or less corresponding to the boundary of the two lattice features in @xmath95 .",
    "they could observe these peaks , at the same temperatures , in all rare earth titanate pyrochlores , including y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "they related these to dielectric anomalies that they had previously observed  @xcite , stating that these also occurred at the same temperatures , though in fact they are at 30 k and 80 k , in close correspondence with our anomalies in @xmath95 .",
    "these dielectric anomalies were attributed to the formation of two types of dipoles in the sample with different frequencies , probably due to the motion of anion vacancies or interstitial cations , though no explanation of the temperature scales was made  @xcite .",
    "all the modes in the low - lying optical phonon bundles have @xmath103 character  @xcite , and hence are dipole active .",
    "we therefore suggest that the population of these modes is an alternative and plausible explanation for the anomalies observed in refs .  .",
    "firstly , we would expect defect motions to occur at rather higher temperatures ; secondly , our explanation is also consistent with their other tests ( the anomalies disappear in other rare earth titanate crystal structures , as they must since the phonon spectrum is different ; the anomalies exist only in titanates and not zirconates , and as discussed in ref .",
    ", replacement of titanium by zirconium also modifies the phonon density of states ) .    finally , we point out that this is the first use of larmor diffraction to study the rare earth titanates .",
    "our study covered the temperature range @xmath104 k , as it was convenient to use the @xmath28he refrigerator to study all three compounds .",
    "recently it has been suggested that there is a quadrupole ordering transition in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 at a temperature of @xmath105 k  @xcite , only observable in crystals of very high quality or powders .",
    "larmor diffraction could be used to study the transition in a small crystal with directly verified heat capacity - since the signal is proportional to bragg intensity , even a relatively small sample can be used . a subtle lattice anomaly related to a quadrupole ordering",
    "might be detected in this way .",
    "we have used larmor diffraction to investigate the thermal expansion , lattice strain , and absolute values of the lattice constants of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , in the temperature range @xmath104 k. we report the absolute values of the lattice constants at low temperature in the context of the charge of the emergent magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice .",
    "we found no evidence of negative thermal expansion in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , but nonetheless observe various anomalies in the thermal expansion @xmath19 and thermal expansion coefficient @xmath95 . some of these , in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 could be related to interactions between crystal field and phonon excitations , while others that occur in all three compounds could be connected with the phonon band structure .",
    "we did confirm that lattice strain does increase at low temperature in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , as previously reported .",
    "the general behavior of the lattice strain is also suggested to be related to the interaction of excited crystal field levels and phonons , if a compound has levels which may couple to phonons , in the temperature window of the experiment .",
