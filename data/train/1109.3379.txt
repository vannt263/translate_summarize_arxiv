    "let us first consider the most intriguing possibility of spontaneous generation in pt symmetric systems . in this case",
    "the input state of photons is @xmath38 .",
    "further the quantum noise in the absorber does not contribute to the normally ordered moments and thus only @xmath18 terms contribute to spontaneous generation . using eq.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) we can show that the spontaneous generation , denoted by the symbol @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "we have calculated analytically the matrix @xmath42 and the generated signals .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , the nature of the spontaneous generation for different values of the gain both below and above threshold @xmath43 .",
    "the threshold is defined by the condition that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath27 change from pure imaginary to pure real values .",
    "we note from the fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] that the generation in the waveguide b starts later as initially the generation has to take place in the waveguide a and this must tunnel into the waveguide b to see the generation in the waveguide b. for large @xmath44 the generation in the waveguide a dominates over that in b @xmath45",
    "we next examine the hbt  @xcite cross correlation between the outputs of the two waveguides .",
    "we expect such a cross correlation to be nonzero as the generation in b is due to generation in a and due to tunneling effects .",
    "let us define a correlation coefficient as @xmath46 the term @xmath47 is proportional to the probability of simultaneously detecting one photon each in the output of both a and b waveguides .",
    "this can be evaluated by using the gaussian nature of the langevin forces @xmath18 and @xmath22 which implies that the heisenberg operators are also gaussian with the provision that we need to keep track of the operator characteristics .",
    "this applies only to the problem of spontaneous generation .",
    "it can be shown using the gaussian property that @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 the term @xmath50 is obtained from ( [ 4 ] ) as @xmath51 the nature of the vacuum induced hbt cross correlation between the outputs of the two waveguides is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "the behavior of the hbt correlation is quite different for @xmath52 and @xmath31 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the correlation saturates to unity , whereas for @xmath52 , it tends to remain , in most cases , much smaller than unity .",
    "this is due to the distinction in the nature of the eigenvalues as discussed after eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "thus for large gain , the correlations or the fluctuations are maximally gaussian in the sense that the maximum value of @xmath53 can be @xmath54 , and hence maximum value of @xmath55 will be @xmath56 .",
    "we would now consider the stimulated generation by single photon input states and compare the stimulated generation with spontaneous generation .",
    "the stimulated generation comes from the terms @xmath57 in eq.([4 ] ) . for the input @xmath35 the stimulated generation",
    "is given by @xmath58 whereas for the input single photon in the waveguide b , the stimulated generation is given by @xmath59 note that for large propagation distance and @xmath31 , the stimulated generation is determined by @xmath60 hence asymptotically negligibly small output is there from the waveguide b. in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] we present explicit results for the stimulated generation and the total generation for the input single photon either in the waveguide a or in b. the stimulated part is same as from eq.([1 ] ) and hence labeled as `` cl''(classical ) in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] .",
    "the curves labeled as `` qm''(quantum ) include contributions from both stimulated and spontaneous generation .",
    "the behavior is quite different for @xmath52 and for @xmath31 . for @xmath52",
    ", we find that total generation of photons is dominated by spontaneous generation .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for @xmath31 .",
    "however , spontaneous generation still remains quite important .",
    "lastly we examine the behavior of optical fields in pt symmetric systems when the input fields are in a noon state  @xcite @xmath37 which is an entangled state . for this state @xmath53",
    "has the least value which is zero .",
    "the mean intensity of emission has a behavior similar to that in case of the state @xmath35 @xmath61 the probability of finding one photon in each waveguide is now calculated using the full solution ( [ 4 ] ) and is found to be the sum of three different types of contributions : ( i ) stimulated ones @xmath62 ; ( ii ) purely from spontaneous emission @xmath63 ; ( iii ) cross terms involving both spontaneous and stimulated emission @xmath64 we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] the correlation @xmath53 in case if we completely ignore spontaneous generation , i.e. the result with @xmath65 , and compare with the full result  which includes all the three contributions as mentioned above .",
    "the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig.5]c can be understood in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath28 of @xmath27 for @xmath52 , as in this case we have periodic exchange of energy between the two waveguides .",
    "[ fig.5]c and fig .",
    "[ fig.5]d show that @xmath53 is mostly less than unity if the spontaneous generation is ignored whereas the inclusion of spontaneous emission changes the character of @xmath53 completely ( fig .",
    "[ fig.5]a and fig .",
    "[ fig.5]b ) .",
    "thus noninclusion of spontaneous emission would lead to erroneous conclusion that the fields in pt symmetric system are nonclassical whereas the correct behavior leads to nonclassicality only over a small range of propagation distance .    in summary",
    "we have shown how important is the spontaneous generation of photons in pt symmetric optical systems .",
    "we show significant hbt correlations in the generated photon fields .",
    "the spontaneously generated photons strongly correlate eigenmodes and determine the quantum nature of the fields containing single and entangled photons in such systems .",
    "there are many other important systems involving for example the lossless propagation in plasmonic structures  @xcite where losses are compensated by gain media .",
    "while dealing with quantum fields in such structures one has to supplement maxwell equations with quantum langevin terms of the type discussed in the current work .",
    "these ideas would also be applicable , say , in the context of matter waves where a whole class of potentials including complex ones can be constructed by using off resonant laser fields  @xcite .      1 c. m. bender and s. boettcher .",
