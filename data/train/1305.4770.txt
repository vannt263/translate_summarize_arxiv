    "the rheology of glassy solids and dense complex fluids poses intriguing questions of both fundamental and practical importance .",
    "systems of interest include noncrystalline solids such as structural glasses and polymers , soft particulate systems such as emulsions and colloidal suspensions , granular materials , and a wide variety of biological substances . when driven externally , such systems exhibit complex rheological responses that go beyond those of simple fluids and elastic solids . in @xcite",
    ", we refer the reader to a few recent review papers that we have found helpful in exploring these topics .",
    "our theoretical challenge is to describe the complex microscopic dynamics of such systems by relatively simple , macroscopic , continuum equations .",
    "we argue here that there are two related , fundamental aspects of these systems that are essential ingredients of predictive theories .",
    "first , there is a natural distinction between slow configurational ( i.e. structural ) degrees of freedom and fast kinetic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this distinction allows us to apply the principles of statistical thermodynamics to the configurational and kinetic subsystems separately , and thus to describe what happens when they fall out of equilibrium with each other in response to external driving forces .",
    "second , we assert that the memory of prior , irreversible deformations of these systems must be carried by properly defined internal state variables , which satisfy physically motivated equations of motion , and whose present values determine subsequent behavior @xcite . in what follows , we outline this nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework and describe some of its applications .",
    "equilibrium statistical thermodynamics is a well established bridge between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems @xcite .",
    "driven glassy systems , however , are not in thermodynamic equilibrium ; thus it sometimes is argued that thermodynamics is not relevant to them .",
    "we disagree .",
    "the starting point of our counter argument is the observation that the evolution of the configurational ( structural ) degrees of freedom of a glass is much slower than , and is only weakly coupled to , the fast dynamics of the kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "the configurational degrees of freedom are the mechanically stable positions of the glassy elements ( atoms , molecules , colloidal particles , etc . ) in their inherent structures @xcite .",
    "the kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom are the momenta and the positional fluctuations about the inherent structures , caused by ordinary thermal or brownian motions .    for the dense systems of interest here , spontaneous configurational rearrangements  activated transitions from one inherent structure to another",
    " are extremely infrequent on the time scales of the kinetic - vibrational fluctuations .",
    "it is in this sense that the configurational degrees of freedom are weakly coupled to the fast kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this separation of time scales , and the associated weak coupling , suggests that the two sets of degrees of freedom can be described approximately as two thermodynamic subsystems in weak contact with each other , in analogy to the standard thermodynamic situation in which heat flows between neighboring subsystems .",
    "our case is different only in the sense that our two subsystems are not spatially separated from each other .",
    "we further assume that the kinetic - vibrational degrees of freedom equilibrate with a thermal reservoir on microscopic time scales , independent of the driving forces .",
    "( note that , in athermal glassy systems ",
    "e.g. granular materials or foams  where the `` atoms '' are macroscopic , no such equilibration takes place . )",
    "we also assume that the external driving forces act primarily , but not always exclusively , on the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "to formulate this physical picture more accurately , we need first to write down the laws of thermodynamics for the two subsystems . for simplicity",
    ", we specialize to a spatially homogeneous system of volume @xmath0 under the application of a purely deviatoric ( shear - like , non - hydrostatic ) stress @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the first and second laws of thermodynamics for the system as a whole take the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total internal energy , @xmath4 is the total rate of deformation ( strain rate ) and @xmath5 is the total entropy .",
    "the essence of the two - subsystem idea is that we can assign well - defined internal energies and entropies to both the configurational ( denoted by a c - subscript ) and kinetic - vibrational ( denoted by a k - subscript ) subsystems , leading to @xcite @xmath6 note that the reservoir degrees of freedom are included in the k - subsystem , which implies that the k - subsystem equilibrates instantaneously with the reservoir .",
    "this assumption can easily be relaxed @xcite .",
    "moreover , note that it is assumed here that we can define entropies in nonequilibrium situations .",
    "( see below . )    to make an explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics for each of the subsystems , assume that the elastic strain is small enough that the total rate of deformation ( common to both subsystems ) can be decomposed as @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the elastic rate of deformation that involves no configurational changes and no dissipation in the c - subsystem , and @xmath9 is the plastic ( inelastic ) rate of deformation that involves configurational changes and dissipation .",
    "furthermore , the stress can be decomposed into partial stresses , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a dissipative stress that is associated with the k - subsystem ( e.g. a hydrodynamic viscous stress due to the solvent in colloidal glasses ) . with these definitions ,",
    "the first law of thermodynamics takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rate of heat flow from the c - subsystem to the k - subsystem .",
    "equations ( [ subsystems_1st_law_c ] ) and ( [ subsystems_1st_law_k ] ) sum to give the standard first law in eq .",
    "( [ thermo_laws ] ) .    in this version of the theory ,",
    "elastic deformations are exclusively associated with the c - subsystem .",
    "( this is not the case when hydrostatic stresses are considered @xcite . )",
    "the plastic part of the mechanical power , @xmath14 , is associated with the c - subsystem , which implies that heat exchange between the subsystems is possible only through @xmath13 , which , by itself , might depend on @xmath9 . in principle",
    ", we might consider the possibility that part of the plastic power is directly converted into ordinary heat and flows to the k - subsystem , in which case a fraction of @xmath14 would appear in the first - law equation for the k - subsystem , and only its complementary part in the c - subsystem @xcite .",
    "to further examine the physical implications of eqs .",
    "( [ subsystems_1st_law_c])-([subsystems_1st_law_k ] ) and the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath15 , we must be more explicit about the functional dependences of the internal energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "specifically , we now must introduce internal state variables .    a theory of irreversible deformation and flow must include equations of motion for a set of coarse grained , internal state variables , denoted here by @xmath18 , where the subscript @xmath19 is a discrete index that denotes the members of the set @xcite . for example , this set may contain the numbers of vacancies or flow defects , or the populations of chemical species",
    ". it must be complete enough that knowledge of the current values of the @xmath18 suffices to predict future behavior .",
    "the @xmath18 must , at least in principle , be observable quantities .",
    "for example , the accumulated plastic strain is not an acceptable member of this set because the undeformed state from which it might be measured is not observable .    in equilibrium , the values @xmath20 are determined thermodynamically ; hence , internal state variables do not appear explicitly in equations of state .",
    "they are essential , however , for describing nonequilibrium dynamics . for simplicity ,",
    "assume that the @xmath18 belong only to the configurational subsystem . also assume , as noted above , that the elastic deformations @xmath21 are associated only with the c - subsystem , where @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the functional dependences of the internal energies are @xmath23    statistical mechanics restricts the definition and use of internal state variables in nonequilibrium situations  a fact that sometimes is missed in the literature . to see this , it is instructive to invert @xmath24 in favor of @xmath25 .",
    "away from equilibrium , when the @xmath18 are not determined by @xmath16 and @xmath21 , the entropy @xmath26 must be defined as the logarithm of the number of configurations available at given @xmath16 and @xmath21 , _ further constrained _ by fixing the nonequilibrium values of the @xmath18 @xcite . for this prescription to make sense , however ,",
    "the equilibrated , constrained entropy @xmath27 must be the same as the equilibrated unconstrained entropy @xmath28 .",
    "this can be true only in the thermodynamic limit of indefinitely large systems , and then only if the set @xmath18 contains just a small , non - extensive , number of variables .",
    "most importantly , the entropies associated with these variables must be included explicitly in @xmath25 .",
    "for example , if one of the @xmath29 is a number of defects , say @xmath30 , then an explicit part of @xmath26 must be the logarithm of the number of ways in which those @xmath30 defects can be distributed in the volume @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic derivatives of @xmath16 and @xmath17 play central roles in this thermodynamic framework .",
    "the configurational stress @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .",
    "most importantly , there are _ two _ relevant temperatures @xcite : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the ordinary temperature of the kinetic - vibrational subsystem , which is the same as the temperature of the heat reservoir .",
    "@xmath35 is the thermodynamic temperature of the configurational subsystem , usually called the `` effective temperature '' @xcite .",
    "it characterizes the state of structural disorder of a glassy system , and thus evolves during deformation and flow . typically , but not always , the configurational degrees of freedom of a glassy system are `` hotter '' than the kinetic - vibrational ones , @xmath36 .    with these definitions",
    ", we can rewrite the second law in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 i.e. the difference between rates of plastic work done and energy stored , is the configurational heat produced during deformation and flow .",
    "the entropy production terms in the second law inequality of ( [ entropy_product ] ) have distinct physical meanings .",
    "the first two terms describe the entropy generated due to dissipation in the c- and k - subsystems , respectively .",
    "the last term describes entropy generation due to heat exchange between the two subsystems when @xmath39 .    because the various terms in the inequality ( [ entropy_product ] ) correspond to different  and putatively independent ",
    "physical processes , one usually adopts a stronger set of separate inequalities , ensuring the non - negativity of each term separately @xcite .",
    "we can ensure the non - negativity of the second term by setting @xmath40 , with a viscosity @xmath41 , which is a standard viscous relation . note that if @xmath42 , deformation that is elastic from the perspective of the c - subsystem ( i.e. one that does not involve configurational changes ) , @xmath43 , will produce dissipation in the k - subsystem due to the action of the viscous / dissipative stress @xmath11 .",
    "the non - negativity of the last term in ( [ entropy_product ] ) can be ensured by a fourier - like relation @xmath44 , with a non - negative heat transfer coefficient @xmath45 . the remaining inequality , @xmath46 , imposes constraints on any rheological constitutive law .",
    "the final step in the thermodynamic analysis is to use eqs .",
    "( [ subsystems_1st_law_c])-([subsystems_1st_law_k ] ) to derive heat equations for the evolution of @xmath35 and @xmath34 . using @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are heat capacities of the c- and k - subsystems respectively ,",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath51 and recall that the second law implies @xmath46 .    equation ( [ heat_k ] ) is an ordinary heat equation with viscous dissipation and heat transfer from the c - subsystem appearing as source terms .",
    "if , as indicated earlier , we include a thermal reservoir as part of the k - subsystem , then we can assume that the heat capacity @xmath50 is indefinitely large , and that @xmath34 is the constant temperature of that reservoir .",
    "otherwise , it is a simple matter to generalize these equations to include heat transfer between the k - subsystem and a separate reservoir at temperature @xmath52 , and thus to describe variations in @xmath34 .    equation ( [ heat_c ] ) is a configurational heat equation for the c - subsystem and is , in fact , an evolution equation for @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath53 is a non - negative source term that tends to enhance glassy disorder due to plastic deformation ( `` rejuvenation '' ) .",
    "the second term on the right - hand - side is typically ( i.e. for @xmath36 ) a sink term that tends to reduce glassy disorder ( `` relaxation '' or `` aging '' ) .",
    "balancing these two terms raises the possibility of reaching a steady state of disorder during persistent flow .",
    "to better understand this , we highlight a special feature of our framework . in standard thermodynamics , coupling coefficients like @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ heat_c])-([heat_k ] ) depend on state variables such as the ordinary temperature @xmath34 . here",
    ", however , the irreversible flow itself can determine the coupling between the subsystems , and @xmath45 may be proportional to the plastic power @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , a steady state @xmath39 naturally emerges , even in the athermal limit , @xmath54 .",
    "this behavior is widely observed @xcite .",
    "our thermodynamic framework culminates with the heat equations ( [ heat_c])-([heat_k ] ) , which is as far as thermodynamics can take us . from this point on , we need to invoke physical considerations relevant to specific physical systems and phenomena of interest .",
    "that is , our thermodynamic framework must be supplemented by rheological constitutive laws .",
    "the hallmark of such constitutive laws is an expression for the plastic rate of deformation @xmath55 . to derive and use such an expression ,",
    "we must choose the internal variables @xmath18 , determine their associated energies and entropies , and derive their evolution laws @xmath56 .",
    "in what follows , we identify several examples of constitutive laws in which the elements of our thermodynamic framework play essential roles .",
    "significant progress in understanding deformation and flow of glassy materials has been made in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "while crystalline solids mainly flow by the propagation of dislocations ( lattice scale topological defects @xcite ) , the lack of long - range translational and orientational order in glassy solids implies the absence of dislocation - mediated crystallographic slip . instead",
    ", glassy flow has been shown to be mediated by stress - driven irreversible rearrangements of localized clusters of deformable elements .",
    "these localized clusters  termed `` flow defects '' or``shear transformation zones '' ( stz s )  are the elementary carriers of inelastic deformation in these systems . this general concept has been the basis for the modern development of various mesoscopic models of glassy rheology @xcite .    an important rheological model of this kind is known as `` soft glassy rheology '' ( sgr ) @xcite . in this model",
    ", a glassy material is described as a collection of mesoscopic elements , each of which is characterized by a local strain @xmath57 and a local energy barrier @xmath58 that must be overcome during rearrangements .",
    "material disorder implies that different elements are characterized by different @xmath57 s and @xmath58 s , and the distribution function @xmath59 plays the role of the @xmath18 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath35 , which is called the `` noise temperature '' in sgr , plays an essential role in activating rearrangements .",
    "this model has been useful in explaining a variety of soft glassy rheological phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been reformulated so as to be largely consistent with the thermodynamic framework outlined here @xcite . in view of the successes of sgr",
    ", it will be important to better understand its relations with other models such as the stz model , which we discuss next .    in the current , thermodynamic version of the stz model ,",
    "shear transformation zones ( stz s ) are dilute , two - state , flow defects that make transitions between their internal orientations in response to external stresses @xcite .",
    "the average rate of these transitions is proportional to the rate of irreversible plastic deformation , @xmath9 .",
    "importantly , stz s have finite lifetimes .",
    "they are continually being created and annihilated by thermal fluctuations and by the mechanical noise generated by the stz transitions themselves .",
    "the total stz density @xmath60 and an orientation tensor @xmath61 constitute the set of internal variables @xmath18 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath60 and @xmath62 is determined by master equations describing both the internal transitions and the annihilations and creations discussed above .",
    "explicit expressions for the entropy @xmath63 and energy @xmath64 are associated with the stz population , and consistency with the second law constraint @xmath46 is enforced .",
    "the steady - state stz density turns out to be proportional to an effective boltzmann factor @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the stz formation energy and @xmath67 is boltzmann s constant , thus providing a direct link between the nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework and the constitutive model @xcite .    the stz model and its variants have been shown to account for a wide range of glassy rheological behaviors , including predictions of stress as a function of strain and strain rate , the appearance of yield stresses at low temperatures , shear banding instabilities and linear viscoelasticity @xcite .",
    "a notable recent example @xcite is the prediction of an annealing - induced brittle - to - ductile transition in metallic glasses ( an important class of new materials @xcite ) .",
    "this calculation uses a space- and time - dependent , tensorial version of the stz constitutive law , combined with equations of motion for the elastic field and the effective temperature @xmath35 in the neighborhood of a crack tip .",
    "realistic system parameters deduced from earlier analyses of spatially uniform deformation are used @xcite .",
    "if the initial @xmath35 is small , the tip sharpens and emits cracks under the influence of an applied stress ; but , if the initial @xmath35 exceeds a critical value , the tip continuously blunts and fracture is significantly delayed @xcite .",
    "these results agree with experiments @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this calculation uses all of the elements of our thermodynamic framework in essential ways  especially the dynamics of @xmath35 , which couples to the deformation rate and guides shape changes near the crack tip . a snapshot of the failure process near the tip of the crack is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    , simulated using the thermodynamic stz model @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature field @xmath68k is plotted , exhibiting strong localization near the notch root , where failure initiates .",
    "see additional details in @xcite.,height=283 ]    two , somewhat different applications of this nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework should be mentioned , at least briefly .",
    "first , we have made an analysis of the kovacs memory effect , in which the volume of a glassy material under constant pressure is measured during a sequence of abrupt temperature changes near the glass transition .",
    "typically , this volume undergoes a sequence of complex , non - exponential , relaxations toward equilibrium , accompanied by marked history dependences . in this case , the relevant internal variables are the populations of vacancies that are created and annihilated in response to the temperature changes @xcite .",
    "second , and even further afield , extensions of the present ideas to the case of dislocation - mediated plasticity in polycrystalline solids , where the areal density of dislocations is the relevant internal variable , have begun to emerge @xcite . an effective temperature @xmath35 plays a central role in both of these applications .",

    "<S> here we highlight a recently developed nonequilibrium thermodynamic framework in which the structural state is characterized by an evolving effective disorder temperature that may differ from the ordinary thermal temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the specific properties of each physical system of interest are described by a small set of coarse - grained internal state variables and their associated energies and entropies . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the internal variables , together with the flow of energy and entropy between the different parts of the driven system , determine continuum - level rheological constitutive laws . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with brief descriptions of several successful applications of this framework . </S>"
