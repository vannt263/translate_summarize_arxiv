    "the lf of cluster galaxies is typically observed to steepen faint - ward of @xmath6 , with power - law slopes @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to the debated upturn of the cluster lf due to an excess of dwarf galaxies relative to the field lf .",
    "the effect may be real , and due to cluster environmental effects , but it could also be generated by systematics in the detection techniques of faint , low surface - brightness galaxies .    in popesso",
    "et al . ( 2004a , hereafter paper ii ) we have recently analyzed the lf of clusters from the rass - sdss ( rosat all sky survey ",
    "sloan digital sky survey ) galaxy clusters survey down to @xmath8 mag .",
    "we concluded that the composite cluster lf is characterized by an upturn and a clear steepening at faint magnitudes , in all sdss photometric bands .",
    "different methods of background subtraction were shown to lead to the same lf .",
    "the observed upturn of the lf at faint magnitudes was shown in particular not to be due to background contamination by large scale structures or multiple clusters along the same line of sight .",
    "we concluded that the observed steepening of the cluster lf is due to the presence of a real population of faint cluster galaxies .",
    "the composite lf was well fitted by the sum of two schechter ( 1976 ) functions .",
    "the lf at its bright - end was shown to be characterized by the classical slope of @xmath9 in all photometric bands , and a decreasing @xmath10 from the @xmath11 to the @xmath12 band .",
    "the lf at its faint - end was found to be much steeper than the lf at its bright - end , and characterized by a power - law slope @xmath13 .",
    "the observed upturn of the lf was found to occur at @xmath14 in the @xmath12 band , and at @xmath15 in the @xmath11 band .",
    "a steep mass function of galactic halos is a robust prediction of currently popular hierarchical clustering theories for the formation and evolution of cosmic structure ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "this prediction conflicts with the flat galaxy lf measured in the field and in local groups , but is in agreement with the steep lf measured in the rass - sdss clusters .",
    "two models have been proposed to explain the observed environmental dependence of the lf . according to menci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , merging processes are responsible for the flattening of the lf ; the environmental dependence arises because mergers are more common in the field ( or group ) environment than in clusters , where they are inhibited by the high velocity dispersion of galaxies .",
    "according to tully et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , instead , the lf flattening is due to inhibited star formation in dark matter halos that form late , i.e. after photoionization of the intergalactic medium has taken place . since dark matter halos form earlier in higher density environments , a dependence of the observed lf slope on the environment is predicted . on the other hand , if reionization happens very early in the universe , this scenario may not work ( davies et al .",
    "other physical processes are however at work in the cluster environment , such as ram - pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) and galaxy harassment ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) , which are able to fade cluster galaxies , particularly the less massive ones . whether the outcome of these processes should be a steepening or a flattening of the lf faint - end is still unclear .    in paper ii it",
    "was also shown that the bright - end of the lf is independent from the cluster environment , and the same in all clusters .",
    "on the other hand , the lf faint - end was found to vary from cluster to cluster . in the present paper ( iv in the series of the rass - sdss galaxy cluster survey )",
    "we show that the previously found variations of the faint end of the cluster lf are due to aperture effects .",
    "in other words , when measured within the physical size of the system , given by either @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the lf is invariant for all clusters , both at the bright and at the faint end .",
    "we also analyze how the number ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies in galaxy clusters depends on global cluster properties such as the velocity dispersion , the mass , and the x - ray and optical luminosities .",
    "finally , we investigate the nature of the dwarf galaxies in clusters by studying their color distribution and suggest a possible formation scenario for this population .",

    "in order to study the variation of the cluster lf from system to system , the analysis has to be applied to a large statistical sample of clusters , covering the whole spectrum of properties ( in mass , richness , x - ray luminosity and optical luminosity ) of the systems considered . since the x - ray observations provide a robust method of identification of galaxy clusters and the x - ray luminosity is a good estimator of the system total mass and optical luminosity ( see paper i and popesso et al .",

    "we do not observe blue galaxies within @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , the central late - type lf at @xmath179 is flatter than the lfs in the outer regions and shows a fainter @xmath10 . since red galaxies are mostly high surface - brightness objects ( blanton et al .",
    "2004 ) , the surface brightness selection effect should be more important for the late - type lf , which , once corrected , would become steeper at the faint - end .",
    "if anything , the difference in slope between the faint - ends of the early- and late - type lfs should thus be even larger than observed .",
    "these results are confirmed by the analysis of the early - type lfs in independent clustercentric rings .",
    "we consider the region at distances @xmath185 ( the central ring ) , @xmath186 ( the intermediate ring ) and @xmath187 ( the outer ring ) .",
    "the best fitting functions of the cluster early - type lfs within these regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ gradiente ] . in order to emphasize the _ shape _ variation of the lf , all three lfs are renormalized to the same value .",
    "the upturn at the faint end is brighter in the outer ring than in the central one , confirming the previous analysis .",
    "moreover , the shape of the bright end of the cluster lf seems to be absolutely independent from the faint end .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and the slope of the bright end are consistent within the errors in the three regions ( as found in paper ii ) .",
    "this suggests that the process of formation of the bright cluster galaxies ( with magnitude brighter that @xmath188 mag ) is the same in all the cluster environments .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the lack of dwarf systems observed at the center of the cluster is due to a hierarchical process of formation of the bright central galaxies .",
    "indeed , in that case we should observe also a lack of bright galaxies in the outer ring in favor of large amount of dwarf systems , which is not observed .",
    "the analysis so far provides only results about the lf _ shape . _ in order to quantify the relative contribution of the early- and late - type dwarf galaxy populations to the faint end of the lf , and its dependence on the environment , we analyse the radial ( cumulative and differential ) profile of the dwarf systems in the clusters . for this",

    "the center ( @xmath190 ) contains less than 30% of dwarf galaxies ( half of them are red systems ) , in the selected magnitude range .",
    "dwarf galaxies are more abundant in the cluster outskirts ; the high - density environment in the cluster cores is hostile to dwarf galaxies .",
    "this phenomenology has already been observed in several individual clusters ( see e.g. lobo et al .",
    "1997 ; boyce et al . 2001 ; mercurio et al . 2003 ; dahlen et al .",
    "2004 ) ;    the early - type dwarf galaxies represents 35% of the whole dwarf population within @xmath0 , i.e. most of the dwarf galaxies are of late - type .",
    "however , the dwarf early - type galaxies are the dominant dwarf population region within @xmath191 , their relative fraction reaching a plateau at @xmath192 , while the late - type dwarf galaxies are more abundant in clusters outskirts .",
    "this is confirmed also by the ratio between early- and late - type dwarf galaxies calculated in contiguous clustercentric rings ( differential profile , see fig .  [",

    "the number of early - type dwarf galaxies is twice the number of late - type dwarf galaxies within @xmath179 and then decreases to 1/2 at larger distances .",

    "[ profile]@xmath193 we show the ratio between early- and late - type dwarf galaxies as a function of the number density of galaxies brighter than @xmath194 ( the bright galaxies number density profile is shown in panel @xmath46 of the same figure ) .",
    "as expected , the early - type dwarf galaxies dominate in high density regions , while the late - type dwarf galaxies are frequent in low density regions .",
    "clearly , the well known morphology density relation for cluster galaxies ( dressler 1980 ) has an extension into the dwarf regime .      in order to extend the morphology - density relation for dwarf cluster galaxies outside clusters , we extract a subsample of galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "we select a fairly complete sample of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath195 and in the magnitude range @xmath196 .",
    "the late - type galaxies ( @xmath197 ) represent the 93% of the galactic population in that range of magnitude , in agreement with the results of blanton et al .",
    "we then calculate for each galaxy in the sample the local density of galaxy neighbors , by counting the number of systems with @xmath194 mag , within 2.5 mpc projected radius and @xmath198 km / s of the galaxy position and redshift .",
    "we divide the subsample in late and early - type galaxies using the color cut of strateva et al .",
    "[ n_dist ] shows the number of galaxies per bin of local density for the two galaxy types .",
    "it is clear that late - type galaxies ( dashed dotted histogram ) populate the very low density regions , while the early - type galaxies distribution ( solid histogram ) has a much larger spread , with 50% of the systems located in regions with more than 10 galaxy neighbors .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our composite cluster lfs with the lf of field galaxies .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently derived the lf of field sdss galaxies down to @xmath199 mag .",
    "their lf have a very weak upturn , much shallower and at a fainter carachteristic magnitude than in our cluster lf .",
    "the faint - end slope of their lf is @xmath200 , but could be steeper ( @xmath201 ) if a correction is applied to account for low surface - brightness selection effects .",
    "the lf of _ blue _ field galaxies is even steeper , but the authors do not report the value of the faint - end slope .",
    "a similar faint - end slope ( @xmath201 ) has also been found by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the lf of field galaxies from the 2df survey .",
    "they also noticed an upturn in the lf , due to an overabundance of early - type galaxies , making it impossible to fit the lf adequately with a single schechter function .",
    "a previous determination of the sdss field lf was obtained by nakamura et al .",
    "they found a slope of @xmath202 for dirr , consistent with the value found by marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the cfa survey .",
    "the faint - end slope of our late - type cluster galaxies lf is steeper than most field lfs for the same galaxy type ( see table  3 in paper ii ) but consistent with those of nakamura et al . (",
    "2003 ) and marzke et al .",
    "given the large variance of results for the field lfs , possibly due to the different magnitude limits adopted , or to poor statistics in the fainter bins of the lf ( see de lapparent 2003 for a thorough discussion on this topic ) , we conclude there is no significant difference between the late - type lf in clusters and the field .",
    "there are many observations and theoretical models in the literature that try to explain the formation and evolution of cluster galaxies , red dwarf galaxies in particular . according to the hierarchical picture for structure formation , small dark matter haloes form before large ones .",
    "if one identifies the dwarf galaxies with the small dark matter haloes , they are predicted to origin soon after the structure formation began .",
    "dwarf ellipticals would then be old , passively evolved galaxies .",
    "this scenario seems to be inconsistent with the observations of a large spread in age and metallicity in the clusters dwarf early - type galaxies ( conselice et al . 2001,2003 ; rakos et al .",
    "hence , dwarf ellipticals must have had a delayed star formation epoch .",
    "the delay could be originated by the intense ultraviolet background intensity at high redshift , keeping the gas of the dwarf galaxies photoionized until @xmath203 , or , perhaps by the intra - cluster medium confinement .",
    "the intra - cluster medium pressure could avoid dwarf galaxies losing their gas content by sn ejecta .",
    "however , this possibility would require a much more centrally concentrated distribution of dwarf ellipticals in clusters than is observed .    in alternative ,",
    "the excess of dwarf early - type galaxies in clusters could origin from the evolution of field dirr when they are accreted by the clusters .",
    "the evolution of dirr into dwarf early - type galaxies is supported by the result of van zee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , namely that there is significant similarity in the scaling relations and properties of dirr and des .",
    "a scenario where _ all _ dwarf early - type galaxies evolve from dirr via disk fading does not however seem possible , because many des in the virgo and fornax clusters are brighter than the dirr ( conselice et al .",
    "2001 ) .    perhaps , some dwarf early - type galaxies evolve from dirr and some evolve from spirals",
    ". the evolution of spirals into dwarf spheroidals can occur via the process of galaxy harassment proposed by moore et al .",
    "( 1996,1998 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "close , rapid encounters between galaxies can lead to a radical transformation of a galaxy morphology .",
    "gas and stars are progressively stripped out of the disk systems , eventually leaving a spheroidal remnant , that resembles an s0 galaxy or a dwarf spheroidal , depending on the size of the progenitor .",
    "direct support for the harassment scenario comes from the discoveries of disks or even spiral arms in dwarf early - type cluster galaxies ( jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ; barazza et al .",
    "2002 ; graham et al .",
    "indirect support comes from the similar velocity distribution of dwarf cluster galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2001 ) and gas - rich spirals and irregulars ( biviano et al . 1997 ) , both suggesting infalling orbits .",
    "is the harassment scenario still viable in view of our results ?",
    "we can draw the following conclusions from our observational results .",
    "first , the universality of the cluster lf suggests that whatever shapes the cluster lf is not strictly dependent on the cluster properties .",
    "second , the difference between the cluster and field lf seems to be related to an excess of dwarf early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "hence , there is a cluster - related process that leads to the formation of dwarf early - type galaxies , regardless of the cluster intrinsic properties .",
    "the process can not be related , e.g. , to the intra - cluster gas density , or the cluster velocity dispersion , or the cluster mass , hence , a process like ram - pressure would seem to be ruled out .",
    "the density dependence of the relative number of early- and late - type dwarfs suggests that the shaping of the cluster lf is related to the excess mean density relative to the field , which is the same for all clusters if , as we have done , the cluster regions are defined within a fixed overdensity radius ( @xmath0 in our case ) . in other words , the transformation of spirals , and perhaps , dirr , into dwarf spheroidals or des , seems to be a threshold process that occurs when the local density exceeds a given threshold .",
    "judging from fig .",
    "[ profile ] , this threshold seems to occur at a clustercentric distance of @xmath2040.7 @xmath0 .",
    "we have also found that the relative number of dwarf early- and late - type galaxies increases with decreasing clustercentric distance ( and increasing density ) .",
    "galaxies near the cluster center are probably an older cluster population , accreted when the cluster was smaller , according to the hierarchical picture of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "hence , these centrally located galaxies have had more time to accomplish the morphology transformation than galaxies located in the cluster outskirts , which are more recent arrivals .",
    "on the other hand , very near the cluster center , an additional process must be at work to explain our observed fading of the upturn of the cluster early - type lf , and the decrease of both the early- and the late - type dwarf - to - giant galaxy ratio with decreasing clustercentric distance .",
    "high - velocity dispersions in clusters inhibit merging processes ( e.g. mihos 2004 ) , hence it is unlikely that dwarf galaxies merge to produce bigger galaxies at the cluster centers .",
    "consistently , we find that the shape of the bright - end of the early - type lf does not depend on the environment , which suggests that bright early - type galaxies are not a recent product of the cluster environment . in fact",
    ", the luminosity density profile of bright early - type galaxies has not evolved significantly since redshift @xmath205 ( ellingson 2003 ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for the lack of dwarf galaxies near the cluster center is tidal or collisional disruption of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "the fate of the disrupted dwarfs is probably to contribute to the intra - cluster diffuse light ( e.g. feldmeier et al .",
    "2004 ; murante et al .",
    "2004 ; willman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the difference between the cluster and field lf could thus be explained as a difference in morphological mix , plus a density - dependent dwarf early - type galaxies lf , that , added to an invariant bright early - type lf , produces a more or less important and bright upturn , depending on the density of the environment .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the cluster individual and composite luminosity functions down to @xmath8 mag in all the sloan photometric bands .",
    "all the luminosity functions are calculated within the physical size of the systems given by @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the main conclusions of our analysis are as follows :    * we confirm that the composite lf shows a bimodal behavior with a marked upturn at the faint magnitude range .",
    "a double schechter component function is the best fit for the cluster lf .",
    "we show that calculating the individual and the composite lf within a fixed aperture for all the systems introduces selection effects .",
    "these selection effects justify the differences observed in the faint end of the individual cluster lfs studied in paper ii and the anti - correlations between dgr and the global cluster properties ( mass , velocity dispersion , optical and x - ray luminosities ) observed in this work .",
    "if the cluster lf is calculated within the physical size of the system ( @xmath1 or @xmath0 ) , the differences due to aperture effects disappear and the individual cluster lf is well represented by the composite lf .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the shape of the cluster lf is universal in all the magnitude ranges .",
    "* we use the @xmath2 color to study the color distribution of the faint cluster galaxies .",
    "the color distribution confirms that the contamination due to background galaxies is due to field - to - field variance of the background .",
    "we apply the color cut at @xmath154 suggested by strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to separate early - type from late - type galaxies and study the composite lf by morphological type .",
    "we observe that the upturn at the faint magnitudes shown by the complete lf is due to early - type galaxies while the late - type lf is well represented by a single schechter function .",
    "* we study the cumulative and the differential radial profile of the faint early- and late - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "the faint early - type galaxies are concentrated in the central regions while the faint late - type galaxies dominate the outskirts of the systems .",
    "the analysis of the color - density relation in a reference sample of nearby galaxies selected from the sdss spectroscopic sample suggests that red galaxies could be a typical cluster galaxy population .",
    "our analysis show that the bright red population seems to have a luminosity distribution absolutely independent from the behavior of the faint red galaxies in different environments .",
    "we observe a fading of the lf upturn toward the cluster core .",
    "* we propose to interpret our results in term of a combination of two processes , transformation of spirals and dirr into dwarf early - type galaxies via harassment , and disruption of dwarf galaxies near the cluster center by collisions and/or tidal effects .",
    "whether galaxies evolve from one type to another , in response to the local density , to create the morphology - density relation , or whether the relation is established when the galaxies form , is still an open issue ( see , e.g. , dressler 2004 ) .",
    "photometric data alone can not provide conclusive indications about the nature and the origin of the dwarf population in cluster . in this respect , it would be very useful to sample the velocity distributions of a large set of dwarf galaxies in clusters , in order to constrain their orbital characteristics as it has recently been done for bright cluster galaxies ( biviano & katgert 2004 ) . if the dwarf early - type galaxies evolve from spirals , radially elongated orbits",
    "are expected , while if dwarf early - type galaxies are a more pristine cluster population , their orbits should resemble the isotropic orbits of ellipticals .",
    "additional insights may come from higher accuracy spectroscopy of the dwarf galaxies , allowing to deduce information about their internal velocity dispersion and metallicity , which could be used to put constraints on their age ( see , e.g. , kauffmann et al .",

    "<S> we analyze the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of a subsample of 69 clusters from the rass - sdss galaxy cluster catalog . </S>",
    "<S> when calculated within the cluster physical sizes , given by @xmath0 or @xmath1 , all the cluster lfs appear to have the same shape , well fitted by a composite of two schechter functions with a marked upturn and a steepening at the faint - end . </S>",
    "<S> previously reported cluster - to - cluster variations of the lf faint - end slope are due to the use of a metric cluster aperture for computing the lf of clusters of different masses .    </S>",
    "<S> we determine the composite lf for early- and late - type galaxies , where the typing is based on the galaxy @xmath2 colors . </S>",
    "<S> the late - type lf is well fitted by a single schechter function with a steep slope ( @xmath3 in the @xmath4 band , within @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the early - type lf instead can not be fitted by a single schechter function , and a composite of two schechter functions is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the faint - end upturn of the global cluster lf is due to the early - type cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the bright - end tail of the early - type lf does not seem to depend upon the local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> the late - type lf shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the faint - end tail of the early - type lf shows a significant and continuous variation with the environment .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide evidence that the process responsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies in clusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds @xmath5 times the critical density of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> we interpret our results in the context of the harassment scenario , where faint early - type cluster galaxies are predicted to be the descendants of tidally - stripped late - type galaxies . </S>"
