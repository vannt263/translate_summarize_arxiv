    "the most successful theories of structure formation assume that small initial fluctuations grew by gravitational amplification in an expanding cosmological background .",
    "this simple assumption has been remarkably successful in explaining non - linear structures in simulations and observations , especially on larger scales .",
    "the basic equation governing the statistics of the dark matter field is the collisionless boltzman s ( or vlasov ) equation .",
    "these non - linear equations are considered to be intractable , therefore the most usual approach is to take their moments .",
    "taking only the first few moments of the equation results in euler s ideal ( pressureless ) fluid equations coupled with the poisson equation for gravity .",
    "the fluid approximation , however , breaks down at shell crossing .",
    "arbitrarily high moments yield an infinite hierarchy of equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bbkgy equations .",
    "these relate time evolution of @xmath9-th order moments to @xmath10-th order moments .",
    "the equations can be `` closed '' only under certain assumptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation of motions in langrangian space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are as successful as the eulerian method .",
    "the above analytical tools are checked by a set of numerical and semi - numerical methods , such as @xmath9-body simulations , and approximations thereof such as zeldovich , truncated zeldovich , frozen flow , adhesion approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one particularly successful method to solve the above equations before shell crossing is perturbation theory ( pt ) ; eulerian ( ept ) and langrangian ( lpt ) perturbation theories are used with similar success .",
    "contributions can be ordered systematically , represented and enumerated by the use of feynman graphs pioneered by @xcite the first non - trivial order , tree level pt penetrates the non - linear regime to surprisingly high degree .",
    "cumulants of the dark matter density field have been calculated for gaussian initial conditions by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance the skewness @xmath11 of mildly nonlinear field is @xmath12 where in is the local power index of the power spectrum .",
    "similar calculations have been performed for the full three - point correlation function and bispectrum @xcite .",
    "the theory have been confirmed by simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and data appear to be in broad agreement as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the most straightforward way to improve tree - level pt is to include the next to leading order , `` loop '' corrections .",
    "such calculations @xcite , albeit fairly complicated , do improve the agreement with simulations on small scales .",
    "another extension to pt is the spherical infall model , in which one calculates angle averaged feynman vertices @xcite .",
    "it is a fairly simple alternative to the tedious calculation of loop corrections , but it yields only a fraction of the corrections due to neglecting tidal effects . besides physical theories , several phenomenological assumptions exist to fit smaller scale behavior ( e.g. ,  extended  and  hyperextended ",
    "pt , see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "in this paper we propose an entirely different approach based on the correspondence limit of the schrdinger equations .",
    "these are equivalent to the full boltzman - vlasov description @xcite , but involve a complex scalar field depending on 3 + 1 variables , similarly to the euler equations . as shown below , perturbation theory of the shrdiger theory ( spt ) is not significantly more complicated then ept . the next section presents the underlying theory , section 3 outlines the connection with conventional pt , section 4 deals with the cumulants in more detail , finally the last section discusses the results and provides an outlook for research possible using this formalism .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the correspondence limit is a viable alternative to the collisionless boltzman s ( vlasov ) equations . in the expanding universe ( with @xmath13 for simplicity )",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complex scalar field representing dark matter density with @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the hubble s constant and @xmath18 is the hamiltonian of the gravitational field .",
    "this is a nonlinear equation , since @xmath18 depends on the density field .",
    "if new variables are introduced as    @xmath19    the above equation reduces to equations for two real scalar fields @xmath20",
    "\\cr    \\dot b & = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}[\\nabla^2a + { \\mid{\\nabla a}\\mid}^2 ]              -\\frac{1}{2ma^2}{\\mid{\\nabla b}\\mid}^2 - mv\\cr    & \\nabla^2v = 4\\pi g\\bar\\rho a^2(a^{2a}-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equation is the poisson equation coupled to the schrdinger equation . the structure of these equations is similar to the euler s fluid equations in terms of the density contrast and velocity potential , despite the fact that we have not taken moments of the underlying full equations .",
    "the main difference , and extra complication arises from the exponential in the poisson equation . perturbation theory of these equations will be entirely analogous to that of the euler equations , and it can be presented in fourier space in the simplest manner .    in what follows we will work in the correspondence limit , i.e. @xmath21 , we neglect `` wavy '' features of the equations .",
    "fourier transforming the equations yields @xmath22 \\cr    \\dot b_k & = -\\frac{1}{2a^2}(k b_k)(k b_k ) - \\frac{3h^2}{2k^2 }    \\sum_{n \\ge 1 } \\frac{2^n}{n ! } a_k^n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the multiple and power of transforms are understood as convolutions , @xmath23 is assumed for simplicity , the poisson equation was substituted for @xmath24 , and the exponential expanded .    these equations can be rendered homogeneous in @xmath25 and @xmath17 using the following anstze @xmath26 perturbations can be ordered according to powers of the growth factor .",
    "we can introduce the usual kernels with the following definition @xmath27 substituting to the equations leads to the following recursions @xmath28 where mode coupling functions are similar to the eulerian case @xmath29 and the exponential is expanded ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 correspond to the sum of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and all the wave vectors . to solve the recursion at any order",
    ", one has to separate @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in the expansion of the exponential and subtract the two equations from each other .",
    "this procedure leads to terms up to @xmath37 on the right hand side of the equations . here",
    "we give explicitly @xmath38 case @xmath39 higher order kernel functions can be obtained trivially from the recursion relation .",
    "these kernels can be used to calculate quantities to the accuracy of tree level perturbation theory . in what follows",
    "we will show the connection with eulerian perturbation theory via explicitly calculating tree level quantities at third order ..",
    "since @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the perturbative corrections to @xmath1 growing with the first and second power of the growth factor are @xmath43 thus @xmath44 to tree level perturbation theory is @xmath45\\cr     & = 3a^4 8 \\int{d^3k_1\\ldots d^3k_4}(1+f^2(k_2,k_3))a_{k_1}^{(1)}\\ldots      a_{k_4}^{(1 ) } e^{ix\\sum k_i}\\cr     & = \\frac{3}{2}a^4 \\int{d^3k_1\\ldots d^3k_4}(1+f^2(k_2,k_3 ) )     \\delta^{(1)}_{k_1}\\ldots \\delta^{(1)}_{k_4 } e^{ix\\sum k_i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when taking the ensemble average ( assuming gaussian fields ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can not be paired , yielding a combinatorial factor of 2 . from this @xmath48 , where @xmath49 here means angle averaging . since @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 as expected from pt .",
    "in fact it is easy to show @xmath53 ( after the necessary symmetrization of the kernels ) , where @xmath54 is the second order kernel ( naked vertex ) in ept .",
    "thus calculations entirely analogous to the above show that tree - level bispectrum , 3-pt function , and the skewness after smoothing , cumulant correlators , etc .",
    "are all exactly matching the tree - level ept results .",
    "to derive cumulants one has to consider the angle averaged recursion relations .",
    "if the angle averaged kernels are defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the first equation gives a very simple relation : @xmath57 from this the second equation gives a simple recursion for @xmath58 which reads @xmath59.\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath60 , one can solve to arbitrary order in a trivial fashion .",
    "the first two naked vertices are @xmath61 from these the tree level cumulants of the @xmath62 field can be calculated as @xmath63    projecting the cumulants of the @xmath62 field using the formalism of biasing recovers cumulants of @xmath1 .. in this context the primary field is @xmath62 and @xmath64 is a non - linearly biased field , where the usual bias coefficients read @xmath65 and @xmath66 . according to the formula of @xcite , @xmath67 i.e. we recover the results of tree level pt exactly .    because of the non - linear transformation , tree level calculations of the @xmath62 field translate into ( possibly incomplete ) loop corrections for the @xmath1 field . to demonstrate this we calculate the loop corrections arising from the tree - level spt for the variance @xmath68 . according to @xcite the variance @xmath69 .",
    "initially , there is no skewness , thus for the initial conditions , the linear variance @xmath70 follows the same equation with @xmath71 . expanding and collecting terms to second order in @xmath72 yields @xmath73",
    "numerically the coefficient is @xmath74 is within @xmath75 of the exact loop correction @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the dominant part of the loop correction arises from tree level perturbations of the logarithm of the field .",
    "the same expansion can be generalized to any order , although tedious , fairly simple .",
    "it will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we have used the general theory of @xcite , however , exponential bias was explicitly treated by @xcite ; their results will probably be useful for future calculations of this sort .",
    "note that the above calculations are for the unsmoothed field , or @xmath76 .",
    "detailed calculation for other spectral indices will be shown elsewhere ; as a preview , simple considerations suggest @xmath77 , and consequently @xmath2 for @xmath78 in excellent agreement with pt .",
    "we have introduced spt based on on the schrdinger equations . in the correspondence limit ,",
    "our description is equivalent with the full boltzman ( vlasov ) equations .",
    "other versions of pt , in particular ept , explicitly break down at shell crossing , therefore our ultimate aim is to penetrate the non - linear regime deeper .    a unique feature of spt that it is naturally uses the logarithm of the dark matter field , which remains close to gaussian throughout the non - linear evolution .",
    "this suggests that the spt expansion should converge faster .",
    "related techniques such as edgeworth expansion , etc . are expected to be more accurate .",
    "indeed , we have shown that , at least for the variance , this is the case .",
    "this feature of our theory sheds new light on the validity of the lognormal prescription for @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and suggests using @xmath62 , i.e. the logarithm of the underlying dark matter field to construct statistics , such as correlation function , skewness , kurtosis , bispectrum , ( in @xmath62-space ) . the first encouraging steps towards analyzing data in log - space have been done by @xcite .",
    "our principal aim here is to present the basic theory , and the calculation of the recursions for the tree level perturbation theory kernels .",
    "these constitute the ground work for a spectrum of future research .",
    "we have also given the recursion for the angle averaged kernels and elaborated the results up to @xmath0 explicitly .",
    "higher orders are calculated trivially from the results shown .",
    "we have explored the connection of our theory with ept .",
    "we have recovered the first non - trivial tree level pt kernel in the appropriate limit .",
    "all third order tree level pt results ( e.g. , bispectrum , three - point function ) are exactly reproduced by the spt expansion .",
    "in addition , we have applied the exponential bias formalism to recover exactly the tree level pt cumulants up to @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical exercise of proving the equivalence to arbitrary order is left for subsequent research .",
    "our tree level results correspond to ( possibly incomplete ) infinite order loop corrections . to demonstrate that , we have obtained the first non - trivial loop correction for the variance by simply expanding our tree level results to second order .",
    "the agreement of this simple expansion with the complex ept loop calculations is remarkable .",
    "a large , perhaps dominant , fraction of the loop corrections arises from the non - linear projection of tree level results from @xmath62-space to @xmath1-space .",
    "the following extensions and generalizations will be presented in subsequent publications : detailed exploration of the higher order cumulants , cumulant correlators , @xmath9-point correlation functions and @xmath37-spectra , and the probability distribution function ; other statistics , such as genus and void probability ; smoothing ; non - gaussian initial conditions ; application to angular correlations and lensing ; general cosmological background ; approximate loop and non - perturbative corrections for higher order quantities using our non - linear projection ; exact loop corrections in @xmath62-space ; comparison of tree - level statistics of the @xmath62-field , such as bispectrum , three - point correlation function , and cumulants ( variance , skewness , and kurtosis ) , with simulations .",
    "other interesting applications of the theory are possible , such as studying the wavy term which was neglected so far ( and thus modeling a dark matter with large compton wavelength ) . a fast approximation scheme similar to 2lpt will be obtained and implemented from our formalism , possibly including wavy terms .",
    "note that we have not mentioned the interpretation of the @xmath79 field ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "initially , this corresponds to the usual velocity potential ; the interpretation after shell crossing is unclear .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations yield @xmath80 and @xmath81 as well ; the connection with measurements is left for future work .",
    "the method we have put forward follows almost exactly the prescription of ept for a slightly different set of equations .",
    "these is not that only way to deal with these equations ; other possibilities exist , such as using the interaction picture analogously to quantum mechanics . as a first step towards this direction , the authors have shown that the zeldovich approximation is recovered in the 0-th order approximation .",
    "this in turn ( along with the logarithmic mapping ) hints a connection with langrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) , which will be explored later .    is was supported by nasa through aisr grants nag5 - 10750 , nag5 - 11996 , and atp grant nasa",
    "nag5 - 12101 as well as by nsf grants ast02 - 06243 and phy99 - 07949 ; the latter while enjoying the hospitality of kitp .",
