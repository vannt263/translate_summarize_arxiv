    "the main goal of modern cosmology is to build a cosmological model that is consistent with astronomical observations . to achieve this goal ,",
    "tremendous efforts have been made both on theories and on observations since the general theory of relativity was developed .",
    "so far the most successful model of the universe is the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) world model @xcite .",
    "the frw world model predicts reasonably well the current observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and the large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "the precisely determined cosmological parameters of the frw world model imply that our universe is consistent with the spatially flat world model dominated by dark energy and cold dark matter ( @xmath1 ) with adiabatic initial condition driven by inflation @xcite .",
    "although the flat frw world model is currently the most reliable physical world model , one may have the following fundamental questions on the nature of the frw world model .",
    "first , mathematically , if a space - time manifold is flat , then the riemann curvature tensor should vanish , and vice versa .",
    "however , the riemann curvature tensor of the flat frw world model does not vanish unless the cosmic expansion speed and acceleration are zeros , which implies that the physical space - time of the flat frw world is not geometrically flat but curved .",
    "only its spatial section at a constant time is flat .",
    "secondly , the cosmic evolution equations of the frw world model can be derived from an application of the newton s gravitation and the local energy conservation laws to the dynamical motion of an expanding sphere with finite mass density @xcite . besides , the newton s",
    "gravitation theory has been widely used to mimic the non - linear clustering of large - scale structures in the universe even on the horizon - sized @xmath2-body simulations @xcite .",
    "on large scales , the close connection between the frw world model and the newton s gravitation law is usually attributed to the fact that the linear evolution of large - scale density perturbations satisfies the weak gravitational field condition .",
    "recently , hwang and noh @xcite show that the relativistic fluid equations perturbed to second order in a flat frw background world coincide exactly with the newtonian results , and prove that the newtonian numerical simulation is valid in all cosmological scales up to the second order .",
    "however , one may have a different point of view that the newton s gravitational action at a distance appears to be valid even on the super - horizon scales in the frw world just because the world model does not reflect the full nature of the relativistic theory of gravitation .",
    "thirdly , according to the frw world model , the universe at sufficiently early epoch ( @xmath3 ) is usually regarded as flat since the curvature parameter contributes negligibly to the total density .",
    "the present non - flat universe should have had the density parameter approaching to @xmath4 with infinitely high precision just after the big - bang ( flatness problem ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we imagine the surface of an expanding balloon with positive curvature , then the curvature of the surface is always positive and becomes even higher as the balloon is traced back to the earlier epoch when it was smaller .",
    "this prediction from the common sense contradicts the frw world model .",
    "observationally , the flat @xmath1 universe is favored by the recent joint cosmological parameter estimation using the wilkinson microwave anisotropy ( wmap ) cmb @xcite , large - scale structures @xcite , type ia supernovae ( snia ; @xcite ) , hubble constant @xcite , baryonic oscillation data @xcite , and so on . however , the wmap cmb data alone is more compatible with the non - flat frw world model ( @xmath5 of @xcite and table iii of @xcite ) .",
    "besides , some parameter estimations using snia data or angular size - redshift data of distant radio sources alone suggest a possibility of the closed universe @xcite .",
    "the combinations of the wmap plus the snia data or the hubble constant data also imply the possibility of the closed universe , giving curvature parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively @xcite , although the estimated values are still consistent with the flat frw world model .    the questions above and the observational constraints on the cosmological model may bring about possibilities of non - flat or non - frw world models .",
    "interestingly , einstein claimed that our universe is spatially bounded or closed @xcite .",
    "the primary reason for his preference to the closed universe is because mach s idea @xcite that the inertia depends upon the mutual action of bodies is compatible only with the finite universe , not with a quasi - euclidean , infinite universe .",
    "according to einstein s argument , an infinite universe is possible only if the mean density of matter in the universe vanishes , which is unlikely due to the fact that there is a positive mean density of matter in the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the general world model for homogeneous and isotropic universe which supports einstein s perspective on the physical universe .",

    "the starting point for constructing a physical world model is to define the space - time separation between two neighboring events , i.e. , the line element @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the metric tensor which determines all the geometric properties of space - time in a system of coordinates . in ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) ,",
    "the two events are generally distinct in space and time , separated by @xmath32 . in the special theory of relativity , a separation between two distinct events is given by @xmath33 which is invariant in all inertial reference frames .",

    "the early development in modern cosmology was focused on finding the metric appropriate for the real universe whose space - time structure is inconsistent with the minkowski metric due to the expansion of the universe and the presence of matter in it . as a pioneer ,",
    "einstein @xcite developed a model of the static closed universe that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic , by adopting a metric with @xmath35 and @xmath36 from the static condition .",
    "friedmann @xcite developed a more general world model that includes both stationary and non - stationary universes of positive spatial curvature , by assuming that one can make @xmath35 and @xmath36 by an appropriate choice of time coordinate .",
    "weyl @xcite postulated that in a cosmological model the world lines of particles ( e.g. , galaxies ) form a @xmath37-bundle of nonintersecting geodesics orthogonal to a series of space - like hypersurfaces , which implies that @xmath38 depends on @xmath39 only and @xmath36 .",
    "robertson @xcite also argued that the line element may be expressed as @xmath40 for a universe where the matter has on the whole the time - like geodesics @xmath41 as world lines , and the coordinate @xmath42 can be interpreted as a mean time which serves to define proper time and simultaneity for the entire universe .",

    "the temporal separation @xmath58 is measured for events at different time epochs .",
    "in other words , spatial and temporal distances are related to two different couples of events , in contradiction to the general definition of the line element ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) in which only a couple of events should be involved .",
    "besides , in the frw metric the geometry of physical space separates into the geometry of comoving space and the expansion history @xmath47 .",
    "this is the reason why the flat frw world model is geometrically flat only in the comoving space , not in the physical space and time .",
    "therefore , the effect of cosmic expansion on the space - time geometry has not been correctly reflected in the frw metric , giving an inaccurate measure of distance between events .    to derive the general form of line element for homogeneous and isotropic universe ,",
    "let us introduce a @xmath59 minkowski space - time composed of 4-dimensional euclidean space and 1-dimensional time , and assume that our universe is spatially a 3-dimensional hypersurface with uniform curvature embedded in the 4-dimensional space .",
    "in fact , the hypersurface with negative curvature ( open space ) can not be embedded in the euclidean space . here",

    ". distances between events on the universe will be measured based on this fiducial system .",
    "although the world reference frame has been introduced for mathematical convenience , it is useful in that the space - time coordinates of the frame are independent of the dynamics of the universe . as will be shown later",
    ", the proper time as measured by an observer in the universe does not elapse uniformly , being affected by the cosmic expansion .",
    "thus , it is natural to use the world time coordinate with uniform lapse for a fair comparison of physical phenomena in the expanding universe .",
    "the space coordinates of the world reference frame can be conveniently used to describe the geometry of a 3-dimensional hypersurface embedded in the 4-dimensional euclidean space ( see sec .",

    "it is clear that the expansion of space affects both space and time intervals in the line element , which is the main difference from the frw metric .",
    "generally , the line element ( metric ) should reflect the fact that the cosmic expansion is a dynamical phenomenon .",
    "eq . ( [ eq : lineflat ] ) implies that the frw line element for the 1-dimensional flat space is valid only at a local region around an observer at @xmath86 .",
    "the frw line element for the closed space also has a similar form to the flat case , i.e. , @xmath87 , where , to be consistent with ( [ eq : lineclosed ] ) , @xmath88 should be interpreted as a proper time interval measured by a local observer ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "to such an observer who may be located between events @xmath69 and @xmath90 ( or between events @xmath91 and @xmath70 after @xmath63 ) , the spatial separation between neighboring events appears to be @xmath92 [ e.g. , the arc length between events 1 and 2 in fig .",

    "the large - scale uniformity of the cmb anisotropy suggests that the observed regions must have been in causal contact in the past .",
    "the inflation paradigm has offered a reasonable solution to the puzzle of the large - scale homogeneity of the observable universe by proposing that there was a period of rapid expansion of the universe with positive acceleration @xcite . according to the inflation theory",

    "[ fig : horizon ] compares proper ( top ) and comoving ( bottom ) horizon sizes as a function of world time .",
    "it is important to note that comoving horizon sizes were zeros at the beginning of the universe , and then have increased until the recent epoch . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : evhist ] , the universe was expanding with the limiting speed and zero acceleration at the initial time ( figs .",
    "[ fig : adotplot ] and [ fig : accplot ] ) .",
    "therefore , the positive expansion acceleration or the decrease in the comoving hubble radius is not allowable at the early stage of the closed universe .",
    "the decrease is only possible in later @xmath20-dominated universe ( @xmath577 gyr ; fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] , bottom ) .    actually , the scalar field @xmath130 is not essential for driving the rapid expansion of the universe . even if the scalar field is dominant , the condition ( [ eq : inf_cond ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "we can only expect that @xmath578 from the constraint of zero acceleration , obtaining an equation of state @xmath579 thus the curvature radius increases as @xmath580 in the universe dominated by the scalar field . further constraining the universe to expand with the limiting speed demands that the energy density of the scalar field should be infinite , as in the extreme case of h - universe ( sec .",
    "[ sec : evhist ] ) .",
    "however , the radiation - universe with finite total energy provides a far simpler expansion history @xmath581 for @xmath582 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : rde ] ) ] , which demonstrates the sufficiency of the radiation in driving the rapid expansion and the needlessness of the scalar field . in conclusion , it is improbable that the inflation with positive acceleration occurred in the early universe .",
    "if the universe expands with the limiting speed , the peculiar velocity of a particle vanishes as implied by ( [ eq : dtau ] ) : the matter and radiation were frozen with zero propagation speed at the earliest epoch . besides , information at one region could not be easily transferred to other regions due to the small horizon size .",
    "thus , physical information sharing through the causal contact during the expansion of the universe is not an efficient way to explain for the large - scale homogeneity of the universe .",
    "the spherically symmetric and uniform distribution of supernova remnants ( e.g. , tycho s supernova 1572 ; @xcite ) driven by a strong shock into the ambient interstellar medium shows that the large - scale homogeneity can be generated from the ballistic explosion at the single point , without the causal contact during the expansion . at the beginning of the universe ,",
    "everything was on the single point so that every information such as temperature and energy density could be shared in full and uniform contact .",
    "therefore , if the initial condition was properly set at the creation of the universe , e.g. , by the quantum processes at @xmath583 ( planck time ) , which is out of the scope of the classical physics , the observed uniformity of density distributions at super - horizon scales may be explained .",
    "in this paper , the general world model for homogeneous and isotropic universe has been proposed . by introducing the world reference frame as a global and fiducial system of reference",
    ", we have defined the line element so that the effect of cosmic expansion on the physical space - time separation can be correctly included in the metric . with this framework ,",
    "we have demonstrated theoretically that the flat universe is equivalent to the minkowski space - time and that the universe with positive energy density is always spatially closed and finite . the open universe is unrealistic because it can not accommodate positive energy density .",
    "therefore , in the world of ordinary materials , only the spatially closed universe is possible to exist .",
    "the naturalness of the finite world with positive energy density comes from the mach s principle that the motion of a mass particle depends on the mass distribution of the entire world .",
    "the principle is consistent only with the finite world because the dynamics of a reference frame can not be defined in the infinite , empty world .",
    "the closed world model satisfies the mach s principle and supports einstein s perspective on the physical universe .",
    "we have reconstructed evolution histories of the closed world models that are consistent with the recent astronomical observations , based on the nearly flat frw world models ( model i and ii ; sec .",
    "[ sec : some ] ) .",
    "the present curvature radius of the universe is @xmath584 gpc ( @xmath585 gpc ) for model i ( model ii ) .",
    "the expansion histories of both models imply that the closed universe dominated by dark energy expands eternally . however , the currently favored flat frw world exists only as a limiting case of the closed universe with infinite curvature radius that is expanding with the maximum speed ( @xmath586 , @xmath587 ) .    from the local nature of the frw metric ( sec .",
    "[ sec : metric ] ) and of the proper time of a comoving observer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rel_friedmann ] ) , it is clear that the frw world model describes the local universe as observed by the comoving observer . since the newton s gravitation law can be derived from the einstein s field equations in the weak field and the small velocity limits , the gravitational action at a distance usually holds at a local region of space on scales far smaller than the hubble horizon size ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the proper hubble radius @xmath588 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] , top ) may provide a reasonable estimate of the characteristic distance scale where the newton s gravity applies .",
    "the cosmic structures simulated by the newton s gravity - based @xmath2-body method will significantly deviate from the real structures on scales comparable to @xmath588 .",
    "the variation of the comoving hubble radius @xmath589 also implies that in the past ( future ) the newtonian dynamics was ( will be ) applicable on smaller region of space compared to the size of the universe ( fig . [",
    "fig : horizon ] , bottom ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the history of the universe has been tentatively reconstructed based on cosmological parameters of non - flat frw world models . the more general cosmological perturbation theory and parameter estimation",
    "are essential for accurate reconstruction of the cosmic history .",
