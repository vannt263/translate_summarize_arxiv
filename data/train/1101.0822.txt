    "bouncing cosmologies can also be obtained using arguments from superstring theory .",
    "for example , the string gas cosmology scenario @xcite may be embedded in a bouncing universe as realized in @xcite .",
    "non - singular bounces may also be studied using effective field theory techniques by introducing matter fields violating certain energy conditions , for example non - conventional fluids @xcite , quintom matter @xcite , or ghost condensates @xcite .",
    "a specific realization of a quintom bounce occurs in the lee - wick cosmology studied in @xcite .",
    "various original bounce models were reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the context of studies of bouncing cosmologies",
    "it has been realized that fluctuations which are generated as quantum vacuum perturbations and exit the hubble radius during a matter - dominated contracting phase lead to a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations today @xcite ( see also @xcite for an earlier discussion ) .",
    "this yields an alternative to inflation for explaining the current observational data , which is dubbed as the _ matter bounce _ ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , in this scenario there are still unclear issues . for example , since scalar and tensor modes grow at the same rate in a matter - dominated phase of contraction , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is typically too large to be consistent with current observational data . also , the possible generation of entropy during the non - singular bounce phase needs to be studied in detail . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the first question , leaving the second for a followup paper @xcite .    to date ,",
    "entropy fluctuations have not been considered in matter bounce models . however",
    ", realistic matter theories will contain many entropy modes . in the context of inflationary cosmology",
    ", it has been realized that entropy fluctuations can lead to an additional source of curvature fluctuations , a source which may in fact dominate @xcite .",
    "this is now know as the  curvaton mechanism \" for generating fluctuations .",
    "entropy fluctuations also play an important role in the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite . in that scenario ,",
    "the primordial adiabatic fluctuations in the contracting phase acquire a steep blue spectrum , whereas the entropy modes induced by light scalar fields will be scale - invariant .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the fluctuations induced by a light spectator field @xmath0 and see that they acquire a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations in a matter - dominated phase of contraction if they originate in their vacuum state on sub - hubble scales .",
    "we will show that these entropy fluctuations induce a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations after the bounce .",
    "the transfer of entropy to adiabatic perturbations occurs during the bounce phase .",
    "we can easily find parameter values for which these secondary curvature perturbations are larger in magnitude than the primordial ones .",
    "this will lead to a suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio .    as a simple example",

    "note that in a successful bouncing cosmology the usual energy conditions need to be recovered after the bounce so that the universe is able to evolve smoothly into the radiation and matter dominated periods .",

    "we study the specific model given by the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we find that the entropy field @xmath0 evolves as a tracking solution in the contracting phase due to the coupling to the background scalar @xmath2 , and may become dominant during a short deflationary phase before the bounce .",
    "the fluctuations of the entropy field are nearly scale - invariant provided the coupling parameter @xmath3 is small enough . a controllable amplification on the entropy modes due to the kinetic term of the entropy field can be obtained in the bouncing phase , and these entropy modes will be converted to curvature perturbations during the bounce . therefore , we can obtain an enhancement of the primordial curvature spectrum and hence a suppression of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "this is the main message of this work . another",
    "interesting fact is that the conversion of entropy fluctuations to curvature perturbation provides a sizable non - gaussianity for curvature perturbations for which the sign tends to be negative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide the basic equations of the theory .",
    "in section iii we study the generation of isocurvature fluctuations in the contracting phase . in section",
    "iv we analyze the conversion of the isocurvature perturbations into curvature fluctuations during the bounce and show that a reasonable amplitude of the primordial power spectrum can be obtained .",
    "section v presents a summary and discussions of related works .",
    "we use the convention @xmath4 in this paper .",
    "to be specific , we will be considering the background space - time which emerges from a quintom bounce ( see for example @xcite ) scenario in which regular matter is modelled by a scalar field @xmath2 with mass @xmath5 and the non - singular bounce is induced by adding a ghost scalar field @xmath6 with a much larger mass @xmath7 to the system .",
    "[ fig - st ] is a sketch of the evolution of scales in our matter bounce model .",
    "the vertical axis represents conformal time , the horizontal axis comoving distance .",
    "initially , both the regular matter field and the ghost field are oscillating , with amplitudes which are increasing since the universe is contracting . during this period , the hubble radius is decreasing linearly and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the energy density is dominated by the regular field @xmath2 .",
    "once the amplitude of the regular field @xmath2 reaches the value @xmath9 , the field will cease to oscillate .",
    "this happens at conformal time @xmath10 .",
    "a short deflationary `` slow climb '' phase will begin during which the hubble radius @xmath11 is nearly constant . in this period",
    "the ghost field continues to oscillate .",
    "hence , the ( negative ) energy density of the ghost field catches up to the ( positive ) energy density of the field @xmath2 and a short non - singular bounce period will result during which @xmath12 .",
    "the conformal time @xmath13 is the transition between the deflationary phase and the bounce period . after the bouncing phase there is a short period of inflation lasting until @xmath14 , after which the universe enters the expanding phase with a normal thermal history .",
    "we denote the bounce time by @xmath15 .     and the wavelength @xmath16 of a fluctuation with comoving wavenumber @xmath17 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig - st ] we plot the evolution of the length corresponding to a fixed comoving scale .",
    "this scale is the wavelength of the fluctuation mode @xmath17 ( @xmath17 standing for the comoving wavenumber ) which we want to follow .",
    "the wavelength begins in the contracting phase inside the hubble radius , exits the hubble radius during this phase and re - enters the hubble radius during the normal expanding phase .",
    "it is important that scales of interest exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase of contraction .",
    "this is required to obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "important is also that there is a phase during which the energy density in the entropy field grows relative to the energy density in the field @xmath2 .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied in the quintom bounce scenario .",
    "it is required in order that the conversion of the entropy fluctuations to curvature perturbations is efficient .",
    "the efficiency of our transfer mechanism will depend on whether the initial energy density of the entropy field @xmath0 is larger than the ( absolute value of ) the energy density in the ghost field @xmath6 .",
    "we shall see that our mechanism is more efficient if @xmath0 dominates .",
    "the key goal of our paper is to understand how entropy perturbations are generated in the contracting phase , then pass through the bounce , and finally convert into curvature perturbations after the bounce . in the following , we will study cosmological perturbation theory in the nonsingular bouncing cosmological background described above .",
    "we shall work in longitudinal gauge in which the linearized scalar metric fluctuations appear in the metric in the following way : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is cosmic time and @xmath20 are the comoving spatial coordinates .",
    "the scalar metric fluctuations are characterized by two functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 which depend both on space and time .",

    "however , the presence of entropy fluctuations on large scales will lead to a growth of @xmath30 which corresponds to the seeding of an adiabatic fluctuation mode by the entropy mode .    at linear order ,",

    "note , however , that in our case we have three fields , the regular matter field @xmath2 , the isocurvature field @xmath0 and the ghost matter field",
    "@xmath6 which is responsible for yielding the non - singular bounce .    in the following we will study how in our non - singular bouncing cosmology the presence of primordial isocurvature fluctuations induces via ( [ dotzeta ] ) a contribution to the curvature perturbations .",
    "we will consider two cases : the first where the isocurvature field @xmath0 initially contributes more to the density than the ghost field , the second case where @xmath0 is sub - dominant at the background level to the ghost field .",
    "in this section we show that the isocurvature mode acquires a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations on scales which exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase of contraction , provided the initial conditions are taken to be vacuum .",
    "we will consider the model of ( [ potential ] ) , where the entropy mode corresponds to the scalar field @xmath0 which is taken to be massless .",
    "note that since the ghost field @xmath6 has a large mass , its spectrum will not be scale - invariant .",
    "it will be highly suppressed in the infrared .",
    "hence , @xmath6 can not play the role of the entropy field for our purpose .",
    "we consider a matter bounce background evolution of a frw universe in which the matter - dominated phase of contraction is realized by the oscillations of a massive scalar field @xmath2 around it vacuum state ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for other realizations ) .",
    "hence , the hubble parameter can be approximately expressed by @xmath37 where the angular brackets stand for averaging over time .",
    "the solution for the scalar field @xmath2 can be asymptotically expressed as @xmath38 with a time dependent amplitude , @xmath39 which yields an equation of state which has vanishing pressure after averaging over an oscillation period of the field .",
    "since the entropy field @xmath0 is much lighter than the background scalar @xmath2 and we assume that it does not have a large initial homogeneous mode , it has nothing to do with the background evolution before the bounce phase .",
    "its evolution is determined by the equation of motion @xmath40 where we have averaged the coherent oscillations of the background scalar in the mass term and inserted a factor @xmath41 instead ( parametric resonance instabilities resulting as a consequence of the oscillatory nature of @xmath2 @xcite - see @xcite for a recent review - will be studied in a subsequent paper ) .",
    "this equation yields the following solution for @xmath0 : @xmath42 which evolves at the same rate as the amplitude of the background scalar if @xmath43 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to define a parameter @xmath44 ( where the subscripts `` i '' indicate the initial value of the corresponding fields ) , and then in the matter - dominated contracting phase we have @xmath45 .",
    "let us now turn to the fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "let us recall @xcite that the finding that curvature fluctuations acquire a scale - invariant spectrum in the matter bounce scenario is based on assuming that the canonically normalized curvature fluctuation variable starts out in its vacuum state early in the contracting phase .",
    "it is hence reasonable to assume that also the fluctuations of @xmath0 start out in their vacuum state on scales smaller than the hubble radius early in the contracting phase .",
    "we focus on scale which exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase of contraction and will show that due to the growth of fluctuations on super - hubble scales a flat spectrum of isocurvature perturbations results .",
    "we are interested in the scalar perturbation @xmath46 , where we write @xmath47 it is important to focus on the canonically normalized perturbation variable @xmath48 in terms of which quantum vacuum initial conditions can be imposed .",
    "we work on the spatially - flat slice where the metric fluctuation @xmath21 vanishes . on this slice ,",
    "the scalar field perturbations satisfy the klein - gordon equation@xcite @xmath49 where we have defined the effective mass term of the entropy field @xmath50 and made use of the conformal time @xmath51 .",
    "a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath52 . comparing the above equation of motion with the basic perturbation equation ( [ pertq ] )",
    ", one may notice that the effective mass originating from the kinetic term of @xmath0 and the coupling between the isocurvaure and adiabatic perturbations has been neglected .",
    "this is justified since it is subdominant in the matter - dominated contracting phase .    initially , the @xmath53 term dominates eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , and so we can neglect the mass term and gravitational term .",
    "thus , the dynamics corresponds to a free scalar propagating in a flat spacetime , and the initial condition takes the form of the bunch - davies vacuum : @xmath54 during the phase of background contraction , the quantum fluctuations exit the hubble radius and become classical perturbations ( see @xcite for an analysis of the classicalization ) . for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "( [ eqv ] ) becomes @xmath57 the second term inside the parentheses on the left hand side of this equation is the term which leads to the squeezing of the fluctuations , and the coefficient and time dependence is exactly that required to transform a blue vacuum spectrum into a scale - invariant spectrum @xcite .",
    "we can see this explicitly as follows : making use of the vacuum initial condition , we obtain an exact solution to ( [ squeeze ] ) : @xmath58 note that , in contracting phase these perturbations are able to grow outside the hubble radius .",
    "their amplitudes will keep increasing until the universe enters the contracting phase ends .",
    "thus , from ( [ sol ] ) it follows that on scales larger than the hubble radius , the amplitude of the spectrum of @xmath46 in the contracting phase is given by @xmath59 which is a function of cosmic time . from eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , we are able to calculate the spectral tilt @xmath60 of the primordial perturbations @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the effective mass of the @xmath0 field induced by the coupling to @xmath2 . in the specific model given by ( [ potential ] ) , we apply the amplitude of the background scalar @xmath63 and the ratio @xmath64 , and then obtain the spectral tilt @xmath65 from this result , we find that in order to ensure that the isocurvature perturbation are nearly scale - invariant , one has to require @xmath66 .",
    "one can also estimate the amplitude of tensor perturbations @xmath67 .",
    "it is well known that the tensor fluctuation amplitude satisfies the same equation of motion as a free scalar field in the given cosmological background . hence ,",
    "following the analysis done above for the fluctuations in the scalar field @xmath0 , we obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of tensor modes ( again assuming that they start out in their vacuum state ) , and an amplitude of the spectrum given by @xmath68 the tensor perturbation amplitude has the same order of magnitude as that of the adiabatic scalar metric perturbations .",
    "thus ( in terms of the usual ratio @xmath69 of the tensor to scalar metric power spectrum ) , the matter bounce usually leads to a dangerously large value of @xmath70 . from current observational cmb data @xcite",
    ", this ratio is required to be less than @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , in order that a matter bounce scenario be consistent with current observations on the value of @xmath70 , it is necessary that there be a mechanism to amplify the size of the scalar metric perturbations . in the following we will show that the entropy mode studied in this paper can provide an efficient mechanism to enhance the spectrum of curvature fluctuations .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : we expect that the entropy field will rapidly grow during the final instances of the contracting phase . in this case",
    ", isocurvature perturbations can be converted into curvature perturbations as described by ( [ dotzeta1 ] ) .",
    "after the bounce , the evolution of the universe will enter the normal thermal history .",
    "in contrast to the bounce scenario without entropy modes , in the current model the energy scale for the bounce is able to be lowered and so the amplitude of tensor spectrum can be suppressed . therefore , our model can solve the problem of large tensor - to - scalar ratio which generally exists in nonsingular bounce cosmologies @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the energy scale can be lowered to the tev level , our scenario may lead to a window to test a bounce in particle physics .",
    "as the universe contracts in the matter - dominated phase , the hubble parameter increases . when it catches up to the mass @xmath5 of the background field @xmath2 , the oscillations of this field will freeze out .",
    "after freeze - out , @xmath2 will slowly climb up the potential . as long as the total energy density",
    "is dominated by @xmath2 , the equation of state will decrease from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the universe will enter a contracting deflationary period and then approach the bouncing point . during this phase , both the isocurvature field @xmath0 and the ghost field @xmath6 will increase exponentially in amplitude .",
    "thus , after a brief deflationary phase either @xmath0 or @xmath6 will come to dominate .",
    "if the energy density of @xmath6 is larger , then the bounce point is reached when the energy densities of @xmath2 and @xmath6 become equal .",
    "we will denote this case as `` case 2 '' . in the other case ( `` case 1 '' ) there will be another brief phase of contraction driven by @xmath0 , followed by another brief deflationary phase and a bounce when @xmath74 .",
    "note that the deflationary phases can be understood as the time reversal of a period of slow - roll inflation .",
    "we first study the evolution of the entropy scalar @xmath0 in the deflationary period . from studies of chaotic type inflation models",
    ", it is well known that the background field @xmath2 freezes out when its amplitude @xmath63 becomes of the order of the planck mass , more specifically when @xmath75 this leads to a nearly constant hubble parameter @xmath76 and an almost exponentially decreasing scale factor for the universe . in this period ,",
    "the scalars @xmath0 and @xmath6 will grow exponentially and the density in one of them will soon catch up to the density of background field .",
    "the background equation of motion ( [ eomchi ] ) yields @xmath77~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which evolves proportional to @xmath78 . here , the time @xmath79 is the end of the matter - dominated epoch of contraction , and the subscripts `` m '' on the fields @xmath2 and @xmath0 indicate the values of those field at the time @xmath79 .",
    "we will write @xmath80 where the values of the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( both much smaller than @xmath83 ) depend on the initial conditions . we will denote the larger of the two numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 by @xmath64 .",
    "the deflationary phase will end when the energy of one of the fields @xmath0 and @xmath6 catches up to that in @xmath2 .",
    "this will occur at the moment @xmath84 given by @xmath85 in case 1 and @xmath86 in case 2 .",
    "the difference between the two cases is due to the fact that @xmath6 is oscillating in the deflationary phase , but @xmath0 is not .",
    "hence , the expressions for the energy density of the two fields take a different form .",
    "let us now turn to the evolution of the entropy fluctuations which is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) . in a de sitter phase of contraction",
    "the dominant solution is @xmath87 which corresponds to @xmath88 hence , it follows that the power spectrum of @xmath89 gets enhanced during the deflationary phase by a factor @xmath90 in case 1 and @xmath91 in case 2 .",
    "note , however , that this amplification does _ not _ lead to a suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio since the tensor modes at the same rate during the deflationary phase .",
    "it is only due to matter couplings that a difference between scalar and tensor modes will result .",
    "below , we will see that such an amplification mechanism affecting only the scalar modes results in the post - deflationary phase , a phase driven by the kinetics of the fields .",
    "we do need to worry about the absolute magnitude of the fluctuations .",
    "there is the danger that the amplification in the deflationary phase cause the perturbations become nonlinear .",
    "then , we would lose perturbative control of the analysis .",
    "presumably , this would also imply that space fragments into a gas of black holes rather than undergoing a smooth bounce .",
    "however , from ( [ amplif ] ) and from the fact that the fluctuations start out as quantum vacuum perturbations , it appears that this constraint on the parameters is a fairly mild one .      in this subsection",
    "we will give a rough analysis of how the fluctuations in @xmath0 pass through the bouncing phase .",
    "we will discover that the coupling between the matter fields due to the kinetic terms results in a growth of the entropy fluctuations without corresponding growth of the tensor modes .",
    "we call this process",
    "_ kinetic amplification_.    after the period of deflation , the scalar @xmath0 continues to roll fast , and may even dominate over the background scalar @xmath2 ( in case 1 - see the beginning of this section for the definition of what the cases are ) . in this case , the universe evolves with a background equation of state which varies from @xmath92 during deflation to @xmath93 during @xmath0 domination . in this case",
    ", the dominant term in the background friedmann equation is the kinetic term of the scalar @xmath0 , and leads to a nearly conserved quantity @xmath94 during this short period .",
    "in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ chid ] ) we see that @xmath95    as discussed earlier , eventually the energy density in the ghost field @xmath6 catches up and the bounce phase will be triggered .",
    "thus , the universe will exit the contraction phase and the equation of state of the universe will cross @xmath96 and fall to negative infinity . in order to study the evolution of perturbations through the bouncing phase analytically ,",
    "it is convenient to model the evolution of the hubble parameter in the following form : @xmath97 with some positive coefficient @xmath98 which has dimensions of @xmath53 and whose magnitude is set by the microphysics of the bounce .",
    "for example , @xmath99 in the model of lee - wick cosmology@xcite , while in loop quantum cosmology @xmath98 is determined by a regularized planck mass@xcite . note that in the above parametrization we have chosen the time of the bounce to be zero .",
    "to study the perturbation of the @xmath0 field , it is necessary to go back to the complete form of the perturbation equations given by ( [ pertq ] ) .",
    "we will focus on the evolution of @xmath100 . from ( [ pertq ] )",
    "we see that there is a mixing with @xmath101 .",
    "however , since the frequency of @xmath102 is dominated by its mass @xmath5 , @xmath103 keeps oscillating even outside the hubble radius .",
    "hence , its amplitude is much smaller than that of @xmath46 and therefore we neglect its contribution in the equation of motion for @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 effectively decouples from @xmath101 . focusing now on the mass term in the equation of motion for @xmath100 , we notice that since @xmath0 evolves as a stiff fluid with an effective equation of state @xmath104 , the contribution of its kinetic term in the perturbation equation must be taken into account .",
    "this contribution is given by the following term : @xmath105 where we have used the relations ( [ chih ] ) , ( [ dchid ] ) and ( [ hbounce ] ) .    consequently , we obtain the following equation of motion for the fourier modes of the gauge invariant perturbation variable @xmath100 , @xmath106 in the bouncing phase the effective mass term is given by @xmath107 thus , we find that in the bouncing phase the contribution of the kinetic term to the perturbations of the @xmath0 field yields a tachyonic mass term .",
    "this results in an increase in the magnitude of the fluctuations , a process which we call _ kinetic amplification_. note that this amplification does not affect the tensor modes .    in analogy with the theory of preheating",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) , we suggest that the investigation of the perturbation @xmath108 can be simplified by redefining the fluctuation variable @xmath109 then , we obtain a simpler form of the equation of motion for the fluctuations . instead of eq .",
    "( [ pertqb ] ) we now have @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the frequency for the kth mode of the isocurvature perturbations .    consequently , if @xmath112 there exists a period @xmath113 with @xmath114 near the bounce point during which the adiabaticity condition is violated and the dispersion relation of the @xmath0 perturbation is unstable in the infrared limit . in this case",

    "since this instability arises from the kinetic term of the entropy field , we call this process _ kinetic amplification_. one can describe the amplification of the infrared modes of isocurvature perturbations in this resonance stage as follows : @xmath119 with an amplification factor @xmath120 \\nonumber\\\\   & \\simeq & \\ , e^{\\sqrt{y(2+y ) } + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sinh^{-1}(\\frac{2\\sqrt{y}}{3})}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above calculation , we have introduced a variable @xmath121 which characterizes how fast the bouncing phase occurs .    to understand the exponent appearing in the amplification factor @xmath122 , we plot its evolution as a function of the variable @xmath123 in fig . [",
    "fig : ffactor ] .",
    "one can see that in the limit of a fast bounce @xmath124 ( which corresponds to @xmath125 ) the contribution of kinetic amplification is quite limited since the duration of the bouncing phase is very short .",
    "in the case of the lee - wick cosmology @xmath126 and thus gives @xmath127 , and correspondingly we obtain a value of the amplification factor @xmath128 which is quite sizable .     as a function of the variable @xmath123 in the bouncing phase .",

    "one interesting issue which should be noticed that , if we choose the value of the coefficient @xmath98 to be between @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbation will be distinctly amplified .",
    "this case corresponds to a slow bouncing phase .",
    "this amplification becomes more efficient if we take the coupling parameter @xmath134 to be slightly negative which provides a flat tachyonic potential for the entropy field .",
    "after the bounce , the universe will eventually re - emerge into a matter - dominated phase , this time a phase of cosmological expansion .",
    "since the dominant mode of both scalar and tensor fluctuations on super - hubble scales is constant , no further amplification of the entropy fluctuations results , nor do scalar and tensor perturbations evolve asymmetrically .",
    "now let us take into account both of the amplification effects on the @xmath0 fluctuations discussed in the two previous subsections . combining the relations ( [ amplif ] ) and ( [ dchib ] ) and applying the relation ( [ dchic ] ) at the beginning of the period of deflation at the time @xmath135",

    "next , we will study the induced curvature fluctuations , the `` matter bounce curvaton '' mechanism .",
    "the transfer takes place in the deflationary phase and in the bouncing phase when the equation of state of the background is changing because of the contribution of the entropy field .",
    "we first study the linear curvature fluctuations induced by the isocurvature fluctuation . to do this",
    ", we return to the general formula ( [ dotzeta ] ) which describes the transfer of isocurvature to curvature fluctuations . making use of the fact that @xmath137 and inserting the definition of @xmath138 we find that on large scales ( [ dotzeta ] ) reduces to @xmath139 since the spectrum of the ghost field @xmath6 has a blue spectrum due to the large mass of the ghost , the ghost field contribution to ( [ dotzeta2 ] ) can be neglected , and only two terms remain in the sum , the one due to @xmath2 and the one due to the entropy field .",
    "since in our realization of the bounce scenario the regular matter field @xmath2 is massive , its contribution to ( [ dotzeta2 ] ) is also negligible .",
    "a second way to see that the term proportional to @xmath103 gives a negligible contribution to ( [ dotzeta2 ] ) is to realize that until the entropy field @xmath0 begins to dominate the background , the factor @xmath140 is approximately constant and thus the coefficient of the @xmath103 term vanishes .",
    "thus , ( [ dotzeta2 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath141 the right hand side of this expression vanishes at the beginning of the deflationary phase and gradually grows until the bounce phase is reached .",
    "we can approximately integrate the equation to obtain @xmath142    let us first evaluate the magnitude of the induced curvature fluctuations in case 1 , when @xmath143 . in this case the contribution of the ghost condensate field to @xmath144 at the time when the deflationary period ends can be neglected and @xmath145 when the @xmath0 field starts to dominate the energy density , the magnitudes of @xmath146 and @xmath147 are comparable , and hence @xmath148 making use of the background solution for the scalar @xmath0 and the amplification of the amplitude of the isocurvature perturbation @xmath149 before and during the bounce , we finally obtain the following estimate for the induced curvature perturbation @xmath150 where we have used relation ( [ chih ] ) which is approximately valid during the deflationary and bounce periods .",
    "next , let us turn to case 2 .",
    "now , @xmath144 is dominated by @xmath151 instead of by @xmath146 in the bounce region .",
    "the numerator in ( [ dotzeta3 ] ) remains the same as for case 1 .",
    "hence , the overall amplitude of the induced curvature fluctuations is suppressed by a factor @xmath152 , where @xmath153 compared to what happens in case 1 .",
    "the tensor modes are also amplified during the deflationary phase , as mentioned earlier .",
    "thus , they also obtain the amplification factor @xmath154 .",
    "their overall amplitude is hence the same as that of the induced curvature fluctuations , except for the factor @xmath122 due to kinetic amplification .",
    "hence , the predicted tensor to scalar ratio @xmath70 in case 1 is @xmath155 its magnitude is determined by two parameters , namely the mass of the heavy field @xmath5 and the slope of the bouncing phase @xmath98 .    according to the latest observations from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-year data ( wmap7 ) @xcite ,",
    "the amplitude of curvature perturbation is @xmath156 and the spectral tilt is @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the observed amplitude of the curvature perturbations can be obtained in our scenario if we require @xmath158    for completeness , let us mention ( as was already used above in ( [ tensor ] ) ) that in our model the amplitude of tensor perturbation is about @xmath159 .",

    "our analytical calculations involve some approximations .",
    "specifically , in the deflationary phase the hubble parameter is not exactly a constant and the background scalar @xmath2 is still rolling slowly , but in our analytical analysis we have taken their values at the freeze - out time . as a consequence ,",
    "it is important to confirm the results by a numerical integration of the full equations .",
    "we first numerically study the evolution of two scalars .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] , in the era of contraction , the heavy field @xmath2 keeps oscillating with an increasing amplitude and dominates the background evolution , while the light field @xmath0 tracks the evolution of @xmath2 .",

    "this numerical result is consistent with the analytic estimates appeared in eqs .",

    "however , in our numerical calculations the background evolution ceases around the moment of @xmath0 domination which is before the big bounce .",

    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : perts ] that the perturbation of the heavy field ( the adiabatic mode after the bounce ) catches up to the amplitude of the entropy field perturbation .",
    "this demonstrates the effectiveness of the `` matter bounce curvaton '' mechanism discussed here .",
    "note that @xmath101 keeps oscillating through the whole evolution .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuation @xmath108 grows before the bounce , however , with a different slope than the growth of @xmath101 .",
    "this difference in slope is due to the transfer of isocurvature to curvature fluctuation .",

    "[ fig : bg ] . ]      next we take a first look at an important byproduct of the `` matter bounce curvaton '' scenario , namely a contribution to the induced non - gaussian distribution of metric fluctuations which will be of local form .",
    "there are two important periods for generating a large non - gaussianity in a bouncing universe .",
    "the first is the evolution of metric perturbations on super - hubble scales in the contracting phase which at leading non - linear order generates non - gaussianities as studied in refs .",
    "this generates an effective value of the non - linearity parameter @xmath172 which is of order one , the largeness being due to the fact that what corresponds to the inflationary slow - roll parameter is now a constant of order one .",
    "a distinctive feature of this source of non - linearity is a particular shape of the bispectrum .",
    "the shape is different than the one which appears in simple inflationary models since in the contracting phase @xmath30 is not constant and hence terms depending on @xmath173 which vanish in inflationary cosmology contribute in an important way to the bispectrum .",
    "the second effect is a contribution to the bispectrum of local form which results from the curvaton mechanism .",
    "it is due to the transformation of entropy perturbations into curvature fluctuations which happens around the bounce point .",
    "here , we focus on the second effect .    a naive way to investigate the non - gaussianity is to study the cosmological fluctuations to second order@xcite . recalling the time evolution of the curvature perturbation given in eq .",
    "( [ dotzeta1 ] ) and taking the next - to - leading order corrections into account , we are able to decompose the curvature perturbation into a gaussian part and a non - linear one , where the second part evolves according to the following equation@xcite : @xmath174 on long wavelengths . in the above formula , we have introduced the adabatic field @xmath175 , the isocurvature field @xmath176 , and the trajectory angle @xmath177 satisfying @xmath178 and @xmath179 .    as usual",
    ", we define a nonlinearity parameter @xmath180 to measure the amplitude of non - gaussian perturbations .",
    "this parameter is defined by the relation @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the linear order value of curvature perturbation . as analyzed in the previous section ,",
    "we consider the leading non - gaussianity when modes are at super - hubble scales , and thus the non - gaussianity is of the local type@xcite .",

    "we get @xmath185 by making use of @xmath186 ; for case 2 , we obtain @xmath187 in both two cases , we see that it is possible to generate a sizable non - gaussianity in our model by this mechanism .",
    "specifically , a large non - gaussianity of local type can be obtained for a small value of @xmath64 in case 2 .",
    "for example , taking the value of the parameters to be such that @xmath188 which satisfies the theoretical bound discussed at the end of the appendix , we find that with @xmath189 one gets @xmath190 , a value which is consistent with current observational constraints which give @xmath191 at the @xmath192 level , but a value which is not too small to be detectable in upcoming experiments .",
    "although the mechanism discussed above is quite efficient to generate a sizable non - gaussianity , there are other sources which could potentially also give a large value of @xmath180 . for example , we expect that preheating effects will lead to a major contribution .",
    "in particular , they will affect the shape of the non - gaussianities , a topic we did not study here .",
    "we will leave the detailed study of this issue to a future publication .",
    "in this paper we introduced the `` matter bounce curvaton '' scenario , a new mechanism to generate a scale - invariant primordial spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the framework of a nonsingular bounce cosmology with a matter - dominated phase of contraction .",
    "this model is able to solve the `` large @xmath70 problem '' from which many bouncing cosmologies suffer , while preserving the scale - invariance of the power spectrum .",
    "our scenario is based on taking into account the contributions of light fields to the curvature fluctuations .",
    "the light fields act as curvatons .",
    "they acquire a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations on super - hubble scales during the contracting phase . as we have shown , the change in the equation of state immediately before and during the bounce phase leads to the transfer of the fluctuations to the adiabatic mode , maintaining the scale - invariance of the spectrum .",
    "we have studied our mechanism in a concrete realization of the matter bounce scenario , namely the quintom bounce , a scenario in which the violation of the null energy condition which is required to obtain a non - singular bounce is obtained via the addition of a ghost field .",
    "however , the mechanism will also be effective in other realizations of the matter bounce .",
    "as we have shown here , just before and during the bounce , the entropy fluctuations are amplified by an effective tachyonic mass due to a kinetic resonance .",
    "we have called this process `` kinetic amplification '' . whereas the scalar modes are amplified by this mechanism ,",
    "the gravitational waves are not .",
    "thus , our scenario leads to a suppression of the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath70 .",
    "the kinetic amplification mechanism is more effective if the bounce is slower , since then the time interval during which the entropy fluctuations see an effective tachyonic mass is longer .",
    "the kinetic amplification mechanism is also more effective if the energy density in the entropy field initially dominates over the absolute value of the energy density in the ghost field .",
    "we also have taken a first look at non - gaussianities from our mechanism .",
    "specifically , we have discussed one source of local type non - gaussianity generated in our curvaton mechanism .",
    "we find , for typical parameter values , the predicted amplitude is quite sizable to be observationally relevant .",
    "there are other sources , however , which are expected to lead to even larger effects .",
    "note that there have recently been some attempts to seed sizable non - gaussianity in the framework of inflationary preheating@xcite .",
    "the distinguishing difference between their models and ours is that in our case the non - gaussian fluctuations arise even for modes in the far infrared , modes relevant for current cosmological observations .",
