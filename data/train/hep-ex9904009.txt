    "an important part of the @xmath1 factory program at slac and kek will be to search for cp violation in the mixing and decay of neutral @xmath1 mesons . in close analogy with the kaon system",
    ", the weak interaction allows mixing of the @xmath2 and the @xmath6 through a second - order @xmath7 transition .",
    "the cp violation in this picture results from the interference between the amplitude for the decay @xmath8 to some cp eigenstate @xmath9 and the amplitude for mixing to occur first and then the decay , @xmath10 . when the two amplitudes have a relative weak phase , cp violation results .",
    "such weak phases arise in the standard model because of the complex ckm matrix @xcite .    in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix@xcite ,",
    "the phase of @xmath11 is @xmath12 and both the ckm elements @xmath11 and @xmath13 are expected to have large phases .",
    "thus it is hoped cp violation may be observed in the @xmath1 system .",
    "figure 1 shows schematically the current experimental bounds@xcite on the ckm phase @xmath14 from @xmath15 mixing , from measurements of @xmath16 and from limits on @xmath17 mixing .",
    "also shown is the bound from measurements of @xmath18 in neutral kaons .",
    "overlaid on the figure is a triangle whose sides are related to products of ckm elements that results from the requirement that the ckm matrix is unitary  @xcite : @xmath19 the angles @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are all , in principal , measurable from decays of @xmath1 mesons .    the phenomonon of @xmath2 mixing is described in a similar way to the mixing of the neutral kaons : initially pure @xmath23 and @xmath24 states are written as orthogonal mixtures of heavy and light @xmath1 states . because the heavy and light states each evolve with their own time- dependences , there is a quantum - mechanical oscillation of an initially pure @xmath2 or @xmath6 .",
    "the weak ( ckm ) phases in the mixing as well as in the decay amplitudes cause a cp asymmetry in the mixing and decay of initially pure neutral @xmath1 s as they time - evolve : @xmath25    in the @xmath1 system it is possible to cleanly extract the weak phases from such asymmetries , in contrast with the situation in kaon mixing . in the standard model the asymmetry for @xmath15 mixing reduces to @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cp sign of the final state @xmath9 .",
    "the factor @xmath28 describes the weak phases in the @xmath1 mixing , and the factor @xmath29 appears whenever the final state @xmath9 has a @xmath30 or @xmath31 to account for kaon mixing in addition to @xmath1 mixing phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is the @xmath33 mass difference ( for either neutral @xmath34 or @xmath15 mesons ) .",
    "for @xmath15 mesons , the phase @xmath35 from the presence of intermediate top quarks in the box diagram describing @xmath36 mixing.@xcite the phase of the decay amplitudes depends upon the quark to which the @xmath37 decays . for @xmath38 decays",
    ", there is no weak phase since @xmath39 is almost real.@xcite thus @xmath40 decays in @xmath15 mixing gives us    @xmath41 ,    @xmath42    it should be noted that in extracting the value of @xmath43 from the mixing asymmetry , there is a four - fold ambiguity in the actual value of @xmath21 that is inferred from this measurement . in principle , present data , as shown in figure 1 , along with recent indications from the cdf experiment@xcite , indicate that @xmath44>0 $ ]",
    ". it may be further possible@xcite to furthermore remove the last two - fold ambiguity , as mentioned in section viii .    in this paper",
    "i review several branching ratio measurements of @xmath40 transitions of @xmath15 mesons that are relevant to future @xmath1 factories in measuring @xmath45 .",
    "the modes discussed are :    @xmath46    the above branching ratios were measured by the cleo experiment running at the symmetric @xmath47 cesr collider at cornell unversity.@xcite the goal in studying these decays is to see how many events may be used for studying cp violation above and beyond the so - called  gold - plated  mode of @xmath48 .",
    "the last three decay modes are of course not cp eigenstates , but may still be used for studying cp violation , as is discussed below .    the observation of cp violation in @xmath2 mixing and decay is a powerful first step toward proving cp violation is not simply a feature inherent to neutral kaons .",
    "the observation of this kind of cp violation will be an important confirmation of the ckm model@xcite .",
    "most of the studies presented in this paper represent the yield of 6.3 fb@xmath49 of data , which amounts to @xmath50 6 million @xmath51 pairs .",
    "an additional 3 fb@xmath49 was taken 60 mev below the @xmath52(4s ) to study backgrounds from continuum @xmath53 light quark production .    at the @xmath52(4s ) , it is convenient to use two kinematic constraints in reconstructing @xmath1 mesons from their daughter particles . noting that the @xmath1 energy is exactly the @xmath54 beam energy , we form the invariant mass of @xmath1 candidates from @xmath55 since the beam energy is very well measured .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the total energy @xmath56 of our @xmath1 candidates and form the variable @xmath57 which should peak at zero for true signal .",
    "resolutions on these quantities are @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 mev .    while the analyses which identify final - state @xmath60 mesons differ slightly in their selection criteria , all of these studies were done by first selecting events where the @xmath60 decays to @xmath61 or @xmath62 pairs , which comprise just 12% of the @xmath60 branching ratio . for these analyses ,",
    "lepton selection criteria were imposed for both the daughter leptons in the @xmath60 decays , so the efficiencies for reconstructing the @xmath60 are typically @xmath63 . in future @xmath1 factory experiments it may be possible to relax such selection criteria and thereby increase the reconstruction efficiencies for these decays.@xcite    to suppress the @xmath60 s which come from continuum @xmath64 , a cut of @xmath65 was imposed . thus , unless explictely mentioned otherwise , the backgrounds to the modes considered here from @xmath66 decays .",
    "cleo has previously measured the inclusive @xmath67 momentum distribution@xcite , and our monte carlo model of @xmath1 decays , which includes several different exclusive @xmath60 modes , reproduces very well the observed @xmath60 momentum distribution .",
    "therefore , many of the background estimates , which rely heavily on our monte carlo , are well modelled .",
    "the decay @xmath68 with @xmath69 is a so - called  gold - plated  cp eigenstate because the distinctive signature of two leptons from the @xmath60 and two charged tracks emanating from a point detached from the collision point . with efficiencies of @xmath63 for the @xmath60 and @xmath70 for reconstructing the @xmath71",
    ", we observe 75 events in 6.3 fb@xmath49 , as shown in figure 2(a ) . in figure 2(a ) , we plot the @xmath72 of our @xmath48 candidates _ vs. _ their mass .",
    "all quantities are plot in units of the experimental resolution ( see section 2 ) , so signal is expected to lie in a region @xmath73 units from the expected values . using our @xmath74 mc , we expect @xmath75 events background in the sample .",
    "the branching ratio measured is @xmath76@xmath77 , where the first uncertainty is due to statistics and the second due to systematic uncertainties ( in reconstruction efficiencies and the total number of @xmath51 in the sample from which these candidates were selected ) .",
    "it is hoped we can add to this 75 events using the other decay modes below .",
    "to identify @xmath78 decays , we search for pairs of photons in the csi calorimeter which are consistent with the @xmath79 mass using very mass cuts .",
    "when two such pairs are found , then the vector defined by the primary collision point and the center- of - energy of the four photons in the calorimeter is used to define the @xmath30 flight direction . the hypothesized @xmath30 flight distance before decaying is then varied until the two @xmath79 pairings give the best @xmath79 masses .",
    "the @xmath30 is not used in the constraint , but it is found that the @xmath30 mass resolution improves from @xmath80 mev to @xmath81 mev with this procedure .",
    "the @xmath78 reconstruction efficiency is 25% , which , combined with the @xmath60 reconstruction efficiency , yields an overall efficiency of about 10% . at an asymmetric @xmath1 factory one",
    "benefits from an additional constraint of matching the @xmath82 origin to the @xmath2 decay point as measured by the @xmath60 decay .",
    "we observe a signal of 15 events , with an expected background of just 0.7 events from what is believed to be random photons incorrectly paired with a @xmath60 from @xmath1 decays .",
    "however , we are investigating the possible contamination to the sample from @xmath83 decays , since these can readily lend some photons and since the @xmath84 decay mode has a strong cp component .",
    "this yield , when combined with the reconstruction efficiency above , yields a branching ratio of @xmath76@xmath85 ( see table 1 ) , consistent with our result in section iii . more importantly , this decay mode adds 15 more events to our sample of 75 for studying cp violation .",
    "the @xmath87 mode is interesting because in principle it presents the same ( large ) number of events for studying cp asymmetries as does @xmath48 , but the @xmath87 has the opposite cp .",
    "it should therefore exhibit an asymmetry equal in magnitude but opposite in sign as the gold - plated mode .",
    "the difficulty is that the @xmath88 flight path is @xmath89 m , so it does nt decay within the cleo tracking volume .",
    "it is still plausible to detect the @xmath31 s , however , because the cleo csi calorimeter is 0.81 @xmath90 in length , hence approximately 65% of the @xmath31 interact in the calorimeter and initiate a shower that exceeds 100 mev in energy .",
    "thus , the signature for the @xmath91 decay is the lepton pair from the @xmath60 plus a small calorimeter shower from the @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath31 shower is a nuclear interaction , is quite broad in comparison to showers from @xmath22 s .",
    "in fact , often additional nearby showers are created as nuclear fragments travel some distance .",
    "such shape distinctions are used in the selection to successfully reject over 90% of @xmath22 showers .",
    "in fact , of the 66 @xmath87 candidates found , only 10 have showers that are due to random photons incorrectly paired with a @xmath60 ; all the rest are real @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath31 defines its direction , but not its energy .",
    "we use @xmath92 and @xmath93 along with the @xmath31 direction to reconstruct @xmath94 , but loose the @xmath72 constraint . to suppress backgrounds from @xmath95 we reject events which have an additional track that makes a mass @xmath96 gev .",
    "furthermore , we veto events where the @xmath31 candidate shower makes the @xmath79 mass when paired with any other photon in the event in order to reject backgrounds from @xmath97 .    figure 2(b ) shows the results of this search : 66 events are found in 6.7 fb@xmath49 of data , where 35 are expected to be from signal , 31 from backgrounds . as stated earlier , most of these backgrounds are from real @xmath31 s from @xmath98 , @xmath84 , and @xmath99 . the cp dilution of these backgrounds is 15 events .",
    "we have not studied reconstruction efficiencies for this decay mode , although they can be inferred from the yield of 35 events in 6.6 fb@xmath49 and the known branching ratio for @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath102 mode has the same cp and tests a similar feynman diagram to the often - cited decay mode @xmath103.@xcite it is color - suppressed relative to @xmath104 , but perhaps @xmath105 will yield more net events because the @xmath104 channel has few subsequent decay modes which can be reconstructed .",
    "the @xmath105 mode would presumably exhibit a asymmetry of @xmath106 . because it is the cabibbo - suppressed version of the @xmath107",
    ", we can predict the branching ratio will be @xmath76@xmath108 @xmath76@xmath109 or , by isospin conservation , @xmath76@xmath110@xmath76 @xmath111 , where i ve used the previously published cleo result@xcite for @xmath112 .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath113 decays in the csi calorimeter , which has an efficiency of @xmath114 .",
    "we observe 7 candidate events with the background expected to be 0.7 events .",
    "the background comes predominantly from real @xmath60 s from @xmath1 decay paired with random @xmath22 s in the event which accidentally form the @xmath79 mass . with a net detection efficiency of 24.3%",
    ", we obtain a branching ratio of @xmath76@xmath115 .",
    "we used the procedure of feldman and cousins @xcite to obtain the 68% c.l .",
    "intervals for the poisson signal mean .",
    "the @xmath101 decay has the same cp as @xmath116 , so should exhibit the same asymmetry . by isospin , we might expect that @xmath76@xmath117@xmath76@xmath118 . we searched for this mode using @xmath119 decays ( @xmath120 ) . in 6.3 fb@xmath49",
    "no events were seen .",
    "this final state has the same cp as the @xmath48 , so should have the same sign asymmetry .",
    "we select this decay mode by searching for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 decays . in 6.3 fb@xmath49 6 events",
    "were seen on a background of 0.6 events .",
    "the net detector efficiency is 16% , giving a branching ratio of @xmath76@xmath125 .",
    "again , the prescription of feldman and cousins @xcite was used .",
    "the background is expected to consist of random combinations of @xmath60 s and @xmath22 s .",
    "we are investigating the explicit contribution from @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath128 mode is a cp eigenstate and the branching ratio is reported here for the first time .",
    "the @xmath129 mode has previously been observed by cdf@xcite and is not a cp eigenstate : because the two vector particles originate from a spin-0 @xmath2 , there is an additional factor of @xmath130 in the final state cp due to orbital angular momentum between the particles . even though the @xmath131 mode is a superposition of two cp",
    "eigenstates , it is hoped that a single cp state may dominate as with the decay @xmath132 earlier observed by cleo and cdf.@xcite even if both cp states are prominent , however , dunietz has suggested that an angular analysis may be used to separate the two cp components.@xcite in this case , one must look at an angular distribution asymmetry that develops with proper decay time of the @xmath2 instead of just a decay rate asymmetry , so this analysis would require substantially more data .",
    "the @xmath60(2s ) is reconstructed through its @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) decays , and both @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) and @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) decays are considered . in this particular analysis",
    "the lepton identification was somewhat more stringent than the previous analyses , hence the efficiencies are somewhat lower ( see table 1 ) . in the case of the @xmath129 mode ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties are somewhat larger due to our knowledge of the unknown helicity amplitudes in this channel ( we assume @xmath141 , and theoretically 0.5 - 0.7 is expected .",
    "note that cdf and cleo measure @xmath142 for @xmath84 decays@xcite ) .",
    "a total of 15 @xmath128 and 21 @xmath131 candidates are observed ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the backgrounds , totalling @xmath143 and @xmath144 events , respectively , are predominantly due to random combinatorics , but also from @xmath145 decays .",
    "the relative yields of different @xmath60(2s ) and @xmath146 decay modes is consistent with the different detection efficiencies and branching ratios .",
    "in addition to being a possible avenue for extracting @xmath5 , the @xmath147 mode presented here and the @xmath84 earlier measured by cleo@xcite may help resolve two of the four - fold ambiguities in the extracted value of @xmath21 .",
    "the time - development of @xmath148 decays contains additional terms due to the interference between the cp=+1 and cp=-1 components .",
    "this additional interference results in additional terms proportional to @xmath149 , hence a detailed measurement of this decay amplitude may eventually resolve the sign of @xmath150 and remove two of the ambiguities for @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath151 decay mode has a quarter of the decay rate and less than half of the efficiency of the @xmath152 mode , so gives a factor 9 fewer events in our sample ; thus , such a resolution will not come concurrently with a measurement of @xmath45 .",
    "like the yet unobserved decay mode @xmath154 , this decay mode is not expected to be color - suppressed ( as is @xmath105 ) , but it is expected to be cabibbo - suppressed relative to the more prevalent and previously observed decay @xmath155.@xcite so , we might expect a branching ratio for @xmath156 of approximately 0.1% . like the case of the @xmath157 , this mode is mixture of ( + ) and ( - ) cp eigenstates , so a mixing analysis works if one of the amplitudes dominates or one does a time - dependent measurement of an angular asymmetry@xcite .    a more complete description of this analysis has recently been published.@xcite here a brief description is given .",
    "to reconstruct this mode , both @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) and @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) are used , although for background reasons only @xmath162 and @xmath163 modes were considered .",
    "a total of five @xmath164 and six @xmath165 decay modes were considered .    to suppress background ,",
    "two techniques were employed .",
    "the first was kinematic , in which a @xmath166 variable was constructed to compare the reconstructed @xmath167 and @xmath168 masses for candidates within a given event with the known values.@xcite the combinations of particles within an event with the best @xmath166 was chosen , and this combination had to have a @xmath169 ( xx% efficient for signal while xx% efficient for random @xmath51 and @xmath170 backgrounds ) .",
    "the second technique was topological , requiring the flight distance between the @xmath167 and @xmath171 decay vertices , as measured by the silicon vertex detector , to be inconsistent with zero given our experimental resolutions.@xcite this cut was used for events where there was a slow @xmath79 from the @xmath168 decay .",
    "the results of the search are shown in figure 3 : 4 candidates were found .",
    "the background , expected to be 0.4 events , is due to @xmath172 continuum and to @xmath173 decays , where a @xmath167 and a random @xmath174 are incorrectly paired to make a @xmath168 .",
    "the probability of 0.4 events expected background fluctuating to 4 observed events is @xmath175 .",
    "the branching ratio is determined to be @xmath176 , consistent with our expectations and actually quite comparable to the @xmath48 mode .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction efficiency is quite small here , just @xmath177 , which is in part due to the 8% from all the branching ratios of the @xmath167 s and @xmath168 s , but also to the 1% efficiency for reconstructing these high multiplicity decays .",
    "we are currently investigating the possibility of only partially reconstructing one of the @xmath168 s in this decay , and it is furthermore possible that the reconstruction efficiency will be higher at an asymmetric @xmath1 factory due to the lorentz boost of the @xmath1 .",
    "table 1 shows the yields for the cp eigenstates summarized in this paper . in 6.6 fb@xmath49",
    ", 140 events are found amongst all the modes after dilutions are accounted for .",
    "thus , in a 30 fb@xmath49 dataset which might be accumulated by one of the @xmath1 factories in one year s run , one could anticipate 640 events for studying @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section 2 , some of the selection criteria in these various searches have not been optimized for cp studies , hence the efficiencies might be increased by another factor of @xmath178 , giving an anticipated number of events ( after dilution ) to just over 1000 when all modes are included .",
    "furthermore , one can hope for additional background rejection when working at an asymmetric collider . even ignoring such gains ,",
    "however , one should be able to measure @xmath5 with an error of @xmath179 .",
    "the fact that the 3-generation standard model with a single higgs multiplet has just one independent cp - violating phase makes all the cp - violating effects all very strongly constrained .",
    "it will be of great interest to see whether the pattern of cp violation in @xmath1 decays agrees with the prediction of the ckm model , or whether new physics will have to be invoked to understand the ( hopefully many ! ) manifestations of cp violation observed in the next few years .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my many cleo colleagues for the opportunity to represent them at the division of particles and fields conference .",
    "the january los angeles climate is a pleasant departure from upstate new york .",
    "in particular , i thank alexey ershov , alex undrus , andy foland , and david jaffe , whose work is represented here .",
    "i also thank sheldon stone and silvia schuh for helpful discussions .",
    "note that the observation of cp violation in @xmath2 mixing still does not refute the so - called  superweak  theory . to truly confirm the km model ,",
    "so - called  direct cp violation  must be observed , such as by looking for decay rate asymmetries like @xmath183 , @xmath184 , _ etc _ , which was discussed at this conference in the talk of dr .",
