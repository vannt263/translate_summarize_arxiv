    "_ treewidth _ and _ pathwidth _ are one of the basic parameters in graph algorithms and they play an important role in structural graph theory .",
    "numerous problems which are np - hard on general graphs , have been shown to be solvable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth  @xcite .",
    "courcelle  @xcite provided a celebrated algorithmic meta - theorem which states that every graph property expressible in monadic second - order logic formulas ( @xmath3 ) can be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth .    in this paper , we discuss a relatively new notion of _ special treewidth _ , introduced by courcelle  @xcite .",
    "a special tree decomposition is a tree decomposition where for each vertex of a given graph , the bags containing this vertex form a rooted path in the tree .",
    "courcelle developed this parameter to reduce the difficulty in representing tree decompositions algebraically .",
    "the monadic second - order logic ( @xmath3 ) checking algorithm for treewidth in the meta - theorem is based on the constructions of finite automata , and he observed that these constructions become much simpler when working with special tree decompositions compared to standard tree decompositions .",
    "courcelle asked several questions on properties of special treewidth .",
    "one of the questions was how to characterize the class of graphs of special treewidth at most @xmath2 by forbidden configurations . in this context",
    ", he showed that the graphs of special treewidth one are exactly the forests , but if @xmath4 , then the class of graphs of special treewidth at most @xmath2 is not closed under taking minors .    in this paper , we prove that the class of graphs of special treewidth at most two is closed under taking minors , and provide the minor obstruction set .",
    "we also sharpen coucelle s bound , and show that for @xmath5 , the class of graphs of special treewidth at most @xmath2 is not closed under taking minors .",
    "the graph @xmath6 denotes the complete graph on four vertices , and the other five graphs are depicted in figure  [ fig : pw2 ] and figure  [ figure : forbidden ] .      to show this",
    ", we first prove that every block of special treewidth at most two must have pathwidth at most two .",
    "but it is not a sufficient condition for having special treewidth two , and we establish a precise condition how those blocks can be attached to obtain a graph of special treewidth two .",
    "we expect that similar characterizations are hard or impossible to obtain for values larger than two .",
    "for instance , we see in section  [ section : width3 ] that the classes of graphs of special treewidth , spaghetti treewidth , directed spaghetti treewidth , or strongly chordal treewidth at most @xmath2 , for @xmath1 are not closed under taking minors",
    ".    it may be interesting to pursue a similar investigation for parameters that are defined in a similar way by other subclasses of chordal graphs .",
    "bodlaender , kratsch and kreuzen  @xcite showed that special treewidth and spaghetti treewidth are fixed parameter tractable ; an adaptation of the algorithms by bodlaender and kloks @xcite or lagergren and arnborg @xcite gives linear time decision algorithms for each fixed bound on the width .",
    "we conjecture that in a similar way , it can be shown that directed spaghetti treewidth is fixed parameter tractable .",
    "whether strongly chordal treewidth is fixed parameter tractable , we leave as an open problem .",
