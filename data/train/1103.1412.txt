    ". such exact information could be useful in investigating whether the @xmath56 homomorphisms are equivalent .",
    "this precise knowledge is not necessary however to deduce corollary [ cheapcor ] , which follows immediately .",
    "observe that since by hypothesis @xmath59 is the unknot we have @xmath156 so that @xmath157 is an isomorphism .",
    "then the commutativity of the square involving both @xmath157 and @xmath158 tells us that @xmath158 restricted to the torsion part of @xmath159 is a surjection . therefore there exists a decomposition @xmath160 into free and torsion @xmath77$]-modules such that @xmath161 .",
    "but if @xmath162 then we must have @xmath163 , hence a contradiction .",
    "first of all we would like to see that @xmath164 , the torsion part of @xmath89 .",
    "this follows directly from the first row of the commutative diagram in theorem [ usefulseq ] and the fact that the map @xmath165 is onto the free part of @xmath166 . indeed ,",
    "if this map were not , we would either have a non - torsion part of @xmath167 or we would have @xmath168",
    ".          from the first diagram observe that @xmath171 since @xmath131 is non - torsion .",
    "this implies that @xmath172 by commutativity of the rightmost square .",
    "for the same reason in the second diagram we see @xmath173 , which implies that @xmath174 by the commutativity of the leftmost square .",
    "this means that each row gives rise to short exact sequences                we can copy the proof of theorem [ knotsfromu ] here . in fact , this situation is simpler since there is no torsion hence every short exact sequence splits .",
    "the one almost delicate point is to deduce that the map appearing in the top row commutative diagram in theorem [ usefulseq ]      is an injection .",
    "we know that it is an injection equivariantly and furthermore we have a description of the chain - homotopy type of the equivariant complex given in the discussion following the statement of theorem [ snunknot ] .",
    "so it follows that @xmath182 is an injection in the unreduced case which is obtained by setting @xmath183 in the equivariant chain complexes .",
    "the reduced case then follows from @xmath182 being an injection in the unreduced case and the generalized universal coefficients theorem for principal ideal domains .",
    "earlier we promised a discussion of the case when @xmath184 .",
    "notice that in this case our argument in the proof of theorem [ knotsfromu ] goes through as before for all @xmath185 except when @xmath186 .",
    "hence we can determine the homology groups of @xmath67 in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath70 except for @xmath187 .",
    "to fix the remaining homology group it suffices to know the image of the map @xmath188 .",
    "we do not give a proof of this fact since it is not needed for our main application of theorem [ knotsfromu ] .    to begin our proof of theorem [ noncomplete ]",
    ", we first collect a few results from the literature on hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "we state the first theorem not as strongly as thurston proved it , but strongly enough for us to use .",
    "[ hds ] let @xmath126 be a cusped hyperbolic @xmath61-manifold with a distinguished cusp .",
    "we write @xmath189 for the result of filling the distinguished cusp with filling coefficient @xmath190 .",
    "then @xmath189 is hyperbolic except for a finite set of filling slopes and @xmath189 converges to @xmath126 in the geometric topology as @xmath191 .     .",

    "2 .   for @xmath204 ,",
    "the link @xmath205 is distinct from the link @xmath206 .",
    "3 .   for any @xmath132",
    ", the result of @xmath207-surgery on @xmath194 turns @xmath195 into a smoothly slice knot @xmath198 , which is independent of @xmath132 .",
    "4 .   define the tangles @xmath196 as in figure [ tangle ] .",
    "each tangle @xmath196 is hyperbolic , as is the branched double cover of each @xmath196 .",
    "consider figure [ tangle ] , @xmath208 is an example of a _ simple _ tangle ( in other words prime and atoroidal ) .",
    "furthermore , we know by item ( 4 ) of theorem [ akio ] that @xmath196 ( the complement of @xmath208 ) is hyperbolic .",
    "we now write @xmath209 for the result of doing @xmath210-surgery on @xmath194 to the knot @xmath195 , so that @xmath211 for each @xmath132 . by item",
    "( 3 ) of theorem [ akio ] , we see that @xmath212 is the knot @xmath198 for each @xmath213 .",
    "since the complement of @xmath205 is atoroidal for each @xmath132 , theorem [ hds ] tells us that the complement of @xmath209 is hyperbolic for large enough @xmath138 and that these complements converge in the geometric topology to the complement of @xmath205 as @xmath214 .",
    "since the meridians of the @xmath209 converge to the meridian to @xmath195 , the sequence of knots @xmath209 determines the link complement to @xmath205 as well as the meridional curve to @xmath195 . by filling along the meridian and taking @xmath195 isotopic to any longitude relative to the meridian",
    ", we see this determines @xmath195 inside the solid torus complement to @xmath194 .",
    "since there is only one way to fill the boundary of this solid torus to get @xmath215 unknotted inside @xmath199 , we have determined the whole link @xmath205 .",
    "hence there exists an @xmath138 such that the complement to @xmath209 is not diffeomorphic to the complement to @xmath216 whenever @xmath204 . since the knot complement determines the knot , we know that for this @xmath138 we have @xmath217 whenever @xmath204 .",
    "this set @xmath218 will be the @xmath98 distinct knots we are required to exhibit .",
    "the branched double cover of @xmath209 is a dehn filling of the branched double cover of @xmath196 , with filling slope determined by @xmath138 .",
    "again , theorem [ hds ] inplies that for @xmath138 large enough , the branched double cover of @xmath209 is hyperbolic .",
    "we know that branched double covers of @xmath223-bridge knots are lens spaces , which are not hyperbolic . hence @xmath209 is not @xmath223-bridge .",
    "kawauchi used the theory of _ almost identical imitation _ to create knots @xmath198 with multiple unknotting sites @xcite . in the proof of theorem [ noncomplete ]",
    "we used these knots @xmath198 in an essential way to create distinct knots with isomorphic khovanov - rozansky knot homologies .",
    "if we wished to draw a diagram of such knots it would be necessary to understand in detail the theory of almost identical imitation .",
    "however , if one is prepared to work on a more _ ad hoc _ basis then it is easy to create examples of knots with isomorphic knot homologies .",
    "one such _ ad hoc _ construction is based on pure brunnian braids ( pure braids that become equivalent to a trivial braid when any strand is removed ) .",
    "we have drawn an example of such a braid ( on three strands ) in figure [ brunnian ] .    from the braid drawn in figure [ brunnian ] we obtain the tangle drawn in figure [ megaexample ] .",
    "this tangle can be completed to a knot by filling the slots @xmath224 with other tangles .",
    "we now abuse notation by referring to the tangle corresponding to the chain complex @xmath28 itself by @xmath28 .",
    "we denote by @xmath225 the knot obtained by filling @xmath226 with @xmath28 , @xmath227 with @xmath9 , and @xmath102 with @xmath10 , and denote by @xmath228 the knot obtained by filling @xmath226 with @xmath9 , @xmath227 with @xmath28 and @xmath102 with @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath229 , the unknot and that @xmath230 .",
    "furthermore since @xmath231 can be transformed into the unknot both by a positive - to - negative crossing change ( in place @xmath226 , say ) and by a negative - to - positive crossing change ( in place @xmath102 ) , we must have @xmath232 .",
    "the conway and the kinoshita - terasaka ( kt ) knots are the first ( measured by crossing number ) example of a pair of mutant knots . in @xcite mackaay and vaz use techniques given by rasmussen in @xcite in order to compute that all reduced khovanov - rozansky homologies of the conway and the kt knots agree .",
