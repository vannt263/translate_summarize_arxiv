    "this second behaviour was not found in @xcite for a vacuum brane .",
    "then , the inclusion of an induced gravity term on a dilatonic brane - world model with an exponential potential on the bulk allows inflation to take place in the negative branch , even if it does not for a vanishing induced gravity parameter ( for @xmath140 ) .",
    "this behaviour has some similarity with steep inflation @xcite , where high energy corrections to the friedmann equation in rs scenario @xcite permit an inflationary evolution of the brane with potentials too steep to sustain it in the standard 4d case , although the inflationary scenario introduced by copeland et al in @xcite is supported by an inflaton confined in the brane while in our model inflation on the brane is induced by a dilaton field on the bulk .",

    "the dilatonic potential is an exponential function of the bulk scalar field and the matter content of the brane is coupled to the dilaton field .",
    "we deduce the modified friedmann equation for the positive and negative branch ( which specifies the way the brane is embedded in the bulk ) , the junction condition for the scalar field across the brane and the energy balance on the brane .",

    "( [ + solution1])-([+solution ] ) ; i.e. the matter content of the brane is specified by the brane tension , for a flrw brane .    in the vacuum positive branch ,",
    "the brane tension is a growing function of the scale factor and , consequently , mimics the behaviour of a phantom energy component on the brane .",
    "this phantom - like behaviour is obtained without including a phantom fluid on the brane .",
    "in fact , the brane tension does not violate the null energy condition .",

    "there is a another solution which is a bouncing solution ( @xmath105 ) around a minimum non - vanishing scale factor .",
    "the brane faces a curvature singularity in its future evolution , where the hubble parameter , brane tension and scale factor diverge .",
    "the singularity happens in an infinite cosmic time .",
    "therefore , the singularity can be interpreted as a `` big rip '' singularity pushed towards an infinite future cosmic time .    in the vacuum negative branch ,",
    "the brane tension is a decreasing function of the scale factor . unlike the positive branch ,",

    "it remains to be seen how the results obtained in this paper are modified when the brane has matter contents in addition to the brane tension . on the other hand ,",
