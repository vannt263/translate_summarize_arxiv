    "_ @xcite have presented a surprisingly conventional superconducting energy gap with a medium coupling equal to 2@xmath18 .",
    "the recent data of yates _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained on the 45 k ndfeaso@xmath19 show also an indication of the superconducting energy gap with 2@xmath20 .    in the following",
    "we present the systematic pcar studies on the ndfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 polycrystals indicating a two - gap @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the system . in the conductance",
    "spectra the smaller gap is pronounced in the form of two peaks positioned symmetrically at @xmath21 mv while the large one is revealed at the humps at about @xmath22 mv . in some cases",
    "the point - contact spectra show no signature of enhanced conductance due to the andreev reflection of quasiparticles on the superconducting energy gap . in this case",
    "just a reduced conductance near the zero - bias voltage is observed persisting even well above the bulk transition temperature .",
    "this indicates a presence of the pseudogap in the system .",
    "surprisingly , the gap features disappear from the spectra already at @xmath23 k , much below the particular @xmath4 of the junction under study . at @xmath5",
    "the spectrum is reduced to a zero - bias peak with intensity sometimes significantly higher than the conductance signal at lower temperatures .",
    "possible reasons for this temperature behavior are discussed .",
    "samples with a nominal composition ndfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 have been prepared by the high pressure synthesis in a cubic , multianvil apparatus , with an edge length of 19 mm from rockland research corporation .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of ndfe@xmath24as@xmath24 , nd@xmath10o@xmath24 , ndf@xmath24 and nd were pressed into a pellet with mass of approximately 0.5 g and placed inside of a bn crucible with an inner diameter of 5.5 mm . the synthesis was carried out at about 3.3 gpa .",
    "the temperature was increased over a period of one hour to 1350 - 1400 @xmath25c and held for 8 hours before being quenched to room temperature .",
    "the pressure was then released and the sample removed mechanically . more details of the synthesis and characterization will be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the value of 10% f substitution is nominal , based on the initial stoichiometry of the pellet .",
    "the synthesis yields polycrystalline ndfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 samples that contain what appears to be plate - like single crystals as large as 300 @xmath26 m @xcite . whereas extraction of these crystallites is difficult , we could measure properties of individual crystals by using local point - contact probe with a metallic tip .    the point - contact andreev - reflection ( pcar ) measurements have been realized via the standard lock - in technique in a special point - contact approaching system with lateral and vertical movements of the pc tip by a differential screw mechanism .",
    "the microconstrictions were prepared in situ by pressing different metallic tips ( copper and platinum formed either mechanically or by electrochemical etching ) on different parts of the freshly polished surface of the superconductor .",
    "typical dimension of the microconstriction formed by such method is usually on the order of tens of nanometers .",
    "@xmath4 s have been determined from the resistive transitions and also from the temperature dependences of the point - contact spectra .",
    "while onset of the transition to the zero - resistance state was at 51 k the transition temperatures found by the point - contact technique varied between 45 and 51 k.    the point - contact spectrum measured on the ballistic microconstriction between a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor ( s ) consist of the andreev reflection ( ar ) contribution and the tunneling contribution @xcite .",
    "the charge transfer through a barrierless metallic point contact is realized via the andreev reflection of carriers .",
    "consequently at @xmath27 the pc current as well as the pc conductance inside the gap voltage ( @xmath28 ) is twice higher than the respective values at higher energies ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the presence of the tunneling barrier reduces the conductance at the zero bias and two symmetrically located peaks rise at the gap energy .",
    "the evolution of the point - contact spectra between the pure andreev reflection and the giaever - like tunneling has been theoretically described by the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) theory @xcite for the case of @xmath2-wave superconductors .",
    "the point - contact conductance data can be compared with this theory using as input parameters the energy gap @xmath30 , the parameter @xmath31 ( measure for the strength of the interface barrier ) and a parameter @xmath8 for the spectral broadening @xcite . in any case",
    "the voltage dependence of the n / s point - contact conductance gives direct spectroscopic information on the superconducting order parameter @xmath30 . for a multiband / multigap superconductor",
    "the point - contact conductance @xmath32 can be expressed as a weighted sum of partial btk conductances . as shown in our previous work @xcite in case of mgb@xmath10",
    "the total pcar conductance could be simply summarized from two contributions of band 1 and 2 ( the 3d @xmath33-band with a small gap @xmath34 and the quasi two - dimensional @xmath35-band with a large gap @xmath36 , respectively ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the weight factor for the @xmath39 - band contribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite have extended the btk formulation also for unconventional pairing ( @xmath15-wave or @xmath16-wave ) .",
    "before evaluating the point - contact spectra precautions have to be made that the heating effects are avoided and the junction is in a ballistic or spectroscopic regime .",
    "one way is to evaluate the contact size and check if it is smaller compared to the quasiparticle mean free path in the normal as well as in the superconducting electrodes and superconducting coherence length .",
    "even if the bulk resistivities of the tip and the sample are known ( which is not the case for our ndfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 ) the local resistivity at the point - contact area can be significantly enhanced due to a pressure of the tip on the sample . then , the evaluation of the contact size and the quasiparticle mean free path becomes problematic .",
    "moreover very often multiple parallel contacts are formed .",
    "that is why inspection of typical heating effects is usually used to determine whether the spectroscopic regime is established in the junction . in the following",
    "we present the data where the heating effects , as sharp conductance dips and irreversibilities in the conductance curves usually observed at low voltages , are absent .",
    "moreover , we have focused on the junctions with important tunneling component indicated by the interface barrier - strength parameter @xmath40 .",
    "figure 1 shows a variety of the pcar spectra obtained on the junctions made by pt tip on the ndfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 polycrystalline samples at 4.3 k ( solid lines ) .",
    "the spectra labeled as a , b , c and d have been normalized to their particular normal - state conductances measured above @xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum e was just divided by its own value at 60 mv . for the sake of clarity the lower curves",
    "are vertically shifted . as can be seen the spectra show a pair of the gap - like peaks symmetrically placed at @xmath41 mv (",
    "the curves a , b and c ) or at @xmath42 mv in the case of the spectrum d. in the spectra a , b and c also a reproducible shoulder near @xmath43 10 mv and some smaller structures with much less reproducibility are revealed .",
    "location of the gap - like peaks / humps is indicative for a size of the related gap but precise determination of the gap is not possible in this way .",
    "for example in the case of important spectral broadening , typically found in samples of new and in addition nonstoichiometric materials , the gap - like peaks can be pushed to significantly higher voltages than would correspond to a real size of the gap .",
    "another uncertainty can be caused by a way of normalization of the spectra , etc .",
    "one way to partly overcome this troubles is to compare the measured data to the appropriate model . in the following the spectra showing apparent enhanced conductance and the gap - like peaks ( both features indicating the andreev reflection of quasiparticles on the superconducting energy gap )",
    "have been fitted to the btk single - gap formula .",
    "the resulting fits except for the curve d were poor and unable to reproduce the measured curves .",
    "the failure did not concern only the humps at about 10 mv but also the overall width of the enhanced conductance around the zero - bias was impossible to achieve .",
    "then , in the case of the spectra a , b , and c we proceeded to the two - gap btk model mentioned above . as can be seen from the curves indicated by the open circles in fig .",
    "1 , the two gap @xmath2-wave btk formula represents a good fit to the data .",
    "we remark that even if the two - gap model describes our spectra measured at @xmath44 = 4.3 k quite well , small deviations occur at higher voltages above @xmath45 value .",
    "the following fitting parameters have been obtained : a - @xmath46 = 5 mev , @xmath45 = 12 mev .",
    "b - @xmath46 = 5.2 mev , @xmath45 = 10 mev .",
    "c - @xmath46 = 5 mev , @xmath45 = 12 mev .",
    "the smearing parameters @xmath47 vary but they have always been in the range @xmath48 of the respective gap value .",
    "the weight factor @xmath49 for contribution of the band 1 with a smaller gap @xmath46 has been scattered between 0.4 and 0.6 . in the case of the spectrum",
    "d the fit by the single - gap formula was possible yielding @xmath50 mev with a significant large smearing @xmath51 mev .",
    "the barrier strength parameter @xmath31 has been found between 0.3 and 0.5 in the case of the curves a , b , c and d as well as in the case of the junctions with the similar gap - like spectra .",
    "the particular transition temperature of the junctions a , b , c and d was very close to 45 k. it is documented by the temperature dependence of the spectrum b displayed in fig .",
    "3a , where the enhanced conductance around zero bias is completely gone at this temperature . taking a value of @xmath52 k",
    "the following superconducting coupling strengths are obtained from the junction a , b and c : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , a weak coupling below the canonical bcs single - band value is found in the band 1 with the small gap and a strong coupling is characteristic for the second band . in the case of the junction",
    "d the coupling strength is even smaller with @xmath55 indicating that probably the information is not complete .    inspecting the data obtained on numerous junctions revealing the gap - like features",
    "has shown that the values of the small gap @xmath46 vary between 4 and 6 mev and for the large one @xmath45 between 9 and 13 mev .",
    "f@xmath7 measured at 4.3 k - solid lines .",
    "the lower spectra are vertically shifted for the clarity .",
    "open symbols represent fitting curves to the @xmath2-wave two - band btk model.,width=7 ]    .",

    "the lower spectra are vertically shifted .",
    "the insets show details of an unusual evolution of the spectra at lower temperatures ( see the text ) .",
    "the spectrum displayed in 3a is the same as the curve b in fig .",
    "1.,width=6 ]    quite a few of the measured spectra revealed a behavior indicated at the spectrum e in fig .",
    "these spectra have shown neither enhanced point - contact conductance nor coherence peaks , the both effects indicating the andreev reflection of quasiparticles on the superconducting energy gap but they have rather displayed a reduced conductance around the zero - bias voltage .    in fig .",
    "2 the effect of temperature on another junction with tunneling - like characteristics is shown .",
    "one can notice that the effect of the reduced conductance persists well above the bulk transition temperature @xmath56 45 k. it is better observable from the _ zbc versus temperature _ dependence shown in the inset of fig .",
    "then , the conclusion can be made that this tunneling - like feature can not be connected with the superconductivity in the system but reminds a reduced density of states of the normal quasiparticles or pseudogap observed in the underdoped high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "since the measurements have been done on polycrystals one can only speculate if the tunneling - like conductance characteristics are related to a specific direction of the point - contact current with respect to the crystallographic orientation of the sample . in this line",
    "it is worth noticing that very recently we have observed this kind of characteristics on the single crystals of ( ba , k)fe@xmath10as@xmath10 when the point - contact current was oriented in the @xmath57 crystallographic direction , while the spectra with two superconducting gaps were observed in the @xmath58 planes @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3a and 3b the temperature dependence of the spectra showing the superconducting gap - like features is shown .",
    "the presented curves are in fact the raw data just normalized to their values at voltage @xmath59 = 40 mv .",
    "the lower curves are shifted for clarity .",
    "similarly to all others of the numerous spectra we have measured , the spectral backgrounds reveal a small asymmetry , being higher at negative bias voltage , i.e. when the electrons are injected from the tip into the superconductor .",
    "this asymmetry is revealed also in the spectra with a tunneling - like character as those displayed in fig .",
    "this feature revealed also above @xmath4 is in agreement with the measurements of chen et al .",
    "one possible explanation can be that the asymmetry is due to energy dependent dos in the normal state .",
    "the both sets of spectra in fig .",
    "3 reveal at 4.3 k two symmetrically placed gap - like peaks at @xmath60 mv and humps at @xmath61 mv and higher voltage .",
    "the effect of temperature is very unusual .",
    "namely , while the position of the gap - like peaks is rapidly shrinking with increasing temperature , surprisingly the intensity of the conductance spectrum near the zero - bias voltage increases .",
    "the latter effect is better presented in the insets , where the curves are not vertically shifted . above 10",
    "k the only visible feature of the spectrum 3a is the narrow zbc peak which at even higher temperatures looses its intensity and vanishes at the local @xmath4 , here at about 45 k. in the second set of the spectra shown in fig .",
    "3b the zbc peak appears already at @xmath44 = 10 k and coexists with the gap - like peaks up to @xmath44 = 20 k. if one looks to the evolution of the spectrum from higher to lower temperatures , it seems that below @xmath4 the peak in conductance at zero bias is evolving and at certain transition temperature @xmath5 a gap is opening on this central conductance maximum .",
    "we remark that the temperature @xmath5 where the gap - like peaks are replaced by the zero - bias maximum is not always the same but depends on the strength of the interface barrier @xmath31 .",
    "the higher @xmath31 , the higher temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this finding is consistent with a behavior of the point - contact junctions on smfeaso@xmath19f@xmath62 as presented in fig . 2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "co - presence of the gap - like peaks and the zero - bias peak has also been found in ref.@xcite . there , in fig . 1",
    "one can moreover notice that , similarly to our observations , the hight of the zbc peak at 32 k is larger than the zero - bias conductance at 5.2 k.    what could be an explanation of the observed zbc peak in the pcar spectra ?",
    "indeed there is an analogy with cuprates where it is connected with the nodal superconducting energy gap or the order parameter phase sign changing along the ( 110 ) surface . for the iron",
    "pnictides mazin and coworkers @xcite suggested two @xmath2-wave gaps on disconnected fermi surface sheets but with opposite sign .",
    "recently , choi and bang @xcite have adopted this model of `` @xmath63 '' pairing ( @xmath2-wave order parameter with sign reversal ) in analogy with a behavior of the superconducting / ferromagnet ( s / f ) bilayers where also the order parameter sign change can happen .",
    "their calculations show that in the case of the two - band system the superconductivity is possible even for a negative pairing interaction by generating the sign reversal between the gaps @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "one of the consequencies of the @xmath63 state is that one gap is smaller and another one larger than the bcs weak coupling value .",
    "the calculations have also shown that @xmath63 state can produce the zero - bias peak in the local density of states at the superconducting / normal interface .",
    "this can be detected in the tunneling or pcar spectroscopy measured on the normal metal / superconductor junctions .",
    "specific conditions enabling observations the zbc peak must be studied in details to explain why this effect would be appear only at higher temperatures .",
    "but it is noteworthy that the zbc peak effect is observed in the all pcar tunneling data available so far @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the presence of the zbc peak in the point - contact spectrum could be just a fingerprint of the local destruction of superconductivity , i.e the point contact would rather be in a thermal than in spectroscopic regime .",
    "obviously , even the point contact revealing spectroscopic features in the form of gap - like peaks at low temperatures could be driven out of the spectroscopic regime by higher temperatures and/or higher voltages .",
    "this is due to the fact that a mean free path of the quasiparticles is shortened at higher temperatures / voltages .",
    "this scenario seems to contradict the behavior seen in fig .",
    "3b , where the zbc peak is accompanied by a presence of the gap - like peaks at 10 and 15 k. the higher voltage can not redirect the junction back into the spectroscopic regime .",
    "it means that once the junction is in the thermal regime at voltages near the zero bias it can not show up such a pronounced gap - like peaks at higher voltages .",
    "but we can not completely rule out this behavior in the case of parallel junctions where one would be very close to a thermal regime at low temperatures .",
    "in any case the unusual development of the spectra with temperature has prevented reasonable fits of the spectra taken at higher temperatures to the btk formalism where the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath38 should be kept constant once obtained from the fit to the data measured at the lowest temperature .",
    "due to presence of magnetism in the parent compound and/or magnetic impurities ( fe , nd ) possibly present in the sample also the kondo scattering must be considered @xcite .",
    "the conductance minimum ( or resistance maximum ) around zero - bias voltage can be caused in principle also by the kondo effect .",
    "its appearance in the spectrum can be tested by magnetic field . in increasing field",
    "the zero - bias - conductance peak should appear due to the zeeman splitting of degenerate spin states .",
    "figure 4 presenting a behavior of the junction shown already in fig .",
    "3a , now in magnetic field up to 4 tesla excludes the presence of this effect .",
    "as can be seen in the figure the gap - like peaks ( @xmath66 ) and humps attributed to the large gap @xmath45 are suppressed in a standard way as expected for the s / n junction with the superconductor s in the mixed state .",
    "it is because in this spatially inhomogeneous situation a full distribution of the order parameters stretching from zero at the vortex cores up to a maximal value determined by maximal internal field @xmath67 between the vortices is found .    in the following",
    "we show that at least part of the unusual features found in the point - contact junctions here and also by other authors on the iron pnictides can be ascribed to the fact that parallel conductance channels are realized by point - contact junctions on the polycrystalline samples . in fig .",
    "5 an effect of the superposition of two parallel junctions , one with the two - gap spectrum and another showing the tunneling - like conductance , is presented .",
    "the two - gap spectrum ( btk ) has been generated by the two - gap btk formula with @xmath68 mev , @xmath69 mev , @xmath70 1 mev , @xmath71 2 mev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 0.5 .",
    "the tunneling - like spectra ( experimental ) are taken from experiment .",
    "the sum of these two spectra taken with equal weight is shown in fig . 5b .",
    "although not all details of the temperature evolution of the spectrum shown in fig . 3a are reproduced one can notice that the conductance spectrum near the zero - bias voltage is increasing with the temperature up to 20 k followed by its decrease at higher temperatures .",
    "it means that the unusual increasing intensity of the pcar spectrum with increasing temperature has not been necessarily connected with unconventional superconductivity in the system .    in fig .",
    "5c the spectrum presented in fig .",
    "3b at 4.3 k is reproduced after normalization to its high - voltage background ( curve a ) .",
    "the normalized spectrum was impossible to fit by the btk formalism .",
    "let us consider again a parallel connection of two junctions , one with a two - gap spectrum and another with a tunneling - like character .",
    "be the junction a represents the sum of these two . in fig .",
    "5c the conductance of the tunneling - like junction ( curve b ) was subtracted with a proper weight ( 0.5 ) from the conductance of the junction a. the resulting spectrum is indicated by the curve c. the spectrum c could be well fitted by the two - gap btk formula .",
    "the circles represent this fit with @xmath74 mev , @xmath75 mev , @xmath70 1.35 mev , @xmath71 6 mev and @xmath73 0.5 . using this simple model we have arrived to the two superconducting gaps which are consistent with those found on the junctions a , b and c presented in fig",
