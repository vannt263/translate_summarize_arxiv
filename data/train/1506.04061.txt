    "coherent vortices still have no universal definition in fluid mechanics , but two main features of a possible definition have been emerging .",
    "first , vortices are broadly agreed to be concentrated regions of high vorticity .",
    "some authors require this dominance of vorticity relative to other flow domains ( mcwilliams 1984 , hussein 1986 ) , others expect it relative to the strain in the same domain ( okubo 1970 , hunt et al .",
    "1988 , weiss 1991 , hua & klein 1998 , hua , mcwilliams & klein 1998 ) .",
    "yet others compare vorticity to strain in the rate - of - strain eigenbasis ( tabor & klapper 1995 ; see also lapeyre , klein & hua 1999 , and lapeyre , hua & legras 2001 ) .",
    "second , vortices are generally viewed as evolving domains with a high degree of material invariance .",
    "lugt ( 1979 ) writes that a vortex is a `` multitude of material particles rotating around a common center '' .",
    "mcwilliams ( 1984 ) expects the vortex to `` persist under passive advection by the large - scale flow '' .",
    "chong , perry & cantwell ( 1990 ) propose to capture vortices by finding spiraling particle motions in the frozen - time limit of the flow .",
    "vortices are described as `` highly impermeable to inward and outward particle fluxes '' by provenzale ( 1999 ) , who requires small relative dispersion within vortex cores ( see also cucitore quadrio & baron 1999 ) .",
    "chakraborty , balachandar & adrian ( 2005 ) proposes that both swirling motion and small particle separation should be distinguishing features of a vortex core .",
    "haller ( 2005 ) views vortices as sets of trajectories with a persistent lack of lagrangian hyperbolicity .",
    "chelton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) observe that nonlinear eddies ( vortices with a rotation speed exceeding their translation speed ) trap fluid in their interior and transport them along . finally , in a similar",
    "geophysical setting , mason , pascual & mcwilliams ( 2014 ) stress that vortices are `` efficient carriers of mass and its physical , chemical , and biological properties '' .",
    "the core of a coherent vortex is , therefore , broadly expected to be an impermeable material region marked by a high concentration of vorticity .",
    "what constitutes high vorticity is , however , subject to individual judgement , thresholding , and choice of the reference frame .",
    "it is therefore the material invariance of a vortex core that holds more promise as a first requirement in an unambiguous vortex definition .",
    "indeed , the lagrangian nature of a vortex can simply be assured by defining its boundary as a tubular ( i.e. , cylindrical , cup - shaped or toroidal ) material surface .",
    "the challenging next step is then to select such a material surface in a way that it also encloses a region of concentrated vorticity .    unlike vorticity ,",
    "materially defined vortex boundary surfaces are inherently frame - invariant , defined by a set of fluid trajectories rather than by coordinates or instantaneous scalar field values . in continuum",
    "mechanics terminology , a material vortex boundary must therefore be objective , i.e. , invariant with respect to all euclidean frame changes of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote coordinates in the original and in the transformed frame , respectively ; @xmath3 is an arbitrary rotation matrix ; and @xmath4 is an arbitrary translation vector ( truesdell & noll 1965 ) .",
    "paradoxically , with the exception of the approach initiated by tabor & klapper ( 1995 ) , none of the instantaneous eulerian vortex criteria listed above are objective .",
    "accordingly , they may only detect coherent structures after passage to an appropriately rotating or translating coordinate frame .",
    "for instance , the unsteady navier - stokes velocity field @xmath5    is classified as a vortex by the okubo  weiss , hua  klein , hua  mcwilliams  klein , and chakraborty ",
    "balachandar  adrian criteria , as well as by the @xmath6-criterion of hunt et al .",
    ", the @xmath7-criterion of chong , perry and cantwell , and the nonlinear eddy criterion of chelton et al . in reality , is a rotating saddle - point flow , with typical trajectories growing exponentially in norm .",
    "this instability , however , only becomes detectable to these criteria after one passes to an appropriately chosen rotating frame ( haller 2005 , 2015 ) .",
    "promisingly , if we simply impose the localized high - vorticity requirement , the constant - vorticity flow is immediately discounted as a vortex without further need for analysis .",
    "selecting vortex boundaries as material surfaces ensures material invariance for the vortex , but any tubular material surface can a priori be considered for this purpose .",
    "recent stretching - based variational approaches narrow down this consideration to exceptional material tubes that remain perfectly unfilamented under material advection ( haller & beron ",
    "vera 2013 , blazevski & haller 2004 , haller 2015 ) . as an alternative ,",
    "farazmand & haller ( 2016 ) seek vortex boundaries as maximal material tubes along which material elements complete the same polar rotation over a finite time interval of interest .",
    "these approaches have proven effective in two - dimensional flows .",
    "they , however , rely on a precise computation of the invariants of the cauchy  green strain tensor along a lagrangian grid , which requires the accurate numerical differentiation of trajectories with respect to their initial positions .",
    "this presents a challenge in three - dimensional unsteady flows , for which the polar rotation approach additionally fails to be objective .",
    "most importantly , however , lagrangian strain - based approaches offer no link between material vortices and the expected high vorticity concentration , a defining feature of observed vortices .    in summary , despite recent advances in vortex criteria and fluid trajectory stability analysis , a fully three - dimensional , computationally tractable and objective global vortex definition , with guaranteed material invariance and experimentally observable rotational coherence , has not yet emerged .",
    "here we propose such a vortex definition and a corresponding vortex detection technique .",
    "our approach is based on a recently obtained , unique decomposition of the deformation gradient into the product the two deformation gradients : one for a purely straining flow and one for a purely rotational flow ( haller 2016 ) .",
    "this rotational deformation gradient , the dynamic rotation tensor , obeys the temporal superposition property of rigid body rotations , thereby eliminating a dynamical inconsistency of the classic polar rotation tensor used in classical continuum mechanics .",
    "the dynamic rotation tensor can further be factorized into a spatial mean - rotation component and a deviation from this rotation .",
    "the latter deviatory part yields an objective , intrinsic material rotational angle relative to the deforming fluid mass .",
    "we then define a rotationally coherent lagrangian vortex as a nested set of material tubes , each exhibiting uniform intrinsic material rotation .",
    "such a vortex turns out to be foliated by outward decreasing tubular level sets of the lagrangian - averaged vorticity ( lavd ) .",
    "additionally , we prove that the center of an lavd - based vortex is always the observed attractor for nearby finite - size ( inertial ) particle motions in geostrophic flows .    in the limit of zero advection time , our lagrangian vortex definition turns into an objective eulerian vortex definition : a set of tubular surfaces of equal intrinsic rotation rate .",
    "these surfaces are tubular level sets of the instantaneous vorticity deviation ( ivd ) , providing a mathematical link between rotationally coherent eulerian and lagrangian vortices : the former are effectively derivatives of the latter .",
    "we illustrate our results on several examples , ranging from analytic velocity fields to time - dependent two- and three - dimensional models and observational data .",
    "we consider an unsteady velocity field @xmath8 , defined on a possibly time - dependent spatial domain @xmath9 over a finite time interval @xmath10.$ ] we assume that @xmath11 is invariant under the fluid flow generated by the velocity field ( cf .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is either a physical domain with an impermeable boundary , or @xmath11 is a material domain formed by a set of evolving trajectories of @xmath8 .",
    "we write the velocity gradient @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14^{t}\\right)$ ] is the rate of stain tensor and @xmath15^{t}\\right)$ ] is the spin tensor .",
    "we recall that the vorticity @xmath16 of the fluid satisfies @xmath17 we will also use the instantaneous spatial mean @xmath18 of the vorticity over @xmath11 , defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the volume for three - dimensional flows , and the area for two - dimensional flows .",
    "accordingly , @xmath21 refers to the volume or area element , respectively , in @xmath11 .    under general observer changes of the form , the spin tensor and the vorticity in the new @xmath22 coordinate frame take the form @xmath23 with the vector @xmath24 defined uniquely by the relation @xmath25 for all @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , truesdell & rajagopal 2009 ) .",
    "formula shows that the spin tensor and the vorticity are not objective quantities : the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath27 change in rotating frames , and so does the direction and the magnitude of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , neither @xmath27 nor @xmath28 is , by itself , suitable for defining distinguished _ material _ sets in the flow .",
    "this is because material sets are tied to evolving fluid particles without any reference to coordinates , and hence are inherently frame - invariant .",
    "more generally statements about the material response of a moving continuum can not depend on the observer and hence should be objective ( gurtin 1982 ) .",
    "fluid particle trajectories generated by @xmath8 are solutions of the differential equation @xmath29 defining the flow map    @xmath30,\\label{eq : flow map}\\ ] ]    as the mapping from initial particle positions @xmath31 to their later positions @xmath32 .",
    "the assumed invariance of @xmath11 over the time interval @xmath10 $ ] can now be conveniently expressed as @xmath33.\\label{eq : invariance_of_u}\\ ] ]    we will also use the notion of a _ material surface _ , which is a smooth , codimension - one , time - dependent surface family @xmath34 advected by the flow , i.e. , @xmath35.$ ]    the deformation gradient @xmath36 is a linear map , taking initial infinitesimal perturbations to the fluid trajectory @xmath37 at time @xmath38 to their later positions at time @xmath39 . although often believed otherwise , @xmath40 is _ not _ objective : its eigenvectors and eigenvalues depend on the frame of reference ( see , e.g. , liu 2004 )",
    ". therefore , the invariants of @xmath40 do not provide an objective indication of the rotational component of the deformation .",
    "we seek to identify coherent lagrangian vortices as the union of tubular material surfaces in which fluid elements exhibit the same bulk material rotation over a finite time interval of interest . individual material fibers based at an initial point @xmath41 in a deforming continuum , however , all rotate around different axes and by different angles . in recent work (",
    "farazmand & haller 2016 ) , we used the classic polar rotation angle ( pra ) from finite strain theory to identify pointwise bulk material rotation in a moving fluid systematically .",
    "the use of the pra , however , also leaves several challenges unaddressed , as we discuss in appendix a. most notable of these are an inconsistency of the pra with experimentally observed dynamic rotation angles of spherical tracers in fluids , and its lack of objectivity in three dimensions .    to address these challenges ,",
    "we use here the recently developed _",
    "dynamic polar decomposition _ ( dpd ) to identify a dynamically consistent and fully frame - invariant rotational component in the finite deformation of fluid elements ( haller 2016 ) .",
    "this decomposition gives a unique , time - evolving factorization of the deformation gradient into the product of two deformation gradients : one for a purely rotational flow with zero rate of strain , and one for a purely straining flow with zero vorticity .",
    "specifically , the unique right dpd of @xmath40 at @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42,\\label{eq : dpd-1}\\ ] ] where the proper orthogonal _",

    "similarly , the linear velocity field for @xmath48 in is irrotational because its coefficient matrix @xmath49 is symmetric . unlike the classic polar rotation tensor ( cf . appendix",
    "a ) , the dynamic rotation tensor @xmath50 is _ dynamically consistent _ , i.e. , satisfies the fundamental superposition property of solid - body rotations : @xmath51.\\label{eq : groups}\\ ] ] this follows because @xmath50 is the fundamental matrix solution of a classical linear differential equation and hence satisfies the process property noted in ( cf .",
    "dafermos 1971 , arnold 1978 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath52 is the fundamental matrix solution of a non - classical linear differential equation with memory , i.e. , with explicit dependence on the initial time @xmath38 .",
    "such fundamental solutions do not obey the process - property indicated in .",
    "the reason behind the dynamical inconsistency of polar rotations is a similar memory effect in eq . .",
    "the decomposition in is a right - type decomposition , i.e. , the dynamic stretch tensor precedes the dynamic rotation tensor from the right .",
    "just as for the classic polar decomposition , a left - type version of the dpd is also available ( haller 2016 ) .",
    "despite its dynamical consistency , the dynamic rotation tensor @xmath50 is not objective .",
    "its frame - dependence is the consequence of the frame - dependence of the spin tensor @xmath53 appearing in the differential equation",
    ". the single remaining challenge out of those listed in appendix a is , therefore , to identify an objective part of the rotation described by @xmath50 which also preserves the dynamical consistency of @xmath50 . below we recall further results from haller ( 2016 ) , and use them to address this challenge .    the dynamic rotation tensor @xmath50 can further be factorized into two deformation gradients : one for a spatially uniformly rotating flow , and one for a flow that describes deviations from this uniform rotation . specifically , we have @xmath54 where the proper orthogonal _ relative rotation tensor _",

    "for detailed proofs of all statements in theorem 1 , we refer the reader to haller ( 2016 ) .",
    "importantly , this theorem enables the extraction of an objective and dynamically consistent , material rotation component from the deformation gradient without carrying out the differentiation with respect to initial conditions in the definition of @xmath40 .",
    "we now use the lavd to identify objectively material tubes along which small fluid volumes experience the same bulk rotation over @xmath10 $ ] relative to the mean rigid - body rotation of the fluid . by theorem 1 ,",
    "the time @xmath38 positions of such material tubes are tubular level surfaces of the scalar function @xmath73 . by a _ tubular set _ , we mean here a convex , cylindrical , cup - shaped or toroidal set in three dimensions , and a closed convex curve in two dimensions .",
