    "accelerator - based neutrino long baseline experiments have recently entered an era wherein oscillation measurements using antineutrino exposures are being undertaken . since",
    "previous experimental investigations have been have based in the main on neutrino beam exposures , the on - going and next - round explorations using antineutrino reactions will provide a crucial complementary perspective on oscillation phenomena .",
    "the question naturally arises as to whether standard phenomenology , describing mixing among either two or three of active flavor neutrinos and without or with inclusion of the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effect @xcite , provides an adequate framework  or whether a more expansive formalism is required . in this work",
    "we investigate a matter effect scenario which is based upon a specific neutrino non - standard interaction ( nsi ) which we identify as highly promising for generating distinctive observable effects in the neutrino  atmospheric \" @xmath10-@xmath11 flavor mixing sector .",
    "impetus for this paper arises in part from observations of muon - neutrino flavor disappearance for @xmath12 and for @xmath13 obtained by the minos experiment . as recently reported @xcite , minos infers the value for @xmath7 governing @xmath2 oscillations at @xmath9 to be somewhat higher than the value gleaned from @xmath3 disappearance .",
    "the new observations are in line with the minos low statistics result of last year , in which @xmath12 survival was examined using antineutrino ( background ) reactions isolated in exposures with neutrino beams  @xcite . while the earlier observation was of poor statistical significance , it attracted attention as a possible harbinger of new physics , e.g. of cpt violation in the neutrino sector  @xcite , or of new interactions with matter - driven mixing to a sterile neutrino  @xcite , or of an nsi matter effect  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief summary in sec .",
    "ii of salient points from the literature on nsi matter effects as they pertain to neutrino oscillations . in sec .",
    "iii we then specify the neutrino oscillation phenomenology which follows from existence of a single nsi matter potential @xmath1 , proposed to exist in addition to the msw matter effect .",
    "the latter , well - known matter potential is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fermi constant , and @xmath16 is the electron number density averaged over the neutrino path through the earth .",
    "this sets the stage for discussion of certain remarkable implications for experiments in sec .",
    "our formalism applies most directly to neutrino traversal of the earth s crust , and we use recent results from the minos long baseline experiment to illustrate such an application .",
    "we proceed to show that a real - valued @xmath6 in conjunction with a single @xmath5 and with a single mixing angle @xmath17 provides a satisfactory description for the minos antineutrino and neutrino beam data currently available . in sec .",
    "v we relate our formalism to neutrino traversal of the earth s mantle , and identify effects of relevance to measurements using atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "section vi concludes the paper with mention of near - future experimental developments which can shed light on the existence of @xmath6 , and on other new physics mechanisms which also have capability to differentiate @xmath2 from @xmath3 oscillations .",
    "under the hypothesis that neutrinos participate in heretofore unobserved non - standard interactions , the neutrino flavor hamiltonian will carry new potential terms analogous to the msw potential .",
    "the latter potential accounts for coherent forward scattering of electron - flavor neutrinos from the electrons within a field of matter .",
    "possibilities for the underlying neutrino scattering processes include both flavor - changing and flavor - conserving nsi .",
    "there are six possible nsi amplitudes which can arise in neutrino propagation through matter , conventionally designated as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath6 , and @xmath22 .",
    "cp - violating effects are possible in the event that the amplitudes carry phases .",
    "the effects which may arise from various combinations of @xmath23 have received extensive treatment in the literature ; recent summaries with relevant references can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for oscillation survival probabilities of the @xmath24 sector of interest here",
    ", direct contributions may arise from the three potentials  @xmath25 ,  @xmath26 , and  @xmath27 . in a recent evaluation of model - independent bounds on production and detection of neutrino nsi",
    "it was found that @xmath28 , whereas @xmath29 and @xmath22 is even less constrained  @xcite .",
    "we note that limits on @xmath30 and @xmath31 based on solar and kamland neutrino data are reported from an analysis which restricts to neutrino nsi with electrons ( but not with u or d quarks )  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we neglect the flavor - conserving nsi and focus on @xmath32 as the single nsi capable of producing significant differences in @xmath2 versus @xmath3 oscillations in long - baseline experiments .",
    "the extraordinary role that @xmath6 can play in distinguishing @xmath2 from @xmath3 oscillations has received little direct discussion in the literature to date .",
    "this circumstance reflects in part a dearth of sufficient experimental information to motivate nsi expositions to get down to specifics .",
    "however a recent work has discussed a somewhat analogous role for the @xmath20 nsi ( of magnitude @xmath3310@xmath34 ) with explaining discordant @xmath35 values inferred from solar ( electron ) neutrinos versus kamland ( electron ) antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "a two - flavor neutrino mixing framework is an adequate venue for examination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 propagation in the constant - density terrestrial crust , and we invoke such a framework in sec .",
    "it has been argued , on the basis of fitting using the two - flavor mixing framework to superkamiokande and macro atmospheric ( @xmath3 + @xmath2 ) data , that the trend of muon - flavor survival at high energies and for global baselines constrains @xmath36 to be a few percent or less @xcite . for neutrino and antineutrino",
    "propagation over globe - spanning baselines however , there are complications .",
    "conventional three - flavor oscillations requires treatment of the different matter densities of the crust , mantle , and core , with the msw resonances of the mantle and core coming into play . with inclusion of nsi",
    "matter effects into the  mix \" , e.g. @xmath20 as well as @xmath37 , significant new degrees of freedom become available which can couple to ones neglected in a two - flavor mixing framework .",
    "it has been demonstrated for @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 , that nsi bounds derived from atmospheric neutrinos via two - flavor analysis become relaxed when @xmath38 mixing is included  @xcite .",
    "the possibility also remains that a similar outcome would ensue in a full three - flavor analysis extending to @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the verity of stringent @xmath6 bounds obtained using the two - flavor mixing framework for atmospheric neutrinos has been called into question  @xcite . a three - flavor framework treatment for atmospheric neutrinos with nsi",
    "is generally regarded to be preferable  @xcite . in the absence of a comprehensive three - flavor framework analysis at this time , we take the view that @xmath36 values exceeding the two - flavor mixing limits , while possibly disfavored , are not as yet ruled out .    as we elaborate in sec .",
    "v , the phenomenology allows structure which only becomes apparent when @xmath2 samples are treated separately from @xmath3 samples  @xcite .",
    "more generally , our study suggests that , in fitting an nsi @xmath6 scenario to data for which no distinction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 on an event - by - event basis is available , there is a risk of `` averaging '' over nsi structure in such way as to reduce to a mimicry of conventional vacuum oscillations .",
    "to obtain accessible expressions of sufficient accuracy , we neglect solar - scale mixing ( @xmath39 ) and subdominant @xmath40 oscillations ( @xmath41 ) , and work in a two - state mixing framework . unless otherwise noted , the normal hierarchy for neutrino mass eigenstates is assumed .",
    "basis states for neutrino flavor ( @xmath42 ) are then @xmath43 and the evolution of states in time ( @xmath44 , so @xmath45 for ultrarelativistic neutrinos ) is governed by the effective wave equation @xmath46    the hamiltonian in flavor basis describing neutrino propagation in vacuum is obtained from the vacuum hamiltonian in mass basis @xmath47 through a rotation via the standard unitary mixing matrix @xmath48 .",
    "we augment the flavor basis vacuum hamiltonian with the nsi potential term @xmath49 @xmath50    the full hamiltonian",
    "is then given by @xmath51    only the real part of @xmath6 distinguishes between @xmath3 and @xmath2 in the derivations to follow .",
    "hereafter we neglect the cp - violating imaginary part of @xmath6 and assume @xmath52 in order to focus on the physics implied by the real part of @xmath6 .",
    "after algebraic manipulation leading to removal of a term proportional to @xmath53 , which merely contributes an overall phase to the oscillation amplitudes , the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the pauli vector , and @xmath56    the corresponding evolution operator @xmath57 is @xmath58    the evolution operator @xmath59 amounts to a rotation of @xmath60 about the direction @xmath61 in the two - flavor spinor space , where @xmath62 is given by @xmath63    in eq .",

    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 , the @xmath68-factor becomes 1 and the survival probabilities simplify to @xmath73    we observe that relative to the standard survival probability , the vacuum oscillation phase is augmented by an additional term which is independent of @xmath74 ; it is a matter effect induced by the flavor - changing nsi .",
    "it is important that the nsi matter effect phase term appears with a different sign in the expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath2 survival probabilities .",
    "our formalism as above is rabi spin oscillations in another guise ; it utilizes nsi phenomenology which is contained implicitly in many published expositions .",

    "<S> neutrinos propagating through matter may participate in forward coherent neutral - current - like scattering arising from non - standard interactions as well as from the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein matter potential @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at fixed long baselines through matter of constant density , the non - standard interaction potential @xmath1 can contribute an additional term to the oscillation phase whose sign differs for @xmath2 versus @xmath3 propagation in matter . </S>",
    "<S> its presence can cause different apparent @xmath4 to be erroneously inferred on the basis of oscillations in vacuum , with values lying above ( for @xmath2 ) or below ( for @xmath3 ) the actual @xmath5 for the case where @xmath6 is predominantly real - valued and of sign opposite to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> an nsi scenario invoking only @xmath8 is shown to be capable of accounting for a disparity recently reported between oscillation survival for @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes measured at @xmath9 by the minos experiment . </S>",
    "<S> implications for mantle traversal by atmospheric neutrinos are examined . the nsi matter potential with non - maximal mixing </S>",
    "<S> could evade conventional atmospheric neutrino analyses which do not distinguish @xmath3 from @xmath2 on an event - by - event basis . </S>"
