    "chemotaxis refers to the migration of bacteria up chemical gradients . for _",
    "escherichia coli _ ,",
    "the basis of chemotaxis is largely understood @xcite : in the absence of a chemical gradient , an _ e. coli _ bacterium performs a random walk@xcite .",
    "when chemical gradients are present , the bacterium s internal biochemical reactions detect the gradients and couple to the bacterial movement system . this sensing biases the random walk , and",
    "the bacterium has a net drift towards a chemical attractant . under special conditions",
    ", the bacteria can excrete the chemoattractant aspartate @xcite by converting carbon and nitrogen sources ( succinate and ammonia , respectively ) in their environment . in these experiments",
    "no _ external _ chemical gradients are present .",
    "instead , each bacterium moves in response to the attractant produced by other bacteria .",
    "thus , the excretion of attractant produces a long - range force between the bacteria , and induces complicated interactions in the colony .    the equations for the collective motion of the bacteria can be derived ( with no free parameters ) from the underlying biochemistry@xcite , allowing quantitative comparisons between theory and experiments .",
    "the basic equations for the bacterial density @xmath0 and the attractant concentration @xmath1 are @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the bacterial diffusion constant , @xmath4 the chemotactic coefficient , @xmath5 the rate of bacterial division , @xmath6 the rate of attractant production , and @xmath7 the chemical diffusion constant .",
    "the terms in equation [ ks1 ] include the diffusion of bacteria , chemotactactic drift and division of bacteria .",
    "equation [ ks2 ] expresses the diffusion and production of attractant .",
    "equations of this type were first used to describe bacteria by keller and segal @xcite , and , with variations , have been the subject of extensive investigations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . for _",
    ", schnitzer _ et .",
    "established the connection @xcite between the time averaged properties of the bacterial response and parameters in equations ( [ ks1 ] , [ ks2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the extensive studies of individual bacteria provide a rigorous justification for the equations , as well as measurements of the coefficients .",
    "there is one complication to this statement that is worthwhile to mention : in 1975 spudich and koshland @xcite showed that _ e. coli _ have `` non - genetic individuality '' , manifest in a distribution of tumble times ( by about a factor of 2 ) between genetically identical bacteria .",
    "the consequence of this is that both time - averaged and ensemble - averaged properties of the bacteria are necessary to predict hydrodynamic coefficients ; in addition , the dynamics must be such that the `` distribution '' of bacteria in the ensemble does not change with time .",
    "it is convenient to nondimensionalize equations ( [ ks1 ] , [ ks2 ] ) by choosing a characteristic density equal to the maximum initial density @xmath8 .",
    "the characteristic scale of attractant is @xmath9 .",
    "the density then determines the length scale and timescale according to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "typical numerical values are @xmath12/sec ; @xmath13/sec ; @xmath14/sec ; and @xmath15/second / bacteria . for an experiment @xcite which has @xmath16",
    ", the length scale is 260 microns and the timescale 100 seconds .",
    "the equations become @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for the experiments shown in figure 1 ,",
    "cells divide much more slowly than the dynamics take place : the timescale for cell division is @xmath20 hours , giving @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we approximate @xmath22 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath23 varies : for experiments in semi - solid agar , the diffusion of bacteria is much slower than attractant diffusion , which motivates the limit @xmath24 @xcite . for experiments on bacteria in a liquid culture , @xmath25 .",
    "we will consider both of these limits in this paper .",
    "the @xmath26 limit is particularly convenient for asymptotic calculations ; we will use @xmath24 when doing analytic calculations .",
    "our numerical simulations give results independent of @xmath27 in the range between 0 and 1 .    for analytic calculations , working with the mass",
    "is particularly convenient , as will become apparent below . for reference",
    ", we show the form of the equations here .",
    "define the mass contained within a radius @xmath28 as @xmath29 this definition ( and the limit @xmath24 ) allows us to eliminate the concentration and write the original equations as @xmath30",
    "in this section we construct the solution for a uniformly collapsing cylinder of bacteria , according to the evolution equations ( 3,4 ) .",
    "although the existence of cylindrical chemotactic collapse is well known @xcite , the asymptotic solution describing the collapse has never been constructed .",
    "herrero and velazquez @xcite understood important features of two - dimensional collapse and attempted to find the solution ; however , their solution is different from what we observe in numerical simulations ( see figure [ length ] ) and is therefore probably unstable .",
    "the usual derivation of a similarity solution derives a set of ordinary differential equations from the scaling laws suggested by dimensional analysis .",
    "as shown below , the major difficulty arises because in the present situation these odes have no solutions consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "this breakdown of `` dimensional '' scaling only occurs in two - dimensional collapse . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the scaling laws suggested by dimensional analysis work fine @xcite .",
    "the overall structure of this problem is similar to critical collapse in the focusing nonlinear schrodinger equation @xcite , where the initial proposal for constructing the asymptotic solution involved rather intricate mathematics ( continuation as a function of spatial dimension ) .",
    "recently , a more physical derivation was put forward @xcite . this work on the nonlinear schrodinger equation inspired our construction of the solution for chemotactic collapse .",
    "our central result is that the density singularity shows corrections to the dimensional scaling laws .",
    "defining @xmath31 the distance to the singular time , the dimensional scaling law is @xmath32 . in the transient regime , we find a slow power law correction to this dimensional scaling law , @xmath33 .",
    "after the transient asymptotic regime , logarithmic corrections are present , of the form @xmath34 although the transient regime is present for 10 decades in the collapse time , we believe that this log log law is the asymptotically correct blow up rate .",
    "a log log correction also appears for 2d critical collapse in the nonlinear schrodinger equation ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the competition between dissipation and collapse leads to a critical dimension . in this problem ,",
    "the critical dimension is 2 , and one dimensional collapse  that is , collapse to a planar structure with infinite density  is forbidden .",
    "we make qualitative arguments to explain the critical dimension by comparing the chemotactic and diffusive fluxes in a contracting structure .",
    "first , no singularities exist for one - dimensional contraction . for a sheet of thickness @xmath35",
    "the diffusive flux is of order ( see equations ( [ ks1 ] , [ ks2 ] ) ) @xmath36 the chemotactic flux follows by integrating @xmath37 and defining @xmath38 as the mass per unit area of the planar region . then the chemotactic flux is @xmath39 if the system collapses onto a plane , the thickness of the sheet @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the diffusive flux blows up while the chemotactic flux is unchanged .",
    "thus a planar region with small thickness is unable to form infinite density , because diffusion eventually stops the collapse .",
    "the situation is different for higher dimensional structures . for symmetric spherical collapse ( three directions contract simultaneously ) ,",
    "the chemotactic flux is singular .",
    "when we balance @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 .",
    "this implies a concentration gradient @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mass contained within a radius @xmath45 .",
    "the net inward flux of bacteria is then @xmath46 as @xmath47 the inward flux ( second term ) dominates and collapse occurs .    in two dimensions we encounter a subtlety .",
    "assuming cylindrical collapse and repeating the dimensional argument , we have @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "( here @xmath50 is the mass per unit length of the cylinder . )",
    "the inward flux is @xmath51 two dimensional collapse is critical : both fluxes have the same scaling with @xmath45 . according to this simplified argument",
    ", there is a net inward flux if @xmath52 , which suggests that a system with mass above this critical value collapses .",
    "we now quantify the preceding dimensional arguments and collect the known solutions to the chemotactic equations .",
    "( as discussed above , the analytic solutions are derived with @xmath26 . ) first , consider one - dimensional collapse . making the substitution@xcite @xmath53 in equations ( [ density ] , [ attract ] ) implies @xmath54 this equation is the burgers equation ; singular solutions to this equation do not exist @xcite .    in @xmath55 and higher",
    ", density singularities can develop . in three dimensions ,",
    "the nature of the blowup is straightforward .",
    "the characteristic length scale ( @xmath56 ) varies in time , and the spatial structure is determined by the changes in @xmath56 .",
    "a singularity corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "we guess the form of the similarity solution by balancing the different terms in equations ( [ density],[attract ] ) .",
    "the diffusive dynamics imply @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the singular time and @xmath60 the distance to the singular time . defining a dimensionless similarity variable @xmath61 ,",
    "we find the scaling form of the density , concentration , and mass : @xmath62 in writing this form of solution , we have assumed radial collapse at the origin ( @xmath63 . for a similarity solution to be valid , it must obey the correct boundary conditions : the density @xmath0 and the attractant concentration @xmath1 must be time - independent far from the singularity , which requires @xmath64 and @xmath65 constant as @xmath66 .",
    "plugging in the scaling form gives an ordinary differential equation in the similarity variable @xmath67 .",
    "( throughout this discussion , @xmath68 refers to the number of simultaneously contracting dimensions . )",

    "the density profiles at different times ( left ) have been collapsed by rescaling the length scale ( right ) .",
    "this figure shows the basic features of the solution : in the `` inner '' region , there is a scaling solution .",
    "this matches onto an `` outer '' region far from the singularity , with a final `` boundary '' region where the boundary conditions must be satisfied .",
    "we illustrate this section with plots from a single numerical simulation . the numerical method is described in appendix b ; its most important feature is the remeshing , which moves mesh points every time the maximum density increases by one percent to better resolve the singularity @xcite .    how do we reconcile the numerical ( and experimental ) observations of two - dimensional collapse with the argument above that no solutions exist ?",
    "we argue here that corrections to the similarity solution arise to solve this problem .",
    "we find in numerical simulations that although the basic self - similar scaling @xmath75 is preserved , the time dependence of @xmath76 is different than the simple dimensional argument suggests .",
    "figure [ length ] shows the scaling of @xmath76 with time : if the dimensional law @xmath77 held , then @xmath78 ( plotted on the right ) would be constant .",
    "our simulations indicate a more complex time dependence than @xmath77 .",
    "we argue that the problem develops two timescales : a fast timescale on which collapse happens , and a slow timescale corresponding to changes in the similarity profile .",
    "working in `` similarity variables '' allows a separation of these two timescales : we eliminate the known , fast time dependence so we can analyze the slow evolution of the system .    as @xmath79",
    ", the inner collapsing region converges to a similarity solution which we call the _ stationary _ solution because it has the same form as the stationary solution to the original equations .",
    "this asymptotic solution has a dimensionless mass of precisely 4 .",
    "thus , the evolution of the similarity solution has a specific physical interpretation . in dimensionless ( similarity ) variables ,",
    "an inner region expels any excess mass to approach @xmath80 .",
    "( figure [ logsketch ] ) . matching between the inner and outer regions determines the dynamics .",
    "= 2.5 in      to find the solution , we use techniques originally applied to a similar problem in the 2d nonlinear schrodinger equation@xcite .",
    "we first define an important quantity : the collapse rate @xmath81 .",
    "( note that the collapse rate of the system is @xmath82 ; we can make a dimensionless collapse rate by multiplying by the timescale @xmath83 .",
    "thus @xmath84 is the collapse rate . ) for `` regular '' collapse , the collapse rate @xmath85 is a constant . in the presence of corrections ,",
    "the collapse rate goes asymptotically to zero .    we rewrite the similarity equation assuming that both quantities @xmath86 and @xmath73 depend on the similarity variable @xmath87 and ( slowly ) on time",
    "the similarity equation is then @xmath88 note that here the time derivative of @xmath89 refers only to",
    "_ explicit _ time dependence of the mass ; the second term in the equation takes into account the time dependence slaved to the varying length scale .",
    "we can solve the similarity equation in the inner region . as the collapse proceeds",
    ", it does indeed slow down .",
    "in fact , a numerical measurement of @xmath84 ( figure [ ldotl ] ) shows that the collapse rate decreases by 3 orders of magnitude during the initial stages of the collapse .",
    "this motivates us to look for a solution with @xmath90 ; that is , a stationary solution ( in similarity variables ) .",
    "this stationary solution solves equations ( [ masseqn],[masseqn2 ] ) when @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the equation for the mass is then @xmath92 exact analytic solutions to this equation are @xmath93    from the formula for @xmath94 , we see an important feature of the stationary solution : the total mass is 4 in dimensionless units .",
    "this reflects a rigorous result@xcite : collapse will occur if and only if the total mass per unit length of the cylinder satisfies @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath96 , no collapse is possible ",
    "the system evolves to constant density . for @xmath97",
    ", collapse occurs ; however , numerical simulations show that the collapse converges toward a solution with a collapsing mass precisely equal to four . in similarity variables , therefore , mass flows _ away _ from the origin .",
    "compare this expression for @xmath98 to the numerical density profiles in figure [ logstat ] .",
    "the shape of the profile is accurately described by the formula for @xmath98 , which confirms that the stationary solution holds in the inner region . at large @xmath99 ,",
    "the stationary solution has @xmath100 , while the boundary conditions require @xmath101 .",
    "this `` inner '' solution to the equations must therefore match onto an `` outer '' solution , as shown in figure [ logstat ] .",
    "how to analyze this matching is the subject of the rest of this section .",
    "where does the crossover between inner and outer region occur ?",
    "we can estimate the location of the crossover by noting that the crossover between inner and outer solutions will happen at some coordinate @xmath102 , when @xmath103 ( see equation ( [ masseqn ] ) ) this gives @xmath104 the proportionality between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is clear in numerics ( figure [ ldotl ] ) .      near the beginning of the collapse ,",
    "the singular ( inner ) part of the solution has formed , but still strongly feels the influence of the boundary . during this initial , transient regime in the dynamics , excess mass is expelled . at the end of the transient regime",
    ", the true asymptotic state is reached .",
    "the transient regime is clear in the simulation shown here ( figures [ length ] , [ ldotl ] , [ rho ] ) , where it persists until @xmath107 . here",
    "we attempt to analyze the transient regime and consider how the system approaches the asymptotic regime .",
    "this analysis is difficult , because the transient dynamics depend on the initial and boundary conditions of the system , and hence is particularly difficult to characterize analytically .",
    "why even bother with the transient behavior ?",
    "because , as we mentioned above , the transient regime persists until @xmath108 .",
    "the density increases by 10 orders of magnitude before the true asymptotic dynamics are reached@xcite .",
    "therefore , all experiments can probe only the transient regime .",
    "furthermore , the detailed dynamics of the transient regime are not highly sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "we did a number of simulations in which the length scale of the initial density distribution was varied ( figure [ initcond ] ) . when the density is initially almost constant , the time at which the singularity is reached , @xmath109 , is large compared to a simulation in which the density is initially peaked .",
    "however , the transient dynamics are almost identical , regardless of whether the density is initially constant , or highly peaked @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the transient regime that follows is incomplete and _ ad hoc_. it is , however , the only self consistent explanation of numerical results we were able to find .",
    "we welcome additional , more conclusive work on this question .",
    "we argue that the corrections to the length scale in the transient regime are faster than logarithmic .",
    "although theoretically we can not rule out logarithms , we were not able to find an asymptotic solution for a correction which depended purely logaritmically in time that explained all features of the numerical simulations .",
    "for this reason we believe that the most consistent interpretation of the transient regime is that it actually breaks the scaling laws predicted by dimensional analysis and introduces different exponents .    here",
    "we use features of the numerical solution to guide our construction of the transient correction ; this argument , while not entirely satisfactory , is at least consistent with all the simulations .",
    "we seek corrections to dimensional scaling of power law form : that is , @xmath110 and we are determining @xmath111 . as long as @xmath112 , we still have asymptotic validity of the analysis , because @xmath105 goes to 0 .",
    "( note that @xmath113 depends on the initial and boundary conditions , and is not universal . )",
    "we can distinguish between the transient and asymptotic regimes by looking at figure [ cmeas ] .",
    "this plot shows profiles of the normalized density ( @xmath114 ) times @xmath115 . at later times",
    ", the curve shows a flat region , demonstrating that @xmath116 over a large region .",
    "this is the hallmark of the true asymptotic regime : the stationary solution is valid in the collapsing region , then @xmath117 outer region exists far from the singularity , which in turn connects to the boundary . for earlier times",
    ", however , the flattened region is not present : instead the forming singularity connects directly to the outer `` bump '' where the excess mass has been pushed .",
    "@xcite    the inner solution must match on to the `` bump '' that makes up the outer region @xcite .",
    "the bump corresponds to the excess mass in the system , which is stationary in real coordinates .",
    "thus the position of the bump in similarity variables is @xmath118 , where we have assumed power law corrections to the length scale . by reading off the plot ( figure [ cmeas ] ) we can see two important features of the outer region : first , the value of @xmath119 is constant at the position of the bump : @xmath120 .",
    "next , the form of the solution from the crossover point to the bump ( @xmath121 ) is approximately a power law , which we write @xmath122 the exponent @xmath123 is a free parameter that we find from the simulations .",
    "taking @xmath6 from the numerics ( reading off figure [ cmeas ] ) uniquely determines all other scaling exponents and hence gives a consistency check . to determine @xmath111 ,",
    "combining the relations above lets us determine the time dependence @xmath124 .",
    "this means that in the intermediate regime @xmath121 the solution obeys @xmath125 finally , we match the two solutions at the crossover @xmath126 , leading to the result @xmath127 .",
    "demanding consistency in time scaling we must have @xmath128 .",
    "this determines @xmath129 : @xmath130 for the simulations shown , @xmath131 .",
    "we have examined @xmath6 for a variety of initial conditions and find it always to be close to this value .",
    "this one assumption for @xmath6 leads to predictions for other measureable exponents , all of which are in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "thus in the transient regime we have @xmath132 these scalings compare well with numerics , shown in figures [ length],[ldotl ] , and [ rho ] .",
    "once a true scale separation exists between the inner ( collapsing ) region and the boundary , the matching is different .",
    "here we see slow ( logarithmic ) corrections in numerics , motivating us to seek a logarithmic correction to the length scale .",

    "extensive simulations have found two types of density singularities caused by modulations to the cylinder .      _ travelling singularities _ occur when a step - like perturbation is placed on the cylinder , increasing the density for @xmath195 and decreasing the density for @xmath196 .",
    "the subsequent evolution occurs at the boundary between these two regions . a simulation of this process is shown in figure [ prop1 ] .",
    "the higher density region propagates to the left .",
    "heuristically , the higher density region is beginning to contract as a sphere , so its decrease in size is consistent with the beginnings of spherical collapse .",
    "this propagating singularity can be described as a solution to the phase equation of the form @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the basic phase expected from collapse .",
    "all the nontrivial space and time dependence is absorbed in @xmath199 and @xmath200 . inserting into the phase equation ( [ phaselog ] ) , we have @xmath201 the right hand side of this equation is @xmath202 , which becomes arbitrarily small as the singularity is approached .",
    "therefore , the left hand side must be equal to zero , which gives @xmath203 if we demand the balance @xmath204 , then @xmath205 the solution for @xmath199 is then @xmath206    figure [ prop1 ] shows the density along the centerline of the cylinder .",
    "the decay of the highest density is exponential , as predicted by the phase - equation solution constructed above .",
    "a fit to the numerical data shows that @xmath207    figure [ xmax ] shows the location of the edge of the maximum density region @xmath208 as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "as predicted by the phase equation analysis , the figure shows that @xmath209 .",
    "a least squares regression gives the prefactor @xmath210 .",
    "the qualitative features of the numerical simulations are thus in good agreement with the theory .",
    "quantitatively , however there is a discrepency : the theory predicts that we should have @xmath211 , while our numerical simulation gives @xmath212 .",
    "we believe that the discrepancy arises because the convergence of our numerical scheme requires we keep a small @xmath213 , while the analysis in the previous subsection assumes @xmath24 .",
    "stationary singularities  in which the blow - up happens at a spatial point  occur in the numerics for a wide variety of initial conditions .",
    "we believe that this represents the generic evolution of a modulated cylinder .",
    "indeed , it is the end state of the travelling solution just discussed , when the propagating wave runs into the reflection  symmetric boundary condition .",
    "an instance of this solution is depicted in figure [ prop2 ] .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , the corrections to dimensional scaling are important in this solution . for our analysis , we take the point of blow - up to be at @xmath214 . satisfying the equation",
    "requires that the @xmath191 length scale incorporate corrections to the scaling : @xmath215 using @xmath216 the phase equation becomes @xmath217 demanding that the two sides scale the same way in time ( and assuming @xmath218 has a power law form , so that @xmath219constant ) , we have @xmath220 which gives @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "thus @xmath223 , which differs from the radial length scale @xmath224 .",
    "the result is @xmath225 this shows that the generic density singularity that forms during the breakdown of cylindrical collapse , is _ not _ spherical collapse , but something milder .",
    "locally , since the axial scale @xmath169 is much larger than the radial scale @xmath193 the structure still looks like a cylinder .",
    "numerical evidence for this conclusion is evident in fig 13 , which shows that the singularity develops a length scale in the axial direction which is much larger than the radial scale @xmath226 .",
    "for example , in fig 13 when @xmath227 ( so @xmath228 ) then @xmath229 .",
    "our numerical algorithms have unfortunately not allowed us to find the asymptotic @xmath230 numerically ; the problem is that the separation of scales is so great between the radial and axial scales that one needs many more mesh points than we can afford to resolve the asymptotic regime .",
    "the question of relevance to the experiments is what happens next : once blowup occurs at a spatial point the cylinder has a `` free end '' , which changes the nature of the collapse .",
    "we can no longer use the strategy of the previous section  perturbation about a collapsing cylinder ",
    "because the radial structure is no longer closely approximated by the cylindrical solution .",
    "the pinch - off drives the dynamics ; specifically , the sharp end of the cylinder forms a travelling wave .",
    "heuristically , note that an edge of bacteria produces a higher concentration of attractant where the density is higher .",
    "thus the `` tail '' of bacteria moves toward higher attractant density , and a travelling wave can form .",
    "quantitatively , recall that for variation in one spatial dimension the equations reduce to the burgers equation , which has travelling wave solutions@xcite .",
    "the contraction of a cylinder end has been observed for the bacteria @xcite , and the travelling waves have been discussed in other contexts@xcite . here",
    "we discuss the instability of the recoiling end and the final spacing of the spheres .",
    "= 1.2 in    = 1.2 in    = 1.2 in    = 1.2 in    figure [ cylend ] shows a set of numerical simulations of a retracting cylinder .",
    "the simulation shows that the `` end '' of the cylinder collapses into a spherical aggregate , and simultaneously , in front of the aggregate `` waves '' travel into the bulk of the cylinder . in the simulations ,",
    "the ends of the cylinder actually try to collapse to an aggregate of infinite density . in order to continue beyond this singularity and simulate the formation of an array of aggregates we introduced a cutoff which emulates the biochemistry in the actual experiment : when the bacterial density becomes too high , the bacteria consume all the food sources ( succinate and oxygen ) in their local environment and cease producing the attractant aspartate .",
    "we modelled this by changing the equation for @xmath1 to @xmath231 here we have introduced @xmath232 , the cutoff bacterial density . in @xcite",
    "this cutoff density was estimated ( assuming the cutoff was caused by oxygen depletion ) and shown to vary exponentially with the overhead oxygen concentration in the cell : @xmath233 for the simulation shown in figure [ cylend ] this cutoff is @xmath234 .",
    "note that the density of the ( undisturbed ) cylinder in front of the retracting rim slowly approaches the cutoff density @xmath232 ; we have found in simulations that the undisturbed cylinder always collapses to a density close to the cutoff value .",
    "the formation of the density wave occurs because the retracting end perturbs the cylinder in front of it .",
    "we can find the time - evolution of perturbations to the cylinder , requiring that they decay away from the free end .",
    "the most unstable mode can be found using methods of stationary phase(cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the linear growth rate is @xmath235 the point of stationary phase @xmath236 satisfies @xcite @xmath237    for the discussion here , we perform the calculation using the free space dispersion relation . a perturbation to constant density has the form @xmath238 where we have taken @xmath239 for simplicity in this calculation .",
    "plugging into the equations and linearizing gives the dispersion relation : @xmath240 the most unstable mode is , in dimensionless units , @xmath241 these formulae demonstrate that the wavelength of the modulations are governed by the undisturbed density in front of the rim . since this density is asymptotically determined by the _ cutoff _ @xmath242",
    ", it follows that the wavelength of the ripples is determined by the cutoff .",
    "the characteristic distance between the aggregates is , therefore , determined by the cutoff .",
    "this conclusion can be experimentally tested .",
    "the predictions for the wavelength and velocity of the front compare well with numerical simulations . on decreasing @xmath242 from @xmath243 to @xmath244 the wavelength of the ripples increases from @xmath245 to @xmath246 , in qualitative agreement with the formulas .",
    "we remark that the basic scenario outlined in this section was discovered by elena budrene , in unpublished experiments : after observing the travelling band to collapse as a cylinder ( fig",
    ". 1 ) budrene observes fast `` waves '' propagating around the cylinder .",
    "then , a fragmentation front moves across the collapsing cylinder , leaving spherical aggregates behind .",
    "the present theory predicts a scenario that is at least qualitatively very similar : the fast `` waves '' correspond to the excitations of the cylinder from the phase equation ( i.e. the travelling steps , described in section 3 ) .",
    "the fragmentation front occurs due to the mechanism outlined in this section .",
    "unfortunately , it is not currently possible to make a quantitative comparison of the experiments to the present theory , though such a comparison would prove most interesting .",
    "this paper has shown how the patterns formed by _ e. coli _ are connected to the geometry of singularity formation in the hydrodynamic description of the bacteria .",
    "we have constructed the solution for critical ( two - dimensional ) collapse , and developed a theory for modulations to the cylinder .",
    "the phase equation provides a useful simplified description of a perturbed cylinder .",
    "ultimately , the spacing of spherical aggregates is determined by the instability of a pinched cylinder of bacteria .",
    "here we compare our work to published experiments and suggest tests of the theory .",
    "not all the coefficients in the original equations have been precisely measured @xcite for the experimental regime of interest .",
    "in particular , neither the attractant production rate @xmath123 nor the chemotactic coefficient @xmath247 have been measured for bacteria in the same chemical environment as that of the collapse experiments .",
    "thus , at this stage we can make only order of magnitude numerical comparison with experiments .",
    "here we use the values of the coefficients for bacteria in a liquid medium @xcite : bacterial diffusion coefficient @xmath248/sec ; attractant diffusion coefficient @xmath249/sec@xcite ; chemotactic coefficient @xmath14/sec ; and attractant production rate @xmath15/second / bacteria    an important prediction of this theory is the critical mass of bacteria for cylindrical collapse : assuming the above parameters , the formation of a collapsing cylinder requires a minimum number of bacteria per unit length @xmath250/cm .",
    "the existence of a critical number of bacteria for cylindrical collapse has been inferred from experiments@xcite , but this number has never been directly measured .",
    "we emphasize that ( with precise experimental measurements for the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) the theory rigorously and precisely predicts this critical mass , allowing a direct test of the theory .    in this paper",
    "we have extensively discussed how to construct the correct description of two dimensional collapse . in the experiments , the subtle corrections to the dimensional",
    "scaling are probably not directly observable .",
    "however , the basic scaling relations expected from the similarity solution  for example , that the maximum density is related to the length scale of density variations by @xmath251 could be measured in experiments , both for cylindrical and spherical collapse .",
    "so far , no quantitative and controlled measurements of the bacterial density have been performed .    in the section on cylindrical collapse , we discussed both the `` transient '' initial regime , and the final asymptotic regime which appears after true scale separation between the inner and outer solution is achieved . in practice , we expect that the experiments probe only the transient regime",
    ". the hard upper limit on bacterial density is when the bacteria are closely packed ; this corresponds to a density of @xmath252 .",
    "a typical initial density of bacteria in the liquid experiments@xcite is @xmath253 .",
    "the density increases by at most three orders of magnitude during the collapse , in contrast with the ten orders of magnitude it takes to reach the asymptotic regime in our simulations .    to our knowledge , modulations to a collapsing cylinder have never been quantitatively measured in experiments ( although as mentioned above , budrene has made qualitative observations of this effect ) .",
    "the travelling and point singularities that we predict for a modulated cylinder may be observable . in particular , we predict that the radial and axial length scales should be different for the point singularity .",
    "because the difference in these length scales arises directly from the corrections in two - dimensional collapse , a measurement of these length scales would test the validity of our derivation of the two - dimensional solution .",
    "the modulated cylinder ultimately pinches off a point .",
    "we have argued that the spacing of spherical aggregates is determined by the instability of a cylinder with an end . in practice , when does the modulated cylinder pinch off ( forming an end ) ? to answer this question , we must know when our theory breaks down .",
    "collapse to infinite density can not happen for bacteria , because they have finite size .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that even before the hard packing density of bacteria is reached , oxygen depletion will stop bacterial collapse .",
    "regardless of the specific mechanism for stopping the collapse , at some time the highest density part of the cylinder ",
    "the point singularity  will stop collapsing .",
    "this is the time of pinch off : the point singularity evolves much more slowly than the neighboring , less dense regions of the cylinder .",
    "this argument about the point of pinch off gives a testable prediction of our model , because the spacing of aggregates depends on the maximum density of the cylinder .",
    "in dimensional units , the most unstable wavelength ( and aggregate spacing ) is @xmath254 where we have used values of the coefficients from above .",
    "thus , varying the maximum attainable density of the bacteria should cause the aggregate spacing to change according to this scaling law . in @xcite a formula for how the maximum density in a collapsed aggregate depends on the oxygen concentration @xmath255 was derived , and shown to be @xmath256 .",
    "this implies that the wavelength of the pattern should decrease exponentially with the oxygen concentration ; systematic experiments could test this prediction .",
    "the one solid prediction that can be compared with present experiments is that there is a _ lower bound _ on the aggregate spacing , that follows from the hard - packing density of bacteria . using the characteristic size @xmath257 m of _ e. coli",
    "_ this is approximately @xmath258 .",
    "thus the measured aggregate spacing should always be above the lower bound @xmath259 where in this estimate we used the assumed values for the constants @xmath260 and @xmath6 .",
    "this lower bound agrees with experiments , in that the spacings are typically measured in millimeters .",

    "for the simulations in two spatial dimensions , we used an adi operator splitting method , which requires using @xmath266 . because these methods are implicit , at each timestep a matrix inversion was necessary .",
    "this is the most expensive part of the numerical method .",
    "the most subtle aspect of the numerical simulations reported in this paper is the mesh refinement . without good mesh refinement",
    "it is impossible to get close enough to the singularity to resolve the ( logarithmic ) corrects uncovered for the cylindrical collapse ; without good mesh refinement in the two - dimensional simulations it would be impossible to acquire enough decades of data to test the phase equation - theory presented in section 4 .",
    "the mesh refinement was performed as follows :    _ one spatial dimension : _ the philosophy of mesh refinement employed in this paper ( first explained to us by jens eggers ) is to frequently implement gradual changes in the mesh , as opposed to infrequently implementing large changes .",
    "mesh refinement is implemented every time the maximum density increases by one percent . during the refinement ,",
    "the characteristic scale over which the solution varies is determined , and a mesh is constructed to well refine this scale ; typically , this involves making sure there are about one hundred mesh points across the region that the solution varies significantly .",
    "the solution at the new mesh is constructed by cubic spline interpolation of the old mesh . because the mesh is refined frequently , the changes to the solution occurring during refinement are small , and there are no convergence difficulties after refinement .",
    "the algorithm allows finding solutions over essentially arbitrary changes in the bacterial density with as little as few hundred mesh points .",
    "the simulations reported in the paper typically use a few thousand mesh points , in order to accurately compute the slow approach to the log log scaling regime .    _ two spatial dimensions : _ in two dimensions , the equations are solved using standard operator splitting techniques .",
    "the mesh is rectangular , described by two functions , the @xmath267 coordinate @xmath268 and the @xmath269 coordinate @xmath270 . because the one dimensional algorithm described above can achieve arbitrary resolution with a few hundred mesh points ,",
    "it is possible to well resolve density changes in both spatial directions using of order @xmath192 mesh points .",
    "the algorithm for these simulations works analogously to that for the one spatial dimension case described above : every fifty time steps , the @xmath267 grid ( or @xmath269 grid ) is remeshed , in accordance with the criterea outlined above . typically we stagger the remeshing between the two directions by twenty five timesteps .    both the one and two dimensional codes were tested extensively by checking the solutions against known analytical results .",
    "all of the results that are presented in this paper follow the philosophy that numerical results are only believable if they can be replicated by asymptotic solutions of the equations ; in turn , asymptotic results are only useful if they show up in numerics .",
    "for the two - dimensional code , one might worry that the operator splitting coupled with the remeshing induces artifical biases in the numerics ; besides checking our numerical solutions against solutions to the phase equation , we have also tested the two dimensional code by checking that it can reproduce the scalings and the similarity solution for spherically symmetric collapse , where the solution is known very well .",
    "in this section we fill in the details of the calculation of the phase equation . evaluating the coefficients in equation ( [ phaseco ] )",
    "we find@xcite @xmath271    to evaluate the solvability condition , we need to find the zero mode of the adjoint to the linearized operator . in this case , the linear operator is the matrix @xmath272 all of the terms in @xmath172 are self - adjoint except those of the form @xmath273 . under the definition ( for a cylinder of bacteria ) of the inner product @xmath274 we can determine the adjoint @xmath275^{\\dagger } = - \\partial_{r } c_o \\partial_{r}\\ ] ] which gives the adjoint linear operator @xmath276 this linear operator possesses a simple zero mode : @xmath277 .",
    "the coefficients of phase equation thus become @xmath278    a subtlety comes when we evaluate the inner products : we must integrate ( in similarity variables ) to the upper limit of validity of the similarity solution . for a cylinder ,",
