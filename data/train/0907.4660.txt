    "<S> we employ the linear @xmath0 model to study the chiral dynamics of two flavors of quarks at finite temperature and density . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations include thermal fluctuations of both the bosonic and fermionic fields . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we determine the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and baryon chemical potential as a function of the pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting phase structure occurs that results in zero , one , or two critical points depending on the value of the vacuum pion mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical pion mass is small but not zero . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the conventional wisdom is that there is no true thermodynamic chiral phase transition at finite temperature @xmath1 and zero baryon chemical potential @xmath2 . instead </S>",
    "<S> , there is expected to be a curve of first - order phase transition in the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane that terminates in a second - order phase transition at some critical point @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the critical point obviously depends on the physical ( vacuum ) pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> this topic has been under intense theoretical study using various effective field theory models , such as the namu jona - lasinio model @xcite , a composite operator model @xcite , a random matrix model @xcite , a linear @xmath0 model @xcite , an effective potential model @xcite , and a hadronic bootstrap model @xcite , as well as various implementations of lattice qcd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also of great interest because collisions between heavy nuclei at medium to high energy , such as at the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , or possible low energy runs at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , may provide experimental information on the phase diagram in the vicinity of a critical point . in this work we study the phase diagram of the linear @xmath0 model coupled to two flavors of identical mass quarks . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the @xmath0 model is an oft - used effective model that represents some of the essential features of the chiral dynamics of qcd , the reason to couple the fields to quarks is less obvious . </S>",
    "<S> one argument is based on the existence of the critical point itself . </S>",
    "<S> if a critical point exists , then one can go around it without crossing the curve of the first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the effective degrees of freedom should not change too much in following such a path . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , if quarks are considered to be reasonably useful degrees of freedom on the higher temperature side then they should be useful on the lower temperature side too . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we use quarks to carry the baryon number but acknowledge the resulting uncertainty in the results . </S>",
    "<S> the present work extends that of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> we include thermal fluctuations of the meson and fermion fields , which can be important at finite temperature when the magnitude of the fluctuations becomes comparable to or greater than the mean values . </S>",
    "<S> we scan vacuum pion masses from zero to over 300 mev , which may be particularly useful for comparison with lattice gauge theory with different quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> even when all other parameters of the model are fixed , we find an interesting phase diagram that may have zero , one or two critical points depending on the value of the vacuum pion mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian is @xmath4 \\psi \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 in an obvious notation . </S>",
    "<S> the su@xmath6su@xmath7 chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the term @xmath8 , which gives the pion a mass . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters in the lagrangian are constrained by fixing the pion decay constant @xmath9 mev , the @xmath0 mass @xmath10 mev , and the quark mass is set to one - third of the nucleon mass @xmath11 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum pion mass @xmath12 is varied from 0 to @xmath13 mev . to create an effective mesonic model , we integrate out the quark degrees of freedom in the usual way @xcite , such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inverse quark propagator . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an effective lagrangian @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> we decompose the scalar field into a condensate @xmath18 plus a fluctuation @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic potential is computed from @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the independent particle contributions from the @xmath0 and pion quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> angular brackets refer to thermal averaging . </S>",
    "<S> the condensate and quasiparticle masses are determined self - consistently from @xmath23 the resulting equations must be solved ( very accurately ) using numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> all thermodynamic identities were verified both analytically and numerically .    </S>",

    "<S> there is only one self - consistent solution . </S>",
    "<S> for the lower temperature of 50 mev , there is a unique solution at large @xmath2 and another unique solution at small @xmath2 . for a range of @xmath2 centered about 900 mev </S>",
    "<S> there are three solutions : one is associated with a continuation of the low - density phase , one is associated with a continuation with the high - density phase , and the third solution ( not shown in the figure ) is an unstable phase . </S>",
    "<S> the point where the two curves cross is the location of the phase transition . in this example </S>",
    "<S> it is first - order since there is a discontinuity in the slope @xmath24 . where each curve terminates is the limit of metastability for that phase . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamically favored phase is the one with the largest pressure . at some temperature between 50 and 80 mev </S>",
    "<S> the slopes are equal at the crossing point , there are no metastable phases , and the second derivative is discontinuous . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of a second - order phase transition . </S>",
