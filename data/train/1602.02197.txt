    "understanding the vacuum structure of qcd is one of the most interesting and intriguing field of research for about thirty years now .",
    "new signals of non - trivial topological fluctuations in qcd have been proposed in recent times , like chiral magnetic effect  @xcite and anomaly induced transport  @xcite .",
    "it is an ongoing topic of research in trying to understand appropriate experimental signatures of chiral magnetic effect in heavy ion collision experiments at rhic at bnl and at cern .",
    "recent studies of hydrodynamic evolution in presence of chiral anomaly has also provided hints towards charge separation of different pion species  @xcite .",
    "however this is not a unique signature of non - trivial topological fluctuations in qcd .",
    "effects of topological fluctuations would also show up in ratios of thermodynamic observables near the chiral phase transition at vanishingly small baryon densities if indeed the strongly interacting matter created in heavy - ion collision thermalizes . as known from the pioneering paper  @xcite",
    "that @xmath0 though an anomalous symmetry in qcd , may affect the nature of phase transition in qcd with two light quark flavors .",
    "if the @xmath0 anomaly is not effectively restored at the chiral crossover transition then in the limit of vanishingly small light quark mass , the phase transition is second order with @xmath1 critical exponents , otherwise it could be either first order or second order with @xmath2 universality class  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is known from model quantum field theories in the @xmath1 universality class that the ratio of higher order baryon fluctuations like @xmath3 should have a very characteristic behavior at the chiral crossover transition  @xcite .",
    "measuring such observables in experiments would allow us to understand whether @xmath0 is still effectively broken and thus indirectly find out the topological fluctuations responsible for it . our earlier work  @xcite has lead to the hints that @xmath0 may not be effectively restored at @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the chiral crossover transition temperature and weakly interacting instantons may be responsible for its breaking at such temperatures . in this talk ,",
    "i present our latest results on our ongoing studies about understanding the mechanism for the @xmath0 breaking at temperatures between @xmath6-@xmath7 .",
    "we investigate the nature of the topological structures that cause @xmath0 breaking at these temperatures from the eigenvalue spectrum of the qcd dirac operator and from the topological susceptibility using lattice techniques .",
    "i conclude the discussion with the possible consequences of presence of such non - trivial topological structures at these temperatures for the experiments .",
    "effects of anomalous @xmath0 symmetry on qcd phase transition with two light quark flavors is known from model quantum field theories with same symmetries as qcd .",
    "however the @xmath0 breaking is implemented through an effective term in the lagrangian whose strength can only be determined from first principles lattice qcd studies .",
    "however lattice studies have their own share of systematic uncertainties .",
    "one needs to choose a sufficiently large lattice volume to contain enough of these topological structures .",
    "second and the most crucial aspect is to control the lattice cut - off effects .",
    "most lattice fermion discretizations break the continuum chiral symmetry and the flavor singlet @xmath0 explicitly .",
    "only two known lattice fermion discretizations , the overlap and the domain wall fermions in the limit of infinite large fifth dimensional extent on which it is defined , are known to realize chiral symmetry explicitly on the lattice .",
    "these operators also satisfy an exact index theorem , thus the @xmath0 breaking can be related to the non - trivial gauge field topology .",
    "we use the gauge configurations generated with mbius domain wall fermion discretization and iwasaki gauge action with dislocation suppressing determinant .",
    "the details of the gauge configurations are in  @xcite .",
    "the light and the strange quark masses are physical such that @xmath8 .",
    "the small residual chiral symmetry breaking for these domain wall fermion configurations is @xmath9 and the index is not exactly realized .",
    "hence we use overlap fermions as valence quarks to count the zero modes of the gauge configurations and measure the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the overlap operator @xmath10 $ ] , consists of a sign function of wilson dirac operator @xmath11 , which is the lattice discretization of the continuum dirac operator with an irrelevant term and a domain wall height parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the sign function was measured to a precision of about @xmath13 and the violation of the exact chiral symmetry given by the ginsparg - wilson relation was of the same order of magnitude for each gauge configuration . on each configuration",
    ", @xmath14 eigenvalues of @xmath15 were measured using the kalkreuter - simma ritz algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed about @xmath16 configurations at each temperature .",
    "our lattice volumes are sufficiently large enough , @xmath17 essential for such a study . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dweig ] we show our results for the eigenvalue density of the qcd dirac operator as a function of temperature .",
    "as the temperature increases one observes a gradual appearance of a small near - zero mode peak separating from the bulk eigenvalues whose contribution diminishes at @xmath7 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dweig ] .",
    "one needs a careful study of the near - zero modes since its origin may be due to residual chiral symmetry breaking effects of the domain wall fermions  @xcite .",
    "one of the measures of @xmath0 breaking is the non - vanishing value of the difference between integrated pion and delta meson correlation functions , @xmath18 .",
    "from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chipd ] it is evident that this quantity is non - zero at even @xmath7 and a large contribution comes from the first @xmath14 eigenvalues .",
    "it is also known that if the analytic(bulk ) part of the eigenvalue spectrum goes as @xmath19 , then @xmath0 breaking effects are invisible in upto 6-point correlation functions in the scalar and pseudo - scalar sectors  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the analytic part of the renormalized eigenvalue spectrum has a behavior quite different from @xmath20 at @xmath7 irrespective of the lattice discretization ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chipd ] ) , by comparing our eigenspectrum with those previously measured by us using improved staggered ( hisq ) fermions  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 is not effectively restored at @xmath7 and the contribution of the analytic part of the eigenspectrum to its breaking is quite robust unaffected by lattice cut - off effects . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "breaking in the scalar - pseudoscalar sector measured through the observable @xmath18 ( left panel ) shows that @xmath0 is not effectively restored at @xmath7 .",

    "the @xmath0 breaking at @xmath21 leads to a finite @xmath22 mass and is related to the physics of instantons  @xcite .",
    "near the chiral crossover , the qcd vacuum properties are not yet well understood .",
    "instanton liquid model  @xcite provides explanation for chiral symmetry breaking and properties of hadronic correlations  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that qcd instantons at finite temperature with non - trivial holonomy has substructures called dyons  @xcite which carry both electric and magnetic charges . in order to understand the existence and interactions between these different topological structures , we measure the topological susceptibility in qcd , defined as @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "it measures the local fluctuations of the topological charge @xmath24 though @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since we use overlap fermions with an exact index theorem , we for the first time , report the results for @xmath26 in lattice qcd with exact chiral symmetry at high temperatures .",
    "the @xmath26 shows sensitivity to the quark mass as seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : topsusc ] . for light quark masses about twice the physical values ,",
    "@xmath26 is enhanced by factor two near @xmath5 .",
    "fitting @xmath27 to a function @xmath28 , we get an exponent @xmath29 for physical quark masses and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . for a dilute gas of instantons , including first order quantum fluctuations over the classical gauge configurations",
    "gives temperature dependence of @xmath32 .",
    "from the temperature dependence of our data for @xmath26 , it is evident that dilute gas picture has not yet set in at @xmath7",
    ". it also gives a hints about possible existence of dyons in the qcd medium just above @xmath5 , though the trend could be also consistent with the instanton liquid model .",
    "a still better probe is to look into the higher moments of topological charge fluctuations . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : topsusc ] , we show our results for @xmath33 . while near @xmath5 , the data is consistent with an interacting instanton ensemble that scales as @xmath34 , the dilute instanton gas limit do not set in even at @xmath7",
    ". there are strong residual interactions between the finite temperature instantons or they dissociate into dyonic components .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier observation that dilute gas limit may set in only around @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "our study has comprehensively shown that @xmath0 for qcd with two light quark flavors is explicitly broken at @xmath7 . though the near - zero part of the qcd dirac eigenspectrum still needs to be studied in detail , the contribution of the analytic ( bulk ) part of the spectrum to @xmath0 breaking is quite robust insensitive to lattice cut - off effects .",
    "we also looked into the topological constituents that contribute dominantly to @xmath26 just above @xmath5 .",
    "we speculate about the presence of dyons from our data .",
    "it has been recently reported that magnetic monopoles may explain the jet - quenching phenomena in the low @xmath36 region in the range @xmath37gev@xmath38 gev  @xcite .",
    "dyons with non - zero magnetic charges could also possibly contribute to the jet quenching phenomenology in the strongly coupled qgp .",
    "our first results for @xmath26 in the region near @xmath5 , also opens up the possibility of accounting for the chiral imbalance in anomalous hydrodynamics through @xmath26 as an input instead of a non - zero axial chemical potential .",
