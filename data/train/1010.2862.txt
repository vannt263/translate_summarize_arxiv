    "at the powered electrode of an asymmetric rf - discharge , self biasing gives rise to a large potential drop , wide plasma sheath and strong electric fields .",
    "in contrast , the plasma sheath in front of grounded or additionally biased electrodes is less pronounced and thinner .",
    "the properties of such sheaths are , nevertheless , of fundamental interest in view of plasma processing of surfaces  @xcite and plasma chemistry .",
    "@xcite selective biasing of the substrate can be used to optimize the electron and ion impact energies and directions .",
    "@xcite    monitoring plasma characteristics in the sheaths is challenging , since common diagnostics , such as langmuir - probes usually fail .",
    "this is because the macroscopic tip of a langmuir - probe significantly alters the local plasma characteristics and can not resolve density and potential gradients in the narrow sheath with adequate precision . in order to overcome these limitations , alternative diagnostics like optical spectroscopy  @xcite or microparticles as probes  @xcite",
    "those provide an efficient , nearly non - invasive tool for the local diagnostic of the plasma parameters . in view of their practical use ,",
    "a calibration is necessary to discern their own charge dynamics from their capability to reflect the properties of the surrounding plasma .    upon immersion in a plasma ,",
    "microparticles get charged by electrons and ions that accumulate on their surface .",
    "since the electron mobility exceeds those of the ions , the particle charge is in general negative , depending on the local conditions of the surrounding plasma .",
    "albeit , it has been stressed that under certain conditions , such as in a discharge afterglow , microparticles in the bulk plasma can even acquire positive charges .",
    "@xcite while the plasma is operational , particle recharging takes place on longer time scale than the almost instantaneous reaction of the plasma to slightly modified external conditions .",
    "then , the particle charge constantly remains in equilibrium with the surrounding electrons and ions .",
    "drastic changes in the operating conditions , however , may perturb the time scale ordering and hinder an equilibration of the particle charge .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate microparticles which are captured in the plasma sheath and their reaction to changes in the operating conditions of the plasma .",
    "thereby , we focus on switching off the plasma while the lower discharge electrode is grounded or additionally biased as well as changing the bias voltage during operation of the plasma .",

    "the selective application of bias voltages to some pixels allows for studying spatial and temporal changes of the plasma sheath.@xcite the small extension of the pixels as compared to the remaining grounded electrode guarantees that the applied bias only locally influences the plasma sheath but leaves the overall discharge conditions unaltered .",

    "radially , the simulation domain is such large that the boundaries do not affect the results near the center of the discharge . at @xmath49",
    "we used vanishing radial field boundary conditions . due to rotational symmetry",
    ", the biasing of outer lying pixels influences the electrostatic potential above the center pixel to the point of generating a region with negative potential at finite @xmath50 ( left panel of fig .",

    "the sign change of the electric field at @xmath51 implies that a negatively charged particle may only remain hovering for @xmath52 since there gravity and electrostatic force are antiparallel ( right panel of fig .

    "[ fig : vertical_component ] ) .",
    "therefore , keeping up the force equilibrium requires an increasing of the particle charge . whether the particle remains hovering or drops down onto the ae depends on its ability to acquire enough negative charges on a sufficiently short time scale . for systems with markedly higher operating pressures the relevant stages of a plasma decay have been identified by coudel et al .",

    "after the switching off the periodic flooding of the sheath with electrons during each rf - period ceases , but electrons and ions continuously diffuse from the bulk into the sheath . here , the flow of both species is controlled by the applied local bias voltages .",
    "the charge equilibrium in the sheath will vary only slightly as long as enough electrons and ions from the bulk enter the sheath to compensate losses at the wall .",
    "a particle adapts its charge to the altered electron- and ion density in surrounding on time scales of some @xmath53.@xcite since this time scale is faster than the changes of the plasma sheath in the discharge afterglow , the particle charge constantly remains in equilibrium with the charge densities in its surrounding . in order to explain the accelerated fall for @xmath47=(-80,-100,-100)$ ] consider that due to the strong negative bias no electrons at all will be able to penetrate into the sheath above the center pixel anymore .",
    "therefore , the exclusive presence of ions in the surroundings of the particle will drastically reduce its negative charge .",
    "one might even have to consider a positive recharging since gravity and ion drag force  @xcite are too weak to account for the observed behavior alone .",

    "is given . ]    while switching off the plasma certainly alters the equilibrium conditions for the particle drastically , the changes in densities and fields occur on a moderate time scale .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation where the ae - pixel biasing is switched during operation of the plasma . here",
    ", the local plasma sheath adapts within @xmath55 rf - cycles to the new biasing configuration and thus has an instantaneous impact on the charge and force equilibrium of the particle . in principle",

    "this holds for either positive or negative voltages .",

    "details on the simulation can be found in appendix  [ app_pic ] .    the initial ae - configuration in fig .",

    "its primary purpose is to keep the particle in the camera focus . as can be seen from the simulation results in fig .",

    "while the two - dimensional color plots in fig .  [ fig : diagnostic_regions ] provide a general overview of the sheath structure above the ae - pixels , fig .",
    "[ fig : change_sheath ] allows for a quantitative analysis on the symmetry axis .",
    "the time - averaged electron density is markedly reduced as compared to the ion density .",
    "electrons may overcome the potential barrier of the plasma potential and enter the sheath only during a short fraction of an rf - period .",
    "this occurs , when the potential on the powered electrode is sufficiently negative to supply enough kinetic energy to the electrons . upon additional negative biasing of an ae - pixel , the necessary energy for crossing the sheath increases",
    "this results in a further reduction of the electron density since for most electrons the sheath becomes impenetrable .",
    "having lost their kinetic energy already after some part of the sheath , they remain trapped in the plasma .",
    "hence , above the negatively biased pixel , parts of the sheath may be completely deprived of electrons . because of the continuity equation and acceleration of the ions towards the ae , their ( time - averaged ) density also decreases in the sheath .",
    "their larger mass makes them less susceptible to further acceleration by additional biasing and therefore all ion densities nearly coincide .",
    "in contrast to switching off the plasma , which leads to wider final potential structures and weaker fields , a negative bias may drastically enhance the electric field in the sheath .",
    "this enhancement results from the dominance of the increased potential difference over the effect of sheath widening .     in the bulk and the sheath of the discharge .",

    "away from the biased pixels , the eepf in region @xmath59 agrees for all ae configurations . ]",
    "the density profile does not contain any information on the energy of the electrons in the sheath .",

    "the scales used in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_eepf ] are chosen such that a maxwellian distribution results in a straight line .",
    "then the electron temperature is proportional to the inverse slope and the crossing with the ordinate gives the species density .",
    "the obtained @xmath61 for the bulk closely resembles a bi - maxwellian distribution with a larger fraction of cold and and a smaller fraction of higher energetic electrons .",
    "the latter one is due to those electrons that oscillate between the electrodes of the discharge . in the sheath",
    ", the density is reduced for all energies , but most pronounced in the high energy tail .",
    "this is due to the retardation caused by the potential difference the electrons encounter when crossing the sheath . as compared to the unperturbed sheath , @xmath61 above the center pixel clearly reflects the influence of the additional ae - biasing ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : local_eepf ] ) . for energies up to the plasma potential , the density reduction ( enhancement ) for negative ( positive ) bias is uniform for all energies .",
    "the strong fluctuations at larger energies are due to poor statistics since only a tiny fraction of all electrons have energies in this range .",
    "irrespective of the biasing on the center pixel , the confinement potential on the third shell of pixels increases the density in the high energy tail as compared to the unperturbed sheath through a channeling effect .     on the particle as extracted from the experimental trajectory .",

    "[ fig : iondrag ] .",

    "the large dc - bias applied to the ae pixel locally dominates the characteristics of the sheath and masks the rf - character of the global discharge there .",
