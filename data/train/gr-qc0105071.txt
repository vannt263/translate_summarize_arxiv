    "although orthonormal ( cartesian and lorentz ) coordinate systems are the easiest to understand , they are not always the easiest to use to solve a given problem .",
    "an approximately infinite straight line wire antenna , for example , is far easier to analyze in a cylindrical coordinate system than a cartesian one .",
    "more complicated coordinate systems ( examples include spherical and toroidal systems ) are also often used to make geometrically complex problems tractable . and in the most general case",
    ", one can imagine , as einstein did with his coordinate `` mollusk '' , a collection of grid lines spread throughout space in a somewhat haphazard manner , crossing one another in no particular pattern , and having widely varying degrees of spacing between lines .    in such non - orthonormal systems , called",
    "_ generalized coordinate _",
    "systems , the grid lines are numbered sequentially as 0,1,2,3 , ... , so one can always pinpoint one s location by specifying the number of the grid lines where one is located . unlike orthonormal systems , however , these numbers do not directly reflect one s distance from the origin .",
    "if i am on a 2d flat surface at the intersection of generalized coordinate grid lines numbered 3 and 4 , my coordinate location is ( 3,4 ) , but i am not 3 physically measured meters ( we will use meters as our measuring unit ) from location ( 0,4 ) . depending on the spacing of the lines",
    "i could be 1 meter , 100 meters , a 1/2 meter , or any physical distance at all from ( 0,4 ) .",
    "i can , of course , determine that distance experimentally by measuring it directly with a series of meter sticks laid end to end .",
    "but is there any way i can determine it analytically from my coordinate location values ?    before we begin our answer to that question , consider another situation where i wish to measure the speed of an object , but i can only count the number of grid lines the object passes by per second in my non - cartesian system . how could i translate that speed into the speed i would measure using standard physical meter sticks instead of grid lines ?",
    "the first speed ( grid lines per second ) is a _",
    "coordinate speed_. it is relative to the coordinate system we use .",
    "different spacing of the grid lines means a different number of lines passed per second , and that means a different coordinate speed .",
    "the second speed ( meters per second = standard meter sticks passed per second ) is unique , however .",
    "it is the same regardless of the amount of squeezing or spreading out of our gridlines .",
    "physical speed_.    each component of the velocity vector equals the speed in a given coordinate axis direction .",
    "if these components are in terms of grid lines per second , they are called _ coordinate components _ of velocity .",
    "if they are in terms of meter sticks per second , they are called _ physical components . _ for the special case where our coordinate grid is cartesian ( or lorentzian ) , these components are identical , i.e. , coordinate components equal the physical components we would measure .",
    "solutions to problems are typically found in terms of the coordinate system used , and hence are coordinate component solutions .",
    "but for non - orthonormal coordinates , we need to be able to relate those components to the values we would actually measure in experiment . in other words , we need to know how to find physical components from coordinate components .    though widely used in applied mechanics@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath2@xcite , the method for doing this is rarely taught in general relativity courses and seemingly known to but a small minority of physicists .",
    "in fact , the author knows of only a single relativity text ( misner , thorne , and wheeler@xcite ) where the subject is even mentioned .",
    "this seeming oversight is probably due , in some measure , to the fact that invariant quantities are often those measured in experiments .",
    "for example , the time dilation experienced by a particle in a cyclotron is the proper time _",
    "@xmath3 _ for that particle , and this is the same ( invariant ) for any coordinate system ( orthonormal or not ) used to calculate it .",
    "however , there are situations in which vector or tensor components ( rather than invariant quantities ) are measured , and since these can be different from the theoretically determined coordinate components , we need to be able to deduce the former from the latter .",
    "this article provides an introduction to physical components , explains how they can be calculated , and illustrates their utility with two examples .",
    "one of these provides an answer to a question many students are commonly perplexed by .",
    "that is , `` is the speed of light in a non - inertial ( general relativistic ) frame equal to @xmath0 ? ''",
    "readers with marginal background in general relativity may wish to read the present more elementary and pedagogic section on physical components , and then skip to section [ sec : mylabel1 ] .",
    "sections [ sec : mylabel2 ] and [ sec : illustrating ] use greater mathematical rigor to draw the same conclusions as section [ sec : physical ] and cover more advanced topics such as tensor analysis .",
    "we begin this section by refining the concept of generalized coordinates , i.e. , those which may be other than cartesian ( or lorentzian . )",
    "note that generalized coordinates are by custom labeled with superscripts .",
    "that is , instead of three dimensions labeled x , y , and z , or x@xmath4x@xmath5 , and x@xmath6 , we use x@xmath7 , x@xmath8 , and x@xmath9 . raising to a power",
    "is indicated using parenthesis , i.e. , ( x@xmath7)@xmath8 .    to avoid confusion we deal solely with flat spaces until noted otherwise .",
    "consider the 2d flat space ( no time dimension for the present ) of figure 1 .",
    "grid lines are numbered sequentially with integers .",
    "if we use a cartesian coordinate system with @xmath10 and @xmath11 grid lines spaced one standard meter stick apart , then the distance _ ds _ between any two ( infinitesimally close ) points is found from the pythagorean theorem    @xmath12    where _ _",
    "dx__@xmath7 and _ _ dx__@xmath13 values equal physical ( standard ) meter stick distances in orthogonal directions .",
    "the reader should not be confused by the somewhat loose identification of the infinitesimal `` @xmath14 '' in this discussion with the finite difference `` @xmath15 '' in the finite size figures .",
    "if , as in figure 2 , we change the grid line spacing to form a different , non - cartesian , coordinate grid ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) for the same flat space , then distances between successive @xmath16 and @xmath18 grid lines are no longer one meter stick .",
    "so in the new grid , successive lines are still labeled as @xmath16=1 , @xmath16=2 , @xmath16=3 , etc , but the distances between successive @xmath16 ( and @xmath18 ) grid lines are no longer one meter .",
    "for example , the distance between the @xmath16=1 and @xmath16=2 lines is not one meter , even though @xmath19=1 between those lines .",
    "so _ _ dx__@xmath20and _ _ dx__@xmath8 values equal number of grid lines between points , _ not _ physical meter stick distances ( i.e. , not number of meters ) between the points , and the form of ( [ eq1 ] ) for the new coordinates no longer holds .",
    "that is , for _ ds _ equal to the distance in meters between the same two points ,    @xmath21    we therefore modify ( [ eq1 ] ) to    @xmath22    where g@xmath23 and g@xmath24 must be chosen such that ( [ eq1 ] ) remains valid , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy    @xmath27    or more simply ,    @xmath28    in both ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) _ ds _ is the same distance ( in meter stick lengths ) between the same two points ( _ ds _ is invariant between coordinate systems ) , and each expression is called the _ line element _ between the two points for that particular coordinate grid .",
    "the term generalized coordinates is used for such non - cartesian coordinates because the coordinate grid ( @xmath29,@xmath18 ) is completely arbitrary ( general ) . the quantity @xmath30 ( @xmath31= 1,2 )",
    "is known as the _ metric _ of the coordinate grid .",
    "note that for different generalized coordinate grids ( @xmath16,@xmath18 ) , there will be different values for @xmath30 .      _",
    "_ dx__@xmath32 in ( [ eq5 ] ) are physically measured values ( i.e. , they are the number of meter sticks one would find physically by measuring in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions ) , and hence they are unique . the quantities _",

    "in particular , we find physical components ( those measured experimentally ) in the same manner , i.e. , with ( [ eq6 ] ) , for any vector quantity in either a flat or non - flat space .      in special relativity ,",

    "_ represents _ coordinate time _ , which is an arbitrarily defined time ( just as our spatial coordinate grids were arbitrarily defined ) generally different from the physical time one would measure experimentally with standard clocks .",
    "use of coordinate time can simplify the solution of many problems .",
    "it can be visualized in a 3d connotation as a set of clocks that run at rates different than standard ( physical ) clocks and that are distributed at every point in our generalized 3d coordinate grid . in a 4d connotation ,",
    "coordinate time can be visualized as a set of grid lines whose labels increment sequentially in the time direction , but which do not correspond to one second between grid lines .",
    "physical time is found from coordinate time in analogous fashion to ( [ eq5 ] ) or ( [ eq6 ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath47    note that by substituting the coordinate component values of ( [ eq5 ] ) [ incorporating the third spatial dimension ] and ( [ eq10 ] ) into ( [ eq9 ] ) , we get ( [ eq8 ] ) , where the components in ( [ eq8 ] ) are physical components for an observer at rest in the generalized grid system .",
    "since ( [ eq8 ] ) represents a special relativistic , or lorentz , coordinate system we can conclude the following .",

    "this and the following section are intended for readers having a reasonable foundation in general relativity . in particular , such readers should already be familiar with the concept of basis vectors and the metric identity    @xmath49    where * * e**@xmath50 is a generalized coordinate basis vector .",
    "the displacement vector @xmath14**x * * between two points in a 2d cartesian coordinate system is    @xmath51    where the @xmath52 are unit basis vectors and _ _ dx__@xmath53 are physical components . for the same vector @xmath14**x * * expressed in a different , generalized , coordinate system we have different coordinate components _ _ dx__@xmath54 _ _ dx__@xmath55 , but a similar expression    @xmath56    where the generalized basis vectors * * e**@xmath57point in the same directions as the corresponding unit basis vectors @xmath58 , but are not equal to them .",
    "hence , for @xmath59 , we have    @xmath60    where we used ( [ eq11 ] ) to get the rhs . in general , we have    @xmath61    where again , underlining implies no summation .    substituting ( [ eq15 ] ) into ( [ eq12 ] ) and equating with ( [ eq13 ] ) , one obtains    @xmath62    which is the same relationship between displacement physical and coordinate components as ( [ eq5 ] ) .    consider a more general case of an arbitrary vector * v *    @xmath63    where , * * e**@xmath64 and * * e**@xmath5 here do not , in general , have to be orthogonal , * * e**@xmath65 and @xmath66 point in the same direction for each index @xmath67 , and as before , carets over component indices indicate physical components . substituting ( [ eq15 ] ) into ( [ eq17 ] ) , one readily obtains    @xmath68    which is the same as ( [ eq6 ] ) , and which we have shown here to be valid in both orthogonal and non - orthogonal systems .    in consonance with the above , many authors@xcite note that the physical component of any vector in a given direction is merely the projection of that vector onto that direction , i.e. , the inner product of the vector with a unit vector in the given direction .",
    "this is simply the component of the vector in a basis having a unit basis vector pointing in that direction .",
    "if we apply this prescription by taking the dot product of @xmath59with * v * of ( [ eq17 ] ) , then use ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , we end up with ( [ eq18 ] ) for @xmath67=1 .",
    "this is obviously generalized to any index @xmath67 .    as a further aid to those readers familiar with anholonomic coordinates ( which superimpose unit basis vectors on a generalized coordinate grid ) , we reference eringens@xcite",
    "comment `` .. the anholonomic components .. of a ... vector ... are identical to [ physical components ] '' .",
    "following similar logic to that used in section [ sec : physical ] , one sees ( [ eq18 ] ) is valid locally in curved , as well as flat , spaces , and can be extrapolated to 4d general relativistic applications .",
    "so , very generally , for a 4d vector @xmath69    @xmath70    where roman sub and superscripts refer solely to spatial components ( i.e. @xmath67 = 1,2,3 . )",
    "as the reader of this section is no doubt aware , coordinate displacement vector components _",
    "_ dx__@xmath71(or _ _ dx__@xmath72 in relativity theory ) are _ contravariant _ components , as are the components of the vector expressed in ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "a similar derivation to that shown above carried out for _ covariant _ components leads to the following relationship between covariant coordinate components and covariant physical components    @xmath73      considering second order tensors as open , or dyadic , products of vectors , with each tensor component having two basis vectors associated with it , one can use the general methodology of sub - section [ subsec : mylabel3 ] to derive the following relationships    @xmath74    as a first sample application of physical components , consider the 4d electromagnetic tensor @xmath75 containing as components the electric and magnetic induction fields * e * and * * b**@xcite@xmath2@xcite*. * assume a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath76,z ) with a field in the axial @xmath77 direction measured to be @xmath78 ( subscript for `` measured '' ) and with no other electric or magnetic field components .",
    "the physical ( measured ) component of the magnetic induction in the @xmath77 direction is @xmath78 , and the corresponding term in the @xmath75 tensor is the @xmath79 = @xmath80 , @xmath81 = @xmath82 component .",
    "hence ,    @xmath83    the metric for a cylindrical coordinate system has @xmath84= 1 and @xmath85 = @xmath86 . using these with _ _ _ _ ( [ eq21 ] ) , we then find the generalized tensor component , which should be used in any tensor analysis of the problem in cylindrical coordinates , to be    @xmath87    we note that tensor analysis must be carried out with coordinate components ( @xmath88 here ) , not physical components ( i.e. , not @xmath89 . ) fung@xcite observes that `` ... physical components ... do not transform according to the tensor transformation laws and are not components of tensors . ''",
    "hence , at the beginning of an analysis we must first convert known measured ( physical ) component values to coordinate component values",
    ". then we carry out the vector / tensor analysis . as a final step , in order to compare our results with experiment , we convert the coordinate component answer to physical component form .",
    "the import of physical and coordinate values for both contravariant and covariant components can be visualized graphically .",
    "we start with two purely spatial sets of coordinate grid lines ( @xmath16,@xmath18 ) , which are quite arbitrary , and in this case , are not orthogonal .",
    "the contravariant component representation of a certain vector * v * is shown in figure 3 ; the covariant representation for the same vector in figure 4 .",

    "covariant basis vectors * * e**@xmath50 ( figure 3 ) for use with contravariant components are defined as , for example ,    @xmath90    where @xmath91is the unit vector in the direction of * * e**@xmath5 .",

    ", @xmath98 is obviously not diagonal , as @xmath99 .",
    "contravariant basis vectors * * e**@xmath100 ( called _ one - forms _ typically in general relativity ) are defined , with a purpose in mind , by the relation    @xmath101    with ( [ eq26 ] ) we get the contravariant basis vectors ( or one - forms ) shown in figure 4 .",

    "the number of unit vectors needed in the * * e**@xmath8 direction is not the same as that in the * * e**@xmath5 direction .",
    "consider now the interesting case of spacetime around a star or black hole possessing angular momentum in which time is not orthogonal to space , i.e. time - space cross terms exist in the metric . in this case , instead of being spatial , our * * e**@xmath5 direction in figure 3 can be thought of as representing time .",
    "so wherever we have used a `` 2 '' sub or super script , now think of it as a `` 0 '' .",

    "of course , for lorentz frames it does nt matter . and",

    "therefore , four - velocity is , in the strictest sense , a contravariant vector since it equals _",
    "_ dx__@xmath109/d@xmath3 .",
    "although it is immaterial in lorentz frames whether one uses contravariant or covariant components , and it is immaterial in any to frame whether one uses contravariant or covariant _ physical _ components , it is critically important in nto frames to use contravariant 4-vectors for displacement and velocity",
    ".    it will not matter in any case for invariants .",
    "they are not components of vectors or tensors , and will come out the same in any coordinates , in any kind of frame .",
    "however , for experimentally measured quantities that are components of a vector or tensor in an nto frame , one must use physical components of the correct covariant or contravariant form .",
    "note that while physical values are not invariant between frames , within a given frame , they are unique .",
    "they equal what an observer in that frame would measure .",
    "with an understanding of the difference between physical and coordinate components , one can now unravel the widespread confusion ( in the author s experience at least ) over the value of the speed of light in a gravitational field .    in a non - inertial ( general relativistic ) frame ,",
