    "we consider a realistic optomechanical system , composed of a high @xmath3 fabry - prot cavity of length @xmath4 , with a fixed mirror and a movable nano mechanical resonator ( mr ) .",
    "specifically , the mechanical resonator consists of two charged mrs , where the @xmath5 of the optomechanical cavity couples to the cavity field via radiation pressure , as well as electrostatically coupled to another movable oscillator outside the cavity ( i.e. , mr@xmath6 ) through the tunable coulomb coupling strength , viz . @xmath7 .",

    "we show that by exploiting the electromechanical coupling @xmath0 in the hybrid qoems , high dispersion is acquired .    in order to examine the quantitative features of the probe propagation with subject to the electromechanical coupling @xmath0 , we present the group delay @xmath95 versus the pump power @xmath92 in fig .

    "a positive group delay indicates a slow light in the transmitted probe field in the presence of @xmath0 as expected .",
    "we note that : _",

    "surprisingly , we see that with increase in @xmath101 , the magnitude of delay increases , which reflects that our slow light regime is robust against the cavity decay rate , which is seldom reported before .",

    "light confirms the basis of cavity optomechanics and theory of radiation pressure .",
    "this can be understood as follows : under the constant coulomb interaction and the constant drive ( pump field ) , the equilibrium position follows the strain of the mr . with the increase in @xmath101 , the radiation pressure on mr@xmath8 decreases , while both the mrs will acquire large displacement to provide large strain in order to compensate the reduced radiation pressure @xcite .",

    "form fig .",
    "[ tr2](a ) , it can be seen that transparency window broadens and becomes more transparent by increasing the optomechanical coupling , in agreement with previous reports @xcite . nevertheless , it reflects that our approach is an extension of previously reported single - ended cavities , here our motivation is to acquire a tunable switch that permits us to explicitly control both slow light and fast light propagation in the probe transmission . in fig .",
    "[ tr2](b ) , we plot the phase as a function of normalized probe detuning .",
    "note that , the phase of the probe field suffers a steep negative dispersion around @xmath111 , as shown in fig .",

    "the group delay is negative , which reveals that we observe the fast light propagation ( pulse advancement ) in the transmitted probe field , when @xmath0 is switched off . from figure  [ ph2 ]",
    ", it can be seen that for decrease in @xmath101 , magnitude of pulse advancement increases .",

    "this clarifies the advantage of our scheme in contrast to the earlier reports @xcite .",
    "the following conclusions apply to our reported work : ( i ) by utilizing the hybridization of optomechanical and electromechanical systems , we report that both slow and fast light behaviors can be achieved in a single hybrid experimental setup .",
