    "morphological classification of galaxies was originally envisaged as a tool for studying the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , hubble 1936 ) .",
    "much like other fields of science , as the amount of data grew the classifications were revised and became more and more refined ( sandage 1961 ; de vaucouleurs 1959 ; van den bergh 1960 , 1976 ) . at some point",
    "the question arose as to how well those refinements correlate with physical quantities and processes within galaxies . in an excellent review , roberts & haynes ( 1994 )",
    "show that morphological types in the local universe do correlate with color , hi mass and other quantities _ in the mean _ , but there is a large scatter about the mean .",
    "this implies that morphological classification has become overly refined , at least as far as its relation to physical properties is concerned .",
    "a major limitation of most classification schemes for galaxies is that they were devised solely using samples of nearby galaxies , due to the lack of imaging capabilities at higher redshifts .",
    "this situation has changed with the advent of the hubble space telescope and very large ground based telescopes .",
    "the morphology of large numbers of galaxies at moderate redshifts ( @xmath2 ) is now available , and preliminary results ( griffiths _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; glazebrook _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) indicate that many galaxies at moderate redshifts do not fit comfortably on the hubble sequence .",
    "it is an obvious challenge to try and incorporate galaxies at different redshifts into one coherent scheme .",
    "a lot of work has been done recently on morphological classification of faint galaxy images .",
    "most of it , however , relies on eyeball classifications : cowie _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) present deep i band wfpc2 images of a k selected sample .",
    "they give a qualitative , eyeball account of the change they see in the morphology of galaxies around @xmath3 .",
    "( 1995 ) divide galaxies in a deep wfpc2 field into three eyeball classes and analyse the number counts as a function of type .",
    "van den bergh it et al .",
    "( 1996 ) produced a morphological catalogue of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , which was again based on eyeball classifications .",
    "in addition , they supply two quantitative parameters for those galaxies ( light concentration and asymmetry ) , which allow for a more objective analysis .",
    "( 1996 ) use both eyeball classifications and trained artificial neural networks to obtain classifications for galaxies in deep hst fields .",
    "their network utilizes parameters derived from surface brightness profiles in u , b , v and i filters .",
    "the move from pure eyeball classification to automated classification using objective parameters has been inevitable , due to the large quantities of images that have become available over the past few years .",
    "the parameters used by van den bergh _ et al . _ ( 1996 ) proved to be a useful first step in this direction , although they gave a very crude separation of eyeball types . using light profile parameters odewahn _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) discuss the possible makeup of the population of blue galaxies .",
    "both of these papers tie their quantitative parameters to classifications on the existing hubble sequence , which is apparently insufficient for the full range of morphologies detected with hst .",
    "since the hubble sequence appears too refined on the one hand , and not general enough on the other , we suggest a more general approach here . in recognition of the fact that morphology is a continuous quantity we abandon any attempt to tag each galaxy with a specific type .",
    "instead , we use a space spanned by four morphological parameters , which was introduced elsewhere ( naim _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , and examine the distribution of various populations of galaxies in it .",
    "we start with a large , complete , magnitude - limited sample of hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images , which is described in   2 .",
    "we have little prior knowledge of the distributions of galaxies in this space .",
    "for this reason we use a variant of an _ unsupervised learning _ technique called self organizing maps ( soms ) .",
    "it allows data taken from a space of high dimensionality to organize themselves into a two dimensional `` histogram '' while retaining most of the topology .",
    "the resulting map can then be plotted and analyzed .",
    "soms , which are explained in detail in   3 , therefore combine non - linear clustering with a dimension - reduction technique .",
    "soms have been little used in astronomy to date ( the one example we are aware of is mhnen & hakala 1995 ) and , as we show below , prove a valuable tool for unsupervised data analysis .",
    "however , one important point has to be stressed from the outset : we are using a non - parametric method here , in the sense that the results are not described in terms of functional dependencies between the parameters we use .",
    "consequently , the soms are primarily a _ diagnostic tool _",
    ", which should be used only as a first step towards forming a model that explains the observations .",
    "its most important feature is the ability to identify special populations that merit closer examination .",
    "we first demonstrate the application of soms to a synthetic dataset (   4 ) and then apply them to the sample of hst galaxies (   5 ) .",
    "the discussion follows in ",
    "it is easiest to select a suitable , large sample from data that were collected uniformly .",
    "the 27 contiguous fields of the groth - westphal strip ( groth _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) make an excellent such collection .",
    "i band ( f814w ) images were preferred over v band ( f606w ) images ( which are also available for the same fields ) for two reasons : first , exposures in i were about @xmath4 longer and typically resulted in higher signal - to - noise ratio images ; second , at the expected redshifts of these galaxies the i filter corresponds roughly to the rest frame b band , for which most existing morphological schemes were defined , while the v filter corresponds to a much bluer rest frame band in which images appear much more broken up .",
    "our indications from previous work ( naim _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) are that down to an isophotal magnitude of @xmath5 a distinction between morphologically `` normal '' and `` peculiar '' galaxies is still possible , although it suffers increasingly from effects of noise towards the faint end .",
    "we decided to go for the same limit here and then examine a higher signal - to - noise subset of the sample , to see what effect the noise had on our results .",
    "there were 3391 images brighter than @xmath6 in the groth - westphal strip .",
    "the mds pipeline , using a maximum likelihood method ( ratnatunga _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , fits simple photometric models ( @xmath7 law , exponential disk and combinations of the two ) to galaxy images .",
    "it was found that the fitted half light radius parameter is very useful in separating stars and compact objects from galaxies , and the limiting value was empirically set at @xmath8 arcsec ( 1 image pixel ) .",
    "it is clear that some distant galaxies as well as closer compact objects have half light radii smaller than this limit .",
    "therefore , not all of the 421 images which were removed from the sample due to failing this test are indeed stars .",
    "however , images whose half light radius is smaller than @xmath8 arcsec are typically no more than 3 - 4 pixels across , thus containing almost no morphological information .",
    "consequently , we use this cutoff not only as a safeguard against contamination by stars but also as a practical lower limit for the derivation of our parameters . on top of the 421 images mentioned above",
    ", less than 20 other images were rejected by the program which calculates the morphological parameters , due to low quality ( e.g. , too high a fraction of missing pixels ) . during classifications by eye ( see below ) several more ( less than 20 ) images were rejected due to other problems ( e.g. , a nearby star overlaps the galaxy ) .",
    "the final sample contains 2934 entries .",
    "isophotal magnitudes are tightly correlated with the _ integrated _ signal - to - noise index , @xmath9 , which is calculated by summing the individual signal - to - noise ratios @xmath10 over image pixels .",
    "see ratnatunga _",
    "_ 1997 for details ) .",
    "note that since it is the _ integrated _ signal - to - noise the values we are dealing with are typically of order @xmath11 . at the limiting magnitude of @xmath5 all but six galaxies in the sample have @xmath12 , which is incidentally the limit below which no disk+bulge photometric model fit was attempted by the maximum - likelihood software ( although pure bulge and pure disk models are attempted down to much lower values ) .",
    "a full description of the four parameters we use was given in naim _ et al . _",
    "we therefore give only a brief description of them here . in designing these parameters we attempted to give as full a description as possible of the features that stand out in galaxy images , while remaining neutral with respect to quantities such as the underlying photometric model or the color of the image .",
    "our parameters are :    1 .",
    "blobbiness : the degree to which bright pixels stand out , accentuating bright localized structure .",
    "this parameter may be related to regions of intense star formation .",
    "briefly , this parameter is calculated for each bright image pixel as the fraction of brighter pixels out of the total number of pixels in a semi - circular environment around it .",
    "isophotal center displacement : the displacement of geometrical centers of various isophotes from each other , as a measure of overall asymmetry .",
    "this parameter may be related to merging histories by detecting tidal tails .",
    "3 .   isophotal filling factor : the fraction of pixels belonging to a certain isophote out of the number of pixels in the ellipse enclosing that isophote .",
    "this is a measure of overall structure : in featureless images this fraction is expected to be higher than in images exhibiting a lot of structure , because in the latter bright pixels will be found at higher radii , making the enveloping ellipse much bigger .",
    "this expectation is verified for an eyeballed subset of our sample ( naim _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , see also below ) , in which late spirals and peculiars average a value of less than @xmath13 for this parameter , early spirals average close to @xmath14 and ellipticals / lenticulars average over @xmath15 .",
    "skeleton ratio of detected structures , indicating how elongated the structures are .",
    "briefly , for detected structures in the galaxy image , this is the fraction of pixels making up the `` backbone '' of the structure to the total number of pixels in that structure .",
    "the first three parameters are evaluated from the raw i band image while the fourth is derived from the residual image , which is left after subtracting the best fit photometric model ( from the maximum - likelihood software ) .",
    "the motivation behind self organizing maps ( soms ) derives from the inability to plot data in more than three dimensions .",
    "kohonen ( 1989 ) suggested a non - linear mapping from a given @xmath16-dimensional space ( @xmath17 ) onto a two dimensional map , in a way that maintains as much as possible of the topology of the higher dimension space .",
    "soms are therefore one implementation of _ unsupervised learning _ , a generic name referring to methods for describing data without any prior knowledge of how they cluster .",
    "self organization takes place in an iterative manner with little user intervention . the role played by the user",
    "is reduced to defining the organizing criterion ( i.e. , the criterion determining which vector is mapped to which node in the som ) .",
    "the resulting map can be regarded as a two - dimensional histogram , although its axes do not carry the usual parametric meaning .",
    "the numbers on the @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes represent positions in the map , not values of the @xmath16 parameters making up the space of the data .",
    "let a given dataset contain @xmath20 vectors of dimension @xmath16 , each describing a single object ( e.g. , a galaxy ) .",
    "in the case of our galaxy sample , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the `` data - space '' is therefore @xmath16-dimensional .",
    "define the map as a two - dimensional array of discrete nodes . throughout this paper",
    "we use square maps of size @xmath23 nodes .",
    "the nodes occupy positions in what we refer to as the ( two - dimensional ) `` map space '' .",
    "the link between the two spaces is realized by assigning each node of the map an @xmath16-dimensional `` characteristic '' vector from the data - space .",
    "note that this assignment is done in an automated way , with no input from the user , i.e. , it is truly an unsupervised operation .",
    "the key measure in the process of self - organization is distance .",
    "distances are calculated within each of the spaces independently . for better clarity",
    "we will refer to them in what follows as data - distance and map - distance , respectively .",
    "the user s role is confined to choosing a certain distance measure ( e.g. , the @xmath24 norm , also known as the euclidean distance ) , which serves as the organizing criterion .",
    "each object in the dataset is mapped to the node whose characteristic vector is closest to it in the sense of that distance measure ( the `` winning '' node ) . in each iteration of the training process",
    "the entire dataset is mapped to the som and then the characteristic vectors of the nodes are updated according to the objects mapped onto them .",
    "topology is preserved by allowing nodes in the vicinity of the winning node to be updated as well . over many iterations",
    "this will cause nodes which lie close to each other to obtain similar characteristic vectors , and therefore eventually whole regions in the som will correspond to specific populations in the dataset . while nearby nodes will represent finer details within each population ,",
    "nodes far away from each other will represent significantly different populations .",
    "the iterations are stopped once some convergence criterion ( see below ) is met .",
    "normally one initializes the map nodes to have random characteristic vectors at first .",
    "however , this could assign very different vectors to adjacent nodes , while similar vectors could be found far from each other .",
    "this could result in two different populations of galaxies overlapping in the resulting som , or with a single population being artificially split between two or more regions in the map .",
    "it has been suggested that the first problem could be overcome by running the som several times , each time starting with a different set of random characteristic vectors , and choosing only the `` best '' run , e.g. , in the sense of minimizing the @xmath25 difference between all objects and the characteristic vectors of the nodes to which they were mapped . however , since this is not a supervised learning process , there may be many very different minima of this measure , each corresponding to a different topology , with little to choose between them .",
    "in addition , this solution does not answer the second problem we raise .",
    "furthermore , randomizing the initial characteristic vectors makes the entire process unrepeatable .    in order to avoid these difficulties we first run a simple clustering algorithm ( sca ) on the data , and use the emerging crude clusters to decide how to initialize the map vectors .",
    "our version of the som algorithm consists of two stages : in the startup phase we employ the sca to get a rough idea of how the objects cluster .",
    "the sca initially defines each object in the dataset as an independent `` group '' in data - space . the @xmath24 norm ( euclidean distance )",
    "is adopted as the data - distance measure , and a search radius is defined , which increases linearly with the number of iterations . in each iteration groups",
    "whose centers of mass lie within the search radius of each other are merged , and so the number of groups decreases monotonically with time .",
    "the stopping criterion for the sca is met once the three largest groups contain between them more than half of the vectors .",
    "the number was set to three because three vectors define a plane and can therefore be mapped in a topologically - faithful manner onto our two - dimensional map .",
    "note , however , that the three largest groups need not represent the most diverse combinations of the morphological parameters .",
    "for this reason we examine all groups containing more than @xmath26 of the data when the sca is stopped ( typically of order ten groups ) . out of all the vectors representing the `` centers of mass '' of these groups , we select those which contain a maximum or a minimum value of at least one of the parameters . since we are using four parameters , the number of such selected vectors ( @xmath27 ) is in the range @xmath28 $ ] , but expected to be closer to @xmath29 in most cases .",
    "the results of running the sca ( and any other crude clustering algorithm ) over a given dataset are expected to be quite independent of the exact details of the algorithm .",
    "different distance measures may result in somewhat different results but since we are using the sca only as the first stage in our analysis , such differences are not important for the final outcome .    in the second stage we iterate through all possibilities of selecting three so - called `` anchors '' out of these @xmath27 vectors to initialize and train the som .",
    "the selected vectors are assigned to three nodes in the map in a way that conserves their relative data - distances .",
    "all other nodes _ within the triangle enclosed by these anchors _ are then assigned characteristic vectors that are weighted averages of these three key vectors , the weight being the inverse of the map - distance from each anchor - node :    @xmath30    where for @xmath31 is one of the three key characteristic vectors and @xmath32 is the map - distance between node @xmath33 and the node in which that key vector resides . only the region inside the triangle is used .",
    "this procedure allows the map nodes to span much of the variance in the data from the outset , and guarantees the repeatability of the results .",
    "we select only three anchors because , again , three points define a plane and can therefore be mapped in topologically - faithful manner onto the two dimensional map . choosing all possible combinations of three vectors for the role of anchors allows us to search for the combination that best represents the data , in an unsupervised way . repeatability is guaranteed because the entire process is deterministic and does not require input from the user .",
    "next comes self - organization .",
    "we again adopt the @xmath24 norm as our data - distance measure .",
    "for each data vector @xmath34 ( describing one galaxy ) the winning node is node @xmath33 for which the data - distance between its characteristic vector @xmath35 and the data vector @xmath34 is minimal .",
    "this distance is given by :    @xmath36    once the entire dataset has been mapped to the som the characteristic vectors of every node are updated .",
    "there are two possible sources of contribution to the update of a given node : one is due to all the objects that were mapped directly onto that node ; and the other is due to the objects mapped to nearby nodes , which affect that node by virtue of the attempt to conserve topology .",
    "let @xmath37 be the average of all vectors mapped onto node @xmath33 .",
    "then the first contribution is of the form :    @xmath38    and the contributions of the second kind will come from nodes @xmath39 around node @xmath33 and will each have the form :    @xmath40~ \\cdot ~\\langle                                      { \\bf v}^{(i_1,j_1 ) } \\rangle $ $ $ ]    where @xmath41 is the map - distance between @xmath33 and @xmath39 .",
    "the `` environment kernel '' chosen here is a gaussian whose width , @xmath42 , is a decreasing function of the number of iterations @xmath43",
    ":    @xmath44    the reason for the dependence of @xmath42 on the number of iterations is that as the structure of the map becomes more organized it is desirable to limit the effect of the environment .",
    "if the other nodes were always allowed to contribute at the same level the process of self - organization might never converge and finer details in the map could be washed away . for practical purposes of reducing the number of calculations , the environment of node @xmath33 from which the nodes @xmath39 are taken is limited to a square of side 7 ( i.e. , vertical / horizontal map - distance of no more than 3 ) centered on node @xmath33 .",
    "there is no need to go any further , because even when @xmath42 is maximal at 1 ( during the first iteration ) , the coefficient @xmath45 drops to about @xmath46 at a map - distance of 3 , and therefore nodes further away from @xmath33 are unlikely to contribute to it significantly .",
    "the updated value of the characteristic vector of node @xmath33 is therefore given by :    @xmath47 } } $ $ $ ]    where the denominator in the second term is the normalization of all the weighted contributions , and @xmath48 is a parameter which describes the `` learning rate '' of the som .",
    "we set @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "it is not advised to make @xmath48 large because then the changes in the characteristic vectors can become erratic .    at the end of each iteration",
    "we monitor the root mean square difference between the current and previous characteristic vector of each node .",
    "we stop training the map when the largest of these differences has dropped below @xmath50 of its maximal possible value .",
    "typically this leads to convergence within several thousand iterations",
    ".    self organization is repeated for all selections of three anchors . for each such selection",
    "all the vectors in the dataset are mapped onto the trained som and the @xmath25 difference between the data vectors and the characteristic vectors of the nodes to which they were mapped is monitored to find the best triplet .",
    "the som resulting from the best triplet is then chosen as the best overall som .",
    "we test the ability of the som to handle non - linear mapping in multi - dimensions by first defining a curve in a space of the same dimensionality as our galaxy dataset . in order to demonstrate the ability of the som to retain topological information ,",
    "the curve is specified in parametric form .",
    "this conveys a clear notion of the order of points along the curve .",
    "the curve is given by :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the free parameter .",
    "we choose five points along the curve , corresponding to @xmath52 values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "around each point we randomly scatter 400 points .",
    "there is little overlap between these five clouds of points and the relations between any two of the components of @xmath55 are all non - linear .",
    "the som software is trained on a dataset containing all 2000 points and the results are shown in figure 1 . the top left panel shows the mapping of the full dataset , and there appear to be three to five distinct concentrations .",
    "the other five panels each depict one group of points ( denoted by the corresponding value of @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is plain to see that the som _ maintains the order of the groups along the curve _ , although some mixing between adjacent groups takes place .",
    "the som is therefore capable of mapping non - linear datasets while conserving much of the topology .",
    "note also that although the initialization of the som is in the form of a triangle , in this case it is an obtuse angle triangle , closely resembling the true shape of the distribution of points in the original space - that of a one dimensional curve in a four dimensional space .",
    "one possible drawback of this representation is that close to the vertices of the triangular region groups tend to be more concentrated , implying a steeper gradient in the parameters associated with vectors near the vertices .",
    "the mapping is therefore not totally faithful topologically . as mentioned above",
    ", the numbers along the axes represent positions in the map , not values of @xmath52 or any other parameters .",
    "the different panels of figure 1 show the dependence of @xmath52 on position in the map .",
    "as a preliminary step principal components analysis ( pca ) of the dataset was performed , which seeks to represent as much of the variance in the data by replacing the original axes by _ linear _",
    "combinations of them .",
    "however , the first pc only spans @xmath56 of the variance and the first two pcs span only @xmath57 of it .",
    "pca is therefore inadequate for mapping these data in two dimensions and a non - linear method is indeed required .",
    "we next proceeded to analyze the sample of 2934 galaxies with the som software .",
    "the best resulting map ( in terms of @xmath25 between the data and the nodes to which they were mapped ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "shading progresses from light for low population levels to dark for highly populated regions .",
    "although only the vertices of the triangular map were initialized with vectors corresponding to actual clusters of data points , the final map is well populated in all nodes .",
    "this shows that the som training process refines the crude results of the clustering algorithm and brings out finer structure .",
    "however , mapping the full dataset like this is not very informative without examining the characteristic vectors associated with each node . in figure 3",
    "we show four panels , each depicting the distribution of values of a single morphological parameter in the som .",
    "there are apparent trends in the parameter distributions : blobbiness is lowest around the left vertex , and grows as one moves right , especially towards the upper right .",
    "center displacement is highest in the top right vertex and decreases toward both of the other vertices .",
    "the filling factor generally grows along the same direction but then decreases again .",
    "the skeleton ratio has the clearest trend , growing strongly as one moves away from the bottom right vertex .    with the help of figure 3 one can now identify the morphologies associated with the map of figure 2 :",
    "the area of the left vertex is populated by smooth , symmetric galaxies with a high filling factor .",
    "this description corresponds to the appearance of elliptical galaxies .",
    "as one moves right towards the center of the map , two trends become apparent : towards the top right vertex galaxies are much more blobby with increasing asymmetry ( higher center displacement ) . the filling factor drops but",
    "the skeleton ratio is high , so this region should correspond to images with a lot of elongated structure , such as spiral galaxies or galaxies with tidal tails . towards the bottom",
    "right the skeleton ratio drops sharply while the values of the filling factor and the center displacement do not have a clear trend .",
    "this implies galaxies of generally `` knotty '' appearance , some of which are very asymmetric with a lot of apparent structure , while others are less asymmetric and exhibit less structure .",
    "these morphologies largely correspond to peculiar galaxies .    in order to verify the above interpretations and to study how different properties of galaxies correspond to their morphology we defined subsets of our sample according to several criteria , and mapped these subsets onto the trained som . in figure 4",
    "each panel shows the mapping of one subset , _ normalized to the total size of that subset_. this means that the intensities are relative within each panel and should not be directly compared between panels .",
    "the panels in the bottom row depict populations selected by eyeball classification .",
    "such classifications were made by one of us ( an , see naim _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) for roughly one third of the entire dataset , as a preparation to using _ supervised learning _ for these galaxies .",
    "ellipticals and s0 s are depicted in the left panel , spirals in the middle panel and peculiars in the right panel .",
    "the locations of these subsets on the map match what we expect from the analysis of the characteristic vectors above : ellipticals are mostly concentrated around the left vertex ; spirals are well spread out but appear more concentrated towards the center of the map ; peculiars are mostly found in the right hand side of the map .",
    "this morphological sequence generalizes the one dimensional hubble sequence into a two dimensional map . roughly speaking",
    ", the horizontal axis depicts mostly the change in overall smoothness and symmetry of images , while the vertical axis describes the nature and frequency of structure in the images .    the top three panels depict the distributions of galaxies in three subsets selected by apparent isophotal magnitude .",
    "the left panel depicts galaxies brighter than @xmath58 , the middle panel depicts galaxies in the range @xmath59 , and the right panel contains galaxies fainter than @xmath60 .",
    "the gaps in the ranges of apparent magnitude shown in these panels are intended to reduce the overlap and accentuate trends , since the distributions form a continuum .",
    "the same applies to the panels describing color and bulge dominance , below .",
    "however , these magnitude ranges were chosen a - priori .",
    "the magnitude limits represent a compromise between representing the full range of magnitudes and ensuring that no single bin is underpopulated .",
    "there are 278 galaxies brighter than @xmath61 , 722 in the range @xmath62 and 946 fainter than @xmath63 .",
    "the shift in the concentrations of galaxies with apparent magnitude is evident . since the redshift distribution of galaxies is a function of apparent magnitude these three panels may describe in a statistical way the evolution of galaxy morphologies with redshift .",
    "verifying this would require many spectroscopic redshifts , though , and work is in progress along these lines ( naim _ et al .",
    ", in preparation _ ) .",
    "the trend we see here is clear : at the bright end the smooth , symmetric galaxies are much more prominent than at the faint end .",
    "the panels in the second row depict subsets selected according to the only available color , @xmath64 .",
    "the left panel contains red galaxies , with ( isophotal ) @xmath65 .",
    "the middle panel contains intermediate color galaxies ( @xmath66 ) , and the right panel depicts blue galaxies ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "color appears to follow morphology , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "there is a preference of blue galaxies to occupy the upper half of the right side of the map .",
    "the third row panels describe subsets selected by bulge - to - total ratio , defined as the light contribution of the bulge component over the combined contributions of the bulge and disk components .",
    "this ratio is calculated from the maximum - likelihood fits of bulge and/or disk models to the galaxy image ( ratnatunga _ et al . _",
    "1997 contains many details about the subtleties of these fits ) .",
    "the left panel describes bulge dominated galaxies ( @xmath68 ) , the middle panel describes intermediate cases ( @xmath69 ) and the right panel depicts disk dominated galaxies ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "interestingly , the bulge - dominated galaxies appear less concentrated in the right hand side than the intermediate cases .",
    "we verify this impression in figure 5 , where we show the mean positions of five subsets , selected by @xmath71 ratios , on the trained som .",
    "the scatter around these means is considerable , but there is nevertheless a general trend of moving leftwards with increasing @xmath71 ratio , which is reversed by the last subset .",
    "this is an indication of a change in morphology among bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "closer examination of figure 2 confirms that galaxies with @xmath68 cluster in two regions , one corresponding to smooth , symmetric morphologies and one corresponding to blobby and asymmetric morphologies . this latter population has already been noted ( naim _ et al .",
    "it may correspond to the `` blue nucleated galaxies '' found in the canada - france redshift survey ( schade _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , although verifying this point requires further work .      one possible source of the apparent correlation between blobbiness and asymmetry of images on the one hand and their apparent magnitude on the other , is that as one looks at fainter images noise sets in and changes their appearance . in order to check this",
    "we show in figure 6 how galaxies of high integrated signal - to - noise index are mapped on the same trained som . while the full sample contains galaxies that virtually all have @xmath12 , the subset shown in figure 6",
    "was selected to have @xmath72 .",
    "the fraction of bright galaxies in this subset is naturally higher than in the full sample , so it is difficult to completely decouple the effect of reducing the noise from that of selecting brighter galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , while the concentrations of blobby , asymmetric galaxies appears less prominent in figure 6 , it is still a significant population . had that population been due only to noise it should have disappeared in this figure completely .",
    "we thus conclude that blobby , asymmetric galaxies indeed exist and their numbers do increase as one goes to fainter magnitudes .",
    "we turn back to figure 3 now , in order to see how noise might have affected the evaluation of our parameters .",
    "the panels describing the distributions of blobbiness , isophotal filling factor and isophotal center displacement show the trends one would expect , although finer details are also evident , allowing one or more parameters to vary slightly from one node to the next .",
    "the one problematic parameter is the skeleton ratio : while the map shows the expected small values in the region of the peculiars ( due to nearly round star - forming regions ) and higher values in the region occupied by the spirals ( due to elongated arms ) , the values are disturbingly high for ellipticals , for which one would expect no features at all ( and consequently a value of zero for the skeleton ratio ) .",
    "we note that unlike the other three parameters which were evaluated from the raw images of the galaxies , the skeleton ratio is measured from the residual images , left after the best fitted photometric model had been subtracted .",
    "the skeleton ratio is measured for features that stand out relative to the residual image , and when the residual contains no real features ( e.g. , in an elliptical ) noise may result in the `` detection '' of spurious structure .",
    "we suspect that this is the source of the relatively high skeleton ratio which characterizes nodes in the region occupied by ellipticals , but further work is needed in order to verify that these features are not real .",
    "luckily , this effect appears to influence most of the bulge - dominated , featureless galaxies in the same way , thus not disturbing their clustering properties .",
    "on the other hand , the skeleton ratio is very useful in distinguishing spirals from peculiars , and should not be discarded .",
    "it has always been important to examine individual galaxies in detail and study the processes dictating their appearance .",
    "however , for the fuller picture of galaxy evolution one requires statistical analysis .",
    "quantitative parameters are required which capture the diversity of galaxy morphologies , while not becoming too specialized or numerous . here",
    "we continue to use the set of four parameters introduced in a previous paper ( naim _ et al .",
    "however , unlike that paper , our aim here is to analyze these data in an unsupervised way , in order to learn new things .",
    "one serious difficulty that arises with even a modest number of parameters is visualizing data in more than three dimensions .",
    "we therefore make use of our variant of the kohonen self organizing map ( som ) , which allows one to cast a distribution in multi - dimensions onto a two dimensional map .",
    "our algorithm is not necessarily the best for this purpose and other algorithms exist .",
    "using soms allows us to visualize the distributions of galaxies and point out interesting populations for further study . in this respect",
    "the som is a diagnostic tool , facilitating the first step that needs to be taken with any kind of data : looking at them .",
    "we examine the som on a synthetic dataset and confirm its ability perform non - linear mapping while maintaining the correct topological order of the higher dimension space .",
    "we then apply it to our hst galaxy sample . in the resulting som galaxies cluster in several groups in morphology space .",
    "we confirm the picture which emerged from previous work ( glazebrook _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , according to which the galaxy population becomes more and more dominated by blobby , asymmetric morphologies as one goes fainter .",
    "further , we show that the colors of galaxies at moderate redshifts become significantly bluer . this could be partly due to the shift in rest - frame band as one goes to higher redshifts , but actual measured redshifts are needed in order to evaluate how much this effect contributes to the trend we see in the som .",
    "bulge dominance also appears related to morphology , the blobby galaxies being more disk dominated .",
    "however , a population of bulge - dominated galaxies with high blobbiness and asymmetry , which has been noted by supervised classification ( naim _ et al . _ 1997 ) , is rediscovered here in an independent way .",
    "note that this is achieved without any recourse to eyeball classification , i.e. , its existence can be inferred without suspecting it from the outset .",
    "bulge dominated galaxies with blue colors were also found by koo _",
    "( 1995 ) , and some of them exhibit peculiar morphologies ( e.g. , `` knots '' ) .",
    "that study was limited to a small number of galaxies and therefore no statistical conclusions can be drawn regarding the bulge dominated peculiars .",
    "( 1996 ) report the discovery of compact ( half light radius around @xmath8 arcsec ) , blue objects which are apparently sub - galactic clumps .",
    "it is possible that these clumps , once assembled more closely , give rise to the bulge dominated peculiars that we identify in our sample , although this is by no means certain .",
    "alternatively , bulge - dominated peculiars may be older galaxies caught in the process of merging with dwarf companions .",
    "we have no way of telling with current data .",
    "noise becomes progressively more important as one goes to fainter images , but our analysis shows that it can not fully account for the trends we detect .",
    "the skeleton ratio parameter is most affected by noise in smooth , symmetric images but does not significantly bias the clustering properties of that population as a whole , and is still very useful in separating two other populations ( corresponding to eyeball classes of spirals and peculiars ) . an improved version of this parameter may give better results , though .",
    "k - corrections are also of great importance at redshifts of order unity , as discussed , e.g. , by odewahn _",
    "however , we have not studied their effect on our parameters in this paper , because we only have two filters for the data presented here ( i and v ) .",
    "a study into the effect of the filters used on the measured morphological parameters is currently under way , using mds fields that were taken in three filters ( b , v and i ) .",
    "any effect the k - corrections may have on our parameters will , of course , influence the resulting som .",
    "to summarize , since morphological classification has become too refined we adopt an approach which utilizes morphology without any classification .",
    "the som succeeds in mapping different morphologies to different regions of the map , and we are encouraged by the apparent correlation of morphology with other quantities , such as color and bulge dominance .",
    "these correlations allow us to use morphology as a selection criterion for further studies of specific populations ( e.g. , mergers ) .",
    "however , understanding galaxy evolution requires the addition of more physical information , such as rotation curves and full spectral analysis . in this paper",
    "we propose a framework into which such information could be incorporated once it becomes available .",
    "our hope is that this modest first step will eventually lead to the emergence of an overall scheme incorporating most aspects of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we would like to thank ofer lahav , jens hjorth , bob abraham and richard ellis for raising important points regarding soms and morphology and its implications .",
    "as always , eric ostrander s contribution to the mds pipeline was invaluable .",
    "we also thank the referee for a thorough report .",
