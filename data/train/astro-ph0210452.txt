    "in the last decades it has been recognized that the very high rayleigh number convective boundary layer ( cbl ) has more complex nature than might be reckoned . besides the fully organized component naturally considered as the mean flow and the chaotic small - scale turbulent fluctuations , one more type of motion has been discovered , namely , long - lived large - scale structures , which are neither turbulent nor deterministic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these semi - organized structures considerably enhance the vertical transports and render them essentially non - local in nature . in the atmospheric shear - free convection , the structures represent three - dimensional benard - type cells composed of narrow uprising plumes and wide downdraughts .",
    "they embrace the entire convective boundary layer ( @xmath0 km in height ) and include pronounced large - scale ( @xmath1 km in diameter ) convergence flow patterns close to the surface ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . in sheared convection ,",
    "the structures represent cbl - scale rolls stretched along the mean wind .",
    "life - times of the semi - organized structures are much larger than the turbulent time scales .",
    "thus , these structures can be treated as comparatively stable , quasi - stationary motions , playing the same role with respect to small - scale turbulence as the mean flow .    in a laboratory turbulent convection",
    "several organized features of motion , such as plumes , jets , and the large - scale circulation , are known to exist . the experimentally observed large - scale circulation in the closed box with a heated bottom wall ( the rayleigh - benard apparatus ) is often called the `` mean wind '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "there are several unsolved theoretical questions concerning these flows , e.g. , how do they arise , and what are their characteristics and dynamics .    in spite of a number of studies ,",
    "the nature of large - scale semi - organized structures is poorly understood .",
    "the rayleigh numbers , @xmath2 based on the molecular transport coefficients are very large ( of the order of @xmath3 this corresponds to fully developed turbulent convection in atmospheric and laboratory flows . at the same time the effective rayleigh numbers , @xmath4 based on the turbulent transport coefficients ( the turbulent viscosity and turbulent diffusivity ) are not high , e.g. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the reynolds and peclet numbers , respectively .",
    "they are less than the critical rayleigh numbers required for the excitation of large - scale convection .",
    "hence the emergence of large - scale convective flows ( which are observed in the atmospheric and laboratory flows ) seems puzzling .",
    "the main goal of this study is to suggest a mechanism for excitation of large - scale circulations ( large - scale convection ) . in particular , in the present paper we develop a new mean - field theory of turbulent convection by considering only the small - scale part of spectra as `` turbulence '' and the large - scale part , as a `` mean flow '' , which includes both , regular and semi - organized motions .",
    "we found a convective wind instability in a shear - free turbulent convection which results in formation of large - scale semi - organized fluid motions in the form of cells or rolls ( convective wind ) .",
    "we determined the spatial characteristics of these motions , such as the minimum size of the growing perturbations and the size of perturbations with the maximum growth rate .",
    "in addition , we studied a convective shear instability in a sheared turbulent convection which causes a generation of convective shear waves .",
    "we analyzed the relevance of the obtained results to the turbulent convection in the atmosphere and the laboratory experiments .",
    "traditional theoretical models of the boundary - layer turbulence , such as the kolmogorov - type closures and similarity theories ( e.g. , the monin - obukhov surface - layer similarity theory ) imply two assumptions : ( i ) turbulent flows can be decomposed into two components of principally different nature : fully organized ( mean - flow ) and fully turbulent flows .",
    "( ii ) turbulent fluxes are uniquely determined by the local mean gradients .",
    "for example , the turbulent flux of entropy is given by @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath9 is the turbulent thermal conductivity , @xmath10 is the mean entropy , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fluctuations of the velocity and entropy .",
    "however , the mean velocity gradients can affect the turbulent flux of entropy .",
    "the reason is that additional essentially non - isotropic velocity fluctuations can be generated by tangling of the mean - velocity gradients with the kolmogorov - type turbulence .",
    "the source of energy of this `` tangling turbulence '' is the energy of the kolmogorov turbulence .    in the present paper we showed that the tangling turbulence can cause formation of semi - organized structures due to excitation of large - scale instability .",
    "the tangling turbulence was introduced by wheelon @xcite and batchelor et al .",
    "@xcite for a passive scalar and by golitsyn @xcite and moffatt @xcite for a passive vector ( magnetic field ) .",
    "anisotropic fluctuations of a passive scalar ( e.g. , the number density of particles or temperature ) are generated by tangling of gradients of the mean passive scalar field with random velocity field .",
    "similarly , anisotropic magnetic fluctuations are excited by tangling of the mean magnetic field with the velocity fluctuations .",
    "the reynolds stresses in a turbulent flow with a mean velocity shear is another example of a tangling turbulence .",
    "indeed , they are strongly anisotropic in the presence of shear and have a steeper spectrum @xmath13 than a kolmogorov turbulence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the anisotropic velocity fluctuations of tangling turbulence were studied first by lumley @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we described the governing equations and the method of the derivations of the turbulent flux of entropy and reynolds stresses . in section iii using the derived mean field equations we studied the large - scale instability in a shear - free turbulent convection which causes formation of semi - organized fluid motions in the form of cells .",
    "in section iv the instability in a sheared turbulent convection is investigated and formation of large - scale semi - organized rolls is described .",
    "application of the obtained results for the analysis of observed semi - organized structures in the atmospheric turbulent convection is discussed in section v.",
    "our goal is to study the tangling turbulence , in particular , an effect of sheared large - scale motions on a developed turbulent stratified convection . to this end",
    "we consider a fully developed turbulent convection in a stratified non - rotating fluid with large rayleigh and reynolds numbers .",

    "<S> a new mean - field theory of turbulent convection is developed by considering only the small - scale part of spectra as `` turbulence '' and the large - scale part , as a `` mean flow '' , which includes both regular and semi - organized motions . </S>",
    "<S> the developed theory predicts the convective wind instability in a shear - free turbulent convection . </S>",
    "<S> this instability causes formation of large - scale semi - organized fluid motions in the form of cells or rolls . </S>",
    "<S> spatial characteristics of these motions , such as the minimum size of the growing perturbations and the size of perturbations with the maximum growth rate , are determined . </S>",
    "<S> this study predicts also the existence of the convective shear instability in a sheared turbulent convection . </S>",
    "<S> this instability causes generation of convective shear waves which have a nonzero hydrodynamic helicity . </S>",
    "<S> increase of shear promotes excitation of the convective shear instability . </S>",
    "<S> applications of the obtained results to the atmospheric turbulent convection and the laboratory experiments on turbulent convection are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> this theory can be applied also for the describing a mesogranular turbulent convection in astrophysics . </S>"
