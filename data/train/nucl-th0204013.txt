    "the observation of electron - positron pairs in high - z heavy ion collision experiments at lower energies has been paid close attention @xcite . from the monte carlo simulations of the lepton",
    "kinetic - energy and time - of - flight distributions , it seems that there exists a prompt two - body decay of a light neutral particle of mass @xmath6 at rest in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "although it was claimed that the sharp sum - energy lines in electron - positron pairs emission from heavy - ion collisions was not repeated by the atlas positron experiment@xmath7 in 1995 @xcite , the apex results have been suspected @xcite . in this paper , by studying the properties of the electromagnetic field in the nuclear matter and finite nuclei , we would show that the predicted light neutral particle of mass @xmath6 is just a massive photon . in nuclear matter",
    ", we suggested that the photon gains mass through the interaction with nucleons , and the same mechanism may also be applied to the electromagnetic field in finite nuclei .",
    "in nuclear physics , we always define the ground state of nuclear matter as `` vacuum '' , where the fermi sea is filled by nucleons , and no anti - nucleons and holes exist . because the proton has one unit of positive charge , and the expectation value of electric density operator in the nuclear matter is not zero , namely @xmath8 .",
    "this `` vacuum '' is different from the real vacuum where nothing exists .",
    "if the electromagnetic field and proton field interaction is considered as a perturbation , the perturbative hamiltonian in the interactive representation can be expressed as @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the fields of the proton , and @xmath11 being the electromagnetic field .",
    "the s - matrix can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13.\\ ] ] to study the proton - proton interaction via the photon exchange , @xmath14.\\ ] ] should be calculated .",
    "the proton field operator @xmath15 and its conjugate operator @xmath16 can be expanded in terms of a complete set of solutions to the dirac equation : @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes the spin of the proton , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation and creation operators of the nucleon respectively . in these two expressions",
    ", we have assumed that there are no antinucleons in the nuclear matter or finite nuclei , thus only positive - energy components exist .",
    "the photon field operator @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the momentum of the photon .",
    "since a perturbative single nucleon loop would contribute to the self energy of the photon a term of @xmath26 , which can be eliminated by the renormalization procedure@xcite , the diagrams in fig.1 should be calculated .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the step function .",
    "as the situation in fig.1 is considered , we obtains the photon propagator @xmath32 in nuclear matter as @xmath33 according to the dyson equation @xmath34 we obtain @xmath35    under the on shell condition of protons @xmath36 the self - energy of the real , on - shell photon can be easily derived as @xmath37 in this expression , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the fine structure constant , @xmath40 is the mass of proton , and @xmath41 denotes the scalar density of protons @xmath42 thus , the photon gains the effective mass @xmath43 in nuclear matter .",
    "it should be mentioned that the effective mass of photon is only related to the scalar density of protons in the nuclear matter , but not the momentum of the photon . in a symmetric nuclear matter , where the densities of proton and neutron are the same , if the nucleon density is @xmath44 , the effective mass of photon is about @xmath1 .    in a finite nucleus , a two - parameter fermi model of nuclear charge - density - distribution",
    "can be written as@xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath4 , and @xmath48 is determined by the equation @xmath49 by assuming that in a finite nucleus , the proton number density is equal to the nuclear charge - density , the proton densities and corresponding effective photon masses at different radii around the surface region of @xmath4 can be calculated and the corresponding results are listed in table 1 .",
    "it seems that at the surface of @xmath4 , the photon has effective mass of about @xmath3 , which is consistent with the predicted neutral particle mass in the low energy @xmath5 heavy - ion collisions near coulomb barrier @xcite , so the massive photon at the surface of @xmath4 or @xmath50 might decay into an electron - positron pair in the disturbances of the nuclear coulomb field .",
    "it might be the reason of the discovery of sharp line 800kev @xmath51 pairs in the @xmath5 heavy - ion collisions .    the electromagnetic interaction between protons is realized by exchanging virtual photons in nuclear matter . in the relativistic hartree approximation shown in fig .",
    "2 , the momentum of virtual proton @xmath52 consequently @xmath53 . then the argument for the real photon mentioned above is suitable for the virtual photon exchanged between protons in nuclear matter .",
    "the contribution of the photon mass term should be included in the calculation of relativistic hartree approximation or relativistic mean - field approximation in the finite nuclei .",
    "again in the nuclear matter , because @xmath54 , the @xmath0 local gauge symmetry of electric charge is spontaneously broken , and the higgs field should be included .    the lagrangian density of higgs field @xmath55 is@xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xmath58    the lagrangian is invariant under the local gauge transformation @xmath59",
    "@xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an arbitrary real function .",
    "the local gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken when @xmath63 .    obviously , the lowest - energy solution is @xmath64 @xmath65 to study the classical modes near such a solution , the most convenient way is staying in the `` unitary gauge '' , in which @xmath66 is real under a continuous local gauge transformation .",
    "thus we can always write @xmath67 then the equations of motion become @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 since @xmath72 , we must have @xmath73 wherever @xmath74 . taking @xmath75 and treating @xmath76 and @xmath77 as small quantities",
    ", one can deduce eqs .",
    "( [ eq : em ] ) and  ( [ eq : hig ] ) into linearized forms @xmath78 and @xmath79    these equations show that the fields @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath55 and @xmath82 in a fixed gauge are now replaced by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the spin-1 particle has a mass of @xmath85 , and the spin-0 particle has a mass of @xmath86 , in other word , the photon obtains mass in the nuclear matter .    from above discussion , we find that in the nuclear matter , the effective mass of photon can either be obtained by the higgs mechanism or the perturbutive calculation .",
    "this result also implies that the higgs mechanism is not a unique method to solve problems when the local gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "in summary , the electromagnetic field in nuclear matter is studied .",
    "because in the nuclear matter the expectation value of the electric charge density operator is not zero , the @xmath0 local gauge symmetry of electric charge is spontaneously broken , consequently the photon gains a effective mass .",
    "alternatively , this mass can also be obtained from the perturbative calculation of the photon self - energy in the nuclear matter .",
    "it is shown that the effective mass is related to the scalar density of protons .",
    "the effective mass of photon is about @xmath1 in the symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density of @xmath2 , and about @xmath3 in the surface of @xmath4 .",
    "it just fits the mass of the neutral particle suggested in the high - z heavy ion collision experiments at low energies near comloub barrier , in which the sharp lines of electron - positron pair was observed .",
    "obviously , the two - body decay of such a massive photon would produce a pair of electron and positron .",
    "the property of electromagnetic field in the nuclear matter or finite nuclei is different from that in the vacuum .",
    "because the photon in the nuclear matter has an effective mass , this fact should also carefully be considered in the investigation of the nuclear many - body problems . in the future work",
    ", we will continue to study the relevant effects on this aspect .",
