    "recently coherent and incoherent photoproduction of @xmath0 in ultraperipheral collisions ( upcs ) of nuclei was measured by the alice collaboration at the lhc  @xcite . in the coherent channel , a large reduction of the coherent cross section ",
    "approximately by a factor of three  as compared to the impulse approximation has been reported .",
    "such a magnitude of the suppression was found to be in the reasonable agreement with the expectations of the approaches predicting significant nuclear gluon shadowing at @xmath5 ( @xmath1 is the fraction of the nucleus momentum carried by gluons ) , notably with predictions of the leading twist approach to nuclear shadowing  @xcite and with the results of the eps09 global qcd fit to nuclear parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "thus , charmonium photoproduction on nuclear targets is a useful tool to study nuclear gluon shadowing at small @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we extend application of the leading twist approach to nuclear shadowing  @xcite to incoherent quasielastic photoproduction of @xmath0 on nuclei and show that the suppression of both coherent and incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction in ion  ion upcs can be described in the same framework .",
    "a comparison of the resulting theoretical prediction for the cross section of incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction in pb - pb upcs at the lhc to the alice data , which is also characterized to correspond to an incoherent quasielastic process  @xcite , shows that the expected suppression due to nuclear shadowing is larger than that seen in the data .",
    "we argue that this does not only place additional constraints on models of nuclear shadowing down to @xmath6 but also indicates that additional processes can contribute to the alice data .",
    "in particular , on top of incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei resulting from the target nucleus excitation , the @xmath7 process driven by the @xmath8 nucleon dissociation ( @xmath9 denotes products of the nucleon dissociation ) accompanied by the nucleus breakup into the @xmath10 system consisting of nucleus debris or nucleons also leads to the inelastic final state .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath7 contribution is rather involved reflecting different mechanisms of the elementary reaction at small and large @xmath11 considered in  @xcite and will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "second , we discuss specifics of and make predictions for coherent and incoherent charmonium production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus upcs accompanied by forward neutron emission which can be studied at the lhc with the alice , cms and atlas detectors equipped by zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) .",
    "the following channels can be studied : ( i ) one of the nuclei emits at least one neutron while its partner does not  ( 0nxn ) ; ( ii ) both nuclei emit neutrons in opposite directions  ( xnxn ) , ( iii ) neither of the nuclei emits neutrons  ( 0n0n ) .",
    "we show that selection of a specific channel can strongly influence the ratio of the cross sections of incoherent to coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in pb - pb upcs at the lhc . in particular ,",
    "we argue that the study of incoherent production of charmonium in ion  ion upcs with the nucleus breakup allows one to separate the low - photon - energy and high - photon - energy contributions to nuclear @xmath0 photoproduction and , hence , to provide additional information on the dynamics of nuclear shadowing of the gluon distribution in nuclei which is complementary to that obtained from coherent onium production .",

    "it would be desirable to perform an additional analysis of the alice data  @xcite by assuming that the @xmath191 and @xmath182 contributions to incoherent nuclear @xmath0 photoproduction have different slopes of the @xmath18 dependence , which would enable one to experimentally estimate the contribution of the nucleon dissociation and , thus , will enable a direct comparison of the data with predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_incoh_2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is likely that due to the interaction of the system @xmath9 with the nucleus , nucleon dissociation will lead to a larger number of neutrons originating from the nucleus dissociation .",
    "finally , the study of neutron production in the quasielastic @xmath192 process at @xmath193 gev@xmath54 , where the @xmath182 contribution dominates , may be interesting for understanding of the formation time in diffraction .      besides alice ,",
    "the atlas and cms detectors at the lhc are capable to measure upc production of @xmath0 in the @xmath194 range of rapidity . while for central rapidities , the interpretation of the corresponding measurements is unambiguous , it is difficult to disentangle the high - photon - energy and low - photon - energy contributions to @xmath4 for non - central values of @xmath183 and , thus , to access the small-@xmath1 region that we are interested in . in particular , according to the estimates of  @xcite , for @xmath195 in pb - pb upcs at 2.76 tev , the @xmath4 rapidity distribution in the coherent case is exceedingly dominated ( by the factor of four ) by the low - photon - energy contribution corresponding to @xmath196 of the probed nuclear gluons .",
    "the high - photon - energy contribution is suppressed by the much lower photon flux and the larger nuclear gluon shadowing .",
    "hence , it is rather difficult to extract the high energy nuclear coherent @xmath0 photoproduction cross section from the upc data and , hence , to probe the nuclear gluon distribution around @xmath197 .",
    "the method to overcome this difficulty was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the observation of  @xcite that coherent photoproduction of vector mesons in heavy ion upcs can be accompanied by additional photon exchanges which lead to electromagnetic excitation of one or both nuclei with the subsequent neutron emission .",
    "these neutrons will have the energy close to that of the colliding beams and can be detected by zero degree calorimeters placed at large distances on both sides of the detectors . with the additional requirement to have in the final state only two muons from the @xmath0 decay ( in addition to the neutrons ) and the large rapidity gap , i.e. , by requiring the absence of any other charged particle in the whole range of @xmath183 covered by the detector system , the strong interaction of the colliding nuclei should be suppressed .    to calculate the cross section of photoproduction of vector mesons in upcs accompanied by the additional electromagnetic excitation of the colliding nuclei followed by their subsequent neutron emission , we use the model developed in  @xcite .",
    "this approach is justified by the success of the calculations of  @xcite describing very well the alice data on electromagnetic dissociation in pb - pb upcs  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that an additional photon exchange does not destroy coherence of the photoproduction process but influences the impact parameter of the ultraperipheral collision .",
    "the latter is taken into account by the modification of the flux of the photons participating in photoproduction : @xmath198 where the impact parameter dependent factor of @xmath199 takes into account different channels of the nuclear decay by the neutron emission ( @xmath200  0n0n , 0nxn , xnxn , @xmath201 ) .",
    "in particular , the 0n0n - channel corresponds to the selection of events without additional electromagnetic dissociation with the nucleus neutron decay ; the 0nxn - channel corresponds to one - side excitation with the nucleus neutron decay of only one of the colliding nuclei ; the xnxn - channel corresponds to mutual electromagnetic dissociation with both excited nuclei decaying by neutron emission . to obtain a rough estimate of the size of the effect",
    ", each additional photon exchange in pb - pb upcs leads to the suppression of the cross section by the factor of @xmath202 .    based on the assumption that an additional photon exchange influences only the flux of photons ,",
    "( [ flux ] ) , one can try to separate the low - energy ( @xmath203 ) and high - energy ( @xmath204 ) @xmath0 photoproduction contributions in the rapidity spectra measured in heavy ion upcs . to this end",
    ", it is necessary @xcite to measure rapidity distributions of vector meson production in any two channels , e.g. , 0nxn and xnxn , and using the calculated photon fluxes for these channels , to solve simple equations at a fixed value of the rapidity @xmath183 . for the coherent case ,",
    "one then obtains : @xmath205 since the photon fluxes @xmath206 and @xmath207 can be calculated with good accuracy , measurements of different channels will allow one to study nuclear gluon shadowing in a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "according to our calculations presented and discussed below , the relative contributions of low - photon - energy and high - photon - energy @xmath0 photoproduction in these channels are strongly different : while in the 0nxn - channel they are almost equal , the high - energy photoproduction dominates in the xnxn - channel .",
    "production of forward neutrons in quasielastic incoherent photoproduction of @xmath0 in heavy ion upcs with the nuclear breakup has been considered in  @xcite . since in this case the momentum transfer in elastic @xmath0 photoproduction on the nucleon can be as large as @xmath208 gev@xmath54 , this target nucleon escaping from the nucleus participates in additional quasielastic rescattering .",
    "the average excitation energy of a heavy nucleus in the one - nucleon removal process is about @xmath209 mev , which is much higher than the separation energy of @xmath210 mev of one neutron .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that in incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction in heavy ion upcs , the residual nucleus will decay emitting one or more neutrons with the probability of about @xmath211 . therefore , imposing the constraint that no neutrons are emitted , i.e. , considering the 0n0n - channel , one can almost completely ( at the level of @xmath212% ) suppress the incoherent contribution .    as we mentioned in the end of sect .",
    "[ subsec : upc_coherent ]    , the contribution of nucleon dissociation becomes important / dominant with an increase of the transverse momentum of @xmath0 .",
    "this process should lead to at least as many neutrons as the quasielastic process .",
    "therefore , the @xmath191 and @xmath182 contributions should be either separated experimentally or the latter should be included in the theoretical calculation of the @xmath192 cross section .",
    "the procedure for the extraction of the high - photon - energy contribution that we discuss below involves the use of the different @xmath213 dependences of the @xmath191 and @xmath182 cross sections , which allows one to separate their contributions .",
    "we also note in passing that the study of the neutron multiplicity at @xmath214 gev , where the process of nucleon dissociation dominates , would produce for the first time information about the space  time formation of hadrons in the diffractive processes like @xmath182 .    the recent phenix data on @xmath0 photoproduction in ultraperipheral au - au collisions at 200 gev accompanied by neutrons detected in both zdcs  @xcite gives an opportunity to check main assumptions about the sources of forward neutrons in coherent and incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction in heavy ion upcs at high energies .",
    "indeed , since the nuclear gluon shadowing in these processes is small at rhic energies ( the shadowing effect leads to an approximately 20% reduction at the cross section level ) , the coherent and incoherent photoproduction cross sections can be calculated using either the dipole model or the leading twist approximation ; at @xmath130 corresponding to the rhic kinematics , the dipole model and lta predictions largely converge . in this work , we use a simple version of the dipole model which employs the standard glauber expressions [ eqs .",

    "it is worth noting here that for the discussed kinematics , the results for the dipole ",
    "nucleon cross section obtained in different dipole models are rather close since they are well constrained by the dis data for these energies  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is much smaller than the phenix experimental errors and , hence , it is not shown in fig .",
    "[ phenix ] . note also that in the discussed model , the nuclear shadowing effect is driven by the @xmath216 dipole cross section and , hence , shadowing is suppressed ( it is a higher twist effect ) for the dipoles of such a small size , see the discussion above .",
    "selection of events with two - side neutron detection means that in the xnxn - channel , coherent production should take into account the mutual electromagnetic dissociation that requires at least two additional photon exchanges .",
    "in contrast , according to the predictions of  @xcite , incoherent production is associated with excitation and neutron decay of only the target nucleus .",
    "hence , in this case , detection of the xnxn - channel requires only one photon exchange to excite the nucleus , which serves as a source of the photon flux in the process of incoherent production .",
    "figure  [ phenix ] presents a comparison of the phenix results for the xnxn - channel with our theoretical calculations using the simple dipole described above . despite large experimental errors",

    "first , one can see from the two left panels that using the data on the 0nxn and xnxn - channels , one can try to extract the high - photon - energy contribution using eq .",
    "( [ eq : disentangling ] ) . in the range of rapidities of @xmath218 , this will allow one to determine nuclear gluon shadowing in pb down to @xmath197 and at the scale of @xmath219 gev@xmath54 from coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in upcs .",
    "second , a comparison of the corresponding upper shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ cms ] shows that we predict that at central rapidities , ( i ) in the 0nxn - channel , the coherent and incoherent contributions will be practically of the same magnitude and ( ii ) in the xnxn - channel , the coherent contribution exceeds the incoherent one by approximately a factor of two .",
    "third , besides the coherent channel , the incoherent cross section can also be used to study nuclear gluon shadowing at small @xmath1 .",
    "based on the dominance of the strong interaction mechanism of neutron production in incoherent photoproduction , we predict that there is a good opportunity to separate the low - photon - energy and high - photon - energy contributions in the 0nxn - channel ( see the upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ cms ] ) .",
    "indeed , since in this case neutrons are emitted by the target nucleus , there should by a correlation between the direction of the produced @xmath0 and the direction of neutrons in upc events . in the kinematics of upcs ,",
    "the direction of charmonium produced by a high - energy photon and , hence , low-@xmath1 gluons from the target , is opposite to the direction of the target nucleus and , correspondingly , to the direction of neutrons .",
    "conversely , in the low - photon - energy production , the direction of charmonium coincides with the direction of the target and neutrons .",
    "the standard procedure of the separation of coherent and incoherent events consists in the analysis of momentum transfer distributions . in coherent photoproduction ,",
    "this distribution is dictated by the nuclear form factor squared and presents several distinct peaks at small @xmath220 mev / c , where @xmath213 is the transverse momentum of produced @xmath0 and @xmath221 .",
    "one can see such first three diffractive peaks in fig .",
    "[ ptdist ] .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the incoherent nuclear cross section is the same as in the elementary process , i.e. , @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "our predictions for the sum of the coherent and incoherent cross sections of @xmath0 photoproduction in pb - pb upcs accompanied by neutron emission in the 0nxn - channel as a function of @xmath213 in the rapidity range of @xmath218 is shown in the upper panel of fig .",

    "therefore , the @xmath220 mev / c cut will effectively reject incoherent events with good accuracy .",
    "as we already discussed above , the incoherent cross section can also probe the small-@xmath1 nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "in particular , in the 0nxn - channel , the directions of @xmath0 and the emitted neutrons can be unambiguously correlated with either the low - photon - energy or with the high - photon - energy contributions . at the same time , in the coherent channel , due to the assumption of independence of the processes of coherent photoproduction and electromagnetic dissociation followed by the nucleus neutron decay , it is impossible to assign emitting neutrons to the source or the target , and , hence , the probabilities to detect neutrons in the same and in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of @xmath0 should be equal .",
    "these predictions are demonstrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ ptdist ] , where the upper band corresponds to the situation when the direction of @xmath0 coincides with that of the neutrons and the lower band is for the opposite directions of @xmath0 and the neutrons .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratio of the two curves from the middle panel .",
    "since we identify the events , where the directions of @xmath0 and neutrons are opposite , with high - energy photoproduction , there could be two sources of suppression of the corresponding cross section : ( i ) the falloff of the flux of high - energy photons emitted by the nucleus and ( ii ) stronger nuclear gluon shadowing of the small-@xmath1 gluons at @xmath6 , which we are mainly interested in .",
    "we considered @xmath0 photoproduction in ion ",

    "we extended the formalism of leading twist nuclear shadowing characterized by large nuclear gluon shadowing to the incoherent @xmath13 cross section .",
    "we found that despite a good agreement between the approaches predicting large nuclear gluon shadowing at @xmath5 and the large nuclear suppression factor extracted from the alice data on coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in pb - pb upcs at the lhc  @xcite , in the incoherent channel , the leading twist approximation predicts the amount of nuclear suppression due to gluon shadowing which exceeds that seen in the data by approximately a factor of @xmath3 ( fig .",

    "ion upcs , it is problematic ( except for @xmath147 and large @xmath179 ) to separate the contributions of high - energy and low - energy photons to the @xmath4 cross section , which reduces the range of @xmath1 for the studies of small-@xmath1 nuclear gluon shadowing .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by considering @xmath0 photoproduction in ion ",
    "ion upcs accompanied by neutron emission due to electromagnetic excitation of one or both colliding nuclei .    using the leading twist approximation for nuclear gluon",

    "<S> we find that despite the good agreement between large nuclear gluon shadowing and the alice data in the coherent channel , in the incoherent channel , the leading twist approximation predicts the amount of nuclear suppression which is by approximately a factor of @xmath3 exceeds that seen in the data . </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize that part of the discrepancy can be accounted for by the incoherent inelastic process of @xmath0 photoproduction with nucleon dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> to separate the high - photon - energy and low - photon - energy contributions to the @xmath4 cross section , we consider ion  ion upcs accompanied by neutron emission due to electromagnetic excitation of one or both colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the corresponding phenix data and make predictions for the lhc kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in the incoherent quasielastic case , we show that the separation between the low - photon - energy and high - photon - energy contributions can be efficiently performed by measuring the correlation between the directions of @xmath0 and the emitted neutrons . </S>"
