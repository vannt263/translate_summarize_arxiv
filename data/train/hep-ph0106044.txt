    "models with extra dimensions provide several interesting mechanisms for supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "these mechanisms seem to make essential use of the presence of extra dimensions , which are not obviously realizable in a simple four dimensional setup .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed , cohen and georgi  @xcite and also hill , pokorski and wang  @xcite argued that it might be possible to translate many higher dimensional effects into a purely 4d construction by using a set of 4d theories which in the ir reproduce a the dynamics of the extra dimensional theory",
    ". these theories are also useful tools to regulate the higher dimensional theories , and even give a uv completion of them @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a fully 4d implementation of a higher dimensional mechanism for supersymmetry breaking ( gaugino mediation ) , using a 4d @xmath8 susy model which at low energies is equivalent to a latticized version of these higher dimensional models . in order to do",
    "so we first show how to construct the higher dimensional supersymmetric theories from a 4d `` moose '' ( lattice ) approach .",
    "because the minimal spinor representation of the 5d lorentz group is twice as large as that of the 4d lorentz group , one might think that a fine - tuning in the fermion sector is needed in order to construct a lorentz invariant higher dimensional theory which includes fermions .",
    "in addition , 5d susy would then require at least 8 supercharges , which corresponds to @xmath9 supersymmetry in 4d .",
    "we will demonstrate that 4d @xmath8 supersymmetry plus gauge invariance ( with properly chosen matter content ) is enough to ensure the existence of the additional supersymmetries in the continuum limit .",
    "this phenomenon of enhanced supersymmetry generation is related to the behavior of these models at low energies in a purely 4d context , in which @xmath10=1 susy is enhanced to @xmath10=2 on the moduli space , without the fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "however , in the presence of additional hypermultiplets the required superpotential does have to be tuned in the 4d theories .",
    "the analogous effect that we obtain here is that maintaining 5d lorentz invariance will require the tuning of a superpotential coupling in the 4d lattice models .",
    "we present the explicit construction of these models which will give in the continuum limit the 5d @xmath8 theory , show how to achieve the required gauge symmetry breaking dynamically , and how to add flavors .",
    "we carefully check that the mass spectrum for gauge fields , scalars and fermions indeed matches the tower of kk modes for a 5d @xmath8 supersymmetric gauge theory , and that 5d lorentz invariance and supersymmetry is indeed recovered in the continuum limit .",
    "this is not a trivial fact , because in the usual wilson lattice action the fermions are included as adjoints living at the sites of the lattice , while for our construction they are in bifundamentals at the links .    in order to translate gaugino mediation of supersymmetry breaking into a 4d language",
    "we show how the corresponding @xmath11 orbifolds are constructed .",
    "armed with this knowledge , we present a simple 4d version of gaugino mediation , where the lattice can be as coarse as two gauge groups and still give the characteristic gaugino - mediated spectrum .",
    "one of these gauge groups contains the standard model matter fields , while another couples to the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "the physical gaugino is a linear combination of the gauginos for the various group factors and thus obtains a mass directly from the supersymmetry breaking sector , while the scalar mass terms for the mssm matter fields will be suppressed by an additional loop factor , just like in ordinary gaugino mediation .",
    "an important difference between the 4d and 5d approach is that in the 4d approach planck suppressed contact terms must be subleading , because ( contrary to the 5d case ) they have no further exponential suppression .",
    "the reason for this is that the notion of locality from gravity s point of view is lost , if ( as we will imagine ) 4d gravity is minimally included into the theory .",
    "thus from this point of view the spirit of these models more closely resembles that of gauge mediation , where the planck suppressed operators should also be negligible .",
    "however , the resulting mass spectrum agrees with that of gaugino mediation , and differs from the generic gauge - mediated spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give the construction of the supersymmetric lattice models and check that the perturbative mass spectrum agrees with that of the @xmath8 5d theory . in section 3",
    "we show how to include flavors into the construction , and present the orbifold models . using these results we present the 4d models for gaugino mediation in section 4 , and conclude in section 5 .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the low energy behavior of a purely 4d theory can be effectively described by the low - lying kk modes of a 5d theory compactified on a circle or an @xmath11 orbifold . here",
    "we will first present the supersymmetric versions of these theories , so that later we can use these to construct the 4d analogs of a higher dimensional mechanism for mediating supersymmetry breaking .",

    "without further modification of the model , at a generic point in moduli space the theory will have @xmath28 unbroken @xmath29 gauge groups and no charged fields under those @xmath29 s .",

    "we will demonstrate that the field theory described above is equivalent to a latticized version of a 5d @xmath10=1 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "this 5d @xmath8 supersymmetric gauge theory has twice the number of supercharges as the @xmath8 theory in 4d .",
    "this is an interesting phenomenon in its own right , as supersymmetries are dynamically generated at low energy .",
    "although we do not study the case here , a similar phenomenon is expected to occur in one dimension lower , _",
    "i.e. _ , generation of a 4d susy gauge theory from a 3d theory with fewer supersymmetry charges .",
    "the massless matter content of the @xmath17 gauge theory corresponding to the theory ( [ fieldcontent ] ) at low energies is that of an @xmath9 4d theory , namely in addition to the massless @xmath10=1 vector multiplet there is also a chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation .",

    "there will still be a branch on the moduli space of vacua that achieves the dynamical breaking of the gauge symmetry to the diagonal one .",
    "however , in order to ensure that we are on the right branch ( and that the other moduli are massive ) a non - renormalizable tree - level superpotential will have to be added , at least for the example based on the simplest possible matter content .",

    "this decomposition agrees exactly with the spectrum we have found .",
    "moreover each mass level transforms in the adjoint of the unbroken diagonal @xmath17 gauge group .      up to now",
    "we have shown that the mass spectrum of the theory indeed matches that of the higher dimensional supersymmetric theory . as we have mentioned above",
    ", the question of the existence of the full 5d lorentz invariance is tightly related to the question of whether the full 5d @xmath8 supersymmetry is present or not .",
    "the reason is that the global `` hopping '' symmetry of the 4d theory , which is closely related to the enhanced susy at low energies , becomes a spacetime symmetry of the 5d theory .",
    "the lorentz symmetry generators are part of the full susy algebra .",
    "hence , 5d supersymmetry requires an enhanced lorentz symmetry .",
    "this manifests itself in a doubling in the number of supersymmetry generators , which then form an irreducible representation of the 5d lorentz group .",
    "if supersymmetry is indeed enhanced , then the theory must automatically be 5d lorentz invariant for consistency ( meaning that the speed of light should not differ in the fifth direction ) .",
    "the converse is also true : if one can show that 5d lorentz invariance is maintained , then the existence of the four supercharges implies that there must be another set of four supercharges present in the theory .",
    "we will pursue this latter route .",
    "we will calculate the kinetic term along the fifth dimension for the fermionic fields , and show that 5d lorentz invariance is automatically obtained ; that is , the speed of light along the fifth direction automatically matches the speed along the non - latticized four dimensions , just as has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "then by 4d supersymmetry one also obtains a similar conclusion for the scalars , from which it follows that the full 5d supersymmetry must be present .    in order to show this we have to show that the action at leading order is given by terms that are the discretized versions of the 5d @xmath8 susy yang - mills theory",
    "however , that theory has only adjoint fermions living at lattice sites , as opposed to our bifundamental fermions .",
    "so it is not _ a priori _ obvious that one indeed gets the required action . in order to show this we first identify the scalar component of the bifundamental fields with the link variable @xmath157 _ via _",
    "@xmath158 , where the @xmath157 s are unitary matrices transforming as bifundamentals under that @xmath137 ( as is appropriate for link variables ) .",
    "now we define fermions transforming as adjoints only under single gauge groups ( thus living at the sites of the lattice in the 5d language ) by defining @xmath159 . with this identification of the fermion fields living on the sites",
    "we can write the interaction part of the action in ( [ fermioninteract ] ) as @xmath160 in 5d the dirac fermion is irreducible , so one expects @xmath139 and @xmath161 to form a dirac fermion , and the above term to correspond to the discretized version of the kinetic term of the 5d action along the fifth dimension .",
    "this is indeed the case , since one can define the 5d dirac spinor by @xmath162 and then the discretized version of @xmath163 is indeed reproduced by ( [ fermionkinetic ] ) , where the lattice spacing is identified with @xmath101 , and the relevant gamma matrices in weyl representation are compared to the usual @xmath164 defined in 4d . ]",
    "@xmath165    this shows that 5d lorentz invariance is automatic in these models , and in turn that the full 5d supersymmetry must be present in the continuum limit .",
    "thus we have shown that the kinetic terms of the fermions automatically have the same speed of light along the 5@xmath166 dimension as for the other four . by 4d @xmath8",
    "susy the scalar kinetic terms also have the right continuum limit , and it has already been shown in @xcite that the same applies to the gauge bosons .",
    "in fact , as explained before , since the 5d theory must have at least eight supercharges , there are only two possibilities : either one obtains the 5d @xmath8 theory and then lorentz invariance is automatically implied , or the theory is not lorentz invariant .",
    "the reason for this is that the 4d construction already guarantees the presence of four supercharges .",
    "thus in a lorentz invariant theory the other four must also be present .      until now we have concentrated on the region where @xmath167 , when non - perturbative effects are not important , because the gauge group is broken before it could become strongly interacting .",
    "another important check would be to match the non - perturbative effects for the case when @xmath168 . in this case",
    "non - perturbative effects will be important , and can be described by an auxiliary seiberg  witten curve .",
    "these curves have in fact been analyzed for the 4d lattice theory in @xcite , and for the 5d @xmath8 theories on a circle in @xcite .",
    "the degrees of both curves match , as do the number of moduli appearing in the theory .",
    "this suggests that there is at least a chance that these two curves could become equivalent in the continuum limit .",
    "it would be very interesting to actually find a detailed mapping of the two curves , which is however beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "adding extra flavors to the theory is straightforward .",
    "however , there is one important difference compared to the case without flavors . until now",
    "one did not need to tune any parameter of the theory to recover the higher dimensional supersymmetric model .",
    "this is not surprising , because a 4d @xmath10=1 susy theory with only a vector and chiral multiplet ( and no superpotential for the chiral multiplet ) already has @xmath10=2 supersymmetry .",
    "however , this is no longer true in the presence of hypermultiplets . in this case",
    "the @xmath8 lagrangian needs to contain a superpotential coupling of the form @xmath169 , where @xmath82 has to be equal to the gauge coupling , @xmath170 form the hypermultiplet , and @xmath171 is the chiral superfield in the adjoint .",
    "thus we expect that a similar tuning has to occur in this case as well .",

    "these fields acquire scalar component vevs that break the sm @xmath156 sm group structure down to just the sm .",
    "the ordinary mssm gauge couplings @xmath349 for @xmath350 are related to the gauge couplings @xmath351 of the endpoint lattice group through @xmath352 , evaluated near the scale @xmath57 .",
    "the gauge couplings therefore appear to undergo a discontinuous jump at this scale , if we follow the gauge couplings of the diagonal subgroup up to @xmath57 and then the gauge couplings of the mssm lattice site for energies beyond @xmath57 .",
    "we can evolve the individual gauge couplings @xmath353 above the scale @xmath57 by the usual renormalization group procedure . of course we must also include the link fields ( and the anomaly cancellation fields ) in the beta functions . at one - loop the running of the gauge couplings from @xmath354 down to @xmath57 is given by the usual formula @xmath355 written entirely in terms of the parameters of the lattice site gauge groups ( barred quantities ) , where @xmath356 are the gauge couplings for the two scales @xmath357 .",
    "let us now decompose this expression in terms of the usual mssm gauge couplings @xmath349 and beta function coefficients @xmath358 .",
    "the diagonal subgroup will feel one kk mode of gauge and gaugino fields , but since these fields have masses of order @xmath359 , we can approximately treat this scenario as going from the 4d mssm lattice site directly to the diagonal subgroup with just the 4d mssm matter content .",
    "that is , @xmath360 .",
    "the beta function coefficient above the scale @xmath57 is @xmath361 with the ratio @xmath362 , we can choose the hypercharge of the link field connecting u(1 ) @xmath156 u(1 ) such that the above shift in the beta function coefficients satisfies the conditions for one - loop unification given by ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath363 hence , unification of gauge couplings can be maintained for the @xmath332 case , although at a slightly lower scale than in the usual 4d mssm .",
    "however , in order to have a fully unified theory one would also have to embed these link fields into the gut group .",
    "we have presented 4d constructions for supersymmetric models with extra dimensions .",
    "we have found that in the simplest model ( 5d @xmath8 susy ym ) the necessary enhancement of 4d @xmath8 supersymmetry automatically takes place without any fine - tuning , and thus 5d lorentz invariance is also recovered . for a theory with more complicated matter content",
    "this result no longer holds , and a fine - tuning in the interaction terms is necessary . we have used these models to translate the _ a priori _ five dimensional mechanism of gaugino mediation of supersymmetry breaking into a simple 4d model . in these 4d versions of gaugino mediation supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the mssm because the physical gaugino is a mixture of gauge eigenstate gauginos , one of which couples to the supersymmetry breaking sector , while another to the sm matter fields .",
    "we find that a lattice as coarse as two gauge groups is sufficient to ensure the appearance of the soft breaking mass spectrum characteristic of gaugino mediation so long as the inverse lattice spacing is much smaller than the susy mediation scale . with more than about five gauge groups one also obtains the gaugino - mediated spectrum even if the susy mediation scale is of order the inverse lattice spacing .",

    "we also thank nima arkani - hamed , sasha gorsky , weonjong lee , martin schmaltz , yuri shirman and raman sundrum for useful discussions , and nima arkani - hamed , andy cohen , stefan pokorski and yuri shirman for valuable comments on the manuscript .",
