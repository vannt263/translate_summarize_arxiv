    "in fact , in this case it is possible to transform the original schrdinger equation into a dirac equation , by means of a suitable mixing ( _ rotation _ ) of the two bands and of a _ coarse graining _ procedure via a projection over a basis of wannier functions @xcite .    a crucial point that guarantees the validity of this reduction is the existence of a set of wannier functions sufficiently localized within each lattice cell , in the _ rotated _ basis @xcite .",
    "in order to clarify this point , in this paper we present a detailed derivation of the dirac effective equation , that allows to highlight the role played by the wannier functions ( that are not uniquely defined , owing to the arbitrariness of the phase of the bloch functions @xcite ) , analyzing the specific cases discussed in refs .",

    "let us start from the single particle schrdinger equation in the presence of a periodic potential @xmath2 ( of period @xmath3 ) and a slowly varying external potential @xmath4 @xmath5 \\psi({x},t ) ,   \\label{eq : schrod}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the unperturbed lattice hamiltonian , whose eigenvectors are bloch functions @xmath7 . then , eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod ] ) can be mapped to quasimomentum space as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 represent the expansion coefficients of a generic wave - packet @xmath10 on the bloch basis , namely @xmath11 , and @xmath12 runs over the first brillouin zone ( the dependence on @xmath13 will be omitted in the following ) .",
    "the above equation can be written in vectorial form as @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "let us now consider a subset of two bands , and assume that around @xmath17 the dispersion relation can be approximated as @xmath18 ( modulo an irrelevant constant ) , as considered in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , in order to put the above expression in the form of a dirac equation , it is convenient to make use of a @xmath19 rotation @xmath20 @xcite , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 we notice that this rotation is related to an inverse foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite ; we shall come back to this point later on .",
    "then , eq . ( [ eq : vec ] ) can be written as @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and @xmath25    equation ( [ eq : rotated ] ) can be transformed back in coordinate space by projection on a basis of wannier functions , as discussed in the following .",
    "we recall that the wannier functions are obtained from the bloch functions as @xcite @xmath26 and that they are not uniquely defined due to the arbitrariness of the bloch functions phase ( that , in general , depends on @xmath27 ) .",
    "a generic wave packet @xmath28 can be expanded as @xmath29 , where the amplitudes @xmath30 can be obtained from the bloch coefficients by a simple fourier transform @xmath31 the same relation holds in the rotated basis @xcite .    when the wannier functions ( in the present case , those in the _ rotated _ basis ) are sufficiently localized in each cell , the rotated amplitudes @xmath32 play the role of envelope functions ( associated to the site @xmath33 , not just to the state @xmath34 ) , corresponding to a _",
    "corse graining _ on the scale of a single cell @xcite . then , following the _ coarse graining _ approximation , the coefficients @xmath35 can be supposed to be differentiable functions of @xmath33 , the latter being considered as a continuous variable ( eventually , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this holds when @xmath35 is slowly varying on the scale of the lattice period ( `` smooth '' wave packet ) . under this approximation , and thanks to the properties of the fourier transform @xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath37 in coordinate space can be obtained by the replacement @xmath38 , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotated ] ) can be mapped in coordinate space as @xmath39 in addition , it is easy to show that @xmath40 yielding @xmath41    when the wannier functions are well localized inside each lattice cell , and the potential @xmath42 is slowly varying on that scale , we can write @xmath43 so that we finally arrive at @xmath44 \\underline{\\chi}'(x).\\ ] ] then , the application of the @xmath45 transformation @xcite @xmath46 yields ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 that corresponds to the dirac equation in @xmath0 dimensions , in the presence of a scalar potential @xmath42 .",
    "this is the same equation as obtained in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in principle the transformation ( [ eq : u ] ) could be applied before the coarse graining . this would affect the local behavior of the wannier functions and therefore the subleading terms of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fulleq ] ) , but not the leading diagonal term @xmath49 .",
    "summarizing , the present derivation shows that the mapping onto a dirac equation is justified when there exists a set of sufficiently localized wannier functions , in the _ rotated _ basis @xcite . though they do not appear explicitly in the final expression ( [ eq : simildirac ] ) , they are needed to warrant both the coarse graining procedure and the expansion ( [ eq : v - approx ] ) of the slowly varying potential @xcite .",
    "the existence of wannier functions with such properties will be discussed in the sections [ sec : mlwfs ] and [ sec : results ] .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section , the rotation ( [ eq : mixing ] ) with the angle given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) ( also combined with the constant transformation @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) ) , corresponds to the inverse free - particle foldy - wouthuysen ( fw ) transformation in the momentum representation ( that is , acting on the eigenstates of the dirac equation ) @xcite .",
    "we recall that the fw transformation is used to put the canonical _ free _ dirac equation into a convenient diagonal form , @xmath51 .",
    "this explains why here it is just the inverse fw transformation that allows to cast the original diagonal @xmath52 bloch hamiltonian into the dirac form .",
    "owing to the above point , we notice that when the potential @xmath42 is vanishing one could even apply the coarse graining procedure directly in the original bloch basis  without rotation  then claiming the equivalence with the dirac equation via the inverse fw cited above ( though , for practical purposes it might still be convenient to work with the canonical form , that is linear in the momentum operator @xmath53 . ) . however , the presence of the scalar potential @xmath42 dramatically changes the situation .",
    "in fact , though one has still to use the same inverse free fw transformation to reshape the original bloch hamiltonian in quasimomentum space , the corresponding transformation after the coarse graining would not lead to the dirac equation , as the potential @xmath42 does not commute with the momentum operator @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the exact fw transformation is not known .",
    "usually , it is customary to perform an expansion in @xmath54 , leading to the well known spin - orbit and _ zitterbewegung _ terms of the non relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "however , such an expansion is not useful in the present case , as here one is not interested in a the non - relativistic limit , but rather the opposite ( that is , simulating relativistic effects close to @xmath55 ) .",
    "indeed , the direct transformation that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : simildirac ] ) preserves all the relativistic contributions .",
    "among all possible choices , there exists a special class of wannier functions , the so - called maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) introduced by marzari and vanderbilt @xcite .",
    "these functions , obtained by means of a suitable unitary gauge transformation of the bloch eigenfunctions , are defined as those with the minimal spread , and can be constructed for both single or composite bands .",
    "their application to bichromatic optical lattices has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider explicitly the case of two almost degenerate bands , that is relevant to the present discussion .",
    "the single band mlwfs are obtained via a diagonal unitary transformation of the form @xmath56 , and correspond to the exponentially decaying wannier functions discussed by kohn @xcite . in general , it is convenient to define also a set of _ generalized _ mlwfs for composite bands , by means of a suitable gauge transformation obtained by parametrizing the most general @xmath52 unitary matrix @xcite . in the present case , the situation is complicated by the presence of the constraint ( [ eq : theta ] ) that fixes the mixing angle @xmath57 . in this case , the only freedom left is in the choice of the phases of the original bloch functions ( before the rotation ) .",
    "indeed , it is easy to prove that any other choice would spoil the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : rotatedh ] ) , introducing a different dependence on @xmath27 .",
    "then , in order to define a set of _ generalized _ mlwfs that satisfy the constraint ( [ eq : theta ] ) , one could proceed as follows .",
    "given an initial set of bloch functions @xmath58 ( that we suppose to be smooth functions of @xmath27 @xcite ) , the full transformation that minimizes the wannier functions by preserving the dirac form is @xmath59 ( in principle , one could also include the constant @xmath45 transformation , see sect [ sec : effectivedirac ] ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the gauge dependent part of the wannier spread , @xmath60 , can be expressed in terms of the generalized berry vector potentials @xmath61 as @xmath62 generally , the two contributions in the above expression can be minimized either simultaneously or independently , and in one dimension they can be made strictly vanishing , in the so - called _ parallel transport _",
    "gauge @xcite .",
    "however , since we want to preserve the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : rotatedh ] ) , in the present case we can only require @xmath60 to be minimum under the transformation ( [ eq : gauge ] ) , namely for @xmath63 notice that the diagonal gauge transformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge ] ) only affects the diagonal term containing @xmath64 , leaving unchanged the off diagonal term @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the latter is therefore fixed by the rotation @xmath66 . as a matter of fact , @xmath67 results in a complicated integro - differential expression , whose solution is very tough , even numerically .",
    "therefore , we shall adopt a different approach , as discussed in the following .",
    "as anticipated before , the coarse graining procedure is justified when the rotated wannier functions are sufficiently localized on the scale of the lattice spacing , not necessarily those maximally localized .",
    "so , a sufficient condition is to start with the single band mlwfs for the original bloch bands as considered by witthaut _",
    "@xcite , and verify that the rotation ( [ eq : mixing ] ) does not affect substantially their localization properties . in order to be quantitative , we shall use the normalized participation ratio @xmath68 as a measure of the extent of the wannier functions @xmath69 , in units of the lattice period @xmath3 .",
    "let us consider as examples the specific cases discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the periodic potential taking the form @xmath70 as for the potential amplitudes , here we consider two different sets , namely @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite or @xmath73 @xcite , with @xmath74 being the lattice recoil energy ( whose actual value is irrelevant here )",
    ". the two values of @xmath75 are very close but present subtle differences , as we shall discuss later on",
    ".    the bloch spectrum can be computed by a standard fourier decomposition @xcite . once the bloch functions have been ( numerically )",
    "obtained , one can compute the single band mlwfs by determining the phases @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the diagonal gauge transformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge ] ) , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and then using eq .",
    "( [ eq : blochwannier ] ) . at the same time",
    ", one can also evaluate the _ rotated _ mlwfs by using the full transformation ( [ eq : gauge ] ) , with the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 obtained from a fit of the energy dispersion around @xmath17 @xcite . regarding this point ,",
    "we have found that in the present regime of parameters , the bloch bands can not be exactly reproduced by the dispersion relation @xmath80 ( near @xmath17 ) as the independent fit of the two bands returns two different values for @xmath79 ( the value of @xmath78 is unambiguously fixed by the energy gap at @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , in practice , by taking the average value of the effective velocity , @xmath81 we get a reasonable description of the exact bloch bands .",
    "the actual values that we get for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the two cases in refs .",
    "@xcite are reported in tab . [ tab : mc ] for different values of the phase ( namely @xmath82 ) .",
    ".values of the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 for different values of phase @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the values in the table are in lattice units ( namely , energies in units of @xmath85 , velocities in units of @xmath86 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the mlwfs for the original bloch bands are shown in blue ( dotted - dashed line ) , those rotated in red ( solid line ) .",
    "here we use the set of parameters of salger _",
    "@xcite : @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",

    "@xcite respectively ) .",
    "in particular , there we show the single - band mlwfs ( blue dotted - dashed lines ) , and the corresponding _ rotated _ mlwfs defined above ( red solid lines ) .",
    "a number of comments are in order .",
    "firstly , it is obvious that in the `` relativistic '' @xcite case @xmath88 , the mass @xmath89 is almost vanishing , so that actually there is no rotation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) ) , and the two sets of wannier functions coincide ( panels ( c),(f ) ) .    then",
    ", it is noteworthy that  despite the similar values of the parameters  the cases of refs .",
    "@xcite present a different behavior , especially close to @xmath88 ( panels ( c),(f ) ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the two values @xmath73 and @xmath72 lie on different sides with respect to the degeneracy point corresponding to the exact crossing of the two bands , that we numerically locate at @xmath90 . as a consequence , the @xmath91-like solution centered at the deepest minima of the cell and the @xmath92-like centered at the tiny minimum on top of the potential exchange their role when crossing the resonance ( that is @xmath93 above the resonance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlwf - s ] , and vice versa below the resonance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlwf - w ] ) .    finally , the most important remark regards the localization properties of the wannier functions .",
    "remarkably , figs . [ fig : mlwf - s ] and [ fig : mlwf - w ] show that the rotation does not affect dramatically their localization properties , the _ rotated _ wannier functions having a behavior similar to the mlwfs for the original bloch band . as a matter of fact , though the two sets of wannier functions have a different `` microscopic '' structure , the corresponding values of the participation ration @xmath87 are not so different .    in order to complete the analysis , one has to check how the approximation ( [ eq : v - approx ] ) behaves under the rotation .",
    "this requires a precise analysis of the sub - leading terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fulleq ] ) , that we shall discuss in the following section .",
    "let us consider a generic _ slowly varying _ potential ( that used in refs .",
    "@xcite takes the form @xmath94 -fx$ ] ; the following treatment is valid in general ) . by performing a series expansion around @xmath95 , the potential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) can be written as @xmath96 so that the corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - approx ] ) read @xmath97 with @xmath98 being independent of @xmath99 owing to the invariance of the lattice under discrete translations .",
    "then , it is convenient to rescale the latter expression by the recoil energy @xmath85 and write it as @xmath100 where the term @xmath101 represents the variation of the potential on the scale of the lattice spacing @xmath3 , divided by the characteristic energy scale @xmath85 of the lattice . by hypothesis ,",
    "this term is small under the assumption of a slowly varying potential .",
    "then , in order to verify that the approximation ( [ eq : v - approx ] ) is justified , one has to check that the remaining term @xmath102 is sufficiently smaller than unity ( note that @xmath103 is actually independent of @xmath99 owing to the invariance of the lattice under discrete translations ) . in principle",
    ", one may expect this condition to be satisfied when the wannier functions are sufficiently localized within each lattice cell .",
    "indeed , we have verified that @xmath104 for @xmath105 for all the cases shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mlwf - s],[fig : mlwf - w ] .",
    "notice also that the actual value of the on - site diagonal term @xmath106 ( the only one depending on @xmath107 ) is not univocally determined ( though smaller than unity , anyway ) due to the arbitrariness in choosing the origin of the unit cell .",
    "we have revisited the derivation of the effective dirac equation for non - interacting ultracold atoms in optical lattices , discussing in particular the role played by the localization properties of the wannier functions entering the _ coarse graining _ approximation .",
    "though , remarkably , the choice of the wannier functions does not appear explicitly in the final dirac equation at leading order , the existence of a set of wannier functions sufficiently localized within each lattice cell , is a crucial requirement .",
    "we have shown that the wannier functions must be calculated from the _ rotated _ bloch basis , and that a reasonable option can be obtained by rotating the mlwfs for the original bloch bands .",
    "the above results eventually justify the use of the _ coarse graining _ approach , and account for the good agreement between the experimental results of salger _",
