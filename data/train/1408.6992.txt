    "this enhancement is related to the fact that , as a result of a proximity effect , a kondo resonance appears in the mott insulator due to the screening of the localized spins via the helical edge states.@xcite thus , the interface may be viewed as a kondo - lattice , where the metallicity is associated with the edge state induced by the topological band insulator .",

    "7(a ) ) can therefore serve as a signature of the kondo peak . in the second layer , only a weak remnant of this peak is observed .",
    "in contrast , the first layer of the band insulator is dominated by the van hove features of the one - dimensional metallic edge state . the deeper layers",
    "reveal the appearance of the bulk band gap , in close correspondence to the behavior at the bare surface shown in fig .",
    "5 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) , the dos near @xmath125 in the surface layer of the topological insulator is enhanced due to the presence of the mott insulator .",

    "[ fig7](a ) ) .",
    "thus , the kondo peak in the mott insulator gives rise , via the single - particle hopping across the interface , to a low - energy spectral feature at the surface of the topological band insulator .",
    "note that this feature is also present for @xmath149 .",
    "it is therefore not induced by the small local self - energy in the band insulator , but by the large self - energy in the neighboring layer exhibiting the kondo peak .",
    "this mechanism may therefore be viewed as a reverse proximity effect , in contrast to the usual one , in which the metal states induce the kondo peak in the mott insulator .",
    "this kind of feedback effect occurs also at interfaces between ordinary metals and mott insulators ( see , for instance , the small peak for @xmath150 in fig .  1 of ref .  ) . in the latter case",
    ", however , this effect is very small because of the dominant metallic dos . in the present heterostructure ,",
    "this effect is much more pronounced because of the minimum of the density of states of the edge state in the surface layer of the topological band insulator .",
    "so far we have discussed the formation of the kondo peak for @xmath126 and @xmath142 .",
    "returning to fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , we point out that , when the coulomb energy @xmath5 in the right - hand system is lowered , the maximum of the edge state shifts away from the interface toward the interior of the mott insulator . evidently , due the proximity of the topological band insulator , the topological band insulating phase is more stable in the surface region of the mott insulator , so that the effective boundary between the topological and mott phases moves away from the physical interface . from a numerical point of view , one observes that the self - energy and cluster parameters of the boundary layers are converted from those characteristic of the mott insulator phase to those characteristic of the topological insulator phase with increasing iterations , in a layer - by - layer fashion , starting from the first boundary layer , toward the interior of the mott insulator , until no further phase conversion of layers takes place .",
    "note that for the lowest two coulomb energies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) , the mott insulator is within the bulk coexistence region ( @xmath153 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , so that the actual phase depends sensitively on the properties near the interface . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the bulk mott insulator phase is more stable than the bulk topological insulator phase , so that the dos profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) does not shift any more with further iterations . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath151 seems to be very close to @xmath154 , so that one needs hundreds of iterations to reach the dos profile in fig .  [ fig7](a ) .",
    "it is to be noted that to ensure the persistence of the edge state at these coulomb energies , the bulk phase in the asymptotic region on the right - hand side is assumed to be mott insulating . as discussed in the previous subsection , if instead both constituents of the heterostructure are topological band insulators , the edge state disappears .    to illustrate this delicate balance between topological and mott insulating solutions in the interface region , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) the edge state for @xmath126 and @xmath140 . beyond the 15 surface layers of the right - hand system ,",
    "bulk mott insulating behavior is assumed .",
    "in addition , these 15 layers are initially assumed to be in the mott insulating phase . with increasing number of iterations , the peak of the edge state",
    "is seen to shift toward the right side of the embedded region .",
    "apparently , at @xmath140 , the bulk topological insulator phase is more stable than the bulk mott insulator phase , so that the conversion of layers from the mott phase to topological phase does not stop until all layers in the embedded region are converted .",
    "in other words , for this value of @xmath5 , one can not find a stable mott solution of the dmft equation in contrast to the cases with larger @xmath5 shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "the marked increase of spectral weight between layers 15 and 16 reflects the fact the nominal boundary of the heterostructure now comprises neighboring topological insulating phases for different values of @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",

    "the asymptotic value of @xmath135 on the right - hand side is very small because of the large size of the mott gap .",
    "for the same reason , the decay of the edge state in the mott insulator is more rapid than within the band insulator .",
    "the spatial distribution of this edge state is very similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] deep within the nominal mott insulator . as stated above , since @xmath155 is very close to @xmath154 at @xmath101 , the bulk topological insulator on the left - hand side and the bulk mott insulator on the right - hand side",

    "therefore , the dos profile in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] does not move with additional dmft iterations .",
    "evidently , the phenomenon observed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is a proximity effect , where the band insulating properties on one side of the interface are induced up to a certain depth on the other side , for instance , via the penetration of the edge state wave function across the boundary layer , although asymptotically this side is a mott insulator .",
    "the boundary between band and mott insulating phases then does not coincide with the nominal interface .",
    "the results discussed above suggest that the embedding scheme might be useful for the study of the relative stability of coexisting phases in dmft calculations .",
    "let us assume @xmath156 lies in the coexistence domain , with band insulating ( mott insulating ) properties enforced on the left ( right ) side of the embedded region .",
    "as long as @xmath157 , the topological band insulating solution is more stable , so that the edge state will be located at the right boundary of the embedded region .",
    "conversely , if @xmath158 , the mott phase is more stable , so that the edge state shifts toward the left boundary .",
    "the edge state at the interface between topological band and mott insulators has been investigated within inhomogeneous dmft .",
    "the generalized bernevig - hughes - zhang two - band model is used to describe the interplay between interorbital hybridization and local coulomb energy .",
    "the electronic properties in the vicinity of the interface are treated self - consistently by making use of the embedding scheme , where the effect of the asymptotic semi - infinite bulk materials is described in terms of complex local potentials .",
    "the finite - temperature exact diagonalization method is employed to evaluate the on - site many - body interactions .    the main result of this work is the observation that , close to the critical coulomb energy of the correlated topological insulator , the edge state is expelled from the interface toward the interior of the mott insulator .",
    "thus , as a result of the proximity with the topological band insulator , the mott insulating phase within a certain depth is converted to a topological band insulating phase , where the width of the conversion region depends on the local coulomb energy within the mott insulator . with increasing coulomb energy , the mott gap widens and the topological edge state is pushed again toward the interface .",
    "its decay within the mott insulator then becomes more rapid . at coulomb energies below the mott transition ,",
    "the edge state ceases to exist since in this case the interface corresponds to that between two weakly and moderately correlated topological band insulators .    the origin of the interface - induced conversion from mott insulating to band insulating behavior is the coexistence region associated with the first - order nature of the mott transition .",
    "depending on the temperature of the sample , either the mott insulating or the band insulating solution is more stable at a given value of the local coulomb energy .",
    "these results suggest that the embedding method might be useful to determine the relative stability of mott and band insulating phases in dmft calculations .",
    "in addition , the conversion between mott and band insulating phases might be observed experimentally in alloy heterostructures in which the existence of these phases can be tuned continuously by varying the material parameters .",
    "we have also shown that the normal proximity effect , where a kondo peak in a mott insulator is induced via neighboring metallic states , gives rise to a reverse proximity effect , where the kondo peak leads to an enhanced density of states at the surface of the neighboring metal .",
