    "the unruh effect states that a uniformly , linearly accelerated detector in the minkowski vacuum will experience thermal fluctuations at a temperature proportional to the proper acceleration of the detector  @xcite , called the unruh temperature .",
    "while the derivation is well established , direct observation of the unruh effect in laboratories is still lacking .",
    "one possible experimental evidence is the electron depolarization in storage rings , namely , the sokorov - ternov effect  @xcite , which can be directly connected to the ",
    "circular unruh effect \"  @xcite . nevertheless , the centripetal acceleration in the circular unruh effect is quite different in nature from the original linear , uniform acceleration in the unruh effect  @xcite . to get closer to the original conditions in unruh s derivation",
    ", people have proposed to look at the correction by the unruh effect to the radiation emitted by _",
    "linearly _ accelerated charges or atoms  @xcite , which is called the  unruh radiation \" .",
    "seeking the imprint of the unruh temperature in quantum radiation is not as straightforward as it appears . to define a finite temperature in a detector - field state",
    ", one needs a detector in equilibrium with the field .",
    "unfortunately , a uniformly , linearly accelerated detector ( analogous to an atom ) coupled to a massless scalar field in ( 1 + 1)d minkowski space emits no radiation in _ equilibrium _ conditions  @xcite . in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space",
    "there will be radiations by an unruh - dewitt ( ud ) detector  @xcite in steady state at late times ( with a constant radiating rate with respect to the proper time of the detector ) , but the radiated energy is not converted from the energy flux experienced by the detector in the unruh effect  @xcite .",
    "the interference between the vacuum fluctuations driving the detector and the radiation emitted by the driven detector is perfectly destructive in steady state .    in laboratories , however , it is impossible to produce any eternal constant linear acceleration for a charge or an atom .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors proposed to use an intense laser field to drive the charge motion , meaning that the acceleration is linear , oscillatory , but not uniform .",
    "a positive aspect of similar laser - driven experiments is that the charges or atoms are never in equilibrium conditions , so the quantum radiation may not be totally suppressed by interference .",
    "moreover , while temperature is not well defined in this non - equilibrium setup , we can still define a time - varying effective temperature whose value is close to the unruh temperature with the averaged acceleration of the oscillatory motion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we will demonstrate later , in the regime of high acceleration and short oscillating cycle of the motion , the signal of the effective unruh temperature can be pronounced in the quantum radiation .",
    "further , when observed in a fixed angle , there will be negative radiated energy flux in short periods during each cycle of oscillatory motion .",
    "this indicates that the unruh radiation observed at the null infinity corresponds to a squeezed state of the field  @xcite .",
    "we show our numerical results in section 4 , before which some technical issues are addressed in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "our model is the ud detector theory considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite : the _ internal _ harmonic oscillator is minimally coupled to a massless scalar field at the position of the point - like detector , while the worldline of the detector is not determined dynamically but given by a classical solution in electrodynamics with the radiation reaction neglected .",

    "as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by virtue of the linearity of the ud detector theory , the field operator @xmath2 after the detector - field coupling is switched on will become a linear combination of the mode functions each associated with a creation ( @xmath3 ) or annihilation operator ( @xmath4 ) of the free field , or a raising ( @xmath5 ) or lowering operator ( @xmath5 ) of the free detector @xmath6 . also due to the linearity , a mode function of the field has the form @xmath7}\\alpha}_{\\ ; x } + \\phi^{{}^{[1]}\\alpha}_{\\;x}$ ] ( @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and",

    "suppose right before the initial moment @xmath17 when the detector - field coupling is switched on , the combined system is in the factorized state @xmath18 , which is a product of the ground state of the free ud detector @xmath19 and the minkowski vacuum of the field @xmath20 .",

    ", for a fixed @xmath112 , a smaller @xmath111 on the one hand gives a smaller averaged proper acceleration @xmath99 , on the other hand it implies a longer period of oscillatory motion , so that the detector has more time to approach to the late - time state studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "both suppress the radiated energy .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath111 or @xmath99 increases , the importance of the interference terms decreases , and the full result of the radiated energy flux get closer to the naive result @xmath59 ( figure [ ctvarw ] ( right ) ) .",
