    "hasinger , miyaji and schmidt @xcite have employed two different methods to derive the agn1 x  ray luminosity function and its evolution .",
    "the first method uses a variant of the @xmath35 method , which was developed in @xcite . the binned luminosity function in a given redshift bin @xmath36",
    "is derived by dividing the observed number @xmath37 by the volume appropriate to the redshift range and the survey x  ray flux limits and solid angles . to evaluate the bias in this value caused by a gradient of the luminosity function across the bin ,",
    "each of the luminosity functions is fitted by an analytical function .",
    "this function is then used to predict @xmath38 .",
    "correcting the luminosity function by the ratio @xmath39 takes care of the bias to first order .",
    "the second method uses unbinned data .",
    "individual @xmath40 of the rbs sources are used to evaluate the zero - redshift luminosity function .",
    "this is free of the bias described above : using this luminosity function to derive the number of expected rbs sources matches the observed numbers precisely . in the subsequent derivation of the evolution , i.e. , the space density as a function of redshift , binning in luminosity and redshift",
    "is introduced to allow evaluation of the results .",
    "bias at this stage is avoided by iterating the parameters of an analytical representation of the space density function . together with the zero - redshift luminsity function",
    "this is used to predict @xmath41 for the surveys .",
    "the observed densities in the bins are derived by multiplying the space density value by the ratio @xmath42 . at this stage ,",
    "none of the densities are derived by dividing a number by a volume .",
    "the other difference between the two methods is in the treatment of missing redshifts for optically faint objects . in the binned method ,",
    "all agn without redshift with @xmath43 were assigned the central redshift of each redshift bin to derive an upper boundary to the luminosity function . in the unbinned method ,",
    "the optical magnitudes of the rbs sources were used to derive the optical redshift limit corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath40 values for surveys ( such as cdf ",
    "n ) spectroscopically incomplete beyond @xmath44 were based on the smaller of the x  ray and optical redshift limits .",
    "/n@xmath45 method , the dashed horizontal lines corresponding to the maximum contribution of unidentified sources .",
    "the thin and thick red lines and dots refer to the unbinned method ( from @xcite).,width=453 ]    figure [ fig : exlf ] shows the luminosity function derived this way in different redshift shells . a change of shape of the luminosity function with redshift is clearly seen and can thus rule out simple density or luminosity evolution models . in a second step , instead of binning into redshift shells , the sample has been cut into different luminosity classes and the evolution of the space density with redshift was computed .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_ma_ta ] shows a direct comparison between the binned and unbinned determinations of the space density , which agree very well within statistical errors .",
    "the fundamental result is , that the space density of lower ",
    "luminosity agn1 peaks at significantly lower redshift than that of the higher  luminosity ( qso  type ) agn . also , the amount of evolution from redshift zero to the peak is much less for lower  luminosity agn .",
    "the result is consistent with previous determinations based on less sensitive and/or complete data , but for the first time our analysis shows a high - redshift decline for all luminosities @xmath46  erg  s@xmath3 ( at higher luminosities the statistics is still inconclusive ) .",
    "albeit the different approaches and the still existing uncertainties , it is very reassuring that the general properties and absolute values of the space density are very similar in the two different derivations in .    a luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model has been fit to the data . even though the sample is limited to soft x",
    "ray - selected type1 agn , the parameter values of the overall ldde model are surprisingly close to those obtained by ueda et al .",
    "2003 for the intrinsic ( de - absorbed ) luminosity function of hard x  ray selected obscured and unobscured agn , except for the normalization , where ueda et al . reported a value about five times higher .",
    "these new results paint a dramatically different evolutionary picture for low ",
    "luminosity agn compared to the high  luminosity qsos . while the rare , high ",
    "luminosity objects can form and feed very efficiently rather early in the universe , with their space density declining more than two orders of magnitude at redshifts below z=2 , the bulk of the agn has to wait much longer to grow with a decline of space density by less than a factor of 10 below a redshift of one .",
    "the late evolution of the low ",
    "luminosity seyfert population is very similar to that which is required to fit the mid  infrared source counts and background @xcite and also the bulk of the star formation in the universe @xcite , while the rapid evolution of powerful qsos traces more the merging history of spheroid formation @xcite .",

    "<S> merging the _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ deep surveys with the previously identified _ rosat _ </S>",
    "<S> surveys a unique sample of almost 1000 agn1 covering five orders of magnitude in 0.52 kev flux limit and six orders of magnitude in survey solid angle with @xmath0 completeness has been constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity  redshift diagram is almost homogeneously filled . </S>",
    "<S> agn1 are by far the largest contributors to the soft x </S>",
    "<S>  ray selected samples . </S>",
    "<S> their evolution is responsible for the break in the total 0.52 kev source counts . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x  </S>",
    "<S> ray agn1 luminosity function shows a clear change of shape as a function of redshift , confirming earlier reports of luminosity  dependent density evolution for optical quasars and x  ray agn . the space density evolution with redshift changes significantly for different luminosity classes , showing a strong positive evolution , i.e. a density increase at low redshifts up to a certain redshift and then a flattening . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift , at which the evolution peaks , changes considerably with x  ray luminosity , from @xmath10.50.7 for luminosities @xmath2=4243 erg s@xmath3 to @xmath4 for @xmath2=4546 erg s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of density evolution from redshift zero to the maximum space density also depends strongly on x  ray luminosity , more than a factor of 100 at high luminosities , but less than a factor of 10 for low x  ray luminosities . for the first time , a significant decline of the space density of x  ray selected agn towards high redshift has been detected in the range @xmath2=4245 erg s@xmath3 , while at higher luminosities the survey volume at high  redshift is still too small to obtain meaningful densities . a comparison between x  ray and optical properties shows now significant evolution of the x  ray to optical spectral index for agn1 . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints from the agn luminosity function and evolution in comparison with the mass function of massive dark remnants in local galaxies indicates , that the average supermassive black hole has built up its mass through efficient accretion ( @xmath5 ) and is likely rapidly spinning . </S>"
