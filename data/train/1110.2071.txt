    "one of the main obstacles for the maturity of electric cars is the development of a high - capacity , cheap and safe rechargeable battery .",
    "the most widely used cathode material is by far licoo@xmath3 @xcite , however , cobalt is very expensive and there is a strong driving force to find new cheaper and environmental friendly cathode materials .",
    "one of the big problems for battery application is the structural distortions that occur when large amount of li is removed @xcite .",
    "some efforts have been made to minimize these effects e.g. by the combination of co and ni into a lini@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath3 solid solution .",

    ", we ensured that the side facing the muon beamline was only covered by a single layer of mylar tape .",
    "subsequently , @xmath33sr spectra were measured at the swiss muon source ( s@xmath34s ) , paul scherrer institut , villigen , switzerland . by using the muon beamline @xmath35e1 and the dolly spectrometer , zero - field ( zf ) and weak transverse - field ( wtf ) spectra",

    "2(a ) , weak transverse - field ( wtf  =  50  g ) @xmath6sr spectra were obtained as a function of temperature . below @xmath37",
    "k a total suppression of the externally applied field is seen as annihilation of the wtf asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the data is found to be well fitted by a combination of an exponentially relaxing cosine oscillation and a fast relaxing component : @xmath38 from such fits , the temperature dependence of @xmath31 can be extracted and a clearer picture of the transition is obtained [ fig .",
    "moving from low to high temperature : at @xmath37  k an evident transition occurs and @xmath31 is linearly recovered up until @xmath39  k. from the ac - susceptibility data shown above , this temperature is identified as the 3d cluster glass ( cg ) transition ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .",

    "2(b ) , only 50% of the total @xmath31 is recovered in this transition .",
    "the remainder is thereafter more slowly restored within the ferrimagnetic quasi long - range ordered phase @xcite and finally reaches its full value at @xmath8  k.    to obtain a more detailed view of the nature of the magnetic order and transitions in this compound , also zero - field ( zf ) data was recorded . at the lowest temperature ( @xmath7  k ) , the @xmath6sr time spectrum show no indication of spontaneous muon precession , but rather only a very fast decaying signal , indicating either a wide field - distribution ( typical for spin - glasses ) or the presence of dynamical correlations . to obtain an adequate distinction between these two cases , a longitudinal - field ( lf ) experiment",
    "would be needed , where the static contribution could be decoupled .",
    "however , from the information obtained in our magnetometry data , the static case seems more likely .",
    "the zf data was found to be well fitted to the sum of a very fast exponentially relaxing signal , a slower decaying stretched - exponential @xcite function and a powder average tail component : @xmath41 } + a_{\\rm tail}\\cdot{}e^{-\\lambda_{\\rm tail } t~ } , \\label{eq : zffit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the temperature dependent measurements displayed in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the evolution of the two components is evident . at low temperature",
    "the fast relaxing component is dominating .",

    "k , the slowly relaxing component has completely taken over .",
    "this kind of stretched exponential relaxation is found to appear in a range of different systems .",
    "however , they are commonly connected to spin - glasses and systems containing magnetic frustration i.e. like the title compound . the critical exponent @xmath43 is known to depend on the effective dimensionality ( @xmath44 ) of the system above ( but in the vicinity of ) a transition according to @xmath45 . in li(ni@xmath4co@xmath5mn@xmath5)o@xmath16 , @xmath43 display a strong temperature evolution . at @xmath46",
    "k , @xmath47 i.e. a gaussian relaxation ( or possible kubo - toyabe behavior ) indicating the presence of random moments . with lowering of the temperature , @xmath43 drastically starts to decrease around @xmath48  k and close to 20 k , @xmath49 , indicating a strongly decreased dimensionality ( 2d or 1d ) just above @xmath40 .",
    "this could be a signature for the onset of the previously reported glassy transition in 2d and 3d , respectively @xcite arising from the structurally induced frustration on the 2d triangular lattice .",
    "it is also tempting to connect the onset of decrease in @xmath43 to the kink found in the ac - susceptibility data [ seee fig .",
    "however , further measurements including a more detailed temperature dependence is needed in order to clarify this matter more robustly .",

    "wtf data show how the localized magnetic moments are gradually building up in steps over an extended @xmath50-range .",
    "moreover , the zf results show a spin glass state at the lowest temperatures with a transition ( on heating ) from a 3d to a 2d spin glass state around 20 k. the absence of long - range magnetic order , even at the lowest temperature measured , could be directly connected to magnetic frustration of the 2d triangular lattice . with further increasing temperature",
