    "precision measurements allow us to probe physics at much higher energy scales than the masses of the particles directly involved in experimental reactions by exploiting contributions from quantum loops .",
    "a prominent example is the global fit of the standard model ( sm ) to electroweak precision data , routinely performed by the lep electroweak working group and others ( for latest results see  @xcite ) , which demonstrated impressively the predictive power of electroweak unification and quantum loop corrections . several theoretical libraries within and beyond the sm have been developed in the past , which allowed to constrain the unbound parameters of the sm and models of new physics .",
    "however , most of these programs are relatively old , were implemented in outdated programming languages , and are difficult to maintain in line with the theoretical and experimental progress expected during the forthcoming era of the lhc .",
    "these considerations led to the development of the generic fitting package _",
    "gfitter _",
    "@xcite , designed to provide a modular framework for complex fitting tasks in high - energy physics , like model testing and parameter estimation problems .",
    "_ gfitter _ is implemented in c++ and relies on root functionality .",
    "it consists of a core package providing the tools for data handling , fitting and statistical analyses and allows a consistent treatment of statistical , systematic and theoretical errors , possible correlations , and inter - parameter dependencies .",
    "tools provided for statistical analyses include e.g. parameter scans , contours , monte carlo ( mc ) toy analyses and goodness - of - fit @xmath2-value evaluation .",
    "more details on the framework can be found at  @xcite . _",
    "gfitter _ performs the minimisation of a @xmath6 test statistics quantifying the deviation of the experimental data from the predictions in a certain physics model .",
    "the theoretical calculations are implemented via plug - in libraries for the _ gfitter _ framework . in this paper",
    "we report results which are obtained using the first libraries implemented in the _ gfitter _ package : sm predictions of the electroweak precision observables and predictions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 physics observables in a model with two higgs doublets ( 2hdm ) .",
    "in the global electroweak fit with _ gfitter _",
    "state - of - the - art calculations are compared with the most recent experimental data to constraint the free parameters of the fit and to test the goodness - of - fit .",
    "the sm parameters relevant for the global electroweak analysis are the coupling constants of the electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions , and the masses of the elementary bosons and fermions .",
    "electroweak unification and simplifications arising from fixing parameters with insignificant uncertainties compared to the sensitivity of the fit allow to reduce the number of free fit parameters .",
    "the remaining free parameters are the coupling parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the masses @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in addition , four free parameters enter to include the theoretical uncertainties of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the electroweak form factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    for the prediction of the electroweak precision observables",
    "as measured by the lep , slc and tevatron experiments the most up - to - date calculations are implemented in the _ gfitter _",
    "sm library using the oms scheme .",
    "wherever possible the results have been cross - checked against the zfitter package  @xcite .",

    "the partial and total widths of the @xmath18 are known to leading order , while for the second order only the leading @xmath19 corrections are available . among the new developments included",
    "is the nnnlo perturbative calculation of the massless qcd adler function  @xcite , contributing to the vector and axial - vector radiator functions in the prediction of the @xmath18 hadronic width ( and other observables ) .",

    "we perform global fits in two versions : the _ standard ( `` blue - band '' ) fit _ makes use of all the available information except for the direct higgs searches ; the _ complete fit _ uses also the constraints from the direct higgs searches .    due to the restricted space available",
