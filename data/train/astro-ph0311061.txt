    "for the low gas : dust ratio case , the upper regions of the disk are predominantly atomic while the midplane consists of cooler molecular material .",
    "the line - of - sight intercepts the upper layer of atomic hydrogen but few molecules of cooler h@xmath3 .",
    "the surface density , @xmath75 , in the simple model is a gaussian superimposed on a @xmath118 power law while the surface density in the chemical model is only described by a @xmath118 power law . despite the difference in assumed functions ,",
    "the surface densities in the models agree to within a factor of two at all radii in the disk suggesting that this difference can not account for the discrepancy in the predicted column densities .",
    "the circumstellar disk around hr 4796 probably possesses @xmath51.0 @xmath9 which corresponds to a gas : dust ratio @xmath54.0 although a gas : dust ratio of 100 can not be definitively ruled out .",
    "the atmosphere of a giant planet contains approximately 275 @xmath9 of h@xmath3 ( tholen , tejfel , & cox 2000 ) .",
    "this is substantially more than either @xmath51.0 @xmath9 circumstellar gas we infer to exist around hr 4796a or even the @xmath55.0 @xmath9 gas that would exist if the gas : dust ratio were interstellar .",
    "therefore , there is currently not enough circumstellar gas around hr 4796a to form the atmosphere of a jovian planet .",
    "if jupiters exist around hr 4796a , they must have formed within @xmath08 myr , significantly less time than is required by multi - stage accumulation ( 10 - 100 myr ) .",
    "we have obtained ultraviolet spectra ( 905   - 1187  , 1425   - 1620  , 1880   - 2155  ) of the nearby , debris disk object hr 4796a using _ fuse _ and stis on _",
    "we argue the following :    \\1 . the x - ray flux from the m - dwarf companion hr 4796b does not significantly heat circumstellar gas around hr 4796a .",
    "the estimated x - ray heating rate is at least @xmath040 times smaller than the estimated photoelectric heating rate .",
    "circumstellar gas around hr 4796a may be warmed to a temperature @xmath4 @xmath0 65 k by photoelectric heating if the gas : dust ratio is 4 , suggesting a molecular gas disk thickness parameter @xmath68 = 6.1 au and an atomic gas disk thickness parameter @xmath68 = 8.1 au at 70 au from the star .",
    "this is approximately consistent with detailed heating and cooling models which suggest a maximum gas temperature , @xmath4 61 k , for a gas : dust ratio of 2 , assuming a 1-d approximation for the escape probability of line photons .",
    "the circumstellar disk around hr 4796a possesses very little @xmath74 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath51.1 @xmath17 @xmath119 @xmath9 h@xmath3 exists around hr 4796a assuming that gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is well - mixed , and has a temperature t@xmath7 = 65 k.    \\4 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath51.0 @xmath9 atomic hydrogen exists around hr 4796a .",
    "this corresponds to a gas : dust mass ratio @xmath54.0 assuming that gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is well - mixed , and has a temperature t@xmath7 = 65 k.    \\5",
    ". measurements of column density may provide the strongest constraint on the gas mass in the hr 4796a circumstellar disk . while the measured h@xmath3 , co , and column densities are consistent with the column densities predicted for the gas : dust ratio = 100 model , the measured column denisty n ( ) = @xmath115 @xmath12 is most consistent with the gas : dust ratio = 2 model .",
