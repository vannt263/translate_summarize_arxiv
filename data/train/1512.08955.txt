    "year 2015 saw publication of two papers @xcite dealing with non - trivial extensions of abjm theories , namely @xmath3-quivers .",
    "they calculated the free energy explicitly using similar approaches ( fermi gas formalism@xcite ) and verified the result ( in large @xmath4 limit ) we ` conjectured ' in @xcite .",
    "the free energy of such field theories , defined by logarithm of the sphere partition function , is related to the gravitational free energy via ads / cft as follows @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the volume of a 7-dimensional ( tri-)sasaki - einstein manifold .",
    "it is believed that the m - theoretical description of these field theories arises as the near - horizon limit of a stack of @xmath4 m2-branes located at the tip of a 8-dimensional calabi - yau cone with @xmath7 as its base .",
    "there have also been a lot of work dealing with trivial deformations and hence computations of partition functions and/or study of phases of abjm ( and related ) theories . for an incomprehensive list of papers from last year ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "so we decided to merge these recent developments and considered calculating the free energy of @xmath3-quivers deformed by fi parameters . we find that by using complex fi parameters , the free energy expressions can be interpreted as coming from a quiver theory with vanishing fi paramters but with non - canonical r - charges assigned to the bifundamental matter fields ( along the lines discussed in @xcite for abjm theory ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief review of the field theory setup to be discussed here .",
    "then in section [ solution ] , we will give the algorithm to solve ( and solution of ) the matrix models for @xmath3-quivers , which allows us to write down the general volume formula with non - zero fi parameters .",
    "we will also discuss how to get the ( non - canonical ) r - charges for the bifundamental matter fields out of these expressions . finally ,",
    "before we conclude in section [ discussion ] , we do the same analysis for @xmath8-quivers in appendix [ asol appendix ] .",
    "appendix [ a and d appendix ] contains our conventions for roots of affine @xmath9 and @xmath10 lie algebras , which are used to relabel cs levels for the corresponding quiver diagrams .",
    "we will consider quiver chern - simons - yang - mills gauge theories involving products of unitary groups , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , coupled to bifundamental hypermultiplets and some fundamentals . according to @xcite ,",
    "the partition function of these theories on @xmath12 is localized on configurations where the auxiliary scalar fields @xmath13 in the @xmath14 vector multiplets are constant @xmath15 matrices .",
    "thus , evaluating the free energy amounts to solving a matrix model . also , the free energy depends non - trivially on two sets of parameters in the theory : cs levels @xmath16 and fi parameters @xmath17 associated with a node ` @xmath18 ' .",
    "( the labelling of nodes for @xmath3-quivers is shown in figure [ fig : dn ] . )",

    "these models are not ( super)conformal as we will see later that the nonvanishing fi parameters can be interpreted as non - canonical r - charges for the bifundamental fields .",
    "there is also a mirror duality ( for @xmath28 ) in ir which relates @xmath29 s and fundamental hypermultiplet masses @xmath30",
    "s @xcite implying that the two mirror theories are related by an exchange of their coulomb and higgs branch . even if the theories we consider are not at their superconformal fixed point(s ) , the free energy formula continues to hold as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , given such a free energy formula , one can consider ` extremizing ' it with respect to the r - charges ( subject to some constraints like their sum takes a particular value and so on ) and obtain the free energy at an ir fixed point along some ( un)known rg flow ( see @xcite for many examples in abjm - type theories ) .",
    "we will not discuss these issues any further and point the reader to the literature ( some of which we already mentioned ) and/or leave it as a homework exercise .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath13 in each vector multiplet by @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the sphere partition function",
    "is then given by @xmath33 where the contribution from vector multiplets is @xmath34 \\bigg)^2 { e^{2 i _{a , j}_a _{a , j } + \\pi i \\sum_{a , j } k_a \\lambda_{a , j}^2}},\\ ] ] and from matter multiplets is @xmath35 } \\prod_c \\bigg(\\prod_i \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh[\\pi \\lambda_{c , i}]}\\bigg)^{n^f_c}.\\ ] ] the first product in @xmath36 is due to the bifundamental fields while the second one is due to the fundamental flavour fields , where @xmath37 is the number of pairs of these flavour fields at the node labelled by index @xmath38 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the eigenvalue distribution becomes dense in the large @xmath4 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 with a certain density @xmath42 . in this limit",
    "the free energy becomes a 1-dimensional integral which we evaluate by saddle point approximation .",
    "we also assume that the eigenvalue distribution for a node with @xmath43 is given by a collection of @xmath44 curves in the complex plane labelled by @xmath45 with @xmath46 and write the ansatz @xmath47 the eigenvalue density at each node is assumed to be given by @xmath42 , which satisfies @xmath48 this normalization condition will be imposed through a lagrange multiplier @xmath49 below . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "the leading order in @xmath4 in the saddle point equation is proportional to the combination @xmath50 .",
    "the requirement that this term vanishes is equivalent to the quiver being in correspondence with the simply laced extended dynkin diagrams , leading to the well - known @xmath51 classification .    to leading order in @xmath4 ,",
    "the free energy contains a tree - level contribution and a 1-loop contribution .",
    "assuming @xmath52 and the requirement that these two contributions are balanced leads to @xmath53 , which is ultimately responsible for the @xmath54 scaling of the free energy .",
    "finally , the free energy to be extremized reads @xmath55 dx { \\nonumber\\\\}&\\qquad -2   n^{\\sfrac{3}{2 } } { \\left(}\\int \\rho(x)\\ , dx -1{\\right)}\\ ! , \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "we note that the real part of @xmath17 does not appear in @xmath59 at the leading order in @xmath4 ( a fact verifiable via ` numerical experiments ' ) .",
    "also , notice that the integrand for free energy is no longer symmetric along the ` @xmath60-axis ' due to the appearance of @xmath61 term .",
    "this is a non - trivial statement whose first consequence is that the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not symmetric anymore under @xmath64 .",
    "second serious consequence is that our algorithm of @xcite for solving such matrix models is no longer directly applicable and we have to take care of the ` negative ' @xmath60-axis too .",
    "however , evaluating the free energy on - shell still gives the same simple relation @xmath65 as proven earlier in @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is determined by @xmath49 , which in turn is determined as a function of the cs levels and fi parameters from the normalization condition ( [ normalization rho ] ) .",
    "note that from ( [ f vol ] ) and ( [ fproptomu ] ) , it follows that @xmath66    it is convenient to relate the cs level @xmath67 at each node to a root @xmath68 , by introducing a ( @xmath69-dimensional ) vector @xmath70 and writing @xmath71 . this way , the condition @xmath52 is satisfied automatically .",
    "see appendix  [ a and d appendix ] for an explicit basis .",
    "this is the main section where we discuss the * algorithm * to solve the matrix model for deformed @xmath3-quivers and present the general * volume * formula .",
    "we also present the associated * cone * construction and relate the parameter @xmath61 to non - canonical * r - charges * of the bifundamental fields .",
    "let us proceed in this precise order .",
    "following our algorithm from @xcite : _ extremizing ( [ f ] ) ( with respect to @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) requires an assumption on the branch of the arg functions .",
    "we will always take the principle value and therefore we assume that @xmath74 based on numerical results @xcite , we assume that the @xmath44 curves for a given node initially coincide , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath75",
    ". extremizing @xmath59 under these assumptions , one finds that the solution is consistent only in a bounded region away from the origin .",
    "this is because as @xmath76 increases , the differences @xmath77 monotonically increase ( or decrease ) , saturating one ( or more ) of the inequalities assumed in ( [ inequalities ] ) at some point .",
    "_    this is the place where our previous algorithm fails because saturation on positive @xmath60-axis no longer implies saturation on negative @xmath60-axis due to the notorious asymmetry of the integrand in @xmath59 .",
    "however , all is not lost and after considering a few cases , a consistent choice can be made for saturation points @xmath78 on negative @xmath60-axis from the knowledge of @xmath79 only . here s the rule : @xmath80 this rule may seem to be picked out of thin air but its origin will become clear in a while . after this , our old algorithm can proceed without ( m)any problems .    _",
    "the relation among the cs levels determines the sequence in which these inequalities saturate .",
    "this saturation will be maintained beyond this point , requiring the eigenvalue distribution involved either to bifurcate or develop a kink .",
    "after a saturation occurs , the total number of independent variables is reduced by one .",
    "thus , at this point , we remove one variable from the lagrangian , revise the inequalities and solve the equations of motion again until a new saturation is encountered .",
    "this process is iterated until all @xmath81 s are related , determining a maximum of @xmath82 regions or until the eigenvalue distribution terminates , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath83 .",
    "once the eigenvalue density @xmath42 is determined in all regions , the value of @xmath49 ( and therefore @xmath59 ) is found from the normalization condition ( [ normalization rho ] ) .",
    "_    we apply this modified algorithm first for @xmath8 series as a sanity / consistency check .",
    "a sample plot of eigenvalue density for @xmath84 is shown in figure [ fig : a2 ] .",
    "for @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( orange ) and @xmath86 ( blue ) . ]",
    "but the great insight about @xmath61 is obtained by considering @xmath87 quiver following @xcite .",
    "it is revealed that this parameter can be related to non - canonical r - charges of the bifundamental fields . the specific relation being @xmath88 where @xmath9 denotes a bifundamental field in representation @xmath89 and @xmath90 denotes @xmath91 .",
    "of course , when @xmath29 s vanish , @xmath92 s reduce to their canonical value of @xmath93 .",
    "we relegate the rest of the discussion for @xmath8-quivers to the appendix [ asol appendix ] because generalizing solution for @xmath3-quivers is much more straightforward .",
    "we will assume that @xmath92 s and @xmath61 can be similarly related in the case of @xmath3-quivers too and eventually conjecture the leading order of @xmath59 in terms of these r - charges .",
    "the simplest example from @xmath3 series is the @xmath94 quiver whose essence is captured by the figures [ fig : d4rho ] and [ fig : d4ys ] .     for @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . ]",
    "s for @xmath94 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "( we have set @xmath99 . ) ]    as discussed , @xmath62 and @xmath63 s are clearly no longer symmetric across the @xmath60-axis .",
    "now we turn to the simpler task of integrating the density to get the volume formula .",
    "we think that giving some test cases is always a good idea before unleashing the grandeur of a general formula so here are two expressions for volumes of @xmath94 and @xmath100 : @xmath101\\! \\label{sol d4 } \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{8\\mu^2 } & = \\frac{1}{48}\\left[-\\frac{1}{n_f+2t_+6 p_1 } -\\frac{3}{n_f+2(t_+p_1 + 2 p_2 ) } + \\frac{12(n_f+2t_+2 p_1 + 2 p_2 + 3 p_3 - p_4)}{\\big(n_f+2(t_+p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\\big)^2}\\right . { \\nonumber\\\\}&\\quad-\\left.\\frac{3}{n_f+2(t_+p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 - p_5 ) } -\\frac{3}{n_f+2(t_+p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5)}+()\\right]\\! \\label{sol d5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have used the inequalities : @xmath102 or equivalently @xmath103 in our explicit calculations .",
    "we recall from @xcite that the above volume formula can be generalized in terms of @xmath104 2-dimensional vectors @xmath105 s . here",
    ", we will need @xmath106 together with @xmath107 , ( modify @xmath108 to ) @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . defining the wedge product @xmath111 , we can introduce modified @xmath112 s in terms of @xmath113 as follows @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes negating the second component of @xmath116",
    ". obviously , @xmath117 on @xmath118 refers to the presence ( if any ) of @xmath119 on the right - hand side .",
    "this finally leads to the compact volume formula for @xmath3-quivers @xmath120 note that this sum does not contain @xmath121 because of its redundancy as @xmath122 and the fact that terms with @xmath123 give the same contributions as @xmath124 .",
    "the two sums above are a consequence of @xmath62 not being reflection - symmetric across @xmath60-axis .",
    "of course when all @xmath125 , @xmath126 reduce to @xmath118 of @xcite and the overall factor adds up to a @xmath93 .    setting all @xmath29 s and @xmath127 s to zero above",
    ", we simply get ( from @xmath128 only ) for the free energy @xmath129 which exactly matches the large @xmath4 limit of the ` airy function ' derived using fermi gas formalism in @xcite : @xmath130 when we relate @xmath131 and @xmath132 . as mentioned there , these theories are dual to @xmath133 @xmath134-branes at an orbifold singularity in @xmath135 such that the backreacted geometry in large @xmath4 limit is @xmath136 .",
    "so @xmath137 which matches with the above @xmath138-orbifolding of @xmath139 .",
    "quivers ( see appendix [ asol appendix ] ) whose associated @xmath140 @xcite gives @xmath141 ]      in our previous paper @xcite , we also gave a ( convoluted ) cone construction for the volume formula , such that each term ( @xmath142 ) corresponded to the area of a triangle used to triangulate the cone .",
    "generalizing that construction to the above @xmath29-deformed volume is straightforward but we can do better here by writing down one simple equation describing the complete polygon ( not just the cone ) .",
    "this is done by generalizing the ` cone ' construction pioneered in the fermi gas formalism for ` pure ' @xmath3-quivers @xcite : @xmath143 figure [ fig : d4cone ] shows some polygons ( and a cone ) for @xmath94 quiver",
    ".     @xmath144 for pure @xmath94 ; [ orange ] @xmath144 ( still symmetric ) for flavoured @xmath94 ; [ green ] @xmath144 ( notice the asymmetry ) for flavoured@xmath145deformed @xmath94 ; [ grey ] @xmath146 using @xcite s original construction such that @xmath147 gives the exact volume formula for @xmath94 . ]",
    "it should not be surprising if folding / unfolding procedure works as before ( but we wo nt discuss it here ) .",
    "what we will emphasize here is that the ` @xmath59-theorem ' clearly holds for these @xmath29-deformed quivers .",
    "this is because the cone expands to cover more area as @xmath148 and/or @xmath27 , which leads to a decrease in @xmath59 since they are inversely proportional .      keeping this trivial construction aside , we go back to the full expression now and try to figure out the non - canonical r - charges of the matter fields .",
    "( for simplicity , we continue our analysis with @xmath149 set to zero . )",
    "let s look at the generic inequality ( instead of for @xmath150 s ) in such a case@xcite : @xmath151 we see clearly that @xmath152 decides saturation points on the positive @xmath60-axis and @xmath153 on the negative , thus corroborating our observation for choice of @xmath154 in the algorithm section . the easiest way to see this is to choose a particular @xmath150 to be the ` baseline ' such that all bifurcations of @xmath150 s are in first and third quadrant ( forget figure [ fig : d4ys ] in this regard ) .",
    "furthermore , we do not have to solve the matrix model again to get the feel of where all these @xmath92 s can appear in the volume formula .",
    "we can just look at these inequalities and the list of saturation points in the case of canonical r - charges .",
    "why ? because the expressions for saturation points are directly related to the @xmath155 s .",
    "this hand - waving quick analysis gives us the following identification @xmath156 the index @xmath18 is misleading but the point is that there are as many pairs of bifundamental fields in a @xmath3-quiver as there are ` independent ' @xmath155 s so this identification is fool - proof ( modulo linear combinations because a priori there is no reason that a single @xmath155 should be associated to a particular @xmath92 ) .",
