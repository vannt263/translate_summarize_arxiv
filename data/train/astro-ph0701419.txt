    "the observational properties of galaxies at any given epoch are a direct result of their formation and evolution histories",
    ". theories of galaxy formation traditionally adhere to one of two vastly different paradigms  either monolithic collapse ( mc ) or hierarchical clustering ( hc ) . in the mc scenario all galaxy types and sizes are created at high redshift by the rapid collapse of primordial gas clouds @xcite .",
    "subsequent evolution is then primarily passive with minimal interaction between nearby neighbours . alternatively , under the hc scheme larger galaxies are progressively built from smaller ones during the hierarchical merging of their host dark matter ( dm ) haloes @xcite . within the hc framework ,",
    "disc galaxies are the first morphological types formed in the early universe , while ellipticals are constructed from mergers of similar - sized discs over roughly a hubble time @xcite . +",
    "numerous observational studies have provided evidence to support or contradict each of these paradigms , and recent revisions to both theories have been made in light of such findings .",
    "for instance , the homogeneity in the early - type colour - magnitude relation from different clusters @xcite suggests that these galaxies formed at @xmath10 , which favours mc over hc .",
    "however , a number of imaging studies ( such as @xcite ) have reported a deficit of distant ellipticals with passively - evolving colours  contradicting the historic mc scenario of a single burst of star - formation in the early universe .",
    "a so - called ` reformed monolithic collapse ' model @xcite has the majority of stars forming at high redshift , but with secondary episodes of star - formation at low redshift caused by internal processes .",
    "@xcite advocate an adaptation of hc by incorporating ` dry mergers ' , in which the brightest ellipticals grow in size by gas - poor mergers with other ellipticals .",
    "this picture is motivated by their discovery of a factor of 2 increase in stellar mass on the red ( i.e. , passively evolving ) sequence since @xmath11 in the combo-17 survey data .",
    "this result is consistent with studies of partially - depleted cores in elliptical galaxies , which indicate such galaxies have experienced , on average , one dry merger @xcite .",
    "some authors ( such as @xcite ) have developed theories outside of either paradigm using the so - called ` backward ' approach , whereby high redshift galaxy properties are inferred from detailed studies of the star - formation history of the milky way and other local galaxies .",
    "they offer the alternative ` infall ' model whereby a radially - dependent global star - formation rate means galaxies form from the inside out .",
    "others , such as @xcite , advocate in a purely qualitative manner a mixed model in which bulges form first via a rapid collapse or merger phase forming the bulge with subsequent disc formation through splashback and infall .",
    "+ recent multi - wavelength , deep imaging surveys ( e.g.  the hdfs , goods , gems , cosmos and the udf ) have provided a wealth of data for empirical studies of high redshift galaxy evolution , which can test and constrain the above - mentioned formation theories .",
    "for example , @xcite compare the photometric redshift distribution and morphologies of galaxies in the goods southern field to theoretical expectations .",
    "in the important @xmath12 regime where the models strongly diverge , they observe an excess number density relative to the mc prediction and a deficit relative to the hc one .",
    "however , the disturbed morphologies of objects in their high redshift sample are interpreted as evidence in favour of the general framework of hierarchical formation .",
    "@xcite present a selection of galaxies at @xmath13 in the udf with compact , early - type morphologies and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) consistent with passively evolving stellar populations .",
    "they demonstrate that the space density of these galaxies at @xmath14 is only a factor of 2 - 3 smaller than that of their local counterparts . at first glance",
    "the prevalence of such galaxies in the early universe is difficult to explain within the hc theory , in which luminous ellipticals should be the last galaxy types to form .",
    "however , @xcite argue that ` down - sizing ' behaviour , for elliptical galaxy star formation , is actually an inherent property of hierarchical formation in their @xmath15cdm cosmological simulations . +",
    "a number of authors have attempted to quantify luminosity and size ( or surface brightness ) evolution in the galaxy population to high redshift using deep imaging surveys . for bright galaxies ( @xmath16 mag ) , the distributions of these two key observables",
    "are well constrained locally  both individually , as the luminosity function @xcite and size function @xcite , and in bi - variate space , as the luminosity - size distribution ( or lsd , @xcite ) .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to make robust comparisons between galaxy samples drawn from different epochs due to the impact of redshift and surface brightness dependent selection effects , such as the @xmath17 cosmological surface brightness dimming . fortunately though , the luminosity - size plane is the natural domain in which to confront such observational biases @xcite , and deep",
    ", space - based imaging can push back the low surface brightness , faint magnitude and compact size boundaries ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite study early - type , red galaxies in the gems survey and find evidence for evolution in the lsd consistent with the passive fading of ancient stellar populations . in particular , they report a @xmath71.0 mag increase ( @xmath18-band ) at small sizes ( @xmath19 @xmath20 kpc ) to @xmath21 and a @xmath70.7 mag increase for larger sizes to @xmath22 . considering disc - dominated galaxies in the gems survey ,",
    "@xcite find strong evolution of @xmath71.0 mag arcsec@xmath8 in @xmath18-band surface brightness to @xmath11 , but a constant stellar - mass - size relation over this time .",
    "their results best fit the predictions of the infall model of galaxy formation . @xcite",
    "have recently combined deep , near - ir imaging of the hdf - s and ms1054 - 03 fields with the sdss ( @xmath9 ) and gems ( @xmath23 ) surveys .",
    "they present evidence of size evolution at fixed luminosity of @xmath24 for early - types and @xmath25 for late - types ( in rest - frame @xmath18-band ) out to @xmath26 , and reach similar conclusions to the other two studies mentioned above .",

    "these are compared to a local benchmark from the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) and the degree of evolution quantified .",

    "however , as no kron magnitudes were provided we elected to generate our own object catalogue as described below .",
    "this also allowed us to make our own decisions regarding deblending of irregular sources .",
    "+      a preliminary source extraction was performed using the starlink implementation ( extractor v1.4 - 3 ) of the popular sextractor package @xcite .",
    "the threshold for both detection and analysis of our objects was set to a constant surface brightness of 27.395 mag arcsec@xmath42 and a uniform background adopted .",
    "the minimum number of connected pixels to register a detection was set to 9 , which is consistent with the size of the psf fwhm ( @xmath7@xmath43 ) .",
    "two parameters critical to object deblending are the minimum contrast value and the number of deblending sub - thresholds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our choices were identical to those used in generating the on - line catalogue , namely 0.03 and 32 respectively .",
    "an abnormally high number of spurious detections were found along the edge of the image mosaic where there are fewer stacked exposures and the signal - to - noise is poor .",
    "objects with centroids inside these regions , which extend @xmath7100 pixels ( 3@xmath41 ) in from the field boundary , were removed from the source catalogue .",
    "the constant background approach was chosen to avoid additional biases against faint , extended galaxies that can arise in a mesh - based subtraction .",
    "variation of the mean , local background level over the science - grade @xmath39-band image was found to be roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the width of the background noise distribution . as such it will have a negligible effect on the recovered magnitudes . the 27.395 mag arcsec@xmath42 level for our detection and analysis threshold",
    "was chosen to be similar to that used in extracting the on - line catalogue , which was set to 0.61 times the rms background noise . excluding the low signal - to - noise boundary region decreases the measured width of the background noise .",
    "thus , although 27.395 mag arcsec@xmath42 corresponds to 0.61 times the full field rms , it gives an effective limit of 0.91 times the rms of the interior region actually used for the study .",

    "a total of 125 had centroids in disagreement by more than 5 pixels ( 0.15@xmath41 ) .",

    "a pseudo - colour image was generated by combining the @xmath18- , @xmath39- and @xmath40-band wfc / acs observations . in each case , our segmentation image was viewed alongside the on - line one , as well as its colour and @xmath39-band counterparts .",
    "sextractor appeared to have erroneously deconvolved a single galaxy into multiple sections for 24 of the 50 largest galaxies in our catalogue .",
    "these were restored and 65 redundant sub - components deleted .",
    "sixty of the 125 objects with mis - matched centroids were also thought to have been poorly deblended .",
    "the most common problem ( 45 instances ) was under - deblending where an apparently close pair of galaxies displayed markedly different colours , suggesting a line - of - sight overlap at different redshifts rather than a single object or merger .",
    "the reverse was true for 9 galaxies with dual nuclei over - deblended .",
    "there were also 6 false detections caused by the diffraction spikes of bright stars .",
    "sextractor was rerun with four alternative minimum deblend contrast parameter settings ( 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 and 0.5 ) to fix these problems .",
    "the final sample of 2497 objects brighter than 28th magnitude will be refered to as iudf - bright .",
    "although the expected 10@xmath44 limiting magnitude for point sources in the udf @xmath39-band image is 29.2 mag @xcite , we adopt the more conservative 28th magnitude cut - off to ensure a reasonable completeness and reliability in the detection of extended sources ( see section 3.1 ) . an initial round of star - galaxy separation was performed at this stage using sextractor s ` stellaricity ' index  a value between 0 ( galaxy ) and 1 ( star ) assigned by an artificial neural network routine for classifying objects .",

    "we also confirm another 5 over - exposed stars through a visual inspection of objects brighter than 22nd mag with indices greater than 0.8 . beyond 27th mag , where there are numerous cases of intermediate stellaricity , we rely upon our photometric redshifts to establish object type .",

    "this parameter was calculated using a fortran program that iteratively refines the size of a test elliptical aperture and sums the enclosed light .",

    "flux contamination from nearby objects was avoided by excluding pixels attributed to other sources in the segmentation image .",

    "these differences lead to large disagreements in the redshifts derived for many of the iudf - bright galaxies .",
    "the m05 catalogue consists of 7250 @xmath40-band selected objects of which 2385 have counterparts in iudf - bright ( 2497 in total ) , and 73 are identified as having star - like seds ( leaving 2312 galaxies ) .",

    "it is encouraging , at least , that both detect an overdensity corresponding to the wall identified in the wider cdfs at @xmath54 by @xcite in their spectroscopic survey .",
    "however , @xcite note that they do not find the @xmath55 wall identified in the same survey ( while m05 appears to ) , although the ability of the photometric technique to resolve such close features is questionable .",
    "the disagreement between the two catalogues concerning the redshifts of other regions of overdensity is worrying .",
    "it appears to result mainly from the differences in sed template libraries used since the majority of galaxies in these features are matched in c06 by their bluest starburst templates .",
    "the galaxies in these disputed features are also extremely faint and lack spectroscopic redshifts , so it is impossible to evaluate the merits of each catalogue in this regard .",
    "hence , we duplicate all analyses using both catalogues in parallel and later investigate the effect of their disagreement on our final results .",

    "+ the six outliers in the m05 comparison serve as case studies of situations in which the photometric redshift technique can break down entirely . in most instances",
    "the problem ultimately stems from incorrect aperture magnitudes .",
    "for example , two spectroscopically confirmed stars ( @xmath61 ) were mis - classified as galaxies at @xmath62 and 0.510 respectively because they saturated in one or more of the acs filters , thereby corrupting their flux measurements .",
    "( we note that these objects would not have been included in our galaxy sample anyway as they were previously identified as stars based on their high sextractor stellaricity indices . )",

    ", we confirm the evolution in mean surface brightness of the bright galaxy population observed in these previous studies , and demonstrate that it holds down to @xmath161 mag .",
    "+ it should be noted that our comparison to the @xcite and @xcite results is imperfect because they specifically measured evolution of disc dominated systems , whereas we examine the galaxy population as a whole . as the udf and mgc are both field galaxy surveys one would expect a majority of late - type systems .",
    "in fact , eyeball classification of the mgc sample within the selection boundaries defined by @xcite found @xmath734 per cent early - type systems .",
    "our decision not to attempt a morphological subdivision of our sample meant we were able to avoid the added complications of choosing the most meaningful and robust criteria on which to classify galaxies at vastly different redshifts and from different datasets . however , this is somewhat of a limitation on our ability to use these results to distinguish between galaxy formation scenarios , which generally offer predictions for the evolution of specific morphological classes . in a future paper",
    "we will present a detailed structural analysis of the 169 objects in our @xmath162 volume - limited sample , quantify evolution by galaxy type , and compare our findings to theoretical expectations .",
    "we constructed the iudf - bright sample from all galaxies detected in the udf acs @xmath39-band image brighter than 28.0 mag .",
    "half light radii were measured for these objects and photometric redshifts matched to each from the mobasher catalogue .",
    "individual k - corrections were computed using sed template fits to their observed @xmath3 , @xmath18 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath163-band fluxes .",
    "this allowed the derivation of rest - frame , @xmath3-band absolute magnitudes and scale sizes using a @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 cosmological model .",
    "detailed artificial galaxy simulations were then used to establish detection completeness and measurement reliability limits in the observational apparent magnitude - size plane .",
    "we mapped these into the luminosity - size plane and presented the udf galaxy lsd for a series of volume limited samples . by comparison to the lsd of the millennium galaxy catalogue , a nearby galaxy survey with well defined selection limits , we identified a region of the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane over which the @xmath9 and @xmath2 galaxy populations can be compared free of selection biases .",
    "evolution was quantified via a 2d k - s test and an increase of @xmath71.0 mag found for the average surface brightness of galaxies with luminosities @xmath5 to @xmath6 mag .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of other recent studies , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but contradicts the null evolution findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ an important result to emerge from our artificial galaxy simulations was that surface brightness dependent measurement errors are a significant source of potential bias in the observed lsd .",
    "we found that , although exponential profile galaxies were detectable with a completeness of 75 per cent down to @xmath728 mag arcsec@xmath8 in the udf @xmath39-band image , flux and scale sizes could only be recovered to within 25 per cent accuracy down to @xmath727 mag arcsec@xmath8 ( based on sextractor kron magnitudes and sizes ) .",
    "as our error vector diagram indicates ( see fig .",
    "[ vectors_exp ] ) , the impact of these measurement errors is to _ recover extended , low surface brightness galaxies as faint , compact objects_. if this effect is not accounted for the observed lsd will be be doubly biased  with an under representation of large , diffuse systems and an over abundance of small ones .",
    "this problem of recoverability is only likely to get worse towards higher @xmath40 and must now be included in all analyses .",
    "we would like to thank bahram mobasher of the space telescope science institute for kindly making available his photometric redshift catalogue for this work .",
    "we also thank alister graham of mount stromlo observatory for helpful critcism and advice , and proof reading of this paper .",
