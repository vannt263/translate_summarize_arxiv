    "in this contribution we discuss the results recently obtained in  @xcite where azimuthal angle correlations in mueller  navelet jets  @xcite and forward jets at hera using the balitsky  fadin  kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) equation in the next  to  leading ( nlo ) approximation  @xcite were investigated ( related works can be found in  @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we focus on normalized differential cross sections for mueller  navelet jets , which are quite insensitive to parton distribution functions .",
    "this justifies the use of partonic cross sections which can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the transverse momenta of the tagged jets , and y their relative rapidity .",
    "the green s function carries the bulk of the y dependence and is the solution to the nlo bfkl equation , @xmath3 which acts on the basis including the azimuthal angle , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 as y increases the azimuthal dependence is mainly driven by the kernel and therefore we use lo jet vertices which are simpler than the nlo ones  @xcite . the differential cross section in the azimuthal angle @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the angles of the two tagged jets , reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 and the nlo kernel can be written as @xmath9 the eigenvalue of the lo kernel is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the logarithmic derivative of the euler function .",
    "the action of @xmath12 , in @xmath13 scheme , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the full cross section only depends on the @xmath14 component , @xmath15 the average of the cosine of the azimuthal angle times an integer projects out the contribution from each of these angular components : @xmath16 the normalized differential cross section is @xmath17 the bfkl resummation is not stable at nlo for zero conformal spin .",
    "a manifestation of this lack of convergence is what we found in the gluon ",
    "bremsstrahlung scheme where our nlo distributions have an unphysical behavior whenever the @xmath14 conformal spin appears in the calculation . to solve this problem we imposed compatibility with renormalization group evolution in the dis limit following  @xcite for all conformal spins .",
    "the new kernel with improvements to all orders reads  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are collinear coefficients  @xcite . after this collinear resummation",
    "our observables have a good physical behavior and are independent of the renormalization scheme .",
    "it is very important to remark that the asymptotic behavior of the bfkl resummation is convergent for non zero conformal spins . in this sense",
    "the ideal distributions to investigate experimentally are those of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 , we will see that in this case the difference between the lo and higher orders results is small .",

    "lo bfkl predictions were first obtained in  @xcite and failed to describe the data estimating too much decorrelation .",
    "an exact fixed nlo analysis using jetrad underestimated the decorrelation , while herwig was in agreement with the data .     and bottom : @xmath25 , at a @xmath26 collider with @xmath27 = 1.8 tev for bfkl at lo ( solid ) and nlo ( dashed ) .",

    "s cuts , where the transverse momentum for one jet is 20 gev and for the other 50 gev , the nlo calculation is instable under renormalization scheme changes .",
    "the convergence of our observables is poor whenever the coefficient associated to zero conformal spin , @xmath29 , is involved .",
    "if we eliminate this coefficient by calculating the ratios defined in eq .",

    "in this section we apply the bfkl formalism to predict the decorrelation in azimuthal angle between the electron and a forward jet associated to the proton in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "when the separation in rapidity space between the scattered electron and the forward jet is large and the transverse momentum of the jet is similar to the virtuality of the photon resolving the hadron , then the dominant terms are of bfkl type .",
    "this process is similar to that of mueller  navelet jets , the only difference being the substitution of one jet vertex by the electron vertex describing the coupling of the electron to the bfkl gluon green s function via a quark ",
    "antiquark pair .",
    "azimuthal angles in forward jets were studied at lo in  @xcite .",
    "we improved their calculation by considering the nlo bfkl kernel .    in the production of a forward jet in dis",
    "it is necessary to extract a parton with a large longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath32 from the proton .",
    "when the jet is characterized by a hard scale it is possible to use conventional collinear factorization to describe the process and the jet production rate may be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting the partonic cross section , and the effective parton density  @xcite being @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all quark flavors , and @xmath36 stands for the factorization scale .",
    "the final expression for the cross section at hadronic level is of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 where the index in the integral sign refers to the cuts @xmath39 the integration over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath32 of the forward jet involves a delta function fixing the rapidity @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a complicated function which can be found in  @xcite .    since the structure of the electron vertex singles out the components with conformal spin 0 and 2 , the number of observables related to the azimuthal angle dependence is limited when compared to the mueller  navelet case .",
    "the most relevant observable is the dependence of the average @xmath42 with the rapidity difference between the forward jet and outgoing lepton .",
    "it is natural to expect that the forward jet will be more decorrelated from the leptonic system as the rapidity difference is larger since the phase space for further gluon emission opens up .",
    "this is indeed what we observe in our numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hera1 ] .",
    "we find similar results to the mueller  navelet jets case where the most reliable calculation is that with a collinearly  improved kernel .",
    "the main effect of the higher order corrections is to increase the azimuthal angle correlation for a given rapidity difference , while keeping the decrease of the correlation as @xmath43 grows ."
