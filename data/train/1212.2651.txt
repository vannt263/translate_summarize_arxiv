    "an increasing number of spectroscopic and photometric observational studies have provided strong evidence for a widespread presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters .",
    "the observed star - to - star variations of light elements , such as na , o , al , and mg , indicates that a significant fraction ( 50 - 80% ) of globular cluster stars must have formed out of matter processed through a high - temperature cno cycle in a first generation of stars ( hereafter fg ; see e.g. carretta et al .",

    "photometric studies , by revealing the presence of multiple main sequences , subgiant , and red - giant branches in numerous clusters , have buttressed the spectroscopic evidence and added important new elements to the observational framework of multiple population in globular clusters .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "understanding the dynamics of the spatial mixing , and specifically the extent to which memory of the initial sg segregation predicted by the formation models is retained after one hubble time of relaxation - driven evolution , is an essential step to properly interpreting observational data , as well as testing the key elements of theoretical scenarios of cluster formation and evolution .    in this paper , by means of n - body simulations , we explore the structural evolution of multiple population clusters .",
    "we focus our attention on the spatial mixing of the sg and the fg populations , and the evolution of the relative spatial distribution of the sg and the fg stars .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the initial conditions of our n - body simulations ; in section 3 we present our results ; and in section 4 we discuss our results and summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the study presented in this paper is based on n - body simulations run with the starlab package ( portegies zwart et al . 2001 ) and accelerated by grape-6 special purpose hardware ( makino et al .",
    "2003 ) and gpu ( gaburov et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we explore the evolution of four systems with different degrees of initial concentration of the sg population . in all cases",
    "the initial conditions are set by simply combining two single - mass king ( 1966 ) models : the fg cluster is modeled as a king model with dimensionless central potential @xmath5 ; the sg system is also modeled as a king model with @xmath5 , but it is initially entirely contained within the inner regions of the fg system .",
    "our models have an initial ratio of the fg to the sg half - mass radius , @xmath6 equal to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the 3d half - mass radii ) .",
    "hereafter we refer to these simulations as , , , and .",
    "the models presented do not include primordial binaries or stellar evolution .",
    "the combined system is initially scaled to a virial ratio @xmath11 and is allowed to dynamically settle into an equilibrium state during the first few dynamical times of each simulation .",
    "all simulations start with a total number of particles @xmath12 ; initially the numbers of fg and sg particles are equal .",
    "we assume that the cluster is tidally truncated and therefore that the king truncation radius is equal to the cluster jacobi radius , @xmath13 .",
    "particles are removed from the simulation after reaching a radius equal to twice the jacobi radius . as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the initial conditions adopted for our simulations refer to the possible structural properties of a multiple - population cluster after the early loss of fg stars .    to explore the role of the relaxation - driven evaporation of stars on the cluster structural and mixing properties , we also include a simulation with the same initial conditions as those of the system , but without a tidal field or tidal truncation , and in which stars were removed only after reaching a distance of about 1000 times the cluster half - mass radius .",
    "hereafter we refer to this simulation as .",
    "all simulations were run until the total mass of the system was 20 percent or less of its initial value . for the system ,",
    "mass loss proceeds at a much slower rate and the simulation was stopped after the system had lost 20 percent of its initial mass . in order to explore the dependence of our results on the number of particles , two additional simulations with @xmath14 and @xmath15 particles were also run , with initial structural properties identical to those of the system .",
    "we start the presentation of our results by focussing our attention on the dynamics of the spatial mixing process .",
    "we emphasize here that the simulations presented in this paper are aimed at understanding the fundamental aspects of the dynamics of multiple - population clusters ; additional simulations currently in progress , including a spectrum of masses will allow us to more closely compare our theoretical results with observations .",
    "the panels of fig.[fig : lagrfig ] show the time evolution of the lagrangian radii of the fg and sg populations ( along with those of the entire system ) , and illustrate the system s structural evolution and degree of spatial mixing .",
    "overlap of all lagrangian radii for the two populations indicates complete mixing . as indicated in fig.[fig : lagrfig ] , the number of initial half - mass relaxation times ( of the whole system or of the sg subsystem ) needed to reach complete mixing of the two populations depends strongly on the initial concentration of the sg subsystem .    to illustrate the dynamics behind the mixing process and the role of relaxation - driven mass loss , fig .",
    "[ fig : rhr25 ] compares the time evolution of the ratio of the fg to the sg half - mass radii , @xmath16 , a convenient measure of global mixing , for the and the runs .",
    "initially , the ratio decreases relatively rapidly , as two - body relaxation acts to erase the initial spatial differences between the two populations .",
    "however , its rate of change slows as the system evolves .",
    "the reason for this is that , after reaching core collapse ( at @xmath17 for both the and the systems ) , the system enters its post - core collapse expansion phase . if the cluster did not lose a significant amount of mass during the expansion , its relaxation time would increase , with the half - mass radius and half - mass relaxation time growing with time as @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see e.g. spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "we note that the same behavior , with the same implications for the mixing process , is expected no matter what mechanism ( e.g. three - body binaries , primordial binaries , stellar evolution mass loss ) drives the cluster expansion .",
    "( see e.g. gieles et al .",
    "2011 for a recent discussion of the role of mass loss due to stellar evolution in providing the energy needed to balance the energy flow from the cluster half - mass radius . )",
    "the increasing relaxation time means that the evolution of any cluster property driven by two - body relaxation slows down accordingly .",
    "if we define the cluster dynamical age as @xmath20 and assume @xmath21 , it follows that , during this phase , @xmath22 and the rate of the cluster dynamical aging slows down as @xmath23 . the decreasing rate of spatial mixing of the fg and sg populations evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhr25 ] is a manifestation of the decreasing cluster aging rate .    in reality , clusters lose mass , and the time evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 deviate from the expressions derived on the assumption of zero mass loss . while the spatial mixing rate decreases with time for both the and the systems , fig .",
    "[ fig : rhr25 ] shows that the evolution of @xmath16 for the system is significantly slower than for the system .",
    "this difference is due to the different mass loss rates of the two systems . as the amount of mass lost increases , the growth of the cluster relaxation time gradually slows , and eventually it starts to decrease , both as a result of the decreasing remaining mass and of the eventual contraction of the half - mass radius .",
    "as the cluster mass decreases so does its jacobi radius , and the outer , less relaxed ( and less mixed ) , layers are gradually stripped away .",
    "thus , by enhancing the loss of less - mixed layers and slowing the growth of the cluster relaxation time , mass loss accelerates the cluster dynamical aging process and the evolution toward complete spatial mixing .",
    "we further illustrate these points in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] . here",
    "we focus on the local relaxation time @xmath26 , which provides a more accurate measure of the level of mixing expected at different distances from the cluster center . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the cluster 1-d velocity dispersion , @xmath28 the cluster mass density and @xmath0 is the total number of stars .",
    "[ fig : tau ] shows the time evolution of the local cluster dynamical age @xmath29 at different distances from the cluster center .",
    "the slowdown in the time evolution of @xmath25 when the cluster expansion starts ( marked by the vertical dotted line ) and the differences between the dynamical aging of the and the systems are evident in this figure .",
    "[ fig : tau ] also shows the radial dependence of the cluster dynamical age : as expected , @xmath30 decreases at larger distances from the cluster center , and the cluster outer regions mix on longer time scales than the inner regions .",
    "the implications of this radial variation of the dynamical age on the mixing process , and its imprint on the radial variation of the fraction of sg stars , are discussed in more detail in section [ sec : radial ] .    the general evolution toward spatial mixing is therefore driven by internal two - body relaxation and accelerated by mass loss",
    ". the mass loss rate due to two - body relaxation is determined primarily by the strength of the external tidal field ( see e.g. vesperini & heggie 1997 , baumgardt & makino 2003 , gieles & baumgardt 2008 ) , while the local internal relaxation rate is determined by the cluster structural properties and their radial variation within the cluster .",
    "the different processes ( and time scales ) involved in the mixing dynamics imply that , in general , it is not possible to determine a universal mixing time scale simply in terms of the cluster initial half - mass relaxation time scale .",
    "the and systems share the same initial structure but , after a given number of initial half - mass relaxation time scales , because of their different mass loss history , they have reached a significantly different degree of mixing .",
    "we have carried out a set of four simulations with different sg initial spatial concentrations . in comparing the evolution of these systems ,",
    "we assume they represent clusters with the same initial masses and tidal radii ( equal to the jacobi radius ) , but different internal structures determined by the concentration of the sg population .    as shown in numerous investigations based on fokker - planck and n - body simulations ( see e.g. chernoff & weinberg 1990 , vesperini & heggie 1997 , baumgardt & makino 2003 , gieles & baumgardt 2008 ) , systems with the same tidal radius and mass share a similar relaxation - driven dissolution time scale , with only a weak dependence on the internal structure of the cluster ( see e.g. gieles & baumgardt 2008 ) .",
    "the four systems investigated here span almost an order of magnitude in initial half - mass relaxation time , but only a factor of two in the half - mass lifetime ( defined as the time needed to lose half of their initial mass due to the effects of two - body relaxation ) .",
    "the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhrall ] show the evolution of @xmath16 as a function of time normalized to each cluster s half - mass time scale , @xmath31 , and as a function of the cluster total mass ( normalized to its initial value ) .    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhrall ] shows @xmath16 as a function of time normalized to a common reference time , @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the definition of @xmath32 follows from studies showing that this functional form provides a good fit to the scaling of the relaxation - driven tidal dissolution ( or half - mass ) time scale with initial cluster properties .",
    "the exact value of the numerical factor needed for @xmath32 to match half - mass time scale depends on the cluster mass spectrum and the cluster structure ( see e.g. gieles & baumgardt 2008 for a discussion on the dependence on the latter ) .",
    "note that @xmath32 is closely related to the dynamical family parameter introduced by chernoff & weinberg 1990 ( see their table 3 ) .",
    "as just discussed , both internal two - body relaxation and ( indirectly ) mass loss drive the evolution of the fg - sg mixing . despite the initial differences in the sg concentration , all systems approach a state of complete mixing ( @xmath35 ) after approximately the same number of @xmath31 and @xmath32 time scales , and after losing 6070 percent of their mass .",
    "[ fig : ndepend ] compares the evolution of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath36 for clusters with the structure of the @xmath37 system but different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath16 shows only a very weak dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "while , as pointed out at the beginning of this section , the goal of the simulations presented in this paper is to understand the fundamental aspects of multiple - population cluster dynamics and not to directly compare the results of simulations with observations , we nonetheless think it is important to identify those parameters that can be most easily measured for real clusters and might be correlated with the degree of sg / fg mixing .",
    "one observable quantity that can be reliably estimated for all clusters is the current half - mass relaxation time , @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhrall2 ] we show the evolution of the degree of mixing ( as measured by @xmath16 ) versus the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "this figure suggests that @xmath38 may be a good observational indicator of the extent to which a cluster still retains memory of the initial sg segregation .",
    "it is important to recognize from fig .",
    "[ fig : rhrall2 ] that , when interpreting cluster - to - cluster differences in the current sg ",
    "fg mixing state , one must also consider possible differences in the initial degree of sg concentration .",
    "for example , two clusters starting with initial conditions similar to our and simulations might be characterized by different relative sg ",
    "fg spatial distributions even if observed at the same dynamical phase and after having lost the same amount of mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rhrall ] ) .",
    "observations of clusters thought to be at the same dynamical phase may thus shed light on the extent of the differences in the initial structural properties and concentration of the sg subsystem .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lagrfig ] , the fg  sg mixing process occurs more efficiently and on a shorter time scale in the cluster inner regions , where the local two - body relaxation time scale is shorter . in this section",
    "we explore further the evolution of the radial dependence of the mixing process .",
    "[ fig : nrprofile ] shows the radial profiles of the number ratio of sg to fg stars @xmath1 for the system at different stages of its evolution ( the evolution of the radial profile shown in this figure is representative of the other systems investigated ) .",
    "the system starts with the sg population concentrated in the innermost regions ; as the cluster evolves and the fg and sg stars mix , the inner flat portion of the @xmath1 profiles progressively extends toward the outer regions .",
    "complete mixing corresponds to a flat profile extending over the entire cluster .    during the evolution",
    "the @xmath1 radial profile is characterized by an approximately flat inner region followed by a declining outer portion corresponding to regions increasingly dominated by fg stars . in the outer regions ,",
    "the @xmath1 profile is characterized again by an approximately flat portion followed , in some cases , by a weak final rise in the profile in the cluster outermost regions .    as our simulations show , during a large fraction of a cluster evolution , the sg and the fg populations are not completely mixed and @xmath1 varies with the distance from the cluster center .",
    "this fact has several implications : first , some memory of the initial sg segregation predicted by dercole et al . ( 2008 ) should still be preserved and observable in many clusters today .",
    "second , the observational determination of the sg - to - fg number ratio at a given distance from the center of a cluster will , in general , differ from the global value of that quantity [ hereafter we will refer to the global value of @xmath1 as @xmath2 ] .",
    "third , when exploring cluster - to - cluster differences in the sg - to - fg number ratio , we must take into account the possibility that part of these differerences might arise if observations cover different radial zones of different clusters , relative to the half - mass radius .    the global sg - to - fg number ratio and its cluster - to - cluster variation are key ingredients of , and constraints on , our ability to understand and model the formation and evolution of multiple populations in globular clusters .",
    "it is therefore important to properly understand the relationship between the observational estimates of the sg - to - fg number ratio and its actual global value .",
    "[ fig : rglob ] shows the time evolution of the radius , @xmath41 , at which the local value of @xmath1 equals the global value @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath41 is shown only until @xmath42 since , beyond this time , as the system approaches complete mixing @xmath41 becomes very noisy and not well defined .",
    "[ fig : rglob ] shows that @xmath1 generally equals @xmath2 at radii @xmath43 .",
    "these results provide a first approximate indication of the range of radial distances to be targeted in observational studies in order to estimate the global sg - to - fg number ratio from observations covering only a limited radial range .",
    "additional simulations with a spectrum of masses are currently underway , and will allow a refined estimate of @xmath41 and more direct comparisons with observations .      as shown by dercole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the transition from a cluster initially dominated by fg stars to one with similar numbers of sg and fg stars ( or even dominated by sg stars ) occurs mainly during the cluster s early evolution .",
    "this transition is due to the loss of fg stars during the cluster s early expansion triggered by the loss of snii ejecta .    during the subsequent long - term evolution , mass loss due to two - body relaxation",
    "removes both fg and sg stars from the cluster .",
    "until the two populations are completely mixed , two - body relaxation will still lead to a slight preferential loss of fg stars and further increase the sg - to - fg number ratio ( although this increase is much smaller than that during the cluster early evolution ; see dercole et al .",
    "[ fig : nsgevol ] shows the time evolution of the global sg - to - fg number ratio , @xmath2 . for the systems studied here , during the long - term evolution @xmath2 increases by only a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "if stars with chemical properties typical of observed sg populations can form only in globular clusters , the sg stars observed in the galactic halo ( see e.g. martell & grebel 2010 , carretta et al .",
    "2010b ) must have been lost by clusters mainly during the long - term evolution phase explored in this paper . as discussed by vesperini et al .",
    "( 2010 ; see also carretta et al .",
    "2010b , schaerer & charbonnel 2011 ) , the fraction of sg stars in the galactic halo is a very important quantity that can shed light on the connection between globular clusters , their formation and dynamical history , and their contribution to the assembly of the galactic halo .",
    "our previous study of the formation and evolution of multiple populations ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) showed that sg stars form in the innermost regions of a cluster initially dominated by fg stars . following the early cluster expansion triggered by mass loss due to snii , a large fraction of fg stars",
    "escape the cluster , leaving a system with comparable numbers of fg and sg stars , with the sg stars strongly segregated near the cluster center .",
    "the simulations presented here follow the subsequent long - term evolution of these clusters , driven by two - body relaxation . by means of a survey of n - body simulations ,",
    "we have investigated the dynamical evolution of multiple - population clusters , focusing our attention on cluster structural evolution and the fg - sg mixing process .",
    "we have studied initial conditions characterized by different degrees of the initial concentration of the sg subsystem .",
    "two - body relaxation is the key process driving the mixing of the two populations .",
    "as the local two - body relaxation time scale increases in the cluster outer regions , this process becomes less efficient at larger distances from the cluster center .",
    "moreover , as soon as an energy source in the cluster core causes a cluster to start expanding , the cluster relaxation time increases with time and the rate of its dynamical aging increasingly slows down . a significant slowdown in the evolution toward complete mixing ensues ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : rhr25 ] and [ fig : tau ] ) .",
    "our simulations show that as cluster evolution continues , relaxation - driven mass loss affects the mixing process by slowing and eventually reverting the growth of the cluster relaxation time , and by causing the loss of the cluster s outer unmixed layers . by comparing the evolution of clusters with the same initial structure but different mass - loss rates ,",
    "we have quantified this process and illustrated the joint role of internal relaxation and tidal mass loss in the evolution toward complete mixing .",
    "our simulations imply that , unless a cluster has lost a significant fraction of its mass ( @xmath45 ; as discussed in the paper , we refer here to the mass lost during the cluster long - term evolution , and not to the early loss of fg stars ) , fg - sg mixing will not be complete and the sg stars will be centrally concentrated relative to the fg population ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rhrall ] ) .    to further explore the radial dependence of the mixing process",
    ", we have followed the time evolution of the radial profile of the sg - to - fg number ratio , @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nrprofile ] ) . we have shown that as sg  fg mixing proceeds , the @xmath1 profile can be divided into three different regions : ( 1 ) an inner region where @xmath1 is flat ; ( 2 ) an intermediate region where the fg is increasingly dominant , with @xmath1 declining with increasing radius ; ( 3 ) an outer region where the @xmath1 profile flattens ( the outermost cluster regions are in some cases characterized by a slightly rising @xmath1 profile ) .    since , as discussed above , reaching complete mixing ( and therefore a flat @xmath1 radial profile ) requires the cluster to be in an advanced phase of dynamical evolution , with the loss of a significant fraction of stars , we expect that a @xmath1 profile characterized by the regions described above will be found in all clusters which have not undergone strong relaxation - driven mass loss ",
    "possibly a large fraction of the galactic globular cluster population .",
    "although a detailed and quantitative comparison with observations is beyond the scope of the analysis carried out in this paper , our study provides a preliminary indication of the link between the level of sg / fg mixing and parameters that can be determined observationally for real clusters . specifically , we have illustrated the relation between sg / fg mixing and the ratio @xmath38 ( see fig.[fig : rhrall2 ] ) .",
