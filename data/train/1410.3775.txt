    "light beams propagating in optically uniaxial crystals , with two principal dielectric indexes , exhibit birefringence or double refraction , _",
    "i.e. _ decomposition of an input beam into ordinary ( o ) and extraordinary ( e ) beams with orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "the extraordinary beam is laterally shifted with respect to the ordinary one , being this shift equal to zero when the input beam propagates along the optic axis .",
    "the intensity distribution between the o- and e- beams , expressed by the malus law , depends only on one parameter : the relative orientation of the crystal with respect to the polarization plane of the input beam .",
    "biaxial crystals ( bcs ) , with three different principal dielectric indexes and two optic axes , also exhibit double refraction .",
    "nevertheless , propagation of light beams along the optic axis is substantially different from the uniaxial case .",
    "hamilton predicted that , in this case , the beam should propagate conically inside the crystal and emerge as a hollow cylinder yielding an annular transverse intensity pattern or light ring of internal conical refraction ( cr ) @xcite . simultaneously to this prediction , hamilton also demonstrated that an infinity of wave - vectors distributed on a hollow cone entering in the a biaxial crystal along the biradial propagate with common poynting vector along the latter one , the so - called external conical refraction . soon afterwards",
    "hamilton s prediction , lloyd reported the first experimental observation of both internal and external cr @xcite and since then few experimental works have further studied cr experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , internal cr has been applied to the laser technique @xcite , for optical micromanipulation @xcite and for free space optical communications @xcite .",
    "firsts theoretical efforts to describe precisely the internal conical refraction phenomenon were started by portigal and burstein @xcite .",
    "the complete calculation according to fourier analysis was performed by lalor @xcite and by schell and bloembergen @xcite and later on rewritten by belsky and khapalyuk @xcite , belsky and stepanov @xcite and berry and jeffrey @xcite . from the experimental point of view , the full validation of the internal cr was given by fve and coworkers @xcite .",
    "however , a simple analytical formulation capable of predicting the transverse intensity pattern at the lloyd ( focal ) plane after a light beam propagates along or near the optic axis of a biaxial crystal ( or a cascade of bcs @xcite ) is still lacking .    in this article",
    ", we experimentally address this last need by analyzing the wave - vector and polarization dependence of the internal cr phenomenon . in the following",
    "we will refer to internal cr simply as cr .",
    "our experimental scheme is based on the propagation of elliptical beams ( ebs ) along the optic axis of a bc .",
    "ebs do not possesses continuous cylindrical symmetry , at variance with gaussian beams typically used in conical refraction experiments . in section 2",
    ", we demonstrate that ebs do not produce the otherwise expected transverse annular intensity pattern when they propagate through the bc , but split into two refracted beams with orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "simple phenomenological expressions for the position and the intensity of the refracted beams are derived in section 3 .",
    "worth noticing , we show that the position of the refracted beams is defined not only by the crystal orientation , but also by the input beam properties , in particular , by the orientation of the preselected plane of input wave - vectors . additionally , we demonstrate that the intensity distribution between the two refracted beams can be well described with a single angular parameter . when the biaxial crystal is rotated , the intensity distribution between the two refracted beams follows the transformation law recently pointed out by loiko  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for cr filtered beams , that differs from the well known malus law for double refraction in uniaxial crystals . to verify the usefulness of the phenomenological transformation rules",
    ", we apply them in section 4 to calculate the resulting intensity pattern for an incident axicon beam and confirm our approach with experimental results .",
    "section 5 summarizes the main results and conclusions of the work .",
    "conical refraction has been reported only for input beams with intensity pattern possessing continuous cylindrical ( rotation ) symmetry around the propagation axis , see fig .  [ fig1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "this has been motivated by hamilton s prediction of the cr within the ray optics description , where rays are always associated with cylindrically symmetric collimated beams .",
    "real beams of finite size can be modeled as a bundle of rays with propagation directions isotropically distributed around the beam axis . on the one hand , according to the modified hamilton theory @xcite , cr can be interpreted as a wave - vector and polarization dependent type of double refraction , when each ray of the input bundle refracts into two rays at the entrance crystal surface and all refracted rays form a cone . in this process ,",
    "the two refracted rays go to opposite points on the cr ring .",
    "on the other hand , it has been also demonstrated that in cr the transverse wave - vector components are conserved @xcite .",
    "this means that all input rays ( plane waves ) with wave - vectors confined in a certain plane defined by an azimuthal angle @xmath0 refract to a plane with the same azimuthal angle at the lloyd plane , _",
    "i.e. _ into two opposite points on the cr ring .",
    "therefore , double refraction along the optic axis of a bc and , in particular , the wave - vector and polarization dependence of the cr , can be studied with linearly polarized beams composed from plane waves whose wave - vectors are confined in a certain plane .",
    "such beams are known as cylindrical beams and elliptical beams ( ebs ) provide their finite size approximation .",
    "the latter ones can be obtained from collimated gaussian beams focused by a cylindrical lens .",
    "indeed , we have observed that an eb passing through the bc does not generate the cr ring , but splits into two beams ( in case of circularly polarized input beams ) oppositely placed along the otherwise expected cr ring and tangent to it , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) . the form and orientation of the refracted beams resemble the transverse intensity pattern and orientation of the input eb .",
    "below , using ebs we will obtain phenomenological laws that describe double refraction along the optic axis in biaxial crystals .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the position and the relative intensity of the two refracted beams produced when an input eb propagates along the optic axis of a bc .",
    "the experimental set - up shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is used . the initial circularly polarized gaussian beam with waist radius of @xmath1",
    "is obtained from a @xmath2 diode laser coupled to a monomode fiber .",
    "then a linear polarizer is introduced to fix the polarization plane in a well defined direction .",
    "the resulting linearly polarized beam is focused by a cylindrical lens of @xmath3 focal length with its flat face oriented strictly perpendicular to the beam propagation direction .",
    "the cylindrical lens only focuses the gaussian beam in one direction , so that it transforms its transverse circular shape to an elliptical one with a ratio 3/100 of the semi - axes of the ellipse . as a consequence ,",
    "the divergence of the generated eb is different along the focused and unfocused directions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where _ f _ and _ uf _ subscripts refer to _ focused _ and _ unfocused _ directions , respectively ) .",
    "the eb is characterized by its polarization plane , represented by the azimuthal angle @xmath8 , and by its plane of wave - vectors ( or @xmath9-plane ) , represented by azimuthal angle @xmath10 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "different ebs are obtained by rotating either the cylindrical lens or the linear polarizer .",
    "the bc is @xmath11 long and it was cut from a monoclinic centrosymmetric kgd(wo@xmath12)@xmath13 crystal .",
    "its polished entrance surfaces ( cross - section @xmath14 , parallelism 10 arc seconds ) are perpendicular to one of the optic axes ( misalignment angle @xmath15 ) and positioned strictly perpendicular to the beam propagation direction , so that the incoming beam to the bc passes along its optic axis .",
    "both the orientation of the optic axis of the bc and the cylindrical lens are well controlled in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions in 3d spherical coordinates by a micrometer positioning system .",
    "the resulting pattern is captured by a ccd camera at the lloyd ( focal ) plane behind the bc @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly outline the cr annular pattern observed at the lloyd plane with an input gaussian beam . while the complete cr ring is observed for circular polarization of the input gaussian beam , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , a crescent ring with one point of the ring being of zero intensity appears for linear polarization . in both cases , the center of the cr ring is laterally shifted with respect to the incident beam .",
    "this shift can be represented by a vector @xmath18 that belongs to the plane of the crystal optic axes and is perpendicular to them @xcite .",
    "its modulus is equal to the ring radius @xmath19 ( in our set - up @xmath20 ) , given by a product of the length and the conical refraction semiangle of the bc ( @xmath21 for kgd(wo@xmath12)@xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "now we will experimentally deduce the lateral shift of the refracted beams for ebs propagated through a bc . in fig .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eqintensity ] ) constitute the transformation rules of conical refraction . for different polarization of the input beams they allow explaining the ratio of intensities for any pair of diagonally opposite points of the cr ring .",
