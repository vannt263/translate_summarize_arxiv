    "the question that how the properties of hadrons bounded in nuclear medium differ from that of free hadrons is an important and active research topic of experiment and theory .",
    "example of such medium modifications is the european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect in the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , which has been discussed extensively since early 1980s starting from the observation of a change in the structure function of a heavy nucleus relative to that of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "the nuclear effects in dis were further measured in the form of the ratio @xmath2 of two nuclei . from the studies of data on the ratio r(a / b )",
    "one can divide a few regions of characteristic nuclear effects @xcite : depletion of nuclear structure functions at small bjorken variable @xmath3 ( shadowing region ) ; a small enhancement of nuclear structure functions for @xmath4 ( anti - shadowing ) ; depletion with a minimum around @xmath5 ( known as emc effect ) followed by a rise at large @xmath6 ( fermi motion ) .    a quantitative understanding of the emc effect can help us to understand how the properties of hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium and even can provide valuable insights into the origin of nuclear force .",
    "in particular , the emc effect has been taken as fundamental basis in establishing the nuclear parton distributions , which often serve as the source of information about quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and color glass condensation ( cgc ) in heavy ion collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . for these sakes , a proper theory of the emc effect should explain not only the ratios of the structure functions but also the absolute values of the nuclear structure functions themselves .",
    "the complexity of the emc effect is due to the fact that the parton distributions of a bound nucleon are affected through both perturbative and nonperturbative ways .",
    "the parton recombination is generally thought as a source of the nuclear shadowing , which can be described in a perturbative framework .",
    "close , qiu and roberts described the nuclear shadowing using a perturbative qcd calculation of the gluon recombination function at a fixed @xmath7 scale in @xcite .",
    "this work is irrelevant to any dynamical equation and is less in the prediction power .",
    "mueller and qiu used the dglap equation with the glr - mq corrections discussed qualitatively the nuclear shadowing in @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we obtained the parton distribution functions of the proton , which are evaluated dynamically using the dglap equation with the zrs corrections @xcite from a low scale , where the nucleon consists valence quarks .",
    "the simple input distributions of the proton can describe the nonperturbative nuclear corrections .",
    "the above scheme allows us to dynamically and quantitatively research the emc effect . for this sake , in this paper we first generalize the zrs corrections to the deep inelastic scattering off a nuclear target in sec .",
    "we find that the nuclear shadowing effect is a dynamical result of the parton recombination due to multi - nucleon correlations in the nuclear target .",
    "then we add the contributions of a traditional fermi motion and the nucleon swelling on the nuclear input parton distributions in secs . 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "a series of the emc effect ratios are presented in sec . 5 , which are consistent with the present experimental data .",
    "we also calculate the anti - shadowing effect and point out that the so - called anti - shadowing effect is mainly due to the deformation of the valence quarks in a swelling nucleon rather than a compensation to the shadowing correction . in particularly ,",
    "the nuclear gluon distributions are dynamically predicted in figs . 6 and 7 , which are important information in studying high energy nuclear physics .",
    "the discussions and summary are given in the sec .",
    "the corrections of parton recombination to the qcd evolution of the parton distributions in proton have been studied with the zsr equation . in nuclear target ,",
    "the longitudinal localization size of a parton with small @xmath6 could exceed a nucleon size . in this case , the partons in different nucleons could interact and they contribute a factor @xmath8 in the following modified dglap equation with the zrs corrections @xcite .",
    "we define that @xmath9 ( j = u , d ) are valence quark distributions , @xmath10 ( i = u , d , s ) are sea quark distributions , @xmath11 ( i = u , d , s ) are anti - sea quark distributions and @xmath12 is gluon distribution , @xmath13 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath56 ; @xmath57 is the number of shadowed nucleons .",
    "the fitting parameter @xmath58 , instead of @xmath59 , is due to the anisotropic two - dimensions distribution of nucleons in a lorentz boost nucleus and the empty space among bound nucleons .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 1 ) dynamically produces the nuclear shadowing in quark- and gluon - distributions .",
    "generally , the emc effect at large @xmath6 is identified to the effect of the fermi motion inside nucleus .",
    "this effect was studied by bodek and ritchie @xcite and frankfult and strikman @xcite .",
    "the fermi motion smears the input quark distributions in a bound nucleon    @xmath60where    @xmath61 , \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] for @xmath62 ; otherwise @xmath63 here @xmath64 according to fermi gas model . the average effective mass of the bound nucleons is @xmath65 .",

    "it implies that the bound nucleon is nearly on shell , since the nucleon consists of three valence quarks at @xmath70-scale and hence without any extra component ( pion ) to balance the lost momentum in the off - mass shell effect . for detailed discussion",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    "after determining the dynamics of the emc effect at small and large @xmath6 regions , we focus on the emc effect at the intermediate @xmath6 region . we will choose a model from various present explanations about emc effect @xcite .",
    "the emc effect at @xmath71 was explained in the traditional nuclear physics such as the binding model and pion model .",
    "however , the former was argued that it can not explain the emc effect @xcite by itself and later was ruled out due to the limits set by drell - yan measurements @xcite .",
    "besides , the high - precision experimental data on light nuclei from jefferson lab @xcite suggests that the slope of @xmath72 in the @xmath73 region depends on the location of the struck quark within nucleus , i.e. , it is a local density effect .",
    "therefore , the emc effect can be described in terms of modifications to the internal partonic structure of the nucleon in the nuclear environment .",
    "one of such corrections is the swelling of bound nucleon @xcite .",
    "the presence of such structures within the bound nucleon could substantially increase the confinement radius .",
    "a natural result is deformation of the input parton distributions in a swelling nucleon according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "such swelling mechanism was first discussed in a constituent quark model by zhu and shen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the simple three quark input distributions in ref . @xcite",
    "allow us easily to determine the nuclear deformed inputs .",
    "particularly , the valence quark distributions in a proton and a bound nucleon in nucleus ( a ) at @xmath74 are written as    @xmath75    @xmath76 where the distributions in the proton are fixed in ref . @xcite as    @xmath77and    @xmath78    we define the dispersion of the input distributions as    @xmath79^{1/2}\\ ] ]    @xmath80^{1/2},\\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the @xmath82-th moment of the distributions .",
    "the dispersion @xmath83 decreases with the increased confinement scale of the initial valence quarks : @xmath84 , according to the uncertainty principle .",
    "for @xmath85 we have the following relation    @xmath86    the swelling of a bound nucleon arises from the nuclear force and relates to the local environment - the number of nucleons around it , since the nuclear force is a short distance interaction .",
    "thus the a - dependence of swelling should be determined by the local properties of nuclear matter , i.e. , the local nuclear density @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we adopt the following simple way to estimate the swelling coefficient for @xmath89    @xmath90\\delta_0+p_s(a)\\delta_0/4,\\eqno(8)\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the swelling coefficient for a nucleon in the nuclear center .",
    "the second term is for the fact that the swelling of a nucleon on the nuclear surface is less than that of one in the interior : @xmath92factor considers the average density of nucleon on the surface is about half of that in the nuclear kernel and the other @xmath93-factor is due to the space surround a nucleon on the nuclear surface , a half is vacuum and half is nuclear mater .",
    "@xmath94 is the probability of a struck nucleon locating on the nuclear surface , and it can be estimated in terms of the nuclear density    @xmath95,\\eqno(9)\\]]with @xmath96 nucleon/@xmath97 , @xmath98 fm , and @xmath99 .",
    "the surface thickness is given by @xmath100 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath101 according to this picture , scattering from a central or deeply bound constituent gives a larger emc effect than the scattering from a surface or weakly bound constituent .",
    "that is , the swelling effect is a local nuclear dynamical one .",
    "the free parameter @xmath102 is determined by the emc ratio of any nucleus , for example , @xmath103 .",
    "the emc effect is exhibited in the ratio of the dis structure function per nucleon bounded in a nucleus relative to that of deuterium @xmath104 . in this work",
    "the isospin asymmetry is neglected .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath105 to replace @xmath106 , and the related parameters for @xmath107 are listed in table 1 , where the @xmath108 is regarded as a parameter rather than the fermi momentum since the gas model is unavailable . the ratio @xmath109 is shown in fig . 1 .     at @xmath110gev@xmath111.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "there are four free parameters used in the determination of the proton parton distributions in our previous work @xcite . in this work",
    "we add two free parameters : the coefficient @xmath112 and @xmath102 to predict the nuclear parton distributions .",

    "it implies that we can not only predict the ratio of the structure functions , but also can give the absolute values of the nuclear structure functions themselves .",
    "these results are useful in the research of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the nuclear dependence of the ratios in light nuclei @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 in fig.3 presents that the emc effect in this range depends on the local nuclear environment rather than on the average density .",

    "we remove the contributions from bound nucleon swelling and fermi motion effects in the ratio @xmath128 .",
    "the remaining part in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) is the shadowing and anti - shadowing effect .",
    "we find that the anti - shadowing effect contributes only a small fraction for the ratio in @xmath129 because it distributes in a broad @xmath6 range .",

    "the swelling effect enhances the distributions in the region @xmath130 and results in part of `` anti - shadowing '' .",
    "this enhancement depends on the nuclear density ( through @xmath68 ) and , furthermore , does not disappear at large @xmath7 .     at @xmath115gev@xmath111",

    "( 1 ) , in which the input parameters are fixed by the proton structure functions and only a few extra free parameters are added for nucleus .",
    "one can expect that the uncertainty of nuclear gluon distributions in our work will be much reduced .     at @xmath137gev@xmath111 with the global models : eps09 @xcite , eks98 @xcite ( based on the leading - order ( lo ) global dglap analysis ) , hkn07 @xcite and nds @xcite ( next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) dglap analysis).,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    finally , we present the ratio @xmath138 with various values of @xmath7 in fig.8",

    "the main advantage of our explanation of the emc effect comparing with the other models is that the parton distributions in both proton and nucleus are evolved according to a unified dynamics - the dglap equation with the zrs corrections .",
    "the nuclear environment increases nonlinear effects and deforms the nonperturbative input quark distributions . in particular ,",
    "the nuclear shadowing is a natural result of the qcd evolution rather than the parameterized description as in most of the emc effect models . in consequence , the number of free parameters are much reduced in whole kinematic range .",
    "it implies that the prediction power of our approach for the nuclear parton distributions is enhanced .",
    "in summary , we obtain new explanation on the emc effect via the dglap equation with the zrs corrections and minimum number of free parameters , where the nuclear shadowing effect is a dynamical evolution result of the equation , while nucleon swelling and fermi motion in the nuclear environment deform the input parton distributions . in consequence , parton distributions of both proton and nucleus are predicted in a unified framework .",
