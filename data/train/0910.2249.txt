    "both theoretical models thus have a good range of possible solutions , but these estimates assume the efficiency relation @xmath124 of @xcite , which gives @xmath125 0.02 , about a factor of five smaller than that derived for this pulsar from its inferred luminosity . assuming our measured quantity @xmath117 = 0.10 the allowed range remains about the same for the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) model and the range of @xmath107 shifts to @xmath31 70    90   for the og model . the phase lag between the radio pulse and the first @xmath0-ray pulse",
    "is in agreement with both og and tpc or sg models . + for psr  j2229 + 6114 , the observed integrated energy flux is @xmath126erg@xmath7s@xmath8 .",
    "thus , we estimate a @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath127 = 2.6@xmath8810@xmath128(@xmath105/3  kpc)@xmath116 erg s@xmath8 , and deduce an efficiency @xmath129 = 0.011 @xmath111 ( @xmath105/3  kpc)@xmath116 , which is a factor 1.6 larger than the efficiency estimated by the relation @xmath124 .",
    "note that with the estimated snr distance of 0.8kpc the efficiency decreases to 0.001 @xmath111 , while with the distance derived from the dm ( 7.5kpc ) the efficiency increases to 0.07 @xmath111 , emphasizing the importance of the distance determination .    as for psr j1048@xmath25832 , we can compare light curves with the geometrical models of @xcite to derive constraints on the geometry . for",
    "outer magnetosphere models with @xmath130 ,  both tpc and og geometries can deliver single @xmath0-ray pulses at a range of angles .",
    "single pulse solutions appear for @xmath131 , @xmath132 for the tpc / sg geometry and over the range @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath121 0.47 - 1.08 for the og model . for psr j2229",
    "+ 6114 , we have an additional geometrical constraint from modeling of the x - ray pwn torus surrounding the pulsar , as measured by _",
    "chandra _ ; @xcite fit these data to determine a viewing angle @xmath135 .",
    "this is in the overlap range consistent with both the tpc and the og single pulse solutions .",
    "finally , although there is some uncertainty in determining the precise phase of the magnetic axis from the radio pulse , the lag of the strong @xmath0-ray peak from the radio peak ( @xmath136 ) provides additional information . examining the sample light curves in figures 9 & 10 of @xcite we find that single peaks at this phase are found only when they can be identified as the normal ` p2 ' component , with a ` bridge ' of emission to earlier phases and ` p1 ' faint or missing .",
    "such light curves appear only for small efficiency @xmath137 and only for a modest range of angles : @xmath138 , @xmath139 ( tpc / sg , with p1 faint ) or @xmath140 , @xmath141 ( og , with p1 absent ) .",
    "this is precisely the @xmath110 range required by the x - ray torus fitting ; including the small @xmath122 constraint from the detection of radio emission , we see that the radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray data are all consistent with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , implying @xmath144 for both models .",
    "thus low @xmath0-ray efficiency , high altitude emission and a well constrained viewing geometry together provide a consistent picture for gamma - ray light curve shape . on the other hand , the gamma - ray light curve does not seem to match the the clearly double - peaked x - ray light curve .",
    "however , we have argued that the gamma - ray light curve is intrinsically double - peaked , with the first peak missing or very weak , and the appearance of a possible first peak in the @xmath32 100 mev and 0.1 - 0.3 gamma - ray light curves ( signal/@xmath145 2.5@xmath85 ) that is around the phase of the first x - ray peak is intriguing .",
    "but the second gamma - ray peak is not in phase with the second x - ray peak .",
    "as the radiation mechanisms contributing to the emission in x - ray and lat wavebands may differ , and at a given magnetospheric colatitude , the anisotropy of each emission mechanism is both energy - dependent and altitude - dependent , one does not expect the pulse profiles to be achromatic .",
    "therefore , more detailed physical radiation models are required to understand the energy dependence of the lat light curve and to explain the lower energy x - ray light curve . + this evidence against low altitude emission in these pulsars can also be supplemented by constraints of a separate physical origin .",
    "the observation of photons out to beyond 5 gev precludes any dominant action of magnetic pair creation @xmath146 in the emission region at energies below this .",
    "accordingly , the maximum observed energy , @xmath147gev , provides a lower bound to the altitudes of emission , since it must lie below any threshold energy for a super - exponential @xmath0-b pair production turnover .",
    "such constraints have been obtained for @xmath148 detections of the vela pulsar @xcite , and psr j1028 - 5819 @xcite , indicating that the super - gev emission must originate above at least 2.2 and 2.1 stellar radii , respectively . using a standard polar cap model estimate for the minimum emission height of @xmath149 ( e.g. inverting eq .",
    "[ 1 ] of @xcite ) , for a surface polar field strength of @xmath150 g , the psr j1048 - 5832 spin - down parameters ( @xmath151s , @xmath152 ) together with the maximum observed energy @xmath153gev in figure  3 yield @xmath154 .",
    "this drops to @xmath155 if @xmath156gev is deployed when defining this bound ( as was the case for the aforementioned _ fermi _ pulsar detections ) .",
    "similarly , for psr j2229 + 6114 with @xmath157s , @xmath158 and the maximum observed energy @xmath159gev in figure  4 , the altitude constraint is @xmath160 . for either case ,",
    "clearly these bounds preclude emission very near the stellar surface , adding to the advocacy for a slot gap or outer gap acceleration locale for the emission in both pulsars .",
    "although psr  j1048@xmath25832 and psr  j2229 + 6114 are both vela - like in age and spin characteristics , their light curves and derived emission geometries are quite different .",
    "table [ tab : sumres ] summarises the main quantities measured for both pulsars .",
    "the double - peaked light curve of psr j1048@xmath25832 is nearly identical to that of vela , whereas its derived efficiency is a factor of 10 larger than that of vela @xcite , adopting @xmath161 and @xmath162kpc . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray efficiency of j2229 + 6114 is very similar to that of the vela pulsar , but the pulsar shows a single , large peak similar to psr  j0357 + 32 discovered by searching for pulsations at the positions of bright @xmath0-ray sources @xcite .",
    "note that the efficiency of psr  j2229 + 6114 would be smaller at the distance of about 1kpc that some authors suggest .        with the growing number of detected @xmath0-ray pulsars",
    ", we are beginning to sample a wider variety of emission and viewing geometries , and pulsar ages .",
    "the range of light curve morphologies should allow improved constraints on high - energy emission models and a better understanding of the pulsar magnetospheric structure and acceleration process .",
    "for example , while many young pulsars , like j1048@xmath25832 , show vela - type light curves , a small number are similar to j2229 + 6114 , with a strong p2 component and a weak or absent p1 @xcite .",
    "mapping the angle range over which p1 is missing , especially when viewing angle constraints are available , can help narrow down the high altitude emission zone . a larger pulsar sample also allows a study of evolution of the @xmath0-ray beaming and efficiency with pulsar age :  the pulsars seen with _ fermi _",
    ", not including millisecond pulsars , span ages from 10@xmath76 to @xmath163yr @xcite , with hopes to extend that to larger @xmath164 ( lower @xmath38 ) as observations continue .",
    "analysis of the population of pulsars with interpulses @xcite and radio polarization data @xcite have given hints that the magnetic inclination is larger for young pulsars and decreases with age .",
    "thus we may even probe evolution of magnetic alignment during pulsar spindown .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden .",
    "the parkes radio telescope is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth government for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "we thank our colleagues for their assistance with the radio timing observations .",
    "the lovell telescope is owned and operated by the university of manchester as part of the jodrell bank centre for astrophysics with support from the science and technology facilities council of the united kingdom .",
