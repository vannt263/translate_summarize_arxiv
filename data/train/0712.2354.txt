    "the phenomenon of optical bistability already has more than thirty years of history , going back to the theoretical prediction of mccall  @xcite in 1974 , followed by experimental demonstration of the effect by gibbs , mccall , and venkatesan  @xcite in 1976 ( see also  refs .  , and   for an overview ) .",
    "since then a vast amount of literature has been devoted to explore the topic ( an extended bibliography can be found in our recent paper , ref .  ) ; controlling the flow of light by light itself is of great importance for optical technologies , especially on the micro- and nano - scale .",
    "more recently , new materials such as photonic crystals ,  @xcite surface - plasmon polaritonic crystals ,  @xcite and materials with a negative index of refraction ,  @xcite have revealed bistable behavior .    in our previous work ,  @xcite we studied theoretically the bistable optical response of a thin film of linear molecular j - aggregates . to describe the optical response of a single aggregate",
    ", we exploited a frenkel exciton model with an uncorrelated on - site energy disorder , taking into account only the optically dominant transitions from the ground state to the one - exciton manifold , while neglecting the one - to - two exciton transitions . within this picture ,",
    "an aggregate can be viewed as a meso - ensemble of two - level localization segments ,  @xcite which allows for a description of the optical dynamics by means of a @xmath0-density matrix .",
    "employing a joint probability distribution of the transition energy and the transition dipole moment of frenkel excitons , allowed us to account for the correlated fluctuations of these two quantities , obtained from diagonalizing the frenkel hamiltonian with disorder . by solving the coupled maxwell - bloch equations , we calculated the phase diagram of possible stationary states of the film ( stable , bistable ) and the input - dependent switching time . from the analysis of the spectral distribution of the exciton population at the switching point , we realized that the field inside the film is sufficient to produce one - to - two exciton transitions , confirming a similar statement raised in ref .  .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend the one - exciton model  @xcite by including two - exciton states and transitions between the one- and two - exciton manifolds , respectively .",
    "furthermore , two excitons spatially located within the same localization domain usually quickly annihilate , transferring their energy to an appropriate resonant monomer vibronic level .",
    "@xcite hence , the generalized model requires the consideration of exciton - exciton annihilation .",
    "@xcite we will assume that exciton - exciton annihilation prevents the three - exciton states from playing a significant role in the response of the film .",
    "the relevant transitions of the model are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : four level model ] .    to make the two - exciton model tractable",
    ", we will select the optically dominant transitions between the ground state and the one - exciton manifold ( as we did in  ref .  ) , and also between the one- and two - exciton manifolds .",
    "treating the different localization segments independently , in combination with the state selection , allows one to considerably reduce the set of relevant states , namely to four states of a segment : the ground state , the optically dominant one- and two - exciton states , and a high - lying molecular electronic or vibronic state , through which the excitons annihilate .",
    "this model has been implemented for the first time in ref .  , using the simplifying assumption that the transition energies and transition dipole moments are correlated perfectly . unlike ref .",
    ", we will account for the correct joint statistics of both quantities , similarly to our previous work .",
    "@xcite the optical dynamics of a single localization segment is described within the framework of a @xmath1-density matrix .",
    "we derive a steady - state equation for the output field intensity as a function of the input intensity .",
    "the field inside the film is calculated taking into account the field produced by the aggregate dipoles .",
    "we find that , counterintuitively , tuning away from the resonance may , depending on the dephasing rate , promote bistable behavior . in addition , we show that fast exciton - exciton annihilation combined with slow relaxation from the high - lying vibronic level enhances the tendency towards bistablity .",
    "the phase diagram of bistability is computed and compared with the one - exciton model .",
    "we address also the realizability of the bistable behavior in actual materials .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section we present our model of a single aggregate , consisting of a frenkel hamiltonian with uncorrelated on - site energy ( diagonal ) disorder ( sec .",
    "[ sec : single agregate ] ) .",
    "next , we describe the selection of the optically dominant transitions in sec .",

    "[ sec : ex - ex annihilation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : density matrix - field equations ] , we formulate our approach , based on the density matrix equations in the @xmath2 space of states , as well as the maxwell equation for a thin film of oriented linear j - aggregates . section  [ sec : steady - state analysis ] deals with the results of our numerical analysis of the bistable optical response of the film in a multidimensional parameter space .",
    "we identify conditions that are most favorable for bistable behavior of the film . in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimates ] , we estimate the driving parameters and the input light flux required for experimental realization of bistability for films of pseudoisocyanine j - aggregates .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "the geometry of the model system and the assumptions we adopt hereafter are essentially the same as in our previous paper .",
    "@xcite in short , we aim to study the transmittivity of an assembly of linear j - aggregates arranged in a thin film ( with the film thickness @xmath3 small compared to the emission wavelength @xmath4 inside the film ) and aligned in one direction , parallel to the film plane .",
    "the aggregates in the film are assumed to be decoupled from each other ; their coupling to the environment is treated through phenomenological relaxation rates ( see ref .   for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we model a single aggregate as a linear chain of @xmath5 three - level monomers .",
    "the two lower states are assumed to form multi - exciton bands , as a result of strong dipole - dipole excitation transfer interactions between the monomers . to simplify the treatment of the multi - exciton states ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the transition dipole moments between the two lower molecular states are considered to align in one direction for all monomers .",
    "then the ( frenkel ) exciton part of the aggregate hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) pauli operator of an excitation at site @xmath8 .",
    "the monomer excitation energies @xmath9 between the two lower states are modeled as uncorrelated gaussian variables with mean @xmath10 and standard deviation @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 represents the magnitude of the nearest - neighbor transfer integral .",
    "we assume that it does not fluctuate . after applying the jordan - wigner transformation ,",
    "the multi - exciton eigenstates are found as slater determinants of one - exciton states @xmath13 with different @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite the multi - exciton eigenenergies are given by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the one - exciton eigenenenrgies and @xmath17 depending on whether the @xmath14th state is occupied or not .",
    "particularly , we will be interested in the one- and two - exciton states :    [ one- and two - exciton states ] @xmath18 @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the ground state of the aggregate ( with all monomers in the ground state ) .",
    "we also will need the transition dipole moments from the ground state @xmath22 to a one - exciton state @xmath23 and from a one - exciton state @xmath23 to a two - exciton state @xmath24 . in units of the single - molecule transition",
    "dipole moment , they obtain the dimensionless form    [ eq : oscillator strengths ] @xmath25 @xmath26    where it was assumed that the aggregate is small compared to an optical wavelength .      at low temperatures ,",
    "exciton states reduce their extension from the physical size of the aggregate to much smaller segments as a result of the disorder - induced anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "we will denote the typical size of these segments as @xmath27 , often referred to as the number of coherently bound molecules or localization length in terms of the localization theory .    for j - aggregates ,",
    "the optically dominant localized states reside in the neighborhood of the bottom of the exciton band .",
    "some of them resemble @xmath28-like atomic states : they consist of mainly one peak with no node within the localization segment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : reduced wavefunctions]_a _ ) .",
    "we will denote the subset of such states as @xmath29 . to find all the @xmath28-like states from the complete set of wave functions @xmath13",
    ", we used the rule proposed in ref .",
    ", @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the inequality selects those states that contain approximately 75% of the density in the main peak .",
    "we found numerically that for a wide range of the disorder strength @xmath11",
    "( @xmath32 ) , the thus selected states accumulate on average 73% of the total oscillator strength ( equal to @xmath5 ) . recall that for a disorder - free aggregate , the optically dominant ( lowest ) exciton state contains 81% of the total oscillator strength of the one - exciton transitions ( see , e.g. , refs .   and  ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the @xmath28-like states , used as a basis to calculate the linear absorption spectrum , well reproduce its peak position and the shape of its red part , failing slightly in describing the blue wing , where higher - energy exciton states contribute as well .",
    "@xcite from this , we conclude that our procedure to select the optically dominant ( @xmath28-like ) one - exciton states works well .",
    "similar to the @xmath28-like states , one may also distinguish states that resemble atomic @xmath33 states .",
    "they have a well defined node within localization segments and occur in pairs with @xmath28-like states .",
    "each pair forms an @xmath34 doublet localized on the same chain segment .",
    "the levels within a doublet undergo quantum level repulsion , with their spacing nicely following the one that exists between @xmath35 and @xmath36 exciton states in a homogeneous chain of size @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite from the theory of multi - exciton transitions in homogeneous aggregates ,  @xcite we know that the slater determinant of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 states forms the two - exciton state that predominantly contributes to the two - exciton optical response .",
    "this gives us a solid ground to believe that the @xmath28-like one - exciton states and the two - exciton states composed of @xmath37 doublets dominate the one - to - two exciton transitions in disordered aggregates ( see below ) .",
    "usually , well defined @xmath37 doublets occur below the bare exciton band edge at the energy @xmath38 .",
    "these doublets are responsible for a hidden level structure of the lifshits tail .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath28-like states located close to or above the bare band edge , it is already impossible to assign a @xmath33-like partner localized on the same segment : higher - energy states have more than one node and spread over segments of size larger than @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reduced wavefunctions ] ) . to obtain all the states that give a major contribution to the one - to - two exciton transitions",
    ", the following procedure has been used .",
    "first , we selected all the @xmath28-like states , as described above .",
    "after that , we considered all the two - exciton states @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "( [ two - exciton states ] ) and calculated the corresponding transition dipole moments @xmath40 . from the whole set of @xmath40",
    ", we took the largest ones denoted by @xmath41 , were the substrict @xmath28 in @xmath42 indicates its relation with the state @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure catches all true @xmath44 doublets and assigns a partner to solitary @xmath28-like states , which do not necessarily look like real @xmath33 states . in fig .  [",
    "fig : reduced wavefunctions]_b _ , we depicted the final set of the doublets selected from the states in fig .",
    "[ fig : reduced wavefunctions]_a _ according to the above procedure , which contribute mostly to the one- and two - exciton transitions .    the average ratio of the oscillator strength of the thus selected transitions @xmath45 and @xmath46 turned out to be approximately 1.4 . for a homogeneous chain ,",
    "this ratio equals 1.57 ( then @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the similarity of these numbers gives support to our selection procedure .",
    "even stronger support is obtained from computing the pump - probe spectrum , using our state selection , and comparing the result to that of the exact calculations .",
    "@xcite the comparison revealed that the model spectrum only deviates from the exact one in the blue wing of the induced absorption peak , similarly to the linear absorption spectra .",
    "as was already mentioned in the introduction , two excitons created within the same localization segment efficiently annihilate ( the intra - segment annihilation in terms of refs .   and  ) .",
    "thus , the authors of ref .   studied experimentally the exciton dynamics in j - aggregates of pseudoisocyanine bromide ( pic - br ) at low temperature and found a 200 fs component in the two - exciton state decay .",
    "they attributed this to the annihilation of two - excitons located within the same chain segment of typical size of @xmath49 .",
    "we adopt this mechanism for @xmath50 states described in the preceding section .",
    "note that 200 fs is much shorter than all other population decay times .",
    "other processes , such as radiative decay , occur at times of tens - to - hundreds of picoseconds .",
    "two excitons located on different localization segments can also annihilate ( the inter - segment annihilation in terms of refs .  ) .",
    "this process , however , is much slower as compared to the intra - segment channel ;  @xcite we neglect it .",
    "the thermally activated diffusion of excitons accelerates the annihilation of excitons created far away from each other .",
    "we consider this diffusion - limited exciton annihilation as irrelevant to our problem , because for bistability to occur we need the majority of @xmath28-like states to be saturated ( also see sec .  [",
    "sec : estimates ] ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that the annihilation occurs via transferring the two - exciton energy to a resonant molecular vibronic level ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , which undergoes a fast vibration - assisted relaxation to the ground vibronic state .",
    "the population collected in this state relaxes further to the one - exciton state @xmath51 of the segment or to the ground state @xmath52 of the aggregate ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : four level model ] ) . in this way ,",
    "one or two excitations , respectively , are taken from the system . in summary , a four - level model , including the ground , one- and two - exciton states , and a molecular vibronic level through which the excitons annihilate , should be employed to describe the optical response of the film in the two - exciton approximation .",
    "within the four - level model introduced in the preceding sections , we describe the optical dynamics of a segment in terms of a @xmath53 density matrix @xmath54 , where the indexes @xmath55 and @xmath56 run from 0 to 3 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "they include a contribution from the population decay as well as a pure dephasing part @xmath82 , which , for the sake of simplicity , we assume equal for all off - diagonal density matrix elements and not fluctuating . by @xmath83 and @xmath84 we denote the detuning between the exciton transition frequencies @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and the frequency @xmath87 of the incoming field .",

    ", we note that the detuning effect found in our simulations is asymmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath134 : the behavior of @xmath158 versus @xmath159 is different for the incoming frequency tuned to the red or to the blue from the absorption maximum .",
    "we believe that this arises from the asymmetry of the absorption spectrum .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase diagram sigma ] we plotted the results of a comparative study of phase diagrams of the film s response calculated within the one- and two - exciton model under the resonance condition , @xmath130 .",
    "presented is the critical superradiant constant @xmath148 versus the quantity @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the homogeneous width of the one - exciton transition .",
    "the last term denotes the averaged rate of population relaxation from the one - exciton state to the ground state , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho11 ] ) .",
    "roughly , @xmath162 can be interpreted as the hwhm of the absorption spectrum accounting for both inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening ( through @xmath104 and @xmath163 , respectively ) .",
    "the upper ( lower ) solid curve in both panels was obtained for the dephasing constant @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) and varying the disorder strength @xmath11 . for a given @xmath82 ,",
    "the film is bistable ( stable ) above ( below ) the corresponding curve . to compare these results with those calculated under the assumption that the detuning is the only stochastic parameter ,  @xcite we also plotted the @xmath166 vs @xmath162 dependence taking all the transition dipole moments and relaxation constants equal to their averaged values ( dotted curves ) .",
    "one of the principal conclusions which can be drawn from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase diagram sigma ] is that a more efficient dephasing helps the occurrence of bistability : all curves calculated for @xmath164 lie above those obtained for @xmath167 .",
    "the physics of this behavior is simple : as the threshold for the absorptive bistability is @xmath168 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : effect of detuning ] ) , a smaller @xmath163 gives rise to a higher threshold value for @xmath127 .",
    "thus , adjusting the dephasing constant @xmath163 , we can manipulate the film s optical response .",
    "this conclusion has been drawn already in ref .   within the simplified one - exciton model .",
    "another observation is that the magnitude of the critical superradiant constant @xmath148 is considerably lower in the two - exciton model than in the one - exciton approach .",
    "this was to be expected from the physical reasoning which we presented above : a fast exciton - exciton annihilation combined with a slow relaxation from the high - lying molecular vibronic level favors bistability . without showing detailed data , we note that also the critical switching intensity , i.e. , the intensity calculated at the bistability threshold , is smaller in the two - exciton model compared to the one - exciton model . in both models , it also decreases upon increasing the dephasing rate .    finally , from comparison between the solid and dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase diagram sigma ] , it appears that , surprisingly , bistability is favored by the fact that also transition dipole moments and relaxation constants are stochastic variables and not only the detuning , as was assumed in the simplified model of ref .  .",
    "at first glance this seems counterintuitive .",
    "however , inspection of changes in the absorption spectrum allows to shed light of on this result .",
    "we found that upon neglecting the fluctuations , the absorption spectrum , first , acquires a shift which introduces an additional detuning off - resonance .",
    "second , the shape of the absorption spectrum gets more asymmetric . as the film s response is sensitive to both the detuning and asymmetry",
    ", the combined effect of these changes produces the observed big difference between the two sets of calculations . in principle , this discrepancy may be reduced by adjusting the detuning ; it is impossible , however , to correct for asymmetry .",
    "most importantly , this comparison shows that to adequately calculate the film s optical response , fluctuations of all variables should be taken into account .",
    "in this section we will analyze low - temperature experimental data of @xmath12-aggregates of pseudo - isocyanine ( pic ) to shed light on the feasibility of measuring optical bistability in a thin film of pic .",
    "we will focus , in particular , on aggregates of pic - br studied experimentally in detail in refs .   and  .",
    "at low temperatures , the absorption spectrum of pic - br is dominated by a very narrow absorption band ( hwhm = 17 @xmath106 ) peaked at @xmath169 = 573 nm and red shifted relative to the main monomer feature ( @xmath169 = 523 nm ) . for these aggregates ,",
    "vibration - induced intra - band relaxation is strongly suppressed ( no visible stokes shift of the fluorescence spectrum with respect to the @xmath12-band is observed ) .",
    "this favors a long exciton lifetime , which is highly desirable from the viewpoint of saturation , and thus for optical bistability .",
    "the lifetime of the exciton states forming the @xmath12-band in pic - br is conventionally assumed to be of radiative nature . for temperatures below about 40 k",
    ", it has been measured to be 70 ps .",
    "@xcite    within the one - exciton model studied in our previous paper ,  @xcite we found that the number density of monomers , required for the driving parameter @xmath170 to exceed the bistability threshold , has to obey @xmath171 @xmath172 .",
    "such densities can be achieved in thin films prepared by the spin - coating method .",
    "@xcite within the extended four - level model considered in the present paper , the critical ratio of @xmath170 may be even lower .",
    "thus , we believe that from the viewpoint of monomer density , j - aggregates of pic are promising candidates .",
    "another important requirement for candidates , potentially suitable for bistable devices , is their photostability .",
    "j - aggregates are known to bleach if they are exposed for a long time to powerful irradiation .",
    "therefore , it is useful to estimate the electromagnetic energy flux through the film . for the field slightly below the higher switching threshold",
    ", the dimensionless intensity inside the film obeys @xmath173 ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig : steady state gammar ] ) . using the expression for the monomer spontaneous emission rate @xmath174",
    ", we obtain @xmath175 .",
    "the electromagnetic energy flux through the film is determined by the poynting vector , whose magnitude is given by @xmath176 .",
    "being expressed in the number of photons @xmath177 , passing per @xmath178 and per second through the film , this value corresponds to @xmath179 photons/(@xmath180s ) . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : steady state gammar ] , above the switching threshold the intensity inside the film rises by an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , above threshold the electromagnetic energy flux reaches a value on the order of @xmath181 photons/(@xmath180s ) .    furthermore , the typical time @xmath182 for the outgoing intensity @xmath158 to reach its stationary value is on the order of the population relaxation time , which is 70 ps , except for values of @xmath158 slightly above ( below ) the higher ( lower ) switching threshold , where the relaxation slows down .",
    "@xcite this means that typically , a nanosecond pulse is enough to achieve the steady - state regime .",
    "bearing in mind the above estimates for @xmath183 , we obtain the corresponding flux for a nanosecond pulse @xmath184 photons/(@xmath178 ns ) . on the other hand , for a thin film of thickness @xmath185 and number density of monomers @xmath186 @xmath172 ,",
    "the surface density is @xmath187 @xmath188 . combining these numbers ,",
    "we conclude that only one photon per @xmath189 monomers produces the effect , which is well below the bleaching threshold .",
    "we theoretically studied the optical response of an ultrathin film of oriented j - aggregates with the goal to examine the effect of two - exciton states and exciton - exciton annihilation on the occurrence of bistable behavior .",
    "the standard frenkel exciton model was used to describe a single aggregate : an open linear chain of monomers coupled by delocalizing dipole - dipole excitation transfer interactions , in combination with uncorrelated on - site disorder , which tends to localize the exciton states .",
    "we considered a single aggregate as a meso - ensemble of exciton localization segments , ascribing to each segment a four - level system consisting of the ground state ( all monomers in the ground state ) , an @xmath28-like one - exciton state , a two - exciton state constructed as the antisymmetric combination of this @xmath28-like state and an associated @xmath33-like one - exciton state , and a vibronic state of the monomer through which the two - exciton states annihilate . to select the @xmath28- and @xmath33-like states ,",
    "a new procedure was employed which correctly accounts for the fluctuations and correlations of the transition energies and transition dipole moments , improving on earlier works .",
    "@xcite the optical dynamics of the localization segment was described within the @xmath2-density matrix formalism , coupled to the total electromagnetic field . in the latter , in addition to the incoming field",
    ", we accounted for a part produced by the aggregate dipoles .",
    "we derived a novel steady - state equation for the transmitted signal and demonstrated that three - valued solutions to this equation exist in a certain domain of the multi - parameter space . analyzing this equation",
    ", we found that several conditions promote the occurrence of bistable behavior .",
    "in particular , a fast exciton - exciton annihilation , in combination with a slow relaxation from the monomer vibronic state , favors bistablity .",
    "in contrast , fast relaxation from the vibronic level to the ground state acts against the effect .",
    "additionally , a faster dephasing also works in favor of the occurrence of bistability .",
    "the interplay of detuning away from the resonance and dephasing was found to be counterintuitive .",
    "when homogeneous broadening of the exciton states ( associated with the incoherent exciton - phonon scattering ) is comparable with the inhomogeneous broadening ( resulting from the localized nature of the exciton states ) , the detuning destroys bistability .",
    "oppositely , at a slower dephasing , the bistability effect is favored by tuning away from the resonance .",
    "we relate this anomalous behavior to an interplay of the absorptive and dispersive parts of the nonlinear susceptibility , which jointly contribute to the overall effect .",
    "we found that in general , including the one - to - two - exciton transitions promotes bistability .",
    "all critical parameters , such as the critical superradiant constant , driving the bistability , and the critical switching intensity are lower than in the one - exciton model .",
    "@xcite in addition , bistable behavior is easier to reach if the ratio of the inhomogeneous and homogeneous width is reduced .",
    "we also found that the stochastic nature of the transition dipole moments ( the aspect in which our model goes beyond ref .  )",
    "strongly influences the film s optical response .",
    "estimates of parameters of our model for aggregates of polymethine dyes at low temperatures indicates that a film with a monomer number density on the order of @xmath190 @xmath106 and a thickness of @xmath191 , achievable with the spin coating method ,  @xcite is sufficient to realize the effect . under these conditions ,",
    "one photon per 20 monomers produces the switching of the film s transmittivity .",
    "to conclude , we point out that a microcavity filled with molecular aggregates  @xcite in the strong coupling regime of excitons to cavity modes is another promising arrangement to realize an all - optical switch .",
    "the recent observation of optical bistability in planar _ inorganic _ microcavities  @xcite and the prediction of the effect for hybrid _ organic - inorganic _",
    "microcavities  @xcite in the strong coupling regime suggest that _ organic _ microcavities can exhibit a similar behavior .",
