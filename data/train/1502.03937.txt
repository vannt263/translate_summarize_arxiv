    "traveling waves in nonlinear hamiltonian lattice systems are ubiquitous in many branches of sciences and their mathematical analysis has attracted a lot of interest over the last two decades . in the simplest case of a spatially one - dimensional lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions ",
    "often called fermi - pasta - ulam or fpu - type chain  the analytical problem consists of finding a positive wave - speed parameter @xmath0 along with a distance profile @xmath1 and a velocity profile @xmath2 such that @xmath3 is satisfied for all @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the nonlinear interaction potential and the position @xmath6 of particle @xmath7 can be recovered by @xmath8 which implies the identities @xmath9 for the atomic velocities and distances , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath10 satisfies newton s law of motion @xmath11    the existence of several types of traveling wave solutions ( with periodic , solitary , front - like , or even more complex profile functions ) can be established in different frameworks ; see , for instance , @xcite for constrained optimization problems , @xcite for critical point techniques , @xcite for spatial dynamics , and @xcite for almost explicit solutions . however , very little is known about the uniqueness of the solutions to the advance - delay differential equation or their dynamical stability within .",
    "the only nonlinear exceptions are the toda chain  which is completely integrable , see @xcite and references therein  and the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) limit of solitary waves in chains with so called hardening",
    ". the latter has been investigated by friesecke and pego in a series of four seminal papers starting with @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "solitary waves have small amplitudes , carry low energy , and are spread over a huge number of lattice sites .",
    "the discrete difference operators in can therefore be approximated by continuous differential operators and the asymptotic properties are governed by the kdv equation , which is completely integrable and well understood .",
    "another interesting asymptotic regime concerns solitary waves with high energy in chains with rapidly increasing potential . here",
    "the profile functions localize completely since @xmath2 converges  maybe after some affine rescaling  to the indicator function of an interval , see @xcite or @xcite for potentials @xmath5 that posses a singularity or grow super - polynomially , respectively .",
    "the physical interpretation of the high - energy limit is that the particles interact asymptotically as in the hard - sphere limit , that means by elastic collisions only .",
    "the high - energy limit is another natural candidate for tackling the analytical problems concerning the uniqueness and the stability of traveling wave . in this context",
    "we are especially interested in the spectral properties of the linearized traveling waves equation  see the discussion in  but the convergence results from the aforementioned papers do not give any control in this direction .",
    "they are too weak and provide neither an explicit leading order formula for @xmath0 nor the next - to - leading order corrections to the asymptotic profile functions . in this paper",
    "we derive such formulas and present a refined asymptotic analysis of the high - energy limit for potentials with sufficiently strong singularity .      in order to keep the presentation as simple as possible ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to the example potential @xmath12 which is convex and well - defined for @xmath13 , satisfies @xmath14 and becomes singular as @xmath15 .",

    "moreover , the potential energy explodes in the sense of @xmath25 as @xmath26 .    beside of @xmath27 there exist two other small quantities , namely @xmath28 which feature prominently in the asymptotic analysis .",
    "the amplitude parameter @xmath29 quantifies the impact of the singularity and appears naturally in many of the estimates derived below .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 , which looks rather artificial at a first glance , is also very important as it determines the length scale for the leading order corrections to the asymptotic profile functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for the interaction potential and the waves from assumption [ ass : waves ] , the existing results for the limit @xmath26 are illustrated in figures [ fig.numwavesprof ] , [ fig.numwavesdata ] and can be summarized as follows .",

    "the corresponding results in @xcite also provide lower and upper bounds but no explicit expansion for @xmath37 .",
    "our strategy for deriving a refined asymptotic analysis is to blow up the profile functions near the critical spatial positions and to identify equations that determine the asymptotic wave shape with respect to a rescaled space variable @xmath38 .",
    "specifically , we use the _ transition scaling _ in order to describe the asymptotic velocity profile near @xmath39 , while the distance profile can be rescaled at both the _ tip position _ @xmath40 and the _ foot positions _",

    "the details concerning the convergence under the tip , the transition , and the foot scaling are presented in the theorems [ thm : ts.asymptotics ] , [ thm : trs.mr ] , and [ thm : fos.mr ] , respectively , while corollary [ cor : scalinglaws ] provides the explicit scaling laws for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath37 . moreover ,",
    "the combination of all partial estimates gives rise to the global approximation results in theorem  [ thm : globapp ] and corollary  [ cor : globapp ] .",
    "the above results provide an improved understanding of the high - energy limit of solitary waves .",
    "in particular , it seems that our asymptotic formulas can be used to control the spectrum of the linearized traveling wave equation , see the brief and preliminary discussion in .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the remainder of the introduction",
    "we prove the localization theorem and discuss both the results from @xcite and the justification of assumption [ ass : waves ] in greater detail",

    "in particular , we identify the intrinsic scaling parameters in and link afterwards in the rescaled distance profile to the initial value problem . in",
    "we finally employ the results on the tip scaling and establish all other asymptotic formulas .      in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ thm : localization ] since it provides the starting point for our asymptotic analysis in and . to this end",
    "it is convenient to reformulate the advance - delay - differential equation as @xmath49 where the operator @xmath50 stands for the convolution with the indicator function @xmath35 .",
    "this reads @xmath51 and the elimination of @xmath1 reveals that can be viewed as a symmetric but nonlinear and nonlocal eigenvalue problem for the eigenvalue @xmath0 and the eigenfunction @xmath2 . the proof that implies is straight forward and involves only differentiation with respect to @xmath18 ; for the reversed statement one has to eliminate the constants of integration by the decay condition @xmath52 .    using elementary analysis such as hlder s inequality we readily verify the estimates @xmath53 for any function @xmath52 , and this implies that the potential energy @xmath54 is well defined as long as @xmath55 .",

    "finally , the properties of @xmath5 imply @xmath78 so @xmath61 is a consequence of @xmath79 .",
    "we briefly sketch how assumption [ ass : waves ] can be justified using a constrained optimization approach .",
    "all key arguments are presented in @xcite for non - singular potentials @xmath5 but can easily be adapted to the potential . at the end of this section",
    "we also discuss the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the variational approach from @xcite is based on the potential energy functional , which is convex and gteaux differentiable on the open unit ball in @xmath64 ; the derivative of @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 so the traveling wave equation is equivalent to @xmath82 .",
    "we further introduce the cone @xmath83 of all @xmath84-functions that are even , unimodal and nonnegative , i.e. we set @xmath85 the key observation is that solitary waves as in assumption [ ass : waves ] can be constructed as solutions to the constrained optimization problem @xmath86 in the existence proof one has to ensure that maximizers do in fact exist and that the shape constraint does not contribute to the euler - lagrange equation for the maximizer . with respect to the latter issue",

    "we also compute @xmath104 and the proof is complete .",
    "the improvement operator @xmath93 can also be used to compute solitary waves numerically .",
    "in fact , imposing homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on a large but bounded and fine grid , the integral operator @xmath50 can easily be discretized by riemann sums .",
