    "a semantic graph is a network of _ heterogeneous _ nodes and links .",
    "in contrast to the usual mathematical description of a graph , semantic graphs have different types of nodes , and in general , different types of links . also called attributed relational graphs @xcite and relational data graphs ( used in the knowledge discovery literature ) , it is clear that the power of these graphs lies not only in their structure but also in the semantic information that resides on their nodes and links .",
    "examples of semantic graphs include citation networks where the nodes do not simply consist of papers , but also consist of authors , institutions , journals , and conferences .",
    "another example is the internet movie database where the nodes may be persons ( actors , directors , etc . ) , movies , studios , and awards , among others . in homeland security , these graphs are used in a variety of information analysis tasks @xcite . in particular , such graphs may be used for predicting threat vulnerabilities .",
    "data for semantic graphs come from relations parsed from text documents and/or data from relational databases .",
    "our motivation for this work comes from our experience in constructing semantic graphs from two sources of data  movies data and terrorism data  to be discussed at the end of this paper . in both these cases ,",
    "we were faced with a wide variety of choices : what are the node types , what are the link types , and how do these choices affect the algorithms that we intend to use on these graphs ?    several types of algorithms operating on semantic graphs are of interest to us .",
    "for example , to determine the nature of a possible relationship between two entities , a subgraph consisting of the shortest paths ( or another metric ) between two nodes in the semantic graph may be constructed and examined @xcite .",
    "we refer to this process as _",
    "relationship detection_. fast algorithms based on heuristic search ( which improve on breadth - first search or bi - directional search ) are available for this task , which either use or do not use the semantic information in the graph @xcite .",
    "these algorithms , however , depend on knowing which links ( or link types ) in the semantic graph are useful for detecting relationships .",
    "for example , two people who share a connection to `` san francisco '' because they were born there are unlikely to have any real - life connection .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to present automatic algorithms for determining which are useful links for relationship detection , as well as present concepts to help answer related questions .    in the past few years",
    ", a new field called _ complex networks _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ( 2002 ) and @xcite ( 2003 ) ) has emerged to study the structure of real - world networks . statistical tools for characterizing graphs and networks have been developed , with the impetus of understanding the relationship between the structure and function of networks .",
    "computer techniques have allowed these statistical measurements to be performed on very large real - world networks . in this paper",
    "we generalize some of these techniques in order to apply them to semantic graphs .",
    "for example , some types of nodes in semantic graphs can be connected to many other types of nodes , but generally have few actual links .",
    "we quantify this concept and hypothesize that nodes such as these are not useful for relationship detection .",
    "in addition , the concept of _ transitivity _ in social network analysis ( called _ clustering coefficient _ in the complex networks literature ) is useful for determining which are useful links for relationship detection .    in the following ,",
    "we begin by describing semantic graphs and ontologies .",
    "we then use the concept of transitivity for evaluating links and link types for relationship detection .",
    "an important aspect of this paper is a presentation of new statistical measures for semantic graphs , as well as issues related to the scale ( level of detail ) of semantic graphs .",
    "examples of semantic graphs for movies and terrorism data are given near the end of the paper .",
    "a semantic graph consists of nodes and directed links , with each node having a _ type _ ( e.g. , movie ) .",
    "the set of types is usually small compared to the number of nodes .",
    "each node is also labeled with one or more _ attributes _ identifying the specific node ( e.g. , _ shrek _ ) or gives additional information about that node ( e.g. , gross income ) .",
    "links may also have types , for example , the ( person @xmath0 movie ) link may be of type `` acted - in , '' or `` directed . ''",
    "( in this case , multigraphs , or graphs that may have multiple links between the same pair of nodes , are possible . ) in some semantic graphs , the meaning of a link between any two nodes is clear ( although different between different pairs of node types ) , and no link types need to be defined .",
    "finally , links may also have attributes .",
    "for additional details , see @xcite ( 1984 ) .",
    "depending on the types of nodes and links and on the available information , certain relations can or can not exist .",
    "the set of relations that can exist in a given semantic graph can be described by an auxiliary graph called an _ ontology , _ or a _ schema _ @xcite .",
    "more often , an ontology graph is created first by defining the types of relations that the semantic graph will encode .",
    "a small example of an ontology is given in figure [ fig : example ] , showing three node types : person , meeting and city .",
    "special links in an ontology graph could describe _ is - a _ and _ part - of _ relationships among node types .",
    "this is a node type hierarchy that will be briefly mentioned when we discuss the scale of semantic graphs .",
    "consider a node `` san francisco '' of type `` city '' in a semantic graph , and suppose we have a database of people which includes city of birth among the data fields .",
    "a node `` alice '' of type `` person '' may be linked to the node `` san francisco '' if alice was born in san francisco .",
    "other nodes linked to node san francisco imply a relationship to san francisco and in turn their relation to alice .",
    "however , it is not clear that such relationships give useful information about alice since most entities a short graph distance away from `` alice '' will have no real - life connection to alice .",
    "on the other hand , people born in a city such as `` tikrit , '' may have a much higher likelihood of knowing each other , that is , it may be important in this case to be able to associate two people through their city of birth . instead of using a human with potential biases to evaluate nodes and links , an automatic procedure is desirable for objectively determining which nodes and links should be used in the semantic graph for relationship detection .",
    "another example is nodes of type `` date .",
    "'' dates could represent birthdates , dates of meetings , etc .",
    "for example , a node for a person born on 9 - 11 - 2001 may be linked to a node labeled `` 9 - 11 - 2001 . ''",
    "however , two events sharing a date rarely predicts that two events are related .",
    "our bias is to treat dates as attributes of nodes , rather than as its own node ( with the type `` date '' ) .",
    "topologically , a `` date '' node may be connected to many other _ types _ of nodes , but generally each date node is connected to only a small number of other nodes .",
    "this may be an unbiased indication that a date is not useful for relationship detection .",
    "the concept of link transitivity is useful to address some of the above issues .",
    "if a node @xmath1 has a link to node @xmath2 and node @xmath2 has a link to node @xmath3 , then a measure of transitivity in the network is the probability that node @xmath1 has a link to node @xmath3 . in social networks and many other networks categorized as _ small - world _ networks ,",
    "this probability is high .",
    "this is natural in social networks because a friend of a friend is also a friend in proportion that is much higher than in a random network . in general",
    ", we refer to @xmath2 as a _ neighbor _ of @xmath1 if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are directly connected in a graph .",
    "also , we refer to the _ degree _ of a node as the number of neighbors it has .",
    "the concept of transitivity is quantified as follows .",
    "the _ clustering coefficient _ of a node , denoted by @xmath4 , is a measure of the connectedness between the neighbors of the node .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the degree of node @xmath1 , and let @xmath6 denote the number of links between the @xmath5 neighbors .",
    "then , for an undirected graph , the quantity @xcite @xmath7 is the ratio of the number of links between a node s neighbors to the number of links that can exist .",
    "we define @xmath4 to be 0 when @xmath5 is 0 or 1 .",
    "when @xmath4 is averaged over all nodes in the graph , we have the clustering coefficient for a graph .",
    "note that high average clustering coefficient does _ not _ imply the existence of clusters or communities ( subgraphs that are internally more highly connected than externally ) in the graph .",
    "we consider the problem of determining whether a node in a semantic graph ( e.g. , `` san francisco '' in a previous example ) is useful for relationship detection .",
    "consider a node @xmath1 which has links to many other nodes .",
    "for now , we assume the links are of all the same type . to evaluate whether or not @xmath1 is useful for relationship detection",
    ", we examine whether or not the neighbors of @xmath1 are actually related in the semantic graph with high frequency .",
    "whether or not two neighbors are related is decided by whether or not a link exists between the two neighbors .",
    "( a weaker condition if this does not hold is whether the two neighbors are linked via a third node which is already deemed a useful node for relationship detection . ) this leads to the use of the clustering coefficient defined in equation ( [ eq : cc ] ) to measure the relevance of a node @xmath1 with degree greater than 1 .",
    "the equation can be generalized so that @xmath6 counts links with the weaker condition described above .",
    "a threshold @xmath8 is needed and if @xmath9 then @xmath1 is a useful node .",
    "if @xmath1 is not a useful node , _ all _ the links involving @xmath1 should not be used for relationship detection and could be removed from the semantic graph .",
    "if these links are removed , @xmath1 could be made an attribute of the nodes that @xmath1 originally linked to , in order not to lose any information .",
    "the above can be generalized for semantic graphs when @xmath1 is linked via many different types of links . in this case , instead of a count of relationships involving pairs of neighbors of @xmath1 , a matrix @xmath10 is used instead .",
    "here @xmath10 counts the number of relationships between pairs of neighbors @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is linked to @xmath1 via type @xmath13 and @xmath14 is linked to @xmath1 via type @xmath15 .",
    "small entries in this matrix gives _",
    "pairs _ of link types ( associated with @xmath1 ) that should not be traversed in relationship detection .      the relevance of an existing or potential relationship between two nodes @xmath12 and @xmath14 can be evaluated by how many neighbors they have in common .",
    "more precisely a relevance measure may be defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the degree of @xmath12 .",
    "we have @xmath21 with large values of this relevance measure indicating a strong relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath14 supported by a high proportion of common neighbors .",
    "this quantity is similar to the clustering coefficient and can be generalized to involve neighbors @xmath22 farther from @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "there are many applications of this relevance measure .",
    "for example , pairs of nodes with no existing link can be evaluated to check if a latent link might exist . in another example , the relevance measure can be computed for all links of a given type .",
    "a low average of this relevance measure indicates that the given link type is not useful for relationship detection ; there is not a strong relation between nodes incident on a link with the given type .",
    "a high relevance measure for a link when the average relevance measure for the link type is low ( and vice - versa ) indicates an outlier that may be interesting to investigate .",
    "this relevance measure must be used carefully , however , since it uses links that it assumes confers bona fide relationships .",
    "it must also be recognized that a low relevance measure for an individual link does not imply that the link is unimportant . on the contrary",
    ", the notion of the `` strength of weak ties '' @xcite suggests that these links are critical in some sense .",
    "it is when almost all links of the _ same _ type have low relevance measure ( and this link type is not @xmath12 `` secretly knows '' @xmath14 ) that this link type should not be used in relationship detection .",
    "the clustering coefficient defined earlier has little meaning for semantic graphs as it mixes different types of nodes and it does not include the constraints imposed by the ontology . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the ontology for a semantic graph given by figure  [ fig : clustering_example ] . in this case",
    ", a node of type @xmath23 can be connected to types @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but a neighbor of type @xmath26 can never be connected to neighbors of type @xmath24 or @xmath25 . in order to avoid unrealistically small values of the clustering coefficient we thus have to divide by the number of links actually _ allowed _ by the ontology and obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the maximum number of links allowed by the ontology .     of type @xmath26 can never be connected to neighbors of type @xmath24 or @xmath25.,width=113 ]",
    "along with clustering coefficient , two other relevant graph properties that have been developed for standard ( non - semantic ) graphs are _ distributions of node degree _ ( number of neighbors of a node ) and _ average path length _ between any two nodes in the graph .",
    "together , these three graph properties can be useful for studying the properties of a semantic graph for representing knowledge .",
    "many real - world networks have high clustering coefficient , much higher than @xmath29 for random graphs , where @xmath30 is the number of nodes in the graph .",
    "we believe that properly constructed semantic graphs must also have moderately high clustering coefficients .",
    "low values of clustering coefficient may indicate that the linkage information in the semantic graph is incomplete .",
    "very high values of clustering coefficient may also indicate a poorly constructed semantic graph where all the nodes are very highly linked to each other ( the limit is a fully connected graph ) , indicating little discrimination in how the nodes are connected .",
    "the average path length , @xmath31 , in a semantic graph must also not be too small ( which is also associated with very high clustering coefficients ) .",
    "when the average path length is small , almost all nodes are approximately the same graph distance from each other , giving little discriminatory ability to path - length based algorithms for detecting relationships .",
    "for example , an ontology graph may contain a node ( e.g. , a node of type `` provenance '' ) to which every other node in the ontology is linked . in this case",
    ", the maximum shortest path length length in the ontology graph is 2 , which also suggests that the average path length in the semantic graph is small",
    ". it may be useful to identify nodes or links in the ontology graph that dramatically shorten the average path length .",
    "these nodes and links are potentially not useful for relationship detection .",
    "the connectivity distribution @xmath32 is of interest for semantic graphs , particularly the existence of nodes with very high degree , as in the case of scale - free networks  @xcite . in a relationship detection path search ,",
    "paths through very high degree nodes are deemed less informative @xcite .",
    "for example , in a social network , two people who know a popular person are less likely to know each other ; the linkages to the popular person should be disregarded in the relationship detection search since they may confer erroneous relationships .",
    "it is believed that power - law connectivity distributions arise when there is little or no cost involved in the formation of links in the network @xcite . without this property ,",
    "no nodes would be able to acquire a very large number of links .",
    "this may suggest that a graph with power - law degree distribution may contain many weak linkages .",
    "however , these weak linkages can not be disregarded ; cf . strength of weak ties , mentioned above .    for semantic graphs , we showed above how to extend the concept of clustering coefficient . in the next subsections",
    ", we expand the potential usefulness of other concepts for semantic graphs .      even in the simple case of connectivity",
    ", a given value @xmath3 of the connectivity of a node of type @xmath23 has no real meaning for semantic graphs . indeed ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : k_example ] the topological connectivity in both cases is @xmath33 but the meaning of it is very different in each case .",
    "-type node has topological connectivity @xmath33 but with a different meaning in each case , cf .",
    "@xcite ( 2002).,width=188 ]    in the first case , the environment is very homogeneous while it is not in the second case .",
    "another complexity comes from the fact that the number of @xmath24-type nodes can be very large thus inducing a bias in the connectivity of the other nodes .",
    "the ontology implies that each node of type @xmath23 can be connected to a certain number , @xmath34 , of other types . in the semantic graph",
    ", we have a total number of nodes @xmath35 and we denote the nodes by @xmath36 .",
    "the type of a node is given by the function @xmath37 .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the number of neighbors of type @xmath24 of a node @xmath1 of type @xmath23 .",
    "the usual topological connectivity of the node @xmath1 ( which is of type @xmath23 ) is then given by @xmath39 using this quantity , we can define the average connectivity of type @xmath23 which is just the average over all nodes with type @xmath23 as @xmath40    if we want to compare the different types relative to their connectivity , it is important to remember that some types can be connected to many others ( such as persons which can be linked to others persons , cities , meeting , jobs , etc . ) while other types are only linked to one type ( such as a conference which takes place only at one location ) . in order to compare the different types we thus have to rescale by the number of different neighbor types they can have according to the ontology : @xmath41    this quantity indicates the average number of neighbors _ per type_. this quantity",
    "however does not tell us if there are large connectivity fluctuations or if in contrast all nodes of a given type have essentially the same connectivity .",
    "we thus have to measure the connectivity variance _ per type _ which is calculated using the second moment @xmath42 with the dispersion per type given by @xmath43^{1/2 } } { k^{0}_{\\alpha}}.\\ ] ]    another possible way to characterize the connectivity distribution per type is to plot the connectivity distribution . however , the dispersion around the average is already a first indication of the nature of the connections for different types .",
    "for some cases , the fluctuations will be small , while for others it can fluctuate greatly ( such as the number of persons a person knows ) .",
    "the above quantities tell us the expected number of connections of a node of a given type to another type but not the correlations between different types .",
    "indeed , a type @xmath23 can preferentially link to a type @xmath24 while it could be in principle also be linked to other types ( as given by the ontology ) .",
    "we thus quantify the disparity ( or affinity ) of each type to link to other types . in order to do this",
    "we use a convenient quantity  denoted by @xmath44which was introduced in another context  @xcite . in order to understand the meaning of this quantity",
    "let us consider an object that is broken into a number @xmath45 of parts , each part having a weight @xmath46 . by construction @xmath47 and @xmath44",
    "is given in this case by @xmath48 ^ 2.\\ ] ] if all parts have the same weight @xmath49 then @xmath50 is small ( for large @xmath45 ) .",
    "in contrast , if we have @xmath51 and the rest is small implying @xmath52 then we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "this simple example can be easily generalized to more complicated situations and shows that a small value of @xmath44 indicates a large number of relevant parts while a larger value ( typically of order @xmath54 where @xmath55 is of order unity ) indicates the dominance of a few parts .",
    "we now apply this idea to the number of types to quantify the disparity of a node or the affinity of a type .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 is first defined for a given node @xmath1 of type @xmath23 @xmath56 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in order to get results with statistical significance , we average this quantity over all nodes of the same type and we also compute its dispersion @xmath57 : @xmath58^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these results must however be weighted by the fact that some types are more numerous than others which could be a reason why they appear more often than others . for a given node @xmath23 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the set of types which can be connected to @xmath23 as given by the ontology",
    ". if a node has @xmath3 neighbors , and if these neighbors are picked at random in the set of different nodes with population @xmath60 , we then obtain a disparity given by @xmath61 ^ 2.\\ ] ] again , this quantity will be very small if all types are uniformly present in the semantic graph @xmath62 ( where @xmath45 is the total number of different types ) and if it is of order unity then essentially a few types are over - represented . in order to take these heterogeneities into account it is thus necessary to rescale @xmath63 by @xmath64 and to form the factor @xmath65 and its corresponding dispersion , @xmath66    a large value ( larger than one ) of @xmath67 indicates that type @xmath23 preferentially links to a small number of types and that its neighbor types @xmath68 are diverse in number .",
    "if @xmath69 , the type @xmath23 may still be preferentially connected to a small set of types but the diversity of the numbers of each neighbor type is small .",
    "the dispersion @xmath70 indicates whether the behavior as described by the average value @xmath67 is typical , or if in contrast there is large diversity among the nodes of type @xmath23 .",
    "other usual quantities that are measured in order to characterize a large network can also be generalized without any difficulty .",
    "for example , degree distributions should be examined by type of node . in a semantic graph",
    ", the overall degree distribution may not be meaningful , but the degree distribution for a specific node type may be power - law , etc . as a further example , the average path length generalizes to become a matrix @xmath71 where @xmath23 indicates the source node of the shortest paths while @xmath24 is the target node .",
    "this matrix will in general have entries with very different values .",
    "given a knowledge base of relational data , the choice of ontology depends on what information needs to be captured in the semantic graph , and how easily certain information needs to be retrieved .",
    "the level of detail ( or scale ) chosen for the ontology ( choice of node and link types ) will have a direct impact on the properties of the corresponding semantic graph .    in the simplest ontology",
    ", we have nodes of only one type . in the example of the movies database ,",
    "this ontology is a simple network of actors without any types and two actors are connected if they played in the same movie . at the next finer scale , we have actors and movies as node types . in this case , the ontology is an actor connected to a movie if he played in that movie .",
    "this is a special case of a semantic graph which is a _",
    "network ( two types of nodes , with links only between the two types ) .",
    "coarser models lose some of the information present in finer models but can be useful for large - scale computations , such as multi - level search techniques .    at the finest scale of a terrorist network",
    ", we may have nodes of type `` religious terrorist organization '' and `` political terrorist organization . ''",
    "a coarser model may aggregate nodes of these two types into a new type , `` terrorist organization '' ( or the aggregation may occur directly if a type hierarchy is available ) . depending on what information needs to be preserved , it may or may not be important to distinguish between these two node types at the structural level of the semantic graph .",
    "we note that in homeland security tasks , data analysis more often involves searching for outliers rather than commonplace patterns .",
    "thus it is essential that the fine scale data is retained and the coarse scale data is used appropriately ( for example , as an aid in managing and processing large - scale data ) .",
    "here we simply illustrate the effect of scale on the clustering coefficient .",
    "we consider a random bipartite graph with poisson distributed numbers of both movies per actor ( with average @xmath72 ) and actors per movie ( with average @xmath73 ) .",
    "we suppose that we have @xmath74 actors and @xmath75 movies and the fact that each link connects an actor to a movie imposes the constraint @xmath76    this model can be considered as a `` null '' model since there are no particular correlations here . if one computes the clustering coefficient of the one - mode projection of this network , one obtains  @xcite @xmath77 this quantity is finite even in the limit of very large networks @xmath78 .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual random network for which @xmath79 where @xmath30 is the number of nodes . at this stage",
    "the conclusion is that the actor network is very clustered and different from a random network with no correlations .",
    "this is however clearly an incorrect statement since the existence of a large clustering coefficient here is a consequence of the network construction procedure .",
    "the `` movies '' test data at the uci kdd archive contains information about movies , persons ( actors , directors , etc . ) , studios , awards , etc .",
    "the data was originally compiled by gio wiederhold ( stanford university ) .",
    "we used this data to construct an ontology and semantic graph to express most of the information in the dataset .",
    "figure [ fig : imdb - ont ] shows the ontology graph that we developed . in the figure , the meaning of most of the links is obvious .",
    "however , the person - person link implies _ married - to _ , _ lived - with _ , or some other non - professional relationship ; the person - studio link implies _ founded _ ; the movie - movie link implies _ sequel - to_. we note that the data is very incomplete .        in this ontology ,",
    "the best meaning of the node role is unclear .",
    "for example , are two actors linked to the same role node in the semantic graph if they played the role of villain in two different movies ? alternatively , a role node in the semantic graph may only link to actors playing a given role in a single movie .",
    "we arbitrarily chose the former in our case .    a related question , which is structurally similar but semantically different is the following",
    "should two actors who win a best actor award be linked to the _ same _ award node in the semantic graph ? in this case we did not choose this interpretation since it seems that awards are individual entities , whereas roles are not .",

    "the results show high dispersion of average connectivity per type , for all types .",
    "further , the disparity of connected types is not particularly different from a random model .",
    "these indicate a relatively well - constructed semantic graph ; there are no particular correlations ( given the numbers of each node type ) and thus the information content in the graph is high .",
    "the results will be very different for the terrorism data .",
