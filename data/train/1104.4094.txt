    "decaying dark matter ( ddm ) in which the decay process happens at an early stage of the universe is natural for many models , and it is sometimes introduced as a way to adjust the dm relic density , because after decay the dm relic density will naively be lowered by @xmath2 one example is in @xcite , in which gravitino , overproduced by reheating after inflation , will decay into the true lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) axino as well as an axion .",
    "however , pure gravitational constraints for that decay process are less understood and sometimes even simply ignored . actually the model in @xcite with their parameters should be ruled out @xcite . here we will present a model independent computation , in which the effect is calculated from the first principle , and can be compared directly with cosmological observation .",
    "our model have both the parent particle and the daughter particles interacting very weakly , so the effect can only be manifested in gravitational effect , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large scale structure formation .",
    "our approach is based on a systematic modification of the cmb codes .",
    "` cmbfast`@xcite and ` camb`@xcite are cmb calculation tools which are based on the photon line of sight integration technique , instead of solving the boltzmann equation explicitly .",
    "they work in the _ synchronous gauge _ , the metric perturbation of which is gauged completely into the spatial @xmath3 part @xmath4 and the graviton @xmath5 can be decomposed into fourier modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8    then linearized einstein equation gives the equations of motion of @xmath6 and @xmath7 components @xcite    [ handeta ] k^2-&=&4ga^2t^0_0 , + k^2&=&4ga^2(|+|p ) , + + 2 - 2k^2&=&-8ga^2t^i_i , + + 6 + 2(+6)-2k^2&=&-24ga^2(|+|p ) .",
    "here overdot @xmath9 means derivative to conformal time @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the peculiar velocity which is defined by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the shear which is defined by @xmath14 .    with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 metric perturbation , the boltzmann equation in terms of the fractional perturbation",
    "@xmath15 is @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the comoving momentum and is _ conserved _ in expansion if the particle is collisionless , @xmath18 is the comoving energy , and @xmath19 is the direction of the macroscopic flow of the fluid .",
    "@xmath20 is the unperturbed partition function , and the real partition function can be defined with fractional perturbation @xmath21 .",
    "usually @xmath20 is thermal distribution such as fermi - dirac distribution or bose - einstein distribution , but in our ddm model for daughter particles it is determined by the decay process .",
    "after we plug into the collision term , we will find the formal photon line - of - sight integration solution to the boltzmann equation .",

    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the electron velocity .",
    "suffix p means polarization mode and integer suffix labels multipoles of spherical harmonics .    in ddm model ,",
    "metric perturbations @xmath6 and @xmath7 get significant contribution from the daughter particles .",
    "the perturbation evolution of the daughter particle has the same series with the massive neutrino    [ massive neutrino ] _ 0&=&-_1 + , + _",
    "1&=&(_0-_2 ) , + _",
    "2&=&(_1-_3)-(+ ) , + _ & = & ( _ -1-(+1)_+1)3 , + _ & = & _ -1+_.    the right hand side source term of eq .  ( [ handeta ] ) have contributions only from the first three perturbation modes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . because all particle species such as baryon , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , photon , massless as well as massive neutrino talk to gravity , all their evolution will be modified .",
    "the codes also calculate the transfer functions ( tf ) as an intermediate step in the cmb calculations , which is an indication of the large scale structure .",
    "the tf is by definition the normalized ratio of perturbation growth factor , from an very early stage to certain late stage , the normalization is taken with a very large scale which is out of horizon in the whole evolution @xmath35",
    "we introduce free parameter @xmath36 which corresponds to the daughter particles energy density _ today _ , while still keeping the nondecay cdm part @xmath37 . in this way we can treat any combination of decaying and nondecay dark matter . for convenience to use eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , @xmath36 is not the whole energy density but only the mass contribution to energy density , namely the kinetic energy of the daughter particle is not included .",
    "therefore we should have at least one massive daughter particle for this parameterization . except for an extreme relativistic decay ,",
    "the kinetic energy contribution is small and @xmath36 represents the energy density very well .",
    "we only consider the one - to - two decay process and introduce two mass ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are separately the masses of two product particles and @xmath42 is the mass of original particle .",
    "the last free parameter is the decay lifetime @xmath43 .",
    "so the complete set of new parameters includes @xmath36 , @xmath43 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "let us go through what will be modified in our ddm model , compared with the standard @xmath44cdm universe .",
    "first , the decay process will affect the expansion of the universe , through changing the equation of state . before decay the ddm behaves as the cdm with a constant equation of state @xmath45 , while after decay it does not hold and the momentum and energy of daughter particle is subject to redshift , as what happens to massive neutrino .",
    "since before decay the ddm particle can be approximated as being at rest , given the masses of the parent and daughter particles the initial transverse momentum @xmath46 is fixed for a two body decay . the comoving momentum for each individual daughter particle",
    "is determined only by the scale factor @xmath47 at which the decay happens ( in this paper we will always use a @xmath48 to denote the quantity right at decay ) .",
    "as the scale factor @xmath49 grows the physical momentum @xmath50 decreases , while preserving @xmath51 with this relation the energy density and pressure can be evaluated numerically for product particles in the modification , so is the expansion process .",
    "the decay is a continuous process for the set of ddm particles , the way for our numerical study is to discretize it into @xmath52 channels , by which we can achieve 0.5% precision for cmb peak height .",
    "each channel corresponds to daughter particles produced in a small scale factor region @xmath53 and has its own @xmath54 series . as the universe expands the channels",
    "are gradually filled channel by channel in order .",
    "the perturbation evolution is described by eq .",
    "( [ massive neutrino ] ) , the only subtlety comes through the factor @xmath55 : the unperturbed distribution @xmath20 is no longer the fermi - dirac distribution of neutrino , but determined by the decay process .",
    "a number of product particles proportional to @xmath56 will be redistributed into @xmath57 space @xmath58 , so up to some factor the unperturbed partition function from decay is @xmath59 and @xmath55 can be calculated @xmath60    the last issue for the perturbation evolution differential equation set is the initial condition .",
    "the initial values of all perturbation modes should naturally inherit the values before decay , which for ddm they are the same as cdm and all higher multipoles vanish .",
    "so we have @xmath61    including the daughter particles contribution to metric perturbation finishes our modification .",
    "generally speaking , because ddm induces no modification of the photon - electron - baryon plasma , the cmb anisotropy spectrum is only directly affected by the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect through metric perturbation .",
    "relativistic particles contribute more than massive particles to the peculiar velocity and the shear , because they are not suppressed by @xmath62 or @xmath63 factors .",
    "so the sw effect will be enhanced dominantly by the relativistic decay products , and the acoustic peaks will raise and move to higher multipoles @xmath64 , as what happens to a common sw effect .    as for the matter power spectrum ,",
    "structure formation requires dm particles to condensate into clumps , in order to amplify the density perturbation .",
    "therefore the dm particles must be moving slowly to be gravitationally captured , just like a slow incident comet will be captured by the sun to form an elliptic orbit but not the fast moving one with a hyperbolic orbit .",
    "if ddm is dominant and nondecay cdm does nt exist or is negligible , after decay on small scale the free streaming effect will prevent structures from growing , and the tf will be much lower than the nondecay case . if there is still sizable cdm , the small scale power is not completely erased , but only get smaller .    for certain decay lifetime between nucleosynthesis and recombination , there are two different approaches which may make the ddm model work .",
    "one is that the decay may happens to the dominant part of the dark matter , but the daughter particle has mass close to the parent particle and is very nonrelativistic , at least after redshift at the late recombination and structure formation epoch , so that the decay effect is minimized .",
    "the other is that the daughter particle is light and can be all the way relativistic , but only a tiny part of the dark matter today comes from it , so that its effect is constrained .",
    "we will separately call them nonrelativistic scenario and relativistic scenario . a combination of the two works for sure , but their individual effects are primarily interesting .",
    "cmb anisotropy @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 modes and @xmath68 total matter tf for various ddm model .",
    "the `` @xmath44cdm '' model ( black ) has the best fit cosmological parameters which apply implicitly to the following models .",
    "the `` fiducial ddm '' model ( red ) has @xmath69 completely replacing cdm , two mass ratios @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and decay lifetime @xmath72s . then we separately vary @xmath36 to be half of the fiducial value while the other half is still the cdm ( yellow ) , mass ratio @xmath73 ( brown ) and decay lifetime @xmath74s ( pink ) .",
    "we also show an example of very `` relativistic ddm '' model ( blue ) , which has @xmath75 and cdm component the same as the @xmath44cdm model , two mass ratios @xmath76 ( so that @xmath77 ) and @xmath71 , and decay lifetime @xmath72s .",
    "we then vary @xmath36 to be @xmath78 ( cyan ) and @xmath38 to be @xmath79 ( green).,height=268 ]    we present our sample calculations in fig .  [ sample ] .",
    "as expected , as we go to more ddm compoenent , larger mass hierarchy and longer decay lifetime , we see greater sw effect and greater free streaming effect .",
    "the tf is also calculated in @xcite . in models with no cdm",
    "we see very suppressed tf on small scales , and the oscillation structure of which is given by baryon acoustic oscillation .",
    "the two variants of `` relativistic ddm '' model coincide nearly exactly , which implies in that limit only @xmath80 matters .",
    "we have further run our modified ` camb ` as calculation tool for the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) program ` cosmomc ` @xcite for cosmological parameter evaluation .",
    "we are equipped with all current public data except for the sdss dr8 : 4 cmb data sets which are wmap 7 years , acbar , cbi and boomerang @xcite ; 3 matter power spectrum data sets which are sdss dr7 lrg , sdss dr4 and 2dfgrs @xcite , as well as supernova data .",
    "we are constrained to minimal @xmath44cdm plus ddm model , which is a flat universe of @xmath81 , no hot dark matter @xmath82 , standard cosmological constant @xmath83 , no tensor mode @xmath84 and no spectral index running @xmath85 .",
    "the channels we used are cmb , hst , mpk , bbn , age tophat prior and sn , which are consistent with that model and independent from each other .",
    "in addition to the 4 decay parameters there are 7 other parameters subject to monte carlo : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath11 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "decay lifetime and mass ratio regions for nonrelativistic decay scenario , where the dm is pure ddm and one product is massless ( left ) or two products have identical masses ( right ) .",
    "the black gridded regions which contain 95% mcmc points ( red dots ) correspond to @xmath92mpc ( left ) or @xmath93mpc ( right ) , and the green gridded regions which contain 99.7% points correspond to @xmath94mpc ( left ) or @xmath95mpc ( right ) , comparing to the yellow gridded regions of previous constraint @xmath96mpc @xcite.,height=172 ]    although a running for more general parameter space is possible , limited by our computing facility we are still working in the nonrelativistic scenario and the relativistic scenario , without exploring the intermediate region .",
    "first we consider the nonrelativistic decay scenario .",
    "we further constrain that all dark matter undergoes decay , which trade @xmath36 into @xmath37 .",
    "then we focus on some certain relation between two daughter particles mass for further simplification . corresponding to @xcite we",
    "do the case that one product is massless , the other one which we focused on is that the two products have the same mass . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ nonrelativisticplot ] .",
    "we find the allowed region can be described concisely by the free streaming length constraint @xmath0mpc at 95% confidence level . here",
    "the free streaming length is defined as the length measured today , where a ddm particle decays exactly at its expectation lifetime @xmath43 , and the daughter particle travels before matter - radiation equality .",
    "normalized to @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 in the identical products masses case the free streaming length is the same for the two particles ; and in the one massless product particle case it is defined for the massive particle , since it contributes to the structure formation . in fact we also checked the intermediate case such as one daughter particle is three times heavier than the other , in which the free streaming length can not be defined without ambiguity , and the numerical allowed region is a reasonable average of the two particles regions corresponding to the same free streaming length at the same confidence level .    decay lifetime and @xmath80 region for relativistic decay scenario . here",
    "we take @xmath99 .",
    "the black line which contains 95% mcmc points ( red dots ) is the constraint @xmath100 , and the green line which contains 99.7% points is @xmath101 , comparing to the yellow line of previous constraint @xmath102 @xcite.,height=172 ]    then we consider the relativistic decay scenario . here",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) to trade @xmath36 into @xmath80 of parent particle if it does nt decay , by doing so we are able to explore a large hierarchy region of relativistic mass ratio , the exact value of which has little effect as shown in the previous sample calculations .",
    "another way for expression is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are separately the ddm number and entropy densities .",
    "the allowed region can be analytically expressed as @xmath1 at 95% confidence level , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ relativisticplot ] .",
    "thanks to the high precision wmap data , it improves the previous one by 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "we see no supporting evidence to introduce the ddm , minimal @xmath44cdm is still among the best fit .",
    "we are not using the small scale such as the halo structure data , so we do not face the small scale structure problem of @xcite . here the scale of structure discrepancy is further constrained to be below 0.5mpc .    from high energy physics model building perspective ,",
    "our results put interesting constraint on the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) scenario in general , in which gravitino is usually a very light lsp .",
    "generically in that kind of model the gravitino mass is in hierarchy with all the other lsp candidate , and combined with large reheating temperature after inflation it is overproduced , probably by many orders .",
    "our results covers all the gravitino related decay process which is suppressed by the planck scale , where gravitino is either the parent particle or one of the daughter particle .",
    "it is very hard to introduce a decay process which can solve the so called `` gravitino problem '' and does not contradicts with observation , and the constraint is done in the most inevitable way , that the process can even escape electromagnetic and hadronic constraints .",
    "going beyond the gravitino model in gmsb , this constraint can still judge other exotic models which satisfy collisionless daughter particles condition .",
    "moreover , we would argue that this pure gravitational bound should apply to any ddm model even with interactions other than gravitation , since gravitational effect should always be the weakest .",
