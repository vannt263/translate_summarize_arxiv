    "such classical configurations of lines as the @xmath0 lines on a complex cubic surface or the @xmath1 bitangents to a smooth quartic plane curve have been extensively studied in the 19th century ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their automorphism groups were known , but only at the beginning of the 20th century were their close connections with the weyl groups of the root systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , recognized , in particular through the relation with del pezzo surfaces of degree three and two , respectively @xcite .",
    "del pezzo surfaces of degree one provide a similar identification of the diameters of the root system @xmath7 , with the @xmath8 tritangent planes to a canonical space curve of genus @xmath9 .",
    "can we go beyond the weyl groups and find a connection with the lie groups themselves ?",
    "the @xmath0 lines on the cubic surface are in natural correspondence with the weights of the minimal representation of @xmath2 , from which the lie group can be recovered as the stabilizer of a cubic form that already appears in elie cartan s thesis ; faulkner showed how to define this form in terms of the @xmath10 tritangent planes .",
    "a similar phenomenon holds for the @xmath1 bitangents to the quartic plane curve , which can be put in correspondence with pairs of opposite weights of the minimal representation of @xmath3 . in both cases",
    "the connection between the lie group and its weyl group is particularly close because of the existence of a minuscule representation . for @xmath7",
    "the minimal representation is the adjoint one and is no longer minuscule .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to use these connections with the lie groups , or rather the lie algebras @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , to shed a new light on the work of the classical geometers on line configurations .",
    "our main idea is that each time we consider a semisimple lie subalgebra , the restriction of the minimal representation branches into a direct sum of subrepresentations , and consequently the weights split into special subsets forming interesting subconfigurations . in the case of @xmath11 and the @xmath0 lines we get the following correspondence :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in the case of @xmath4 and the @xmath1 bitangents the notion of steiner complexes of bitangents make a natural appearance .",
    "they are special sets of @xmath12 bitangents which can be put in correspondence with positive roots , and also with points of a @xmath13-dimensional projective space over @xmath14 .",
    "this space is endowed with a natural symplectic form , and indeed the weyl group of @xmath3 is closely connected with the finite symplectic group @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to a very interesting finite symplectic geometry whose lines are known to correspond to the so called _ syzygetic triads _ of steiner sets .",
    "we prove that planes in this geometry are in correspondence with what we call _ fano heptads _ of bitangents .",
    "the upshot is a finite geometry modeling the symplectic geometries related to the third line of freudenthal magic square , whose last term is precisely @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "very interestingly , this leads to a beautiful model of @xmath4 and its minimal representation which , rather unexpectedly , turns out to be closely related with the fano plane and the octonionic multiplication .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath16 , the cayley algebra of octonions , can be defined as the eight - dimensional algebra with a basis @xmath17 , with multiplication rule encoded in an oriented fano plane .",
    "( 30,11)(-15,-1 ) ( -5.5,0 ) ( -3.6,4.6)@xmath18(3.3,4.6)@xmath19 ( -.3,-.8)@xmath20(-6.1,-.8)@xmath21 ( 5.5,-.8)@xmath22(-.2,9.7)@xmath23(.9,3)@xmath24    _ figure 1 . octonionic multiplication _",
    "this means that @xmath25 if @xmath26 are three distinct points on one of the projective lines in this plane , with a plus sign if and only if @xmath27 gives the cyclic orientation fixed on the line .",
    "we define an @xmath16-grading on a lie algebra @xmath28 to be a decomposition @xmath29 such that @xmath30\\subset\\fh_k$ ] if @xmath25 .",
    "in particular @xmath31 is a subalgebra and each @xmath32 is an @xmath31-module .",
    "more is true : for any point @xmath33 and any line @xmath34 in the fano plane , the direct sums @xmath35 are subalgebras of @xmath28 , so that we really have a configuration of lie algebras defined by a plane projective geometry .",
    "our discussion of fano heptads lead us to discover that @xmath4 has a natural structure of an @xmath16-graded algebra , compatible with its action on the minimal representation @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , attach to each line @xmath34 of the fano plane a two dimensional vector space @xmath37 .",
    "then we can describe @xmath4 and @xmath36 as follows :    @xmath38    going a little deeper in the lie algebra structure , we will discover a natural connection with the multiplication table of the cayley algebra .",
    "this leads to an amusing interpretation of the isomorphism @xmath6 in terms of _ harmonic cubes _ , and a permutation representation of the group of the bitangents on the triangles of the fano plane .",
    "a similar description of @xmath5 also exists , and the biggest two exceptional lie algebras appear as plane projective geometries whose points are copies of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and whose lines are copies of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "moreover , this octonionic model of @xmath5 makes obvious the existence of the multiplicative orthogonal decomposition that was a key ingredient in thompson s construction of the sporadic simple group denoted @xmath43 or @xmath44 ( see @xcite , chapters 3 and 13 ) .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to use this octonionic model , suitably adapted , to construct forms of @xmath5 over arbitrary fields .",
    "classically , two unifying perspectives on the line configurations we are interested in have been particularly successful .",
    "we briefly discuss the connection with our present approach",
    ".    * theta characteristics . *",
    "bitangents to the plane quartic curve ( a canonical curve of genus @xmath45 ) , as well as tritangent planes to the canonical curve of genus @xmath46 , can be interpreted as odd theta - characteristics .",
    "since the theta - characteristics can be seen as points of an affine space over the half - periods of the curve , this leads to an interpretation in terms of finite symplectic geometries in dimension @xmath47 over the field @xmath14 .",
    "this was developped in great detail by the classical geometers , in particular by coble ( @xcite , chapter ii ) .",
    "for example the theta - characteristics can be understood as the quadrics whose associated polarity is the natural symplectic form .",
    "isotropic linear spaces also have natural geometric interpretations . for @xmath45 one",
    "recovers the connection that we already mentionned between @xmath48 and @xmath15 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the weyl group @xmath49 is the automorphism group of the lines in the del pezzo surface of degree one , whose canonical model is a double covering of a quadratic cone , branched along a canonical sextic curve .",
    "as noticed by schottky , there is a unique even theta - characteristic vanishing at the vertex of the cone , which explains why the automorphism group of the tritangent planes is an orthogonal group @xmath50 rather than a symplectic group .",
    "* semi - regular polytopes .",
    "* gosset seems to have been the first , at the very beginning of the 20th century , to understand that the lines on the cubic surface can be interpreted as the vertices of a polytope , whose symmetry group is precisely the automorphism group of the configuration .",
    "coxeter extended this observation to the 28 bitangents , and todd to the 120 tritangent planes .",
    "du val and coxeter provided systematic ways to construct the polytopes , which are denoted @xmath51 for @xmath52 and live in @xmath53 dimensions @xcite .",
    "they have the characteristic property of being semi - regular , which means that the automorphism group acts transitively on the vertices , and the faces are regular polytopes . in terms of lie theory",
    "they are best understood as the polytopes in the weight lattices of the exceptional simple lie algebras @xmath54 , whose vertices are the weights of the minimal representations .",
    "coxeter investigated in great detail their semi - regular sub - polytopes @xcite .",
    "algebraically , this amounts to identifying certain lie subalgebras of the @xmath54 .",
    "but coxeter does not describe how the full polytopes are organized around these special sub - polytopes . in a sense",
    "this is what we will be doing in this paper , with the nice conclusion that it leads to a very natural , unified and easy - going description of ( at least part of ) the classical combinatorics of the line configurations , as well as new insights in the fascinating structure of the exceptional lie algebras .    _",

    "a classical elementary configuration of lines is the reye configuration below , obtained from a cube in a three dimensional projective space ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this configuration can be understood as a central projection of the @xmath55-cell , one of the regular polytopes in four dimensions .",
    "the vertices of this polytope are given by the roots of the root system @xmath56 ( we use @xcite as a general reference on root systems ) .",

    "can easily see on figure 2 , there is a unique way to partition the points of the reye configuration into three types , in such a way that each line contains exactly one point of each type .",
    "this decomposes the @xmath55-cell into three @xmath57-cells given by the vertices of three hypercubes .",
    "each of these defines a root subsystem of @xmath56 of type @xmath58 .    restricting the adjoint representation of @xmath59 to the corresponding subalgebra , a product of four copies of @xmath60",

    "( here @xmath63 are two dimensional complex vector spaces .",
    "note that the construction works on the reals to give the split form @xmath64 . )",
    "four - ality reduces to the classical cartan triality through the morphism @xmath65 induced by the permutation of the three partitions of four objects in two pairs . in terms of representations",
    ", this translates into the permutation of the three non equivalent eight dimensional representations of @xmath59 : @xmath66      among the models of the exceptional lie algebras that we will meet in the sequel , most will be derived from the _ triality model _",
    "first defined , in a more general context , by allison in @xcite , and rediscovered in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to associate to a ( complexified ) real normed algebra @xmath67 , its _ triality algebra _ @xmath68 with its three natural modules @xmath69 .",
    "then for any pair @xmath70 of normed algebras , the direct sum @xmath71 has a natural lie algebra structure .",
    "this leads to the famous freudenthal magic square , whose fourth line @xmath72 is the series of exceptional lie algebras @xmath73 .",
    "the lie algebras on the second and third lines of the magic square are endowed each with a special module : @xmath74 with the cubic jordan algebra @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with the zorn algebra @xmath77 .",
    "the natural inclusions @xmath78 then lead to the _ binary _ and _ ternary _ models for the exceptional lie algebras : @xmath79 this extends to @xmath80 , whose ternary model is the four - ality model related to the reye configuration . note also that the triality models can be interpreted as @xmath81-graded lie algebras , with a similar definition to the one we introduced for @xmath16-gradings .",
    "the configuration of the 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface in @xmath82 have been thoroughly investigated by the classical algebraic geometers .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the automorphism group of this configuration can be identified with the weyl group of the root system of type @xmath2 , of order @xmath83 @xcite . moreover , the minimal representation @xmath84 of the simply connected complex lie group of type @xmath2 has dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this is a minuscule representation , meaning that the weight spaces are lines and that the weyl group @xmath85 acts transitively on the weights .",
    "in fact one can recover the lines configuration of the cubic surface by defining two weights to be incident if they are not orthogonal with respect to the unique ( up to scale ) invariant scalar product .",
    "conversely , one can recover the action of the lie group @xmath2 on @xmath84 from the line configuration .",
    "faulkner defines a cubic form on @xmath84 as the sums of signed monomials associated to the tritangent planes @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer of that cubic form in @xmath86 is precisely @xmath2 .",
    "note that the polarization of this cubic form is a symmetric bilinear map @xmath87 .",
    "identifying appropriately @xmath84 with @xmath88 we get an algebra structure which is known to concide with the exceptional complex jordan algebra @xmath89 .",
    "the closed @xmath2-orbit in the projectivization @xmath90 is known as the complex _ cayley plane _ @xmath91 and should be thought of as the projective plane over the cayley algebra of octonions .",
    "being the orbit of any weight space it is circumscribed to the schoute polytope @xmath92 , which appears as a discrete version of the cayley plane . in particular the @xmath93 lines incident to a given line correspond to the polar quadric or @xmath16-line ( whose euler characteristic is @xmath93 ) .",
    "the property that two general @xmath16-lines on the cayley plane have a unique intersection point , thus mirrors the obvious fact that , two concurrent lines on the cubic surface being given , there exists a unique line meeting both .",
    "it is well known that most of the interesting subgroups of @xmath85 can be realized as stabilizers of some subconfigurations .",
    "it seems not to have been noticed before that most of them also have natural interpretations in terms of branching . by this",
    "we mean that we can find a subalgebra of @xmath11 such that the restriction of the representation in @xmath84 splits in such a way that the relevant subconfiguration can immediately be read off .",
    "there is a general recipe to identify semisimple subalgebras of a simple complex lie algebra , that we illustrate with the case of @xmath11 ( see @xcite , chapter 6 ) .",
    "one begins with the affine dynkin diagram , which in the case we are interested in has a remarkable threefold symmetry :    ( 30,7)(-10,-5 )    ( 0,0)(2,0)5@xmath94 ( 0.5,.4)(2,0)4(1,0)1.6 ( 4,-2)@xmath94 ( 4,-4)@xmath94 ( 4.3,-3.4)(0,2)2(0,1)1.5    then we choose a set of nodes , that we mark in black . suppressing these nodes we get the dynkin diagram ( usually disconnected ) of a semisimple lie subalgebra @xmath95 of @xmath11 which is uniquely defined up to conjugation .",

    "since their is a unique invariant quartic form on a factor @xmath268 , up to scalar , it certainly concides with the restriction of the invariant quartic form on @xmath36 .",
    "conversely , we know that up to the action of the weyl group , the monomials in the invariant quartic form on @xmath36 are of three types ( see @xcite ) : products of two , equal or distinct , products of two variables associated to opposite weights ; other products of four variables associated to fourtuples of weights of sum zero ( thus defining syzygetic tetrads of bitangents )",
    ". then we must give suitable relative coefficients to the sums of monomials of each type .",
    "this is fixed by restriction to a single factor @xmath268 since the three types of monomials appear in the hyperdeterminant ( see @xcite ) .      from the trialitarian construction of @xmath4 and the four - ality for @xmath39",
    "we deduce the model :    @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the following set of @xmath255 quadruples : @xmath273 these quadruples are in natural correspondence with lines : simply associate to a line the four points of its complement .",
    "moreover , the action on @xmath36 can be recovered geometrically : each quadruple @xmath274 in @xmath272 can be seen as a complete quadrangle in the fano plane , with three pairs of opposite sides which are sent one to the other by the @xmath4-action restricted to @xmath275 .",
    "let us rather try to reconstruct the lie bracket .",
    "consider two factors @xmath275 and @xmath276 : we have two indices @xmath277 in common , and the third point of the line generated by @xmath278 and @xmath279 is @xmath280 .",

    "the skew symmetry of the lie bracket then implies that @xmath284 the jacobi identity can be expressed in the following way : for each triangle @xmath285 in the fano plane , we have the relation @xmath286 the fano plane has @xmath1 triangles , hence @xmath161 quadratic relations .",

    "our claim amounts to the identity @xmath292 when @xmath293 are distinct and not aligned . to prove this we need to remember that the cayley algebra , although not associative , is _ alternative _ @xcite .",

    "we can reformulate our discussion as follows .",
    "the exceptional complex lie algebra @xmath4 has a natural structure of an @xmath16-graded algebra , given in terms of points @xmath33 and lines @xmath34 on the fano plane by @xmath298 moreover , its minimal representation decomposes as @xmath299    note that there is a quaternionic analogue of this construction , where instead of the fano plane we consider only one of its lines .",
    "this means that we glue three copies of @xmath39 along the product of four copies of @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting algebra is @xmath41 .",
    "we conclude that the lie algebra @xmath4 is the support of a finite plane projective geometry whose points represent @xmath255 copies of @xmath39 , and whose lines represent @xmath255 copies of @xmath41 .      we have just seen that the octonionic multiplication table gives a solution to the problem of finding a set of constants @xmath282 satisfying the skewsymmetry condition and the @xmath161 quadratic relations associated to the @xmath1 triangles in the fano plane .",
    "what are the other solutions such that @xmath287 ?    there exist exactly sixteen such solutions , falling into two @xmath301-orbits .",
    "each orbit can be identified , as a @xmath302-set , with a copy of the projective line @xmath303 .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first check that on a line the orientations must be coherent in the following sense : put an arrow from @xmath129 to @xmath185 if @xmath304 .",
    "then the three arrows on a line , if we draw it as a circle , must go in the same direction .",
    "in particular there are only two possible choices of signs on a line , one for each cyclic orientation .",
    "we can switch from one to the other by changing one of the basis vectors in its opposite .",
    "moreover , the possible solutions to our problem can now be interpreted as a coherent orientation of the seven lines in the plane .",
    "now we choose a triangle in the fano plane .",
    "we have eight possible orientations for the three sides .",
    "we observe that once we choose one , the orientation of the line joining the three middle points of the sides of the triangle is fixed , and that there are only two possibilities for the three remaining lines , those passing through the center of the triangle .",
    "moreover we pass from one to the other by changing the sign of the basis vector corresponding to the center .",
    "finally we check that once we fix a coherent orientation , we can transform it by @xmath305 to an arbitrarily chosen orientation on the triangle of reference .",
    "this implies that we have @xmath57 possible orientations splitting in at most two orbits .",
    "but there can not be a single orbit since @xmath57 does not divide the order of @xmath305 . to identify the two orbits with a projective line over @xmath306 , there just remains to observe that @xmath305 , up to conjugation , has a unique subgroup of index @xmath307 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests an interpretation of the isomorphism between @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "we obtained the following one which we could not find in the litterature .",

    "one deduces a special set of @xmath413 , and the complementary set of @xmath117 tritangent planes : the odd theta - characteristics of the former set are obtained as sums of three of the distinguished even theta - characteristics ( which is visible from the fact that they correspond to weights of a third wedge power ) , and the latter as sums of only two of them .",
    "there is also a strong analogy with the decomposition of @xmath4 that we described in example 2 above , from which we recovered hesse s notation for the bitangents to the plane quartic , and the so called bifid transformations . here",
    "the roots of @xmath5 , up to sign , are split in two types by the model we are discussing .",
    "the roots that are weights of the factor @xmath415 are indexed by a triple @xmath27 of integers between @xmath416 and @xmath417 .",
    "the roots or @xmath407 are indexed , up to sign , by a pair @xmath203 that we can identify with the triple @xmath418 .",
    "the tritangent planes are then indexed by the @xmath8 triples of integers between @xmath416 and @xmath93 , a notation first introduced by pascal ( see @xcite )",
    ". moreover , the group of the tritangent planes is generated by the symmetric group @xmath419 plus the symmetries associated to the triples @xmath27 , which are again called _ bifid transformations _",
    "( but beware that it does not contain the symmetric group @xmath420 ) .",
    "an easy computation shows that the bifid transformation associated to @xmath27 exchanges @xmath421 with @xmath422 and sends a triple @xmath349 to @xmath423 if @xmath424 is a permutation of @xmath425  while the other triples are fixed .",
    "there is a connection with the model for @xmath11 discussed in example 4 of section 3 , as we can see by splitting the nine dimensional representation @xmath102 into three supplementary spaces of dimension three .",
    "in fact the corresponding subroot system of type @xmath426 in @xmath7 is orthogonal to another @xmath137 subsystem , and we get another interesting model for @xmath5 , which is graded over @xmath427 : @xmath428 where @xmath429 are three dimensional and we used the notation @xmath430 . but",
    "this grading does not seem to be supported by any interesting geometry .          indeed , we get @xmath434 where @xmath435 are the three eight - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath59 .",
    "this models splits the @xmath8 tritangent planes into two groups of @xmath12 and three groups of @xmath177 . with which geometric characterization ?    then we can split each @xmath432 using four copies of @xmath60 ; we know that each of its eight - dimensional representation has a nice decomposition , and putting them together we obtain @xmath436 where @xmath272 is the following set of @xmath437 quadruples : @xmath438 as in the case of @xmath4 these fourteen quadruples form a _ steiner quadruple system _ @xmath439 .",
    "in fact there exists a unique such system up to isomorphism .",
    "_ such a decomposition is induced by the choice of a root subsystem of type @xmath440 inside the root system @xmath7 .",
    "this is equivalent to what du val calls a @xmath441 configuration in the polytope @xmath162 .",
    "there is also a correspondence with the @xmath142 even theta - characteristics , or the @xmath142 norm one vectors in the root lattice mod 2 , which can be seen as follows .",
    "consider such a vector , for example @xmath442 if we denote by @xmath443 the weights of @xmath340 . among the @xmath444 projective lines through @xmath445 , @xmath173",
    "are contained in the quadric , @xmath161 are tangents and only @xmath307 are true bisecants ; on each of these bisecants there is a unique point outside the quadric and we obtain a set of eight points defining a subsystem of type @xmath440 .",
    "let us consider our steiner quadruple system is some detail .",
    "we first note that each quadruple @xmath446 defines a copy of @xmath447 inside @xmath5 .",
    "we have thus constructed @xmath5 by gluing together fourteen copies of @xmath39 overlapping over eight copies of @xmath60 !",
    "we can interprete the @xmath437 quadruples in @xmath272 as _ points _ of a configuration whose _ lines _ are triples of type @xmath448 .",
    "a straightforward inspection shows that there are exactly @xmath1 lines .",
    "moreover , each line has three points and each point belongs to @xmath125 lines .",
    "in other words , we have obtained a @xmath449-configuration .",
    "this configuration has the following interpretation .",
    "consider @xmath450 , the three dimensional projective space over the field with two elements .",
    "it has fifteen points .",
    "choose one , say @xmath451 , and throw it away . since @xmath450 contains @xmath363 lines , @xmath255 of which passing through @xmath451 , we remain with @xmath437 points and @xmath1 lines whose incidence configuration is the one we are interested in .      1 .",
    "each point @xmath328 has an antipodal point @xmath452 , the unique point to which it is not joined by a line  in @xmath450 , this is the third point of the line @xmath453 ; 2 .   the @xmath125 lines passing through a point @xmath328 split naturally into three pairs , in such a way that the four points different from @xmath328 on each pair , belong to a pair of lines passing through @xmath452 ; in @xmath450 , these three pairs are cut by the three planes containing the line @xmath453 ; 3 .",
    "the configuration is made of eight copies of the fano plane , corresponding to the eight planes in @xmath450 not containing @xmath451 ; the other seven planes give sub - configurations of type @xmath454 which are pointed fano planes .",
    "but the most satisfactory way to understand our configuration is probably to see it as a _ doubled fano plane_. by this we mean that we can associate to each point of the fano plane a pair of antipodal quadruples , in such a way that the @xmath1 lines of the configuration correspond four by four to the lines of the fano plane . in terms of lie subalgebras of @xmath5 ,",
    "this associates to each point of the fano plane a copy of @xmath455 , and to each line a copy of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , there exists four copies of @xmath41 inside the @xmath42 defined by a line , meeting each @xmath40 corresponding to one of its points , along one of the two @xmath39 factors .",
    "we have even more structure if we note that each integer @xmath33 between @xmath416 and @xmath307 determines a copy of @xmath4 inside @xmath5 .",
    "two such copies meet along one of the @xmath41 indexed by the @xmath1 lines .",
    "this has an interesting combinatorial interpretation .",
    "consider the following @xmath456 array : @xmath457 it is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal , and each number @xmath458 between @xmath459 and @xmath255 appears once and only once in each line and in each column .",
    "if we associate to @xmath458 the four pairs @xmath460 of numbers indexing the lines and columns of the boxes where @xmath458 appears , this means that we obtain a partition of @xmath208 $ ] into four pairs , for a total number of @xmath1 distinct pairs : @xmath461 ( note that this array can also be obtained from the diagonals of each family of seven harmonic cubes of figure 5 . )",
    "these seven partitions index our seven lines in the following way : to each @xmath462 are associated the six quadruples obtained by selecting two of the four pairs .",
    "the incidence is given by the following rule : two lines being given , they can always be indexed by partitions of type @xmath462 @xmath463 , and then their intersection point is indexed by the pair of antipodal quadruples @xmath274 and @xmath235 .",
    "_ first application_. this construction of @xmath5 isolates eight tritangent planes corresponding to the roots of the eight copies of @xmath60 , the remaining @xmath464 tritangent planes being split into fourteen groups of eight .",
    "syzygetic tetrad _ of tritangent planes by the property that their twelve tangency points are the twelve intersection points of the sextic canonical curve with some quadric hypersurface .",
    "this means that they can be defined by four roots summing to zero .",
    "we claim that the eight tritangent planes associated to each factor @xmath275 in our decomposition of @xmath5 , can be split in two syzygetic tetrads in exactly six ways .",
    "indeed , the corresponding roots are the @xmath465 and two syzygetic tetrads are given by the following two sign tables :        _ second application_. an _ orthogonal decomposition _ ( od ) of a semisimple lie algebra @xmath28 is a decomposition @xmath467 into a direct sum of cartan subalgebras .",
    "such an od is _ multiplicative _ if for each pair @xmath156 , there exists an integer @xmath468 such that @xmath469\\subset\\ft_k$ ] .",
    "a trivial example is that of @xmath470 , once we have chosen a basis @xmath471 of @xmath120 . if @xmath472 is the associated canonical basis of @xmath473 , a multiplicative od ( or mod ) is given be the three lines generated by @xmath474 and @xmath475 .",
    "multiplicative od s have been used by thompson to construct the finite sporadic simple group denoted @xmath43 or @xmath44 . indeed , his construction relied on the existence of a multiplicative od for @xmath5 .",
    "in fact there exists , up to isomorphism , a unique multiplicative od of @xmath5 ( @xcite , chapter 3 ) .",
    "our construction provides it for free !",
    "indeed we just need to notice that each component @xmath476 can be split into the direct sum of two cartan subalgebras @xmath477 by choosing a basis @xmath478 of each @xmath340 , and letting @xmath479 where @xmath480 is @xmath478 or @xmath481 .",
    "this gives @xmath1 cartan subalgebras of @xmath5 , and we add three others , say @xmath482 , @xmath483 and @xmath484 , by putting together the od s of the @xmath485 s associated to the basis of the @xmath340 s that we have chosen .",
