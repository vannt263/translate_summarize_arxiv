    "autocatalytic reactions have long fascinated physicists and chemists because of their unique features@xcite .",
    "a chemical reaction is called autocatalytic if one of the reaction products is itself a catalyst for the chemical reaction .",
    "part of the reason for the interest in these types of reactions stems from the fact that even if only a small amount of the catalyst is present , the reaction may start off slowly , but will quickly speed up once more catalyst is produced .",
    "if the reactant is not replaced , the process will again slow down producing the typical sigmoid shape for the concentration of the product .",
    "all this is for a single chemical reaction , but of greater interest is the case of many chemical reactions , where one or more reactions produce a catalyst for some of the other reactions .",
    "then the whole collection of constituents is called an autocatalytic set@xcite .",
    "in addition to the interesting properties of autocatalytic sets , there is also an intriguing possibility that `` bootstrap '' reactions such as this may have had an important role in producing complex or self - replicating molecules required for the origin of life on earth@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the properties of autocatalytic reactions are typically of two kinds . in the first , rate equations for the reactions are written down and these are either solved numerically or their properties investigated using the techniques used in the study of dynamical systems .",
    "an alternative is to carry out computer simulations of the actual reactions themselves .",
    "however there is a third possibility : using methods from the theory of stochastic processes an analytic approach to the full model ( and not just the mean field version ) is possible . in the last few years this last approach has been used for systems which are closely related to autocatalytic reactions , such as predator - prey interactions @xcite , metabolic reactions @xcite , and epidemic models @xcite .",
    "these all show oscillatory behavior in the number of individuals or constituents , which arise from feedbacks .",
    "these oscillations are distinct from the limit cycles found in the rate equations , and are purely stochastic in origin .",
    "the main tool that is used to analyze these systems is the system - size expansion of van kampen @xcite which gives very good agreement with the simulation results , even for systems of a moderate size .    in this paper",
    "we apply this technique to the autocatalytic reaction scheme studied by togashi and kaneko @xcite . in most autocatalytic reactions",
    "there are two types of constituent : the autocatalytic and the substrate .",
    "the number of the latter type are kept constant by continually feeding them in , however the former are not injected nor extracted from the system . in this sense the system is closed as far as the autocatalytic constituents are concerned , but open for the substrate . in the scheme that togashi and kaneko investigate , the reactions are cyclic , with @xmath0 constituents @xmath3 reacting according to @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the chemicals are assumed to be in a container which is well - stirred , but with the possibility of diffusing across the surface of the container into a particle reservoir .    in their approach togashi and kaneko @xcite",
    "use only computer simulation to study this reaction scheme .",
    "the analytic techniques we will use begin by writing down the master equation for their reaction scheme , and then studying it through a systematic expansion in @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the system size . to leading order one finds the rate equations which appear in @xcite , and to next - to - leading order a langevin equation which describes the fluctuations about the stable fixed point of the rate equations . from previous work",
    "we expect that ( i ) this first - order correction will be sufficient to yield results which are in good agreement with simulation data , ( ii ) the large amplitude of the oscillations can be understood as a resonant effect .",
    "one of the strengths of the technique is that the next - to - leading order corrections give _ linear _ langevin equations which can be analyzed exactly for arbitrary values of @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ govern ]",
    "we derive the equations which govern the dynamics of the system , both in the deterministic limit and for the fluctuations about this limit .",
    "these fluctuations are analyzed in section [ analyse ] by calculating the power spectra for each chemical species @xmath9 .",
    "theoretical predictions are then compared to direct simulations for the case @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally in section [ concl ] we sum up and discuss possible future work .",
    "an appendix contains the intermediate steps required to find the equations given in the main text .",
    "the autocatalytic reaction scheme described in section [ intro ] can be formulated as @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) , are the rates at which the reactions take place and @xmath14 is the null constituent .",
    "such constituents have to be included so that the number of molecules of type @xmath15 , @xmath16 , are all independent . if the size of the system is denoted by @xmath8 , then @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of null constituents .",
    "while @xmath8 is fixed , @xmath18 may vary as the total number of molecules changes with time . in practice",
    ", @xmath18 does not explicitly appear in the formalism ; it is always replaced by @xmath19 .",
    "the rate constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ reactions ] ) represent the interactions of the system with the particle reservoir outside the container . in effect",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the rate at which molecules appear and disappear from the system , and thus are analogous to birth and death rates .    as an aside",
    ", we note that reaction rates which result from a binary encounter should be scaled by the volume of the system , @xmath22 .",
    "that is , @xmath23 .",
    "this follows from a straightforward kinetic theory argument@xcite .",
    "this is an innocent modification as far as this study is concerned , since it is carried out at constant volume , but it becomes crucially important when the volume is allowed to change , as it does in the analysis of the phase transition reported in @xcite .",
    "the state of the system is labeled by the set of integers @xmath24 and , under the assumption that the transitions from this state to any other only depends on these integers , the system is markov and may be described in terms of a master equation . in constructing the master equation",
    "we need to give the transition rates @xmath25 from the state @xmath26 to the to the state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "if the system is well - stirred , so that the probability of a reaction taking place is proportional to its rate and the number of reactant molecules , then from eq .",
    "( [ reactions ] ) these transition rates are @xmath29 the master equation for the probability that the system is in state @xmath26 at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 , may now be written down : @xmath32 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum^{k}_{i=1 } \\left ( { \\cal e}^{-1}_{i } - 1 \\right )   \\left[t(n_{1},\\ldots , n_{i}+1,\\ldots , n_{k}|\\boldsymbol{n } )   p(\\boldsymbol{n},t ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum^{k}_{i=1 } \\left ( { \\cal e}_{i } - 1 \\right )   \\left[t(n_{1},\\ldots , n_{i}-1,\\ldots , n_{k}|\\boldsymbol{n } )   p(\\boldsymbol{n},t ) \\right ]   \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are the step - operators introduced by van kampen @xcite : @xmath34    equations such as ( [ master ] ) are difficult to analyze , but if one is particularly interested in large or moderately sized values of @xmath8 , then the system - size expansion provides an elegant way of encapsulating the essential aspects of the model .",
    "the key assumption of the method is to write @xcite @xmath35 from this relation , @xmath36 , the fraction of the molecules which are of type @xmath15 at time @xmath30 , within the mean - field ( @xmath37 ) limit .",
    "the fluctuations about these are assumed to be gaussian , hence the @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) .",
    "one of the consequences of this assumption is that one is looking at a regime sufficiently far from boundaries that the probability density functions of the @xmath15 are gaussian .",
    "this implies that stochastic extinctions will not be well - described by the method , at least to leading order .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) allows us to expand the master equation as a power series in @xmath38 . to see this we first note that the step operators ( [ step_operators ] ) take a particularly simple form within the method @xcite @xmath39",
    "if we set @xmath31 equal to @xmath40 , the left - hand side of the master equation becomes @xcite @xmath41 substituting eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) into the right - hand side of the master equation ( [ master ] ) , and using the transition rates ( [ trans_rates ] ) , we may equate terms of the same order in @xmath38 on the left- and right - hand sides . to leading order",
    "this gives ( see appendix [ append ] for details ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a rescaled time : @xmath44 . at next order one finds a langevin equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath47 matrix which can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ a_i ] ) and ( [ aandm ] ) , and @xmath48 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlator @xmath49 and @xmath50 is another @xmath47 matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ b_ij ] ) .    the first equation , eq .",
    "( [ deterministic ] ) , is a deterministic equation for the fraction of molecules which are of type @xmath9 .",
    "it agrees with that of togashi and kaneko @xcite , if one takes into account that their equations are for concentrations and so contain the ( constant ) concentrations of the species in the reservoir .",
    "there is also an additional term @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ deterministic ] ) , which is typically present when mean - field equations are derived in systems with a fixed size , but not in the phenomenologically postulated form . for small concentrations",
    "it will not be important , but clearly it will have an effect as the ceiling on particle numbers is felt , reducing the number of molecules entering the container from the reservoir , as it should . the second equation , eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) , is a stochastic differential equation for the deviation from these mean - field values .",
    "it is the analysis of these two equations that allow us to describe the stochastic aspects of the autocatalytic reactions in a quantitative way .",
    "in their numerical studies , togashi and kaneko @xcite looked at the simplest case of the model where the rates @xmath52 and @xmath21 were the same for all chemical species . to illustrate our method we will do the same , and so from now on we will drop the subscript @xmath9 on these constants , but it should be clear that our analysis also applies to the general situation where they are different for each species . with this choice ,",
    "the deterministic equations ( [ deterministic ] ) have a single fixed point : @xmath53 where the asterisk denotes the fixed point value .",
    "if @xmath8 is so large that the fluctuations are completely negligible , then the system tends towards a state where the fractions of the chemical species in the system are equal , and given by eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) , and stays there .",
    "of course , if @xmath8 is finite this is no longer the case and there are fluctuations about this stationary state  and as we will see these can be significant even if @xmath8 is quite large . since these fluctuations are expected to be oscillatory , we begin their analysis by taking the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) to find @xmath54 where the @xmath55 denotes the fourier transform of the function @xmath56 .",

    "( [ solution ] ) : @xmath61 since @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath47 unit matrix , and since @xmath46 and @xmath64 are independent of @xmath65 , the structure of @xmath60 is that of a polynomial of order @xmath66 divided by another polynomial of degree @xmath66 . the explicit form of the denominator is @xmath67 .    from previous investigations of fluctuations of a similar kind",
    "@xcite , we expect that the fluctuations about the stationary state ( [ fp ] ) will be enhanced by a resonant effect : for values of @xmath65 for which @xmath68 is a minimum , the power spectra will show peaks which correspond to larger than expected fluctuations at that frequency .",
    "this effect was first conjectured by bartlett @xcite in the context of the modeling of measles epidemics , and later elaborated upon by nisbet and gurney @xcite , who called these stochastically induced cycles , quasi - cycles .",
    "however it is only in the last few years that explicit calculations within the system - size expansion have been carried out and a quantitative understanding of the phenomenon has emerged @xcite .    to understand the analytic structure of the power spectra , we begin by supposing that we can neglect the effects of the numerator on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ps_defn ] ) , and simply determine the dominant frequency by looking for the value which minimizes @xmath68 . the effect of the numerator will be to shift this frequency",
    "; we are assuming as a first approximation that this shift will be small , as indeed it has been found to be in some cases @xcite . if @xmath69 are the eigenvalues of @xmath46 , then the denominator of the expression for the power spectra may be written as @xmath70 since @xmath46 is real",
    ", the @xmath69 will be real or come in complex conjugate pairs , so that the products in eq .",
    "( [ det_phi ] ) has one of two forms :    * if @xmath71 is real , the two factors involving this eigenvalue give @xmath72 .",
    "* if @xmath71 is complex : @xmath73 , the four terms involving @xmath71 and @xmath74 give @xmath75    the resonant effect has its origin in the structure of the factor coming from the complex eigenvalues shown in the expression ( [ omega_sq_term ] ) .",
    "it is smallest , and so gives the largest contribution when it is in the denominator , for frequencies which satisfy @xmath76 if there are several pairs of complex eigenvalues and their conjugates , the largest contribution should come from the pair for which @xmath77 is smallest .",
    "clearly this will only be approximately true since , not only are we neglecting the numerator , but also the factors @xmath72 coming from real eigenvalues , as well as those coming from other complex conjugate pairs .",
    "however , as we will now see by looking at two specific cases , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , these approximations appear to be remarkably good .",
    "we study the cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 because they are the smallest even values of @xmath0 for which one complex conjugate pair and two distinct complex conjugate pairs , respectively , exist ( there are two complex conjugate pairs for @xmath78 , but they are equal , and three for @xmath2 , but two of these are equal ) .",
    "we therefore expect to see one peak in the power spectra when @xmath1 and two when @xmath2",
    ". our analysis , and the accuracy of our approximations , can be directly checked by numerical simulation of the chemical reaction system ( [ reactions ] ) by use of the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "this produces realizations of the stochastic dynamics which are equivalent to those found from the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "averaging over many of these realizations gives us power spectra after fourier transformation , which are exact to a given numerical accuracy .",
    "we now investigate the two cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 in more detail .",
    "the time evolution of the species is depicted figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "this clearly displays large oscillations which we aim to investigate analytically . before beginning this analysis",
    ", we observe that species @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( odd ) and @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( even ) are paired together and move up and down from the reference mean - field level in a synchronized fashion .",
    "this fact was already recognized in @xcite and shown to drive successive switches between the 1 - 3 or 2 - 4 rich states , close to the absorbing boundary , i.e. when a small number of molecules is simulated .",
    "the rate at which the changes occur is controlled by the diffusion parameter .",
    "however , the details of the transitions stem from a purely dynamical effect which can not be captured within the perturbative analysis developed here .",
    "let us now turn to analytically characterizing the aforementioned oscillatory regime . to this end",
    "we begin by determining the eigenvalues of the @xmath46 matrix . from eq .",
    "( [ eigen2 ] ) , these are @xmath83 within the approximations we have discussed , we would expect that there should be a single peak in the power spectrum for any one of the chemical species at a frequency given by ( see eq .",

    "[ figure2 ] we show the power spectrum ( for the chemical species @xmath85 ) found by averaging over 500 realizations from the gillespie algorithm , together with that found from eq .",
    "( [ ps_defn ] ) using the matrices @xmath64 and @xmath46 given in the appendix .",
    "the good agreement between the simulation results and those found from applying the system - size expansion , shows that the method works well for @xmath86 .",
    "the parameters used in this case were @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which gives a value of @xmath89 from eq .  ( [ peak_cond_4 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we see this is a surprising good estimate for the position of the peak , given the significant frequency dependence which we have neglected to obtain the estimate ( [ peak_cond ] ) .",
    "another check of the accuracy of these approximations , and so of eq .",
    "( [ peak_cond ] ) , is to imagine increasing the parameter @xmath90 at fixed @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and asking when @xmath93 will become zero , and so at what frequency will the peak in the power spectra disappear . from eq .",
    "( [ peak_cond_4 ] ) we estimate this to be @xmath94 which equals @xmath95 for the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 used in fig .  [ figure2 ] .",
    "once again this agrees well with the full spectrum which predicts the peak to disappear at about the same value . as a final check",
    ", we measure the position of the peak from a set of simulations run at different values of @xmath91 .",
    "direct measurements ( symbols ) are compared to the theory ( solid line ) in figure [ figure3 ] and are in good quantitative agreement .",

    "( [ eigen2 ] ) , the eigenvalues of the @xmath46 matrix are @xmath100 since there are two distinct complex conjugate pairs we would expect to find two peaks in the power spectra , one at @xmath101 and the other at @xmath102 . for small @xmath90 , one peak will be at a frequency @xmath103 times the other .",
    "we would also expect that the peak at lower frequency would be larger than the one at higher frequency , since @xmath77 is smaller for the former .",
    "that is , the pole in the power spectra in the complex frequency squared plane is nearer to the real axis for the peak at lower frequency , and so should have a bigger effect .",
    "so , in summary , our approximations indicate that the peaks in the power spectra should be given by @xmath104 with the peak at @xmath105 larger than the one at @xmath106 . the results of plotting the full spectrum found from eq .",

    "<S> we study a simplified scheme of @xmath0 coupled autocatalytic reactions , previously introduced by togashi and kaneko . </S>",
    "<S> the role of stochastic fluctuations is elucidated through the use of the van kampen system - size expansion and the results compared with direct stochastic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> regular temporal oscillations are predicted to occur for the concentration of the various chemical constituents , with an enhanced amplitude resulting from a resonance which is induced by the intrinsic graininess of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the associated power spectra are determined and have a different form depending on the number of chemical constituents , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we make detailed comparisons in the two cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> agreement between the theoretical and numerical results for the power spectrum are good in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectrum is especially interesting in the @xmath2 system , since it has two peaks , which the system - size expansion is still able to reproduce accurately . </S>"
