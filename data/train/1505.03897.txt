    "over the last decades , special functions have played a crucial role in studies related to natural sciences and engineering . in the wide field of wireless communications ,",
    "their application in various analytical studies often allows the derivation of closed - form expressions for critical performance measures such as probability of error , channel capacity and higher order statistics .",
    "furthermore , the majority of special functions are found to be built - in in widely used mathematical software packages such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the algebraic representation of any associated relationships as well as their computational realization , have been simplified enormously .",
    "+ among other , a special function related to the area of telecommunications is the rice @xmath0-function .",
    "this is denoted as @xmath4 and was firstly proposed by s. o. rice about six decades ago @xcite . in the field of digital communications",
    "it has been largely utilized in the study of zero crossing rates .",
    "in addition , it has extensively appeared in the analysis of angle modulation systems as well as in radar pulse detection and error rates in differentially encoded systems , @xcite .",
    "+ the definition of the rice @xmath0-function is typically given in an integral form with the involved integral being finite and comprising an exponential function and a modified bessel function of the first kind and order zero .",
    "alternative algebraic representations include two series expressions which were reported in @xcite .",
    "these series are infinite and are expressed in terms of the modified struve function and the modified bessel function of the first kind , @xcite . moreover , the author in @xcite reported useful closed - form identities that relate the @xmath0-function with the marcum q - function , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "+ however , to the best of the authors knowledge the rice @xmath0-function is not explicitly expressed in terms of other special and/or elementary functions . in addition , it is not included as a built - in function in the aforementioned popular software packages .",
    "+ motivated by these statements , this work is devoted in deriving upper and lower bounds for the rice @xmath0-function .",
    "these bounds are expressed in closed - form and are shown to be particularly tight .",
    "this is evident by the fact that for a certain range of parametric values , the lower bound virtually behaves as a remarkably accurate approximation .",
    "furthermore , the algebraic form of the derived bounds is relatively simple and therefore , convenient to handle both analytically and numerically .",
    "this feature renders them useful for meaningful utilization in analytical studies relating to the area of digital communications over fading environments @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : section ii revisits the definition of the @xmath5 function along with its existing alternative representations .",
    "novel upper and lower bounds are derived in section iii while their performance is analysed in section iv . finally , closing remarks",
    "are given in section v.",
    "the rice @xmath0-function is defined as @xcite ,    @xmath6    which is valid for @xmath7 .",
    "the notation @xmath8 stands for the modified bessel function of the first kind and zero order , @xcite .",
    "an equivalent integral representation to was proposed in @xcite , namely ,    @xmath9    in the same context , alternative representations for the @xmath4 function were reported in @xcite .",
    "these representations are expressed in infinite series form and are given by ,    @xmath10\\ ] ]    and    @xmath11 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where the notations @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote , the modified struve function , the modified bessel function of the first kind and the euler s gamma function , respectively @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-function can be computed by using the above two series alternatively . to this effect",
    ", equation converges relatively quickly for the case that the term @xmath15 is large while the term @xmath16 is small . on the contrary",
    ", equation converges quickly when the term @xmath15 is small while the term @xmath16 is large .",
    "+ nevertheless , it is noted that this method for computing the rice @xmath0-function is quite inefficient .",
    "the reasons underlying this statement are the following : @xmath17 two relationships , instead of one , are required for the computation ; @xmath18 the above series are relatively unstable due to their infinite form ; @xmath19 the @xmath12 function is not a built - in function in popular mathematical software packages such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    ", it is firstly recalled that the marcum q - function is strictly increasing with respect to the order @xmath57 , which is clearly illustrated in figure @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath37    @xmath38 + _ * remark . * _ a lower bound for the @xmath4 function could be theoretically derived by following the same methodology as in theorem @xmath42 .",
    "nevertheless , this approach ultimately leads to an analytic expression that is divergent .",
    "this section investigates the tightness and overall behaviour of the derived closed - form bounds . to this end",
    ", figure @xmath64 depicts the bounds in and with respect to @xmath65 , for @xmath66 and in comparison with results obtained from numerical integrations .",
    "evidently , it is shown that the upper bound is tighter than the lower bound for small values of @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is noted that as @xmath65 increases , its tightness degrades while the lower bound becomes significantly tighter . as illustrated in figure @xmath67 , this behaviour also holds for relatively small values of @xmath65 as well as for different values of @xmath68 .",
    "+ interestingly enough , for large values of @xmath65-typically @xmath69- the lower bound in nearly becomes an exact representation for @xmath4 as it appears to behave as a remarkably accurate approximation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure @xmath70 where for the case that @xmath71 , equation provides an excellent match to the corresponding theoretical results .",
    "this is also justified by the low level of the involved absolute relative error which is given by @xmath72 , and is depicted in figure @xmath73 .",
    "this work was devoted in the derivation of novel upper and lower bounds for the rice @xmath0-function .",
    "these bounds are expressed in closed - form and are shown to be quite tight .",
    "this is particularly the case for the lower bound since for large values of the argument @xmath65 , it becomes a remarkably accurate approximation to @xmath0-function over the whole range of values of @xmath68 . as a result",
    ", it virtually behaves as an exact expression .",
    "another advantage of the derived bounds is that their algebraic representation is relatively simple and therefore rather tractable both analytically and numerically .",
