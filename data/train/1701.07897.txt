    "in this survey , we would like to present some recent research directions in the study of variational problems whose minimizers naturally exhibit the formation of free boundaries . differently than the cases considered in most of the existing literature , the problems that we present here are either _ nonlinear _ ( in the sense that the energy functional is the nonlinear superposition of classical energy contributions ) or _ nonlocal _ ( in the sense that some of the energy contributions involve objects that depend on the global geometry of the system ) .    in these settings ,",
    "the problems typically show new features and additional difficulties with respect to the classical cases .",
    "in particular , as we will discuss in further details : the regularity theory is more complicated , there is a lack of scale invariance for some problems , the natural scaling properties of the energy may not be compatible with the optimal regularity , the condition at the free boundary may be of nonlocal or nonlinear type and involve the global behavior of the solution itself , and some problems may exhibit a variational instability ( e.g. , minimizers in large domains and in small domains may dramatically differ the ones from the others ) .",
    "we will also discuss how the classical free boundary problems in  @xcite are recovered either as limit problems or after a blow - up , under appropriate structural conditions on the energy functional .",
    "we recall the classical free boundary problems of  @xcite in section  [ 89102 ] .",
    "the results concerning nonlocal free boundary problems will be presented in section  [ sec2 ] , while the case of nonlinear energy superposition is discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "a classical problem in fluid dynamics is the description of a two - dimensional ideal fluid in terms of its stream function , i.e. of a function whose level sets describe the trajectories of the fluid . for this",
    ", we consider an incompressible , irrotational and inviscid fluid which occupies a given planar region  @xmath0 .",
    "if  @xmath1 represents the velocity of the particles of the fluid , the incompressibility condition implies that the flow of the fluid through any portions of  @xmath2 is zero ( the amount of fluid coming in is exactly the same as the one going out ) , that is , for any  @xmath3 , and denoting by  @xmath4 the exterior normal vector , @xmath5 since this is valid for any subdomain of  @xmath2 , we thus infer that @xmath6 now , we use that the fluid is irrotational to write equation   as a second order pde . to this aim ,",
    "let us analyze what a `` vortex '' is .",
    "roughly speaking , a vortex is given by a close trajectory , say  @xmath7 , along which the fluid particles move . in this way , the velocity field  @xmath8 is always parallel to the tangent direction  @xmath9 and therefore @xmath10 where the standard notation for the circulation line integral is used .",
    "that is , if we denote by  @xmath11 the region inside  @xmath2 enclosed by the curve  @xmath12 ( hence , @xmath13 ) , we infer by   and stokes theorem that @xmath14 where , as usual , we write  @xmath15 to denote the standard basis of  @xmath16 , we identify the vector  @xmath17 with its three - dimensional image  @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in this setting , the fact that the fluid is irrotational is translated in mathematical language into the fact that the opposite of   holds true , namely @xmath20 for any  @xmath21 ( say , with smooth boundary ) . since this is valid for any arbitrary region  @xmath11 , we thus can translate the irrotational property of the fluid into the condition  @xmath22 in  @xmath2 , that is @xmath23 now , we consider the @xmath24-form @xmath25 and we have that @xmath26 thanks to  .",
    "namely @xmath27 is closed , and thus exact ( by poincar lemma , at least if  @xmath2 is star - shaped ) .",
    "this says that there exists a function  @xmath28 such that @xmath29 by comparing this and  , we conclude that @xmath30 we observe that @xmath28 is a stream function for the fluid , namely the fluid particles move along the level sets of  @xmath28 : indeed , if  @xmath31 is the position of the fluid particle at time  @xmath32 , we have that  @xmath33 is the velocity of the fluid , and @xmath34 in view of  .",
    "the stream function  @xmath28 also satisfies a natural overdetermined problem .",
    "first of all , since  @xmath35 represents the boundary of the fluid , and the fluid motion occurs on the level sets of  @xmath28 , up to constants we may assume that  @xmath36 along  @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , along  @xmath35 bernoulli s law prescribes that the velocity is balanced by the pressure ( which we take here to be @xmath37 ) .",
    "that is , up to dimensional constants , we can write that , along  @xmath35 , @xmath38 where we used again   in the last identity .    also , and   give that , in  @xmath2 , @xmath39 that is , summarizing , @xmath40 notice that these types of overdetermined problems are , in general , not solvable : namely , only `` very special '' domains allow a solution of such overdetermined problem to exist ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this spirit , determining such domain  @xmath2 is part of the problem itself , and the boundary of  @xmath2 is , in this sense , a `` free boundary '' to be determined together with the solution  @xmath28 .",
    "these kinds of free boundary problems have a natural formulation , which was widely studied in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider an energy functional which is the superposition of a dirichlet part and a volume term . by an appropriate domain variation",
    ", one sees that minimizers ( or , more generally , critical points ) of this functional correspond ( at least in a weak sense ) to solutions of   ( compare , for instance , the system in   here with lemma  2.4 and theorem  2.5 in  @xcite ) .",
    "needless to say , in this framework , the analysis of the minimizers of this energy functional and of their level sets becomes a crucial topic of research .    in  @xcite a different energy functional",
    "is taken into account , in which the volume term is substituted by a perimeter term .",
    "this modification provides a natural change in the free boundary condition ( in this setting , the pressure of the bernoulli s law is replaced by the curvature of the level set , see formula  ( 6.1 ) in  @xcite ) .    in the following sections we will discuss what happens when :    * we interpolate the volume term of the energy functional of  @xcite and the perimeter term of the energy functional of  @xcite with a fractional perimeter term , which recovers the volume and the classical perimeter in the limit ; * we consider a nonlinear energy superposition , in which the total energy depends on the volume , or on the ( possibly fractional ) perimeter , in a nonlinear fashion",
    "a classical motivation for free boundary problems comes from the superposition of a `` dirichlet - type energy ''  @xmath41 and an `` interfacial energy ''  @xmath42 .",
    "roughly speaking , one may consider the minimization problem of an energy functional @xmath43 which takes into account the following two tendencies of the energy contributions , namely :    * the term @xmath41 tries to reduce the oscillations of the minimizers , * while the term  @xmath42 penalizes the formation of interfaces .",
    "two classical approaches appear in the literature to measure these interfaces , taking into account the `` volume '' of the phases or the `` perimeter '' of the phase separations .",
    "the first approach , based on a `` bulk '' energy contribution , was widely studied in  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the energy superposition in   ( with respect to a reference domain  @xmath44 ) takes the form @xmath45 where  @xmath46 denotes , as customary , the @xmath47-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "the case of two phase contributions ( namely , the one which takes into account the bulk energy of both @xmath48 and  @xmath49 ) was also considered in  @xcite .    the second approach , based on a `` surface tension '' energy contribution , was introduced in  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the energy superposition in   takes the form @xmath50 where the notation @xmath51_{bv(\\omega)}\\ ] ] represents the perimeter of the set  @xmath52 in  @xmath2 ; hence , if  @xmath52 has smooth boundary , then @xmath53 , being  @xmath54 the @xmath55-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the two free boundary problems in   and   can be settled into a unified framework , and in fact they may be seen as `` extremal '' problems of a family of energy functionals indexed by a continuous parameter  @xmath56 .",
    "to this aim , given two measurable sets  @xmath52 , @xmath57 , with  @xmath58 , one considers the @xmath59-interaction of  @xmath52 and  @xmath60 , as given by the double integral @xmath61 in  @xcite , the notion of @xmath59-minimal surfaces has been introduced by considering minimizers of the @xmath59-perimeter induced by such interaction .",
    "namely , one defines the @xmath59-perimeter of  @xmath52 in  @xmath2 as the contribution relative to  @xmath2 of the @xmath59-interaction of  @xmath52 and its complement ( which we denote by  @xmath62 ) , that is @xmath63 after  @xcite , an intense activity has been performed to investigate the regularity and the geometric properties of @xmath59-minimal surfaces : see in particular  @xcite for interior regularity results , and  @xcite for the rather special behavior of @xmath59-minimal surfaces near the boundary of the domain .",
    "see also  @xcite for a recent survey on @xmath59-minimal surfaces .    the analysis of the asymptotics of the @xmath59-perimeter as  @xmath64 has been studied under several perspectives in  @xcite",
    ". roughly speaking , up to normalization constants , we may say that  @xmath65 approaches the classical perimeter as  @xmath64 . on the other hand , as  @xmath66 ,",
    "we have that  @xmath65 approaches the lebesgue measure ( again , up to normalization constants , see  @xcite for precise statements and examples ) .    in virtue of these considerations",
    ", we have that the free boundary problem introduced in  @xcite , which takes into account the energy superposition in   of the form @xmath67 may be seen as an interpolation of the problems stated in   and   ( that is , at least at a formal level , the energy functional in   reduces to that in   as  @xmath66 and to that in   as  @xmath64 ) .    a nonlocal variation of the classical dirichlet energy has been also considered in  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the classical @xmath68-seminorm in  @xmath2 of a function  @xmath28 is replaced by a gagliardo @xmath69-seminorm of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 and  @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , in  @xcite a superposition of the gagliardo seminorm and the lebesgue measure of the positivity set is taken into account .",
    "it is worth to point out that the domain  @xmath73 in   comprises all the interactions of points  @xmath74 which involve the domain  @xmath2 , since  @xmath75 .    in this sense ,",
    "the integration over  @xmath76 is the natural counterpart of the classical integration over  @xmath2 of the standard dirichlet energy , since  @xmath77 .",
    "also , the double integral in   recovers the classical dirichlet energy , see e.g.  @xcite .    in this spirit , in  @xcite a fully nonlocal counterpart of the free boundary problems in   and   has been introduced , by studying energy superpositions of gagliardo norms and fractional perimeters ( see also  @xcite for the superpositions of gagliardo norms and classical perimeters ) . more precisely , the energy superposition in   considered in  @xcite takes the form @xmath78 where  @xmath79 , @xmath56 .",
    "we summarize here a series of results recently obtained in  @xcite for these nonlocal free boundary problems ( some of these results also rely on a notion of fractional harmonic replacement analyzed in  @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , we have that minimizers of free boundary problems with fractional perimeter interfaces are continuous , possess suitable density estimates and have smooth free boundaries up to sets of codimension  3 :    [ cc67 ] [ theorems 1.1 and 1.2 in @xcite ] let  @xmath80 be a minimizer of @xmath81 with  @xmath56 and  @xmath82 .",
    "then  @xmath83 is locally  @xmath84 and , for any  @xmath85 , @xmath86 for some  @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the free boundary is a @xmath88-hypersurface possibly outside a small singular set of haussdorff dimension  @xmath89 .",
    "we remark that the hlder exponent  @xmath90 is consistent with the natural scaling of the problem ( namely  @xmath91 is still a minimizer ) .",
    "such type of regularity approaches the optimal exponent in  @xcite as  @xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless , as  @xmath64 , minimizers in  @xcite are known to be lipschitz continuous , therefore we think that it is a very interesting open problem to investigate the optimal regularity of  @xmath80 in theorem  [ cc67 ] ( we stress that this optimal regularity may well approach the lipschitz regularity and so `` beat the natural scaling of the problem '' ) .    also , we think it is very interesting to obtain optimal bounds on the dimension of the singular set in theorem  [ cc67 ] .",
    "it is also worth to observe that the minimizers in theorem  [ cc67 ] satisfy a nonlocal free boundary condition .",
    "namely , the normal jump  @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "this free boundary condition has been presented in formula  ( 1.6 ) of  @xcite .",
    "since  @xmath94 approaches the classical mean curvature as  @xmath64 and a constant as  @xmath66 ( see e.g.  @xcite and appendix  b of  @xcite ) , we remark that this nonlocal free boundary condition recovers the classical ones in  @xcite and in  @xcite as  @xmath64 , and as  @xmath66 , respectively .    in  @xcite , we consider the fully nonlocal case in which both the energy components become of nonlocal type , namely we replace   with the energy functional @xmath95 with  @xmath79 , @xmath56 , where the notation in   has been also used .    in this setting",
    ", we have :    [ 09ijzaxis][theorem 1.1 in  @xcite ] let  @xmath80 be a minimizer of   with  @xmath82 .",
    "assume that  @xmath96 in  @xmath97 and that @xmath98 then ,  @xmath83 is locally  @xmath99 and , for any  @xmath85 , @xmath100 for some  @xmath87 .",
    "we observe that the hlder exponent in theorem  [ 09ijzaxis ] recovers that of theorem  [ cc67 ] as  @xmath101 .",
    "once again , we think that it would be very interesting to investigate the optimal regularity of the minimizers in theorem  [ 09ijzaxis ] .",
    "also , theorem  [ 09ijzaxis ] has been established in the `` one - phase '' case , i.e. under the assumption that the minimizer has a sign .",
    "it would be very interesting to establish similar results in the `` two - phase '' case in which minimizers can change sign .",
    "it is worth to remark that the case in which minimizers change sign is conceptually harder in the nonlocal setting than in the local one , since the two phases interact between each other , thus producing additional energy contributions which need to be carefully taken into account .",
    "in  @xcite a new class of free boundary problems has been considered , by taking into account `` nonlinear energy superpositions '' . namely , differently than in  , the total energy functional considered in  @xcite",
    "is of the form @xmath102 for a suitable function  @xmath103 .",
    "when  @xmath103 is linear , the energy functional in   boils down to its `` linear counterpart '' given in  , but for a nonlinear function  @xmath103 the minimizers of the energy functional in   may exhibit[multiblock footnote omitted ] interesting differences with respect to the classical case .",
    "a detailed analysis of free boundary problems as in   is given in  @xcite .",
    "here , we summarize some of the results obtained ( we give here simpler statements , referring to  @xcite for more general results ) .",
    "we take  @xmath104 to be monotone , nondecreasing , lower semicontinuous and coercive  in the sense that @xmath105 we will also use the notation of writing  @xmath65 for every  @xmath106 $ ] , with the convention that    * when  @xmath56 , @xmath65 is the nonlocal perimeter defined in  ; * when  @xmath107 , @xmath65 is the classical perimeter ; * when  @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "then , in the spirit of  , we consider energy functionals of the form @xmath110 notice that , for  @xmath56 and  @xmath111 , the energy in   reduces to that in  .",
    "similarly , for  @xmath108 and  @xmath107 , the energy in   boils down to those in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    when  @xmath108 , a particularly interesting case of nonlinearity is given by  @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , in this case , the interfacial energy depends on the @xmath47-dimensional lebesgue measure , but it scales like an @xmath55-dimensional surface measure ( also , by isoperimetric inequality , the energy levels of the functional in  @xcite are above those in  ) .",
    "we point out that the free boundary problems in   develop a sort of natural instability , in the sense that minimizers in a large ball , when restricted to smaller balls , may lose their minimizing properties .",
    "in fact , minimizers in large and small balls may be rather different from each other :    [ 890aj][theorem  1.1 in  @xcite ] there exist a nonlinearity  @xmath103 and radii  @xmath113 such that a minimizer for   in  @xmath114 is not a minimizer for   in  @xmath115 .",
    "the counterexample in theorem  [ 890aj ] , which clearly shows the lack [ ... ] let us assume ( see 3.1 ) @xmath116 '' .",
    "] of scaling invariance of the problem , is constructed by taking advantage of the different rates of scaling produced by a suitable nonlinear function  @xmath103 , chosen to be constant on an interval .",
    "namely , the `` saddle function '' in the plane @xmath117 is harmonic and therefore minimizes the dirichlet energy of  . in large balls , the interface of  @xmath118 ( as well as the ones of its competitors ) produces a contribution that lies in the constant part of  @xmath103 , thus reducing the minimization problem of   to the one coming from the dirichlet contribution , and so favoring  @xmath118 itself .",
    "viceversa , in small balls , the interface of  @xmath118 produces more ( possibly fractional ) perimeter than the one of the competitors whose positivity sets do not come to the origin , and this fact implies that  @xmath118 is not a minimizer in small balls .",
    "0.40     0.40     this argument , which is depicted in figures  [ ness ] ( a ) and ( b ) , is rigorously explained in section  3 of  @xcite .    in spite of this instability and of the lack of self - similar properties of the energy functional , some regularity results for minimizers of   still hold true , under appropriate assumptions on the nonlinearity  @xmath103 ( notice that , for  @xmath103 with a constant part , theorem  [ 890aj ] would produce the minimizer  @xmath118 whose free boundary is a singular cone , see figure  [ ness ] ( a ) , hence any regularity result on the free boundary has to rule out this possibility by a suitable assumption on  @xmath103 ) . in this sense , we have the following results :    [ 18ueyy23r ] [ corollary 1.4 and theorems 1.5 and 1.6 in  @xcite ] let  @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath103 be lipschitz continuous and strictly increasing .",
    "let  @xmath80 be a minimizer of   in  @xmath120 , with  @xmath121 on  @xmath122 , for some  @xmath123 .    then , @xmath124 . also , for any  @xmath125 , @xmath100 for some  @xmath87 .    for  @xmath108 ,",
    "a result similar to that in theorem  [ 18ueyy23r ] holds true , in the sense that  @xmath80 is lipschitz , see theorems  1.3 , 8.1 and  9.2 in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this case one obtains additional results , such as the nondegeneracy of the minimizers , the partial regularity of the free boundary and the full regularity in the plane :    [ 18ueyy23r : bis ] [ theorems 1.4 , 1.6 and 1.7 in  @xcite ] let  @xmath108 , @xmath103 be lipschitz continuous and strictly increasing .",
    "let  @xmath80 be a minimizer of   in  @xmath2 , with  @xmath82 ( in the measure theoretic sense ) .",
    "then , for any  @xmath126 , there exists  @xmath87 such that for any  @xmath127 for which  @xmath128 , it holds that @xmath129 also , @xmath130 is locally bmo , in the sense that @xmath131 for some  @xmath132 , where @xmath133 in addition  @xmath134 .    finally , if  @xmath135 , then  @xmath136 is made of continuously differentiable curves .",
    "the bmo - type regularity and the partial regularity of the free boundary in theorem  [ 18ueyy23r : bis ] rely in turn on some techniques developed in  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the case  @xmath108 recovers the classical problems in  @xcite after a blow - up :    [ 18ueyy23r : tris ] [ theorem 1.5 and proposition  10.1 in  @xcite ] let  @xmath108 , @xmath103 be lipschitz continuous and strictly increasing .",
    "let  @xmath80 be a minimizer of   in  @xmath2 , with  @xmath137 .",
    "for any  @xmath127 , let  @xmath138 .",
    "then , there exists the blow - up limit @xmath139 also , @xmath118 is continuous and with linear growth , and it is a minimizer of the functional @xmath140 where @xmath141    we stress that the energy functional in   coincides with that analyzed in the classical paper  @xcite . nevertheless , the `` scaling constant ''  @xmath142 in   depends on the original minimizer  @xmath80 , as prescribed by   ( only in the case of a linear  @xmath103 , we have that  @xmath142 is a structural constant independent of  @xmath80 ) .    the fact that geometric and physical quantities arising in this type of problem are not universal constants but depend on the minimizer itself is , in our opinion , an intriguing feature of this type of problems . in this sense , we recall that in  @xcite the free boundary condition coincides with the classical bernoulli s law , namely the normal jump  @xmath143 coincides with @xmath144 where  @xmath94 is the nonlocal mean curvature of the free boundary , as defined in   ( see formula  ( 1.12 ) in  @xcite and formulas  ( 1.13 ) and  ( 1.14 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that   recovers the classical cases in  @xcite when  @xmath145 and  @xmath103 is linear . on the other hand ,",
    "when  @xmath103 is not linear , the free boundary condition in   takes into account the global behavior of the free boundary and the ( possibly fractional ) perimeter of the minimizer in the whole of the domain . in this sense , this type of condition is `` self - driven '' , since it is influenced by the minimizer itself and not only by the environmental conditions and the structural constants .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss some recent results on the further connections between the alt - caffarelli problem and the minimal surfaces . more specifically , we consider the stationary points ( in particular minimizers ) of the functional @xmath146=\\int_\\omega|\\nabla u|^2+\\lambda^2\\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\ ] ] and the capillarity surfaces in the sphere of radius @xmath147 ( notice that the critical points of the functional in   are related to the system in  , see theorem  2.5 in  @xcite for details on this ) .",
    "we consider the functional @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 is a given constant , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is the characteristic function of @xmath154 , where @xmath155 here , the parameter  @xmath156 is the volume fraction of the droplet .",
    "we observe that the first term in @xmath158 is the energy due to the surface tension , the second term is the gravitational energy and the last term is the wetting energy which produces a contact angle @xmath159 such that @xmath160 ( see figure  [ 78534674325 ] ) .    by a taylor expansion , we see that @xmath161 hence , if  @xmath162 is the graph of a ( smooth ) function  @xmath163 ( with small gradient ) , we obtain the approximation @xmath164 in other words , the functional @xmath165 in   is the linearization of the sessile drop problem described by the functional  @xmath166 in  , with no gravity and constant wetting energy density .",
    "this suggests that there must be a strong link between the regularity of the minimizers of @xmath167 and the minimal surfaces .",
    "we will now discuss in which sense this link rigorously occurs .",
    "the first of such direct links was established in  @xcite , where it is showed that the singular axisymmetric critical point of @xmath165 is an energy minimizer in dimension 7 .",
    "this singular energy minimizer of the alt - caffarelli problem can be seen as the analog of the simons cone @xmath168 which is an example of a singular hypersurface of least perimeter in dimension  @xmath169 .",
    "the minimality of the simons cone was first proved by e. bombieri , e. de giorgi and e. giusti in  @xcite .",
    "the cones with non - negative mean curvature arise naturally in the blow - up procedure of the minimizer @xmath28 at a free boundary point . by weiss monotonicity formula ( see  @xcite ) , any blow - up limit @xmath118 of an energy minimizer of  @xmath165 is defined on @xmath170 and must be a homogeneous function of degree one .",
    "let us write @xmath171 where @xmath172 ( being  @xmath173 , as usual , the unit sphere in @xmath170 ) . since @xmath118 is also a global minimizer of  @xmath167 then it follows that @xmath174 in @xmath175 .",
    "rewriting the equation @xmath174 in polar coordinates we infer that  @xmath176 is a solution of the equation @xmath177 here @xmath178 is the laplace - beltrami operator on the sphere .",
    "we observe that @xmath179 if and only if @xmath151 and @xmath180 on the free boundary of @xmath118 which is a cone due to the homogeneity of @xmath118 .    equation   can be rewritten as @xmath181=0.\\ ] ] it is well - known that @xmath182 determined by the parameterization @xmath183 see @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have that @xmath11 and the sphere @xmath184 are perpendicular at the contact points , see  @xcite .    in this sense",
    ", one can interpret @xmath176 as the minkowski support function of the surface @xmath185 in other words @xmath186 and it is the distance of the tangent plane with normal @xmath59 from the origin .",
    "the previous discussion tells us that the sum of the principal radii of the surface @xmath11 is zero .",
    "indeed , let @xmath187 be the @xmath188th principal curvature of @xmath11 and @xmath189 the corresponding principal radius .",
    "then , in view of  , it holds that the matrix  @xmath190 has eigenvalues  @xmath191 , and so its trace is equal to  @xmath192 . from this and",
    ", we thus obtain that @xmath193 this is called the mean radius equation .",
    "recalling  , the free boundary condition given in  @xcite ( and corresponding to the constancy of  @xmath194 ) along  @xmath195 now becomes @xmath196 this means that the surface @xmath11 is contained in the sphere of radius @xmath147 .",
    "we point out that in dimension  @xmath135 formula   reduces to @xmath197 and therefore the mean curvature vanishes whenever the gauss curvature is nonzero ( i.e. , @xmath198 ) .",
    "if @xmath199 , then such simple interpretation is not possible .    in terms of the classification of global cones for the alt - caffarelli problem , we recall that the open question is whether for @xmath200 the stable solution of the mean radius equation in @xmath184 such that @xmath201 on @xmath180 is the disk passing through the origin ( when  @xmath135 , this question is settled in  @xcite , the case  @xmath202 was addressed in  @xcite and  @xmath203 was proved in  @xcite ) .",
