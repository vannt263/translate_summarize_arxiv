    "light constituents ( gluons , light quarks and antiquarks ) move in this external field .",
    "their motion is relativistic ; the number of gluons and light quark - antiquark pairs in this light cloud is undetermined and varying .",
    "therefore , there are no reasons to expect that a nonrelativistic potential quark model describes @xmath0 meson well enough ( in contrast to the @xmath2 meson , where the nonrelativistic two - particle picture gives a good starting point ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath3 baryon can be called the helium atom of qcd . unlike in atomic physics , where the hydrogen atom is much simpler than helium , @xmath0 and @xmath3 are equally difficult .",
    "both have a light cloud with a variable number of relativistic particles .",
    "the size of this cloud is the confinement radius @xmath4 ; its properties are determined by the large - distance nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the analogy with atomic physics can tell us a lot about hadrons with a heavy quark .",

    "@xmath0 mesons have identical `` hadro - chemical '' properties , despite the fact that @xmath1 quark is 3 times heavier than @xmath6 .",
    "the proton magnetic moment is of the order of the nuclear magneton @xmath7 , and is much smaller than the electron magnetic moment @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the energy difference between the states of the hydrogen atom with the total spins 0 and 1 ( hyperfine splitting ) is small ( of the order @xmath9 times the fine structure ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1 quark chromomagnetic moment is proportional to @xmath10 by dimensionality , and the hyperfine splitting between @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons is small ( proportional to @xmath10 ) . unlike in atomic physics ,",
    "both `` gross '' structure intervals and fine structure intervals are just some numbers times @xmath12 , because light components are relativistic ( a practical success of constituent quark models shows that these dimensionless numbers for fine splittings can be rather small , but they contain no small parameter ) .    in the limit @xmath13",
    ", the heavy quark spin does not interact with gluon field .",
    "therefore , it may be rotated at will , without changing physics .",
    "such rotations can transform @xmath0 and @xmath11 into each other ; they are degenerate and have identical properties in this limit .",
    "this heavy quark spin symmetry yields many useful relations among heavy - hadron form factors  @xcite . not only the orientation , but also the magnitude of the heavy quark spin is irrelevant in the infinite mass limit .",
    "we can switch off the heavy quark spin , making it spinless , without affecting physics .",
    "this trick considerably simplifies counting independent form factors , and we shall use it often . or , if we wish , we can make the heavy quark to have spin 1 ; it does not matter .",
    "this leads to a supersymmetry group called the superflavour symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it can be used to predict properties of hadrons containing a scalar or vector heavy quark .",
    "such quarks exist in some extensions of the standard model ( for example , supersymmetric or composite extensions ) .",
    "this idea can also be applied to baryons with two heavy quarks .",
    "they form a small - size bound state ( with the radius of order @xmath14 ) which has spin 0 or 1 and is antitriplet in colour . therefore ,",
    "these baryons are similar to mesons with a heavy antiquark having spin 0 or 1 .",
    "accuracy of this picture can not be high , because even the radius of the @xmath15 diquark is only a few times smaller than the confinement radius .",

    "the energy difference between these two @xmath25-wave states ( fine splitting ) is a constant times @xmath12 at @xmath13 , just like splittings between these @xmath25-wave states and the ground state ; however , this constant is likely to be small .    in our real world , the heavy antiquark @xmath28 has spin and parity @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum numbers of the above paragraph are those of the light fields cloud of a meson . adding the heavy antiquark spin , we obtain , in the limit @xmath13 , a degenerate doublet of @xmath23-wave mesons with spin and parity @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and two degenerate doublets of @xmath25-wave mesons , one with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the other with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . at a large but finite heavy - quark mass @xmath18",
    ", these doublets are not exactly degenerate .",
    "hyperfine splittings , equal to to some dimensionless numbers times @xmath36 , appear .",
    "it is natural to expect that hyperfine splittings in @xmath25-wave mesons are less than in the ground - state @xmath23-wave doublet , because the characteristic distance between the quarks is larger in the @xmath25-wave case .",
    "note that the @xmath33 mesons from the different doublets do nt differ from each other by any exactly conserving quantum numbers , and hence can mix .",
    "they differ by the angular momenta of the light fields , which is conserved up to @xmath37 corrections ; therefore , the mixing angle should be of order of @xmath38 .",

    "this gives the voloshin sum rule  @xcite and the bgsuv sum rule  @xcite : @xmath285 the transition into the ground - state meson with @xmath257 does not contribute here .",

    "the remaining sum is @xmath94  ( [ vol2 ] ) , and  @xcite @xmath292 ( at the second step , the inequality  ( [ vol3 ] ) was used ) . if the lowest resonances in the @xmath115 and @xmath27 channels with nearly equal energies dominate in  ( [ vol2 ] ) , ( [ bgsuv2 ] ) , then the inequalities  ( [ vol3 ] ) , ( [ bgsuv3 ] ) should be close to equalities .",
    "this is , probably , the case . strictly speaking",

    "this @xmath260 is small , and the bounds are very weak .",
    "however , the coupling of a soft pion with a heavy meson is small , and these states contribute little to the sum rules  ( [ vol2 ] ) , ( [ bgsuv2 ] ) .",

    ", the integral in the bjorken sum rule  ( [ bj ] ) logarithmically diverges at large @xmath254 , due to  ( [ pert ] ) .",
    "the integrals  ( [ vol ] ) , ( [ bgsuv ] ) diverge even more strongly .",
    "therefore , if we want to take @xmath294 effects into account , we have to cut these integrals somehow .",
    "on the other hand , the form factors @xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 depend on the normalization point @xmath298 , if perturbative effects are taken into consideration .",
    "it is natural to expect that the sum rules are valid , up to @xmath299 corrections , when @xmath298 is of the order of the cutoff energy ( this is discussed in  @xcite in more details ) .",
    "therefore , the anomalous dimension of the hqet heavy - heavy quark current ( which describes the @xmath298-dependence of the formfactors ) is proportional to the soft - photon radiation function  ( [ pert ] ) .    for more information about inclusive sum rules ,",
