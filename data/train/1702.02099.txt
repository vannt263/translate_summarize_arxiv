    "we find an excellent agreement between the results obtained using the fokker - planck approach and the non - linear langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "one challenge for future theoretical work is to include the coupling between the normal modes of the system during quench protocol and find a way to predict the resulting corrections to the scaling laws .",
