    "the spectra lack any indication of magnetospheric accretion ; the emission features can all be explained by wind scattering@xmath264 . these magnetospheric accretion features , including many strong optical emission lines , would be expected in an exor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although strong co overtone emission is typical of exors and often used to classify outbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but given other discrepancies , this diagnostic is insufficient to diagnose the outburst of asassn-15qi .",
    "the fast timescale could be explained by the lack of any magnetospheric cavity in the inner disk .",
    "although the leading explanation for exor events explains a buildup of mass in the inner disk through a large magnetospheric cavity @xcite , exor events could instead be triggered by disk instabilities at larger radii ( see suggestion by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the challenge for applying this interpretation to asassn-15qi is the lack of excess dust emission in the sed .    in principle , in an fuor the near - ir dust emission could be masked by strong emission from a hot , optically thick disk , as seen in the sed models of @xcite .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of @xmath258 l@xmath6 measured from the quiescent spectrum and sed would then be interpreted as disk emission .",
    "this luminosity would be extreme for normal disks but fainter than the @xmath265 l@xmath6 emitted from fuor disks @xcite .",
    "the b - star - like balmer jump seen in the asassn-15qi spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : speclo ] ) is present in other fuor outbursts @xcite .",
    "the lack of magnetospheric accretion signatures is also consistent with expectations for fuors , since the accretion rates are high enough to crush stellar magnetic fields .",
    "however , the 2015 outburst was an eruptive event with a near - instantaneous rise time and short decay , whereas fuor ( and exor ) outbursts are driven by changes in viscous disks on timescales of months - to - years . this challenge could be solved if the 2015 outburst occurred during a much longer fuor - like outburst .      in principle",
    ", the increased brightness could be caused by a decrease in the extinction .",
    "such a rapid change in extinction would likely be related to geometry , as seen in some young stars with disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than dust destruction",
    ". however , the spatially extended nebulosity brightens with the outburst , which demonstrates that the outburst was seen in multiple directions and not just our line of sight .",
    "an extinction scenario would require a dust shell that was cleared or destroyed on a @xmath266 d timescale , and then quickly reformed in our line of sight .",
    "moreover , the interstellar and dib absorption did not change between the two hires epochs , obtained 25 and 80 days after the outburst peak , which implies that the extinction is unchanged .",
    "therefore , the brightness increase is unlikely an extinction - clearing event .",
    "young planetary systems are thought to evolve through dynamical interactions between the planets .",
    "hot jupiters and super - earths that have been detected around more mature stars may arrive into their present positions by first being scattered into highly eccentric orbits . in some cases",

    "the rocky core of the planet might be able to survive passage through the atmosphere , so that the interaction would recur on an orbital timescale .",

    "these properties can not be easily explained in the framework of fuor and exor outbursts , which are usually applied to large brightness increases of young stars .",
    "however , other yso outbursts , including v899 mon and z cma , share some similar spectrosopic features as asassn-15qi .",
    "either fuor or exor events sometimes produce unexpected physical characteristics , or some protostars have outbursts that are triggered by different instabilities .",
    "if only sparse photometry and near - ir spectra were available , this outburst would have been classified as an exor .",
    "the outburst timescale and fast wind velocity suggests that the trigger occurred very close to the star .",
    "such an event may be related to mass transfer , interactions between a star and an eccentric planet , formation of an excretion disk , or by some magnetic reconnection and outflow event .",
    "we caution readers that we are also unable to rule out with complete confidence that the outbursts of asassn-15qi are produced in the test or use of advanced alien weaponry .",
