    "multiplexing represents one of the most prominent techniques used for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission systems @xcite . in general , both linear and non - linear ( e.g. , maximum likelihood ) detectors",
    "have been adopted in these systems . for computational savings at the receiver side ,",
    "there has been a prime interest in the class of linear detectors , such as zero - forcing ( zf ) and linear minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) .",
    "it is widely known that mmse outperforms zf , especially in moderately medium - to - high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regions , at the cost of a higher computational burden @xcite .",
    "this occurs because mmse computes the noise variance along with the channel estimates , in contrast to zf which processes only the channel estimates .",
    "thereby , mmse appropriately mitigates interference and noise , while zf cancels interference completely but enhances the noise power at the same time . on the other hand , a simplified non - linear",
    "yet capacity - efficient method is the successive interference cancellation ( sic ) .",
    "it is usually combined with zf or mmse to appropriately counterbalance performance and computational complexity @xcite .",
    "performance assessment of either zf- or mmse - sic has been extensively reported in the technical literature to date ( e.g. , see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , all the previous studies assumed perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver and/or a non - impaired hardware at the transceiver ; an ideal and a rather overoptimistic scenario for practical applications . more specifically , the hardware gear of wireless transceivers may be subject to impairments , such as i / q imbalance , phase noise , and high power amplifier non - linearities @xcite .",
    "these impairments are typically mitigated with the aid of certain compensation algorithms at the transceiver .",
    "nevertheless , inadequate compensation mainly due to the imperfect parameter estimation and/or time variation of the hardware characteristics may result to residual impairments , which are added to the transmitted / received signal @xcite .",
    "moreover , an erroneous csi may occur due to imperfect feedback signaling and/or rapid channel variations .",
    "it can cause crosstalk interference ( see @xcite and @xcite for explicit details on this effect ) within the sic process , while it can affect the detection ordering @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that an analytical performance assessment of zf- and/or mmse - sic under the aforementioned _ non - ideal _ communication setup ( i.e. , impaired hardware at the transceiver and imperfect csi ) has not been reported in the open technical literature so far .",
    "capitalizing on the above observations , current work presents a unified analytical performance study of zf- and mmse - sic for non - ideal transmission systems . the ideal ( traditional ) scenario is also considered as a special case .",
    "particularly , the ordered zf - sic scheme is considered , where the suboptimal yet computational efficient foschini ordering is adopted ( i.e. , strongest stream is detected first , while weakest stream is detected last , upon the zf equalization ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the norm - based foschini ordering requires only @xmath0 comparisons , with @xmath1 denoting the number of transmit antennas .",
    "this represents a remarkable computational gain over the optimal ordering , which operates over an exhaustive search of @xmath2 combinations .",
    "interestingly , it was recently demonstrated that foschini ordering coincides with the optimal one , in the case when the transmission rate is uniformly allocated among the transmitters @xcite .",
    "additionally , the scenario of mmse - sic with a fixed - ordering is analytically presented and studied , which can serve as a benchmark for the more sophisticated ordered mmse - sic scheme .",
    "the contributions of this work are summarized as follows :    * new closed - form expressions for the outage probability for both the ordered zf - sic and unordered mmse - sic schemes are derived .",
    "these expressions are reduced to the corresponding conventional outage probabilities , when ideal systems are assumed with perfect csi and without hardware impairments at the transceiver . *",
    "the well - known error propagation effect between consecutive sic steps is analyzed for the general scenario .",
    "relevant closed - form expressions are provided for some special cases of interest . *",
    "a new mmse linear filter is presented when the variances of noise , hardware impairments and imperfect csi are known .",
    "based on this filter , a substantial performance gain of mmse - sic over zf - sic is observed . * simplified expressions in the asymptotically high snr regime are obtained , revealing useful engineering insights , achievable diversity order and impact of non - ideal communication conditions to the overall system performance .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the system model is presented in detail .",
    "new analytical performance results with respect to the outage probability of zf- and mmse - sic are derived in sections iii and iv , respectively , while relevant asymptotic approximations are provided in section v. the error propagation effect is analyzed in section vi . moreover , numerical results are presented in section vii , while section viii concludes the paper .",

    ", zf - sic enables spatial multiplexing transmission , i.e. , it can distinguish the received streams from different users and/or antennas with the aid of spatial structures ( individual spatial signatures ) of the signals to be detected @xcite .",
    "it is performed in three main steps , namely , the _ symbol ordering _ that aims to enhance the overall reception performance , the _ interference nulling _ via zf from the yet - to - be detected symbols , and the _ interference cancellation _ from the already detected symbols .",
    "these steps are performed in a number of consecutive stages , until all given symbols are successfully decoded .",
    "the interference nulling can be efficiently implemented by applying the qr decomposition on a given channel matrix , which is widely adopted in zf equalizers , since it provides computational complexity savings @xcite .",
    "let @xmath64 be a @xmath65 unitary matrix ( with its columns representing the orthonormal zf nulling vectors ) and @xmath66 an @xmath67 upper triangular matrix , given @xmath58 .",
