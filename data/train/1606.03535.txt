    "characterizing the quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is of central significance to both condensed matter physics and quantum information science .",
    "exactly solvable quantum many - body models are benefit to demonstrate the concept and characteristic of qpts .",
    "recently , topological phases and phase transitions @xcite have attracted much attention in various physical contexts . in general , qpts are classified two types , characterized by topologically nontrivial properties in the hilbert space , and by the local order parameters associated with symmetry breaking , respectively .",
    "a topological state typically features a topological invariant , the chern number . in recent work @xcite",
    ", it turns out that the local order parameter and topological order parameter can coexist to characterize the quantum phase transitions .",
    "our aim is extending the result on the connection between the quantum phase diagram and geometric quantity to  more generalized systems , which are exactly solvable models of spin systems with a little complicated transverse field .",
    "the hamiltonians are hermitian and non - hermitian , depending on the magnetic field affecting the whole system . in both cases ,",
    "the conventional qpt occurring at zero temperature , i.e. , the groundstate energy density experiences a divergence @xcite , rather than the appearance of complex eigen energy @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate an one - dimensional transverse field ising model with additional periodically modulated real and complex fields .",
    "it is shown that both models can be mapped on a pseudo spin system in the @xmath0 space with the aid of an extended bogoliubov transformation .",
    "this allows us to introduce the geometric quantity , the chern number , to identify the nature of quantum phases .",
    "based on the exact solution , we find that the spatially modulated real and complex fields rearrange the phase boundaries from that of the ordinary ising model , which can be characterized by the chern numbers defined in the context of dirac and biorthonormal inner products , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ hamiltonian and solutions ] , we present the models and the solutions . in section [ chern numbers ] , we calculate the chern numbers in different quantum phases . section [ summary ] summarizes the results and explores its implications .    fig1",
    "we start our investigation by considering a ising ring with spatially modulated real and complex fields@xmath1where the external field @xmath2  can be either real or complex . for real field , we take @xmath3  ( @xmath4 )  for odd ( even ) @xmath5 , while complex field @xmath6  and @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath9  and @xmath10  being real numbers . here",
