    "modeling swarming behavior has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years . to model a flock of birds @xcite , a school of fish @xcite or the displacement of ants @xcite",
    ", a key question is to understand how to relate the collective behavior of large groups of agents to simple individual mechanisms @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , this question takes the form of the derivation of macroscopic equations from individual based models@xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the derivation of a macroscopic model for a new type of model of collective behavior where agents control their motion by changing the curvature of their trajectory .",
    "this model has been shown to provide the best fit of fish trajectories @xcite .    among models of collective displacements ,",
    "the so - called vicsek model has received a particular attention @xcite .",
    "this model describes the tendency of individuals to align with their congeners .",
    "many features of this model have been studied such as the existence of a critical point @xcite , the long time behavior@xcite or the derivation of a continuum model@xcite . due to its simplicity , several extensions or modifications of this model",
    "have been proposed , such as the cucker - smale model @xcite .",
    "there is also a variety of models which add an attraction and a repulsion rule to the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "however , the vicsek model has been proposed on phenomenological bases . by contrast , the experiments of @xcite have shown that the persistent turning walker ( ptw ) model provides the best fit to individual fish trajectories . in the ptw model , the individual controls its motion by acting on the curvature of its trajectory instead of acting on its velocity .",
    "however , in its version of @xcite , the ptw model only describes the evolution of a single individual .",
    "the model does not take into account the interactions between congeners .    in the present work ,",
    "interactions between individuals are introduced in the ptw model by means of an alignment rule , like in the vicsek model .",
    "the resulting model , called ptwa ( persistent turning walker with alignment ) describe how each individual is influenced by the average velocity of its surrounding neighbors . in the framework of the ptw model where individuals control their motion by acting of the curvature of their trajectory ,",
    "this influence must lead to a modification of this curvature .",
    "this contrasts with the vicsek model , where particles are directly modifying their velocity as a result of the interaction .",
    "the ptwa model is based on the assumption that the subjects use the time derivative of their trajectory curvature ( or of their acceleration ) as a control variable for planning their movement .",
    "such models are not commonplace in the literature .",
    "their first occurrence is , to the best or our knowledge , in @xcite .",
    "the present work is the first one in which interaction among the agents is taken into account within this kind of models ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that @xcite introduces the acceleration of neighbors in the rule updating the subjects velocities in a variant of the vicsek individual - based model @xcite but motion planning is eventually made by updating the velocity and not the acceleration .",
    "once the ptwa model is set up , the main task of the present paper is to derive the macroscopic limit of this new model .",
    "this macroscopic limit is intended to provide a simplified description of the system at large scales .",
    "the major problem for this derivation is that there is nothing like momentum or energy conservation in the ptwa model .",
    "such conservation laws are the corner stone of the classical theory of macroscopic limits in kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , as a consequence of this absence of conservation , the dimension of the manifold of local equilibria in the ptwa model is larger than the dimension of the space of collisional invariants .",
    "conservation laws are therefore missing for providing a closed set of equations for the macroscopic evolution of the parameters of the local equilibria .",
    "to overcome this problem , we use the notion of generalized collisional invariant introduced in @xcite .",
    "thanks to this new notion , a closed set of macroscopic equation for the ptwa model can be derived .",
    "the macroscopic model consists of a conservation equation for the local particle density and an evolution equation for the average velocity .",
    "the latter is constrained to be of unit norm .",
    "the resulting system is a non - conservative hyperbolic which shows similarities but also striking differences to the euler system of gas dynamics .",
    "it has also the same form as the previously derived macroscopic limit of the vicsek model ( also referred to as the vicsek hydrodynamic model ) in @xcite , but for the expression of the model coefficients .",
    "at the end of the paper , we propose a numerical method to compute the generalized collisional invariant out of which the coefficients of the macroscopic model are derived .",
    "the similarity between the vicsek hydrodynamics and the ptwa hydrodynamics can be better understood by considering the relations between the microscopic models .",
    "indeed , the vicsek model can be seen as a special limit of the ptwa model in a well - suited asymptotic limit .",
    "work is in progress to establish this connexion firmly .",
    "the inclusion of the alignment rule in the ptw model changes drastically the large scale dynamics of the system . without this alignment rule ,",
    "the ptw model exhibits a diffusive behavior at large scales @xcite .",
    "by contrast , when the alignment rule is included , the model becomes of hyperbolic type .",
    "therefore , the local alignment rule added to the ptw model generates convection at the macroscopic scale .    since the addition of the alignment rule modifies drastically the dynamics of the ptw model , it is also interesting to study the large scale effects of other types of local rules such as attraction - repulsion .",
    "the goal is to find a common framework for the large scale dynamics of a large class of swarming models .",
    "currently , there exist a profusion of individual based models , especially for fish behavior ( see @xcite for a short review ) . in a macroscopic model ,",
    "only the gross features of the microscopic model remain .",
    "therefore , the derivation of macroscopic models may be a tool to better capture the common features and differences between these different types of swarming models .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the ptwa model and the main result is stated .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proof of the derivation of the macroscopic limit of the ptwa model . in section 4",
    ", we study some properties of the so - obtained macroscopic model and we numerically estimate the involved coefficients .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we draw a conclusion of this work .",
    "the starting point is a model in which alignment interaction between agents is introduced inside the persistent turning walker model ( ptw ) @xcite .",
    "the ptw model is a model for individual displacements which has been derived to fit experimentally observed trajectories of fish .",
    "it supposes that individuals control their motion by acting of the curvature of their trajectory . to make it a realistic model for collective displacements ,",
    "the ptw model must be enriched by introducing inter - individual interactions . indeed , one of the main features of collective motion such as those observed in animal populations ( fish schools , mammalian herds , etc .",
    ") is the ability of individuals to coordinate with each other .",
    "observations suggest that trend to alignment is an important component of this interaction and leads to a powerful coordination - building mechanism by synchronizing the agent s velocities one to each other .",
    "one of the simplest models of alignment interaction is the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "this time - discrete model supposes that individuals move at constant speed and align to the average velocity of their neighbors ( up to a certain stochastic uncertainty ) at each time step .",
    "a time - continuous version of this dynamics has been derived in @xcite .    in order to combine the ptw displacement model and the vicsek alignment interaction model ( in the time - continuous framework of @xcite ) ,",
    "we propose the following model further referred to ad the ptwa model ( ptw model with alignment ) : among a population of @xmath0 agents , the motion of the @xmath1 individual is given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the position of the individual , @xmath6 is the direction of its velocity vector , with the angle @xmath7 $ ] measured from the @xmath8 direction , @xmath9 is the curvature of its trajectory and @xmath10 is a standard brownian motion ( with @xmath10 independent of @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity is constant and denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is a relaxation frequency and @xmath15 quantifies the intensity of the random perturbation of the curvature .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is the mean direction of the neighbors of the @xmath1 individual ( defined as the individuals @xmath17 which are at a distance less than @xmath18 from @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the perception distance of the individuals , supposed given ) .    the trend to alignment is modeled by the relaxation term of ( [ eq : kappa ] ) ( in factor of @xmath14 ) .",
    "it describes the relaxation of the trajectory curvature to the target curvature @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath21 is computed by taking the cross product , @xmath22 , the cross product @xmath23 is the scalar @xmath24 . ] of the direction of the individual @xmath25 and the mean direction of its neighbors @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath26 is the trajectory curvature the individual must achieve in order to align to its neighbors .",
    "it increases with increasing difference between the individual s velocity and the target velocity .",
    "@xmath27 is the typical value of the individuals trajectory curvature and can be seen as the comfort curvature .",
    "the larger @xmath27 is , the faster alignment occurs .",
    "the second term of ( [ eq : kappa ] ) ( in factor of @xmath15 ) is a random term which describes the tendency of individuals to desynchronize to their neighbors in order for instance , to explore their environment . at equilibrium ,",
    "these two antagonist effects lead to a stationary distribution of curvatures which is the building block of the construction of the macroscopic model .",
    "we illustrate this model in figure [ fig : fish_double ] . in the left figure ,",
    "a fish is represented turning to the left .",
    "however , its neighbors are moving towards the other direction ( @xmath28 is pointing to the right ) .",
    "then the fish is going to adjust its curvature in order to move towards the same direction as @xmath28 ( right figure ) .",
    "the adjustment of its curvature requires a certain time of order @xmath29 , after which the curvature @xmath30 is close to @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in this model , there is a time delay between the current acceleration of the fish ( @xmath30 ) and its desired acceleration ( @xmath31 ) . in most models describing animal behavior ,",
    "the dynamics is inspired by newton s second law : the acceleration of an individual is equal to a force term which incorporates all information about the environment . in the present model ,",
    "individuals need a certain time to adjust their acceleration .",
    "this rule can be seen as a modification of newton s second law saying that the force is proportional to the time derivative of the acceleration rather than to the acceleration itself .    )",
    "-([eq : kappa ] ) . on the left figure",
    ", a fish is turning to the left , while its neighbors are moving to the right ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "after a certain time of order @xmath29 , the fish adjusts its curvature in order to align its velocity with @xmath28 ( right figure ) . ]",
    "our goal is the study of model ( [ eq : x])-([eq : kappa ] ) at large time and space scales . for this purpose , it is convenient to introduce scaled variables .",
    "we use @xmath32 as space unit , @xmath33 as time unit , @xmath34 as curvature unit .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless time , space and curvature as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and for simplicity we omit the primes in the discussion below . in scaled variables , the ptwa model is given by ( for the @xmath1 individual ) : @xmath38 with @xmath21 defined by equation ( [ eq : kappa_bar]),([eq : omega_bar ] ) ( @xmath39 being replaced by @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 , @xmath42 given by : @xmath43      a first step consists in providing a mean - field description of the ptwa dynamics .",
    "introducing the probability density function of fish @xmath44 , we will prove formally that the ptwa model ( [ eq : position])-([eq : curvature ] ) leads to the following equation for @xmath45 : @xmath46 =    \\alpha^2 \\partial_{\\kappa}^2f,\\ ] ] with @xmath47 and @xmath48    the main concern of this paper is the study of the so - called hydrodynamic limit of the mean - field model ( [ eq : f ] ) . with this aim ,",
    "we perform a new rescaling and introduce the macroscopic variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 with @xmath52 a small number representing the ratio between the microscopic and the macroscopic time and space scales . in this paper",
    ", we give a formal proof that the density distribution of individuals in these new variables @xmath53 converges in the limit @xmath54 to the solutions of a hydrodynamic like model .",
    "more precisely , the theorem reads ( dropping the tildes for simplicity ) :    [ thm : formal_cvgnce ] in the limit @xmath54 , the distribution @xmath55 converges to an equilibrium : @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( resp . ) a von mises distribution and a gaussian distribution defined at ( [ eq : von ] ) and ( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "the density @xmath59 and the direction of the flux @xmath60 satisfy the following system : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are two positive constants defined later on at ( [ eq : c_1 ] )  ( [ eq : c_2 ] ) .",
    "the so - obtained macroscopic model ( [ eq : final_system ] ) has the same form as that derived from the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "indeed , the two models only differ by the values of their coefficients .",
    "this model is a hyperbolic system which bears some similarities with the euler system of isothermal compressible gases .",
    "there are however some striking differences .",
    "first , the convection speed of the density @xmath64 is different from the convection speed of the velocity @xmath65 ( @xmath66 in general ) .",
    "moreover , the velocity @xmath65 is a unit vector and therefore it satisfies the constraint @xmath67 .",
    "this explains why the pressure term is premultiplied by the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "this projection matrix guarantees that the resulting vector is orthogonal to @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , the constraint @xmath67 is preserved by the dynamics .",
    "however , the projection matrix leads to a non - conservative model which can not be put in conservative form . this intrinsic non - conservation feature is the macroscopic counterpart of the lack of momentum conservation at the microscopic level ( see below ) .",
    "the modification of the ptw model leading to the ptwa model has drastically changed the nature of the macroscopic model .",
    "indeed , the macroscopic limit of the ptw model without the incorporation of the interactions is of diffusive nature @xcite .",
    "by contrast , that of the ptwa model is of hyperbolic type . indeed , the scaling ( [ eq : macro_variables ] ) is of hydrodynamic type , the macroscopic time and space scales being of the same order of magnitude .",
    "by contrast , a diffusive scaling would have required @xmath69 instead ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity with the vicsek hydrodynamics also confirms that that the chosen interaction rule generates alignment since the ptwa model has the same macroscopic limit as the vicsek model . at the microscopic scale ,",
    "the ptwa and vicsek models look rather different , whereas , at the macroscopic scale , they are similar .",
    "this is an example of how the derivation of macroscopic model can be used as a tool to reduce and unify different types of swarming models in classes leading to similar macroscopic models .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the first step of the derivation of the macroscopic model , namely the derivation of the intermediate mean - field equation ( [ eq : f ] ) from the particle dynamics ( [ eq : position])-([eq : curvature ] ) . in order to derive this mean field equation ,",
    "we start by looking at the system without the white noise @xmath70 for a large ( but fixed ) number of individuals @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", the system reduces to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the solution of this system on a given time interval . following the standard methodology ( see e.g. the text book @xcite ) , we introduce the so - called empirical distribution @xmath72 given by : @xmath73 we can easily check that this density distribution satisfies the following equation ( weakly ) : @xmath74 = 0,\\ ] ] with @xmath75 and @xmath76 the term @xmath77 can be expressed using the empirical distribution @xmath72 : @xmath78 then it is clear that the formal limit @xmath79 of @xmath72 satisfies the following equation : @xmath80 = 0,\\ ] ] with @xmath81 given by ( [ eq : kappa_bar_kinetic]),([eq : theta_bar_kinetic ] ) .    when the white noise is added , the situation is more complicated . at the particle level ( [ eq : position])-([eq : curvature ] )",
    ", the system becomes a coupled system of stochastic differential equations .",
    "this implies that the empirical distribution @xmath72 given by ( [ eq : f_n ] ) becomes a stochastic measure . in this case ,",
    "formal considerations suggest that , in the limit @xmath79 , the distribution function @xmath45 satisfies the following fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : f ] ) with @xmath81 given by ( [ eq : kappa_bar_kinetic]),([eq : theta_bar_kinetic ] ) . for related questions ,",

    "this assumption translates the fact that in most biological system , each individual has only access to information about its close neighborhood . thanks to this assumption , we can replace the expression of @xmath87 by a local expression .",
    "this is precisely stated in the following lemma , the proof of which is obvious and omitted .",
