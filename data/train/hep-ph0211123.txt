    "various methods to determine @xmath0 at a lc exist and they have in common that a physical observable depends on @xmath0 :    * the pseudoscalar higgs boson , a , could be produced via radiation off a pair of b - quarks : @xmath6 the @xmath7 coupling is proportional to @xmath8 and thus the expected production rate is proportional to @xmath9 . * the @xmath10 rate from the pair - production of the heavier scalar , h , in association with the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath11 can be exploited .",
    "while the ha production rate is almost independent of @xmath8 the sensitivity occurs via the variation of the decay branching ratios with @xmath8 . * the value of @xmath8",
    "can also be determined from the h and a decay widths , which can be obtained from the previously described reaction .",
    "* the @xmath12 rate from charged higgs boson production can contribute to the determination of @xmath8 from the reaction @xmath13 because of the charged higgs boson branching ratio variation with @xmath0 .",
    "* in addition , the charged higgs boson total decay width depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental challenge of this study is the low expected production rate and the large irreducible background for a four - jet final state , as discussed in a previous simulation  @xcite . the expected background rate for a given @xmath15 signal efficiency is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ida2 ] . taking a working point of 10% efficiency",
    ", we estimate the statistical error in determining @xmath0 by @xmath16 resulting in an error on @xmath17 of @xmath18 . in the mssm ,",
    "the @xmath19 signal would essentially double the number of signal events and have exactly the same @xmath0 dependence , yielding @xmath20 for @xmath21 and the @xmath0 error would be about @xmath22 .",
    "systematic errors arising from interference with the @xmath23 reaction can be controlled  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath25 , @xmath26 decay to various allowed modes vary rapidly with @xmath0 in the mssm when @xmath0 is below 20 . consequently ,",
    "if these branching ratios can be measured accurately , @xmath0 can be determined with good precision in this range .",
    "as the h and a decay rates depend on the mssm parameters , two cases are considered . in scenario ( i ) , susy decays of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are kinematically forbidden .",
    "scenario ( ii ) is taken from  @xcite in which susy decays ( mainly to @xmath27 ) are allowed .",
    "we assume event selection criteria with an event selection efficiency of @xmath28 and negligible background , based on the expected b - tagging performance and kinematic event selection .",
    "the expected @xmath29 event rates and @xmath30 statistical bounds are shown in fig .",
    "[ hhhawidrate ] as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting bounds for @xmath0 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ hhhaonly ] ( right)formssmscenarios(i)and(ii ) .",
    "a previous ha simulation  @xcite indicates that about 25% of the time wrong jet - pairings are made , which are attributed to the wings of the mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath33 values from h and a decays are binned in a single distribution , since the h and a mass splitting is typically substantially smaller than the detector resolution of @xmath34 for the large @xmath0 values considered .",
    "our effective observable is the resolved average width defined by ^r_,=. [ gamr ] its dependence on @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ hhhaonly ] for @xmath35 in mssm scenario ( i ) and it is very similar for scenario ( ii ) .    in order to extract the implied @xmath0 bounds , we must account for the fact that the detector resolution will not be precisely determined .",
    "there will be a systematic uncertainty which we have estimated at 10% of @xmath36 , i.e. 0.5 gev .",
    "this systematic uncertainty considerably weakens our ability to determine @xmath0 at the lower values of @xmath0 for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 are smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "this systematic uncertainty should be carefully studied as part of future experimental analyses .",
    "figure  [ hhhaonly ] shows also the expected @xmath39 experimental errors based on the measurement of @xmath40 .",
    "an excellent determination of @xmath0 will be possible at high @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath41 and h / a width methods are nicely complementary in their @xmath0 coverage to the @xmath0 determination based on the @xmath29 rate method at lower @xmath0 .",
    "the reaction @xmath13 can be observed at a lc  @xcite and recent high - luminosity simulations  @xcite show that precision measurements can be performed .",
    "as soon as the charged higgs boson decay into @xmath43 is allowed this decay mode is dominant .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath44 varies significantly with @xmath8 , especially for small values of @xmath0 where the @xmath43 mode competes with the @xmath45 mode .",
    "the @xmath46 branching ratio and width are sensitive to @xmath0 in the form @xmath47 as in the previous section , we use hdecay  @xcite ( which incorporates the running of the b - quark mass ) to evaluate the charged higgs boson branching ratios and decay widths . the @xmath43 partial width and the corresponding branching ratio have a minimum in the vicinity of @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast to the variation of the branching ratio , the cross section for @xmath49 production is largely independent of @xmath8 .    our procedures for estimating errors for the @xmath12 rate and for the total width are similar to those given earlier for @xmath24 production rate and width in the @xmath50 channel .",
    "for @xmath51 at @xmath52 , a @xmath42 study  @xcite finds that the @xmath12 final state can be isolated with an efficiency of @xmath53 . for @xmath54 and @xmath31 ,",
    "we have adopted the same @xmath53 efficiency and negligible background .",
    "figure  [ hpmwidrate ] shows the resulting @xmath12 rates and @xmath30 bounds for mssm scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the corresponding bounds on @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ hpmonly ] ( right ) .    for the total width determination",
    ", we assume that we keep only 75% of the events after cuts ( a fraction @xmath55 of the raw event number ) , corresponding to throwing away wings of the mass peaks , and each @xmath12 event is counted twice since we can look at both the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 decay .",
    "we define a resolved width which incorporates the detector resolution @xmath58 : ^r_=. [ gamrhpm ] estimated errors are based on the width measurement for 10% systematic error in @xmath59 .",
    "the resolved width @xmath60 for scenario ( i ) is given in fig .",
    "[ hpmonly ] and it is very similar for scenario ( ii ) .",
    "it also shows resulting @xmath0 bounds . in comparison to the neutral higgs boson methods ( fig .",
    "[ hhhaonly ] ) , we observe that for mssm scenario ( i ) the @xmath12 rate measurement gives a @xmath0 determination that is quite competitive with that from @xmath61 production in the @xmath62 final state . for mssm scenario ( ii ) , the @xmath12 rate gives an even better @xmath0 determination than does the @xmath62 rate .",
    "on the other hand , the width measurement from the @xmath12 final state of @xmath63 production is much poorer than that from the @xmath62 final state of @xmath61 production .    by combining the @xmath0 errors from all processes in quadrature we obtain the expected net errors on @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ totalonly ] for mssm scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the higgs sector will provide an excellent determination of @xmath0 at small and large @xmath0 values . however , larger bounds are expected for moderate @xmath0 in scenario ( ii ) where susy decays of the @xmath64 are not significant .",
    "further information on @xmath0 could be obtained from the reaction @xmath65 , further higgs decay branching ratios ( e.g. @xmath66 particles ) , the h / a decay width from @xmath67 production , and the polarization of scalar taus .",
    "a high - luminosity linear @xmath68 collider will provide a precise measurement of the value of @xmath0 throughout most of the large possible @xmath8 range @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated the complementarity of employing : a ) the @xmath70 rate ; b ) the @xmath71 rate ; c ) the average @xmath72 total width from @xmath61 production ; d ) the @xmath73 rate ; and e ) the @xmath74 total width from @xmath75 production .",
    "experimental challenges will be the required high total luminosity , an excellent b - tagging performance , and precision detector resolution and selection efficiency determinations ."
