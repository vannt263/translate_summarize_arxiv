    "since the mid-1960 s , the standard method for analyzing globular cluster data has been a `` model - building '' approach ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one begins by postulating a functional form for the phase - space density @xmath4 and the gravitational potential @xmath5 ; often the two are linked via poisson s equation , i.e. the stars described by @xmath4 are assumed to contain all of the mass that contributes to @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath4 is then projected into observable space and its predictions compared with the data .",
    "if the discrepancies are significant , the model is rejected and another one is tried .",
    "if no combination of functions @xmath6 from the adopted family can be found that reproduce the data , one typically adds extra degrees of freedom until the fit is satisfactory .",
    "for instance , @xmath4 may be allowed to depend on a larger number of orbital integrals ( @xcite ) or the range of possible potentials may be increased by postulating additional populations of unseen stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has enjoyed considerable popularity , in part because it is computationally straightforward but also because ( as @xcite has emphasized ) globular cluster data are generally well fit by the standard models . but one never knows which of the assumptions underlying the models are adhered to by the real system and which are not .",
    "for instance , a deviation between the surface density profile of a globular cluster and the profile predicted by an isotropic model is sometimes taken as evidence that the real cluster is anisotropic .",
    "but it is equally possible that the adopted form for @xmath7 is simply in error , since by adjusting the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath8 one can reproduce any density profile without anisotropy . even including the additional constraint of a measured velocity dispersion profile",
    "does not greatly improve matters since it is always possible to trade off the mass distribution with the velocity anisotropy in such a way as to leave the observed dispersions unchanged ( @xcite ) .",
    "conclusions drawn from the model - building studies are hence very difficult to interpret ; they are valid only to the extent that the assumed functional forms for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are correct .",
    "these arguments suggest that it might be profitable to interpret kinematical data from globular clusters in an entirely different manner , placing much stronger demands on the data and making fewer ad hoc assumptions about @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "ideally , the unknown functions should be generated nonparametrically from the data .",
    "such an approach has rarely been tried in the past because of the inherent instability of the deprojection process . but",
    "techniques for dealing with ill - conditioned inverse problems are now well developed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the only thing standing in the way of a fully nonparametric recovery of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the limited size of most kinematical data sets .",
    "as we show here , the @xmath9 stellar velocities measured by coravel in   ( @xcite , paper i ) permit the dynamical inverse problem for this system to be solved with relatively few ad hoc assumptions .",
    "is a particularly good candidate for such a study since the two - body relaxation time @xmath10 is of order @xmath11 years even in its core , and @xmath10 exceeds a hubble time at the half - light radius ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus there is little justification for assuming that the dynamical state of   is well described by a model derived from the theory of stellar encounters .",
    "instead , we expect the structure of this cluster to reflect in large measure the details of its formation process , about which very little is known .",
    "the inverse - problem approach is also well suited to   since the coravel data extend , more or less uniformly , over the entire image of the cluster ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "our analysis will proceed by discrete steps , each of which takes us deeper into the dynamics though at the price of a progressively larger set of assumptions . as a first step we recover the rotational velocity field , assuming only that   is axisymmetric and edge - on .",
    "( the assumption that we lie in the equatorial plane of   is made throughout this paper , partly for reasons of mathematical convenience , but also because   is among the flattest of globular clusters and hence it is unlikely that we are viewing it from a direction far out of the equatorial plane . ) we next recover the two components @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the stellar velocity ellipsoid , after imposing dynamical equilibrium and assuming isotropy in the meridional plane , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "the latter assumption is the least restrictive one we can make which still allows us to uniquely recover the internal velocity dispersions from the observed ones .",
    "the two - dimensional gravitational potential and the mass density then follow without additional assumptions ; we emphasize that these are bona - fide dynamical estimates and are independent of any assumptions about the mass - to - light ratio or the stellar mass function .",
    "finally , we recover @xmath4 by assuming that the phase space density depends only on the orbital energy @xmath8 and angular momentum @xmath15  consistent with our previous assumption that @xmath14 , but slightly more restrictive in the sense that even three - integral @xmath4 s can be isotropic in the meridional plane . at no point",
    "do we write down ad hoc forms for any of the unknown functions ; the only restriction we impose is smoothness , enforced via penalty functions .",
    "details of the technique may be found below and in merritt ( 1996 ) .",
    "one advantage of analyzing the data in this way is that the conclusions drawn at every step are much easier to interpret than if @xmath4 and @xmath5 were written down at the outset .",
    "for instance , the dependence of the mean streaming velocity @xmath16 on position in the meridional plane follows immediately from the velocity data without any assumptions other than symmetry , and the uncertainties in our recovery of this function are due almost entirely to finite - sample fluctuations ( which we estimate via the bootstrap )  there are no biases like those that would result from the adoption of a rigid functional form for @xmath16 or @xmath4 . in the same way , our conclusions about the degree of velocity anisotropy in   are based on direct reconstruction of the velocity ellipsoid , and not merely on deviations of the density profile from the predictions of an ad hoc isotropic model .    by proceeding in this step - by - step way",
    ", we also preserve the important distinction between the `` knowability '' of different dynamical quantities .",
    "for instance , the phase - space density @xmath4 is related to the data by what is effectively a high - order differentiation , which means that recovery of @xmath4 from kinematical data will always be extremely ill - conditioned ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore proper to save the determination of @xmath4 until the last , after quantities that are more directly related to the data  like the rotational velocity field  have been derived .",
    "this distinction between well - determined and poorly - determined quantities is lost in the model - building approach , which begins by specifying @xmath4 and then treats all quantities that are derived from it on an equal footing .",
    "we find that   can be well described as an `` isotropic oblate rotator , '' i.e. a system in which the velocity residuals about the mean motions are approximately isotropic .",
    "our conclusion is stronger than one derived from the tensor virial theorem alone ( @xcite ) , since we are able to make statements about the detailed dependence of the velocity ellipsoid on position .",
    "we find in addition that the mass distribution in   is consistent with the luminosity distribution of the bright stars , and that the mass density normalization is consistent with that predicted by the virial theorem under the assumption that mass follows light .",
    "hence there is no compelling reason to postulate a population of unseen objects in this cluster .",
    "finally , we show that the velocity data are fully consistent with a two - integral stellar distribution function @xmath3 .    in  2",
    "we review the coravel data , which are described more fully in paper i , and briefly describe the penalized likelihood formalism that is used in the reconstruction of the dynamical quantities .",
    "the stellar density profile is derived in  3 ; the rotational velocity field in  4 ; and the velocity dispersions in  5 .",
    "dynamical estimates of the gravitational potential and the mass distribution are presented in  6 , and the stellar distribution function is derived in  7 .",
    " 8 sums up and discusses prospects for future work .",
    "the data on which this study is based are presented in paper i. the photoelectric spectrometer coravel ( @xcite ) was used to obtain 1701 radial velocity measurements of 483 bright stars , mostly giants and subgiants , of which 469 were later determined to be members .",
    "the typical measurement uncertainty is @xmath17 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the positions of the member stars are shown in figure 1 .",
    "previous analyses of various subsets of these data have been presented by meylan & mayor ( 1986 ) , meylan ( 1987 ) and meylan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we adopt cartesian coordinates @xmath18 on the plane of the sky ; @xmath19 is coincident with the isophotal minor axis of , as defined below , and @xmath20 increases westward .",
    "the coordinate parallel to the line of sight is then @xmath21 .",
    "we take minutes of arc as our units for @xmath20 and @xmath19 . adopting a heliocentric distance to   of 5.2 kpc ( @xcite )",
    ", we find @xmath22pc .",
    "the canonical `` core radius '' of   is @xmath23 pc ( @xcite ) ( although we show below that the brightness profile of   is consistent with a luminosity density that increases monotonically toward the center ) .",
    "the tidal radius @xmath24 is roughly @xmath25 pc ( @xcite ) . for comparison , the velocity data in paper i extend to about @xmath26 , or @xmath27 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we assume throughout most of this study that   is axisymmetric .",
    "cylindrical coordinates in the meridional plane are @xmath28 ; the @xmath29 axis is parallel to the @xmath19 axis , i.e. coincident with the isophotal minor axis .",
    "our treatment of the data will follow the nonparametric approach developed in an earlier series of papers ( @xcite , 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "one seeks a smooth function  call it @xmath30  such that the projection of @xmath30 into observable space is consistent with the data . for instance , @xmath30 might be the rotational velocity field in the meridional plane , to be determined from a set of measured positions and radial velocities .",
    "the standard technique for solving such inverse problems is to vary @xmath30 so as to minimize a functional like @xmath31 ^ 2 +   \\alpha p(g),\\ ] ] the `` penalized log likelihood '' ( @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath32 represents the projection operator that brings @xmath30 into observable space ; @xmath33 is the observed quantity ; @xmath34 is a measurement error ; and @xmath35 is a function that assigns a large penalty to noisy solutions .",
    "the penalty function is needed since direct deprojection of the data is generally ill - conditioned , leading to physically useless solutions ( @xcite ) . in the implementations presented here ,",
    "@xmath35 will depend on @xmath30 via its mean square second derivatives , a fairly standard choice ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of smoothness of the solution is then controlled by adjusting @xmath36 .",
    "one generally chooses @xmath36 to be as small as possible consistent with smoothness so as to avoid biasing the solution .",
    "implicit in this approach is the assumption that the observable quantities @xmath33 contain sufficient information to uniquely constrain the unknown functions @xmath30 .",
    "the requisite proofs for the axisymmetric inverse problem are presented in merritt ( 1996 ) .",
    "the first inverse problem to be solved is the derivation of the spatial luminosity density in , @xmath37 , as a function of position in the meridional plane , given measurements of the surface brightness @xmath38 on the plane of the sky .",
    "ideally we would adopt for @xmath39 the density of stars that comprise our kinematical sample , computed via a penalized - likelihood scheme ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the velocity sample was not specifically chosen to be magnitude - limited ( see paper i ) , nor is it as large as one would like for the nonparametric reconstruction of @xmath40 .",
    "instead we follow the practice of meylan ( 1987 ) and use surface brightness determinations from a number of other sources .",
    "these include centered aperture photometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and drift scan measurements ( @xcite ) in the central regions , and star counts ( @xcite ) in the outer regions .",
    "the normalized surface brightness measurements and their estimated errors are presented in table 1 of meylan ( 1987 ) at 44 distinct radii @xmath41 .",
    "the studies from which these measurements were taken generally ignored the noncircular shape of , and so the radii tabulated by meylan ( 1987 ) and used here should be viewed as approximate averages over position angle .",
    "is however significantly flattened .",
    "geyer , hopp & nelles ( 1983 ) measured the isophotal ellipticity @xmath42 as a function of radius between @xmath43 and @xmath44 via photographic photometry .",
    "they found a mean ellipticity of @xmath45 ; however @xmath34 varies significantly with radius , from @xmath46 within @xmath47 to @xmath48 at @xmath49 , becoming rounder again at large radii .",
    "the position angle of the principal axis was not found to vary significantly with radius .",
    "geyer et al . do not quote a value for this angle , but white & shawl ( 1987 ) derive an orientation of 6@xmath50 east - from - north for the isophotal minor axis , and this value appears to be consistent with figure 1 from geyer et al .",
    "we will adopt the white & shawl orientation in what follows .",
    "ideally , one would carry out a full deprojection of the surface brightness data @xmath51 , measured at some set of points @xmath52 , to obtain an estimate of the space density @xmath37 .",
    "this inverse problem has a formally unique solution for any axisymmetric system that is viewed edge - on , even if its cross - section is not elliptical ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however no two - dimensional surface brightness data for   have been published .",
    "instead , we will assume that the density of stars in   is stratified on similar , concentric oblate spheroids of axis ratio @xmath53 , the average value found by geyer et al .",
    "( 1983 )  consistent with our assumption that the equatorial plane is parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the binned surface brightness measurements from table 1 of meylan ( 1987 ) are plotted in figure 2a .",
    "the solid line in that figure is an estimate of the surface brightness profile , defined as the function @xmath54 that minimizes the quantity @xmath55 ^ 2 +   \\alpha\\int \\left[{d^2(\\log\\sigma)\\over d(\\log   r)^2}\\right]^2 d\\log r. \\label{opt1}\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the estimated uncertainty in the surface brightness measurement @xmath57 at @xmath41 . the value of @xmath36 used to derive the profile of figure 2a was selected via the generalized cross - validation technique ( @xcite , ch .",
    "4 ) ; this value minimizes the estimated , integrated square error in @xmath54 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath58 may be defined as the abel inversion of the estimate @xmath54 : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is also an azimuthally - averaged mean radius .",
    "but deprojection has the property of amplifying the noise in the data , and we expect that the optimal value of @xmath36 to be applied to the surface brightness data when deriving @xmath40 will be larger than the optimal value for estimating @xmath39 itself ( e.g. @xcite , p. 132 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no generally - accepted criterion for selecting @xmath36 in cases like this ( @xcite , p. 105 ) . to produce the estimate of @xmath58 shown in figure 2b , we used a value of @xmath36 roughly three times the optimal value for estimation of @xmath61 .",
    "the 95% confidence bands in that figure were derived via the bootstrap ( @xcite , p. 71 ) , with a pointwise correction for bias ( as in @xcite , p. 259 ) .",
    "the stellar density profile @xmath58 is evidently very well determined by these data at all radii outside of @xmath62 .",
    "( for comparison , @xcite find @xmath63 for the   core radius . )",
    "however at smaller radii the density profile is poorly determined , due primarily to the amplification of uncertainties resulting from the deprojection .",
    "the profile of figure 2b actually has a power - law cusp , @xmath64 , inside of @xmath65 ; however the confidence bands are consistent with a wide range of slopes in this region , including even a profile that declines toward the center .",
    "henceforth we take as our estimate of the stellar number density @xmath66 , with @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 the function of figure 2b .",
    "almost all of the stars with measured velocities lie outside of the region where the uncertainties in @xmath40 are significant ; furthermore , the uncertainties in most of the quantities derived below will be affected much more by limitations in the kinematical sample than by errors in @xmath40 .",
    "hence we will ignore uncertainties in @xmath40 in what follows .",
    "next we wish to find the dependence of the mean azimuthal velocity @xmath16 on position in the meridional plane . as a first step ,",
    "we investigate the variation of the mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath69 over the image of .",

    "the function @xmath71 that minimizes ( [ opt2 ] ) is a so - called `` thin - plate smoothing spline '' ( @xcite , p. 30 ) .",
    "figure 3a shows the result ; the smoothing parameter @xmath36 was again chosen via generalized cross - validation . the rotational velocity field is approximately symmetric but shows what appears to be a systematic twist at large radii .    here",

    "has a substantial proper motion . feast , thackeray & wesselink ( 1961 ) note that the translation of a solid object produces an apparent rotation , since the projection of the space velocity along the line of sight is different at different points in the image .",
    "this `` perspective rotation '' results in a radial velocity increment @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the components of the cluster space velocity parallel to the @xmath20 and @xmath19 axes and @xmath78 is the distance to the cluster",
    ". curves of constant @xmath79 are straight lines of slope @xmath80 , and the apparent `` rotation axis '' is oriented at an angle @xmath81 measured clockwise from the @xmath19-axis . as a result of the perspective rotation , the cluster appears to rotate as a solid body , with the rotational velocity increasing linearly with radius .",
    "the proper motion of   has been determined by murray , jones & candy ( 1965 ) . corrected for differential galactic rotation ( cudworth 1994 ) , the components of the proper motion parallel to our @xmath20 and @xmath19 axes are @xmath82 using our adopted distance of 5.2 kpc and assuming an error in this number of @xmath83 10% , we find @xmath84 the resulting change in the radial velocity at point @xmath18 is @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 measured in minutes of arc from the cluster center .",
    "the amplitude of the effect is small but not negligible , exceeding 1 km s@xmath1 near the edge of our kinematical sample .",
    "the spurious `` rotation axis '' is oriented at 19 degrees west - from - north , or about 25 degrees in a clockwise direction from the isophotal minor axis . at points near the @xmath20 axis ,",
    "the sign of the induced radial velocity is opposite to that of the true , line - of - sight rotational velocity .",
    "thus the perspective rotation would be expected to induce a slight twist at large radii in the contours of constant mean radial velocity  and in just the direction observed in figure 3a .",
    "figure 4a shows the corrected rotational velocity field , computed by minimizing ( [ opt2 ] ) after removing the contribution of the perspective rotation to the measured velocities .",
    "the contours are now substantially more symmetric at large radii .",
    "the rotational velocity along the isophotal major axis , shown in figure 4c , has a peak value of about 7 km s@xmath1 at a radius of @xmath88 pc ; this profile is reasonably symmetric about the cluster minor axis .    if   were exactly axisymmetric , the kinematic minor axis would coincide with the isophotal minor axis .",
    "figure 4a shows that this is approximately true , although there still appears to be a separation of a few degrees between the axis of maximal apparent rotation and the isophotal major axis ( the @xmath20-axis in figure 4 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is probably not significant given the relatively small number of velocities that determine our estimate of the rotational velocity field , and given the likely error in white & shawl s ( 1987 ) determination of the minor axis .",
    "furthermore the proper motion adopted here might be in error , leading to an incorrect adjustment for the perspective rotation . in any case",
    ", we will continue to use the white & shawl estimate of the minor axis orientation in what follows .",
    "our next task is to recover @xmath89 , the mean rotational velocity in the meridional plane .",
    "this inverse problem has a formally unique solution if   is axially symmetric and edge - on ( @xcite ) .",
    "however because @xmath16 is related to the data via a deprojection , it will be intrinsically less well determined than @xmath70 .",
    "we seek the function @xmath90 that minimizes @xmath91 d\\varpi dz , \\label{opt3}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the line - of - sight projection operator @xmath93 equation ( [ proj3 ] ) assumes that the cluster is axially symmetric , and that the observer lies in the equatorial plane .",
    "we can decrease the noise in the estimate by assuming in addition that the rotational velocity field is symmetric about the equatorial plane , an assumption that makes dynamical sense and that is consistent with the appearance of the contours in figure 4 .",
    "one way to enforce this constraint is to reflect all of the data into one quadrant of the @xmath18 plane , with appropriate changes in the sign of @xmath73 .",
    "this procedure was found to give reasonable results , except that the estimate @xmath94 so produced had a discontinuous gradient along the @xmath95 and @xmath29 axes .",
    "physically more reasonable results were obtained by changing only the signs of the @xmath96 , and requiring ( via a set of linear constraints ) that the solution be symmetric about @xmath97 and zero along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the penalty function was then able to enforce nearly - zero @xmath29-derivatives on the equatorial plane , as desired .",
    "the corresponding , constrained optimization problem was solved via quadratic programming ( @xcite ) .",
    "various values were tried for the smoothing parameter ; figure 5 shows the result for one choice of @xmath36 judged nearly optimal .",
    "the contours of constant @xmath98 are remarkably similar in shape to those of the parametric model postulated by meylan & mayor ( 1986 ) , at least in the region near the center where the solution is strongly constrained by the data .",
    "as noted by them , the rotational velocity field is clearly not cylindrical ; instead , @xmath16 has a peak value of @xmath99 km s@xmath1 at about @xmath100 from the center in the equatorial plane , and falls off both with increasing @xmath95 and @xmath29 . in the region inside the peak ,",
    "the rotation is approximately solid - body .",
    "one would like to estimate the uncertainties associated with the solution presented in figure 5 .",
    "the error in @xmath98 can be broken into two parts : the `` variance , '' i.e. the mean square fluctuation resulting from the finite sample size and measurement errors ; and the `` bias , '' the systematic deviation of the solution from the true @xmath16 ( e.g. @xcite , p. 29 ) .",
    "the variance is possible to estimate via the bootstrap , by generating a large number of pseudo data sets from the smooth solution and observing how greatly the estimates of @xmath16 fluctuate from sample to sample .",
    "the bias is a tougher nut to crack .",
    "while the techniques used here are ( unlike parametric methods ) unbiased in the limit of large sample sizes , for finite samples the smoothing will introduce a systematic deviation of the solution from the true @xmath16 .",
    "the situation is complicated still more by the fact that the amplitude of the variance depends ( inversely ) on the amount of smoothing , and hence on the bias .",
    "thus a too - large choice for @xmath36 will artificially reduce the variance that would otherwise be expected from a sample of a given size .",
    "( exactly the same is true for a histogram ",
    "the @xmath101 uncertainty associated with any bin depends on the bin width , i.e. on the degree of smoothing . )",
    "we nevertheless constructed formal confidence bands on our estimate of @xmath16 according to the following scheme ( @xcite , p. 71 ) .",
    "we emphasize that intervals constructed in this way are confidence intervals for the _ estimate _ @xmath98 and not for the true function @xmath16 , and do not reflect the error due to the bias .",
    "we expect the latter to be greatest at large radii , where the data constrain the solution the least .",
    "compute a smooth estimate of @xmath16 ; in our case , this estimate is the function plotted in figure 5 .",

    "generate a large number @xmath104 of pseudo data sets @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a random number from the normal distribution @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is an estimate of the variance of the measured velocities about their mean value at @xmath103 .",
    "this variance was set equal to the square of the estimated velocity dispersion displayed in figure 4b .",
    "( measurement errors in the @xmath73 are of order 1 km s@xmath1 and are negligible compared to the intrinsic velocity dispersion . )    \\4 . for",
    "each of these pseudo data sets , compute a new estimate of @xmath16 and record the values at each point on the solution grid .",
    "the @xmath109 confidence intervals at any point on the grid are given by the @xmath110th and @xmath111th values from the distribution of estimates @xmath98 at that point .",
    "since the pseudo data are generated from the smoothed estimate @xmath98 , which is biased , the estimates generated from the pseudo data will be `` doubly '' biased .",
    "one can compute the bias between the original estimate and the bootstrap estimates and then subtract it from the computed confidence bands ( e.g. @xcite , p. 259 ) .",
    "this ( slightly ad hoc ) procedure yields confidence bands that are correctly situated with respect to the original estimate , rather than with respect to the average of the bootstrap estimates .",
    "figure 6 gives 95% confidence intervals so constructed on @xmath112 , along two lines in the meridional plane : as a function of @xmath95 at @xmath97 , and as a function of @xmath29 at the value of @xmath95 corresponding to peak rotation in the equatorial plane .",
    "the confidence intervals on @xmath98 are wide , partly a consequence of the fact that relatively little of the motion in   is ordered .",
    "the peak rotational velocity is @xmath113 km s@xmath1 @xmath114 .",
    "for comparison , meylan & mayor ( 1986 ) , using an ad hoc parametric form for @xmath16 , derived a peak value of @xmath99 km s@xmath1 at @xmath115 , in excellent agreement with our result . outside @xmath116 , the confidence bands shown in figure 6 suggest that the form of the rotational velocity field is only weakly constrained by these data .",
    "we would like to compare our inferred rotational velocity field in   to the predictions of a theoretical model .",
    "however it is not clear that any relevant models exist . because of the long relaxation time in , the rotation probably still reflects to a large extent the state of the cluster shortly after its formation .",
    "our estimate of @xmath90 might therefore be most useful as a constraint on cluster formation models .",
    "a simpler question is whether   can be described as an `` isotropic oblate rotator '' ; that is , whether the distribution of velocity residuals about the mean motion are approximately the same in all directions .",
    "we will answer this question in the affirmative below , by showing that there is no evidence for a significant difference between the velocity dispersions parallel and perpendicular to the meridional plane .",
    "hence   can reasonably be described as `` rotationally flattened . ''",
    "meylan & mayor ( 1986 ) reached a similar conclusion after noting a strong correlation of the local rotational velocity with the isophotal flattening .",
    "we now wish to dig deeper into the dynamics and reconstruct the dependence of the velocity dispersions on position in the meridional plane .",

    "( 1995 , figure 1 ) present a circularly - symmetrized velocity dispersion profile derived from the same data used here .",
    "they note that the velocity dispersion rises sharply very near the center of , from @xmath121 km s@xmath1 at @xmath47 to @xmath123 km s@xmath1 within @xmath124 .",
    "this central value is derived from only 16 stars and has a formal ( @xmath125 ) uncertainty of @xmath126 km s@xmath1 ; thus the increase near the center may not be significant .",
    "we can mimic the effect of a fine radial grid like the one used in meylan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) by reducing the value of the smoothing parameter @xmath36 .",
    "we find that our estimate of the central dispersion rises as @xmath36 is reduced , and we can easily reproduce the meylan et al . value for @xmath127 if @xmath36 is chosen to be sufficiently small .",
    "however the velocity dispersion profile so produced is very noisy and almost certainly undersmoothed ; the high central dispersion has the appearance of a finite - sample fluctuation .",
    "we conclude that there is no secure case to be made from the current data for a sharply - rising velocity dispersion within the inner minute of arc .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersions contain contributions from both @xmath12 and @xmath128 ; @xmath129 does not contribute due to our assumption that the observer sits in the equatorial plane .",
    "if we assume in addition that @xmath130 , i.e. that the velocity ellipsoid is circular in the meridional plane , it becomes possible to infer both @xmath131 and @xmath132 independently from @xmath133 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of isotropy in the meridional plane is physically restrictive and one would like to avoid making it .",
    "however , allowing radial anisotropy adds _ two _ unknown functions to be determined from the data : @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which together with @xmath12 and @xmath13 define the 3-d shape and orientation of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the dynamical inverse problem under this less - restrictive set of assumptions has not been formulated but one would certainly need much more data than are currently available in   in order to find a unique solution .",
    "this issue is discussed at greater length in  8 .    following the scheme in merritt ( 1996 )",

    "this is again a quadratic programming problem .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the vertical gradients of @xmath144 and @xmath145 were forced to be zero along the @xmath146axis .",
    "there are obvious differences between the contour shapes for @xmath144 and @xmath145 , though both functions are reasonably symmetric .",
    "we would again like to know which of the details of figure 7 are securely implied by the data and which are due to finite - sample fluctuations . perhaps the most interesting question here is the value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath147 , the degree to which the azimuthal and meridional dispersions differ . figures 8 and 9 give estimates of @xmath148 , @xmath13 and @xmath149 on the major and minor axes , along with 95% bootstrap confidence bands . although @xmath145 is less than @xmath144 at most radii , the confidence bands are wide and there is no clear indication of anisotropy anywhere in the meridional plane .",
    "near the center , @xmath13 could be as small as 60% of @xmath148 or as large as 1.4@xmath148 ( 95% ) .",
    "the formal 95% confidence interval on @xmath150 is @xmath151 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that   is an `` isotropic oblate rotator , '' i.e. that the velocity residuals about the mean motion are isotropically distributed everywhere .",
    "however we emphasize the uncertainties associated with this interpretation .",
    "we have ruled out radial anisotropies by fiat , and even under this restrictive assumption , the confidence bands on @xmath144 and @xmath145 are quite wide . clearly , a somewhat larger kinematical sample than ours would be needed to place reasonably strong constraints on the degree of anisotropy in .",
    "meylan ( 1987 ) noted that anisotropic models from the michie - king family could be made to fit the surface brightness data for   only if the velocity ellipsoid was allowed to become significantly elongated outside of @xmath152 .",
    "meylan s result highlights the limited range of models from the michie - king ( or any similar ) family . in the absence of a priori information about the likely functional form of @xmath153 ,",
    "the surface brightness profile of a stellar system does not contain any useful information about the degree of velocity anisotropy . particularly in clusters like , where the collisional relaxation time is long",
    ", conclusions derived from comparison with collisional models should probably not be given much weight .",
    "having obtained estimates of the first and second velocity moments of the stellar distribution function , we can now construct dynamical estimates of the gravitational potential @xmath154 and the mass density @xmath155 .",
    "the former follows most directly from the jeans equation relating the vertical gradients in the stellar pressure to the vertical force : @xmath156 or @xmath157 we have again made use of our assumption that @xmath140 .",
    "the mass density follows from poisson s equation , @xmath158.\\ ] ] estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath159 so derived are bona - fide dynamical estimates ; they are independent of any assumptions about the relative distributions of mass and light , the stellar mass function , etc .",
    "however these estimates _ are _ dependent on our neglect of anisotropy in the meridional plane , a point that we return to below .",
    "figure 10 gives the bias - corrected estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath159 .",
    "also shown in figure 10 are the potential and mass distribution that   would have if @xmath159 were proportional to @xmath40 , i.e. if mass followed light .",
    "the total mass of   under the latter assumption follows immediately from the virial theorem ( appendix ; @xcite ) : it is @xmath160 , with @xmath161 the mean square line - of - sight velocity expressed in @xmath162 .",
    "the dynamically - inferred potential is slightly more elongated at large radii , @xmath163 , than the `` potential '' generated by the light .",
    "the differences between @xmath164 and @xmath165 are somewhat greater , due in part to the fact that @xmath166 is a second derivative of @xmath167 . the dependence of both functions on radius along the major axis and their confidence bands are shown in figure 11 .",
    "the dynamically inferred mass distribution is less centrally concentrated than the light distribution .",
    "however this difference is hardly significant given the width of the confidence bands on @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , we would expect the smoothing to reduce the degree of central concentration in the inferred mass , and our `` bias correction '' probably does not account fully for this systematic error .",
    "thus we are inclined to interpret figure 11 conservatively , i.e. to conclude that there is no evidence for a significant difference between the mass and light distributions in .    in any case , our formal , 95% confidence interval on the central mass density of   is @xmath169 .",
    "this is consistent with an estimate based on the `` core - fitting '' formula , @xmath170 ( @xcite ) . adopting @xmath171 pc and @xmath172 km s@xmath1",
    ", we find @xmath173 .",
    "this agreement is to be expected since the assumptions underlying the core - fitting formula  velocity anisotropy and a constant @xmath174  are consistent with our analysis of the   data .",
    "although we have failed to falsify the mass - follows - light model for , we stress that very different mass distributions are certain to be consistent with our limited data . by far the greatest uncertainty in estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath159 for hot stellar systems results from lack of knowledge about the radial elongation of the velocity ellipsoid . in a spherical system , allowing @xmath175 to have any physically permissible value leads to order - of - magnitude uncertainties in the total mass or the central density as derived from the velocity dispersion profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same is likely to be true in axisymmetric systems , with the role of the radial anisotropy played by the elongation of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane .",
    "if the velocity ellipsoid became radially elongated at large radii , for instance , the inferred mass density profile would be less centrally concentrated than what we found assuming @xmath14 .",
    "possible routes for overcoming this indeterminacy are discussed in  8 .",
    "our final step is to estimate the formally unique , two - integral distribution function @xmath3 that generates the inferred stellar number density @xmath165 and rotational velocity field @xmath90 in the inferred potential @xmath176 .",
    "we are justified in expressing @xmath4 as a function of only two integrals since any @xmath3 implies a velocity ellipsoid that is isotropic in the meridional plane , consistent with our assumption that @xmath14 .",
    "however there also exist three - integral @xmath177 with this property and so the distribution function that we derive here is not strictly unique even given our restrictive assumption about the kinematics .",
    "our goal is simply to show that a non - negative , two - integral @xmath4 exists that is consistent with our estimates of @xmath40 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 .",
    "the precise functional form of @xmath3 is of less interest , for two reasons .",
    "first , we have already derived the lowest - order moments of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath178 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath4 itself tells us relatively little that we do not already know .",
    "second , like the mass density @xmath159 , @xmath4 is related to the data via a high - order differentiation and hence its derivation is extremely ill - conditioned .",
    "we expect that many different expressions for @xmath3  obtained with different smoothing parameters , or different penalty functions , etc .  will be almost equivalent in terms of their ability to reproduce the input functions @xmath68 and @xmath98 and in fact we found this to be the case .",
    "figure 12 nevertheless shows estimates of the even and odd parts of @xmath4 : @xmath179,\\ ] ] the former derived from @xmath180 and the latter from @xmath98 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates were constrained to be everywhere positive .",
    "the positivity constraint did not preclude the inferred @xmath177 from reproducing the input functions with high accuracy , and we infer from this that   can in fact be well described by a two - integral @xmath4 .",
    "our principle conclusions are summarized here .",
    "the rotational velocity field in   is consistent with axisymmetry , once a correction is made for `` perspective rotation '' resulting from the cluster s proper motion .",
    "the rotation is strongly non - cylindrical , with a peak rotation speed of @xmath181 km s@xmath1 ( 95% ) at a distance of @xmath2 pc from the cluster center in the equatorial plane .",
    "the rotation is approximately solid - body at small radii ; at large radii , the available data do not strongly constrain the form of the rotational velocity field .    \\2 . by assuming that the residual velocities are isotropic in the meridional plane , @xmath140 , we derived the dependence of the two independent velocity dispersions @xmath148 and @xmath13 on position in the meridional plane .",
    "the central velocity dispersion parallel to the meridional plane is @xmath182 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there is no evidence for significant anisotropy anywhere in .",
    "thus , this cluster can reasonably be described as an `` isotropic oblate rotator . ''",
    "the gravitational potential and mass distribution in   are consistent with the predictions of a model in which the mass is distributed in the same way as the bright stars .",
    "the central mass density is @xmath183 .",
    "however this result may be strongly dependent on our assumption that the velocity ellipsoid is isotropic in the meridional plane .",
    "our method is based on the smallest set of assumptions that permit formally unique estimates of the first and second moments of the stellar velocity distribution in an edge - on , axisymmetric cluster , given observed values of these moments on the plane of the sky .",
    "the deprojection of the line - of - sight velocity dispersions can be carried out only if the velocity dispersions in the meridional plane are reducible to a single function of position @xmath131 , rather than the three functions @xmath184 that characterize a fully general axisymmetric system .",
    "while there are many possible choices for the relation between these three functions , setting @xmath185 and @xmath14 as we do is the only choice consistent with a general two - integral distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , some of our results  particularly the form of the mass distribution  might be strongly dependent on our neglect of velocity anisotropy in the meridional plane .",
    "future work on   should therefore be directed toward obtaining enough kinematical data to independently constrain the functions @xmath12 , @xmath129 and @xmath186 .",
    "one route would be to measure velocity dispersions parallel to the plane of the sky from internal proper motions .",
    "proper motion velocity dispersions have in fact been measured in a few globular clusters ( e.g. m13 , @xcite ; m3 , @xcite ) . in a spherical system ,",
    "such data allow one to infer the velocity anisotropy as a function of radius ( @xcite ) , and this technique has been used to constrain the mass distribution in m13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding existence proof has yet to be carried out for axisymmetric systems , but we note that proper motion velocity dispersions would contribute two new functions of two variables @xmath187 , which might provide just enough information to uniquely constrain the two unknown functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "alternatively , one could try to obtain much larger samples of radial velocities in , of order @xmath188 , which would permit the derivation of the full line - of - sight velocity distribution @xmath189 at a discrete number of positions in the image of the cluster .",
    "in fact the radial velocities of approximately @xmath190 stars in the core of   have already been measured using the rutgers fabry - prot interferometer ( @xcite ) , and line - of - sight velocity distributions for these stars have been presented by merritt ( 1997 ) . an observational program directed toward measuring a similar number of radial velocities at larger radii in   is currently nearing completion ( @xcite ) . here",
    "again , we lack a rigorous theoretical understanding of precisely what dynamical information are contained in the function @xmath189 .",
    "however numerical experiments in the spherical geometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that line - of - sight velocity distributions , like proper motions , contain considerable information about the velocity anisotropy .",
    "the kinematical sample analyzed here is large by the standards of just a few years ago , yet still small enough that the confidence intervals on many quantities of interest are still quite wide .",
    "we trust that this situation will be rectified in the very near future .",
    "the scalar virial theorem is @xmath191 , with @xmath192 the total kinetic energy and @xmath193 the potential energy .",
    "since we have assumed that the starlight , and hence the mass , is stratified on similar oblate spheroids , @xmath193 can be written @xmath194 ( @xcite ) where @xmath195 here @xmath159 is the mass density , stratified on surfaces of constant @xmath196 , and @xmath197 . using our adopted @xmath53 for omega centauri , and writing @xmath198 with @xmath199 the total mass , this becomes @xmath200 .",
    "we can evaluate @xmath201 using the number density profile derived in  3 ; the result is @xmath202 pc@xmath1 , assuming a distance to omega centauri of 5.2 kpc .",
    "the total kinetic energy is @xmath203 , where ( as above ) the @xmath29-axis is perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "the tensor virial theorem gives @xmath204 with @xmath205\\over   \\left[{\\sin^{-1}e\\over e } - { b\\over a}\\right ] } = 0.9010\\ ] ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath206 , with @xmath161 the ( mass weighted ) mean square line - of - sight velocity of the stars . equating @xmath207 and @xmath208 then gives @xmath209 where @xmath161 is measured in km s@xmath1 .",
    "this estimate of the mass is independent of any assumptions about the internal kinematics , though it is strongly dependent on the assumption that mass follows light .",
