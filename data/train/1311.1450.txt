    "comes a corresponding need to continue to better understand its properties , both as a function of @xmath15 and of @xmath16 .",
    "there is , of course , already much that has been established on this topic .",
    "for example , @xcite first studied inequalities on generalized hypergeometric functions and was the first to give upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , @xcite was concerned with computation of @xmath0 , and provided a way to produce rapid evaluations of ratios @xmath19 , and hence @xmath0 itself , through recursion .",
    "several other useful representations of @xmath0 are also provided in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , various convexity properties of @xmath0 have been studied in  @xcite and @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "motivated by results in finite elasticity , @xcite and  @xcite provide bounds on @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while @xcite provides bounds on the quantity @xmath23 $ ] arising in concentration of random vectors , as in  @xcite .",
    "motivated by applications in communication channels , @xcite develops bounds on the generalized marcum - q function , and the same author in @xcite develops estimates on the so - called turan - type inequalities @xmath24 . for an excellent review of modern results on @xmath0 and its counterpart @xmath25 , the modified bessel function of the second kind , we refer the reader to @xcite .    in our own ongoing work in the statistical analysis of networks ,",
    "the function @xmath0 has arisen as well , in a manner that  to the best of our knowledge  has yet to be encountered and addressed in the literature . specifically , in seeking to establish the probability distribution of the discrepancy between ( a ) the true number of edges in a network graph , and ( b ) the number of edges in a ` noisy ' version of that graph , one is faced with the task of analyzing the distribution of the difference of two sums of dependent binary random variables . under a certain asymptotic regime , it is reasonable to expect that each sum converge to a certain poisson random variable and , hence , their difference , to a so - called skellam distribution .",
    "the latter is the name for the probability distribution characterized by the difference of two independent poisson random variables and  notably  has a kernel defined in terms of @xmath0 @xcite for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one way to study the limiting behavior of our difference of sums is through stein s method @xcite . as part of such an analysis",

    "using current bounds on @xmath19 to lower and upper bound the infinite sum in @xmath30 in ( [ h def ] ) for @xmath2 necessitate the use of a geometric series - type argument , the resulting expressions of which both do not have this kind of behavior near @xmath31 . in particular , we show that such an approach , for @xmath31 , yields a lower bound that is order one and an upper bound that is order @xmath16 as @xmath7 .",
