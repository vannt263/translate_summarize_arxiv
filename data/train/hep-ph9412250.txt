    "recent experimental evidence from cdf @xcite as well as the global fit to lep data @xcite suggests that the top quark mass lies near the threshold for decay into a @xmath0 final state .",
    "decker , nowakowski , and pilaftsis ( dnp ) @xcite have presented numerical results for the decay @xmath5 .",
    "the dnp calculation treats the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons in the stable particle approximation . in light of the recent experimental data ,",
    "it is prudent to reexamine this decay , including the subsequent decays of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one expects , and indeed we find , that there are significant corrections to the stable particle result for the range of interesting top masses .",
    "unfortunately , because of strong phase space suppression , the rates are too small to be seen in the near future , even when the enhancement from the non - zero @xmath2 and @xmath3 widths is taken into account .",
    "thus , should this decay mode of the top be observed , it would signal physics beyond the standard model .",
    "another process discussed by dnp  @xcite is @xmath6 .",
    "we take this opportunity to re - examine this decay as well , including the width of the @xmath2 . as",
    "before , the rate is significantly enhanced near threshold , but not enough to render the mode visible .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the decay chain @xmath8 there are a total of nine feynman diagrams contributing to the desired final state in the standard model .",
    "the first three are the usual diagrams for @xmath9 where the @xmath10 and @xmath3 decay to the indicated final states .",
    "the next two diagrams involve radiation of the @xmath3 from one of the decay products of the @xmath10 .",
    "these diagrams are expected to be small in comparison to the first three , as all of the @xmath2 propagators they contain are far from mass shell .",
    "the final four diagrams involve replacing the @xmath3 by a photon .",
    "to reduce the contamination from the photon , we impose a cut on the invariant mass of the @xmath11 pair .",
    "this is a reasonable approach because experimentally such a cut would also be implemented .",
    "if we choose a cut of @xmath12 , we find that the contribution from the photon diagrams is typically less than 2% .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results we present below include all nine contributions .    because the @xmath13 mass is likely to lie near the threshold for @xmath14 production , it is important to include the finite widths of the @xmath10 and @xmath3 in the calculation .",
    "we take the propagator of a @xmath2-boson of momentum @xmath2 , mass @xmath15 , and width @xmath16 in the unitary gauge to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we use a similar expression for the @xmath3 propagator . note the presence of the complex mass in the longitudinal part of the propagator : it is required to preserve gauge invariance in the process @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , it is inconsistent to put a complex mass in the @xmath13-quark propagator unless the production process is included . we have found that a 1 gev shift in @xmath20 produces a shift of 10%15% in the rate for top masses just above the @xmath14 threshold .",
    "we have convolved our curve with a breit - wigner distribution in @xmath20 to simulate what one might find were production properly included , and see a change of only a few percent .",
    "hence , we exclude the width of the @xmath13 from our discussion .    in the case where both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay to the same lepton family , there are additional diagrams resulting from the interchange of the identical antifermions in the final state .",
    "we have checked the size of the interference term from these contributions and have found that it is generally small , ranging from about 6% for a top mass of 160 gev , to a percent or less above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "in addition to the full calculation described above , we have also obtained a `` narrow width '' approximation to the result .",
    "we define this approximation to consist of constraining the @xmath2 and @xmath3 invariant masses to their central values by introducing a delta function into the phase space integral .",
    "the result , when normalized to the appropriate branching ratios , should be the same at the stable particle result , except for ( small ) correction terms proportional to @xmath21 or @xmath22 . near threshold , this approximation differs from the full result as the contributions from that portion of phase space where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are off mass shell become important .",
    "below threshold in this approximation , the rate is identically zero .",
    "note that the cut on the invariant mass of the @xmath11 pair is irrelevant in this approximation . by examining the ratio of the full calculation to the narrow width result",
    ", we get a measure of the size of the enhancement for masses just above threshold .    in the discussion and plots that follow ,",
    "we define @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the experimental @xmath2 and @xmath3 branching ratios respectively  @xcite .",
    "we compare this quantity to the dominant decay mode of a heavy top quark in the standard model , which is @xmath26 .",
    "the rate for this decay is given by  @xcite @xmath27 \\cr\\noalign{\\vskip10pt } & & \\negthinspace\\negthinspace\\negthinspace\\times \\sqrt { \\bigl [ m_t^2-(m_w{+}m_b)^2 \\bigr ] \\thinspace \\bigl [ m_t^2-(m_w{-}m_b)^2 \\bigr ] } \\thinspace , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath29 is the ckm matrix element .",
    "the values we have used for the various masses , widths , coupling constants , and branching ratios are collected in table  [ parameters ] .    in figure",
    "[ wbzfixedcut ] , we have plotted the ratio @xmath30 for a top mass range of 140260 gev . note that @xmath29 cancels in this ratio .",
    "the solid ( dotted ) curve is the result of the full ( narrow width ) calculation .",
    "the large enhancement of the decay rate near threshold is clearly evident .",
    "some representative values for this ratio appear in table  [ zresultstable ] .    as has already been stated , the narrow width approximation normalized as indicated by eq .",
    "[ normalizedrate ] should reproduce the stable particle result , except for small corrections .",
    "we find , however , that our result is in disagreement with the dnp curve @xcite .",
    "in fact , the two curves do not even have the same shape .",
    "our result is larger by a factor of between 1.6 and 2 over the range @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , because we are in agreement with a concurrent , independent calculation by ellis  @xcite of @xmath32 in the stable particle approximation , we believe that our curve is indeed correct .",
    "figure  [ wbzvariablecut ] explores the effect of varying the value of the cut on the invariant mass of the @xmath3 decay products , for selected values of the top quark mass .",
    "as would be expected from simple phase space considerations , the effect of the photon is most visible for low top masses , especially below the @xmath0 threshold . in all cases ,",
    "the choice @xmath33 , which corresponds to just over seven widths below the @xmath3 peak , captures the vast majority of the @xmath3 events , while avoiding excessive background events from the photon .",
    "the second decay chain which we wish to consider is @xmath35 since the width of the standard model higgs is only about 5 mev for masses below the @xmath2-pair threshold , we do not include its width in our calculation .",
    "this is a much simpler process than  ( [ tbwz ] ) , as there are just four feynman diagrams in the standard model : the higgs may be attached to the @xmath13 , @xmath36 , @xmath2 , or @xmath37 .",
    "since we work in the approximation @xmath38 , only the first three of these diagrams actually contribute .",
    "although small , we retain the contribution from the @xmath39 vertex . defining @xmath40 and proceeding as before , we plot as fig .",
    "[ higgsplot ] the ratio @xmath41 in both the full and narrow width approximation , as a function of @xmath20 for selected higgs masses .",
    "the narrow width curves plotted here do indeed agree with the literature  @xcite .",
    "some selected values for this ratio are listed in table  [ higgstable ] .",
    "although the rates are somewhat more favorable in this case than for @xmath0 , provided @xmath42 , the difficulty in actually seeing the higgs associated with this decay makes observation of this mode in the near future unlikely .",
    "we have performed a calculation of the decays @xmath5 and @xmath43 including the subsequent decays of the gauge bosons . for the @xmath0 final state , we disagree with the existing stable particle calculation  @xcite well above threshold .",
    "we agree with the previously published results  @xcite for the @xmath44 final state in this limit . in both decays , we find a significant enhancement in the rate for interesting values of the top quark mass .",
    "this enhancement is not sufficient , however , to render either decay visible to the current generation of experiments .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observation of either decay would signal the existence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we would like to thank keith ellis for useful discussions .",
