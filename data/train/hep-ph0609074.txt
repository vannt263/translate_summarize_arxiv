    "the notion of the intrinsic charm ( ic ) content of the proton has been introduced over 25 years ago in refs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the light - cone fock space picture @xcite , it is natural to expect a five - quark state contribution , @xmath4 , to the proton wave function .",
    "this component can be generated by @xmath5 fluctuations inside the proton where the gluons are coupled to different valence quarks .",
    "the original concept of the charm density in the proton @xcite has nonperturbative nature since a five - quark contribution @xmath6 scales as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-quark mass @xcite .",
    "a decade ago another point of view on the charm content of the proton has been proposed in the framework of the variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) @xcite . within the vfns",
    ", the mass logarithms of the type @xmath10 are resummed through the all orders into a heavy quark density which evolves with @xmath11 according to the standard dglap evolution equation .",
    "hence this approach introduces the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the heavy quarks and changes the number of active flavors by one unit when a heavy quark threshold is crossed . note also that the charm density arises within the vfns perturbatively via the @xmath12 evolution .",
    "some recent developments concerning the vfns are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "presently , both nonperturbative ic and perturbative charm density are widely used for a phenomenological description of available data .",
    "( a recent review of the theory and experimental constraints on the charm quark distribution can be found in refs .",
    "in particular , practically all the recent versions of the cteq @xcite and mrst @xcite sets of pdfs are based on the vfn schemes and contain a charm density . at the same time",
    ", the key question remains open : how to measure the charm content of the proton ?",
    "the basic theoretical problem is that radiative corrections to the leading order ( lo ) predictions for the heavy quark production cross sections are large : they increase the born level results by approximately a factor of two at energies of the fixed target experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbative instability leads to a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters : @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and pdfs .",
    "for this reason , one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for the heavy flavor production cross sections @xcite .    at not very high energies ,",
    "the main reason for large nlo cross sections of heavy flavor production in @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath18 @xcite collisions is the so - called threshold ( or soft - gluon ) enhancement .",
    "this strong logarithmic enhancement has universal nature in the perturbation theory since it originates from incomplete cancellation of the soft and collinear singularities between the loop and the bremsstrahlung contributions .",
    "large leading and next - to - leading threshold logarithms can be resummed to all orders of perturbative expansion using the appropriate evolution equations @xcite .",
    "soft gluon resummation of the threshold sudakov logarithms indicates that the higher - order contributions to the heavy flavor production are also sizeable .",
    "( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since production cross sections are not perturbatively stable , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in pqcd .",
    "a nontrivial example of such an observable was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the azimuthal @xmath3 asymmetry in heavy quark photo- and leptoproduction has been analyzed . in particular , the born level results have been considered @xcite and the nlo soft - gluon corrections to the basic mechanism , photon - gluon fusion ( gf ) , have been calculated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross sections , the @xmath3 asymmetry in heavy flavor photo- and leptoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd : the contribution of the dominant gf mechanism to the asymmetry is stable , both parametrically and perturbatively .",
    "this fact provides the motivation for investigation of the photon-(heavy ) quark scattering ( qs ) contribution to the @xmath19-dependent lepton - hadron deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we calculate the azimuthal dependence of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath20 heavy - flavor - initiated contributions to dis . to our knowledge ,",
    "pqcd predictions for the @xmath21-dependent @xmath22 cross sections in the case of arbitrary values of the heavy quark mass @xmath8 and @xmath11 are not available in the literature .",
    "moreover , there is a confusion among the existing results for azimuth - independent @xmath23 cross sections .",
    "the nlo corrections to the @xmath19-independent lepton - quark dis have been calculated ( for the first time ) a long time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , and have been re - calculated recently in @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",

    "we disagree with this conclusion .",
    "it will be shown below that a correct interpretation of the notations for the production cross sections used in @xcite leads to a complete agreement between the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and present paper .    as to the @xmath21-dependent @xmath0 cross sections , our main result can be formulated as follows .",
    "contrary to the basic gf component , the qs mechanism is practically @xmath25-independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the qs contribution to the @xmath26 asymmetry is absent ( for the kinematic reason ) at lo and is negligibly small ( of the order of @xmath27 ) at nlo .",
    "this fact indicates that the azimuthal distributions in charm leptoproduction could be a good probe of the charm density in the proton . in detail",
    ", the possibility of measuring the charm content of the proton using the @xmath28 asymmetry will be investigated in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , azimuthal asymmetries in charm leptoproduction can , in principle , be measured in the compass experiment at cern , as well as in future studies at the proposed erhic @xcite and lhec @xcite colliders at bnl and cern , correspondingly .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ i ] , we derive the relations between the parton level semi - inclusive structure functions and the helicity @xmath0 cross sections in the case of arbitrary values of the heavy quark mass . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the presence of non - zero masses , it is the helicity basis that provides the simplest connections between the hadron- and parton - level production cross sections . in section  [ ii ]",

    "our calculations are compared with available results in section  [ iii ] . in section  [ iv ] , a numerical investigation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions caused by the qs contribution",
    "in particular , we provide a simple parton level proof of the fact that the qs mechanism is practically @xmath28-independent .",

    "in this section , the helicity formalism for the semi - inclusive @xmath23 cross sections in the case of arbitrary values of the heavy quark mass is presented .",
