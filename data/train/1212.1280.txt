    "this highly nonclassical behavior of thermal photons opens prospects towards the realization of thermal sources of single photons in circuit qed .",
    "this anomalous behavior originates from the tendency of the interacting quantum system towards vacuum degeneracy for large couplings .",
    "specifically for increasing coupling the energy of the first excited state converges towards that of the ground state , while the other energy levels remain well separated from that doublet ( see fig .",
    "hence , at sufficiently low temperature , only the first excited state is significantly populated by thermal noise ( @xmath44 is non - negligible only for @xmath45 ) . at the onset of vacuum degeneracy , the ground and first excited state are quantum superpositions with multi - photon components @xcite and naively one might expect to observe bunching effects .",
    "however such photons are mostly virtual and the use of generalized normal order correlation functions shows that the transition @xmath46 can only emit one physical photon at a time .     calculated with the same parameters as fig . [",

    "however a crossing between the second and third excited level occurs and beyond this point the cascaded decay @xmath69 is possible @xcite . for temperatures that are sufficiently high to appreciably populate these levels ,",
    "such cascaded decays can lead to pronounced bunching with @xmath50 , c.f .",
    "[ fig : g20 ] .",

    "we note here that a calculation of @xmath31 within the rwa and using the standard quantum optics me @xcite would always yield the value @xmath0 , regardless of the coupling strength and the temperature .",
    "while zero - delay correlation function can be directly inferred from the thermal density operator , a description of the time dependent dynamics of the open quantum system is required to calculate the time - delayed second order correlation function @xmath51 .",
    "a viable description of system - bath interactions typically requires an expansion in the system bath coupling . a suitable way to perform this perturbative expansion",
    "consists in writing the hamiltonian in the basis of its eigenstates @xmath74 @xcite . in this way",

    "the relaxation coefficients @xmath81 depend on the spectral density of the baths , @xmath82 , and the system - bath coupling strength , @xmath83 , at the respective transition frequency @xmath84 as well as on the transition coefficients @xmath85 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "@xmath86 is the thermal population at frequency @xmath87 and temperature @xmath5 . in all examples reported in this work ,",
    "we consider a cavity that couples to the momentum quadratures of fields in one - dimensional output waveguides , assuming that the spectral density @xmath82 is constant and @xmath88 .",
    "hence the relaxation coefficients reduce to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 are the standard damping rates .",
    "these assumptions correspond to typical experimental settings e.g. in circuit - qed . in the me ( [ eq : master - eq ] ) we neglect contributions of dephasing noise and lamb shifts as they do not affect significantly our findings .",
    "a first result worth mentioning is that the steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master - eq ] ) reproduces the thermal state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonical ] ) that is independent of the damping rates .",

    "notably , oscillations appear in the gray and green regions .",
    "these arise from interferences of the possible decay channels .",
    "in fact , for these values of the coupling strength , the separation between the energy levels is not high enough to suppress thermal occupation of higher excited states . hence decays from upper energy manifolds into lower excited states",
    "are possible . in this way , e.g. the third excited energy level can decay into the second or into the first , and interferences of these possible decays result in the observed oscillating behavior .",
    "this explanation is corroborated by the fact that the frequency of the oscillations corresponds exactly to @xmath93 , i.e. the energy difference between the first and the second excited state of @xmath24 . yet , in the blue region , @xmath51 is almost zero and behaves as for a usual tls , moreover the oscillations in @xmath94 are suppressed due to the low thermal noise and great separation between the energy eigenvalues . instead , in the red region",
    ", @xmath51 shows a slow decay for large @xmath94 which is due to the fact that the lifetime of an excitation in the state @xmath95 is a lot longer than of an excitation in the state @xmath96 .",
    "this difference in lifetimes is obvious from widths of the corresponding lines in the spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . hence after the emission of a photon from the decay @xmath97 , the probability of detecting a second photon that originates from the decay @xmath46 is substantial for a long delay range @xmath94 . for this reason , @xmath51 in the red region remains bunched for such a long time .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the spectral density of the bath that , being a linear function of the frequencies , tends to narrow the spectral linewidth of the lower resonances .",
    "deeper insights into the cascade processes involving transitions with different frequencies can be obtained from the frequency filtered second - order cross - correlation functions @xcite . here",
    "we calculate them for the circle - marker case considering the frequencies @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the time - ordering operator that positions the operators at earlier times on the outer places in the expectation value and @xmath102 with @xmath103 . for @xmath104 ,",
    "@xmath91 shows pronounced bunching due to the cascaded decay process @xmath105 . for @xmath106 on the other hand , @xmath91 is anti - bunched as after detecting a photon with frequency @xmath99 , the system needs to be re - excited before a photon at frequency @xmath98 can be emitted and detected @xcite .",
    "thermal emission is also characterized by its power spectrum , i.e. the fourier transform of the two time correlation @xmath107 .     and for @xmath92 .",
    "spectra heights are normalized by the maximum value of the lowest temperature spectrum ( square marker ) . ]",
    "we exploit again the quantum regression theorem to calculate the relevant two - time correlation function .",

    "[ fig : g2tau ] and the corresponding values of temperature and couplings for the different markers as introduced in the caption of fig .",

    "moreover the resonances have i ) different linewidths , as one can see from the definition of the damping rates and ii ) different heights .",
    "the latter is mainly a consequence of the thermal feeding .",
    "for a fixed temperature , the thermal occupation of a spectral resonance ( i.e. its height ) is determined by @xmath109 that increases as the frequency @xmath110 of the resonance decreases .",
    "the presence of two different decay times in the example with the dot marker becomes apparent via the different linewidths of the resonances contributing to the signal , see fig .",
