    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model @xcite is one of the simplest models which are relevant to many correlated electron phenomena including interaction - driven metal - insulator transitions @xcite , spin and charge density waves @xcite , magnetism @xcite and superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the ability to predict the properties of 2d hubbard model is crucial to our understanding of the related exotic quantum states and the transition between them .",
    "though the one dimensional hubbard model is exactly solvable @xcite , no exact solution for the hubbard model exists in two or higher dimensions except for a few special parameter values .",
    "the ground state property of the 2d hubbard model has been investigated by a variety of methods which have both strengths and weaknesses in different regions of the parameter space . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the 2d hubbard model was studied by state - of - the - art numerical methods @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we provide a detailed account of the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) study in ref .",
    "@xcite , introduce two methodological advances which improve the accuracy and efficiency of afqmc calculations , and present systematic results for finite - size supercells and detailed analysis of the scaling to the thermodynamic limit . because of the high accuracy of afqmc , the results in this paper will be able to serve as benchmarks for future calculations and method development .",
    "such benchmarks will be very valuable given the fundamental nature of the hubbard model .",
    "in addition to the detailed and systematic data , we propose here the use of a quasi - random sequence which reduces the fluctuations and accelerate convergence when implementing twist averaged boundary conditions ( tabc ) .",
    "we test this approach and study the convergence of different boundary conditions .",
    "the quasi - random twist is applicable to all many - body calculations of extended systems , including realistic electronic structure calculations in correlated materials .",
    "we also describe the use of generalized hartree - fock ( ghf ) trial wave functions over the more standard unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) form , and discuss how and when improvement in accuracy and efficiency results , both at half - filling and in the doped regime .",
    "the connection between the ghf form for magnetic correlations ( repulsive model , half - filling ) and the bcs form for superconducting order ( attractive , spin - balanced model ) is discussed , as well as their relation to the form of the many - body propagators and their symmetry properties .",
    "such wave functions can be readily generalized to other quantum monte carlo calculations in many - electron systems .    at half - filling in the repulsive hubbard model ,",
    "the result from afqmc is numerically exact and the method is computationally very efficient .",
    "away from half - filling , afqmc methods suffer from the minus sign problem @xcite associated with fermi statistics which leads to exponentially growing statistical errors with system size and inverse temperature .",
    "we employ the constrained path formalism under afqmc , commonly referred to as constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) , to control the sign problem by introducing a trial wave - function to guide the walk in the slater determinant space .",
    "this restores the algebraic computational scaling as in the half - filled case , but introduces a possible systematic error .",
    "the goal of considering different forms of the trial wave function is to minimize this error , and to improve the prefactor in the algebraic scaling .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model_method ] , we first define the hubbard model and give a brief summary of the method used in this work . we also introduce the use of twist boundary conditions in computations of finite supercells . in sec .",
    "[ method_new ] we describe the computational algorithmic advances .",
    "the use of a quasi - random sequence in the twist averaged boundary conditions is discussed , with test results presented .",
    "we also study the use of ghf trial wave functions and analyze their connection to bcs wave functions . the interplay between the form of the trial wave function and symmetry properties of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation",
    "is examined . in sec .",
    "[ results_half_filling ] we present detailed , exact numerical finite - size results at half - filling for a range of supercell sizes and boundary conditions , from weak to strong - coupling regimes . a careful finite - size scaling analysis",
    "is carried out to extrapolate the computed quantities to the thermodynamic limit . in sec .",
    "[ result_away_half - filling ] , the results for system away from half - filling are presented .",
    "a short summary in sec .  [ conclusion ] will conclude this paper .",
    "the appendix contain the finite size numerical data including ground state energy , double occupancy and kinetic energy .",
    "the hubbard model is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the kinetic and interaction terms , respectively .",
    "the creation ( annihilation ) operator on site @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , with @xmath13 the spin of the electron , and @xmath14 is the corresponding number operator .",
    "we denote the total number of electrons with up and down spin by @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this work ,",
    "we only consider the spin - balanced ( @xmath17 ) systems .",
    "the filling factor is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of lattice sites in the supercell .",
    "half - filling is @xmath20 , and away from it the hole density is given by @xmath21 .",
    "we deal with only nearest neighboring and uniform hopping , @xmath22 for each near - neighbor pair @xmath23 , and set @xmath24 as the energy unit .",
    "the strength of the repulsive interaction is given by @xmath0 .",
    "with the exception of the @xmath25 doping case where rectangular lattice are studied to accommodate the underlying spin density wave structure , we consider supercells of square lattice with size @xmath26 .    in order to better extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit ( tdl ) , we use tabc @xcite . as shown in sec .  [ results_half_filling ] ,",
    "the standard periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) turns out to give non - monotonic convergence with supercell size . under twist",
    "boundary conditions ( tbc ) , an electron gains a phase when hopping across the boundaries : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unit vector along @xmath29 , and the twist angle @xmath30 is a parameter , with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 .",
    "this is equivalent to placing the lattice on a torus topology and applying a magnetic field which induces a flux of @xmath31 along the @xmath34-direction ( and a flux of @xmath32 along the @xmath35-direction ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tbc ] ) , the translational symmetry is explicitly broken , but we can also choose another gauge with which the translational symmetry is preserved , i.e. , adjust @xmath24 to @xmath36 along @xmath34 and @xmath37 along @xmath35 . by imposing a random tbc , the possible degeneracy of the non - interacting energy levels is lifted by breaking the rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this eliminates the so called open - shell effects .    to implement tabc",
    ", we choose a set of @xmath38 twist angles and carry out the calculation for each separately .",
    "the constrained path condition can be generalized straightforwardly to the case of tbc @xcite .",
    "the computational cost is thus nominally @xmath38 times that of a single calculation for , say , the pbc .",
    "however , by averaging the same physical quantities from all the calculations , the statistical error bar of the tabc value of the given quantity is reduced . as will be discussed later",
    ", the associated statistical uncertainty can be estimated from the distribution among the twist angles . for non - interacting systems ,",
    "the tabc energy at half - filling approaches the exact tdl value as @xmath38 is increased . however",
    ", if the canonical ensemble is used with fixed particle number @xmath19 , the tabc result with @xmath39 is in general not equal to the tdl value @xcite .",
    "this is the case away from half - filling in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "( of course the discrepancy goes to zero as the system size @xmath19 is increased . )",
    "the use of tabc and the treatment of finite - size effects , including the effect from electron correlations , have been discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "the quasi - random sequence we discuss below can be directly applied in this framework . recently",
    "another method has been proposed to reduce the one - body finite - size effect in the hubbard model by modifying the energy levels of the free electron part of the hamiltonian in a way consistent with the corresponding one - particle density of states in the tdl @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen to treat the original hubbard hamiltonian , since part of our goal is to produce benchmark data for finite - size supercells .      in this section",
    ", we will briefly introduce the afqmc @xcite method .",

    "the trotter error can be eliminated by an extrapolation of @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "we typically choose @xmath50 in this work , with which we have verified that the trotter error is below the targeted statistical errors .",
    "we usually choose @xmath40 as a slater determinant in afqmc .",
    "the one - body term @xmath51 can be directly applied to it and the result is another slater determinant .",
    "this does not hold for the two - body term @xmath52 .",
    "however , we can decompose the two - body term into an integral of one - body terms through the so - called hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation .",
    "there exist different types of hs transformations for @xmath52 .",
    "the two commonly used types in the literature are the so called spin decomposition @xmath53 with the constant @xmath54 is determined by @xmath55 , and the charge decomposition @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath34 is an ising - spin - like auxiliary field .",
    "different choices of the hs can lead to different accuracies or efficiencies , because of symmetry considerations @xcite or other factors @xcite .",
    "we will further comment on the decompositions later .",
    "after the hs transformation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : expect_o ] ) turns into @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the collection of the @xmath19 auxiliary fields introduced by the hs transformation , and @xmath60 is the product of the kinetic term @xmath51 and the one - body terms from the hs transformation at time slice @xmath10 .",
    "the multi - dimensional integrals can then be computed by monte carlo methods , e.g. , with the metropolis algorithm .    at half - filling , the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : obs ] ) is always non - negative because of particle - hole symmetry@xcite .",

    "( [ eq : obs ] ) by monte carlo will suffer from the sign problem @xcite .",
    "the sign problem can be eliminated by the constrained path approximation .",

    "( [ mix_estimate ] ) is positive , we constrain the paths of auxiliary - fields so that the overlap with @xmath61 , computed at each time slice , remain non - negative .",
    "a description of the cpmc method for hubbard - like models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in cpmc",
    ", the wave function is represented as a linear combination of a set of slater determinants which are called walkers .",
    "the evolution of wave function in the imaginary time is represented as random walks in the slater determinant space by sampling the auxiliary field .",
    "physical quantities can be calculated using the mixed estimator as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64th walker , @xmath65 is the corresponding weight and @xmath66 is the trial wave - function we introduced .",
    "the mixed estimator is used to compute the energy ( and other observables which commute with the hamiltonian ) . for observables which do not commute with hamiltionian ,",
    "the mixed estimate is biased , and back propagation is applied to correct for this @xcite .    in order to remove the sign problem , the constrained path approximation in cpmc introduces a systematic error which depends on the trail wave - function @xmath61 . with the tbc ,",
    "a simple generalization of constraint can be made @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown the systematic error is small even with a free - electron or hartree - fork trial wave - function @xcite .",
    "we will further discuss the accuracy of cpmc and the role of the trial wave function below in secs .",
    "[ ssec : ghf ] and [ result_away_half - filling ] .",
    "to implement tabc , a set of twist angles need to be chosen .",
    "if we only consider how to minimize the one - body finite - size effect @xcite , the problem is related to the calculation of a two - dimensional quadrature . in this section ,",
    "we compare three choices of random twist angles , i.e. the pseudo random ( pr ) sequence , quasi random ( qr ) sequence and uniform grid .",
    "a quasi random sequence is also known as low - discrepancy sequence , which is a sequence with the property that for all values of @xmath19 , its subsequence @xmath67 has a low discrepancy .",
    "low discrepancy means the proportion of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set @xmath68 is close to proportional to the measure of @xmath68 .",
    "different from a pseudo random sequence , it fills the sampling space more uniformly at the price of losing some randomness . in this sense",
    ", a quasi random sequence is correlated .",
    "we choose the halton sequences@xcite to generate our twist angles in this work . in the uniform grid method ,",
    "the @xmath69 twist angles are set as @xmath70 where the integers @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for pseudo random twists ,",
    "we generate the twist @xmath73 by pseudo random number sequence .",
    "the pr and qr twists both have residual errors which are statistical , while the grid will have a systematic residual error .",
    "the errors vanish in the limit of a large number of twists , @xmath75 . from two - dimensional quadrature considerations",
    ", one would expect the convergence rate , i.e. , the residual error as a function of @xmath75 , should be @xmath76 for pr , qr , and the uniform grid , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ quasi_non - inter ] we show the convergence rates of the ground state energy of the non - interacting hubbard model ( @xmath77 ) for the @xmath78 lattice at half - filling .",
    "the results are consistent with the expectation above .",

    "[ quasi_inter ] ( a ) , we study an interacting case , with @xmath79 and a filling factor of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , again in a @xmath86 lattice .",
    "we use exact diagonalization ( ed ) to calculate the ground state energy for each twist angle .",
    "a total of @xmath87 twist angles are used in each method . to estimate the statistical error bar of the tabc energy for @xmath38 @xmath88 twist angles for qr and pr sequences , we partition all the data into blocks with size @xmath38 .",
    "the standard derivation of the average energies from the @xmath89 $ ] blocks then provides an estimate of the desired statistical error . for the uniform grid",
    ", we calculate the relative error for each grid size as the difference between its average and that of the entire @xmath90 twist angles . as in the non - interacting case shown in fig .",
    "[ quasi_non - inter ] , the tabc energy using qr sequence converges at a similar rate to that using uniform grid , with both showing faster convergence rate than the pr sequence .",

    "the slopes of the fit are @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively for qr sequence , pr sequence , and the uniform grid .",
    "these are consistent with the expected rate mentioned above .    in fig .",
    "[ quasi_inter ] ( b ) , we plot the result of an @xmath81 system at @xmath82 .",
    "we use the cpmc method to compute the ground state energy for each twist in this system , which is well beyond the reach of ed . in the cpmc calculation , the corresponding non - interacting ( i.e. , free electron ) wave function is used as a trial wave - function .",
    "for many high symmetry points on a uniform grid of twist angles , the ground state of non - interacting system is degenerate . in such situations ,",
    "the trial wave function ( of a single slater determinant ) is not unique , and an arbitrary choice without consideration of symmetry properties can affect the accuracy of cpmc result .",
    "( this issue is further discussed below . ) to keep the analysis simple here , we only test the pr and qr sequences . a total of @xmath94 twist angles are used for both methods .",
    "the same error analysis procedure is employed as in fig .",
    "[ quasi_inter ] ( a ) .",
    "the fitted convergence rate for pr and qr twist angles are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , again consistent with the theoretical values .",
    "these examples show that , with qr twist angles , the computed total energy from tabc converges essentially as quickly as with a uniform grid , and is much faster than with pr twists .",
    "the use of qr twists allows the advantage of the uniform grid , while overcoming two of the drawbacks of the latter in qmc calculations .",
    "the first drawback of a uniform grid is the degeneracy which often exists with a high symmetry grid point . as mentioned above",
    ", the degeneracy can affect the non - interacting wave function , and correspondingly the quality of the cpmc calculation .",
    "( multi - determinant trial wave functions can improve the quality but they require extra handling computationally . ) the second disadvantage of the uniform grid is that one needs to determine the size of the grid prior to the calculations .",
    "we often can not re - use the results from a small grid size if a larger grid turns out to be necessary for convergence .",
    "on the other hand , qr sequences are cumulative . given that in qmc one has both statistical and convergence errors present , it is desirable to be able to add additional twist angles `` on the fly '' as we accumulate better indications of the magnitude of the associated errors .",
    "the qr tabc makes this possible : one can add qr twist one by one until a desired accuracy is reached .",
    "when the sign problem is present , we use a trial wave function ( twf ) to constrain the random walk paths in afqmc . the sign or phase of the overlap of the sampled slater determinants with the twf",
    "is evaluated in each step , and this is used as a gauge condition which determines or modifies the acceptance of the move @xcite .",
    "the constraint eliminates the sign or phase instability and restores the low - power ( third power of system size here ) computational scaling , at the cost of introducing , in most cases , a systematic bias .",
    "the quality of the twf can affect the accuracy of the results . in this work",
    "we employ only single slater determinant twfs , which have been shown to provide accurate results in many systems . in hubbard - like models ,",
    "the most common choices have been the free - electron wave function or the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) solution .",
    "the two choices each have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the uhf is the best single slater determinant variationally , however , it breaks spin and translational symmetry of the system .",
    "both symmetries , on the other hand are preserved in the free - electron twf .    in this work",
    ", we use a special form of the generalized hartree - fock ( ghf ) @xcite wave function as twf in the afqmc calculations .",
    "this will increase the computation time by a factor of @xmath1 to @xmath97 in different portions of algorithm , because now the slater determinant of up and down spin are coupled .",
    "but the usage of ghf trial wave - function will reduce the bias as shown in the discussion below .",
    "this is implemented as an uhf with spin order in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane . as we illustrate next",
    ", this form combines the advantages of the uhf and free - electron twfs and performs better than both , even though it is related to the @xmath98-direction uhf by a spin rotation and is variationally the same .",
