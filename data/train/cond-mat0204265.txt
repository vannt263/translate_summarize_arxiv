    "half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf ) @xcite attract now a growing attention of researchers , first of all , because of their importance for `` spintronics '' , or spin - dependent electronics @xcite .",
    "hmf have metallic electronic structure for one spin projection ( majority- or minority - spin states ) , but for the opposite spin direction the fermi level lies in the energy gap @xcite .",
    "therefore the corresponding contributions to electronic transport properties have different orders of magnitude , which can result in a huge magnetoresistance for heterostructures containing hmf @xcite .",
    "a discovery of the half - metallic ferromagnetism in colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials like la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 @xcite has increased considerably the interest in this topic .",
    "transport properties of hmf are the subject of numerous experimental investigations ( see , e.g. , recent works for cro@xmath9 @xcite and nimnsb @xcite , and the reviews @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the theoretical interpretation of these results is still a problem .    as for electronic scattering mechanisms , the most important difference between hmf and `` standard '' itinerant electron ferromagnets like iron or nickel",
    "is the absence of one - magnon scattering processes in the former case @xcite .",
    "two - magnon scattering processes have been considered many years ago for both the broad - band case ( weak @xmath10 exchange interaction ) @xcite and narrow - band case ( `` double exchange model '' ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained temperature dependence of the resistivity have the form @xmath2 and @xmath11 , respectively . at low enough temperatures",
    "the first result fails and should be replaced by @xmath0 as well @xcite ; the reason is the compensation of the transverse and longitudinal contributions in the long - wavelength limit which is a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the @xmath10 exchange hamiltonian @xcite .    up to",
    "now there are no results which describe in the whole temperature region the resistivity of hfm and especially its magnetic - field dependence which is most interesting from the experimental point of view .",
    "such expressions are obtained in sect.2 . apart from three - dimensional case studied before @xcite we consider also two - dimensional hmf keeping in mind , e.g. , layered cmr compounds like lasr@xmath9mn@xmath9o@xmath12 ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) which are almost half - metallic according to the recent band - structure calculations @xcite .",
    "owing to peculiar band structure of hfm , an important role belongs to incoherent ( non - quasiparticle ) states which occur near the fermi level because of correlation effects @xcite . in sect.3",
    "we treat the corresponding contributions to resistivity and discuss tunneling phenomena in hmf .",
    "to investigate effects of interaction of current carriers with local moments we use the hamiltonian of the @xmath13 exchange model @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are operators for conduction electrons and localized spins in the quasimomentum representation , the electron spectrum @xmath18 is referred to the fermi level @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the @xmath13 exchange parameter which will be put for simplicity @xmath21-independent , @xmath22 are the pauli matrices . in the spin - wave region",
    "we have @xmath23 the zero - order hamiltonian includes non - interacting electrons and magnons , @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the spin splitting which is included in @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the holstein - primakoff boson operators . in the half - metallic case the spin - flip processes do not work in the second order in @xmath28 since the states with one spin projection only are present at the fermi level . at the same time , we have to consider the renormalization of the longitudinal processes in higher orders in @xmath28 ( formally , we have to include the terms up to the second order in the quasiclassical small parameter @xmath29 ) . to this end",
    "we eliminate from the hamiltonian the terms which are linear in the magnon operators by using the canonical transformation @xcite , @xmath30 with @xmath31 then we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath32 here    @xmath33    is the @xmath10 scattering amplitude which vanishes at @xmath34 and thereby takes properly into account the rotational symmetry of electron - magnon interaction .",
    "more general interpolation expression for the effective amplitude which does not assume the smallness of @xmath35 or @xmath29 was obtained in ref.@xcite by a variational approach ; it does not differ qualitatively from simple expression ( [ amp ] ) . in the case of a considerably @xmath21-dependent exchange parameter , which may be relevant for real itinerant magnets including hfm , one has in ( [ hef ] )    @xmath36    the most general and rigorous method for calculating the transport relaxation time is the use of the kubo formula for the conductivity @xmath37",

    "may be expanded in the perturbation @xmath44 @xcite . in the second order",
    "we obtain for the electrical resistivity @xmath45[{\\cal h}^{^{\\prime } } , j_x]\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is calculated with the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",

    "the band states with one spin projection only , @xmath50 are present at the fermi level @xcite . below we consider the case @xmath51 @xmath52 and omit the spin indices in the electron spectrum .",
    "we find from eq.([rho ] ) the following expression for the transport relaxation time @xmath53 defined by @xmath54@xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the bose and fermi functions .",
    "a similar expression has been derived first in ref.@xcite , but with the replacement of the effective amplitude just by @xmath28 .",
    "after some transformations we obtain @xmath58 averaging over the angles of the vector @xmath21 leads to the result @xmath59 with    @xmath60    where @xmath61 for @xmath62 and    @xmath63}^2}{({\\bf p - q)}^2q_0 ^ 2}\\,\\,\\,(p , q\\ll q_0).\\ ] ]    the wavevector @xmath64 determines the boundary of the region where @xmath65-dependence of the amplitude become important , so that @xmath66 at @xmath67",
    ". in the case @xmath68 the simple perturbation theory fails and we have to take into account the spin splitting by careful collecting the terms of higher orders in @xmath28 . in the simple one - band model of hmf",
    "where @xmath69 one has @xmath70",
    "( @xmath71 is the conduction bandwidth , lattice constant is put to unity ) @xcite . generally speaking",
    ", @xmath64 may be sufficiently small provided that the energy gap is much smaller than @xmath71 , which is the case for real hmf systems .",
    "a `` crossover '' wavector may exist in principle even for the narrow - band case ( where , instead of spin splitting , the spin subbands have different widths ) provided that the fermi level is close to the gap edge for the spin projection @xmath72 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 determines a characteristic temperature and energy scale @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the spin - wave stiffness defined by @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the curie temperature .",
    "note that in the case of an usual ferromagnetic metal the scale for existence of one - magnon processes is smaller , @xmath77 .    when estimating temperature dependences of resistivity one has to bear in mind that each power of @xmath78 or @xmath79 yields @xmath80 at very low temperatures @xmath1 small quasimomenta @xmath81 yield main contribution to the integrals . averaging the quantity ( [ lam ] ) over the angle between the vectors @xmath82 and @xmath65 we derive @xmath83 with @xmath84",
    ". then we obtain for the resistivity @xmath85 such a dependence was obtained in the narrow - band case ( double - exchange model with large @xmath35 ) , where the scale @xmath4 is absent @xcite , and by the diagram approach in the broad - band case @xcite . at the same time , at @xmath86 the function @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ lam ] ) can be replaced by unity to obtain @xmath88 this result is in agreement with the old works @xcite .",
    "now we treat the two - dimensional ( @xmath89 ) situation which may be appropriate for layered manganites like la@xmath90ca@xmath91mn@xmath9o@xmath12 @xcite . at low temperatures we obtain @xmath92 at the same time , for @xmath86",
    "we obtain after replacing the scattering amplitude by unity a logarithmically divergent integral which should be cut at @xmath4 .",
    "thus we get @xmath93    to calculate the magnetoresistivity we introduce the gap in the magnon spectrum , @xmath94 provided that the external magnetic field @xmath95 is large in comparison with the anisotropy gap , @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath95 . in the @xmath97 case the resistivity at @xmath98 is linear in magnetic field , @xmath99 the situation at @xmath86 is more interesting since the quantity @xmath100 contains a divergence which is cut at @xmath101 or @xmath4 .",
    "we have at @xmath102    @xmath103^{1/2}}\\ ] ]    ( of course , at @xmath104 the resistivity is exponentially small ) .",
    "a negative @xmath95-linear magnetoresistance was observed recently in cro@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath89 case we obtain    @xmath105    where @xmath106 this integral diverges logarithmically at @xmath107 and as @xmath108 at @xmath109 taking into account the lower limit cutoff we derive    @xmath110    we see that simple replacement of the electron - magnon scattering amplitude by @xmath28 does not enable one to describe correctly magnetoresistance even at @xmath111",
    "now we treat the impurity contributions to transport properties in the presence of potential scattering ( they were considered first in @xcite , see also @xcite ) . to second order in the impurity potential @xmath112",

    "the electron self - energy has the form @xmath116 with @xmath117 the fermi function .    neglecting vertex corrections and averaging over impurities we obtain for the transport relaxation time @xmath118 thus the contributions under consideration are determined by the energy dependence of the density of states @xmath119 for the interacting system near the fermi level .",
    "the most nontrivial dependence comes from the non - quasiparticle ( incoherent ) states with the spin projection @xmath120 which are present near @xmath19 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "they originate from the imaginary part of the electron self - energy @xcite .",
    "we obtain at @xmath121 @xmath122 the contribution ( [ inc ] ) is asymmetric and vanishes at @xmath19 ( figs.1,2 ) . near the fermi level",
    "it is determined by the magnon density of states @xmath123 and follows a power law , @xmath124 is the maximum magnon frequency , @xmath125 is the step function , @xmath126 is referred to @xmath19 ; we have @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath97 and @xmath89 cases , respectively .",
    "the corresponding correction to resistivity reads @xmath129 the contribution of the order of @xmath130 with @xmath131 ( which is not too far from 3/2 ) has been observed recently in the temperature dependence of the resistivity for nimnsb @xcite .",
    "the incoherent contribution to magnetoresistivity is given by @xmath132 so that we obtain a temperature - independent term in the @xmath89 case .",
    "the non - quasiparticle states in hmf can be probed also by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) since they lead to the unusual temperature dependence for the longitudinal nuclear magnetic relaxation rate , @xmath133 instead of the @xmath134-linear korringa contribution which is absent in hmf @xcite .",
    "another useful tool is provided by tunneling phenomena @xcite , especially by andreev reflection spectroscopy for a hmf - superconductor tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "the most direct way is probably the measurement of a tunnel current between two pieces of hmf with the opposite magnetization directions . to this end",
    "we consider a standard tunneling hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite )      where @xmath136 are the hamiltonians of the left ( right ) half - spaces , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath82 are the corresponding quasimomenta , and spin projections are defined with respect to the magnetization direction of a given half - space ( spin is supposed to be conserving in the `` global '' coordinate system ) .",
