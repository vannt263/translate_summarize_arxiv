    "since predicted by the standard model ( sm)@xcite , top quark has become an important role in high energy physics due to its large mass , which is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xcite .",
    "a great deal of researches focusing on top quark physics have been performed after its discovery in 1995 in the fermilab @xcite . on the experiment aspect , with the running of the tevatron and forthcoming lhc , the lack of adequate events will not be an obstacle for the top quark physics study . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , at the lhc @xmath2 @xmath3 pairs can be obtained per year , so this enables people to measure various top quark decay channels .",
    "meanwhile , the copious production of the top quarks supplies also a great number of bottom quark mesons since the dominant top quark decay channel is @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the bottom quark meson production in top quark decays may stand as an important and independent means for the study of heavy meson physics and the test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "as the known heaviest mesons , bottomonia and @xmath5 ( @xmath0 or @xmath6 ) possess particular meaning in the study of heavy flavor physics .",
    "the lhcb as a detector specifically for the heavy flavor study at the lhc will supply copious @xmath5 and @xmath7 data for this aim .",
    "theoretically , the direct hadroproduction of @xmath5 and @xmath7 was studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition to the `` direct '' production , `` indirect '' process as in top quark decays may stand as an independent and important source for @xmath5 and @xmath7 production .",
    "since the top quark s lifetime is too short to form a bound state @xcite , the @xmath5 and @xmath7 production involved scheme in top quark decays is less affected by the non - pertubative effects than in other processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the top quark decays into @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the born level was evaluated .",
    "recently , the s- and p - wave @xmath5 meson productions in top quark decays were fully evaluated , including the color - octet contributions , at the leading order accuracy of qcd by chang @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite .    considering the importance of investigating @xmath5 and @xmath7 in the study of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) and potential model ,",
    "it is reasonable and interesting to evaluate the production rates of these mesons in top quark decays at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy of pqcd . at the bottom quark and charm",
    "quark mass scales the strong coupling is not very small , therefore the higher order corrections are usually large . on the other hand , in the processes of top quark",
    "decays into @xmath11 , the @xmath12 , there exist large scale uncertainties in the tree level calculation @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections should in principle minimize it and give a more precise prediction . to calculate the @xmath13 and @xmath7 production rates in top quark decays at the nlo accuracy are the aims of this work . in our calculation ,",
    "both of the s - wave spin - singlet and -triplet states are taken into account , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 and @xmath16 . to deal with",
    "the non - perturbative effects , the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite effective theory is employed .",
    "the calculation will be performed at the nlo in pqcd expansion , but at leading order in relativistic expansion , that is in the expansion of @xmath17 , the relativistic velocity of heavy quarks inside bound states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , in section ii we explain the calculation of leading order decay width . in section iii ,",
    "virtual and real qcd corrections to born level result are evaluated . in section iv",
    ", the numerical calculation for concerned processes at nlo accuracy of pqcd is performed , and the scale dependence of the results is shown .",
    "the last section is remained for a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "at the leading order in @xmath18 , there are two feynman diagrams for each meson production , which are shown in figure 1 . for the convenience of analytical calculation ,",
    "taking @xmath13 as an example , the momentum of each particle is assigned as : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "for bottomonium , the only difference is that @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the momenta of anti - bottom quark and bottom quark which are produced in gluon splitting .    of the @xmath13 and @xmath28 production in top",
