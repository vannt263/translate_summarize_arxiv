    "at sufficiently high temperatures , various gross properties of qcd matter are quite different from the respective properties at zero temperature .",
    "namely , deconfinement of quarks and gluons , restoration of the isovector chiral symmetry and color screening are the key properties of the thermal qcd medium that distinguish it from the qcd vacuum at zero temperature ( see refs .",
    "for some recent reviews ) .",
    "the polyakov loop is an operator that is sensitive to changes of the color screening properties of the medium.@xcite it represents a static test charge in any particular representation of the gauge group .",
    "the bare polyakov loop in the fundamental representation is defined with the lattice regularization as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the lattice link variables and @xmath2 is understood to be averaged over the lattice volume .",
    "@xmath2 has a linear uv divergence and needs renormalization.@xcite the renormalized polyakov loop is related to the free energy of a static quark , @xmath3,@xcite through @xmath4 since the renormalization of the polyakov loop introduces a scheme dependence in terms of an additive constant in @xmath5 , only differences between @xmath5 for different temperatures are observable quantities independent of the renormalization scheme .    in pure su(n )",
    "gauge theories , the polyakov loop is an order parameter of the transition . below some transition temperature such gauge theories have a z(n ) center symmetry .",
    "since the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation is a center symmetry breaking field , its expectation value is strictly zero .",
    "the center symmetry is broken abruptly by the onset of color screening at the transition temperature .",
    "the fluctuations of the polyakov loop diverge close to the transition temperature and the polyakov loop acquires a real and positive expectation value .",
    "the discontinuous change is visible in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence , it can be used to define a deconfinement temperature that is independent of the renormalization scheme.@xcite    in qcd , this thermal transition is smoothed out by the sea quarks , and it is known that the qcd transition is a crossover.@xcite the sea quarks explicitly break the center symmetry , giving preference to a small but positive expectation value of the polyakov loop even at temperatures significantly below the crossover .",
    "this effect is understood in terms of the creation of a quark - antiquark ( @xmath8 ) pair from the vacuum and the formation of static mesons .",
    "the fluctuations and the expectation value of the polyakov loop are continuous functions and remain finite in qcd .",
    "the polyakov loop has been studied extensively with weak - coupling methods,@xcite in su(n ) gauge theories with lattice methods , @xcite and even in qcd with dynamical quarks close to or at the physical point .",
    "@xcite in the case of qcd , only the study in ref",
    ".   extends to sufficiently high temperatures for a comparison with weak - coupling approaches .",
    "studies with larger quark masses found that the restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement happen at very similar temperatures,@xcite but the situation with quark masses close to the physical point might be different .    on the one hand",
    "the inflection point of @xmath7 suggests that deconfinement happens at significantly higher temperatures than the chiral crossover for realistic light quark masses,@xcite while on the other hand a study of fluctuations of the polyakov loop with an ad - hoc renormalization prescription suggests a similar temperature for deconfinement and chiral restoration.@xcite both observations can be reconciled if the scheme dependence of the polyakov loop is actually taken into account.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : polyakov loop susceptibilities ] , we extract information on the crossover also from fluctuations of the polyakov loop treated with gradient flow as the renormalization procedure .",
    "we finally conclude and summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we calculate the polyakov loop in qcd with 2 + 1 flavors on @xmath9 lattices using the highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action and a tree - level symanzik improved gauge action.@xcite this combination has leading discretization errors at @xmath10 .",
    "we use lattices with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 and an aspect ratio of @xmath16 , which is large enough to ensure that finite volume effects are small .",
    "the strange quark mass is at the physical point and the average light quark masses are given by @xmath17 .",
    "these are slightly larger than the average physical mass and correspond to a pion mass of @xmath18 in the continuum limit .",
    "we use gauge configurations generated by the hotqcd collaboration,@xcite which were used in high temperature studies of quark number susceptibilities.@xcite we have generated new gauge configurations at higher temperatures with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and at lower temperatures for @xmath19 and @xmath15 , the former to compare with weak - coupling results and the latter to reduce of uncertainties in the crossover region.@xcite    the gauge configurations have been generated with the rational hybrid monte carlo ( rhmc ) algorithm using the milc code.@xcite the inverse gauge couplings are in the range of @xmath20 - @xmath21 .",
    "we fix the lattice spacing @xmath22 using the @xmath23 scale and its parametrization as in ref .  .",
    "since the inverse temperature is defined in the lattice regularization through @xmath24 , we observe that these gauge couplings correspond to a temperature range of @xmath25 . as we have calculated the polyakov loop after every time unit ( tu ) of molecular dynamics , the statistical samples are usually between 30000 and 60000 tus for temperatures up to @xmath26 . though the samples for higher temperatures are usually much smaller , this is more than compensated by the smaller statistical fluctuations at high temperatures .",
    "details of the gauge ensembles are found in ref .  .",
    "we show the bare free energy in units of the temperature , @xmath27 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bare fq ] .",
    "cutoff effects at fixed temperature are varied through a simultaneous change of the coupling @xmath28 ( lattice spacing @xmath22 ) and the number of time slices @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the divergence of the bare polyakov loop is evident , since the continuum limit would be approached going from the lower left towards the upper right corner in the figure .",
    "this divergence is removed in the process of renormalization .",
    "we renormalize the bare polyakov loop using three different approaches .",
    "the first approach uses the static energy in the vacuum to obtain the renormalization constant in the fundamental representation and is suited for low to intermediate temperatures .",
    "the second approach uses relations between free energies at fixed temperature but different values of the cutoff and is suited for intermediate to high temperatures .",
    "the third is a fully independent approach ",
    "the gradient flow .",
    "a renormalization constant @xmath30 is added to the free energy in each approach , @xmath31 due to the leading discretization errors of the hisq action , the renormalization constant can be parametrized as @xmath32 where the scheme - independent coefficient @xmath33 is determined by the requiring cancellation of the divergence .",
    "the scheme dependence is represented by the coefficient @xmath34 and the higher order terms .",
    "it is convenient to factor out the leading @xmath22 dependence by defining @xmath35 and renormalize @xmath36 through @xmath37 in the following we usually omit the superscript `` @xmath38 '' for renormalized quantities .",
    "the first approach relies on two relations , one between the polyakov loop and the free energy of a static @xmath8 pair at large distances , and one between the free energy and the static energy of a static @xmath8 pair at short distances .",
    "it is known from weak - coupling calculations that the static energy and the free energy of a @xmath8 pair agree at short distances up to an additive term that is a trivial color factor.@xcite furthermore , the @xmath8 free energy assumes the asymptotic value @xmath40 for sufficiently large distances , where the two charges are uncorrelated due to color screening .",
    "hence , @xmath30 is given by half the renormalization constant of the static energy .",
    "@xmath30 can be fixed in terms of the following procedure ( so - called @xmath8 procedure ) that is described in detail in ref .  .",
    "the static energy at finite cutoff is set to a prescribed value @xmath41 or @xmath42 at the distances @xmath43 or @xmath23 , where @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 or @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the larger distance @xmath47 is used for @xmath48 ( coarser lattices ) and the smaller distance @xmath49 is used for larger @xmath28 ( finer lattices ) . after fixing the renormalization constant @xmath30 with the static energy for @xmath50 ,",
    "we determine @xmath51 for intermediate values of @xmath28 through an interpolation , which is discussed in detail in ref .  .",

    ", one has to make sure that the free energy does not have any cutoff effects or one has to estimate these cutoff effects .",

    ".   turns out to be increasingly difficult for high temperatures ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the flow time interval that reproduces the temperature dependence of @xmath3 as observed in the direct renormalization scheme becomes very narrow and the flow times must be small .",
    "however , as these flow times are too small to remove the cutoff effects , we conclude that lattices with @xmath69 would be needed to use gradient flow for high temperatures.@xcite",
    "in the following we briefly discuss the extraction of the continuum limit for the free energy @xmath3 and the entropy @xmath70 and then discuss the consequences for the deconfinement aspects of the qcd crossover and for the high temperature regime .",

    "we extract the continuum limit of the free energy @xmath3 with different procedures , whose properties are outlined hereafter and covered in detail in ref .  .",

    "the @xmath29 dependence is modeled according to the leading discretization errors of the hisq action . for low temperatures",
    "@xmath76 data is not in the @xmath77 scaling regime .",
    "thus , we omit @xmath76 data and @xmath78 term in the continuum extrapolation for low temperatures .",
    "we estimate systematic uncertainties from the variation between different global and local fits , find them to be generally covered by the statistical uncertainties and eventually add these estimates in quadrature . the continuum limit from both local and global fits",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fq low ] together with older results and a calculation in the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model .",
    "the hrg is unsuitable as a description of the free energy already at @xmath79 .",
    "the new hisq result supersedes the older hisq result,@xcite and it is reasonably close to the stout result from ref .  , which has slightly different light quark masses .",
    "the free energy does not show any pronounced features that prominently indicate the onset of deconfinement .",
    "in contrast to the featureless free energy , @xmath3 , the entropy of a static quark , @xmath70 , has well - pronounced features close to the crossover .",
    "the entropy is given through a temperature derivative of @xmath3 , @xmath80 this equality is still valid if the volume is not constant , since the static quark does not exert a non - zero pressure .",
    "the entropy has already been studied in pure gauge theory with lattice methods,@xcite and with holography approaches,@xcite where @xmath70 is discontinuous at the phase transition .",
    "studies in 2- or 3-flavor qcd with quark masses much larger than the physical masses found that @xmath70 has a peak at the crossover temperature.@xcite this peak indicates the inflection point of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , a continuum calculation of @xmath70 at or close to the physical point is worthwhile as we illustrate hereafter .    using the local interpolations of @xmath36 and @xmath51 ,",
    "the entropy can be calculated at finite lattice cutoff as @xmath81 where the derivative @xmath82 is related to the non - perturbative running of the gauge coupling .",
    "this derivative can be traded for the non - perturbative beta function @xmath83 defined in ref .   through @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively the entropy may be obtained directly from the previously discussed global fits for @xmath85 , which are polynomials in the temperature . since the lattice spacing is related to the inverse temperature through @xmath86 and @xmath30",
    "is given in terms of eq .",
    ", the scheme - dependent terms vanish the continuum limit of eq . , @xmath87    hence , we find that the continuum limit of @xmath70 is a scheme - independent observable and that the peak of @xmath70 defines a scheme - independent temperature @xmath88 , which is a characteristic of the deconfinement aspect of the crossover .",
    "we obtain @xmath89 in the continuum limit ( statistical errors only ) and find that @xmath88 varies in the range @xmath90 for different fits , which defines our estimate of systematic uncertainties .",
    "we show our result for @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq cont ] together with older results at larger quark masses ,  @xcite , which are not extrapolated to the continuum limit ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the temperature axis has been rescaled by the corresponding lattice results for the pseudocritical temperature , which are cutoff dependent for the older results .",
    "the height of the peak of @xmath70 is much reduced in the continuum result .",
    "we show @xmath70 for two values of @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ntau ] . when approaching the continuum limit , we observe a fairly weak reduction of the peak height .",
    "this is definitely not enough to explain the smaller peak height of the continuum result in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq cont ] compared to the older results at finite cutoff and larger quark masses .",
    "this suggests that the lower quark mass might be the main reason for the diminished height of our peak .",
    "we see that the hrg model for the entropy clearly breaks down at temperatures well below the actual peak .",
    "in such an hrg model , the polyakov loop is given in the hadronic phase in terms of a sum over all meson and baryon states that include one static quark.@xcite on the one hand , the renormalized energy of each static hadron amount to the sum of the dynamical quark masses and the respective binding energy in the hrg .",
    "thus , the free energy of a single static quark in the hadronic phase should have a contribution linear in the dynamical quark masses . on the other hand",
    ", the free energy of a single static quark in the deconfined phase does not have the same linear quark mass dependence .",
    "thus , the hrg model suggests that the magnitude of the change of @xmath3 during the crossover , which determines the height of the peak in @xmath70 , should be roughly linear in the light quark masses . for infinite quark masses",
    "@xmath70 should diverge as seen in pure gauge theory .",
    "though the trends in the lattice results match these expectations , it is not possible to draw quantitative conclusions given the size of errors of the older results with larger quark masses .",
    "[ fig : sq ntau ] shows that the temperature @xmath88 and the chiral crossover temperature @xmath91 defined in terms of o(2 ) scaling fits at the same values of the quark masses , cf . ref .   for a detailed discussion . ] have a very similar cutoff dependence .",
    "this observation is consistent with the nave idea that chiral restoration and deconfinement happen concurrently .",

    "the observation that @xmath94 is consistently about @xmath95-@xmath96 mev higher than the chiral crossover temperature is then considered as evidence for a fairly large width of the qcd crossover .",

    "thus , we find a value of @xmath94 that is significantly higher than @xmath88 ( even at the same @xmath29 ) , which supports the findings of refs .  .",
