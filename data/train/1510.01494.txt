    "active to absorbing state phase transition ( aapt ) forms a paradigmatic example of nonequilibrium critical phenomena  @xcite . in models exhibiting aapt @xcite",
    ", a species can exist in both the active and absorbing states , such that once it is in the latter state , the transition probability to the active state vanishes .",
    "simplest models that exhibit aapt often belong to the well - known directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . some popular examples of systems showing dp universal scaling behavior @xcite are the epidemic process with recovery or the _ gribov process _ @xcite and the predator prey cellular automation models @xcite . in predator prey models for example @xcite , the growth ( birth ) and decay ( death ) of particles or species competes and",
    "thus there may be a finite density of the species in the steady state ( `` active state '' ) or extinction of the species ( `` inactive / absorbing state '' ) . under the dp hypothesis @xcite",
    ", a system with a single absorbing state undergoing aapt , shows critical behavior belonging to the dp universality class in the absence of any special symmetry , long range interactions , conservation law or quenched disorder .",
    "else , non - dp like critical behavior can not be ruled out . in some cases ,",
    "many absorbing states in an aapt have also been found ; see , e.g. , in refs .",
    "continuum descriptions of aapt in models displaying dp universality are based on the reggeon field theory @xcite , which is a stochastic multiparticle process used to describe the local growth of populations near their extinction threshold in an uniform environment @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model depends on the embedding environment which are taken as constants and their fluctuations ignored .",
    "if the fluctuations of the environment are taken into consideration , then whether the dp hypothesis and the dp universality class survive remains a question of general interest .",
    "studies dealing with the effect of environmental fluctuations on a species undergoing aapt has been made in refs .",
    "it is now believed that nontrivial environmental dynamics and its feedback on the species undergoing an aapt substantially alter the critical exponents at the aapt leading to new universal behavior different from the dp universality class .",
    "for instance , by considering the environment to follow its own fluctuating scale invariant dynamics , refs .",
    "@xcite generically found non - dp like critical scaling at the aapt , often associated with _",
    "weak dynamic scaling _",
    ", where the species undergoing aapt and the environment have unequal dynamic exponents . ref .",
    "@xcite also finds feedback of the species on the environment to be relevant in determining the ensuing universal behavior .",
    "these are in general modeled by coupling a second auxiliary dynamical field having its own dynamics with the species that undergoes an aapt .",
    "mutation of microbes and bacterial colonies has been an active area of research for quite some time now .",
    "mutation in an evolving and growing population of a species can significantly alter its long - time state .",
    "mutation in microbial colonies are important to understanding how the microbial population differentiates along the growing front in time and gives rise to well defined domains of different colonies @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the mutation rate that sets the rate of creation of the mutant of the original species is large , but the back - mutation is small , it is conceivable that the original species will eventually go extinct , leaving only the mutant population as active .",
    "on the other hand , if the mutation rate is small compared to back mutation , the original species should continue to thrive with a small population of the mutant floating around in an otherwise pure species dominated world .",
    "thus , depending upon the relative magnitudes of the mutation and the back mutation rate , the original species may become extinct by undergoing an aapt  @xcite .",
    "this has impotant consequences specially in the formation of cancer and tumour cells in tissues .",
    "if mutation gives rise to deleterious population , a proliferation of the mutants might result in cancerous growth in a healthy tissue @xcite .",
    "so to contain the deleterious mutation , one can theoretically argue that the back mutation rate into the original species should be larger than the forward mutation rate .",
    "since survival of the original species depends upon the suppressing mutation or facilitating back - mutation , it is conceivable that a back - mutation that is triggered by the presence of the original species may serve as a simple model of defence mechanism against proliferation of the mutant population , e.g. , mutant cells in a body .",
    "we incorporate this in a simple way in our model below .    in this article",
    ", we propose a two - species nonconserved reaction - diffusion model that describes the competing population dynamics of species a and and its mutant b , where the mutant b is allowed to back mutate into the pure species a. we study the aapt displayed by it .",
    "our model is distinguished by the feature that the density of the mutant species b does not obey any conservation law in the active state of the model , as a result of its interaction with the species a , unlike the models in refs .",
    "our model is well - suited to study whether or not the lack of conservation laws for the mutant b dynamics due to its coupling with the pure species a undergoing aapt affects the critical scaling of the aapt .",
    "apart from that , a more practical motivation of our model is definitely the production of mutants during the growth of a bacterial colony @xcite . despite the simplicity of our model",
    ", we obtain a set of interesting results .",
    "for example , we find one physically stable fixed point with different dynamic exponents corresponding to the two species respectively , when the diffusion coefficient of the species undergoing aapt is much greater than the diffusion coefficient of the mutant species , which in turn follows a conservation law in the absence of the pure species .",
    "this phenomena is commonly referred to as weak dynamic scaling in phase transition literature .",
    "we find that the fixed point exhibiting weak dynamic scaling shows dp like universal behaviour , with exactly the same critical exponents as the dp universality class , which we argue as purely coincidental and is a consequence of our one loop dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) analysis .",
    "strong dynamic scaling with same dynamic exponent of the two fields are expected when the diffusion coefficient of the two species are of the same order , a feature we have not discussed in this article .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section .",
    "[ mod ] we introduce our model following a brief review of the dp universality class . in section [ rg ] , we do a dynamic renormalization of our model using the drg procedure . in section [ fp ] , we find out the fixed points and the corresponding critical exponents in the weak dynamic scaling regime . in section .",
    "[ con ] we conclude our study with a summary of our results .",
    "in this section we introduce our model of population dynamics of species a and its mutant b with densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . due to the mutation of a to b and the latter s back mutation to a lead to nonconservation of b in the active state of a. before going to the details of our model , we recall the dp model in brief .      consider a population dynamics model in which the growth of the population is linearly dependent on the local species density given by @xmath1 , and the death is proportional to the square of the species density , which describes death due to overcrowding .",
    "the species density undergoes a nonequilibrium aapt , whose long wavelength , large time behaviour is described by the dp universality class .",
    "the langevin equation for such a population dynamics model can be written in terms of species density as @xcite @xmath2 where the first term on the right hand side is the diffusion term with @xmath3 as the diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is the birth rate and @xmath5 is the rate of death due to overcrowding .",
    "the stochastic function @xmath6 is a gaussian distributed white noise with zero mean and a variance @xmath7 the multiplicative nature of the effective noise ensures the existence of an absorbing state ( @xmath8 ) . on dimensional ground , a characteristic length scale @xmath9 and a diffusive time scale @xmath10 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ dpeq ] ) , with both diverging upon approaching the critical point @xmath11 .",
    "the critical exponents may be defined in the usual way @xcite @xmath12 with the mean field scaling exponents given by @xmath13 the anomalous dimension @xmath14 , which characterises the scaling of the two - point correlation function , is zero @xcite in the mean field limit . to find out how the fluctuations affect the mean field scaling exponents , a dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) calculational scheme is used to find out the corrections to the bare correlation and vertex functions in the model .",
    "it should be noted that the janssen - de dominicis action functional which corresponds to the langevin eq .",
    "( [ dpeq ] ) , has an invariance under rapidity symmetry given by @xmath15  @xcite , where @xmath16 is the auxilliary field conjugate to @xmath17  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that fluctuating environments with spatially long - ranged noises can modify the scaling behaviour of the dp universality . in this article",
    "we have introduced a reaction - diffusion model involving two species and studied how the interdependence of the two species on their mutual birth and death affects the scaling properties of the dp universality class .",
    "our two - species model consists of the species a and its mutant b. species a reproduces at a given rate ; it can also mutate to species b and also die due to overcrowding at fixed rates .",
    "naturally , proliferation of the mutant b , if unchecked , should lead to eventual extinction of a. in order to enlarge the scope of our model , we allow back - mutation from species b to a , ensuring a compettition between the original species and the mutant .",
    "we consider the specific case where back - mutation of b to a is triggered by the presence of a locally .",
    "thus , species b can back - mutate to a at a given rate , provided species a is available in its neighborhood .",
    "our choice for the specific form of back mutation , though admittedly over - simplified , serves several purposes .",
    "for instance , since the back mutation is facilitated by the presence of a , it suggests that the original species has an ability to suppress effects of ( unwanted or random ) mutations , necessary for its survival as a species .",
    "in addition , it is consistent with an absorbing state transition of a with the system being filled up with b , which we are interested to study . together with the other processes described above it provides a minimal model to study mutation and back - mutation in population dynamics of an evolving species and their effects on the aapt in the model .",

    "thus , it is stable only along the @xmath93-axis and unstable in all the other directions .",

    "this is an important observation considering the fact that it involves back mutation from species b to a. * fpv : the eigenvalues are @xmath139 .",
    "thus fpv is unstable aong the @xmath140-axis but stable in the other two directions .",
    "the wilson s flow are used to determine the critical exponents corresponding to the different fps .",
    "they are evaluated as follows : _ = , _ = , _ d_= , _ = -2.[flow ]",
    "the critical exponents are derived from the flow functions ( [ flow ] ) as _ & = & _ = - _ , [ etarho ] + 1 & = & - _ , [ nu ] + z_&= & 2+_d_. [ dynrho ] we obtain    * fpii ( dp fp ) : the exponents are @xmath141 , @xmath142 , dynamic exponent @xmath143 . *",
    "fpiv : @xmath144 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , which is exactlty equal to the dp critical exponents .",
    "thus this fp behaves like a dp fp , and displays weak dynamic scaling making it physically acceptable . note that this fp involves back mutation from mutant b to species a.",
    "thus we find that fpii and fpiv are the physically acceptable fps displaying weak dynamic scaling as is expected in the @xmath110 limit ( see below ) .",
    "also we see that @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , with @xmath147 .",
    "this shows that the weak dynamic scaling shown by the fp fpiv is stable along the @xmath111 direction also .",
    "surprisingly for fpiv , the critical exponents are all equal to the dp critical exponents .",
    "one can not say for sure if it falls under the dp universality class , as we have calculated the exponents only upto one loop order .",
    "higher loop corrections are necessary to settle the issue .",
    "the dp fp or the fpii also shows dp like critical exponents , which is not surprising given that the couplings other than @xmath93 are taken to be zero . but",
    "this fp is unstable , which is due to the birth - death couplings of @xmath21 with @xmath17 in our model , unlike its analogue in the dp model .",
    "clearly , thus on stability grounds , we accept fpiv as the fp that describes the scaling of the aapt in the present model . a schematic diagram of the fixed points in the parameter space is given in fig .",
    "[ fpdiag ] .    .",
    "the stable fp is fpiv given by the red thick dot and the unstable fps are given by thick green dots .",
    "all the fps correspond to weak dynamic scaling .",
    "note that the flow is from the unstable fps to the stable fpiv.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] ,    finally , with the knowledge of @xmath148 , we now obtain the scaling of the renormalized equal - time correlator     the fact that the critical exponents at the fpiv are identical to those at the dp fp may be heuristically argued as follows . notice that at fpiv , @xmath149 , which means either @xmath96 or @xmath95 or both of them are zero .",
    "thus either @xmath150 or @xmath151 or both are zero in this fp .",
    "if @xmath152 , the dynamics of @xmath21 is autonomous in the renormalized theory ; consequently , dp - like exponents should be expected for the scaling properties of @xmath21-dynamics near aapt . on the other hand , if @xmath153 but @xmath154 , then the renormalized dynamics of @xmath17 is effectively noise free .",
    "thus to the leading order , @xmath155 in the renormalised theory .",
    "if we substitute this in the renormlized version of ( [ rho ] ) , the effective renormalized equation for @xmath21 has the form of the basic langevin equation for dp in terms of shifted coefficients .",
    "this indicates the dp - like exponents for @xmath21 near aapt .",
    "this arugument is however only suggestive and can not be used to claim the equality of the scaling exponents at fpiv with the same for the dp problem at higher order in perturbation theory . due to the difference in the stability properties of fpii and fpiv already at the one - loop order",
    ", we tend to speculate that these two fps will correspond to different values for the scaling exponents at higher loop orders .",
    "this can only be checked by rigorous higher order calculations which are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "with the knowledge of the scaling at the aapt , we can now calculate the renormalized correlator @xmath156 of @xmath17 .",
    "notice that there are no anomalous dimension of @xmath17 and @xmath16 , nor there is any renormalization to @xmath29 .",
    "we linearize eq .",

    "this yields |(*q*,t)|^2~q^2_-2-z(-d_q^2 t ) , revealing that ( i ) @xmath160 implying weak dynamic scaling and ( ii ) @xmath17 is spatially long - ranged correlated , since @xmath161 .",
    "in this article we have proposed and studied a simple population dynamics model involving a species and its mutant : species a ( with density @xmath0 ) reproduces and dies , and also mutates to species b. we allow for a specific form of back - mutation from b to a that allows for an aapt of a that we study here . in the absorbing state , the mutant b is conserved .",
    "we perform a one - loop perturbative drg analysis to extract the critical exponents of the aapt . for reasons of analytical tractability",
    ", we analyze the model at low ( @xmath162 ) schmidt number . for @xmath162 ,",
    "we find weak dynamic scaling , i.e. , @xmath163 at two fps : fpii or the dp fp and fpiv , consistent with @xmath162 .",
    "interestingly , fpiv exhibits scaling exponents which are same as those in the dp universality class or fpii .",
    "we believe this surprising feature is fortuitous as it is not likely to be preserved when higher order contributions are taken into account . in any case , fpii is unstable where as fpiv turns out to be stable in all the directions of the parameter space . in this article",
    "we have not attempted to obtain the fps for finite @xmath98 , for which strong dynamic scaling should follow , due to the algebraic complications involved . nevertheless , from the overall stability of fpiv with @xmath99 , together with @xmath164 at this fp and the fact that no stable fp is obtained for @xmath102 , we speculate that the aapt in our model is indeed characterized by weak dynamic scaling only ( @xmath113 ) , precluding no stable fp for strong dynamic scaling . further conclusive evidence of these will however require numerically obtaining the fps from the zeros of the @xmath92-functions ( [ betau]-[betapsi ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the scaling of @xmath156 at the aapt displays long - ranged spatial correlation , which is a consequence of the long - ranged @xmath21-fluctuations at the aapt .",
    "our model has a highly simplified structure and is designed to study specific issues as discussed above . as a result , it lacks many details of a realistic population dynamics model .",
    "first of all , we have assumed an artificial form for back - mutation , which may be generalized and included in our model in a straight forward way .",
    "in addition , we have excluded the effects of environment from our study , assuming a uniform surrounding in which the interactions take place . these may be included in our model in straightforward ways ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in addition , the process of mutation is generally more complex than a simple conversion of one species to the other at a given fixed rate , as assumed here  @xcite",
    ". nonetheless , our model should be useful as a starting point to understand the critical behavior of aapt in generic population dynamics model with mutations or with multiple species .",
    "we expect , our studies should be helpful in understanding the appt in rock - paper - scissors type systems @xcite where one species feeds on a second species b , which in turn feeds on another third species that in turn feeds on the first species .",
    "we look forward to further theoretical studies along these lines .",
    "the author would like to thank a basu for stimulating discussions , helpful suggestions and careful reviewing of the manuscript .",
    "the bare vertex functions for the model can be found out by taking functional derivatives of the generating functional @xmath62 $ ] with respect to the various fields in the model i.e. , @xmath65 .",
