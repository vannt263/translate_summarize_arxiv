    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) contribute a significant fraction of the x - ray radiation of normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are binary systems containing an accreting neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) and a normal companion star . based on the masses @xmath1 of the optical companions",
    ", xrbs are conventionally divided into high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in hmxbs ,",
    "the massive ( @xmath2 ) companions generally have strong stellar winds ( with mass loss rate @xmath3yr@xmath4 ) , part of which can be captured by the compact star ; while lmxbs , in which @xmath5 , experience mass transfer through roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) of the companion , at a rate of @xmath6 yr@xmath4 . between them are intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) , in which the companion stars masses are in the range @xmath7 @xcite . mass transfer in these binaries also occurs through rlof , but on much faster , ( sub)thermal timescale of @xmath8 yr .",
    "xrbs in galactic disks are thought to have evolved from primordial binaries , in which a high - mass primary star ( @xmath9 ) formed the compact star and the secondary star as its companion .",
    "the formation and evolution of xrbs are often accompanied with mass transfer and loss of mass and orbital angular momentum ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "if the primary star evolves to be a ( super)giant and fills its roche lobe ( rl ) , its mass is transferred to the secondary via rlof .",
    "if the mass ratio of the primary and secondary stars is sufficiently high or the primary star has a deep convective envelope , the mass transfer process occurs on a dynamical timescale and is highly unstable , so that a common - envelope ( ce ) enshrouding binary results .",
    "the secondary star is captured by the expansion of the giant star and is forced to move through the giant s envelope .",
    "the resulting frictional drag will cause its orbit to shrink rapidly while , at the same time , ejecting the envelope before the naked core of the giant star explodes to form the ns / bh .",
    "the binary , if it survives the supernova ( sn ) , will evolve to be an xrb when the secondary begins to transfer mass to the compact star .",
    "note that during the formation and evolution processes of xrbs there may be several instances of mass transfer and ce phases .",
    "for example , hmxbs may end up in a ce phase , as the ns ( or bh ) is engulfed by the extended envelope of its companion . if the system survives after the ce , an xrb with a helium companion may be produced .",
    "the formation of lmxbs in globular clusters often invokes dynamical process such as tidal capture of a low - mass main sequence ( ms ) star by a ns @xcite and exchange encounters between an ns and a primordial binary @xcite .",
    "young star clusters and x - ray sources from them have many interesting aspects on modern astrophysics .",
    "recent data shows that compact young massive clusters contain a rich population of massive stars , evidently following a standard salpeter - like upper initial mass function ( imf ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are also indications that some compact young massive clusters have either a flatter than normal upper mass function or a cut - off at low mass @xcite .",
    "additionally , observational studies on the mass ratio of binaries have reached widely varying , even disparate conclusions ( reviewed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies find that there are two populations of secondaries in clusters , which leads to a bimodal distribution of mass ratios ( for more , see  1.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , @xcite , using data from the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits @xcite , reassessed the @xcite study and concluded that the data support an excess of @xmath10 twin systems .",
    "these cases all reveal that potentially more massive binaries will be produced in these young clusters , which may present different observational properties when they turn on x - rays .",
    "so investigations on xrbs in young star clusters may help explore , besides the formation and evolution of xrbs , the fundamental properties of the clusters as well as recent star formation processes in galaxies , including stellar population in galaxies @xcite , massive star formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "using observations from _ chandra _ and nicmos on board _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , @xcite examined the spatial offsets between x - ray point sources and star clusters in three star - burst galaxies .",
    "they found that ( 1 ) the x - ray sources are preferentially located near the star clusters , indicating that the x - ray sources are young objects associated with current star formation , and ( 2 ) brighter x - ray sources preferentially occur closer to clusters .",
    "the displacements of the x - ray sources observed in these starburst galaxies are likely due to the motion of the x - ray sources caused by the sn explosions and/or dynamical interactions with other stars and binaries in the clusters .",
    "the absence of bright x - ray sources with large displacements suggests that there is some correlation between the luminosity of an x - ray source and its motion when the x - ray luminosity @xmath11 ergs@xmath4 .",
    "they proposed that these high luminosity sources may be rlof bh - xrbs with intermediate mass companions , if emitting isotropically and running away at a speed of @xmath12 10 kms@xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath12 50 kms@xmath4 instead , the short lifetime ( @xmath13 4 myr ) of these luminous sources needs very massive companion stars or alternatively the luminosity of the sources decreases with age , which can be examined by an evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) calculation .",
    "they also pointed out that the correlation appears inconsistent with the highly beamed x - ray emission model @xcite because the delay time between the formation of a bh and the onset of the thermal time - scale mass transfer is long enough for the x - ray source to move to @xmath14 kpc from its point of origin .",
    "the spatial offset between the x - ray point sources and the star clusters , especially the x - ray luminosity versus displacement correlation is determined by the velocity of the binary after the birth of the ns / bh , the time passed since the sn , and the mass transfer process .",
    "spatial distribution of x - ray sources in galactic environment has been investigated both observationally and theoretically .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have investigated the spatial distribution of ns and bh lmxbs in our galaxy , from which they suggested that the compact objects had received a kick during the sn explosion .",
    "@xcite also studied the spatial distribution of galactic nss in the scope of sn kicks .",
    "recently @xcite modeled the spatial distribution of galactic xrbs , incorporating the kinematic evolution of kicked binary systems .",
    "@xcite calculated the scale - heights as well as the radial and space velocity distributions of pulsars , considering their kinematic evolution within the galactic potential",
    ". however , for xrbs born in star clusters , besides mass ejection from the binary @xcite and the kick velocity imparted on the newborn ns caused by the sn explosion @xcite , an ejection speed via dynamical interactions in clusters @xcite should also be considered . in our calculation",
    "we only consider the former two mechanisms on the motion of xrbs ( i.e. , primordial binaries ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) though the third one can also influence the binary population , but not significantly in our situation , as explained below .",
    "dynamical interactions include tidal capture , physical collisions and exchange encounters .",
    "the formation rate of ns - xrbs produced through tidal capture process using eq .",
    "( 3 ) from @xcite can be estimated as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the number densities of nss and other stars , respectively , @xmath18 is the relative velocity between the stars at infinity , @xmath19 $ ] ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( 2 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the cross section of the two passengers with small relative velocities , @xmath20 the ns mass , @xmath21 the mass of the companion star , and @xmath22 is the distance of closest approach of the two passengers .",
    "here we adopt @xmath23 and @xmath24 10@xmath25 which is estimated roughly from eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite . given the typical values of young massive clusters as @xmath26 kms@xmath4 , the core radius @xmath27 pc , the central density @xmath28 pc@xmath29 @xcite , we can get @xmath30 pc@xmath29 , @xmath31 pc@xmath29 assuming an imf of @xcite , following the approach ( i.e. ,  3.1 ) of @xcite , here @xmath32 is the fraction of nss remaining in the cluster .",
    "then we can estimate the predicted number of xrbs in one cluster is @xmath33 with an x - ray lifetime @xmath34 myr .",
    "so the expected number of xrbs produced through this channel in the @xcite sample is very small ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "exchange encounters can also occur on time - scale of a few myr @xcite , although the formation rate of xrbs through exchange collisions barely competes with two - body encounters @xcite .",
    "however , during the exchange encounters a lower mass binary star tend to be replaced by a more massive participant .",
    "hence the effect of exchange encounters is to modify the mass - ratio distribution of the binaries , making equal - mass binaries more likely .",
    "we examined this effect in our models ( i.e. , models m3 and m7 ) and found no significant changes .    in the present work",
    ", we investigated the kinematic consequences of xrbs from star clusters in star - burst galaxies from a theoretical point of view .",
    "we used an eps code to calculate the expected cumulative distribution of xrb displacements from their parent clusters . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", we calculated the spatial offset distribution of xrbs with luminosities @xmath36 ergs@xmath4 .",
    "we mainly examined several parameters , such as imf , the secondary star mass function , common envelop efficiency and kick velocity , which may affect the formation , evolution and motion of massive xrbs significantly .",
    "the objective of this study is to use the apparent x - ray luminosity versus displacement correlation to constrain the model parameters and the fundamental properties of clusters in star - burst galaxies .",
    "we also aim to explore why such correlation exists , which may help understand the nature of the sources and may be testified by future observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe the population synthesis method and the input physics for xrbs in our model .",
    "the calculated results are presented in  3 .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are in  4 .",
    "to follow the evolution of xrbs , we have used the eps code developed by @xcite in our calculations .",
    "this code incorporates evolution of single stars with binary - star interactions , such as mass transfer , mass accretion , ce evolution , sn kicks , tidal friction and angular momentum loss mechanics ( i.e. , mass loss , magnetic braking and gravitational radiation ) .",
    "we also updated the original code according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the values of other adopted parameters are the same as the default parameters in hurley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) if not mentioned .    in the @xcite samples , the ages of the star clusters range from 1 to 20 myr",
    ", we then adopt a constant star formation rate for 20 myr .",
    "for each model , we evolve @xmath37 primordial systems , all of which are initially binary systems .",
    "we set up the same grid of initial parameters ( primary mass , secondary mass and orbital separation ) as @xcite did and evolve each binary on the grid . in the following we describe the assumptions and input parameters in our control model ( i.e. , model m1 , listed in table 1 ) .    _",
    "( 1 ) initial parameters _",
    "+ we adopt the imf of @xcite for the distribution of the primary mass ( @xmath20 ) . for the secondary s mass ( @xmath21 ) , we assume a uniform distribution of the mass ratio @xmath38 between 0 and 1 .",
    "a uniform distribution is also taken for the logarithm of the orbital separation @xmath39 .    _ ( 2 ) ce evolution _",
    "+ when mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable , a ce will engulf the binary .",
    "an important parameter in the evolution of close binaries is the ce parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it describes the efficiency of ejecting the envelope ( @xmath40 ) by converting orbital energy ( * @xmath41 * ) into the kinetic energy that provides the outward motion of the envelope ( @xmath42 ) , described as @xmath43 .",
    "there are several schemes for the ce evolution in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we adopt the estimation of the reduction of the orbital separation suggested by @xcite @xmath44,\\ ] ] which yields the ratio of final ( post - ce ) to initial ( pre - ce ) orbital separations as @xmath45 in the above equations the subscripts @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the final and initial values , respectively ; @xmath48 is the core mass of the primary star ( @xmath20 ) that fills out its rl , @xmath49 is the dimensionless rl radius , and @xmath50 is a parameter which depends on the stellar mass - density distribution , respectively . here",
    "we adopt @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the orbital separation of the surviving binaries is often reduced by a factor of @xmath53 as a result of the spiral - in . if there is not enough orbital energy available to eject the envelope , the orbital motion of the companion during the spiral - in process may be unable to drive off the envelope of the primary star , resulting in coalescence rather a compact binary .    _ ( 3 ) sn kick velocity _ + when a binary survives a sn explosion , it receives a velocity kick due to any asymmetry in the explosion @xcite .",
    "the kick velocity @xmath54 is assumed to be imparted on the newborn ns with the maxwellian distribution @xmath55 and we adopt @xmath56=190 kms@xmath4 @xcite in our control model . for bh systems , we assume that those bhs formed with successful sn explosions ( the carbon / oxygen core mass less than @xmath57 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were imparted on a natal kick velocity , which is inversely proportional to the bh mass , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise no kick velocity is adopted .",
    "the velocity ( @xmath59 ) of the binary system is related to both the kick velocity and the orbital velocity of the system , and can be expressed as ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the total masses of the system before and after the sn , respectively ; @xmath63 is the current mass of the primary star after losing mass @xmath64 during the sn , @xmath65 is the relative orbital velocity of the stars ( expressed as eq .",
    "a1 in @xcite ) .",
    "tidal effect is taken into account to remove any eccentricity induced in a post - sn binary prior to the onset of mass transfer .",
    "we also construct several other models by changing the key input parameters ( listed in table 1 ) .",
    "recent observations indicate that some compact young massive clusters contain relatively more massive stars @xcite , we then consider an imf from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , model m2 and m6 ) , which is more skewed towards high mass than in the solar neighbourhood for comparison .",
    "the secondary star mass function can also strongly affect the formation rate of different type of sources @xcite .",
    "for example , different choice of the secondary star mass function can change the formation rates of ns binaries by nearly a factor of @xmath53 @xcite . here",
    "we assume the secondary mass following a power - law distribution : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "most population synthesis studies adopt a flat mass spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath68 in our control model m1 ) for systems that are likely to interact , while recent observations seem to be more consistent with ",
    "twins \" being a general feature of the close - binary population ( i.e. , model m3 and m7 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . as stated before , binary interactions may also tend to modify the mass ratio to approach unity .",
    "so we also adopt @xmath69 to examine its effect .",
    "variations in the ce parameter can considerably change the relative numbers of xrbs . however , reliable value for @xmath70 has proven difficult to estimate , due to lack of understanding the complicated processes involved . generally @xmath71 1 is used but its range can change widely from @xmath13 0.1 to @xmath13 3.0 ( see discussion in  4 ) .",
    "so we also adopt @xmath72 for comparison ( i.e. , models m5 , m6 , m7 and m8 ) .    finally ,",
    "since the kick velocity @xmath54 can affect not only the global velocity of the binary system but the outcome of the xrb evolution , we also adopt @xmath73 kms@xmath4 ( i.e. , models m4 and m8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for comparison .",
    "since star clusters in star - burst regions are usually centrally concentrated , we assume a spherical potential and adopt the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) centered at the cluster s center . the potential of a cluster can be constructed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the gravitational constant , @xmath79 the half light radius and @xmath80 the total mass of stars within the half light radius . here",
    "we adopt @xmath81 , and @xmath82 pc @xcite in our calculations , and found very small difference in the final results . ] .",
    "we assume that stars are born uniformly in the star cluster with random direction of the initial velocity vector , which gives the initial velocity vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "due to the cylindrical symmetry of the potential , two space coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath76 are sufficient to describe the xrb distributions .",
    "then we integrate the motion equations ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "( 19a , b ) in * ? ? ? * ) with a fourth - order runge - kutta method to calculate the trajectories of the binary systems and collect the parameters of current xrbs if turning on x - rays .",
    "finally we project the positions of xrbs on the @xmath86 plane to get the projected distances of xrbs from star clusters , i.e. , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath89 . in our calculations , the accuracy of integral is set to be @xmath90 and controlled by the energy integral .",
    "compact stars in xrbs are powered by either disk or wind accretion . when a star expands to fill its rl as a result of stellar evolution , or by angular momentum losses causing contraction of the orbit",
    ", it can transfer masses via an accretion disk which is fed by rlof ; otherwise , mass - transfer can not occur except that there is a stellar wind to power an observable x - ray source ( i.e. , wind - accretion ) .",
    "we adopt the same procedures to calculate x - ray luminosity and divide different types of sources as in @xcite if not mentioned .",
    "in particular , for disk - fed sources , the simulated x - ray luminosity form is as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the bolometric correction factor which is introduced to convert the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath93 ) to the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath94 kev energy range @xcite ; @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the efficiency for energy conversion , @xmath97 is the average mass accretion rate for accreting systems and @xmath98 is the velocity of light ; @xmath99 is the  begelman factor \" @xcite to allow super - eddington luminosities ; the critical eddington luminosity @xmath100ergs@xmath4 ( where @xmath101 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath102 the proton mass ) . for transient sources , the luminosities in outbursts",
    "are taken to be a fraction ( @xmath103 ) of the eddington luminosity .",
    "here we adopt @xmath104 and 1 for ns systems if the orbital period @xmath105 is less and longer than 1 day , respectively ; for bh systems , we adopt @xmath106 hr and let the maximum peak luminosity not exceed @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "to discriminate transient and persistent sources , we use the criteria of @xcite for ms and red - giant donors , and of @xcite for white dwarf donors , respectively .",
    "the three star - burst galaxies m82 , ngc 1569 and ngc 5253 in @xcite all contain several young , luminous star clusters and luminous x - ray sources in them .",
    "the number of x - ray sources in m82/ngc 1569/ngc 5253 is 42/14/10 with the corresponding cluster number 50/58/13 , respectively .",
    "the spatial offset between the x - ray point sources and the star clusters shows that , while the x - ray sources are generally located near the star clusters , brighter x - ray sources preferentially occur closer to the clusters , and there is an absence of very bright sources ( @xmath11 ergs@xmath4 ) at relatively large displacements ( @xmath108 pc ) from the clusters .",
    "here we modeled the kinematic evolution of xrbs from the star clusters .",
    "the calculated results are presented below .    as stated before we constructed 8 models to investigate how the final results are influenced by the adopted parameters .",
    "specifically the input parameters in our control model ( i.e. , model m1 ) are sfh@xmath109 myr , @xmath110 kms@xmath4 , @xmath68 , @xmath111 , and the kroupa imf . in other models",
    "we change only one parameter each time , and the model parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show the simulated cumulative distribution of the x - ray source displacements ( top : total ; middle : ns - xrbs ; bottom : bh - xrbs ) at the age of 20 myr for models m1-m4 and m5-m8 , respectively . note that we only select sources in the luminosity range @xmath112 ergs@xmath4 in order to compare with @xcite .",

    "the color bar represents the normalized number ratio of xrbs in the @xmath115 plane .",

    "it is interesting to note that there is a flat - roofed edge in the @xmath122 pc region , which is not caused by the eddington luminosity limit for bh - xrbs .    in order to explore the nature of the xrbs in different regions , we need to examine their observational properties ( i.e. , current mass @xmath21 and spectral type of the donor star , orbital period @xmath105 , and system velocity distribution ) .",

    "table  3 indicates that the majority ( @xmath134 80@xmath135 ) of these sources are ns - xrbs .",
    "they mainly have hems companions ( @xmath13 50@xmath135 in model m4 to @xmath13 85@xmath135 in model m7 ) , with mass transfer either through rlof or by wind capture .",

    "their orbital periods are around several hours for all models .",
    "the typical velocities are @xmath136 kms@xmath4 , much larger than those of high - luminosity sources .",
    "we tentatively conclude that the difference in the luminosities for the sources in regions a , b and c is caused by different types of the compact objects ( bh - xrbs vs. ns - xrbs ) , of the donors ( hems star vs. ms star ) , and of the accretion modes ( rlof vs. wind - capture ) .",
    "sources in region a are mainly bh - xrbs with rlof mass transfer from an hems companion , hence reaching very high luminosities .",
    "sources in region b have similar properties as those in region a , but are mainly ns - xrbs , with relatively lower luminosities .",
    "sources in region c are either ns - xrbs ( in models m1-m4 ) , or contain a portion of bh - xrbs with ms companions , so they also can not reach luminosities as high as those in region a.    the displacement of the xrbs from the star clusters depends on their velocities at the moment of the sn explosion and the delay time from the sn to the beginning of rlof . in fig .",
    "9 we present the distribution of the delay times for sources in regions a ( dash - dot - dotted line ) , b ( solid line ) and c ( dotted line ) , respectively .",
    "we normalize each the histograms by the total number of x - ray sources in each region .",
    "they generally range from 1 to 8 myr , but the times are a bit shorter in models m1-m4 than in m5-m8 . in the latter they peak at @xmath137 myr .",
    "note that the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation has different origin between models m1-m4 ( @xmath111 ) and models m5-m8 ( @xmath72 ) . in the @xmath111 cases ,",
    "it is constructed by both high - luminosity ( @xmath116 ergs@xmath4 ) bh - xrbs and low - luminosity ( @xmath138 ergs@xmath4 ) ns - xrbs , while in the @xmath72 cases , it results from bh - xrbs instead , so we need to discuss them separately . in models",

    "m5-m8 , a number of rlof bh - xrbs with ms companions are produced , significantly different from models m1-m4 .",
    "these xrbs , occupying region c , have relatively lower luminosities and higher velocities compared to the bh - xrbs with hems donors in region a.    in order to understand the difference in the binary velocities in different models , we examine the distribution of the companion masses @xmath141 , and orbital periods @xmath142 at the moment of sn explosions .",
    "it is clearly seen from eq .",
    "( 5 ) that the velocity of an xrb is determined by the kick velocity , total mass and ejected mass , orbital velocity ( or orbital period ) when sn occurs . figures  10 and 11 show the @xmath143 distribution in regions a , b and c for models m1-m4 and m5-m8 , respectively .",
    "high - luminosity sources in region a ( top panel ) generally have longer - period ( hence smaller orbital velocity ) and more massive companions , resulting in smaller system velocity ( hence smaller offset from the parent cluster ) than low - luminosity sources ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this fact implies that the orbital evolution plays an important role in kinematic motion and the spatial distribution of xrbs .",
    "the formation of xrbs usually invokes at least one ce phase .",
    "so the ce parameter @xmath0 can influence the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation by affecting the binary orbit distribution after the ce evolution .",
    "this further determines the evolutionary state of the donor star during the xrb phase and the system velocity after the sn explosion .",
    "it has two contrary effects on the formation and evolution of xrbs .",
    "larger values of @xmath70 can prevent coalescence of a bh / ns and the companion in a compact binary during the unstable mass transfer processes , in favor of the formation of compact xrbs ; while for some initially wide binary systems , a higher value of @xmath0 can cause the rlof mass transfer to a ns / bh not to occur within 20 myr , decreasing the formation rate of xrbs .",
    "so variation of @xmath0 may lead to different types of xrb populations .",
    "in addition , it can affect the orbital velocity , and the velocity of the binary .",
    "larger @xmath0 means that more energy was used to drive off the envelop , leading to wider orbital separation , and hence smaller orbital velocity after the sn explosion .    to explore the influence of @xmath0 in detail , we present an example evolutionary sequence for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 of an xrb source in region c in figure  12 .",
    "we consider a primordial binary system in a @xmath146 orbit . the initial stellar masses are 14.309 and 3.833 @xmath126 for the primary and secondary , respectively . in model m5 ,",
    "the primary first evolves across the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) , expands and fills its rl at the time 13.7057 myr , then transfers mass to the secondary star , which is still on ms . due to the large mass ratio ,",
    "the secondary is unable to accept the overflowing material , and the system enters the ce stage .",
    "the secondary spirals within the envelope and drives it off on a dynamical timescale , leaving a compact binary ( @xmath147 ) with the he core ( of mass of @xmath148 ) of the primary . at the time of @xmath149 myr , the he star evolves across the hg and fills its rl .",
    "the system enters the second ce stage , which makes the orbital separation to shrink again . in a very short time",
    ", the sn explosion occurs and a ns ( of mass @xmath150 ) is born .",
    "the post - sn binary gets a global velocity of @xmath151 kms@xmath4 due to the large orbital velocity before the sn .",
    "now the binary separation becomes @xmath152 .",
    "because of the small separation , the secondary star will fill its rl immediately and transfer mass to the ns , leading to the formation of an ns - xrb . at the time of 16.0062 myr",
    ", the ns collapses into a bh with mass of @xmath153 , and a bh - xrb with an ms companion is formed after twice ce evolutions .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath113 first rises to @xmath154 ergs@xmath4 and then decreases gradually with time . at the time of 17.69 myr",
    ", @xmath113 decreases to be @xmath155 ergs@xmath4 and the orbital period evolves to be @xmath156 hr . by now",
    "the binary has moved for about 2 myr since the sn explosion , with a displacement of about 400 pc .",
    "the above story explains how bh - xrbs of this type ( rlof and ms companion ) can move to region c. however , when we decrease the @xmath0 to be 1.0 , there is nt sufficient energy to drive off the entire envelope of the primary star during the first ce phase , leading to coalescence of the giant core and the ms star .",
    "so no such type of xrbs will be produced .",
    "note that in the above case , most of the low - luminosity ( @xmath138 ergs@xmath4 ) bh - xrbs in region c are formed from accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of ns systems . whether aic of nss really happens is still under debate , since quite a few binary millisecond pulsars , though thought to have experienced extensive mass accretion , seem to have masses not far from @xmath157 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , suggesting significant mass loss during accretion .",
    "so we examine this effect in figs .  13 and 14 , which are the same as figs .  3 and 4 , except that we do not consider the ns@xmath158bh aic formation channel .",
    "it is clearly seen that , in the case of @xmath72 ( i.e. , models m5-m8 ) , the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 correlation barely exists , but is constructed by ns - xrbs instead , and bh - xrbs disappear in region c. we propose that precise velocity measurement of bh - xrbs may serve as a possible way to discriminate different bh formation channels .    to explore the evolution of the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation , we plot @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 in fig .",
    "15 at the time 20 , 30 , and 40 myr for models m1 ( top ) and m5 ( bottom ) .",
    "note that the correlation in both cases exists at 20 myr after the star formation , and disappears gradually as time goes on .",
    "if we shorten the sfh to 5 myr , the correlation disappears much earlier , at the time of @xmath13 25 myr .",
    "so the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 correlation can not hold all the time for individual cluster .",
    "we have used an eps code to calculate the spatial offset distribution of xrbs from their parent star cluster in star - burst galaxies .",
    "we used the apparent x - ray luminosity versus displacement correlation to constrain models of xrbs .",
    "our study shows that the correlation can be roughly reproduced with all models considered , but significant differences exist when changing the common envelope parameter @xmath0 . in the @xmath111 cases ( models m1-m4 ) ,",
    "the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation is constructed by both high - luminosity ( @xmath116 ergs@xmath4 ) , small - offset ( @xmath159 pc ) bh - xrbs and low - luminosity ( @xmath138 ergs@xmath4 ) , large - offset ( @xmath121 pc ) ns - xrbs , while for @xmath72 ( models m5-m8 ) , it is mainly determined by bh - xrbs . in this case , a bunch of high - speed ( @xmath13 150 kms@xmath4 ) , low - luminosity , rlof xrbs with ms donors dominate the sources in the @xmath121 pc region , which are not seen when @xmath111 .",
    "the detailed source types in region a , b and c are listed in tables  2 - 4 , and summarized below .",
    "\\(1 ) the high - luminosity ( @xmath116 ergs@xmath4 ) sources in the @xmath119 pc region in all models are mainly rlof bh - xrbs with hems companions .",
    "they all have short orbital period ( @xmath13 1 hr ) and low - mass ( @xmath13 1 - 3 @xmath126 ) companions .",
    "the system velocity is @xmath13 10 - 20 kms@xmath4 for models m1-m4 , and slightly higher , @xmath13 30 - 100 kms@xmath4 for models m5-m8 .",
    "\\(2 ) the low - luminosity ( @xmath138 ergs@xmath4 ) sources in the @xmath119 pc regions in all models are mainly ( @xmath134 80@xmath135 ) ns - xrbs with hems companions ( from @xmath13 50@xmath135 in model m4 to @xmath13 85@xmath135 in model m7 ) , transferring mass through rlof or wind - capture .",
    "the orbital periods are @xmath129 hr for models m1 and m3-m8 , and can reach @xmath130 hr for model m2 .",
    "the companion masses are @xmath160 for models m1 and m4 , @xmath161 for models m5-m8 and can reach @xmath162 for models m2 and m3 .",
    "\\(3 ) the xrbs in the @xmath121 pc regions in all models all have relatively low - mass ( @xmath13 1 - 4 @xmath126 ) companions .",
    "their orbital periods are about several hours , and their system velocities are @xmath13 150 - 300 kms@xmath4 . for models m1-m4 , only ns - xrbs can be found in this region , with both ms and hems donors . for models",
    "m5-m8 , there are nearly comparable number of bh - xrbs and ns - xrbs , with mainly ms donors .",
    "the bh - xrbs in these models are from aic of ns systems .",
    "our results indicate that the imfs of the primary and the secondary stars , and the kick velocity can affect the formation and evolution of massive xrbs , but not so significant to constrain models by comparing with the observed @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation .",
    "however , changing the ce parameter @xmath0 can make significant differences in stellar components that construct the correlation .",
    "we suggest the remarkable different types of xrb in the @xmath121 pc region may provide an interesting clue to constrain the ce parameter .",
    "common envelope evolution has long been the subjects of studies , from early semi - empirical estimates by @xcite and @xcite , followed by series of works by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , to recent 3-d hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite .",
    "however , reliable value of @xmath0 is still uncertain due to lack of understanding of the processes involved .",
    "previous semi - empirical estimates suggested that @xmath0 is in the range 0.6 - 1.0 @xcite and 0.3 - 0.6 @xcite , but the value was later suggested to be greater than unity if additional energy source is considered , such as thermal and ionization energy of the envelope @xcite or possibly nuclear energy generated in the region close to the in - spiraling companion @xcite and others ( see * ? ? ? * for more ) . in some evolutionary calculations ,",
    "high value of @xmath0 ( @xmath13 3 ) was required in order to model the formation of low - mass bh binaries @xcite , low- and intermediate - mass bh - xrbs @xcite and low - mass , short - period bh binaries @xcite .",
    "note in our calculations , much more bh - xrbs can be produced in the @xmath72 cases than in the @xmath111 cases , which is consistent with their findings .",
    "our results are subject to some uncertainties and simplified treatments .",
    "for example , in our calculations , we only consider the primordial binaries .",
    "however , dynamical interactions in star clusters can produce new xrbs and modify the imfs of the primordial binary stars , though the proportion may be small , as estimated above .",
    "another simplified treatment is taken for the ce evolution . besides @xmath0 , the @xmath50-parameter , which describes the binding energy between the envelope and the core of the donor star , can also affect the ce evolution .",
    "it depends on the structure of the stellar envelope , and consequently on the evolutionary stage of the star . in our calculation",
    ", we adopt a constant ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) disregarding the evolution of the donor star at the onset of the mass transfer process , though the value of @xmath50 changes remarkably . for example , typical value of @xmath50 was found to be between 0.2 and 0.8 , but can be greater than 5 for the asymptotic giant branch of lower - mass stars @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite showed that for more massive stars ( i.e. , @xmath163 ) , the value of @xmath50 may be low as 0.1 .",
    "so incorporating @xmath50 as a function of stellar radius will help model the @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 relation more precisely , and put more realistic constraints on the model parameters , though it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for his helpful comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper .",
