    "if a new particle is produced in the @xmath1-channel at hadron colliders , then it can decay into a pair of hadronic jets (  dijet \" ) .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the dijet exhibits a peak at ( or slightly below ) the mass of the new particle @xcite . in many models , particles produced in the @xmath1-channel",
    "can decay into leptons or other final states with low backgrounds .",
    "if the branching fractions of those final states are small enough , however , the dijet resonance searches may provide the simplest way of discovering the new particles .",
    "searches for narrow dijet resonances at hadron colliders have been performed over the last three decades by the ua2 @xcite and ua1 @xcite experiments at the sps collider , the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments at the tevatron , and the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc .",
    "the results are traditionally presented as limits on an effective rate ( defined as cross section times branching fraction times acceptance ) to produce a resonance as a function of its mass .",
    "while this procedure has the advantage of being rather model - independent , it complicates the comparison of experimental results with theoretical models .",
    "the acceptance , in particular , requires the computation of the probability for the two jets to be observed in a certain geometric region of the detector .",
    "this can be done analytically given the differential cross section of the signal and the kinematic cuts , as long as effects arising from showering , from an assumed gaussian signal ( in the case of atlas  @xcite ) , or from a mismatch between partons and analysis - level wide jets are negligible . otherwise , it is necessary to perform a simulation based on the jet selection criteria used by the experimental analyses .",
    "the effective rate procedure also precludes a comparison of the limits set in @xmath2 collisions ( at the sps and the tevatron ) with those from @xmath3 collisions ( at the lhc ) . even for a particular collider",
    ", it is hard to compare the limits set during runs of different energies , because the cross section grows with the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath4 ) for a fixed resonance mass .",
    "a naive hope is that limits set at the larger @xmath5 and with larger integrated luminosity would supersede previous limits .",
    "the situation is not so straightforward because the backgrounds also increase so that the trigger thresholds for a jet - only final state need to be increased . as a result",
    ", the sensitivity to lighter resonances can be better in the runs using lower luminosity or lower energy .",
    "for example , the atlas dijet limits from @xmath6 tev start at a resonance mass that has increased with luminosity from 0.3 tev  @xcite to 0.6 tev  @xcite to 0.9 tev  @xcite to 1 tev  @xcite , and those from @xmath7 tev start at a mass 1.5 tev  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we explore a unified presentation of the dijet limits in a coupling - versus - mass plot .",
    "the mass and coupling refer to a certain hypothetical particle , of a given spin and @xmath8 charges , which is produced in the @xmath1-channel at hadron colliders and decays into a pair of jets .",
    "this is by no means a substitute for the effective rate plots , as it is more model - dependent .",
    "the coupling - versus - mass plot , however , has the advantage of allowing simple comparisons of searches performed at different luminosities , experiments , @xmath5 or colliders .",
    "furthermore , it provides a measure of how stringent the limits are given some natural ranges for the physical parameters .",
    "specifically , we consider an electrically - neutral spin-1 particle that couples in a flavor - universal way to the sm quark - antiquark pairs and is leptophobic , _",
    "i.e. _ , its tree - level couplings to sm leptons vanish .",
    "this is well motivated by the following arguments . in many theories beyond the sm",
    ", there are particles that can be produced from a quark - antiquark initial state and lead to a dijet resonance with large rates . by contrast , both the gluon - gluon ( as in the case of the higgs boson ) and quark - gluon initial states require a loop to produce an @xmath1-channel resonance , so that the signal is typically too small ( at least in perturbative theories ) to compete with the dijet background",
    ". the quark - quark initial state could lead to an @xmath1-channel resonance if there is a di - quark scalar , but in that case flavor - changing processes typically impose strong constraints on its mass and couplings ( these are relaxed in the case of the color - sextet , hypercharge-4/3 di - quark @xcite ) .    electroweak symmetry suppresses the coupling of spin-0 particles to first generation @xmath9 pairs ( an exception is the color - octet weak - doublet scalar @xcite , but in that case there are strong flavor constraints ) .",
    "leptophobic spin-2 particles , although possible , require much more complicated uv completions .    including a spin-1 particle coupled to first generation quarks is more straightforward .",
    "large flavor effects are avoided if its quark couplings are generation - independent .",
    "moreover , the spin-1 particle should be associated with a spontaneously - broken gauge symmetry ( unless the particle is a bound state whose compositeness scale is near its mass ) , and the cancellation of various gauge anomalies is more easily achieved for equal couplings to up- and down - type quarks . although some of the above arguments can be evaded ( for example , with a more complicated fermion sector that is anomaly - free ) , a flavor - universal gauge boson appears to be the simplest origin of a dijet peak . in order to couple to the sm quarks , the heavy gauge boson must be either a singlet or an octet under the @xmath10 color group .    in the case of the color singlet ( a @xmath0 boson ) , the dijet channel can be the discovery mode only if the @xmath0 is nearly leptophobic ( for an early model , see @xcite ) and its decays into higgs states  @xcite or vectorlike leptons  @xcite are suppressed .",
    "we consider @xmath0 bosons whose tree - level leptonic and higgs couplings vanish , implying that the gauge charges are proportional to the baryon number .",
    "the corresponding @xmath11 symmetry is anomalous in the sm , but we will show that it is anomaly - free in the presence of a few vector - like quarks ( the simplest charge assignment has been discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "a color - octet gauge boson , referred to as the coloron  @xcite , is associated with a @xmath12 extension of qcd , and is automatically leptophobic .",
    "the coloron , in the case of flavor - universal couplings  @xcite , can arise from a simple renormalizable extension of the sm  @xcite .",
    "although its low - energy effects are usually negligible ( in contrast to the case of flavor - dependent couplings @xcite ) , the coloron can modify higgs production via gluon - fusion @xcite .    in section  [ sec :",
    "models ] we present some simple renormalizable models that include a @xmath0 boson coupled to baryon number ( @xmath13 ) or a coloron ( @xmath14 ) . in section  [ sec : searches ] we use the existing experimental limits on the effective rate to derive the limits in the coupling  mass plane for @xmath13 , and also for @xmath14 .",
    "section iv includes our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present some renormalizable models of spin-1 particles that are either color singlets ( @xmath0 ) or octets ( coloron ) and couple to quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "each coupling of a @xmath0 boson to a quark or a lepton is in principle a free parameter . in practice , though , there are various theoretical and phenomenological constraints on these couplings . massive spin-1 particles , such as @xmath0 bosons , must be either bound states or else be associated with a spontaneously - broken gauge symmetry , the simplest case being a new @xmath15 group . at hadron colliders , in order to discover a dijet resonance before a dilepton resonance , some of the @xmath0 couplings to quarks must be more than an order of magnitude larger than all @xmath0 couplings to leptons .    in the limit where the tree - level couplings to leptons vanish , the case of a leptophobic @xmath0 , there are severe constraints from the requirement of anomaly cancellations .",
    "these form a set of linear , quadratic and cubic equations in the @xmath15 charges , which must have as a solution a set of commensurate numbers ( _ i.e. _ , a set of integers upon a rescaling of the gauge coupling ) . despite the intricacies of cubic equations for integers",
    ", it can be proven that there is always a solution in the presence of a certain set of fermions which are vectorlike with respect to the sm gauge group and chiral under @xmath15 @xcite . to have a viable model , however , the number of new fermions can not be too large , and their properties must avoid various phenomenological constraints .",
    "let us construct some viable models where the @xmath11 symmetry associated with baryon number is gauged , _",
    "i.e. _ , all sm quarks have @xmath11 charge 1/3 , while all sm leptons and bosons have charge 0 .",
    "this choice is convenient because the sm mechanism for generating quark masses is not affected by the additional gauge symmetry , and furthermore the @xmath0 couplings to quarks are flavor blind .",
    "we construct a class of explicit models of this type that include @xmath16 sets of vectorlike quarks ( color - triplets ) transforming under @xmath17 as doublets , @xmath18 , or singlets , @xmath19 ; here @xmath20 labels their flavor .",
    "although these new fermions do not introduce anomalies involving only sm gauge groups , the @xmath11 charges of the vectorlike quarks are restricted by anomaly cancellation .",
    "the @xmath21 ^ 2 u(1)_b$ ] , @xmath22 ^ 2 u(1)_b$ ] and @xmath23 ^ 2u(1)_b$ ] anomalies cancel only if @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath11 charge of @xmath26 , etc .",
    "the @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] anomaly then cancels only if @xmath28 it follows that there is no @xmath11 gauge - gravitational anomaly , and finally , the @xmath29 ^ 3 $ ] anomaly cancels only if @xmath30 we will refer to the @xmath31 solution as the _ d = u _ model , and to the @xmath32 solution as the _",
    "d=7u+3 _ model .",
    "both these models are in fact families of @xmath11 charges for the vectorlike quarks described by a rational parameter ( @xmath33 ) and an integer @xmath16 ( the number of vectorlike flavors ) .",
    ".fields carrying @xmath11 charge . with the exception of @xmath34 ( a color - singlet scalar ) ,",
    "all fields shown here are color - triplet fermions .",
    "the charge assignments labelled by @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to the two solutions of the @xmath29 ^ 3 $ ] anomaly cancellation condition .",
    "the sm quarks have a generation index , @xmath37 , and the vectorlike quarks have a flavor index @xmath38 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for each mass point and collider , we simulate an event sample of on - shell @xmath1-channel @xmath13 as well as coloron production ( at leading order ) with subsequent decay to light - flavor and @xmath39 jets using madgraph 5 v1.5.7  @xcite with the cteq6l1 pdfs  @xcite .",
    "each event is passed through pythia v6.4.20  @xcite for showering and hadronization , and then through pgs v4  @xcite for basic detector simulation and jet clustering .",
    "choosing @xmath40 for the @xmath13 or @xmath41 for the coloron , we obtain the cross section times branching fraction from madgraph 5 , denoted @xmath42 , as a function of mass for each collider .",
    "we then implement the various triggers and cuts as described in each analysis listed in table  [ table : expts ] , to obtain an acceptance @xmath43 .",
    "the ratio of the resulting simulated effective rate , @xmath44 , to the limit from each relevant analysis in table  [ table : expts ] allows us to extract the upper limit on the coupling as a function of mass : @xmath45 and similarly for @xmath46 .",
    "we now discuss the most relevant searches , grouped according to the mass range probed .",
    "although a couple of searches ( from ua2 and cdf , see table ii ) extend to masses below 140 gev , we do not use them because those results were based on a subtraction of the expected @xmath48 and @xmath49 dijet distribution calculated at @xmath50 ; modern precision of @xmath48 and @xmath49 two - dijet distributions far exceeds the interpretative power of the effective rate limit in the @xmath51 gev mass window .",
    "for studies of theoretical constraints on colorons in that mass range , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the @xmath52 gev mass range ,",
    "by far the largest data sample ( 10.9 pb@xmath53 ) has been analyzed  @xcite by the ua2 experiment at the cern sps collider , which operated mainly at @xmath54 gev .",
    "mapping the ua2 limit to the coupling  mass plane is simpler than the procedure required for later analyses because the ua2 analysis includes a table of efficiencies for selecting the signal events from background as well as for isolating the peak feature in the signal events ( cf .",
    "table 1 and table 2 of ref .",
    "we linearly interpolate this overall efficiency to obtain a combined acceptance times efficiency factor . finally ,",
    "since the ua2 constraint is presented as a branching fraction limit on a sequential sm @xmath55 , we unfold the @xmath55 cross section to obtain an estimated @xmath56 limit , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . after applying the overall efficiency ,",
    "we obtain an effective rate limit from ua2 , which we then map into the upper limit on the @xmath13 coupling shown on the left - hand side of figure [ fig : zplimits ] .",
    "the cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite searches using the full data samples ( @xmath57 pb@xmath53 ) of the run i at the tevatron compete for the best limit in the @xmath58 gev mass window .",
    "we choose to extract a limit from the cdf analysis , because it applies to a larger mass range .    above @xmath59 gev ,",
    "the cdf analysis using 1.1 fb@xmath53 of run ii data  @xcite supersedes the run i results . for the @xmath60 gev window ,",
    "the only atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite searches use very small @xmath6 tev data sets .",
    "the most competitive of these is the 0.13 fb@xmath53 cms  @xcite analysis via so - called `` data scouting '' , which uses a reduced data format to record events with sensitivity at low masses even during high instantaneous luminosity conditions .",
    "we implement the appropriate trigger and analysis requirements for each mass point probed by these cdf and cms analyses to calculate their respective acceptances needed for the coupling  mass mapping .",
    "for all cms limits , we adopt their @xmath61 resonance constraint , since our spin-1 resonances only couple ( at leading order ) to @xmath62 ( note that the radiation patterns from @xmath61 and @xmath62 final states are indistinguishable ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : zplimits ] , the cdf limits on spin-1 resonances are the most stringent ones , even though they are based on only a tenth of the run ii data .",
    "most atlas and cms searches begin at about 900 gev . for the @xmath63 gev range",
    ", the atlas 1 fb@xmath53 search  @xcite is expected to be the most sensitive , as it has higher energy than cdf 1.1 fb@xmath53  @xcite , and a larger data sample than the other atlas  @xcite and cms studies  @xcite .    from @xmath64 tev , the cms 4.0 fb@xmath53 search using 8 tev data  @xcite is expected to be competitive with the earlier 7 tev atlas 4.8 fb@xmath53  @xcite and cms 5.0 fb@xmath53 analyses  @xcite , superseding the atlas and cms 1 fb@xmath53 analyses  @xcite . the slightly smaller amount of integrated luminosity analyzed in ref .  @xcite compared to refs .",
    "@xcite is counterbalanced by the slight increase in collider energy , giving comparable coupling sensitivities .    above @xmath65 tev",
    ", the cms analysis  @xcite using 19.6 fb@xmath53 of @xmath7 tev data is expected to be the most sensitive ( we will refer to this search as cms 20 fb@xmath53 ) .",
    "this analysis is the most recent dijet resonance search and has sensitivity to resonances as heavy as 5 tev .",
    "nevertheless , upward fluctuations in the cms 20 fb@xmath53 limit actually leave some small gaps where the atlas  @xcite @xmath66 fb@xmath53 limit and the cms @xmath67 fb@xmath53 limits are more stringent ( see figures [ fig : zplimits ] and [ fig : colimits ] ) .",
    "for the various cms analyses , we implement the respective trigger and analysis cuts to tabulate the acceptance for each mass point and obtain an effective rate limit from the @xmath61 resonance constraint .",
    "for the 8 tev analyses we find that the acceptance grows from 38% to 50% for the @xmath68 signal ( and from 33% to 44% for the coloron ) when the mass grows from 1 tev to 2.5 tev , and is constant at larger masses .",
    "the atlas results , on the other hand , are presented as limits on gaussian resonances in the @xmath69 spectrum after trigger requirements , detector effects , and analysis cuts are implemented .",
    "this poses additional problems because the @xmath69 distribution produced by any particle decaying to a pair of jets would be quite different from a gaussian : a long tail at low invariant mass is induced by imperfect recapturing of final state radiation . to overcome this mismatch",
    ", we form the @xmath69 spectrum after cuts and then model and apply a gaussian core efficiency ( @xmath70 ) for our signal , which is an additional factor beyond the canonical acceptance .",
    "our procedure of determining @xmath70 is described in the appendix .",
    "the atlas limits are given for a variety of gaussian widths : for each atlas limit , we adopt the smallest gaussian width constraint in performing our mapping , since our resonances typically have intrinsic widths at the percent and sub - percent level .",
    "following the procedure described in section  [ subsec : procedure ] for the leading experimental dijet limits , we obtain the coupling  mass mapping shown in figure  [ fig : zplimits ] for a spin-1 resonance @xmath13 .",
    "we have used the leading order production computed with madgraph 5 .    if the nlo corrections to the process @xmath71 are included in an event generator , then the mapping can be performed more precisely .",
    "we do not expect that they would change the values of @xmath72 by more than @xmath73 .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike the usual @xmath74 limit plots , figure  [ fig : zplimits ] readily shows the exclusion in coupling as well as mass .",
    "this mapping also demonstrates the complicated interplay between different experimental analyses using different colliders and luminosities .    from figure",
    "[ fig : zplimits ] , we conclude that @xmath13 bosons are unconstrained for a gauge coupling @xmath75 , leaving a large area of parameter space unexplored by dijet resonance searches so far .",
    "moreover , for the entire sub - tev region , the experimental limits allow for @xmath72 couplings as large as 0.9 , while locally , @xmath72 couplings can reach @xmath76 .",
    "importantly , an update from cdf or an analysis by d0 with their full @xmath77 fb@xmath53 run ii datasets could offer evidence for or provide interesting limits on new sub - tev dijet resonances .",
    "we also note that an update of the `` scouted data '' analysis @xcite with more luminosity by cms ( and atlas ) would also push sensitivity to lower couplings in the several hundred gev mass range .",
    "the plot is not extended above @xmath78 , because the @xmath11 coupling constant is already large , @xmath79 , so that it is difficult to avoid a landau pole .",
    "for that large coupling , the current mass reach is around 2.8 tev .",
    "the 14 tev lhc will extend significantly the mass reach , and can probe smaller couplings once enough data is analyzed .",
    "note that couplings of @xmath80 can be viewed as typical ( the analogous coupling of the photon is approximately 0.3 ) , and even @xmath72 as small as 0.01 would not be very surprising .",
    "we also present the coupling  mass mapping for colorons in figure  [ fig : colimits ] . for clarity",
    ", we only show the envelope of the strongest @xmath81 upper limits from all available analyses at each coloron mass .",
    "this mapping is performed again using leading order production .",
    "the nlo corrections to coloron production have been computed recently @xcite , and can vary between roughly @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we do not take the nlo corrections into account as we do not have an event generator that includes them ; furthermore , there is some model dependence in the nlo corrections at small @xmath81 ( for example , they are sensitive to the color - octet scalar present in recom  @xcite ) .    as mentioned in section  [ subsec : coloron ] , in the minimal coloron model there is a theoretical lower limit imposed by perturbativity , @xmath84 .",
    "the experimental upper limit dips below that value only in the @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 tev mass ranges . in non - minimal models , where there are vectorlike quarks or a second coloron , @xmath81 can be substantially smaller than 0.15 .",
    "thus , searches for colorons should continue even after they rule out @xmath87 in some mass windows .",
    "on the contrary , the discovery of a coloron with @xmath88 would imply the existence of additional colored particles that can be probed in hadron collisions .    unlike the @xmath15 gauge bosons",
    ", the coloron can be rather strongly coupled before reaching the perturbative upper limit , @xmath89 , because it is associated with a non - abelian gauge interaction that is asymptotically free .",
    "there is , however , a tighter upper limit on @xmath81 if the total width , @xmath90 [ see eq .",
    "( [ coloron - width ] ) ] , is required to be smaller than the dijet resolution .",
    "a ratio of the total width to @xmath91 of 15% ( as used in @xcite ) corresponds to @xmath92 for @xmath93 ( with a mild dependence on @xmath91 due to the running of @xmath94 ) , and to slightly larger @xmath81 for smaller masses , as shown in figure  [ fig : colimits ] .",
    "limits above the line marked there by  wide resonance \" are not reliable if set by narrow resonance searches @xcite . clearly , resonances that have a much broader intrinsic width than the experimental @xmath69 resolution will fade more easily into the exponentially falling qcd background . separately , for large enough coupling , the @xmath95-channel exchange of a coloron starts contributing significantly to the dijet signal , further diluting the @xmath69 peak .",
    "note also that at resonance masses approaching the total @xmath5 of the collider , pdf uncertainties increase .",
    "we urge the experimental collaborations to present limits ( or contours if a signal is observed ) on dijet resonances in the coupling - versus - mass plane of a ",
    "baryonic \" @xmath13 , as in figure  [ fig : zplimits ] ( or a coloron as in figure  [ fig : colimits ] , if the search is sensitive primarily to large signals arising from heavy resonances ) .",
    "this coupling  mass mapping , while being somewhat model dependent ( and thus a complement to  not a replacement for  the cross - section limit plots ) , has multiple advantages .",
    "first , it allows a comparison of limits set by experiments performed at different colliders , and at different center - of - mass energies .",
    "second , it allows an assessment of how stringent the experimental limits are , by comparing them with the expected range of the physical coupling .",
    "third , it provides a direct interpretation , without the need for mc simulations to compute the acceptance or to convert limits on a gaussian into limits on a realistic particle ( in the case of the existing atlas results ) .",
    "the coupling  mass mapping also highlights gaps in the combined sensitivity of all existing searches .",
    "figure  [ fig : zplimits ] shows that the coupling reach is rather poor in the mass range of 700900 gev , and it is even worse for masses below about 300 gev . a new analysis by cdf or d0 with the full run ii data set could have great impact there .",
    "non - conventional methods , such as analyzing scouted data @xcite , are also important for extending the sensitivity of lhc experiments in the sub - tev mass range .",
    "more generally , the traditional trend for each new dijet search to attain ever higher mass reach does not need to leave the ( equally important ) small - coupling region unexplored .",
    "we have argued that the simplest origin of narrow dijet resonances is a spin-1 particle with flavor - independent couplings .",
    "our mapping thus focused on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the same procedure can also be applied to other spins or color representations @xcite , but the results would be different because of pdf dependencies and radiation patterns of the decay products .    the overview of theoretical and experimental status of dijet resonances included in this paper is not exhaustive .",
    "for example , we have not discussed angular correlations , which complement the information contained in the @xmath69 distribution .",
    "we also note that any particle that produces a dijet resonance can also be produced in association with a @xmath48 , a @xmath49 or a photon .",
    "even though the cross sections for these associated productions are much smaller @xcite , the searches for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 benefit from better triggers that extend sensitivity to lower resonance masses compared to the pure dijet resonance searches .    the coupling ",
    "mass plane can and should be used for any resonance search ( as it has been done in some cases , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in particular , the @xmath99 resonance searches can be interpreted in terms of the same @xmath13 or coloron . for these flavor - blind particles",
    ", it would also be interesting to investigate the complementarity between @xmath99 and dijet resonance searches .",
    "if a dijet resonance will be discovered in the absence of a dilepton resonance at the same mass , it is likely that additional colored particles will remain to be discovered . to see this , recall ( from section [ sec : models ] )",
    "that the @xmath13 requires some vectorlike fermions to cancel the gauge anomalies , while the coloron requires at least some scalars from the gauge symmetry breaking sector .",
