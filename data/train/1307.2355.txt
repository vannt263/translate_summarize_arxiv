    ", we provide a quantitative treatment of the lensing effects due to gravitational waves ( gw ) that are the tensor metric perturbations , and make a comparative study of the lensing effects due to lss and gw . this analysis is carried out in both , real space ( by following the correlation function method as outlined in @xcite and extending the approach to include lensing due to gw s ) as well as in harmonic space .",
    "we find that there exist interesting similarities in the structure of the lensing kernels associated with lss and gw , for the case of temperature as well as for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes of cmb polarization . we correct errors in the lensing kernels in existing literature @xcite , which are used to derive modifications to the polarization power spectra due to lensing by gw .",
    "the robustness of these new results is established by checking that the temperature and polarization power spectra derived using the full - sky harmonic space analysis match those obtained by the independent real - space correlation function analysis .",
    "we are thus able to completely address the case of lensing by gw and provide an illuminating comparison that brings forth interesting similarity in the form of the expression with the complementary case of lensing due to lss .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : introlensing ] , we start with a brief introduction to the theory of weak lensing and we introduce necessary terminology which is extensively used in the rest of the article . in section [ sec : similarity ] , we begin by briefly describing the outline of evaluating the lensing modifications to the cmb angular power spectra , following which , we discuss the curious similarities that exist in the structures of the lensing kernels arising from lensing due to lss and gw . since we correct the full - sky harmonic - space lensing kernels , we provide explicit details on the calculations in appendixes [ app : polharspace2 ] and [ app : polharspace1 ] . for the full sky real space lensing kernels",

    "the cmb photons arrive at us starting from the surface of last scattering , where the optical depth for these photons reaches a null .",
    "the cmb photons then transverse through a perturbed metric before reaching redshift @xmath2 , where they are measured . owing to these perturbations in the cosmological metric ,",
    "the trajectories of the cmb photons deviate mildly from the ones that would have been in an unperturbed metric .",
    "the perturbations in the cosmological metric can be decomposed into two independently evolving parts , namely , scalar density perturbations which are associated with the lss in the universe and the tensor perturbations which are associated with gws in the universe .",
    "both these components are responsible for perturbing the photon trajectories , however they differ in the nature of deflections that they introduce .",
    "the resultant phenomena is termed as lensing and has been shown to leave measurable imprint on the two point and three point correlation function of the cmb temperature anisotropy and polarization fields .",
    "consequently , weak lensing of the cmb photons results in a remapping of the cmb temperature anisotropies @xmath3 and the cmb polarization field @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a vector field on the celestial sphere which denotes the deflection in the direction of photon arrival .",

    ", the two point statistic for the photon deflections is completely characterized by specifying the angular power spectrum for the scalar field @xmath13 and the pseudo - scalar field @xmath14 .",

    "it can be shown , by solving the geodesic equation for the photon trajectory , that the scalar field @xmath11 introduced in , is related to the weyl potential through the following equation , @xmath16 where the @xmath17 s denote the angular diameter distances , @xmath18 denotes the radial coordinate distance of the gravitational potential and @xmath19 denotes the radial co - ordinate distance to the last scattering surface .",
