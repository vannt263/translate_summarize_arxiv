    "a tpc has been used in an experiment searching for @xmath4-e conversion @xcite . in the mev energy range ,",
    "the tpc s involved are of smaller size .",
    "first double beta decay spectra were obtained by elliot et al .",
    "@xcite using a tpc of about 100 @xmath5 . in the gothard experiment @xcite , a tpc with an active volume of 200 @xmath5 provided one of the best limits on neutrinoless double beta decay in @xmath6xe .",
    "tpc with optical readout were also considered for dark matter searches @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the munu collaboration has built a 1 m@xmath0 gas tpc for the experimental study of @xmath7 scattering near a nuclear reactor in bugey ( france ) .",
    "the detector is designed to identify recoil electrons and reconstruct particle tracks well below 1 mev .",
    "the tracking capability of the tpc ( angle , threshold , and track containment ) is essential for background rejection and allows online background measurements .",
    "the tpc vessel is made of transparent acrylic and is installed inside a 10 m@xmath0 light collection vessel , filled with liquid scintillator and viewed by phototubes . both the electrec current and the scintillation light of particles interaction in the tpc gas can be collected . in the following section , a description of the detector",
    "is given whereas in section iii the energy and efficiency calibrations of the detector are described .",
    "waveforms and event identification are presented in section iv . in section v the energy and angular resolutions are discussed .",
    "incident gamma energy reconstruction is also presented .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "the general concept of the munu experiment and its detector have been presented previously @xcite . here",
    "we give an update and discuss the performances of the detector .",
    "the detector consists of a central tpc filled with cf@xmath8 gas , inside a peripheral light collection vessel filled with 10 m@xmath0 of liquid scintillator .",
    "it is equiped with photomultipliers and can act as veto for compton and cosmic events .",
    "the detector shown in figure [ fi : detector ] is installed inside low activity passive shieldings composed of borated polyethylene ( 8 cm thick ) and lead ( 15 cm thick ) .",
    "the 1 m@xmath9 time projection chamber can be filled with cf@xmath8 gas at a pressure between 1 and 5 bar .",
    "this gas was chosen because of its high density ( 1.06@xmath10 10@xmath11 electrons per cm@xmath9 at stp ) and its low z. this gives a high target density combined with relatively little multiple scattering .",
    "most data , in particular all those reported in this paper , have been taken at a pressure of 3 bar , at which electron tracks can be reasonably well resolved down to 300 kev .",
    "the gas is contained in a cylindrical acrylic vessel of 90 cm inner diameter , and with an inner length of 162 cm . a cathode made from high purity electrolytic copper foil",
    "is mounted on one lid . a read - out plane consisting , from inside to outside , of a grid , an anode plane and an x - y pick - up plane ,",
    "is mounted on the other side .",
    "the arrangement is shown in figure [ fi : tpc_efield ] .",
    "the grid wires have a diameter of 100 @xmath4 m .",
    "the distance between grid wires is 4.95 mm .",
    "the anode plane has 20 @xmath4 m anode wires , separated by 100 @xmath4 m potential wires .",
    "the distance between anode and potential wires is also 4.95 mm .",
    "the distance from the anode to the x - y plane is 3 mm whereas the grid and the anode plane are separated by a 8.5 mm gap .",
    "the spacing between x strips on one side of the supporting pet foil , or y strips on the other side , is 3.5 mm , giving in total 256 x and 256 y strips .",
    "the drift field is defined by the cathode , the read - out plane , primarily the grid , and the field shaping rings mounted on the outside of the acrylic vessel .",
    "the x - y plane is grounded through the read - out preamplifiers . the drift time and drift velocity",
    "are optimized in order to get the best spatial resolution . at 3 bar ,",
    "we are operating the tpc with a drift field of 206 v / cm .",
    "this gives a drift velocity of 2.14 cm.@xmath4s@xmath13 , and a total drift time of 74.8 @xmath4s .",
    "this was determined from the total drift time of muon tracks spanning the entire chamber , from cathode to grid .",
    "the voltages applied to the last field shaping ring , the grid , the anode and the potential wires must lead to sufficient amplification around the anode wires .",
    "moreover they must provide a symmetric field configuration around the anode wires to minimize mechanical strain and sagging , and a homogeneous drift field all the way down to the grid over the entire area .",
    "the garfield code was used to find a configuration meeting these requirements .",
    "it is shown in figure [ fi : tpc_efield ] .",
    "gas purity is essential for good charge collection , but also to minimize contributions to the background from radon emanations .",
    "the cf@xmath8 gas is therefore constantly circulated at a flow rate of 500 l / h through a commercial high temperature getter made by saes @xcite followed by a cold trap .",
    "the cold trap consists of a coil tubing followed by a a cell filled with 50 g of active charcoal .",
    "it is immersed in an ethanol bath kept at a temperature of 190 @xmath14k .",
    "the signals from the x and y strips and the anode are amplified in current voltage preamplifiers and sampled at 12.5 mhz ( 80 ns sampling time ) in 12 bit fadc s with logarithmic response .",
    "electronics noise on the x and y strips is serious , because of the length , over 2 m , of the flat signal cables from the tpc to the preamplifiers located outside the polyethylene , lead and steel shielding .",
    "a simple procedure allows to significantly reduce it .",
    "first a fourier transform of the signals is performed .",
    "frequency peaks identified as noise sources are eliminated .",
    "the loss in spatial resolution is acceptable .",
    "to give an idea of the quality of the tracks , an example is shown in figure [ fi:2460_11 ] .",
    "the tpc vessel is immersed in a cylindrical steel tank painted with tio2 for diffuse reflection and filled with a mineral oil based liquid scintillator ( ne235 , provided by nuclear enterprise , scotland ) .",
    "the scintillator has an attenuation length of 8 m at 430 nm and is viewed by 48 hemispherical photomultipliers of 20 cm diameter ( emi 9351 low activity series , provided by hamamatzu photonics ) , subdivided in two groups of 24 each on the anode and cathode sides .",
    "the mean quantum efficiency of the photocathodes is around 25 % .",
    "the pmt s are sampled with the same fadc s as the tpc anode and x - y strips .",
    "radioactive sources can be introduce into the light collection vessel at an axial distance of 26 cm from the center of the detector , on the anode side through an acrylic pipe .",
    "the radial position can be as close as 1 cm from the tpc lateral wall .",
    "the main role of the external detector is to identify and to reject the compton electrons induced by @xmath15 rays coming from outside as well as from inside the tpc .",
    "since the tpc walls are made of transparent acrylic , the scintillation light of the cf@xmath1 can also be collected . within the tpc",
    ", the primary scintillation light of cf@xmath1 can be emitted anywhere while avalanche scintillation light is produced only in the vicinity of the anode plane during the amplification process .",
    "the scintillation light spectrum of cf@xmath1 has a narrow maximum at 160 nm and a broader one around 300 nm @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the light is detected by the phototubes through the acrylic walls and the liquid scintillator . due to the transmittance of the acrylic and of the liquid scintillator ,",
    "only a fraction of about 10 % of the spectrum with wavelengths larger than 400 nm makes significant contribution to the light signal in our detector .",
    "as already mentionned , anode , x - y strips and phototube signals are read out with 8 bits flash adc s with logarithmic response .",
    "the memory size is 1024 words .",
    "the sampling interval is 80 ns and is given by a common clock .",
    "this sampling time is well ajusted to the electric pulses from the anode which have a relatively slow rise time of few hundred ns .",
    "signal pulses from the phototubes associated with compton electrons are much faster ( @xmath16 30 ns ) and are shaped to meet the sampling frequency .",
    "the digitized data of the flash adc s provide the pulse shape of the signals delivered by the phototubes , the anode , and the x - y strips .",
    "this way , projection on the x - y planes can be reconstructed .",
    "time bins can be converted to relative position coordinate along the tpc z - axis using the drift velocity in the tpc ( 2.14 cm.@xmath4s@xmath13 in normal running conditions ) .",
    "the scintillation light produced in the liquid scintillator or the primary scintillation light of the cf@xmath1 which is strong enough to be seen for @xmath2 particles and not for nearly minimum ionizing electrons and muons , are collected within one or two sampling bins of 80 ns .",
    "charges arrive to the anode with a time delay proportional to their distances from the anode plane .",
    "absolute z position can thus be defined for events with prompt scintillation light . for events such as confined single electrons , which have no primary scintillation light in cf@xmath1 and no interaction with the liquid scintillator",
    ", only relative z positions can be obtained .",
    "in the following , we first discuss the light collection and energy calibration for the liquid scintillator detector .",
    "in particular , we discuss the @xmath15 ray detection efficiency and we compare the measurements to simulations .",
    "we then describe the energy calibration of the tpc .      in the light collection vessel ,",
    "@xmath15 rays undergo multiple compton scattering and are in most cases totally absorbed within the scintillator liquid . radioactive sources ( @xmath3mn , @xmath17cs , @xmath18na )",
    "are used for light collection and energy calibrations . along the cylindrical vessel axis ( z ) , a convenient position parameter is the assymetry ( i.e. difference - to - sum ratio ) of light signals collected by phototubes of the cathode and anode sides . the light collection has been measured as function of this parameter using the total absorption peak of a @xmath3mn source .",
    "experimental data agree with simulations based on known emission spectrum and attenuation length of the liquid scintillator , quantum efficiency of the phototubes , and optical properties of other components . at the central part of the vessel ,",
    "the response is quite homogeneous over a large region ( @xmath19 40 cm from the center along the detector axis ) where about 7.5@xmath20 of photons emitted in the liquid scintillator are collected . at 80 cm from the center , close to both ends of the tpc , the fraction of light collected is 9.5@xmath20 .",
    "it increases to 15 @xmath20 at 120 cm from the center of the detector .",
    "position dependence of the light collection can be corrected for an optimum energy resolution or exploited for event localization .",
    "the quantity of photoelectrons collected was also evaluated from total absorption spectra of @xmath3mn measured for each individual phototube and compared to single photoelectron spectra . for an energy deposition of 1 mev at the central part of the detector , 144 @xmath19",
    "8 photoelectrons were collected in the 48 phototubes while 150 were predicted .",
    "total absorption spectra obtained with different radioactive sources and corrected for position dependence are compared to simulations in figure [ fi : mnac ] .",
    "the energy resolution is 13@xmath20 at 1 mev . in the following text ,",
    "only corrected values of energy will be used .",
    "cf@xmath1 is composed of low z atoms , only a small amount of very low energy @xmath15 rays will lose the entire energy in the gas . most of them undergo a single compton scattering in the gas and are absorbed in the scintillator . the munu detector has been designed for an optimum detection of @xmath15 rays associated with a compton electron inside the tpc . to minimize @xmath15 absorption ,",
    "the lateral walls of tpc are made of very thin ( 5 mm ) acrylic . at an energy , threshold set at 100 kev which corresponds to a total collection of 15 photoelectrons , the contributions of dark noise from individual phototubes",
    "is not negligeable . for this reason",
    "a multiplicity criteria asking for at least 5 phototubes hit is required for a trigger .",
    "the counting rate for the 10 m@xmath9 of liquid scintillator within the shielding is 710 s@xmath13 including 270 s@xmath13 coming from cosmic muons .",
    "the energy spectrum measured at @xmath21 100 kev ( low ) threshold shown in figure [ fi : ac1 ] corresponds to a counting rate of 0.05 s@xmath13 kg@xmath13 of liquid scintillator .",
    "signals from the scintillator can be applied to collect or to veto tpc events associated with a scattered @xmath15 ray .",
    "( similarly , a signal at an energy threshold of @xmath21 8 mev electron equivalent can be applied to veto cosmic muons ) .",
    "the detection efficiency of scattered @xmath15 has been measured by using a @xmath3mn source of 15 kbq inserted at 1 cm from the tpc wall .",
    "electron energy spectra were collected with and without the anti - compton veto operating at 100 kev hardware threshold .",
    "the anti - compton efficiency is evaluated from the ratio of the two electron spectra , corrected from background contributions measured in the absence of the radioactive source .",
    "only 3@xmath20 of the @xmath15 associated with a compton electron of more than 300 kev escape detection .",
    "the scattered photon is lost when it does not interact with the liquid scintillator or when it is absorbed by inert material inside the vessel(acrylic walls , cables ) .",
    "figure [ fi : eff ] shows the comparison of the experimental results to simulations at two thresholds : 100 and 125 kev @xcite . for a @xmath15 ray coming from outside the light collection vessel , the inefficiency is much smaller , since it has to travel twice through about 50 cm of liquid scintillator .",
    "taking also into account the solid angle and the absorption due to the liquid scintillator , the simulation shows that the probability to miss a @xmath15 ray leaving more than 300 kev in the tpc is less than 10@xmath22 .",
    "particle tracks in the tpc produce charges which drift to the anode plane . there",
    "the charge is amplified and avalanche light is produced .",
    "light emission during the multiplication phase in cf@xmath1 has been previously observed@xcite . in our detector , about 2.10@xmath23 photoelectrons",
    "are collected per mev of electron .",
    "electric current signals are more sensitive to electromagnetic noises and have larger pedestal fluctuations .",
    "current and light waveforms from the same electron event will be shown in the following section .",
    "avalanche light signals have better bin to bin pedestal stability and are used instead of the electric current signals for energy evaluation and for determination of track ends .",
    "an event per event comparison shows the linear correlation between the amplitudes the two types of signals as given in figure [ fi : tpcac ] .",
    "compton electron spectra were obtained using a @xmath3mn source both from the electric current and the light and are compared to simulations in figure [ fi : mntpc ] .",
    "mean energy loss of muon events per unit length in the tpc is used to monitor day - to - day gain variations ( figure [ fi : gainmoni ] ) .",
    "the gain changes on the anode plane are mapped with alpha and muon events and are presented in figure [ fi : gainxy ] .",
    "the experimental area in bugey has an overhead shielding in heavy concrete equivalent to 20 m of water . compared to ground level",
    ", the cosmic muon flux is reduced by a factor of five .",
    "the muon counting rate is expected to be 65 s@xmath13 in the tpc and 270 s@xmath13 in the light collection vessel .",
    "a cosmic muon attaining the tpc has to cross more than 100 cm of liquid scintillator . with a mean energy lost of about 1.8 mev / cm",
    ", it leaves a very large prompt signal in the phototubes .",
    "this signal can be used as trigger to select muon events or to veto muon correlated events .",
    "the energy loss of cosmic muons in the cf@xmath1 covers an energy range from hundred kev to a few mev .",
    "the muon mean energy loss per unit length in the tpc can be used to continuously monitor the gain variations in a complementary way to the measurements with radioactive sources .",
    "muon events crossing both cathode and anode have x - y projection confined within the tpc radius and are used to evaluate the drift velocity . the time difference between the beginning and the end of the track correponding to a maximum drift path of 1.62 m. the x - z",

    "the spatial extensions of @xmath2 events are limited to a few x - y strips and a few time bins .",
    "while no primary scintillation light was seen for compton electrons at a threshold as low as 30 kev electron equivalent , the light from @xmath2 particles was detected .",
    "a prompt signal equivalent an 153 kev electron ( 22 photoelectrons ) is produced in the liquid scintillator by a 5.3 mev @xmath2 particles . in taking into account the light collection and photocathode quantum efficiency ,",
    "we find 1100 photons per @xmath2 particle or 207 @xmath19 30 photons / mev .",
    "this is compatible with values of 220 photons per mev in the range of 360 - 600 nm measured at lower pressures @xcite .",
    "+ the time difference between primary light and avalanche light signals of alpha particles emitted from the cathode provides an other measurement of the drift velocity .",
    "the total charge ( or avalanche light ) collected for @xmath2 particles is much smaller than for electrons of the same energy .",
    "a suppression factor as high as 28 has been measured for @xmath2 particle emitted close to the anode plane .",
    "this factor however decreases when the drift time ( i.e. distance from the anode ) increases ( figure [ fi : alphag ] ) . for alpha particles emitted from the cathode ,",
    "the suppression factor is only 5.6 .",
    "the charge suppression is very likely due to an screening effect in the avalanche region while the change of the suppression factor may be a consequence of electron diffusions along transverse(t ) as well as longitudinal(l ) directions . in the munu tpc , for a drift length of 1.62 m from the anode to the cathode ,",
    "the dispersion @xmath24 or @xmath25 is 2 mm , about half of the range of @xmath2 particles at 5 mev .",
    "the smearing of the charge density along the drift path could than attenuate the charge space screening effect in the avalanche region .",
    "radon was introduced accidentally into the tpc by one of the oxysorb @xcite purifiers used to clean the cf@xmath1 from oxygen and water . a maximun rate of 37 s@xmath26 was measured .",
    "alpha particles detected in the tpc came from the decay of @xmath27rn ( e@xmath28=5.48 mev ) and its radioactive daughters . in the radon @xmath27rn decay chain ,",

    "both the rates of @xmath2 events and of correlated @xmath31-@xmath2 events from @xmath29bi-@xmath29po decay cascade decreases with a period of 3.2 days compatible with that of @xmath27rn decay period ( figure [ fi : decay ] ) .",
    "after the cf@xmath1 gas change , residual @xmath2 events were still observed at a steady level of @xmath21 1 mbq / m@xmath9 of @xmath27rn in the gas and an activity of 17 @xmath4bq/@xmath32 from the cathode .",
    "for these last events , a well defined drift time and a well defined energy peak at 940 kev electron equivalent were observed .",
    "these events can be attributed to @xmath2 particles from @xmath33po decay , a radioactive daughter of @xmath33pb ( half life 22 years ) .",
    "radioactive daughters of @xmath27rn were very likely drifted to the surface of the copper cathode but apparently not deeply implanted into the metal .",

    "compton electron events generated within the tpc have in most cases an associated scattered @xmath15 ray detected in the light collection vessel .",
    "the sequence for a typical event , shown in figure [ fi : gammae ] is the following : + - first , scintillation light due to the absorption of the scattered @xmath15 ray in the liquid scintillator is detected , + - then , when ionisation charges of the compton electron have drifted to the anode plane , avalanche light is measured with a time delay proportional to the distance from the anode , + - almost simultaneously electric current signals are measured on the anode and x - y strips .",
    "+ the display of the event is completed by the reconstruction of the projections in the x - z / y - z and x - y planes .",
    "the localization of the gamma along the axis of the anti - compton can be evaluated from the assymetry of the light collection(see",
    "section iii.1 ) .",
    "the distribution of time differences of compton electrons and associated scattered @xmath15 s is flat along the tpc which indicates that the background is homogeneous along the tpc .",
    "a sharp drop corresponds to the end of the chamber .",
    "the drift velocity extracted this way is compatible with the muon result .",
    "for such events , charges are created next to the anode wires .",
    "thanks to a larger electric field and thus faster drift time between the grid and the anode the charges created in this region are collected much faster .",
    "the result is a charge blob at the end of the track on the anode side .",
    "if the electron stops inside the gas volume , the normal blob due to increased ionization before stopping will be seen in addition at the true end , resulting in a `` double blob '' event .",
    "normal blobs have a higher integrated charge than anode blobs while anode blobs have charges accumulated in the first or the second time bins at the start of the track .",
    "the avalanche light pulses are used to detect the sharp rise of pulse height and identify tracks originating from the anode plane . a typical `` double blob ''",
    "event is shown in figure [ fi : twoblob ] . + a distribution of pulse heights for an unselected set of electron events is shown in figure [ fi : scrise ] together with a distribution of compton electron events which do not cross the anode .",

    "the energy resolution of a wire chamber in proportional regime usually depends on the primary ionization statistics and mainly on the single electron avalanche response spectrum , which dominates in the present case of pure cf@xmath8 through a polya parameter @xmath39 already measured in ref @xcite .",

    "it has been built to study of @xmath49 scattering at the bugey reactor and to set a lower experimental limit on the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "it is particulary dedicated to detect low energy electrons and to reconstruct their energy and direction .",
    "one of the originalities of munu is the presence of the external light collection vessel .",
    "it sees the light produced by ionizing particles in its scintillator .",
    "this allows to eliminate cosmics related events as well as compton events occuring in the tpc .",
    "in addition the primary scintillation light produced by alphas is well resolved , which allows to identify these particles .",
    "for all these events the measurement of the primary light provides an absolute determination of the track position along the tpc axis .",
    "the primary light from minimum ionizing particles is too weak to be seen , but the light emitted at the anode during the amplification process gives a strong signal .",
    "it complements that from the anode signal , having even lower noise .",
    "it is very useful in characterising the topology of tracks , which will allow for a powerful event selection when analysing the data in terms of neutrino scattering .",
    "installed within low activity shieldings , the detector is now collecting neutrino induced electron events at the bugey reactor at a recoil electron threshold of 300 kev .",
    "+ the result of the reconstruction of the incident energy obtained with the 835 kev @xmath3mn source is encouraging and it shows that the spectroscopy of low energy neutrino is attainable .",
    "the background has to be however further suppressed .",
    "the ultimate goal is to use an upgraded munu detector underground , where the background conditions are optimal , and to look for solar neutrinos .",
