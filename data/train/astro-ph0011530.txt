    "the discovery that at least @xmath4 of solar type stars harbor jupiter - mass or larger bodies , often in small , eccentric orbits @xcite shows that planets are not exceptionally rare .",
    "the transiting planet orbiting hd 209458 has a mass of @xmath5 jupiter masses , and a radius about 1.4 times that of jupiter .",
    "clearly it is a gas giant like jupiter or saturn ; the minimum masses of the other known objects suggest that they are also gas giants .",
    "the doppler technique used for most of the discoveries can not find terrestrial mass objects in au scale orbits . what fraction of solar type stars have terrestrial - type planets ?",
    "how could an observer with our current technology located on a star in the solar neighborhood decide if there were any terrestrial - type bodies orbiting the sun ?",
    "more generally , how could such an observer estimate the fraction of solar type stars having companions of terrestrial ( as opposed to gas giant ) compositions ? in this paper we explore one possible way of addressing the latter question , stellar - mass dependent photospheric metallicity trends .",
    "in section [ pollution ] we argue that a few earth masses of rocky / icy material have accreted onto the sun over its lifetime . in section [ evidence ]",
    "we discuss one possible observational tracer of similar accretion occurring on other solar type stars . in section [ observations ]",
    "we examine a sample of stars with spectroscopically measured photospheric iron abundances [ fe / h ] , where @xmath6 is the mass abundance of iron in the photosphere of the star , and @xmath7 is the the mass abundance of iron in the photosphere of the sun .",
    "we compare the observations to monte carlo models of stellar pollution in section [ gamble ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section [ discussion ] and present our conclusion in the final section .",
    "the surface density @xmath8 of iron in our solar system follows a rough power law with distance from the sun @xcite .",
    "we have compiled recent estimates for the iron content of the planets in table  [ table_iron ] . from a least squares",
    "fit including venus , earth , and the four gas giants we find @xmath9 .",
    "weidenschilling noted a clear deficit of material in the region interior to venus , and between earth and jupiter , relative to this power law .",
    "gas drag acting on planetesimals near the sun could reduce the surface density of such bodies near the present orbit of mercury by dropping them onto the sun . because the solar convection zone was very deep for @xmath10 million years ( see figure  [ fig_conv_mass ] ) , while the gas disk that would have produced the drag is believed to have survived only a few million , this",
    "would not have altered the apparent metallicity of the sun .",
    "materiel in the asteroid belt clearly survived such gas drag .",
    "however , kirkwood noticed over one hundred years ago that the distribution of asteroids showed distinct gaps at the location of orbital resonances with jupiter @xcite .",
    "this suggests that material has been removed from the gaps under the influence of jupiter . over the last twenty years",
    ", the dynamics of this removal have been worked out in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "the gaps are the result of resonant , chaotic perturbations of the asteroid orbits by jupiter .",
    "a second feature , seen in plots of orbital eccentricity versus semimajor axis , is the result of a secular resonance , the @xmath11 resonance . in either type of resonance bodies with semimajor axis larger than about half that of jupiter s",
    "tend to be removed from the solar system ; their eccentricities grow with time , increasing their apoapses until they reach the orbit of jupiter .",
    "close encounters with that planet then quickly eject the asteroids .",
    "resonant asteroids in smaller orbits tend not to be ejected ; their apoapse does not reach the orbit of jupiter . instead , their periapses decrease until they hit the sun .",
    "several related mechanisms can combine to produce this decrease in periapse , but the two main actors are mean motion resonances and the @xmath11 resonance already mentioned . in a mean motion resonance such as that responsible for the @xmath12 kirkwood gap , the eccentricity of the resonant asteroid undergoes a random walk .",
    "since the eccentricity can not decrease below zero , there is a tendency for bodies with small @xmath13 to drift to larger @xmath13 . when the eccentricity is large enough , the asteroid strikes the sun @xcite .",
    "a small fraction will suffer close encounters with the earth or other terrestrial bodies ; this may lead to jupiter crossing orbits , which usually leads to ejection of the asteroid from the solar system .",
    "only a very small fraction will collide with either a terrestrial planet or jupiter . in the @xmath11 secular resonance",
    "the precession rate equals the sixth secular frequency of the solar system .",
    "this frequency appears with substantial amplitude in the orbital motion of both jupiter and saturn ; it is roughly the average precession rate of the latter planet .",
    "the @xmath11 resonance rapidly removes angular momentum from the orbit of the asteroid , dropping the periapse below the surface of the sun .",
    "these resonances are currently active , and are believed to be responsible for the bulk of the meteorites striking the earth . while there is no direct observational confirmation",
    ", it is virtually certain that a much larger flux of asteroidal material from these resonances is currently hitting the sun .",
    "it is also likely that the flux of asteroidal material was much larger in the past .",
    "the locations of both mean motion and secular resonances depends on the positions of jupiter and saturn , and on any massive gas disk .",
    "it has been suggested that as the protoplanetary gas disk dissipated the @xmath11 resonance swept through the belt , depleting much of the mass .",
    "more recently it has been suggested that one or both of jupiter and saturn migrated to their current positions , causing a similar sweeping of mean motion resonances .",
    "this would preferentially deplete the outer belt @xcite , but would also drop material from the inner belt onto the sun . finally , we note that the asteroid belt is hot , in the sense that the distribution of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 is broad .",
    "a number of authors have suggested that a planet size body swept through the region early in the history of the solar system , heating the belt as well as dropping material on the star @xcite .",
    "the surfaces of the terrestrial planets and the moon show evidence for an extended period of bombardment , known as the late heavy bombardment , lasting up to a billion years after their surfaces cooled .",
    "this is consistent with some of the longer lived depletion scenarios described above .    from table",
    "[ table_iron ] , the amount of material inferred to have populated the original asteroid belt is of order five to ten earth masses .",
    "roughly 2 - 5 earth masses would have been between the present position of mars and @xmath15 au , half the present semimajor axis of jupiter . a substantial fraction of this material , of order half , would have ended up in the sun .",
    "we will take @xmath16 as a representative number .",
    "meteoritic material is roughly @xmath17 iron by weight @xcite , so we take @xmath18 as the amount of iron that was dropped on the sun after the convection zone thinned .",
    "there is another possible piece of evidence besides the late heavy bombardment for such a late depletion of the asteroid belt . as we noted above",
    ", a substantial fraction of the `` missing '' material originally in the asteroid belt strikes the sun .",
    "this material will be mixed throughout the convection zone of the star . since a substantial bombardment of the terrestrial planets lasted for much longer than 100 million years",
    ", this material would have landed in a convection zone of mass @xmath19 .",
    "hence there is a possibility that the signature of solar bombardment was left in the form of an enhanced metallicity in the solar envelope .",
    "the mass of the convection zone was @xmath20 of the solar mass between @xmath21 and @xmath22 years , while the present mass fraction of iron observed in the photosphere is @xmath23 .",
    "this yields a total iron content of @xmath24 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 years . adding half an earth mass of iron would increase the observed @xmath25}$ ] by only @xmath26 dex .",
    "precision measurements of the bulk metallicity of a single solar type star are not presently available",
    ". measurements of the sound speed in the interior of the sun , using the five minute oscillations , could in principle provide such a measurement .",
    "the only work along these lines that we are aware of is the paper by henney & ulrich ( 1998 ) .",
    "they show that the addition of @xmath27 of cometary material results in a frequency shift that , because of uncertainties in solar models , is too small to be detected .    however , it is possible that observations of large numbers of stars could reveal the presence of pollution .",
    "for example , stars having a fixed metallicity but different masses will mix material dropped onto their surfaces to different depths .",
    "knowledge of the depth of this surface mixing layer , which we summarize in the next subsection , allows us to look for variations of metallicity with stellar mass produced by accreted material .",
    "material dropped onto the surface of a star will not in general be confined to the photosphere .",
    "the surface layers of stars less than about @xmath28 are convectively unstable , and any material dropped on the star is expected be mixed throughout the convection zone .",
    "observations of lithium ( li ) abundance provide support for this theoretical picture .",
    "but these same observations suggest that there is another form of mixing in stars more massive than @xmath29 , possibly related to meridional circulation .",
    "the evidence for the two types of mixing comes in the form of variations in the surface lithium abundance with stellar mass .",
    "lithium is destroyed when it is exposed to temperatures above about @xmath30 ; the temperature at the photosphere is much lower than this , so lithium depletion indicates that photospheric material is mixed down to regions where the temperature is higher .",
    "lithium could also be removed from the photosphere by simple settling ( so that the lithium is stored below the photosphere , as opposed to being destroyed ) or by stellar mass loss .",
    "however , the observations , which we review below , point to destruction by mixing .    observations show that for stars with mass below @xmath29 the photospheric abundance of lithium decreases rapidly with decreasing stellar mass , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "some depletion occurs before the main sequence , but there is strong evidence that depletion also occurs on the main sequence @xcite . the main sequence depletion is believed to be related to the increasing depth of the bottom of the surface convection zone with decreasing stellar mass in these stars , supplemented by some convective overshoot and/or settling in stars near the upper end of this mass range .",
    "stars above about @xmath31 have very thin , or even lack , convection zones . in standard stellar models , with no settling , mixing or mass loss , the surface li and be abundances are constant over the main sequence lifetime of such high mass stars .",
    "both li and be are destroyed below modest depths in the interiors of such stars .",
    "for stars in the mass range @xmath32-@xmath33 and having solar metallicity , our stellar models indicate that the nominally undepleted region has a mass of @xmath34 for li and @xmath35 for be .",
    "( we assume that the lithium is destroyed at temperatures above @xmath36k ) . at depths below those corresponding to these masses , li and",
    "be should be destroyed .    real stars with masses larger than @xmath31 do nt behave like the models .",
    "hyades stars show a distinct `` lithium dip '' centered around @xmath28 @xcite . between @xmath37 and @xmath28 the lithium abundance",
    "is seen to decrease with increasing stellar mass . from @xmath38",
    "to @xmath39 there is a sharp increase in lithium abundance .",
    "balachandran ( 1995 ) finds the highest abundances for stars with masses above @xmath39 ( the `` blue side '' of the dip ) and for stars of @xmath40 ( the `` red side '' of the dip ) ; these stars have abundances about equal to those found in meteorites @xcite , abundances which are generally believed to be primordial",
    ".    observations of young stellar clusters such as @xmath41 per and the pleiades find little evidence of lithium depletion in more massive stars @xcite . indeed",
    ", there is a strong correlation between cluster age and li abundance in the `` lithium dip '' between @xmath32 and @xmath39 , indicating that the depletion takes place on the main sequence on a time scale of 100 myrs or more @xcite .",
    "observations of clusters having different metallicities @xmath25}$ ] show that the location of the dip is slightly metallicity dependent @xcite .",
    "lower metallicity clusters have dips centered at lower masses .",
    "however , the high mass side of the dip depends only weakly on metallicity .",
    "as we noted above , the lithium depletion appears to be due to mixing rather than gravitational settling or stellar mass loss .",
    "two observations lead to this conclusion .",
    "first , surface depletions of lithium and beryllium are correlated , with the surface lithium diminishing more rapidly than surface beryllium @xcite . because the be rich zone has twice the mass of the li rich zone , mass loss",
    "would deplete all the li before depleting the surface be .",
    "similarly , settling predicts that surface li and be would be depleted at roughly the same rate .",
    "second , evolved stars with @xmath42 are also deficient in lithium @xcite ; settling of lithium would leave a non - depleted layer of lithium below the surface ( in the absence of mixing ) , which would be dredged up to the surface when the convection zone deepens .",
    "the fact that the predicted increase in evolved stars is not seen indicates that the li missing from main sequence stellar photospheres is destroyed rather than sequestered below the photosphere .    above @xmath39",
    "there appears to be little mixing of the upper layers of the star with deeper layers , since there is little li depletion .",
    "however , the lithium in these stars does appear to be destroyed in deeper layers ; evolved ( giant ) 1.6 solar mass stars are severely depleted @xcite .",
    "this depletion occurs inside the progenitors , below the photosphere @xcite , so that when the surface convection zone forms and then thickens , the surface lithium is mixed over a larger volume of depleted material , reducing the photospheric lithium abundance .",
    "the surface mixing seen in the dip appears to be rotationally induced @xcite , although this is far from certain .",
    "as already noted , stars in @xmath41 per and the pleiades clusters , with estimated ages of 50 and 70 million years , show little depletion in lithium abundance for stars between @xmath32 and @xmath43 solar masses , while stars in the hyades and older clusters show depletions that increase with cluster age .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the upper layers of the stars are mixed downward on time scales of @xmath44 million years .",
    "the observational data summarized here leads us to propose the following simple model for the mass @xmath45 of the surface mixing region in solar mass stars ( see figure [ fig_mixing_mass ] ) .",
    "we first describe the lithium dip .",
    "the location , in mass , of the dip is described by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , giving the low , central , and high mass points of the dip .",
    "these three masses depend on the stellar @xmath25}$ ] .",
    "above @xmath48 we assume @xmath49 ; we use @xmath50 , the value obtained for the meridonal circulation model of charbonnel et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "this number is currently unconstrained by observation on the low side , but must be less than @xmath51 to prevent li depletion .",
    "for @xmath52 we use a linear interpolation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the latter value ( for a star at the center of the dip ) allows for complete li depletion but only partial be depletion .",
    "we also use a linear interpolation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 . stars with",
    "@xmath58 appear to be only slightly depleted , so we take @xmath59 .    extrapolating from data in @xcite , we take @xmath60}\\\\ m_{central}/m_\\odot=&1.42 + 0.25{\\rm [ fe / h]}\\\\ m_{blue}/m_\\odot=&1.31 + 0.31{\\rm [ fe / h]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the high mass or blue side of the dip is essentially independent of @xmath25}$ ] . for stars with mass below @xmath46 , we take the mass of the convection zone ( @xmath61 ) plus the mass of the mixing zone @xmath56 of a @xmath46 star on the low mass or red edge of the dip .",
    "the mass of the convection zone at an age of @xmath21 years ( the mass at @xmath22 is similar , see figure [ fig_conv_mass ] ) is found from the following empirical fit , derived from our stellar models : [ eqn_cvz_mass ] m_cvz = a([fe / h])(m_-3-m_*)^3.65 , where @xmath62}\\right)=-0.2{\\rm [ fe / h]}+0.49 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the ( metallicity dependent ) stellar mass at which the convection zone mass equals @xmath64 , m_-3=a_-3[fe / h]+b_-3 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn_cvz_mass ] ) is very accurate near @xmath63 and good to about @xmath17 at @xmath67 .    our model for the depth of the mixing region in a solar metallicity star",
    "is shown in figure  ( [ fig_mixing_mass ] ) .",
    "note that stars of different metallicity will have `` lithium dips '' ( peaks in this figure ) at slightly different masses than those shown in the figure .",
    "armed with this model , we can predict the average change in metallicity of a sample of stars subjected to iron accretion .",
    "essentially we will look for behavior similar to that seen in the abundance of lithium .",
    "polluted low mass stars of a fixed age will show an increase in metallicity with increasing mass ( below the low mass end of the li dip , around 1.0 solar masses ) .",
    "intermediate mass polluted stars will show a decrease in [ fe / h ] with increasing mass , up to @xmath68 , followed by a sharp increase at @xmath48 .",
    "we want to stress that , while we are using the lithium data as a proxy to estimate the depth of the surface mixing layer of main sequence solar type stars , and while we anticipate that the surface abundances of lithium and iron will follow similar patterns , the reason for the abundance variations differ .",
    "the lithium abundances vary because lithimum is destroyed when it is mixed below the surface of the star .",
    "stars in the mass range we consider neither destroy nor create iron . rather , we assume that some iron is added to the surface of the star after it forms ; it is then diluted by the mixing process down to the same depth that the lithium is mixed to .",
    "in other words the variations in lithium are produced by the destruction of lithium inside the star , while the variations in iron are produced by the addition of iron from outside the star .",
    "in order to look for mass - dependent variations in [ fe / h ] , we must be able to estimate the masses of stars , and we must have reliable measurements of the metallicity . to find the mass of a star we need to know its luminosity , or alternately its absolute v magnitude @xmath69 , its colors ( we use @xmath70 ) , and its composition [ fe / h ] . the hipparcos catalogue gives parallaxes accurate to roughly one milliarcsecond for a selection of stars in the solar neighborhood , allowing us to find absolute magnitudes when",
    "we are given @xmath71 .",
    "we use simbad values for @xmath72 and @xmath71 .",
    "we take metallicities from the @xcite catalogue .",
    "this lists spectroscopically determined values for [ fe / h ] taken from the literature .",
    "we take all the hd stars in the cayrel de strobel et al .",
    "catalogue for which there are hipparcos parallaxes larger than 10 milliarcseconds ( corresponding to distances less than 100pc ) .",
    "we also require that the error in the parallax be less than 10 percent .",
    "since we are interested in main sequence stars that have masses less than about @xmath73 , we eliminate all stars with @xmath74 .",
    "we then fit the remaining stars to stellar tracks taken from a grid of models having @xmath75}\\le 0.5 $ ] in steps of @xmath76 dex , and masses in the range @xmath77 in steps of @xmath78 .",
    "the models are from the yale stellar evolution code .",
    "a star is defined to be evolved if it has a convection zone mass more than ten times larger than the mass of the surface mixing layer at an age of @xmath21 years , while the absolute @xmath71 magnitude has not decreased by more than @xmath79 .",
    "we refer to such stars as `` hertzsprung gap '' stars .",
    "this occurs roughly when the star leaves the main sequence .",
    "it is a useful definition because it allows us another check on the pollution scenario ; if pollution is occurring , the class of stars with convection zone masses ten times larger than their initial main sequence convection zone masses should show substantially lower [ fe / h ] values than their parent populations .",
    "if the absolute @xmath71 magnitude has decreased by more than @xmath79 , the star is considered to be a giant .",
    "because their surface gravities are so much lower than main sequence stars of the same mass , we hesitate to compare the metallicity trends of giants and dwarfs .    in the course of our analysis a problem with our stellar models became apparent .",
    "stars with @xmath80 were systematically found to be older than 20gyrs .",
    "we believe that this is due to a failure of our atmospheric models at these low effective temperature . for this reason we do not include any stars redder than this in our analysis ;",
    "this corresponds to stars with masses less than @xmath81 .",
    "at the other end of the mass spectrum , we felt confident in extrapolating up to masses of @xmath82 , @xmath78 beyond our grid .",
    "of the 650 stars in our sample , 466 were unevolved and had masses in the range @xmath83 .",
    "fifteen stars had convection zones 3 - 10 times larger than their main sequence value ( at @xmath21yrs ) ; we treated these as unevolved .",
    "nineteen stars had convection zones more than ten times as massive as the main sequence values ; these are our hertsprung gap stars .",
    "in figure  ( [ fig_age ] ) we plot @xmath25}$ ] against stellar age , while figure  ( [ fig_mass ] ) shows @xmath25}$ ] plotted against stellar mass . the metallicity decreases with increasing age , and increases with increasing mass .",
    "we also note that the hertzsprung gap stars tend to have lower metallicity than unevolved stars of the same age and mass .",
    "figure  ( [ fig_histogram ] ) shows the histogram of [ fe / h ] for our sample .",
    "it is well - fit by a gaussian with mean @xmath84}\\right>=-0.095 $ ] .",
    "the trend with stellar age is expected on the basis of chemical evolution ; younger stars are constructed using gas that has been contaminated by material processed in the interiors of massive stars .",
    "the more recent the stellar birth , the higher the fraction of processed material .",
    "the trend is seen even more clearly when we bin the data by age , as seen in figure  ( [ fig_age_bin ] ) .",
    "the slope of a least squares fit to the [ fe / h ] versus log(age ) curve is @xmath85 .",
    "the trend of increased metallicity with increased stellar mass might arise from the age - metallicity trend , combined with the short lifetimes of massive stars . since the stars we consider are either unevolved or only slightly evolved , they must have ages less than or roughly equal to their main sequence lifetimes .",
    "massive stars have short lifetimes , and hence low ages ( see figure  [ fig_age_mass ] ) .",
    "they will therefore be more metal rich , on average , than less massive stars .    in the next section",
    "we will show that , while part of the variation of metallicity with stellar mass is due to the age - metallicity relation , it is not the whole story .",
    "the data suggest a possible trend of surface [ fe / h ] with stellar mass . in order to evaluate the significance of this trend",
    ", we have undertaken monte carlo experiments to calculate the predicted metallicity of a population of polluted stars .",
    "we start by producing a population of unpolluted stars having the same characteristics as the cayrel de strobel - derived sample described above .",
    "this involves generating a sample of stars with mass roughly uniformly distributed between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with metallicities gaussian distributed about an age dependent mean . from our sample of stars and using a simple two parameter fit we find that the mean [ fe / h ] is given by = ( age)+ , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the width of the @xmath25}$ ] distribution is slightly age dependent , but we assume an age - independent width @xmath90 .    we constrain the stellar age to be less than the calculated lifetime of the star . as noted above we define the lifetime of a star to be the age at which the mass of the surface convection zone exceeds ten times the mass of the mixed surface layer at an age of 100 myrs .",
    "our stellar models have lifetimes ( as defined above ) which vary as the @xmath91 power of the stellar mass , l(m,[fe / h])=m_1([fe / h])(m_*m_)^-3.65 , where m_1([fe / h])=11.5 + 4.5[fe / h ] gyr is the lifetime of a one solar mass star of metallicity [ fe / h ] .    using this prescription",
    "we generate 466 stars , yielding the mass - age relationship depicted by the open circles in figure [ fig_age_mass ] ; the agreement with the observed age - mass relationship is very good .",
    "we can use this monte carlo model to see if the [ fe / h]-mass correlation seen in our sample could be due simply to the known age - mass and age-[fe / h ] correlation .",
    "to repeat , the idea is as follows : massive stars are necessarily young .",
    "young stars are metal rich , since they form out of gas that has been processed through many generations of high - mass ( supernova producing ) stars .",
    "thus more massive stars should have higher metallicity than less massive stars .",
    "this argument is partially borne out by the monte carlo model .",
    "we have adjusted the slope of the @xmath25}$ ] vs. logarithm of stellar age relation to obtain agreement with that seen in our sample ( @xmath85 dex per log(gyr ) ) , then examined the metallicity as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the stellar metallicities do show a dependence on stellar mass .",
    "however , the slope of the @xmath25}$ ] vs mass relation for the observed stars is @xmath92 dex per solar mass , while that of the unpolluted monte carlo model is @xmath93 , different by 3 standard deviations .",
    "a second indication that there is a real mass dependence in the data comes from allowing for a third parameter in a least squares fit .",
    "heretofore we have used a two parameter fit , an age - metallicity slope and an intercept .",
    "if we allow for a linear variation of [ fe / h ] with mass , the slope of the fit is a third parameter .",
    "a fit of the form [ fe / h]=a_1+a_2(age)+a_3(mm _ ) does give a significantly improved chi squared .    to see if this three parameter fit can really distinguish between a pure age dependence and a mixed age and mass dependence , we modified our monte carlo model to allow for a linear dependence of average metallicity on stellar mass .",
    "we then ran the resulting stars through our least squares routine .",
    "if we set the amount of added iron to zero but force an age dependence , the least squares fit finds the correct age - metallicity slope .",
    "it also correctly finds that there is no mass dependence , despite the apparent dependence in a metallicity versus mass plot . if we introduce a mass dependence into the model , the least squares fit correctly finds both the age and mass dependences . finally , we produced samples of stars with a mass dependence but no age dependence .",
    "a plot of metallicity versus age clearly shows a trend ; this is expected since we force the more massive stars , which are younger , to have higher metallicities . despite this apparent age - metallicity trend , the linear least squares fit finds the correct mass - metallicity slope , and a zero slope for the age - metallicity relation .",
    "these results suggest that the real data exhibits a mass trend independent of stellar age , though by itself the argument is not very convincing .",
    "more compelling evidence is obtained by comparing to more sophisticated models .",
    "the inadequacy of a simple age dependent metallicity is most clearly seen by examining the binned metallicity versus mass distribution , figure  ( [ fig_mass_bin ] ) .",
    "another indication is the poor @xmath94 of the fit ; the best unpolluted model , shown as the dotted line in the figure , gives @xmath95 for the binned distribution .",
    "we proceed to examine more realistic polluted models , which give substantially better fits to the data .",
    "as noted above , pollution introduces a third free parameter , the amount of iron added to the star . in the last subsection we assumed that @xmath25}$ ] increases linearly with stellar mass .",
    "this is not what we expect from pollution , since the mass of the surface mixing layer is not linear , or even monotonic with stellar mass . in this section",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution of accreted mass , with a variance equal to half the mean .",
    "stars allotted a negative amount of accreted mass by this process are assumed to have no added material .",
    "we assume the accreted mass is mixed over a surface layer of mass @xmath45 , as described in section [ section_mixing ] . our model for the mass of the surface mixing layer",
    "has many parameters , but we hold them fixed at the values given in that section .",
    "the single adjustable parameter is then the mean mass of accreted iron .",
    "we adjusted this mean to obtain a minimal @xmath96 in the binned data , both metallicity - mass and metallicity - age .",
    "the resulting fit to the metallicity - mass data is shown as the solid line in figure ( [ fig_mass_bin ] ) .",
    "we were able to find fits with reduced @xmath96 equal to one .",
    "the reduction in the @xmath96 of the fit afforded by the more sophisticated pollution model is dramatic .",
    "the detailed variation of @xmath25}$ ] with stellar mass , including the steep increase starting at @xmath67 , the dip around @xmath28 , and the steep increase to @xmath39 seen in the binned data is reasonably similar to that seen in the model .",
    "we feel that the low @xmath96 and the detailed variations of metallicity with mass offer strong support both for 1 ) a mass dependent mixing , as suggested by the li dip ; and 2 ) for accretion of @xmath97 of iron in most stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the metallicity - mass trend , combined with the jump in average [ fe / h ] around @xmath43 solar masses strongly suggests that stars in our sample have accreted iron rich material .",
    "however , the properties of our sample are not well constrained , since the selection criteria of the various samples collated by cayrel de strobel are difficult to ascertain .",
    "perhaps the apparent variations in average metallicity are due to some unknown selection effect .",
    "for example , one of the subsamples is that of favata , micela , & sciortino ( 1997 ) . a plot of [ fe / h ] versus mass for this sample shows an increase toward large masses , starting at about @xmath98 .",
    "however , this sample was selected to have @xmath99 ; this eliminates low metallicity high mass stars , which are bluer than this limit .",
    "this is the origin of the increase in [ fe / h ] at @xmath98 in this subsample .",
    "we do not see an increase in [ fe / h ] at @xmath98 in the large sample . however , perhaps the sharp jump we see at @xmath39 is due to a similar selection effect . the best way to eliminate",
    "this possibility would be to perform an unbiased survey of a large number of stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we encourage observers to undertake such a survey .",
    "we do have available to us a small control sample .",
    "stars that are slightly evolved , in the sense that their convection zones are 10 or more times larger than those on the main sequence , but which are not yet giants ( having @xmath69 within @xmath100 of the main sequence value ) provide a check on our interpretation .",
    "these stars sit in the hertzsprung gap . unlike giants ,",
    "their surface gravities and fluxes are very similar to stars on the main sequence , so their metallicities can be compared directly to those of main sequence stars .",
    "if pollution is responsible for the [ fe / h ] variations over and above those due to age effects , than hertzsprung - gap stars should have lower average metallicities , and they should show no trends with stellar mass .",
    "the open triangles in figure  ( [ fig_mass ] ) represent the metallicities of stars in the gap .",
    "it is apparent that these stars have , on average , slightly lower metallicity than unevolved stars of similar mass .",
    "this is confirmed by an examination of the binned data , figure  ( [ fig_mass_bin ] ) , which also shows that there is no evidence for a change in average [ fe / h ] in the gap stars at the blue edge of the lithium gap around 1.5 solar masses .",
    "this provides support for the notion that the variations in metallicity with mass seen in the unevolved stars is due to pollution .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "( [ fig_mass_bin ] ) shows the predicted @xmath25}$ ] for the same model as the solid line , but where the mass of the accreted material has been reduced by a factor of ten .",
    "this is equivalent to increasing the mass of the surface mixing layer by the same factor .",
    "the predicted metallicity for this population is lower than that predicted for the polluted sample , and shows only a hint of a `` lithium '' dip .",
    "it gives an acceptable fit to the rather sparse observational data ( reduced @xmath96 less than one ) .    in plotting both the data and the fit we have not adjusted @xmath25}$ ] according to the star s age . in figure  ( [ fig_age_fe_bin_adj ] )",
    "we replot the data adjusting for the age - metallicity trend using the measured slope of the age - metallicity relation in figure  ( [ fig_age_bin ] ) .",
    "this involves increasing the @xmath25}$ ] for old stars .",
    "this figure should be compared to plots of lithium abundance in clusters ; we see evidence of a `` lithium '' dip in the iron data similar to that seen in lithium data .",
    "the dip is less distinct in the iron data , a fact we attribute to the range of metallicities in our sample ( the metallicities in cluster stars show much smaller dispersions ) .",
    "the variation in metallicity produces a variation in the mass of the dip , so combining stars with different metallicity will tend to smear out the dip .",
    "this smearing is clearly seen in our monte carlo models ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig_mass_bin ] ) .",
    "we have also examine the metallicities of giants in our sample .",
    "they show a slight increase in [ fe / h ] with mass , but this increase is consistent with the age-[fe / h ] correlation .",
    "the average [ fe / h ] is actually slightly _ larger _ than either the unevolved stars or the hertzsprung gap stars , although consistent within the rather large errors .",
    "however , given the very different environment for line formation in these stars , we do not feel it is appropriate to make a direct comparison between the two populations .",
    "we made use of three free parameters in fitting the metallicity - age and metallicity - mass data ; one for the slope of the metallicity - age relation , one ( the mean of the added mass ) for the correlation in the metallicity - mass relation , and an overall normalization .",
    "we want to stress that , in fitting the hertzsprung gap star data , ( both age and metallicity ) we did not adjust any free parameters .",
    "we also had a number of parameters in the model which were fixed by other observations ; most were used to describe the location and depth of the lithium dip .",
    "the most critical for our purposes is the mass @xmath101 of the surface mixing layer in stars blueward of the dip .",
    "varying this mass will directly affect our estimates of the amount of iron accreted onto the star .",
    "for this reason our estimate of @xmath102 of accreted iron is uncertain .",
    "however , the need to accrete _ some _ material is not uncertain ; reducing @xmath53 will reduce the inferred mass of accreted material , but models with no pollution will still fail to fit the data .",
    "the linear model for the mass of the surface mixing layer we employ is unlikely to be correct in detail ; the `` v '' shaped bottom is particularly questionable .",
    "future work should employ a more realistic model for @xmath45 , but for this first foray we did not feel that more realistic models were necessary .",
    "if the trends we see are due to pollution , one might surmise that stars with larger [ fe / h ] will form with more massive planetesimal disks .",
    "this might result in larger amounts of iron rich material falling on stars with larger intrinsic metallicities .",
    "this could be modeled by assuming a correlation between [ fe / h ] and the amount of added material ; once again we leave such experiments for later work .",
    "the gas giant planets in our solar system appear to have rock / ice cores with masses of order @xmath103 , with the possible exception of jupiter @xcite , which could lack such a core .",
    "these cores are believed to form at @xmath104 au from the sun since the surface density of solid matter in the protoplanetary disk is believed to jump up beyond that distance due to the presence of ice .",
    "the discovery of jupiter - mass planets in small ( less than @xmath76 au ) orbits around solar type stars motivated a number of groups to suggest that gas giant planets migrate .",
    "if this migration is overly efficient , jupiter - mass objects may be accreted onto the star . in the leading theory of planetary migration , that of tidal interactions between massive planets and the gas disk out of which they formed , the migration time is given by the viscous evolution time of the disk , prompting many authors to predict such accretion @xcite .",
    "others have suggested accretion of iron rich material originally between the planet and the star @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct scenarios . in the first",
    ", iron rich material is pushed onto the star by the gaseous disk .",
    "this material necessarily falls on the star before the gas disk disappears , when the star is between one and ten million years of age . in the second",
    ", the enriched material arrives via some other mechanism , possibly long after the gas disk disappears .",
    "the primary difference between the two , from the point of view of pollution , is the depth of the stellar convection zone ; stars younger than ten million years and less massive than @xmath105 have very massive convection zones and consequently are difficult to pollute .",
    "however , as pointed out by laughlin and adams ( 1997 ) , stars more massive than @xmath106 will show evidence for pollution if they accrete iron rich material at ages @xmath107 myrs . figure  ( [ fig_laughlin ] ) shows a monte carlo model where @xmath108 of iron is added to stars before they reach ten million years of age .",
    "we have adjusted the age - metallicity slope and the fraction of stars accreting material to achieve the best @xmath96 fit ; we can find acceptable fits ( with @xmath109 ) to the unevolved stellar data as illustrated by the solid line in the figure .",
    "roughly @xmath110 of these massive stars must accrete jupiter - analogues as they approach the main sequence .",
    "this early accretion model does not do so well when compared to the evolved stars .",
    "the model predicts that the metallicities of the massive stars will lie below those of unevolved stars , as observed .",
    "however the model predicts that low mass stars will not show any reduction in @xmath84}\\right>$ ] , nor is the drop predicted for the massive stars as large as that seen in our data .",
    "using our best fit model ( the solid line in figure  [ fig_laughlin ] ) and then increasing the mass of the surface mixing layer by a factor of ten gives the dashed line in the figure ; for this model the reduced @xmath111 ; the predicted metallicities are systematically higher than those observed .",
    "there is also a theoretical difficulty with the early accretion model .",
    "the model is motivated by the possibility that gas in the protoplanetary accretion disk can push jupiter - mass objects into the star .",
    "the difficulty is that the gas that does this is also likely to accrete onto the star . since any excess iron sequestered in the doomed planet had to come from the gas in the disk , the gas in the disk must be iron poor .",
    "if this iron poor gas accretes at roughly the same time as the planet , the net change in the surface metallicity of the star will be zero .",
    "the fact that the net change in metallicity of the star should be small , combined with the poor fit of the model to the evolved star data , suggest that accretion must occur after the accretion disk vanishes .",
    "lin ( 1997 ) speculates that jupiter - mass planets might survive the gas disk only to fall onto the star later . if this occurs , and if these objects have heavy element abundances similar to gas giants in our solar system , then the star will gain @xmath112 of iron for each accreted object .",
    "we can find acceptable fits to the data in fig .",
    "( [ fig_mass_bin ] ) if roughly @xmath113 of stars in the solar neighborhood have each accreted a single jupiter - mass bodie _ after _ their convective envelopes thinned .",
    "these models naturally predict that the average metallicity of such stars will decrease by the observed amount when their convection zones deepen at the end of their main sequence lifetime .",
    "however we have more information available to us than just the mean metallicity as a function of stellar mass .",
    "in particular , we know that the distribution of [ fe / h ] is well fit by a gaussion , as illustrated in figure ( [ fig_histogram ] ) .",
    "this fact allows us to rule out pollution dominated by late ingestion of jupiter - mass planets having iron contents similar to that of the giant planets in our solar system .",
    "the idea is to use the sensitivity of the high mass stars to pollution .",
    "adding @xmath112 of iron in discrete lumps to @xmath113 of the stars ( to give the observed mean [ fe / h ] ) will produce a population with metallicities about three times that of the unpolluted population in these high mass stars . using the monte carlo model that reproduces the variation of mean metallicity mentioned in the previous paragraph",
    ", we obtain the two - peaked histogram shown in figure ( [ fig_histogram_1.4 ] ) .",
    "this can be compared with the observed distribution for those stars above @xmath28 shown on the same figure . if these stars are in fact polluted , the pollution is distributed smoothly over most of the stars rather than being concentrated in a fraction of order @xmath113 .",
    "we conclude that the metallicity trend we find is not produced by the late ingestion of jupiter - mass objects .",
    "the solar wind is observed to be iron rich ; in fact many elements with low first - ionization potentials are more abundant , while he , with its very high first - ionization potential , is under abundant @xcite .",
    "if a substantial portion of the stellar convection zone were lost in a massive wind then the photospheric iron abundance would be less than the bulk abundance .",
    "if less massive stars suffer larger mass losses ( relative to their more massive convection zones ) this would produce a population in which less massive stars have lower metallicity than more massive stars , as we have found .",
    "when these low mass stars evolve , deep convection zones will form and mix metal rich material up to the surface ; the high mass stars will also show a slight increase in iron abundance .",
    "however , what we appear to see is that as massive stars evolve , their metallicities decrease ; we do nt know what the low mass stars do when they evolve .",
    "there is a second difficulty with this scenario .",
    "the mass loss rates required of low mass stars are excessive ; to lose a substantial fraction of the convection zone ( @xmath114 for a @xmath67 star ) the wind must carry away @xmath115 for a billion years .",
    "the solar mass loss rate is @xmath116 .",
    "recent limits on the mass loss rates in k dwarfs are much lower , @xmath117 or less @xcite .",
    "of course the observation that lithium and beryllium depletions are correlated indicate that mass loss does not extend down to masses of order @xmath118 in stars of mass @xmath119 . taken together , these facts suggest that mass loss is not responsible for the metallicity variations we find .",
    "many young stars of roughly solar or larger mass show infrared excesses due to circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "much of this dust may end up on the star .",
    "dust particles which absorb photons moving radially and then radiate them isotropically ( in the dust rest frame ) lose angular momentum in a process called the poynting - robertson effect .",
    "the amount of angular momentum lost ( @xmath120 ) per photon of frequency @xmath121 is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the rest mass of the dust particle .",
    "thus , for each accreted dust particle , a star must emit @xmath124 photons , which means it must emit a total energy approximately equivalent to the rest mass energy of the accreted material .",
    "the total energy emitted during the period of dust accretion is larger than this by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the optical depth to dust absorption .",
    "thus , for a star radiating at approximately solar luminosity , the accretion of material will take a time @xmath127 for @xmath128 , this number corresponds roughly to the observed lifetime of dust around young massive ( f ) stars @xcite , but the spherically averaged @xmath126 is obviously considerably less than 1 ; values near @xmath129 are typical .",
    "decin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find longer lived disks ( @xmath130 gyr ) of similar optical depth , but the maximum amount of dust that such stars can accrete is still much less than an earth mass . we conclude that dust accretion is unlikely to provide enough material to explain the apparent iron enhancements we see .",
    "observations of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the sun indicate that it has roughly solar abundances ( @xmath131 dex ) of some elements , such as zn , p , and s @xcite .",
    "iron is typically depleted , probably onto dust grains .",
    "the youngest stars in our sample have @xmath25}\\approx 0.2 $ ] ( figure [ fig_age ] ) , slightly larger than the ism , but our results indicate that about @xmath132 of this is due to pollution .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that the bulk metallicity of young stars will equal that of the ism out of which they form .",
    "the implication is that older stars have metallicities lower than that of the ism in which they currently reside .",
    "accretion of the relatively metal rich ism material could in principle produce metallicity signatures of the type we have found .",
    "however , it seems that the youngest stars in our sample may be metal rich compared to the present day ism . in view of the rather large errors in the metallicity determinations",
    "we feel that this conclusion has to be considered as tentative .",
    "the star @xmath133 pictoris is surrounded by a dusty disk @xcite .",
    "the dust is believed to have a life time shorter than the estimated age of the star ( between @xmath134 and @xmath21 years ) and so must be replenished , possibly by collisions between planetesimals @xcite .",
    "transient red - shifted absorption features have been seen in spectra of @xmath133 pic for the last decade @xcite .",
    "these events have been interpreted as infalling comets or asteroids .",
    "events with very high velocities ( @xmath135km / s ) are seen a few times per month @xcite .",
    "similar transients are seen around numerous other young stars @xcite .",
    "the absorption features are believed to be produced by the cometary tails of the infalling bodies ; beust & morbidelli argue that the infalling bodies must have radii larger than @xmath107 km in order to survive the evaporation long enough to evolve onto the inferred highly eccentric orbits .",
    "they estimate that @xmath136 of material is removed from the planetesimal disk by this process if it has continued for @xmath21 years .",
    "they refer to evaporation of these bodies ; however a small but substantial fraction of them will survive long enough to strike the star .",
    "this could provide enough material to give the signature we have seen .",
    "the sun is metal rich for stars of its age and mass , as can be seen from figs .",
    "( [ fig_age ] ) and ( [ fig_mass ] ) .",
    "the implication is that the radiative interior of the sun might have a metallicity slightly lower than the photosphere .",
    "a number of authors @xcite suggested this possibility two decades ago as a way out of the solar neutrino problem ; lowering the metallicity of the solar interior reduces the radiative gradient , which in turn would lower the inferred temperature in the core .",
    "finally , a lower core temperature would predict that fewer neutrinos would be emitted compared to the standard solar model .",
    "the metallicity deficit required to explain the lack of solar neutrinos is much larger than the @xmath137 dex increase resulting from the accretion of @xmath2 of iron .",
    "this avenue for solving the neutrino problem was dropped by solar workers , partly for this reason .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined polluted models to see if accurate measurements of the the solar five minute oscillations ( p - modes ) could be used to detect differences between the metallicities of the surface convection zone and the radiative interior .",
    "they found that current data was unable to distinguish between unpolluted models and models with @xmath138 of accreted cometary material .",
    "the effect on the production of solar neutrinos was also negligible .",
    "as an aside we note that the soho satellite has discovered a large number of sun grazing stars , a class of comets that plunge into the sun ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "roughly 200 have been observed by soho over its lifetime to date .",
    "raymond et al . give an estimate of about @xmath139 cm for the radius of the comet they observed . if most of the observed objects are of this size , and if we assume that the currently observed rate has been more or less steady over the lifetime of the sun , ( one strikes the sun roughly every day as observed in 2000 ) , then the mass of accreted material would be about one - one millionth of an earth mass .",
    "note however that most of the comets seen by soho appear on dynamical grounds to be the result of the break - up of a single object , so that the currently observed flux is likely to be a burst of transient activity .",
    "we analyzed some 642 stars from the cayrel de strobel catalogue having spectroscopically determined metallicities , and well determined hipparcos parallaxes . using a large grid of stellar models",
    ", we determined the age and mass of the stars in our sample .",
    "we then examined the variation of metallicity with stellar age and mass .",
    "we have found striking mass - dependent variations in photospheric iron abundances of main sequence solar mass ( @xmath140 ) stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these variations mimic the variations seen in lithium abundances . with somewhat less confidence , because of the small sample size , we find that the iron abundances of hertzsprung - gap stars are on average lower than those of main sequence stars , and that the metallicities of these slightly evolved stars have no mass dependence",
