    "there are many reasons for the recent surge of interest in supersymmetric ( susy ) so(10 ) models such as ( i ) a possibility to understand the observed patterns of fermion masses and mixings@xcite ; ( ii ) small non - zero neutrino masses@xcite ; ( iii ) a simple mechanisms for baryogenesis@xcite , etc .",
    "the recent observation@xcite that level two compactification of superstring models can also lead to so(10 ) models with higher dimensional multiplets such as * 45 * and * 54 * that can help in grand unified theory ( gut ) symmetry breaking has injected new enthusiasm to this field .    in all so(10 ) models considered to date , one assumes a grand desert scenario between the tev scale ( corresponding to the electroweak symmetry as well as susy breaking ) and the gut scale , m@xmath9 , of order 10@xmath10 gev .",
    "this scenario is of course required if the known low energy gauge couplings are to unify at m@xmath9 given the particle spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite    there are however reasons to entertain the possibility that a gut model such as so(10 ) should have an intermediate scale around 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 gev corresponding to b - l symmetry breaking .",
    "the first one has to do with solving the strong cp problem via the peccei - quinn mechanism@xcite .",
    "since cosmological constraints require the pq - symmetry breaking scale , @xmath11 , around 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 gev , it will fit naturally into an so(10 ) model if a gauge subgroup of so(10 ) such as su(2)@xmath12 u(1)@xmath13 breaks around the same intermediate scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 .",
    "another reason that such model may be of interest has to do with the possibility that the tau neutrino with a mass of few electron volts may constitute the hot dark matter ( hdm ) component of the universe needed to fit the observations on the large scale structure with the successful big bang picture@xcite . in the see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses predicted by a class of @xmath15 models , this requires that there must be an intermediate scale corresponding to the @xmath16 symmetry breaking around @xmath17 gev , which is of the same order as required for the invisible axion scenario .",
    "the fact that such an so(10 ) scenario emerges naturally in non - supersymmetric context has been known for some time@xcite .",
    "as far as the neutrino mass alone is concerned , one could argue that an ev range mass for the tau neutrino could be obtained in the grand desert type @xmath15 models by judicious `` dialing '' down of the yukawa coupling of the @xmath18 coupling to the matter spinors .",
    "this would of course not accomodate the invisible axion solution to the strong cp - problem .",
    "moreover , in two interesting recent papers@xcite , it has been noted that at least for the small @xmath19 case , this alternative may run into trouble with the hypothesis of bottom - tau mass unification@xcite , which is another successful prediction of grand unified theories . of course one could abandon the @xmath4 unification hypothesis as in @xmath15 models which contain@xmath20 multiplets ( e.g. see ref.@xcite ) or one could consider a large @xmath19 scenario .",
    "but if we insist on a small @xmath19 , then an alternative that is available is to abandon the grand desert scenario and consider intermediate scale type @xmath15 models and see if it is consistent with the @xmath4 unification hypothesis . in this paper , we explore this possibility .",
    "we first seek simple extensions of the minimal susy so(10 ) model which can support intermediate scales corresponding to b - l symmetry breaking consistent with the gauge coupling unification .",
    "we will assume that supersymmetry is an exact symmetry above the weak scale , as is generally believed .",
    "several such models have already been discussed in the literature@xcite . in our work",
    ", we will assume that the particle spectrum below the planck scale is of the type dictated by recent level two kac- moody schemes@xcite , so that they contain three * 16 * dim .",
    "spinors corresponding to three generations of matter fields , a number of * 10 * , @xmath21 , * 45 * and * 54 * dimensional fields .",
    "this is one of the respects in which our work differs from earlier works in ref.@xcite . for this case , by appropriate adjustments of the particle spectrum , we have found several new classes of intermediate scale models .",
    "if we choose a value of the qcd coupling @xmath22 , only one class of these models is singled out as preferable to the others in the one loop approximation .",
    "since the two loop corrections to these results are not that drastic , we choose to do a more detailed analysis with this model .",
    "we then impose the additional requirement that the yukawa couplings corresponding to the bottom quark and the tau lepton unify at m@xmath9 and use the prediction for the bottom quark mass as an indicator of the viability of a given scenario .",
    "we are able to find one scenario which has @xmath6 gev as desired , with a prediction for @xmath7 gev in the one loop approximation , which we believe is phenomenologically acceptable@xcite .",
    "this is the main result of our paper .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows : in sec .  2 ,",
    "we discuss examples of susy so(10 ) models , where intermediate b - l symmetry breaking scales can arise , consistent with gauge coupling unification ; in sec .  3 , we discuss the restrictions of b-@xmath8 yukawa unification in these models ; in sec .  4 ,",
    "we discuss how neutrino masses are understood in this class of model ; in sec .  5 , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "it is well - known that if one assumes exact supersymmetry above the tev scale and the particle spectrum of the mssm , there is no room for an intermediate scale consistent with gauge coupling unification . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist several examples@xcite where changing the spectrum can lead to a variety of possibilities for intermediate scales corresponding to su(2)@xmath12 u(1)@xmath13 symmetry breaking .",
    "our goal is to seek an intermediate scale around 10@xmath23 - 10@xmath2 , motivated by the allowed scale for the invisible axion solution to the strong cp problem and an hdm @xmath3 . in our analysis of gauge coupling unification",
    ", we will first use one - loop beta function to get a rough idea about the nature of intermediate scales .",
    "we will then pick out the scenario which has the best chance of fulfilling our requirements and do a two loop analysis for the gauge coupling evolution to find the more exact value of the intermediate scale . at the two - loop level",

    "note that both these solutions require the existence of the @xmath44 pair at the gut scale ; therefore they can not emerge from simple superstring models with either kac - moody level one or two @xcite .",
    "we therefore seek solutions that donot involve these multiplets .",
    "we have found six solutions using the method described in ref@xcite .",
    "one of them is the one already found by deshpande , keith and rizzo@xcite .",
    "they are all characterized two integers @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents the number of @xmath47 multiplets and @xmath48 represents the number of @xmath49+@xmath50 multiplet pairs above the scale @xmath39 .",

    ", the value of the intermediate scale @xmath39 depends mainly upon @xmath56 .",
    "we display this dependence in fig .",
    "1 using one - loop renormalization equations , where only the mean values of @xmath57 ( @xmath25=1,2 ) are used . from figure  1 , it is clear that only for the two models ( v ) and ( vi ) one can have intermediate scales around 10@xmath1 gev , in which we are interested . for those two models ,",

    "we have not included any other thershold corrections in our calculations .",
    "in this section , we will explore whether it is possible to achieve b-@xmath8 mass unification in the class of intermediate scale scenarios discussed in the previous section .",
    "let us first give a qualitative overview of the issues involved here .",
    "it is well - known that yukawa couplings for the bottom quark ( @xmath62 ) and the tau lepton ( @xmath63 ) evolve differently above the weak scale .",
    "there are two classes of diagrams that control their evolution : ( i ) one class involving the virtual gauge bosons and ( ii ) a second class involving virtual higgs bosons .",
    "we will keep their effects up to one - loop for all the quarks and display the equations in terms of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 :    @xmath66 ,   \\label{hts } \\\\ { d y_b \\over d t } & = & { y_b \\over 2 \\pi } \\left [ y_t+6 y_b+y_{\\tau } -\\sum_{i } c^{(b)}_i \\alpha_i \\right ] ,   \\label{hbs } \\\\ { d y_{\\tau } \\over d t } & = & { y_{\\tau } \\over 2\\pi } \\left [ 4 y_{\\tau } + 3 y_b -\\sum_{i } c^{(\\tau)}_i \\alpha_i \\right ] ,   \\label{hrs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 = 1 , 2 , 3 denote u(1)@xmath29 , su(2)@xmath30 , and su(3)@xmath67 respectively , and @xmath68 = ( 13/15 , 3 , 16/3 ) ; @xmath69 = ( 7/15 , 3 , 16/3 ) ; @xmath70= ( 9/5 , 3 , 0 ) .",
    "we also note that we have redefined the u(1)@xmath29 gauge coupling so that the new u(1)@xmath29-charges , @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the canonically assigned u(1)@xmath29-charge .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that if all yukawa couplings were small , then simple closed form solutions relating the yukawa couplings at different mass scales can be written down . in particular one can obtain @xmath74    the b-@xmath8 unification scenario implies @xmath75 . if we ignore the effects of the u(1)@xmath29-coupling , we can easily see that since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 as needed .",
    "numerically , evaluating the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ brz ] ) , one finds that @xmath79 exceeds the experimental value ( denoted by @xmath80 ) by about 30% . and",
    "@xmath81 to their values at @xmath60 , we have used the three - loop qcd and one - loop qed beta function effects@xcite . ] fortunately , experimental indications of a large top quark mass already implies that @xmath82 effects can not be ignored in the evolution of @xmath62 ; moreover , for large @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for mssm ) , effects of @xmath62 and @xmath87 can not be ignored either .",
    "this restores agreement between gut scale b-@xmath8 unification and known masses of the b and @xmath8 . in a sense ,",
    "given the free parameter @xmath83 , b-@xmath8 unification in a simple grand desert type gut model is not very constraining and an arbitrary choice of @xmath82 and @xmath19 helps in making @xmath4 unification an experimental success .",
    "in fact for the case of small @xmath19 , this can be seen explicitly from the following formula@xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 it is clear that by adjusting @xmath82 , the value of @xmath90 can be made bigger than one producing the desired suppression .",
    "suppose that we now go beyond the grand desert scenario and require , as we do here , that there is a gauge intermediate scale , @xmath39 corresponding to su(2)@xmath12 u(1)@xmath13 breaking .",
    "several new features emerge :    \\(i ) the nature of the yukawa couplings and their evolutions change due to the presence of new symmetries and new particles above @xmath39 .",
    "\\(ii ) the evolution of gauge couplings change due to the same reasons .",
    "\\(iii ) finally between @xmath39 and @xmath59 , @xmath4 mass unification implies that there is cancellation between @xmath82 and @xmath91 ( where @xmath91 is dirac type coupling of the neutrinos ) in the evolution equation for @xmath62 so that the correct experimental value is not guaranteed merely by the choice of @xmath82@xcite .    in this case",
    ", one can write : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 represent respectively the gauge contributions between @xmath60 and @xmath39 and between @xmath39 and @xmath59 and similarly the @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent the yukawa coupling contributions in the two ranges . the expression for @xmath95 is easily obtained from eq .  ( 10 ) by replacing the upper limit by @xmath97 ; in order to get the expression for @xmath96 , we need the evolution equations for the yukawa couplings above @xmath39 which are given below .    note that in contrast with the case discussed in@xcite , where there was no gauge intermediate scale , we have now a new possibilities to bring @xmath98 into agreement with data . the simplest way is to assume that above the intermediate scale @xmath39 , the qcd beta function coefficient @xmath99 becomes zero , so that @xmath100 becomes flat ; then @xmath94 is given purely by the @xmath101 evolution and one has roughly @xmath102 and the value of @xmath98 is determined by the value of @xmath103 which is always bigger than @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to @xmath105 which without any help from the top yukawa coupling can lead to agreement with @xmath80 .",
    "it is easy to see that this behaviour can occur if there is a color octet with mass at @xmath39 .",
    "it however turns out that in simple string inspired models , it is difficult to get such a light octet at @xmath39 .",
    "we will therefore have to be content with the situation where there are no color fields at @xmath39 ( see table i ) and see numerically what the prediction for @xmath106 is .",
    "another point that is important for our discussion is the embedding of the mssm higgs doublets into the gut multiplets . in the case of a single * 10 * so(10 ) model ( in the absence of any * 126*+@xmath107 multiplets ) both the mssm higgs multiplets are part of this * 10 * multiplet which leads to complete yukawa unification ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath108 at @xmath59)@xcite . while such models are quite elegant , a complete understanding of why @xmath83 is large in this case becomes difficult .",
    "we will therefore focus on the simple class of models where there are two * 10 * -higgses at the gut scale .",
    "in general , the higgs doublets @xmath109 , @xmath110 of mssm would be some linear combinations of the doublets in * 10 * s .",
    "but we will adopt a simple doublet - triplet splitting pattern such that for @xmath111 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 of mssm arise from different * 10 * s . that such a situation is possible has been shown in ref .",
    "this assumption though not crucial for our conclusions helps to simplify our calculations .    in the case where only one @xmath112(0,2,2,1 ) exists in the intermediate scale , the yukawa sector of the largrangian of the models",
    "is given by @xmath113 the equations used for yukawa couplings are @xmath114 ,   \\label{yq1 } \\\\ { d y_l \\over d t } & = & { y_l \\over 2 \\pi } \\left [ 3 y_q + 5 y_l -\\sum_{i } c^{(l)}_i \\alpha_i \\right ] ,   \\label{yl1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; @xmath25 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 denote u(1)@xmath13 , su(2)@xmath30 , su(2)@xmath28 , and su(3)@xmath67 respectively ; @xmath117 = ( 1/6,3,3,16/3 ) ; @xmath118 = ( 3/2,3,3,0 ) .    for reasons stated above , we will be interested in the case where two ( 0,2,2,1)-higgses appear at @xmath39",

    "these equations are supplemented by the one - loop evolution equations for the gauge couplings already described in the previous section contributions exist , see ref .",

    "this also fixes @xmath130 as well as @xmath59 .",
    "a given @xmath83 together with the experimental values for top quark and @xmath8 masses can determine the initial values for the yukawa couplings , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "then the yukawa and gauge coupling constants are numerically extrapolated , and the bottom quark mass is predicted .",
    "we have scanned a large region in the @xmath19-@xmath39 space for small @xmath19 so that the effects of @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be ignored in the yukawa coupling evolution equations .",

    "we realize that this value of @xmath138 may be somewhat on the high side but we wish to note that we have only used the one loop equations for the yukawa coupling evolution and in any case such a value is strictly not ruled out@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the yukawa couplings in this case are depicted in fig .",
    "in the previous sections , we established the existence of simple so(10 ) models with intermediate b - l symmetry breaking scales consistent with low energy data on gauge couplings with a reasonable prediction for @xmath139 .",
    "let us now discuss whether such models can indeed lead to a tau neutrino mass in the 5 to 7 electron volt range as required for it to be the hdm component of the universe .",
    "the reason such a discussion is called for is the following .",
    "a notable feature of the models we have discussed is the absence of * 126*+@xmath107 higgs multiplets , which are needed in the implementation of see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , the existence of a b - l breaking scale around 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 gev does not necessarily guarantee @xmath140 in the several ev mass range .",
    "we will show in this section , that it is possible to use a generalized see - saw mechanism@xcite such that even without the presence of * 126*+@xmath107 representations , one can get see - saw - like formula for light neutrino masses . to see our proposal in detail , let us denote the higgs - like * 16*+@xmath141 multiplets by @xmath142 , and matter spinors by @xmath143 .",
    "let us introduce 3 gauge singlet fields , @xmath144 .",
    "the part of the superpotential relevant for neutrino masses is    @xmath145    recall that @xmath146 is the * 10 * -dim .",
    "higgs multiplet which leads to the @xmath109-type higgs doublet of mssm and is therefore responsible for the dirac mass of the neutrinos .",
    "the resulting mass matrix involving @xmath147 , abd @xmath148 is given in the basis \\{@xmath149 , ( @xmath150=1,2,3 ) } by @xmath151    note that @xmath152 , and @xmath153 are 3 @xmath154 3 matrices .",
    "it is clear that if we ignored all generation mixings then @xmath152 , and @xmath153 will be diagonal and the mass of @xmath150-th light majorana neutrino will be given by @xmath155 if we assume that @xmath156 , then the familiar see - saw formula results and for @xmath157 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 gev , @xmath140 is in the ev range .",
    "let us be clear that unlike the simple 2 @xmath154 2 see - saw models , one can not make definite predictions for neutrino masses and mixings due to the presence of arbitrary singlet mass @xmath158 .",
    "also note that the value of @xmath159 should not be too much smaller than one since in our discussion in sec .  2 and sec .  3",
    ", we have assumed that the right - handed neutrino contributes to renormalization group equations for @xmath160 .",
    "looking at the formula eq .",
    "( [ va ] ) , one might think that regardless of the value of @xmath161 , one might get an ev range mass for @xmath3 by simply adjusting @xmath162 .",
    "this is however not true ; if @xmath163 , the mass of the heavy right - handed neutrino ( say @xmath164 ) becomes @xmath165 , which is much less than @xmath166 . in this case",

    "thus , our discussion of b-@xmath8 unification essentially restricts @xmath167 ; as a result , one recovers the usual @xmath168 see - saw formula for @xmath3 mass and a few ev @xmath3 goes with a @xmath169 gev .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the possibility that supersymmetric so(10 ) models have an intermediate scale around @xmath170 or @xmath171 gev so that they can naturally accomodate the invisible axion mechanism to solve the strong cp problem and also provide room for the tau neutrino to have a mass in the range of @xmath172 to @xmath173 ev so that it can constitute the hdm component of the universe .",
    "we have tried to stay within the constraint of a superstring inspired particle spectrum .",

    "<S> considerations of massive neutrinos , baryogenesis as well as fermion mass textures in the grand unified theory framework provide strong motivations for supersymmetric(susy ) so(10 ) as the theory beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> if one wants to simultaneously solve the strong cp problem via the peccei - quinn mechanism , the most natural way to implement it within the framework of the susy so(10 ) model is to have an intermediate scale ( @xmath0 ) ( corresponding to b - l symmetry breaking ) around the invisible axion scale of about 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> such a scale is also desirable if @xmath3 is to constitute the hot dark matter ( hdm ) of the universe . in this paper , we discuss examples of superstring inspired susy so(10 ) models with intermediate scales that are consistent with the low energy precision measurements of the standard model gauge couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of @xmath4 unification which is a successful prediction of many grand unified theories is then required of these models and the resulting prediction of @xmath5-quark mass is used as a measure of viability of these schemes . detailed analysis of a model with a @xmath6 gev , which satisfies both the requirements of invisible axion and @xmath3 as hdm is presented and shown to lead to @xmath7 gev in the one - loop approximation .    </S>",
