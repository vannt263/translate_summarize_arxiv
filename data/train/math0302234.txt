    "the purpose of this article is to establish the existence and continuity of the caldern projectors for families of perturbed signature operators on a 3-manifold with boundary .",
    "we explain briefly the motivation .    the morse theory of the chern - simons function on the space of @xmath0 connections over a 3-manifold leads to the construction of topological invariants , notably taubes construction of casson s invariant @xcite , floer s instanton homology @xcite , and more recently @xmath1 and @xmath0 extensions of casson s invariant @xcite .",
    "these invariants are defined using the morse index of the hessian of the chern - simons function at a critical point . to make this rigorous taubes showed ( in the @xmath2 setting ) how to understand this ill - defined morse index in terms of the spectral flow of the odd signature operator coupled to a path of connections .",
    "most importantly for the present article , he also showed how to construct perturbations of the chern - simons function in order to make it suitably non - degenerate .",
    "taubes ideas form the blueprint for generalizations of casson s invariant .",
    "in particular the definition of the generalized casson invariants involve the spectral flow of 1-parameter families of perturbed odd signature operators",
    ". these perturbed odd signature operators ( which we describe in detail below ) are compact perturbations of dirac operators , but they are not differential operators .    with the construction of a morse - theoretic topological invariant established , the problem arises of computing the invariant to discover what information it contains .",
    "casson s surgery formula and floer s exact triangle are examples of computational formulas which make it possible to compute their invariants . in general",
    "one wishes to have surgery formulas for the generalized casson invariants .",
    "this leads to the problem of computing the spectral flow of the hessian of the chern - simons function between critical points in terms of cut  and  paste data for the underlying 3-manifold .",
    "there is a good cut  and ",
    "paste theory for the spectral flow of dirac operators which make it possible to carry out calculations .",
    "nicolaescu s article @xcite gives a splitting formula for the spectral flow of a family of dirac operators .",
    "this formula equates the spectral flow to an infinite  dimensional maslov index corresponding to the associated paths of caldern projectors coming from two parts in a decomposition of the manifold .",
    "( roughly speaking , the caldern projector   for a dirac operator @xmath3 is the projection in @xmath4 onto the subspace of boundary values of solutions to the equation @xmath5 . )",
    "nicolaescu s result , combined with some techniques introduced in @xcite , sufficed to compute @xmath1 casson invariants for certain seifert fibered homology 3-spheres in @xcite , where one could avoid using perturbations ( at least near the reducible critical points ) .",
    "however , the presence of singularities in the flat moduli space complicates calculations for more general homology spheres , requiring the use of perturbations .",
    "to apply the powerful methods of @xcite one needs an extension of the results concerning the existence and continuity of the caldern projectors for families of operators more general than dirac operators ; in fact general enough to include the perturbed odd signature operator .",
    "this is the task accomplished in this article .",
    "our main result is the following , which combines theorems [ continuitycald ] and [ poissonop - a ] .    * theorem .",
    "*    _ consider the class @xmath6 of dirac operators on @xmath7 for a manifold with boundary @xmath8 which are in cylindrical form near @xmath9 , and the class @xmath10 of auxiliary operators satisfying the pseudolocality property ( [ pseudolocality ] ) .",
    "then for @xmath11 and @xmath12 the caldern projector of @xmath13 is well defined . _    we say that a family @xmath14 varies continuously if all coefficients of @xmath15 ( in any local chart ) vary continuously . moreover , we equip @xmath10 with the usual norm topology of @xmath16",
    ". then for each @xmath17 the map @xmath18 taking a pair @xmath19 to the caldern projector @xmath20 for the operator @xmath13 is continuous .    in the statement",
    ", @xmath21 is a vector space isomorphic to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the space of sections @xmath24 which vanish on a collar of the boundary and which satisfy @xmath25 . for dirac operators",
    "the unique continuation property implies that @xmath26 .",
    "a novel feature of our approach is that we do not require the unique continuation property to hold .",
    "we are chiefly concerned with the application of this result to the perturbed odd signature operator arising from the morse theory of the chern - simons function , as this will be used crucially in a forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "( in fact the completion of that article was held up by the need for the main result of the present article . )",
    "unfortunately there is no suitably precise exposition of the various constructions which arise in this context and so we include the details necessary to set up the problem precisely and also for the convenience of the reader .",
    "one of our purposes is to explicitly provide justification for comments like `` in the non - generic case one must perturb , but the arguments carry through , '' in the context of cut  and  paste techniques for spectral flow .",
    "it is our hope that in addition to providing the proof of the theorem stated above this article complements the exposition @xcite .",
    "thus in section [ set - up ] we explain the approach used in the morse - theoretic study of the chern - simons function , with an emphasis on how the perturbations are constructed and on the effect of perturbing on the hessian of the chern - simons function .",
    "we also include proofs of some ( known ) results concerning the pseudolocality of the perturbation ( proposition [ lem2.1 ] ) and an estimate concerning the size of the perturbation ( lemma [ estimate ] ) that we require to apply the result stated above to the context of the hessian of the perturbed chern - simons function .",
    "theorem [ thm5.3 ] is our desired application . in this statement",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the perturbed twisted odd signature operator coupled to a connection @xmath28 and a perturbation @xmath29 .",
    "it is essentially the hessian of the perturbed chern - simons function @xmath30 .",

    "let @xmath8 be a compact 3-manifold with boundary and @xmath31 the space of connections in a principal @xmath0 bundle over @xmath8 .",
    "then there exists a neighborhood @xmath32 of the space of flat connections , and an @xmath33 so that if @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35 ball around @xmath36 in the space of perturbations @xmath37 , the map @xmath38 sending a pair @xmath39 to the caldern projector @xmath40 of @xmath27 is continuous .",
    "_    we finish the article by giving a new proof in section [ application ] , using our methods , of the main step in taubes argument that his invariant equals casson s invariant .    * theorem * ( taubes)*. * _ the mod 2 spectral flow of the perturbed odd signature operator between two generic perturbed flat connections on a homology 3-sphere equals zero if and only if the corresponding local intersection numbers of the @xmath2 character varieties of the heegard handlebodies in the @xmath2 character variety of the heegard surface are equal .",
    "_    the strategy of our proof is to use an adiabatic stretching of a collar of the heegard surface and symplectic reduction to reduce the infinite  dimensional maslov index ( which equals the sign taubes assigns to a critical point ) to a finite  dimensional maslov index in the character variety of a heegard surface ( which determines casson s sign ) . having established in theorem [ thm5.3 ] that the caldern projectors exist and vary nicely , the first step in the argument uses this and nicolaescu s theorem @xcite to identify spectral flow with the infinite  dimensional maslov index of the caldern projectors .",
    "the rest of the argument is a study of the effect of stretching and a corresponding symplectic reduction , as analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the authors thank h. boden , g. daskalopoulos , c. herald , t. mrowka , and k. wojciechowski for helpful discussions .",
    "we begin by recalling the spaces and operators of interest .",
    "let @xmath8 be a compact 3-manifold . fix a principal @xmath0 bundle @xmath41 over @xmath8 .",
    "we associate two vector bundles to @xmath41 : the @xmath42 vector bundle @xmath7 associated to the standard representation @xmath43 , and the lie algebra bundle @xmath44 associated to the adjoint representation @xmath45 of @xmath0 on its lie algebra @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the bundle @xmath41 is trivializable since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are trivial .",
    "we let @xmath31 denote the space of smooth connections on @xmath41 .",
    "a connection @xmath49 defines a covariant derivative @xmath50 it is convenient to view @xmath51 as a subbundle of @xmath52 .",
    "then the covariant derivative on @xmath51 associated to @xmath28 ( which we also denote by @xmath53 ) satisfies @xmath54 the covariant derivatives extend to @xmath55-forms @xmath56 and @xmath57 by requiring the graded leibnitz rule to hold .",
    "the operator @xmath58 has order zero and is given by multiplication by the curvature form @xmath59 .",
    "the space @xmath31 is an affine space modeled on the space of lie algebra valued 1-forms @xmath60 : fixing a connection @xmath61 yields an identification @xmath62 it is sometimes convenient to fix a trivialization @xmath63 ; then we can take @xmath61 to be the trivial ( product ) connection which we denote by @xmath64 .",
    "the space @xmath31 is acted on by the group of ( smooth ) gauge transformations @xmath65 in the usual way : @xmath66 .",
    "we fix a riemannian metric on @xmath8 .",
    "if the boundary of @xmath8 is non - empty we will always assume that a collar of the boundary @xmath67 in @xmath8 is isometric to @xmath68 .    the @xmath69 inner product on @xmath70 is then defined in terms of the hodge @xmath71 operator on @xmath8 by the formula @xmath72    for analytical reasons one must at times complete the spaces @xmath31 and @xmath73 in appropriate sobolev norms .",
    "thus we fix some @xmath74 and take @xmath75 to be the @xmath76 completion of @xmath77 , and @xmath78 to be the closure of @xmath73 in the @xmath79 completion of @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath76 denotes the completion in the sobolev norm corresponding to sections with @xmath81 derivatives in @xmath69 , extended in the standard way to all @xmath82",
    ". then @xmath78 acts smoothly on @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the restriction @xmath74 guarantees that the gauge transformations are continuous .",
    "the chern - simons function @xmath84 is defined in terms of a trivialization @xmath63 as follows .",
    "to a connection @xmath49 one can assign the @xmath46-valued 1-form @xmath85 one then defines @xmath86 in this expression ( as in equation ( [ eq2.2 ] ) ) the wedge product means the wedging of the differential forms and matrix multiplication of the @xmath46 coefficients .",
    "note that the definition ( and value ) of the chern - simons function depends on the choice of trivialization of @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath8 is _ closed _ , then the reduction of @xmath87 modulo @xmath88 is independent of the choice of trivialization , and is gauge invariant .",
    "in fact , @xmath89 , where the degree is defined using the fact that @xmath90 .",
    "thus when @xmath8 is closed , one considers the chern - simons function as a circle valued function on the quotient @xmath91 .    in @xcite , taubes gave an interpretation of casson s invariant of homology 3-spheres by studying the morse theory of the chern - simons function .",
    "this was generalized in much subsequent work , including the work of floer @xcite and herald - boden @xcite .",
    "thus we look next at the differential topology of @xmath31 , @xmath73 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the tangent space of @xmath31 at a connection @xmath28 is canonically identified with @xmath60 .",

    "_ in this section we assume that @xmath8 is a closed 3-manifold_. this is because the differential operators which arise from the morse theory of the chern - simons function have a simple description on a closed manifold which is adequate for our purposes , even though we are ultimately interested in cutting and pasting questions . this section could be written in the context of manifolds with boundary , but in that case the proper way to study the chern - simons function is as a section of a determinant bundle as in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "similarly the linearization @xmath112 of @xmath113 is obtained from the hessian by the rule @xmath114 . from the above formulas",

    "this motivates setting @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the @xmath69 orthogonal projection .",
    "the operator @xmath128 agrees with the restriction of @xmath117 to @xmath129 if the connection @xmath28 is flat .",

    "the spaces @xmath129 form a smooth vector bundle over each orbit - type stratum of @xmath98 . in particular , taubes idea was to use the spectral flow of a family of operators @xmath131 as a substitute for the difference in morse index of critical points @xmath61 and @xmath132 of the chern - simons function , and thereby to define an euler characteristic for @xmath98 .",
    "( the _ spectral flow _ @xmath133 of a 1-parameter family of self  adjoint operators @xmath134 is the integer defined to be the number of eigenvalues that cross zero , counted with sign .",

    "odd signature operator _",
    "( obtained essentially by folding up the sequence ( [ eq2.4 ] ) ) @xmath139 is a self  adjoint dirac operator in the sense of e.g. @xcite for any connection @xmath28 .",

    "flat , @xmath141 . for a general irreducible connection @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath142 is a relatively compact operator .",

    ", one sees that the spectrum of @xmath149 is the disjoint union of the spectrum of @xmath128 and a symmetric ( with respect to @xmath150 ) spectrum .",
    "a simple argument then shows that given a path @xmath151 of ( say irreducible ) connections joining two critical points of @xmath92 , the spectral flow of the family @xmath131 ( which plays the role of the difference in morse indices of @xmath92 at @xmath61 and @xmath132 ) equals the spectral flow of the family @xmath152 .",
    "what is gained is that the spectral flow of @xmath152 makes sense whether or not @xmath151 is a path of irreducible connections , i.e.  even when the subspaces @xmath153 do not vary continuously .",
    "we come now to the construction of perturbations and their effect on the hessian of the chern - simons function . the critical point set of @xmath92 may be complicated and it is often necessary to perturb the chern - simons function to make it as nice as possible .    making precise what ",
    "nice \" means can be quite difficult in the case of @xmath0 for @xmath154 , or when the homology of @xmath8 is complicated . in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath8",
    "a homology sphere taubes replaced @xmath92 by a function @xmath155 whose restriction to the top stratum of @xmath98 ( i.e. the irreducible connections ; see section [ application ] ) is morse in a suitable sense , and then used this to define a topological invariant in the spirit of the poincar - hopf theorem , which he showed equals casson s invariant . in @xcite a similar analysis is carried out for @xmath1 and @xmath8 a homology sphere leading to a definition of an @xmath1 casson invariant ; in that case in addition to being morse on the top stratum of @xmath98 , @xmath155 must be suitably non - degenerate in higher codimensional strata . in more recent work @xcite",
    "herald shows how with a suitable choice of perturbation @xmath156 one can define versions of casson s invariant for rational homology spheres and @xmath0 , @xmath157 .",
    "there are slightly different approaches to constructing a suitable family of perturbations @xmath156 , but they are similar and our method will apply to each approach .",
    "we mention that the basic requirements that @xmath156 should satisfy are :    1 .   the perturbation @xmath156 should be a smooth function on the hilbert manifold @xmath158 .",
    "2 .   the operator defined by the hessian of @xmath159 at @xmath28 should be a compact perturbation of @xmath128 .",
    "the family of admissible @xmath156 should be large enough so that one can prove various general position results about @xmath155 on the strata and their normal bundles of @xmath98 .",

    "the difference between them is that it is easier to show that the third condition above holds for perturbations of the type floer considers since the base point issues are easier to control .",
