    "many observed protostellar disks exhibit features broadly consistent with the presence of planets .",
    "in particular , transitional disks can have cavities or gaps in their disk structure , and it is suspected in these cases that this could be due to a planet or several planets which have cleared their orbits of dust and gas ( see a recent review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "spectral energy distributions of these disks can exhibit deficits , particularly around @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the warm dust in the inner part of these disks is somewhat depleted @xcite .",
    "cavities have also been observationally resolved , in both near infrared ( nir ) by direct imaging of polarized scattered light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at mm wavelengths by observing the dust continuum and/or molecular line emissions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "resolved observations at these two spectral windows probe the spatial distribution of different disk components , which is important because different disk components do not always have the same spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "nir images trace the disk surface structure in the small grains ( @xmath4 ) as disks are generally optically thick at nir , while optically thin mm continuum or molecular line emissions can be used to constrain the surface density of the gas and the big grains ( @xmath5 mm ) .",
    "it is very often non - trivial to `` translate '' observed image morphology at nir and visibility measurements at mm to underlying physical density structures of various disk components , and radiative transfer simulations are often needed to make the connection .",
    "ideally one would like to constrain the depletion factor of the gas @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the gas surface density ) , but nir scattered light and millimeter continuum emission only probe the distribution of dust grains .",
    "therefore @xmath8 is typically inferred in one of two ways : ( 1 ) optically thin molecular line emission data can be fit to disk models to directly pin down @xmath8 , or ( 2 ) the cavity depletion factor of the small grains @xmath9 can be measured , and the gas depletion can then be constrained based on the assumption @xmath10 , as small grains are generally considered to be well mixed with the gas due to their small stopping time .    both methods to infer @xmath8 are very challenging , because they necessitate both high resolution and high sensitivity to measure the cavity . only a few cavities in transitional disks have been modeled and measured in detail .",
    "for example , using rotational transitions of various co isotopes , @xcite found that observations are consistent with a model in which @xmath11 drops by a factor of @xmath1212 inside the @xmath1260 au gap in irs  48 , and by at least a factor of 110 inside 20  au .",
    "@xcite found that depleting gas by a factor of @xmath1250 inside the cavity in hd  142527 can fit their data .",
    "constraints on @xmath8 from these type of observations often depend on the assumptions made in the models , such as a certain undepleted / fiducial surface density profile and simplified disk model ( which is generally assumed to be axisymmetric and to have a very sharp cavity edge ) , and are also limited by the quality of current data .",
    "these constraints are generally only good to a factor of a few . by fitting both @xmath13  band images and",
    "the sed of pds  70 simultaneously , @xcite determined @xmath14 in the cavity of pds  70 , assuming a uniform depletion throughout the cavity .    the alma project will improve the accuracy and precision of these numbers considerably , and will substantially increase the number of transitional disks whose cavities are measured and modeled .",
    "we are therefore very close to observationally constraining the interaction between planets and their birth environments .",
    "for the few examples studied so far , cavities are found to be depleted of gas by at least an order of magnitude , but possibly more .",
    "this number ( the depletion factor ) should constrain the properties of the disks and the planets inhabiting these disks . in order to make this connection , one must study the physical problem of how empty gaps can become as a function of disk and planet parameters .",
    "several studies have attempted to use semi - analytic theory to describe gap profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculations have predicted highly depleted gaps ( depletion factors are roughly exponential with planet mass ) but numerical studies appear to be inconsistent with this result .",
    "recently , a few numerical studies have explicitly explored the question of how gap depth depends on planet and disk parameters .",
    "@xcite calculated gap opening for low - mass planets in the weakly nonlinear regime , and found that for a planet - to - stellar mass ratio @xmath15 in a disk with viscosity @xmath16 and aspect ratio @xmath17 , the gap depth scales as    @xmath18    so that gap depth exhibits power - law rather than exponential behavior ( though the scaling with @xmath17 was not actually measured in that study ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite explored the parameter space of giant planets , and found an empirical scaling relation for jupiter - like planets :    @xmath19    suggesting that @xcite captured a reasonably correct scaling with @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the weakly nonlinear regime , but the scaling with @xmath17 may be stronger .",
    "these studies suggest that deep cavities with depletion by a few orders of magnitude @xmath20 are reasonable to expect for gas giants in typical disks .",
    "however , all systematic quantitative numerical calculations of gap depths to date have focused on single - planet systems , though multiple - planet studies have begun to explore this question somewhat , see @xcite .",
    "gap opening in multiple - planet systems may be more complex , because the gap belonging to each planet is subject to periodic driving from neighboring planets , which may stir up the gas , having the overall effect of shallower gaps .",
    "such effects are also unlikely to be captured in current one - dimensional disk models , as the dynamics are complex and time - dependent .    in this letter ,",
    "we investigate gap opening in multiple - planet systems , studying the specific question of whether the presence of additional planets in the system has a strong impact on gap depths .",
    "we find that additional planets in the system indeed complicate the gap - opening process , resulting in much shallower cavities .",
    "this means that producing deep cavities with multiple - planet systems may require very large planets , and this may be a problem if such large planets are not directly imaged .",
    "this study performs a numerical integration of the two - dimensional isothermal fluid equations    @xmath21",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath7 is surface density , @xmath23 is velocity , @xmath24 is pressure , @xmath25 is the sound speed , @xmath26 is the viscous stress tensor , and @xmath27 is the gravitational potential of the central point mass and the perturbing planets . in this study ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be globally isothermal , so that the sound speed @xmath25 is a constant everywhere in the disk . for the current study ,",
    "the sound speed is chosen to give an aspect ratio of @xmath28 in the vicinity of the outermost planet .",
    "the numerical integration is carried out using the disco code , a moving - mesh hydrodynamics code tailored to the study of gaseous disks .",
    "a resolution of 512 radial zones is employed , logarithmically spaced between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the radial position of the outermost planet .",
    "this implies a resolution of @xmath32 zones per scale height in this planet s vicinity .",
    "@xcite argued that this resolution results in an effective numerical viscosity corresponding to @xmath33 , well below the chosen viscosity @xmath34 in this study .",
    "the initial disk profile is taken to be    @xmath35",
    "@xmath36    @xmath37    the viscosity in the disk is given an @xmath16 prescription ,    @xmath38    so that @xmath39 constant , and the background flow is a consistent inward accretion .",
    "the potential from the protostar and its satellites is given by    @xmath40    with smoothing length @xmath41 chosen in this study to be half of a scale height in the vicinity of each planet .",
    "each perturbing planet is given the same mass @xmath42 so as to simplify the range of parameter space studied .",
    "all planets are kept on fixed circular orbits , and the motion of the central protostar is neglected , though it is possible that this motion would also induce some gap stirring for large @xmath15 .",
    "the planets are placed in 2:1 resonance with one another , so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the planet - disk systems are run for thousands of orbits , until a steady - state is reached . for the multiple - planet cases , the  steady - state \"",
    "is really quasi - steady , as the solution is highly time - dependent , but a relaxed time - averaged state is found consisting of a consistent inward flow through the disk .",
    "figure [ fig:2d ] presents the most basic result of gap opening in multiple - planet systems . for @xmath45 planets , the two and three - planet systems have much shallower gaps than the single - planet system",
    "the fact that the planets can interact with one another s gaps is related to the fact that the gaps have merged with one another .    for small enough planet mass ( @xmath46 ) , each gap is confined to the planet carving it out .",
    "if the planet s mass is increased , the gap width grows until the two gaps merge .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : merge ] , which plots azimuthally averaged surface density in the two - planet system for several planet masses .",
    "the @xmath47 system opens two distinguishable gaps , while the @xmath48 system opens a single gap containing both planets .",
    "gap merging \" should happen roughly when the combined hill radii of the two planets are of order the separation between the planets :    @xmath49    where the hill radius @xmath50 .",
    "so , one should expect the gaps to merge when    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is some order - unity constant . in this study ,",
    "the empirical result @xmath53 is found , implying a critical mass ratio    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the mean of the two radii , @xmath56 .",
    "though this scaling with separation is largely speculative , as the variation of gap properties with planet separation was not explicitly explored in this study .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : qcrit ] ) also assumes both planets have the same mass . inserting the separation for a 2:1 resonance @xmath57 into this formula , this critical mass appears at the planet mass @xmath58 for the separation in the current study . on the other hand",
    ", this criterion also implies the planets are massive enough to gravitationally influence each other s gaps .",
    "therefore , as soon as the gaps are capable of merging , producing a large cavity , the planets are strong enough to stir up gas in each other s neighborhood .",
    "in short , a wide cavity can only be produced at the cost of keeping the cavity shallow .",
    "for very low viscosities or very thin disks , the gap might still be deep enough to represent a large depletion factor , but for the chosen disk parameters ( @xmath59 , @xmath28 ) the gap is only depleted by about a factor of ten at @xmath60 , which is shallower than depths inferred in some observations .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated in figure [ fig:2d ] , which shows single , double , and triple planet systems , for planets of mass @xmath61 .",
    "the single planet easily carves out a deep gap ( @xmath62 ) , but multiple - planet systems exhibit much shallower cavities ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] is an azimuthally averaged version of figure [ fig:2d ] ( in this average , gas within the planet s hill sphere is ignored , as this depends sensitively on how gas behaves very close to the planet , which is not well - captured in this numerical calculation ) .",
    "the cavity is of course wider when more planets are added , but clearly the cavity is also much more shallow , by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this may provide tension for observations of these cavities , if future observations can constrain gas depths to be as low as @xmath64 ( current direct observations of the gas density can not yet constrain the gap depth this precisely ) .",
    "deep cavities require much more massive planets than in the single - planet case .",
    "figure [ fig : gapdepth ] shows how this result depends on planet mass .",
    "depletion is calculated by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the value of the azimuthally averaged density at the outermost planet s orbital radius ( again , ignoring material within the planet s hill sphere ) , and @xmath67 is the surface density at @xmath68 , which is roughly where @xmath69 attains its maximum .    for values of @xmath15 below the critical threshold ( [ eqn : qcrit ] ) , the gap depths are reasonably consistent with the scalings ( [ eqn : duff ] ) or ( [ eqn : fung ] ) . at @xmath70 ( @xmath71 for the chosen parameter set ) ,",
    "the cavity stops depleting in the multiple - planet cases , and @xmath72 exhibits a plateau until about @xmath45 , after which @xmath73 .",
    "the value of the surface density in this plateau is probably the most important observable in this study .",
    "a reasonable estimate for the surface density in this case appears to be given by @xmath74 , where @xmath72 is given by either ( [ eqn : duff ] ) or ( [ eqn : fung ] ) . for very large - mass planets , @xmath75 , the plateau ends and a steep scaling of @xmath76 is found , though it should be stressed that this scaling is uncertain , as it is only based on a few data points .",
    "all of this can be summarized by the following approximate fitting formula :    @xmath77    where    @xmath78    assuming the disk parameters chosen in this study , @xmath59 , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath79 is given by equation ( [ eqn : qcrit ] ) .",
    "@xmath80 is the surface density scaling for low - mass planets ( @xmath81 ) and the transition at @xmath82 and the scaling @xmath83 at high @xmath15 is simply a fit to the high - mass data .",
    "it is unclear how the high - mass behavior should scale with disk parameters @xmath16 or @xmath17 ; this could be checked in a more complete study .",
    "deep gaps are challenging to produce with multiple - planet systems .",
    "very massive planets are necessary to explain density depletion factors of order @xmath84 , possibly @xmath85 jupiter masses or larger , compared with the @xmath86 necessary in the single - planet case .",
    "once the necessary planet mass enters the detectable planet regime in observations , it may be possible to either confirm or rule out planets as the agents responsible for some large cavities .",
    "the caveat to this is that low viscosities might result in deeper gaps , and low viscosity might be expected at large radii ( @xmath87 au ) due to the fact that the disk is not significantly ionized at large distances from the protostar , meaning that the magnetorotational instability may not generate a significant turbulent disk viscosity at these radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since the gap stirring is produced dynamically , the effective viscosity induced may be independent of the disk viscosity and therefore the same might be true of the gap depth .",
    "gap depths are also known to be highly sensitive to @xmath17 in single - planet systems , as seen by the steep dependence in equations ( [ eqn : duff ] ) and ( [ eqn : fung ] ) .",
    "a more complete parameter survey is warranted .",
    "a deep gap implies a very massive planet and therefore it is reasonable to ask whether resolution and sensitivity are high enough to detect such a massive planet .",
    "recently , several planet candidates have been found in transition disks , including t  cha @xcite , lkca  15 by @xcite , hd  100546 by @xcite , hd  142527 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , and hd  169142 by @xcite .",
    "the masses of the planet candidates can be as low as @xmath88 ( or even smaller , @xcite ) , although they are still very model dependent .    additionally , it may soon be possible to directly image the planet ; two survey scale direct imaging projects each with dedicated instruments are currently being carried out : the gemini planet imager exoplanet survey ( gpies ) @xcite , and the spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research ( shpere ) campaign with vlt @xcite .",
    "more results are expected in the next few years .",
    "the next generation of observations of transition disks may therefore be able to detect the planet which is producing the gap .",
    "if the planet is not detected , and if the gas in cavity can be constrained to a depth of @xmath89 or smaller , it should provide tension to the hypothesis that the cavity is produced by planets in the first place .",
