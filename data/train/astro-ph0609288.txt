    "frequencies lower than 6070  ghz , the most relevant contaminant is expected to be the galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "recent results based on 3-years wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data at 22.8-ghz show that even the high galactic latitudes are normally strongly contaminated @xcite .",
    "these authors use about 75  percent of the sky ( all high latitudes but strong large local structures like the northern galactic spur ) and find that at 6070  ghz the synchrotron emission competes with the cosmic @xmath0-mode signal even for models with @xmath260.5 , which are already disfavoured by the present upper limits .",

    "even though lower , this signal would largely contaminate the cmb @xmath0mode for most of the @xmath11 values presently allowed .",
    "however , these areas are not in the lowest emission regions visible in the 22.8-ghz wmap polarization map .",
    "information about the lowest emission regions are available , instead , from three independent small areas observed at 1.4 and 2.3-ghz @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission here actually looks weaker , competing with the cmb @xmath0-mode only for cosmological models with @xmath6@xmath7 at 70-ghz @xcite .",
    "such values would give more chances to investigate a large part of the inflationary model space , opening interesting perspective for the study of the inflation physics .",
    "however , the areas observed so far cover just few square degrees ( @xmath35-deg@xmath36 in total ) and represent few sparse samples of the lowest emission regions .",
    "a real knowledge of the typical galactic synchrotron contribution of such regions is still an open question , and requires wider areas to be analysed .",
    "this paper reports the first study carried out to identify and analyse the areas with the lowest synchrotron emission at microwave wavelengths , which allow negligible faraday rotation effects ( still appreciable at @xmath37-ghz ; e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "we use the 22.8-ghz polarization map of the 3-years wmap data release to select them ( section  [ wmapsec ] ) , and compute their polarized angular power spectra ( section  [ specsec ] ) .",

    "the signal appears even at high galactic latitudes and allows us to identify the lowest emission regions in the sky ( blue areas in top panel of figure  [ wmapfig ] ) , which , however , still have signal competing with the noise .",

    "we compute the @xmath41 and @xmath0mode power spectra of the polarized emission in the two selected areas .",
    "these are the quantities predicted by cosmological models and allow a direct comparison with the cmbp signal .    to account for the irregular sky coverage we use the method based on two - point correlation functions of the stokes parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 described by @xcite .",

    "if the flat component is compatible with noise , we performed montecarlo simulations .",
    "we have generated 100 noise map realizations assuming the sensitivity map provided in the wmap data package .",
    "then we compute their spectra using only the pixels of the two selected regions . for both the two cases , we find that the average spectrum is flat with normalization @xmath63  @xmath64k@xmath36 and @xmath65  @xmath64k@xmath36 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which are compatible with the level of our spectra at large @xmath66 ( figure  [ spec23fig ] ) .",
    "in addition , the spectra of the two @xmath39 cases converge to the same value in the flat range , which again suggests the spectra are noise dominated there .",

    "we tried to fit a power law @xmath67 to the spectra .",
    "only the case @xmath25 allows meaningful results ( table  [ fittab ] ) , because only few points ( three ) can be effectively used for @xmath24 , after the noise bias is subtracted for . to provide an estimate of the mean emission also for the @xmath24 case",

    "the result is reported in table  [ fittab ] , along with the same estimate for the @xmath2 area .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a factor @xmath70 in spectrum ( @xmath71 in signal ) between the mean emissions of the two analysed regions .",
    "moreover , the emission we found in the @xmath24 region is a factor @xmath72 weaker than that measured in the @xmath73% sky fraction in the same @xmath66-range @xcite .",

    "the contamination of the cmb @xmath0-mode signal can be estimated by extrapolating the spectra of sect .",
    "[ specsec ] to 70-ghz , a frequency in the range where the combined contribution of synchrotron and dust is believed to be minimum @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that typical values of rotation measure at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath7520  rad  m@xmath76 ) generate polarization angle rotations of 612  arcmin at 22.8-ghz .",
    "thus , faraday rotation effects can be considered negligible , allowing safe frequency extrapolations .",
    "our spectra are noise dominated at the multipole @xmath66 the cmb @xmath0-mode peaks at ( @xmath77 ) and a direct extrapolation of them would provide just upper limits .",
    "then , we adopt another approach : we use the spectra measured in the @xmath66range where they are signal  dominated and perform angular extrapolations to the scale of interest .",
    "the mean emission is that provided by the last column of table  [ fittab ] . as for the extrapolation",
    ", the analysis of the 1.4-ghz drao survey data shows that the angular behaviour of galactic synchrotron spectra is well represented by a power law @xmath78 with slope @xmath79 varying in the range [ -2.5 , -3.0 ] for @xmath80300 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath81 quoted by the wmap team for the whole 75% of the sky they consider @xcite .",
    "we use as slope both the two edge values of the @xmath79 range ( -2.5 and -3.0 ) and start extrapolations from the middle of the @xmath66-range used to evaluate the mean spectrum , namely @xmath82 ,  14 for @xmath24 ,  @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "frequency extrapolations are performed assuming the brightness temperature of the galactic synchrotron follows a power law @xmath84 , with @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "results are reported in figure  [ spec70fig ] .",
    "mode power spectra of the galactic synchrotron emission estimated at 70-ghz in the regions with @xmath24 ( green shaded area ) and @xmath25 ( gray shaded area ) .",
    "the two angular extrapolations with @xmath86 and @xmath87 are reported ( upper and lower dashed line of shaded areas ) .",
    "a slope @xmath88 is assumed for the frequency extrapolation .",
    "the case of a slope @xmath89 is also reported for the @xmath24 region ( yellow shaded ) . for comparison ,",
    "the plot shows cmb spectra for three different values of @xmath90 , the synchrotron emission detected in the two low emission areas in the target fields of the boomerang ( @xmath91 , @xcite ) and bar - sport experiments ( @xmath92 , @xcite ) , and the upper limit found in the dasi fields ( @xmath93 , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the general contamination at high galactic latitude , as estimated by the wmap team using 74.3% of the sky is also reported : the spectrum at 22.8-ghz is considered @xcite and extrapolated to 70-ghz .",
    "[ spec70fig ] ]    for the @xmath24 case , which concerns @xmath3% of the sky , the contamination range covered by the two angular extrapolations at @xmath94 competes with the cmbp @xmath0-mode for models with @xmath95 ,  @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "the comparison with previous measurements shows these values are significantly lower than the mean contamination estimated by the wmap team for most of high galactic latitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are similar to the contamination estimated in the small sky patches observed in low emission regions ( @xcite and references therein ) giving a valuable consistency of results in regions selected with similar criteria ( areas in lowest emission regions ) .",
    "although with the uncertainties of an angular scale extrapolation , our results extend to the whole lowest emission regions the promising indications obtained in those few small sample areas covering just few square degrees , and strongly support the possibilities to access small @xmath11 values in the lowest emission part of the sky .    the use of frequency slope @xmath85 can be considered as a conservative approach .",
    "in fact , @xcite fit the behaviour of the synchrotron total intensity , finding out a steepening of the slope at the highest frequencies of the wmap range .",
    "in particular , they fit @xmath89 in the range 2360  ghz .",
    "with such a slope the synchrotron contamination at 70  ghz further reduces by a factor 2.5 with respect to @xmath88 and even @xmath97 ,  @xmath98 $ ] becomes accessible ( yellow shaded area of figure  [ spec70fig ] ) .",
    "the situation is slightly worse for @xmath25 , as expected , since higher emission pixels are included in the analysis .",
    "however , @xmath99 ,  @xmath100 $ ] looks still accessible even in this larger region , assuming @xmath88 .",
    "these are values better than that for all the high galactic latitudes ( wmap results on @xmath101 of the sky ) , or in the areas analysed by @xcite .    for the lowest emission areas ,",
    "the minimum combined synchrotron - dust contamination has been found to be somewhere between 70 and 90-ghz @xcite .",
    "it is thus worthy estimating the synchrotron contamination of our best case ( @xmath24 ) even at 90-ghz .",
    "a further factor @xmath102 is gained with respect to 70-ghz ( in thermodynamic temperature ) , and the galactic signal competes with models with @xmath97 ,  @xmath98 $ ] .    despite the significant general contamination of high galactic latitudes ,",
    "the results obtained by our analysis depict a situation with better and interesting conditions in the lowest emission regions . the possibility to reach @xmath11 values as low as @xmath103@xmath7",
    "looks now extended from few small good sky patches to an area representing @xmath3% of the sky , that could be the right place for deep cmbp observations looking at the @xmath0-mode .    to limit observations in small regions , however , imposes intrinsic constraints on the minimum detectable @xmath11 , mainly because of the leakage from @xmath41- into the weaker @xmath0-mode .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that an all - sky survey would allow a detection of @xmath11 with a theoretical sensitivity limit of @xmath104 , that becomes @xmath105 when 70% of the sky is available , and @xmath106 for 15% ( 3-@xmath107 c.l . ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the class of inflationary models with minimal fine - tuning have @xmath11 values ranging within @xmath103 and @xmath108 @xcite , for which a 15% sky portion would be large enough for the first detection of the tensor cmbp component .    in spite of these limitation ,",
    "the minimum @xmath11 value detectable in 15% of the sky almost matches the limit imposed by the foregrounds we have found in lowest emission regions . although the uncertainties because of the angular extrapolations we need to apply , the search for the @xmath0-mode in a sky portion of such a size could thus be a good trade - off between intrinsic and foregrounds limits .",
    "in addition , the weakness of the @xmath0-mode signal makes already a challenge to detect the signal for @xmath109 with the present technology ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that significant technological improvements will be necessary before cosmologists can face an all - sky mapping mission with a sensitivity able to match the intrinsic limit of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , an experiment aiming at detecting the @xmath0-mode in a smaller region ( 10 - 15% of the sky ) can be a valuable intermediate step that would allow us to probe inflation models down to @xmath6 .",
