    "within the standard model of elementary particle physics , neutrinos play a special role in that they are the only fermions that appear with only two degrees of freedom per family , which are massless , and which interact only by the weak force apart from gravitation . if neutrinos had masses or anomalous electromagnetic interactions , or if right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos existed , this would be the long - sought `` physics beyond the standard model .

    "what remains are radiative decays like @xmath14 which are of higher order and thus too slow unless one postulates interactions beyond the standard model . moreover , the final - state photons would appear as contributions to the cosmic photon backgrounds , excluding a large range of neutrino masses and radiative lifetimes independently of theoretical predictions  @xcite . therefore , decaying - neutrino cosmologies as well as a circumvention of the cosmological mass bound require `` fast invisible decays , '' i.e.  fast decays with final - state neutrinos or with new particles such as majorons .",

    "all of this requires new physics beyond neutrino masses and mixings and thus shall not be pursued here any further .",
    "two mass limits deserve mention which were derived from the sn  1987a neutrino signal .",
    "first , the absence of a discernible time - of - flight dispersion of the observed @xmath5 burst gave rise to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "there remains some interest in this result because the laboratory limits from the tritium @xmath23 decay endpoint spectrum seem to be plagued with unidentified systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "second , if neutrinos had dirac masses , helicity - flipping collisions in the dense inner core of a sn would produce right - handed ( sterile ) states which are not trapped and thus carry away the energy directly rather than by diffusing to the neutrino sphere .",
    "this new energy - loss channel leads to a shortening of the expected sn  1987a @xmath5 burst .",
    "the observed burst duration thus leads to a bound @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "such a large mass violates the cosmological limit and is thus excluded anyway unless there are nonstandard decays .",
    "even `` invisible '' channels typically involve left - handed final - state neutrinos which are visible to the detectors which registered the sn  1987a signal .",
    "because the sterile neutrinos which escape directly from the sn core are more energetic than those emitted from the neutrino sphere , these events would stick out from the observed sn  1987a signal , leading to additional limits on some decay channels  @xcite .",
    "a future galactic sn would lead to much better mass limits .",
    "a detector like the proposed omnis  @xcite , which has evolved from the former snbo concept  @xcite , could measure neutrinos of all flavors by a coherently enhanced neutral - current nuclear dissociation reaction of the type .",
    "one could measure time - of - flight signal dispersion effects corresponding to neutrino masses of a few @xmath26 for @xmath27 or @xmath1 , especially in conjunction with the charged - current @xmath28 signal expected for superkamiokande  @xcite .",
    "this detector alone would be sensitive to on the basis of the rapid rise time of the expected neutrino burst .",
    "alas , galactic supernovae are rare ",
    "one expects at most a few per century .",
    "it would still be of utmost importance to run a supernova burst observatory for however long it takes to capture a galactic sn neutrino signal !",
    "massive neutrinos would seem to be natural candidates for the dark matter which dominates the dynamics of the universe  @xcite .",
    "however , they fare poorly in this regard for two main reasons .",
    "the first is a well - known problem with the phase space available to neutrinos in the dark - matter haloes of galaxies ( `` tremaine - gunn limit ''  @xcite ) .",
    "neutrinos bound to the galaxy naturally must move slower than the escape velocity @xmath29 so that their momentum is bounded by @xmath30 and their density by @xmath31 due to the pauli exclusion principle . the maximum local mass density in dark - matter neutrinos",
    "is then @xmath32 , leading to a _ lower _",
    "limit on the required mass for galactic dark - matter neutrinos of a few @xmath26 for normal spiral galaxies , and a few @xmath33 for dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , neutrinos can not be the dark matter on all scales where it is known to exist .",
    "the main argument against neutrino dark matter arises from our current understanding of how the observed structure forms in the cosmic matter distribution .",
    "one pictures a primordial distribution of low - amplitude density fluctuations which are later amplified by the action of gravity .",
    "the final distribution of galaxies depends on both the nature of the dark matter and the original fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this reasoning leads to pictures like fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] where the power spectrum of the matter distribution is shown as a function of wave - number or length scale .",
    "the data are derived from the observed galaxy distribution .",
    "=    rather general arguments as well as inflationary models of the early universe predict a roughly scale - invariant primordial fluctuation spectrum ( harrison - zeldovich - spectrum ) .",
    "one normalizes its amplitude to the cobe observations of the spectrum of cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] reveals that with this normalization a standard cold dark matter scenario predicts more power in the small - scale galaxy distribution than is observed .",
    "neutrinos , on the other hand , represent `` hot dark matter '' ( hdm ) because they stay relativistic until very late .",
    "this implies that their collisionless streaming erases the primordial fluctuation spectrum on small scales , suppressing the formation of small - scale structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] ) .",
    "one way out is that the original seeds for structure formation are not provided by initial density fluctuations but rather by something like cosmic strings or textures which can not be erased by free streaming  @xcite .",
    "such scenarios may or may not be excluded at present  @xcite , but they surely have been deserted by all cosmologists apart from a few dedicated cosmic - string _",
    "aficionados_.    the problem of a standard cdm cosmology depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] can be patched up in a variety of ways .",
    "one may tinker with the primordial fluctuation spectrum which may have been almost , but not quite , of the harrison - zeldovich form .",
    "one example of such a `` tilted cold dark matter '' ( tcdm ) result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] .",
    "another patch - up is to invoke a mixed hot plus cold dark matter ( mdm or chdm ) cosmology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] ) where the hot component erases enough of the initial power on small scales to compensate for the overproduction by pure cdm  @xcite . in a flat universe ( @xmath34 )",
    "the best fit is obtained with a total mass in neutrinos corresponding to @xmath35 with an equipartition of the masses among the flavors .",
    "granted that something like a cdm cosmology describes our universe , how will we ever know if it contains a small component of neutrino dark matter ?",
    "one crucial source of information will be the precision sky maps of the cosmic microwave background from the future map and planck surveyor ( formely cobras / samba ) satellites  @xcite .",
    "such sky maps are usually interpreted in terms of the multipole expansion of their power spectrum . for a pure cdm cosmology the expected power as a function of the multipole order @xmath36",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] as a solid line .",
    "the modified power spectra for three versions of a mixed hot plus cold dark matter cosmology are also shown .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the first ambition of current cosmic microwave experiments is to identify the first of the `` doppler peaks '' in the power spectrum .",
    "however , with the high angular resolution planned for the satellite experiments one will be able , in principle , to distinguish between the cdm and the mdm curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] .",
    "of course , there are other unknown cosmological parameters such as the overall mass density , the hubble constant , the cosmological constant , the baryon fraction , and so forth , which all affect the expected power spectrum .",
    "all of them have to be determined by fitting the power spectrum to the observations .",
    "therefore , it remains to be seen if a small neutrino component of the overall dark matter density can be identified in future cosmic microwave data .    in summary ,",
    "neutrinos as a universal dark matter particle are strongly disfavored , but with a mass of a few ev they could play a very useful role for structure formation and as a dark matter component which is less clustered than cdm . one may be able to identify the imprint of this component in future cosmic microwave sky maps .",
    "while neutrino masses would play a very important role in cosmology , it appears unlikely that cosmological arguments or observations alone will be able to prove or disprove this hypothesis anytime soon .",
    "therefore , the most realistic and systematic path is to search for neutrino oscillations .",
    "unsurprisingly , a vast amount of experimental effort is dedicated to this end . while there is yet no uncontestable positive signature for oscillations ,",
    "there exist a number of experimental `` anomalies '' that are best explained by this phenomenon .",
    "the most recent example is an experiment at los alamos where neutrinos are produced in a proton beam dump . the secondary positive pions decay according to @xmath37 and the muons according to @xmath38 . in the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd )",
    "about 30 meters downstream , a significant number of excess @xmath5 counts was obtained which can not be due to the primary source but which can be interpreted as the appearance of oscillated @xmath39 s  @xcite .",
    "if this interpretation were correct , the @xmath16-@xmath27 mass difference could be of order @xmath40 or more , pointing to cosmologically significant neutrino masses . at the present time one has to wait and see if more lsnd data and other experiments , notably karmen  @xcite , will confirm this claim .",
    "another indication for oscillations arises from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "their production is very similar to the lsnd experiment , except that the higher - energy cosmic - ray protons produce both positively and negatively charged pions and kaons in roughly equal proportions so that one expects about equally many neutrinos as antineutrinos , and a @xmath27:@xmath41 flavor ratio of about 2:1 .",
    "some measurements agree with this prediction  @xcite , but several detectors have observed a flavor ratio more like 1:1 ( `` atmospheric neutrino anomaly '' )  @xcite .",
    "further , kamiokande has seen an angular dependence of the flavor ratio as expected for oscillations due to the different path lengths through the earth from the atmosphere to the detector  @xcite and most recently superkamiokande had made a similar case  @xcite .",
    "these observations can be explained by @xmath27-@xmath16 or @xmath27-@xmath1 oscillations , but the former possibility is now ruled out by the chooz reactor experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27-@xmath1 oscillation interpretation requires nearly maximum mixing with a mass difference of about @xmath42 .",
    "the longest - standing hint for oscillations arises from solar neutrinos .",
    "the masses and mixing angles which are required to explain the measured flux deficits in terms of oscillations have been updated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but they remain close to the textbook values  @xcite .",
    "the two msw solutions indicate a mass difference around @xmath43 while the vacuum solution would require about @xmath44 .",
    "it is well known that these indications for oscillations require three different mass differences which are not compatible with each other .",
    "therefore , not all of the oscillation interpretations can be correct unless one appeals to neutrino degrees of freedom beyond the sequential flavors , i.e.  to the existence of sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile it remains of interest to look for astrophysical effects where neutrino oscillations could be important .",
    "neutrinos dominate the dynamics of the early universe and so it is natural to wonder if oscillations could be important there .",
    "however , because all flavors are in thermal equilibrium with each other the usual flavor oscillations would not change anything .",
    "oscillations into sterile neutrinos can have nontrivial and interesting effects  @xcite , but following the philosophy of this presentation of mostly ignoring everything other than masses and mixings for the sequential flavors i will not discuss these matters here .      concentrating on flavor oscillations between sequential neutrinos , supernovae",
    "are natural sites to look for nontrivial consequences .",
    "a type  ii sn occurs when a massive star ( @xmath45 ) has reached the end of its life .",
    "it consists of a degenerate iron core , surrounded by several shells of different nuclear burning phases .",
    "iron can not gain energy by nuclear fusion so that no further burning phase can be ignited .",
    "as the iron core grows in mass it eventually reaches its chandrasekhar limit of about @xmath46 , i.e.  the maximum mass that can be supported by electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "the subsequent collapse is halted only at nuclear densities where the equation of state stiffens , causing a shock wave to form at the edge of the inner core .",
    "it advances outward and eventually expels the mantle and envelope , an event which is observed as the sn explosion .",
    "the implosion of the core is transformed into an explosion of the outer parts of the star by this `` shock and bounce '' mechanism .",
    "most of the binding energy of the newly formed compact star is radiated away by neutrinos .",
    "the collapsed core is so hot and dense that even neutrinos are trapped .",
    "the cooling takes several seconds which corresponds to a neutrino diffusion time scale from the center to the `` neutrino sphere '' where these particles can escape .",
    "it is thought that the energy is roughly equipartitioned between all ( anti)neutrino flavors , but the spectra are different .",
    "various studies find for the average expected neutrino energy  @xcite @xmath47 the differences arise from the main trapping reactions , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 with @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the charged - current reactions have larger cross sections than the neutral - current ones and there are more neutrons than protons so that the @xmath16 s have the hardest time to escape .",
    "they emerge from the largest radii and thus from the coldest layers .    in detail",
    "the spectra formation depends subtly on the neutrino transport near the neutrino sphere  @xcite .",
    "a recent scrutiny of the neutrino interaction rates suggests that the spectral energies may be less different between the flavors than had been thought  @xcite , but a self - consistent implementation is not yet available .",
    "it is conceivable that ( resonant ) oscillations occur outside of the neutrino sphere so that the spectra between two flavors are swapped .",
    "this would affect the explosion mechanism itself which does not work quite as simple as described above . because the shock wave forms within the core it has to move through a layer of iron before reaching the stellar mantle . by",
    "dissociating iron it loses energy and stalls after a few @xmath53 in typical calculations .",
    "the deposition of energy by neutrinos which emerge from the inner core is thought to revive the shock so that it resumes its outward motion .",
    "however , this `` delayed explosion mechanism '' still does not seem to work in typical calculations because the transfer of energy to the shock wave is not efficient enough .    if neutrinos follow a `` normal '' mass hierarchy with @xmath16 dominated by the lightest mass eigenstate one can have msw oscillations between , say , @xmath16 and @xmath1 .",
    "if this occurs between the neutrino sphere and the stalling shock wave the @xmath16 s arriving there really are oscillated @xmath1 s and thus have the higher spectral energies characteristic for that flavor , leading to a more effective energy transfer to the shock wave @xcite . because the msw transition must occur close to the neutrino sphere where the matter densities are large , neutrino mass differences in the @xmath26 regime are required ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snoscillations ] ) .",
    "oscillations may also affect the r - process synthesis of heavy elements ( neutron capture ) which may well occur in the high - entropy `` hot bubble '' in a sn between the neutron star and the advancing shock wave a few seconds after collapse . because @xmath54 the @xmath23 processes shift the neutrino - driven wind to the required neutron - rich phase .",
    "however , if oscillations cause a spectral swap between , say , @xmath16 and @xmath1 this energy hierarchy is inverted and the wind is shifted to a proton - rich phase , preventing the occurrence of the r - process  @xcite . because this argument applies to a later phase than the explosion argument above",
    ", the neutron star has thermally settled so that the matter gradients at its surface are much steeper .",
    "this makes it harder to meet the adiabaticity condition , reducing the range of mixing angles where the msw effect operates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snoscillations ] ) .    at the present time it is not certain",
    "if r - process nucleosynthesis indeed occurs in supernovae so that the hatched are in fig .",
    "[ fig : snoscillations ] can not be taken as an exclusion plot .",
    "more importantly , there is a range of mixing parameters below the hatched region where the spectral swap is only partial and causes an _ increase _ of the neutron fraction , actually helping the r - process  @xcite .",
    "neutron stars ( pulsars ) usually have strong magnetic fields .",
    "they cause the neutrino refractive index to be anisotropic so that the msw resonance would not occur at precisely the same radius everywhere in the sn core . as a result",
    "the total neutrino luminosity may not be precisely isotropic , causing a small recoil of the newborn neutron star  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , if one can actually achieve the 12% anisotropy which is required to explain the observed pulsar velocities of around @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "oscillations would modify the sn  1987a neutrino signal , notably the `` prompt @xmath16 burst '' which precedes the main cooling phase .",
    "it arises when the shock wave breaks through the surface of the iron core , suddenly releasing @xmath16 s by the reactions @xmath56 from a layer encompassing perhaps a few @xmath57 . in the imb and kamiokande water cherenkov detectors which registered the sn  1987a signal",
    "the @xmath16-@xmath58 scattering reaction could have produced forward - peaked electrons as a signature for this burst , in agreement with the first event in kamiokande , although one would have expected only a fraction of an event .",
    "resonant oscillations would have transformed the @xmath16 burst into @xmath27 s or @xmath1 s which have a much smaller scattering cross section on electrons . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dirk ] the shaded triangle shows the mixing parameters for which the oscillation probability in the stellar mantle and envelope would have exceeded 50% . the small - angle msw solution is not in conflict with the interpretation that the first sn  1987a kamiokande event was indeed from @xmath16-@xmath58 scattering .",
    "of course , this single event does not lead to the opposite conclusion that the large - angle msw solution was ruled  out .",
    "most of the 19 events must have been due to the @xmath49 reaction . for a normal mass hierarchy",
    "resonant oscillations can not swap the @xmath5 spectra with another flavor ; they can affect only the @xmath16 spectrum .",
    "therefore , the observed events represent the original @xmath5 source spectrum unless the mixing angle is large enough to allow for significant nonresonant oscillations .",
    "large mixing angles are motivated by the large - angle msw and the vacuum solution to the solar neutrino problem as well as the oscillation interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "one way of interpreting the observed sn  1987a events is to derive best - fit values for the total binding energy @xmath59 and the spectral temperature of the observed @xmath5 s which is defined by @xmath60 . for certain mixing parameters and relative spectral temperatures @xmath61 the results from such an analysis  @xcite",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] . for @xmath62 oscillations",
    "have no effect ; this is identical to the no - oscillation scenario .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : energies ] ) a typical value for the relative spectral temperature is @xmath63 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the vacuum solution to the solar neutrino problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig : swap ] ) .",
    "the expected event energies in the detector would have been even larger than in the standard case , contrary to the relatively low energies that were actually observed . put another way ,",
    "if the vacuum solution to the solar neutrino problem is borne out by future experiments , there is a serious conflict between the sn  1987a observations and current theoretical predictions .",
    "for the large - angle msw solution the conflict is less severe ( fig .  [",
    "fig : swap ] ) . in this case",
    "the flavor evolution is adiabatic in the sn envelope so that propagation eigenstates emerge from the surface . on the path through the earth to the detectors",
    "matter - induced `` regeneration effects '' partly restore the original source spectra , reducing the overall impact of neutrino oscillations .    in summary ,",
    "the sn  1987a neutrino observations disfavor the large - angle solutions to the solar neutrino problem , even though the data are too sparse to reach this conclusion `` beyond reasonable doubt . ''",
    "in the absence of any compelling theoretical reason for neutrinos to be strictly massless it is commonplace to assume that they do carry small masses and that the flavors mix .",
    "cosmology provides by far the most restrictive limit of about @xmath0 on the mass of all sequential flavors .",
    "this limit can not be circumvented by decays unless neutrinos interact by new forces which allow for `` fast invisible '' ( i.e.  nonradiative ) channels .",
    "therefore , a neutrino mass in excess of the cosmological limit would signify that either the particle - physics or the cosmological standard model require nontrivial revisions .",
    "neutrinos are unfavored dark matter candidates because of the well - known problems of a hot dark matter cosmology .",
    "the cold dark matter picture works impressively well even though it appears to overproduce structure on small scales .",
    "this problem can be patched up by a number of different modifications , one of them being a hot plus cold dark matter scenario with a neutrino component corresponding to @xmath64 . however , it looks unlikely that this sort of scenario can be unambiguously identified by cosmological methods alone .",
    "even the most ambitious future cosmic microwave sky maps will have a hard time to identify this model unambiguously in view of the remaining uncertainty in other cosmological parameters .",
    "depending on the exact mixing parameters , neutrino oscillations have severe consequences for supernova physics and the signal interpretation of sn  1987a or a future galactic supernova .",
    "especially for neutrino masses in the cosmologically interesting regime , oscillations can affect the explosion mechanism and r - process nucleosynthesis . however , the current understanding of sn physics is too uncertain and the sn  1987a data are too sparse to tell if neutrino oscillations are either required or excluded .",
    "still , it remains fascinating that a neutrino mass as small as a few ev has _ any _ significant consequences outside of cosmology .    even though massive neutrinos may play an important role in cosmology and supernova physics ,",
    "realistically we will know if this is indeed the case only by more direct measurements .",
    "the most promising approach is by oscillation experiments .",
    "already , oscillations can explain the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , the lsnd @xmath5 excess counts , and the solar neutrino problem even though a simultaneous explanation of all three phenomena is not possible by flavor oscillations between sequential neutrinos alone .",
    "if neutrinos do have masses and if their mass differences are as small as suggested by solar and atmospheric neutrinos , then a cosmological role is only possible if all three mass eigenvalues are in the ev range and almost equal .",
    "the common scale of these quasi - degenerate masses can not be determined in oscillation experiments .",
    "therefore , it remains of utmost importance to push tritium @xmath23 decay and neutrinoless @xmath65 decay experiments below the @xmath40 threshold for @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , it remains of utmost importance to measure the neutrino light curve from a future galactic supernova with a high - statistics experiment such as superkamiokande or the proposed omnis  @xcite . besides a wealth of other information",
    "one would be sensitive to an ev mass for @xmath16 and to the @xmath67 scale for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
