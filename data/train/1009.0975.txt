    "over the last several years , there have been significant progresses in the production of ultracold gases , which realize the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , two boson mixtures @xcite , degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite , and bose - fermi ( bf ) mixing gases @xcite . in particular the bf mixtures attract physical interest as a typical example in which particles obeying different statistics are intermingled .",
    "using the system we have a very big opportunity to get various new knowledge about many - body quantum systems because we can make a large variety of combinations of atomic species and control the atomic interactions using the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the bf mixtures have been done for static properties @xcite , for the phase diagram and phase separation @xcite , for stability @xcite and for collective excitations @xcite .",
    "recently kyoto university group has performed researches on the trapped atomic gases of the yb isotopes : the bec @xcite and the fermi - degeneracy @xcite .",
    "they also succeeded in realizing the bf mixtures of the isotopes .",
    "the yb consists of many kinds of isotopes five bosons ( @xmath4yb ) and two fermions ( @xmath5yb ) , which give a variety of combinations in the bf mixtures .",
    "the scattering lengths for the boson - fermion interactions have been determined experimentally by the group @xcite , and the observation of the ground state properties and the collective oscillations of the bf mixtures is now under progressing .    in many characteristic properties , the spectrum of the collective excitations is an important diagnostic signal of these systems ; they are common in many - particle systems and are often sensitive to the interaction and the structure of the ground and the excited states .",
    "we have constructed a time - dependent dynamical approach with the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( tdgp ) and vlasov equations , and have studied the monopole @xcite and dipole oscillations @xcite of the bf mixtures . in these works , we have found that collective motions in the bf mixtures include various modes such as the boson and fermion intrinsic modes , the forced oscillation modes and so on .",
    "then the intrinsic frequencies of these modes in our approach are different from those in the sum - rule @xcite and the scaling @xcite approaches , which are approximations of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore the time - dependent behaviors in our approach are the same as those in rpa only in the early time , and show difference in latter time .",
    "as the boson - fermion interaction becomes stronger , the difference appears in earlier time .",
    "thus the bf mixing gases show new dynamical properties different from the other finite many - body systems such as atomic nuclei .",
    "we choose three combinations of the yb isotopes , @xmath0yb-@xmath1yb , @xmath0yb-@xmath2yband @xmath3yb-@xmath2yb , whose boson - fermion interactions are weakly repulsive , strongly attractive and strongly repulsive . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the quadrupole oscillation of these mixtures in the spherical trap using the time - dependent dynamical approach , and then compared the results with those obtained in rpa .",
    "the rpa predicts the same intrinsic modes as the dynamical approach , but it describes the whole oscillations of the mixture as linear combination of the intrinsic modes . when the bf interaction is weak , and/or the amplitude is small , the linearly - combined oscillations can be good approximation , so that the rpa gives the results consistent with those in the dynamical approach .",
    "however , when the bf interaction is strong , or the amplitude is large , the oscillations of the bf mixtures obtained in the dynamical approach show the very different behaviors from the rpa ; in the strongly - attractive bf interaction , the fermi gas overflows from the boson occupation region and makes large expansion , which leads to a monopole oscillation mode . in the case of the strongly - repulsive interaction ,",
    "the fermion intrinsic - mode has rapid damping , so that the fermi gas comes to co - oscillate with the bose gas .    in actual experiments ,",
    "the largely - deformed trap of axial - symmetry is used , and the oscillation behaviors may be different from those in the spherical trap .",
    "the monopole and quadrupole oscillations , which are coupled in axial - symmetric traps , are recombined into two modes oscillating along the symmetric axial and the transverse directions .",
    "such behaviors are observed in the two - component fermi - gas oscillations @xcite , but no studies have been done for the bf mixture .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the breathing oscillations of the bf mixtures in the largely deformed system of the prolate shape .",
    "then we examine oscillation behaviors along the longitudinal and transverse directions separately , which are defined as the directions of the symmetry axis and perpendicular to it , respectively .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the dynamical model to calculate the time evolution of the system . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine the intrinsic collective modes and their coupling behaviors in the scaling method . in sec .",
    "iv , we show the time - development calculations in the tdhf+vlasov approach for the breathing oscillations in the bf mixture , and discuss their properties .",

    ", we discuss the bf - interaction dependence of the intrinsic - mode frequencies obtained in the tdgp+vlasov approach , and compare them with those in the scaling method .",
    "[ frcdp ] shows the @xmath149-dependence of the boson and fermion intrinsic frequencies , which are obtained from the peak frequencies of the strength functions .",
    "the boson and longitudinal fermion oscillations are found to have small @xmath149-dependence and the scaling method well reproduces the time - dependent calculations for these oscillations .",
    "the fermion transverse oscillation has large interaction dependence , and the scaling method can not reproduce the tdgp+vlasov calculation ( fig .",
    "[ frcdp ] ) , especially at @xmath211 ( large repulsive bf interaction ) . in the scaling method calculation , the frequency of the ftb mode has the minimum around @xmath212 , and increases with increase of @xmath149 in the region of @xmath146 ( fig .",
    "[ frcdp ] , solid line ) ; it comes from the structure change of the fermion ground - state density distribution into the surface - peaked shape ( fig .",
    "[ grdrh ] ) . on the other hand , in the tdgp+vlasov approach",
    ", the density distribution and the velocity field varies in time in large amplitude oscillations . in the mixture of @xmath146 ,",
    "the minimum position of the fermion potential is on the spherical surface at the border of the boson density distribution , and the fermion gas oscillates around this surface ; it results in the frequency of the fermion transverse mode smaller than that in the sum - rule .",
    "the same discrepancy appears in the dipole and quadrupole oscillations in the spherical trap@xcite .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse modes are found to decouple , and the frequencies of the boson and fermion intrinsic oscillations are very close . thus the boson and fermion gases can easily oscillate with the same period ; it also explains the convergence into the bf in - phase mode in the transverse oscillation , which has been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the collective breathing oscillation of the bf mixtures of yb isotopes in the deformed trap ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "three combinations were examined : @xmath0yb-@xmath1yb , @xmath0yb-@xmath2yband @xmath3yb-@xmath2yb , where the bf interactions are weakly repulsive , strongly attractive and strongly repulsive .    in the case of the weak bf interactions , the longitudinal and transversal breathing oscillations decouple in the largely deformed trap of prolate shape . because of the large interaction energy coming from the condensed bosons , the boson breathing oscillations couple into the intrinsic btb and bab modes , and the intrinsic ftb and fab modes are made from the fermion oscillations .",
    "the actual time - development processes are described by the superposition of these intrinsic modes .      in the spherical trap ,",
    "the fermion oscillation have been shown to have the boson - forced oscillation modes and the two intrinsic modes which correspond to the inside- and outside - fermion oscillations for the boson - distributed regions . in the present prolate deformed trap ,",
    "no outside - fermion modes appear .",
    "the longitudinal oscillations are rather simple ; they are approximately monotonous in the boson and fermion oscillations in the all bf mixtures . for the in - phase initial condition",
    ", the bab mode and the fermion intrinsic modes appear in the boson and fermion oscillations , respectively .",
    "the transverse breathing oscillations have complex structures as clarified in iv d , and they depend on the strength of the bf interactions . in the fermion transverse breathing oscillations , we found that the fermion - gas frequencies vary in time and converges into the same frequencies with the boson oscillations and the relative phases of the boson and fermion oscillations become in - phase .",
    "this phenomenon are shown to be explained by the damping of the intrinsic fermion modes and the boson - forced oscillations .    in this paper , we discussed the collective oscillations of the bf mixtures of yb isotopes at @xmath214 . in the actual experiments , which should be done at very low but @xmath215 temperatures , thermal bosons should give some contributions ; the introduction of such effects into the present approach through two - body collision terms @xcite should be done also in the future .",
