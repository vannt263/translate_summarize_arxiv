    "spatio - temporal structures as well as fluctuations are essential features of epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "a description of epidemic spreading that takes into account these essential features is provided by stochastic lattice models @xcite in which each site of a lattice is occupied by an individual that can be in one of a certain number of states . in the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite , an important model in this context , the possible states are susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) or recovered ( r ) .",
    "the sir model is composed by two processes .",
    "one in which a susceptible becomes infected by a catalytic reaction , s+i@xmath0i+i , and another in which an infected becomes recovered spontaneously , i@xmath0r .",
    "another model , the one that will be the object our study here , is the susceptible - exposed - infected ( sei ) , introduced by tom and de oliveira @xcite , in which each individual can be susceptible ( s ) , exposed ( e ) or infected ( i ) .",
    "this model has also two processes . in the presence of an infected individual ,",
    "a susceptible individual may become either infected or exposed , processes represented by the reactions s+i@xmath0i+i and s+i@xmath0e+i , respectively .",
    "the distinguish features of these two models are as follows .",
    "the spreading of the epidemic occurs as long as there are active sites , which are the sites occupied by a susceptible individual next to an infected individual .",
    "when the active sites have disappeared , the infection reaction s+i@xmath0i+i no longer takes place , that is , no new infected individuals are created , and the whole process eventually stops .",
    "the system finds itself in one of many absorbing states which , in the sir model , are the configurations formed by r and s sites and , in the sei model , are the configurations without any pair of neighboring si sites . starting from a configuration full of susceptible individuals except for a single infected site , the process generates a cluster of inactive sites , which are the r sites of the sir model and the i sites of the sei model . in the stationary state , which is an absorbing state ,",
    "these clusters have the same properties as the clusters occurring in isotropic percolation model so that the stationary properties of these two models are similar to percolation .",
    "when the rate of infection is small there is no epidemic spreading , that is , the generated clusters are all finite .",
    "if however the infection rate is large enough , an infinite cluster of inactive sites is generated and the epidemic spreading takes place .",
    "the transition from non - spreading to spreading is regarded as a continuous phase transition with critical behavior within the universality class of dynamical percolation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the clusters generated by the rules of the sei model can be exactly mapped into the clusters of site percolation so that the stationary properties of the sei model are identical to the properties of site percolation . in this sense , it is similar to the model introduced by alexandrowicz @xcite to generate percolation clusters .",
    "the sei model can thus be regarded as a standard example of a model belonging to the dynamical percolation universality class .",
    "here we are concerned with the critical behavior of the sei model on a square lattice , particularly with the numerical calculation of the dynamic critical exponents . as to the static critical exponents , they are the same as the percolation in two dimensions and known exactly @xcite . here",
    "we perform calculation for the sei model with results for the dynamic critical exponents that are very accurate , and in agreement with the exponents of the dynamic percolation universality class @xcite .",
    "the sei model is a continuous time stochastic markovian process defined on a lattice where each site can be in one of three states : s , i or e. the allowed transitions are those in which just one site changes its state .",
    "the transition rate of the process s@xmath0i is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fraction of i sites in the neighborhood of the site to be updated and @xmath3 is the infection parameter .",
    "the transition rate of the process s@xmath0e is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the exposition parameter .",
    "other transitions are forbidden so that sites in states i or e remain forever in these states . for convenience ,",
    "we define the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 so that @xmath8 .",
    "the model displays two regimes .",
    "one in which there is no epidemic spreading , occurring for small infection rate , and the other in which the epidemic spreading takes place , occurring for large infection rate .",
    "the stationary properties are close related to site percolation model . in fact , the cluster of i sites can be exactly mapped into the cluster of site percolation in the same lattice , in which each site is occupied with probability @xmath9 , as will be shown below .",
    "it is well known that the percolation model @xcite shows a phase transition from a state with finite clusters , occurring for @xmath10 , to a state with an infinite cluster , or percolating state , for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the critical concentration .",
    "we thus expect for the sei model , a transition from a non - spreading regime , for @xmath10 , to a spreading regime , for @xmath11 .",
    "the simulation of the model is carried out as follows .",
    "each site of a regular lattice with @xmath13 sites can be in one of three states : occupied by a susceptible ( s ) , by an infected ( i ) or by an exposed ( e ) individual . at each time",
    "step a site is chosen at random . if it is in the i or e states nothing happens .",
    "if it is in the state s then with probability @xmath14 it becomes i and with probability @xmath15 it becomes e , where @xmath2 is the fraction of i sites in the neighborhood of the chosen site and @xmath8 .",
    "equivalently , if the chosen site is in state s , we may randomly choose a neighboring site ; if it is in the i state then the chosen site becomes i with probability @xmath9 or e with the complementary probability @xmath16 .",
    "the time is increased by an amount equal to @xmath17 .",
    "the neighborhood of a site is defined as its nearest neighbor sites .",
    "an alternative approach , useful for time dependent simulations , is carried out as follows . at each time step , a site is chosen at random from a list comprising the i sites only .",
    "next , one of its neighbors is chosen at random .",
    "if this neighbor is in state i or e nothing happens . if it is in state s , then it changes to i with probability @xmath9 or to e with probability @xmath16 .",
    "the time is increased by an amount equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of sites in the list , which is the total number of i sites in the lattice , and the list is updated .",
    "an even more efficient algorithm is set up by using a list of active pair of sites , more precisely , a list of nearest neighbor pairs of susceptible - infected sites . at each time step ,",
    "a pair of the list is chosen at random and the s site of the pair becomes i with probability @xmath9 or e with probability @xmath16 . the time is increased by an amount @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of entries in the list , which is the total number of si pairs in the lattice , and the list is updated .",
    "let us consider a finite lattice full of susceptible individual except for one site which is occupied by an infected individual .",
    "the system evolves in time and eventually reaches its final state which comprises a connected cluster of infected sites in addition to exposed and susceptible sites .",
    "the exposed sites are found at the boundary of the cluster separating the infected sites from the susceptible sites , so that active sites are absent .",
    "the clusters generated by the sei rules are the same clusters of site percolation , as we show next , in which the sites are occupied independently with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the mapping of the stationary properties of the sei model into the site percolation model can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose that a cluster c of infected sites of a lattice has been generated by one of the algorithm above , starting from an infected site at the origin .",
    "suppose moreover that the dynamics has come to a halt so that there are no pairs of the type si .",
    "the boundary b of this cluster is therefore composed only by e sites . during the dynamics , whenever the site @xmath22 becomes either i or e , we keep the used random number @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that , if site @xmath22 has turned into an i site then @xmath24 ; if site @xmath22 has turned into an e site then @xmath25 . let us now consider a replica of the lattice , with all sites empty except the site at the origin which is occupied .",
    "next the site @xmath22 of the replica is occupied if @xmath24 and remains empty if @xmath25 . by means of this procedure , which is the procedure used in site percolation ,",
    "a cluster of occupied sites is generated , which is thus identical to the cluster of i sites of the original lattice .",
    "around the critical point , the quantities that characterize the system are assumed to obey a scaling relation .",
    "we assume two types of scaling relation .",
    "the first one is a finite - size scaling relation , valid at the stationary state . a certain quantity @xmath26 depends on the linear size of the system @xmath27 and on the deviation @xmath28 according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the critical exponents related to the spatial correlation length and @xmath31 is the critical exponent related to @xmath26 in the thermodynamic limit , that is , @xmath32 when @xmath33 .",
    "the second type is a time dependent scaling relation , valid for an infinite system , and given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the critical exponents related to the time correlation length . when @xmath36 , we get the same behavior @xmath32 . at the critical point ,",
    "relations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) predict the following scaling forms @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 .",
    "the behavior of the sei model is characterized by a set of quantities .",
    "we define the average @xmath39 where @xmath19 is the number of infected sites and the average @xmath40 in the number of active pair of sites defined as the number @xmath21 of pairs of neighboring sites of type si .",
    "another relevant quantity is the surviving probability @xmath41 , defined as the probability that at time @xmath42 the system is active , that is , as long @xmath43 .",
    "starting from one infected site in a infinite lattice full of susceptible , we expect the following asymptotic time behavior , at the critical point , @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spatial correlation length and @xmath49 .    if several trials are carried out , some survive up to time @xmath42 , some do not . in the limit @xmath36 , the cluster of a surving trial will be identified with the infinite percolating cluster .",
    "let @xmath50 be the variable that counts the number of infected sites in the surviving trials .",
    "denoting by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the number of trials and the number of surviving trials , respectively , and by @xmath53 the number of infected sites in the @xmath22-th surviving trial , then the average @xmath54 of @xmath50 over the surving trials is given by @xmath55 the quantity between parentheses , which we denote by @xmath56 , is the average number of @xmath50 over all trials because @xmath57 for a nonsurviving trial .",
    "taking into account that @xmath58 then @xmath59 .",
    "now , the quantity @xmath56 has a behavior similar to the average @xmath60 of @xmath19 over all trials .",
    "in fact , we found numerically that @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath60 for large enough @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , for large enough @xmath42 we may write @xmath61 . taking into account relations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath62    the number of infected sites in surviving trials inside a region of linear size @xmath48 is proportional to the order parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this amounts to say that the ratio @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "writing thus @xmath65 , and taking into account relations ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , we reach the following exponent relation @xmath66 at the critical point a surviving trial , which makes up the percolating cluster , has a fractal structure with a fractal dimension @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 comparing ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) with ( [ 23 ] ) , we see that the fractal dimension @xmath67 of the critical cluster is related to @xmath69 and @xmath70 by @xmath71    the exponents @xmath72 and @xmath69 are connected by the relation @xmath73 which can be understood by observing that the rate of increase in the average number of infected sites is proportional to the number of active pair of sites , that is , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of neighbors . replacing ( [ 6 ] ) into (",
    "[ 12 ] ) , it follows that @xmath76 from which we find relation ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we should remark that in models belonging to direct percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite , @xmath77 so that the exponents @xmath69 and @xmath72 coincide . in the case of models belonging to dynamical percolation universality class , such as the sir and sei models , they are distinct and are related by ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath36 , that is , in the stationary state , the surviving probability , which is identified with the order parameter , behaves around the critical point as @xmath78 and the exponent @xmath79 is related to @xmath70 by @xmath80 which is equivalent to @xmath81 .",
    "taking into account this relation and comparing relations ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 13a ] ) , we find @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the density @xmath85 of infected sites is equal to to @xmath86 .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath87 and that @xmath88 , we conclude that @xmath89 so that @xmath90 let us define the quantity @xmath91 . taking into account that @xmath92 and that @xmath93 around the critical point , we may conclude that @xmath94 , or @xmath95 the quantity @xmath96 , defined as the ratio @xmath97 behaves as @xmath98    scaling relations can be written for the quantities defined above .",
    "for instance , the order parameter obeys the scaling relation @xmath99 from the above relations for @xmath96 and @xmath63 , it follows that the product @xmath100 approaches a constant at the critical point and obeys the relation @xcite @xmath101 so that , at the critical point , @xmath102 , a plot of @xmath100 versus @xmath9 for several values of @xmath27 will cross at the same point , the critical point .",
    "we performed numerical simulation on a square lattice by using the algorithms explained above .",
    "the stationary properties were obtained on lattices of several sizes , and for several values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath63 was obtained as follows @xcite .",
    "we perform several runs starting from an infected individual placed in the center of a finite lattice full of susceptible individuals .",
    "the quantity @xmath103 is the fraction of runs such that an infected individual reaches the border of the lattice of linear size @xmath27 . in figure",
    "[ estac]a we show the order parameter @xmath63 versus @xmath9 for several values of @xmath27 .",
    "the inset of figure [ estac]a shows a data colapse according to the scaling form ( [ 15 ] ) . to get the data colapse we used the exact values of the percolation exponents in two dimensions @xcite : @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we used also the numerical value of @xmath9 at the critical point on a square lattice , @xmath106 obtained from monte carlo simulations @xcite .    in figure [ estac]b , we show the product @xmath100 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "as expected from scaling relation ( [ 13 ] ) the curves for distinct @xmath27 cross at the critical point .",
    "the value of @xmath100 at @xmath12 is estimated to be @xmath107 , which is a linear extrapolation in @xmath108 obtained from the values 1.016598 , 1.016585 , 1.016582 of this quantity for @xmath109 respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 at @xmath12 is a universal quantity and may be compared to the values 1.0167(1 ) obtained for percolation and sir models @xcite .",
    "the inset of figure [ estac]b shows the data collapse according to ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "again we use the exact value @xmath105 .    to get the dynamic exponents defined by relations ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) , we performed time - dependent monte carlo simulations at the critical point @xmath106 @xcite . to get the exponents @xmath69 , @xmath72 and @xmath70 , we have estimated the number of infected sites @xmath60 , the number of active pair of sites @xmath110 and the surviving probability @xmath63 .",

    "each curve corresponds to an average over @xmath117 runs obtained on a square lattice of linear size @xmath118 . at each run , the lattice was full of susceptible sites except the central site , which is in an infected state . up to the maximum time",
    "shown in figure [ qcm ] no infected site reached the border of the lattice , which amounts to say that the results shown in figure [ qcm ] are valid for an infinite lattice .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to estimate the exponent @xmath123 for a given quantity @xmath124 , we used a correction to scaling of the form @xcite @xmath125 the fitting of this form to the data points gives the exponent @xmath123 and @xmath126 in addition to the constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the fitting was done within a certain interval of time starting at time @xmath121 and ending at time @xmath122 .",
    "we have found that the best fittings give @xmath126 around 1 , but the actual values found for the exponent @xmath123 are not too sensitive to the value of the exponent @xmath126 .",
    "we used three values of @xmath121 and the same value of @xmath122 .",
    "as seen in table [ exponents ] , the three values of a given exponent are distinct but very similar allowing the estimation of the statistical error shown in the last row together with the average .",
    "the estimated exponents can be checked by using relations @xmath129 and @xmath130 . from the values of @xmath69 and @xmath111",

    "notice that the critical exponents @xmath69 and @xmath72 satisfy , within the statistical error , the relation ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath135 .",
    "we have determined the critical properties of the sei model on a square lattice by numerical simulations .",
    "the model is an example of model belonging to the universality class of dynamical percolation .",
