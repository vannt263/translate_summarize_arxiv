    "graphene was discovered in late 2004 @xcite .",
    "this material is a one - atom thick sheet of carbon atoms , arranged in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "this structure is not a bravais lattice and graphene is described in terms of a triangular lattice with a two - atom basis .",
    "a simple nearest - neighbour tight - binding approximation of the electronic hamiltonian in graphene reveals that such lattice structure leads to a dispersion relation that is linear around two specific points of the brillouin zone .",
    "since the fermi level of graphene lies at these points , its quasi - particles behave in a continuum approximation as massless relativistic fermions with a speed of light equal to the fermi - velocity @xmath0 ( see @xcite and the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of graphene and its special geometry make it a very interesting candidate for applications in nano - electronics .",
    "recent research has revealed other possible applications , in solar cell technology @xcite , in liquid crystal devices @xcite , in single molecule sensors @xcite , and in the fabrication of nano - sized prototype transistors @xcite .",
    "transport measurements on graphene devices @xcite have become standard and can be performed under different doping conditions .",
    "given the location of the fermi level and the absence of a band gap between the valence and conduction bands in undoped graphene , one can continuously control the level of doping simply by the application of a gate voltage in a geometry where graphene acts as the upper ( grounded ) electrode of a capacitor .",
    "the lower electrode is composed of silicon , whereas the dielectric medium in between is sio@xmath1 .",
    "metal contacts placed on top of the graphene sheet allow for the realisation of transport measurements at different gate voltages , and hence at different levels of doping , with great flexibility .",
    "the system has an overall thickness of @xmath2 nm ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the measurement of the transport properties using such devices can be used to determine the influence of different physical effects on both the ac and dc conductivities .",
    "one can investigate the influence of electron - electron interactions , of impurities , or of the presence of elastic ripples in the graphene sheet on the transport properties of this semi - metal @xcite .",
    "it well known that undoped graphene , when analysed from the point of view of a self - consistent theory or the renormalisation group , presents a finite conductivity with an universal value of @xmath3 @xcite , regardless of the scattering mechanism that limits conductivity in graphene . the experimental measurements@xcite point to a somewhat higher value for this quantity , equal to @xmath4 .",
    "this latter value is also obtained in studies of numerical diagonalisation of graphene s tight - binding hamiltonian with add - atoms acting as the source of disorder@xcite . in the case of doped graphene ,",
    "the behaviour of the conductivity markedly depends on the scattering mechanism that limits such quantity .",
    "it is therefore essential to clarify the nature of such a mechanism .",
    "the research community has held two opposing views , namely charged ( coulomb ) or short - range scatterers @xcite , but recent experiments @xcite seem to show the latter mechanism as the prevailing one , even if it is agreed that charged scatterers also play a role @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the contribution to the conductivity of one particular type of short - range disorder , namely that induced by the deposition of transition metal ( tm ) atoms in graphene @xcite .",
    "this type of disorder is always present on devices such as those depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] , due to the diffusion of metallic atoms from the contacts into the graphene sheet .",
    "the adsorption of graphene on tm surfaces has been extensively studied , both experimentally @xcite , as well as theoretically @xcite . in tm surfaces for which the adsorption process ( physisorption ) preserves the conical nature of the graphene bands close to the dirac point ( al , ag , cu , au , pt )",
    ", the authors of @xcite have shown that the levels of electron or hole doping of graphene that they have found in their dft studies can be explained by the relative value of the bulk work - functions of graphene and of that of the transition metal to which graphene is adsorbed . however , in order to explain the electron - doping of graphene in cases where its work - function is lower than that of the transition metal ( ag , cu ) , the authors invoked the existence of a chemical interaction between graphene and the underlying metal substrate , which plays a significant role in the formation of surface dipoles@xcite .",
    "the existence of such an interaction was confirmed in the experimental transport studies of @xcite , performed on a graphene sheet where tm atoms were deposited , which was part of device such as that of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the authors of this study have found that in the case of low coverage of graphene by pt , the metal with the highest work function studied theoretically by @xcite , graphene is also electronically doped by pt , becoming hole - doped at higher coverages .",
    "the authors stated that the high levels of electron - doping that they have found at low coverages were caused by an increased chemical interaction between graphene and the tm atoms , due to the short - distance ( less than @xmath5 a ) between the two species ( this distance is equal to @xmath6 a in the full coverage regime ) .",
    "furthermore , the afm pictures obtained seem to show that the transition metal atoms aggregate in clusters at low coverage ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is nevertheless unclear whether the proximity between the clusters and graphene is sufficient to justify the level of doping of graphene .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "firstly , we wish to introduce a framework that allow us to discuss the problem of charge doping of graphene by transition - metal clusters with generality from a thermodynamic point of view .",
    "this framework will be of a phenomenological nature and it will involve some simplifying assumptions , but it will already contain the main ingredients that will need to be considered in a more fundamental approach . secondly , the same type of phenomenological analysis will be extended to the problem of electronic scattering in graphene caused by the presence of the said clusters .",
    "we will show , following @xcite that , despite the charged nature of the clusters , the scattering potential that they create is of a short - ranged nature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the domain of validity of the semi - classical approximation of independent clusters that we are using is also discussed .",
    "thirdly , these two elements of the theory will be used to interpret the above experiments from a quantitative point of view .",
    "this application of the theory will also serve to illustrate its overall limitations and we will provide physical arguments that show why more elaborate approaches are needed .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ seco ] , we will discuss the doping of graphene by metal clusters in a capacitor device based on a phenomenological model that treats each cluster as a perfectly metallic object kept at a constant potential dependent on the amount of charge in the cluster .",
    "the minimisation of the internal energy of the system at @xmath7 , subjected to overall charge conservation , will allows us to obtain the equilibrium conditions that determine the level of doping of the graphene sheet .",
    "one can show , for equally charged clusters , that the level of doping can be written in terms of the bulk work - functions of the different components of the system , of the gate voltage applied to the device , and of a parameter that characterises the _ effective _ chemical interaction between the graphene sheet and each individual cluster .",
    "the numerical value of this parameter is determined by two different contributions : the first contribution is due to the induced surface dipole of graphene and of the metallic clusters caused by the presence of the other components of the system ; the second contribution is the correction to the fermi energy of a cluster due to its finite size .",
    "specialising to the case of spherical clusters , we can estimate the magnitude of the chemical interaction using the measured values by@xcite of the gate voltage that is necessary to apply to pt and ti - covered@xcite graphene samples to bring graphene to an uncharged state , where the conductivity is a minimum .",
    "these values are dependent on the concentration of metallic atoms per unit cell as well as on which metallic element is deposited on graphene . in section [ secb ] , we will consider the form of the scattering potential created by a spherical cluster , following the model of @xcite and its contribution to the resistivity of the sample , within the first born approximation ( fba ) and we will compare our results with the transport measurements of@xcite , performed on pt - covered graphene samples at low coverage",
    ". we will also show why the theory presented is not adequate to explain the measurements performed at higher coverages , both for pt and ti - covered samples .",
    "we will determine , using the above model , the linear dimension of the region in graphene where the charge donated by the cluster to this material is contained and show that , except for the lowest coverages considered in the experiments of@xcite , this quantity is comparable to the average distance between clusters , even for heavily - doped graphene . in section [ secc ] , we will present our conclusions . in appendix [ appo ] , we will derive an expression for the cluster s ionisation potential that will be used in the main text , based on the same thermodynamic arguments that were used in section [ seco ]",
    ". finally , in appendix [ seca ] , we will derive , using the method of images , the electrostatic contribution to the ionisation potential of a single spherical cluster , a result that will be shown to be in agreement with that of appendix [ appo ] . this derivation will also allow us to obtain the capacitance of the system composed of the metallic cluster and of the graphene plane , as well as the electrostatic potential due to a charged spherical cluster close to a grounded plane , a quantity that enters in the calculations performed in section [ secb ] .",
    "at @xmath7 , the internal energy of a composite system of @xmath8 conductors can be written@xcite , assuming that the electrons and the ( immobile ) ions of the different species interact with each other via the bare coulomb interaction ( i.e. one is including the contribution of the low lying electronic orbitals explicitly in the energy ) , as @xmath9 where the functional @xmath10 includes the kinetic , exchange and correlation energies of the electrons and where the second term includes the effect of the ion potential on the electrons and the hartree energy of these electrons , with @xmath11 being the plasma charge density .",
    "the indices @xmath12 run over @xmath13 .",
    "one can write @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the charge density in the neutral ground state of each conductor and @xmath16 is the excess charge density of that conductor due to charge exchange with the others .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 , the total unbalanced charged contained in conductor @xmath18 . using this decomposition",
    ", one can write the ground - state energy , up to a constant term , as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the potential on conductor @xmath18 due to itself and the other conductors , each in a neutral state . in a classical approximation",
    ", @xmath16 will be non - zero only close to the surface of the conductors , and we can write the above expression in a capacitor approximation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse cross - capacitance between conductors @xmath18 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the surface dipole of conductor @xmath18@xcite , which is the average value of the electrostatic potential within that conductor .",
    "note that the surface dipole of a conductor is computed with the remaining conductors present , but in a neutral state .",
    "thus , one expects that such surface dipoles will depend both on the geometry of each conductor and also on the presence of the other conductors if the distances between them are on the atomic scale .",
    "as stated above , the experiments of reference @xcite were performed on a devices similar to that depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] , with the transition metal atoms deposited by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on the graphene sheet at different coverages @xmath25 of metallic atoms per unit cell of graphene , where @xmath26 is the total number of deposited metallic atoms and @xmath27 is the number of graphene s unit cells . in order to model such a device",
    ", we will assume that the atoms aggregate in @xmath28 identical clusters , which are randomly distributed above the area @xmath29 of the graphene sheet , where @xmath30 is the area of the graphene unit cell .",
    "we also assume that these clusters are all equally charged .",
    "the graphene sheet is kept at zero potential . at a distance @xmath31",
    "nm below it , one places a si layer , with the space in between filled with sio@xmath1 , a medium of permittivity @xmath32 .",
    "the graphene sheet and the si layer are connected to a battery such that a constant gate - voltage @xmath33 is kept between them ( plane - capacitor model , see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "a single cluster - graphene subsystem is assumed to possess a joint capacitance @xmath34 ( which is computed for spherical clusters in appendix [ seca ] ) .",
    "the capacitance of the graphene / sio@xmath1/si device is given by @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the cross - capacitance effects between different clusters are only due to the presence of the grounded graphene plane , an assumption that is correct for small @xmath36@xcite .        with such assumptions",
    ", the internal energy ( [ eq0m3 ] ) can be written for this system , as @xmath37 we have written the charge @xmath38 of a given component @xmath18 as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the number of electrons in a cluster ( all clusters are equally charged ) , in graphene and in the si layer in the equilibrium state in which these materials are in contact and exchange charge , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the same quantities in the uncharged state of these materials . also , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the surface dipoles of each substance .",
    "the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium are obtained through the minimisation of ( [ eq01 ] ) subjected to the constraints that the overall charge of the system is zero and that the potential difference between the two electrodes of the battery is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the minimisation condition is thus given by @xmath49 since the charge transferred between the electrodes of the battery is @xmath50 , and where @xmath51 is the chemical potential of the system .",
    "one obtains from ( [ eq02 ] ) the following equilibrium conditions @xmath52 where @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the number of charges in cluster @xmath23 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , are the chemical potentials of the different components of the system in the absence of a dipole layer .",
    "these quantities are also called the internal contribution of a metal to its work - function@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath57 , i.e. the chemical potential of the system is equal to the ( full ) chemical potential of the subsystem kept at zero voltage .",
    "the two equilibrium conditions ( [ eq03],[eq04 ] ) are not sufficient to determine the level of doping of the constituents of the system .",
    "these equations have to be supplemented with the neutrality condition for the overall system .",
    "one can write this condition as @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the quantities that appear in ( [ eq05 ] ) are related to the variations of the carrier density of the cluster , of graphene , and of the si layer , by @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the volume of the cluster .",

    "according to the studies of @xcite , ti is chemically adsorbed in graphene and does not preserve the dirac point in the newly computed band structure .",

    "the experimental results of @xcite allow one to place a limit on the minimal distance between the clusters and the graphene sheet , i.e. @xmath430 a. we have therefore chosen @xmath431 a , although the results for @xmath105 are only very weakly dependent on @xmath432 , unlike what happens with @xmath134 .",

    "this value is similar to the average ionisation energy of @xmath434 ev of an isolated ti atom , if we consider the average doping of @xmath435 e / ti atom , using the first and second ionisation energies of the titanium atom .",
    "the relative coincidence of these two values may help explain why one is still able to apply a continuum theory to describe essentially isolated titanium atoms .",
    "the computed work - function of graphene adsorbed on ( 111 ) platinum in @xcite is @xmath436 ev with @xmath437 .",
    "this is to be compared with the value of the work function at zero gate voltage obtained from ( [ eq024 ] ) for the largest coverage @xmath438 considered above , if we neglect the induced dipole , which is equal to @xmath439 ev .",
