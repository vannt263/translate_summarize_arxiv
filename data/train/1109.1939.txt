    "the classical algol - type binaries are composed of a b or a spectral - type main - sequence hotter primary star and an f or later - g giant or subgiant cooler secondary star .",
    "they are semi - detached interacting binary systems in which the evolved less massive secondary components have filled their corresponding roche lobes .",
    "therefore , the material on the less massive secondary star is transferring onto the hot main - sequence primaries .",
    "the classical algols are , in general , in a slow stage of mass transfer . the evolution of the semi - detached binaries is mostly interpreted in the framework of the roche model .",
    "a number of implicit assumptions are made for its application .",
    "these assumptions are ordered as follows : 1 ) the components are point masses , they are co - rotating with the orbital motion and 2 ) the most importantly the total mass and angular momentum are conserved",
    ". however , these restrictions are not so valid for the evolved binary systems .",
    "glazunova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) measured rotational velocities of the primary stars in the classical algols .",
    "at least seven systems out of 23 binaries rotate faster which differ from synchronize rotation by more than a factor of two .",
    "eggleton ( 2000 ) discussed evolution of algol type systems and concluded that they could not be evolved to their present status without having lost substantial mass and angular momentum.the fundamental parameters of well - observed detached and semi - detached algols are compiled and analysed by ibanolu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to reveal some possible implications for their nuclear and angular momentum evolution .",
    "they arrived at a result that the mass - ratio of detached algols is larger than unity .",
    "as the system evolved - off from the main - sequence mass transfer begins and the evolution will proceed towards lower mass ratios without considerable angular momentum loss ( aml ) . when the mass - ratio is reversed and became smaller than about 0.4 the orbital aml rate increases .",
    "it is also indicated that the classical algols are separated into two subclasses with respect to their orbital periods , i.e. p@xmath25 and p@xmath35 days .",
    "recently , derviolu et al . (",
    "2010 ) re - discussed spin angular momentum evolution of the long period algols .",
    "they have demonstrated that even a small amount of mass transfer , gainer immediately spin up to the critical rotational velocity . however , the observed rotational velocities of gainers are smaller than 40 per cent of the critical rate .",
    "they considered generation of magnetic fields in the radiative atmospheres in a differentially rotating star and proposed the possibility of mass and angular momentum loss driven by strong stellar winds in the intermediate - mass stars , similar to the primaries of the algols .",
    "the slow rotation of the primaries in the algol systems is explained by a balance between the spin - up by mass accretion and spin - down by stellar wind linked to a magnetic field .",
    "moreover , it is indicated that larger mass loss from the system is produced in the smaller magnetic fields .",
    "for the first time , parthasarathy et al .",
    "( 1983 ) called attention to the carbon deficiencies and nitrogen over - abundances in the atmospheres of secondary components of u cep and u sge .",
    "later on , cugier and hardorp ( 1988 ) indicated the carbon deficiencies in the iue - spectra of the gainers in @xmath4 per ( algol ) and @xmath0 tau .",
    "cugier ( 1989 ) expanded his study on the algols using the iue archival data and found similar results for six stars as in the case of algol and @xmath0 tau .",
    "tomkin and his collaborators ( tomkin , lambert and lemke 1993 ) observed eight algols in the optical wavelengths and compared the c abundances in the primaries with those at the single standard stars having nearly the same effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "they arrived at a result that the mass - gaining primaries of the semi - detached binaries have smaller c abundance with respect to the standard stars . on the other hand yoon and honeycutt ( 1992 ) measured c abundance for 12 algol secondaries using the strength of @xmath5-band of the ch molecule .",
    "the values of @xmath6 for the sample are smaller about 0.25 - 0.75 dex than those field g and k giants .    the distribution of c , n , o elements in the hydrogen - burning core of initially more massive component of an algol type system has been changed during the main - sequence evolution . in the case",
    "b evolution of the close binary systems the more massive star expands and fills its roche lobe as well as develops convection .",
    "convective mixing in the atmosphere may change the distribution of the c and n. however , carbon determinations for the primary and also for the secondary stars of algol - type binaries appear to be insufficient to arrive at a relevant quantitative analysis and tests for accretion and mixing . determinations of the carbon abundance for a large sample of algols may act as major constraints on the evolution models for these systems ( sarna and de greve 1996 , 1997 ) .    in this study ,",
    "the results of spectroscopic observations of some algols are presented . the equivalent width ( ew ) of c ii @xmath0 4267   line was measured for the 18 systems .",
    "the differences of ews between the algol primaries and the standard stars having similar effective temperatures were determined and compared with the orbital period increase and mass - transfer rates .",
    "we present the carbon deficiencies for the largest sample of algol - type mass - transferring systems and find , for the first time , that an evidence of a possible relationship between the carbon deficiency and mass transfer rate , at least for some systems which show orbital period increase .",
    "the chemical abundance determinations from equivalent width analysis for the mass - losing secondary stars in the semi - detached algol - type binaries could only be made during the totality , when the more massive primary star is completely eclipsed .",
    "out of the primary eclipse , the light contribution of the donors does not exceed a few per cent . during the primary eclipse",
    "the brightness of these systems are too low to be taken a spectrum in the totality , requiring a large telescope and an appropriate spectrograph .",
    "therefore we prefer to take spectrum of the gainers which are dominate in the spectra and have enough effective temperatures that the lines of ionized carbon and nitrogen can be formed . however , the primaries of the algols rotate fast enough that the blending affects the spectral lines .",
    "the gainers in the classical algols rotate at least five or more than that synchronous rotation . therefore a few lines of the carbon species can be measured .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out at two sites , namely , asiago and turkish national observatories .",
    "the targets were selected to the capability of the instruments . at the asiago observatory ( asi )",
    "the selected systems were observed with the reosc echelle spectrograph and ccd mounted at cassegrain focus of the 182 cm telescope .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength interval between 3900 and 7300  , divided into 27 orders . the average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and resolving power @xmath0/@xmath7 were about @xmath8 150 and 50000 , respectively .",
    "the observations were made between 10 and 20 march 2009 on successive nine nights . during this time interval 45 spectra of 14 algols and 3 spectra of the three standard stars",
    "were obtained .    in the spectroscopic observations at the turkish national observatory ( tug ) the coude echelle spectrometer ( ces ) attached to the 150 cm telescope was used .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 3700 - 10000    in 85 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath0/@xmath9 125000 at 4267    and an average signal - to - noise ratio was @xmath8150 .",
    "the observations were obtained on 28 and 29 may , 2010 . during two nights observations 7 spectra of five algols and 4 spectra of the three standard stars were obtained .",
    "the position of the grating was chosen so that the c ii @xmath0 4267   line was recorded simultaneously in the 9th and 10th orders with the h@xmath10 line .",
    "the ews can be measured only for the stars earlier than a0 spectral types . for the cooler",
    "stars it downs to 10 m  which is below our measuring limit .",
    "the echelle spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated by using a fe - ar lamp source with help of the iraf echelle package .",
    "the selected classical algol - type systems are presented in table 1 .",
    "the apparent visual magnitudes and spectral types were collected from the simbad data base and ibanolu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . since the ews of c species",
    "are depended on the effective temperature of the stars we observed some standard stars with the same instrumentation .",
    "the list of the standard stars and their properties are given in table 2 .",
    "since the c ii @xmath0 4267   line is produced only for the effective temperatures higher than 10 000 k , the standard stars were selected from the main - sequence stars with the effective temperatures between 10 000 and 30 000 k.        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the last two columns of table 6 the rates of the orbital change and mass transfer are given .",
    "while the highest mass transfer rate is found for u cep , the smallest mass transfer rate is obtained for the system u her .",
    "the ews of @xmath04267   c ii line in the 10 stars are plotted versus the orbital period changes and mass transfer rates in fig.3 , in logarithmic scale .",
    "the ews for the systems u her and @xmath4 per are adopted from tomkin , lambert and lemke ( 1993 ) .",
    "it seems that there is a linear relationship between these two quantities . as the rate of mass transfer increases the ew of @xmath04267   c ii line decreases .",
    "de greve ( 1993 ) suggests that only a fraction of the mass lost by the less massive companion is captured by the more massive primary star . as the orbital periods longer the matter captured by the primary decreases .",
    "the accreted material will be low during the fast phase of mass transfer , therefore the abundances of the gainer will not be influenced .",
    "the algols studied here are in the phase of slow mass transfer . in this phase",
    "most of the material is captured by the primary star , therefore slow mass transfer can modify the atmosphere of the gainer . since the transferring material contains lower c and mixing within the original material the abundance of c appears to decrease ( sarna and de greve , 1997 ) .",
    "fig.3 shows a correlation between the orbital period change and ews of cii @xmath04267   line of ten algol - type interacting binary systems . despite limited number of samples",
    ", there seems to be a correlation between the rates of orbital period increase and mass transfer and carbon abundance in the surface layers of the primary stars .",
    "as the rate of mass transfer increases the ew of c ii line decreases .          as a point of single star evolution ,",
    "stars that are massive than 1.4 fuse their hydrogen to helium by cno - bicycle mechanism ( sarna and de greve , 1997 ) . as a net result of this process , while the the amount of carbon is reduced the nitrogen abundance is increased .",
    "owing to nature of cno cycle that occurs in the high - intermediate stars , the size of the reduced carbon regions reach approximately half of the star s mass due to the core convection at the end of main sequence . in figure 4 , we calculated the ratio of mass fraction of the carbon at the centre to the surface for zero - age main - sequence ( zams , open circles ) and for terminal - age main - sequence ( tams , solid circles ) by using twin stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 ) for a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "it is also known that the components of the binary stars spend their life as a single star until the originally more massive stars fill their corresponding roche lobes . following this stage of evolution",
    "the primary stars transfer their mass at least up to initial mass ratio is reversed .",
    "the amount of material lost from losers slightly depends on whether the total am is conserved ( derviolu , 2010 ) . as a result",
    ", the cno processed material unavoidably is accreted onto the surface of gainers , originally less massive secondary stars .",
    "the amount of carbon reduced material on the surface of the today s primaries are expected as shown in fig.4 , where the ratios of c abundance as a mass of per gram matter in the core to the surface are plotted for the zams and tams models . as it is clearly seen in figure 4 , the ratio of carbon at the core to the surface increases with increasing mass .",
    "the ratio of c / n in the surface of primaries may give us some hints about the initial mass of the donor stars when fusing its hydrogen fuel .",
    "therefore one may guess about the mass loss and accreted matter during the evolution of a close binary system .",
    "we have determined c abundance in the atmospheres of the primary stars of the 18 algol - type systems . for determination of the c abundance we used the ews of c ii @xmath0 4267   doublet .",
    "a comparison of the c ii @xmath0 4267   line with those of the standard stars , having the same effective temperature and luminosity class , clearly indicates that the gainers have significantly smaller ews .",
    "the observed c abundances imply that the surface layers of the gainers have been altered by the accreted material which contains lower abundance of carbon than that in the atmosphere of this star .",
    "a plot of the ews of c ii @xmath0 4267   line versus the mass transfer rates for ten stars points out an existence of a relationship between these quantities .",
    "the higher mass transfer rate corresponds to the smaller ews .",
    "this may be taken as mixing on the surface layers of the accreted star which leads to lower c and higher n abundance ( de greve and cugier , 1989 ) .",
    "logarithmic abundances relative to the standard stars and the sun clearly confirm this expectation .",
    "average @xmath1 $ ] are estimated to be -0.82 and -0.54 relative to the sun and the standard stars , respectively .",
    "specially , abundance ratios will give us important information about evolutionary histories and current status of the interacting algols .",
    "however , it should be noted that measuring the isotopic ratios in the mass - losing secondaries is difficult due to their faintness , contributing a few per cent to the total light .",
    "the authors acknowledge generous allotments of observing time at asiago observatory ( italy ) and tubitak national observatory ( tug ) of turkey . we also wish to thank the turkish scientific and technical research council for supporting this work through grant no .",
