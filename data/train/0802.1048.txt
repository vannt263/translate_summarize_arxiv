    "the discovery of new particle phenomena has led to some of the greatest advances in our understanding of particle physics , particularly when the discovery is unexpected . among the most famous",
    "are the muon ( 1937 ) , strange mesons ( `` v '' particles , 1947 ) , the @xmath1 meson ( 1974 ) , and the tau lepton ( 1974 ) .",
    "there is broad agreement among particle physicists that progress in understanding some fundamental questions , such as the origin of mass , requires new physics .",
    "while there are many interesting theories of possible new physics , a few of which we shall touch upon in this review , no one actually knows what nature has in store for us .",
    "therefore , it is imperative that modern particle physics experiments search for signs of new physics in as many different ways as possible , including those that are motivated by current theory and those that are not .",
    "numerous searches for new particle phenomena have been done using data from the tevatron , the fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fermilab ) hadron collider .",
    "most of these searches focus on reconstructing particles that decay within millimeters of the beamline or on observing missing transverse energy signatures from stable particles that escape without interacting .",
    "however , as is shown in this review , the multipurpose design of the tevatron detectors , d0 and cdf , allows a broader range of searches to be conducted , namely for long - lived , but unstable particles .",
    "many possibilities exist that give rise to unique signatures .",
    "a wide variety of theoretical models , including large classes based on supersymmetry ( susy ) , allow for long - lived particles .",
    "the simplest susy variation is @xmath2-parity violation which allows the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) to decay purely to non - susy particles.@xcite the rate of such decays is generally determined by one or more couplings .",
    "numerous searches at both the lep and tevatron colliders have looked for ( nearly ) prompt @xmath2-parity violating processes , however they are insensitive to longer lifetimes where the coupling is small.@xcite    gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models , in which the supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gauge fields other than gravity , generally have a light ( mev ) gravitino lsp and all other supersymmetric particles decay via cascades to the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "the coupling to gravity can determine how quickly the nlsp decays to its non - susy partner and the gravitino .",
    "if the symmetry breaking scale is small ( larger coupling ) , the lifetime is short .",
    "conversely , if the scale is large , this results in a long - lived nlsp that can decay either within the detector or beyond it.@xcite favored nlsp candidates include the neutralino ( ) or the stau ( ) .",
    "long lifetimes can also arise from small mass splittings between the nlsp and the lsp.@xcite if the mass difference ( @xmath3 ) is small enough , phase space suppression will impede the decay of the nlsp .",
    "one particular model of interest here is inspired by anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) with a chargino nlsp and a mass splitting @xmath4 150 mev .",
    "split supersymmetry , where susy scalars are much heavier than susy fermions , can suppress the decay rate of gluinos giving them long lifetimes.@xcite they may live long enough to hadronize into ",
    "r - hadrons , \" colorless , bound states of the gluino , quarks , and gluons.@xcite nuclear interactions can cause some neutral r - hadrons to become charged , leading to a number of interesting signatures within the detector.@xcite    there has been recent discussions of a class of models referred to as `` hidden valley '' models which can yield new phenomena resulting in long - lived particles through reduced coupling to standard model ( sm ) particles.@xcite the hidden valley structures are very general and can be added to many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) theories .",
    "most interestingly , they can give rise to significantly different phenomenology from that commonly associated with the original bsm model.@xcite an example is a light higgs boson that decays to two neutral , long - lived particles that further decay to @xmath5-jets.@xcite these `` hidden valley '' models provide a timely cautionary tale : if one only looks where the light shines brightest , one risks missing a possible spectacular prize in the shadows .",
    "the nutev experiment at fermilab observed an unexpected excess of events in one of three searches for long - lived neutral particles.@xcite the nutev neutrino detector was augmented with a 30 m long , low - mass decay region in front .",
    "the decay region was instrumented with several drift chambers along its length .",
    "a weakly - interacting , long - lived neutral particle produced by proton - nucleon interactions from the 800 gev tevatron beam could travel 1.4 km and decay in the low mass region .",
    "nutev performed three separate searches ( in mass bins ) by reconstructing a vertex from a pair of tracks from hits in the decay region and using particle identification from the neutrino detector . in the high mass ( 2.2 - 15 gev ) search ,",
    "three events were reconstructed with a vertex from two muons and an unobserved neutrino .",
    "the largest backgrounds originate from neutrino scattering within the decay region and in the upstream shielding .",
    "the total estimated background was 0.07 @xmath6 0.01 events , which is to be compared with three observed events .",
    "no widely accepted explanation of this excess has been found .",
    "no backgrounds are large enough to explain it .",
    "cross - checks performed with events of similar topology within the neutrino detector support the hypothesis that the events are unlikely to be due to neutrino scattering . if a new particle is responsible , the three events are consistent with a particle of @xmath75 gev mass decaying to @xmath8 .",
    "the best theoretical hypothesis for a new particle is a long - lived neutralino from @xmath9 mesons produced at the primary proton target.@xcite unfortunately , no current experiment matches nutev s running conditions so it has been impossible to repeat the same search .",
    "however , as detailed below , collider experiments could , in principle , observe such a hypothetical particle , depending on the production mechanism .      while the specific detectors differ in technology and implementation , the cdf@xcite and d0@xcite detectors share similar general characteristics .",
    "the overall structure ( from inside outward ) consists of a central tracking region , a calorimeter , and a muon system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] for a generic schematic ) .",
    "the central tracking system consists of a silicon tracking detector surrounded by another large volume tracker within a solenoid magnet .",
    "the silicon tracker provides precision vertex measurement as well as identification of heavy quarks using secondary vertices .",
    "the outer tracker , with its large lever arm , measures the transverse momenta of charged tracks .",
    "table  [ tab : detectors ] lists some of the specific characteristics of the individual detectors .",
    "collider detectors are optimized to reconstruct particles that decay within millimeters of the beamline ( including bottom or charm quarks ) or to detect stable particles that escape without interacting ( e.g. neutrinos ) through the measurement of missing transverse energy .",
    "however , they can also be used to search for particles that decay with long lifetimes .",
    "below we review several analyses that use techniques including detached vertex reconstruction , timing , and unique signatures to search for such particles .",
    "d0 has carried out a search for neutral particles that have a ( relatively ) long lifetime and decay to two muons plus missing transverse energy.@xcite one of the motivations for this search was to explore what the tevatron collider can say about the nutev result described in sec .",
    "[ sec : nutev ] .",
    "the signature was a highly displaced vertex reconstructed using tracks in the central fiber tracker ( cft ) , which are matched to signals in the muon system .",
    "the neutral particle must travel at least 5 - 20 cm in the transverse plane before decaying .",
    "these decay lengths are significantly longer than those of normal @xmath5-hadrons",
    ". studies of @xmath10 decays demonstrated the ability to find these highly displaced vertices .",
    "events with two isolated muons with @xmath11 10 gev were selected .",
    "the muons were required to have a distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary interaction vertex ( pv ) of greater than 0.01(0.1 ) cm in the x - y plane ( along the @xmath12 axis ) .",
    "this reduces events where the muons originate from the pv .",
    "the muon tracks were fit to a common vertex and its distance in the transverse dimension ( i.e. the radius ) was calculated from @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the @xmath15 and @xmath16 coordinates of the primary vertex .",
    "the final event selection requires @xmath17 cm .",
    "there are no sm sources of highly displaced vertices involving muon pairs , so the largest backgrounds originate from mis - reconstruction .",
    "such instrumental backgrounds are typically difficult to model accurately , therefore , d0 estimated the background from data that closely ( but not exactly ) resemble those in the final selection .",
    "events with @xmath18 cm and/or only one muon passing the dca requirement were used .",
    "the total background was estimated to be @xmath19 events .",
    "no events were found to pass all of the selection criteria in data , therefore , limits on the production cross section times branching ratios were set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d0nllplimits ] ) .",
    "the limit depends on the lifetime and the mass ( through the acceptance ) .",
    "a comparison was made with limits set by nutev as well as with what one would expect if the nutev excess is interpreted as a signal .",
    "to do so , the nutev limit was converted from that of @xmath20 interactions at @xmath21 = 38 gev to one for @xmath0 interactions at @xmath21 = 1960 gev using a model of neutralino pair production in an unconstrained minimal supersymmetric model ( umssm).@xcite as a result , d0 can exclude some interpretations of the nutev result at all lifetimes .",

    "cdf performed a search for a heavy , long - lived particle decaying to a photon and an unobserved particle.@xcite a heavy particle produced at the tevatron would move slowly away from the interaction point . if the particle is unstable , yet long - lived , its decay products would be delayed in reaching the various detectors relative to those from prompt decays.@xcite cdf implemented measurement of the timing of particles arriving at its electromagnetic calorimeter with a timing resolution of 0.6 ns.@xcite    the timing measurement formed the basis of a search for delayed photons from decays of massive particles . while the search is model independent , the prototypical gmsb signal @xmath22 , with a @xmath23 lifetime of 5 ns was used to estimate a typical acceptance for such events .",

    "figure  [ fig : cdfgammatime ] shows distributions of the corrected arrival time for each background , the data , and for a sample signal .",
    "all background normalizations were determined by fitting data in regions of @xmath26 outside of the signal region .",
    "signal acceptance was estimated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "after optimization of several selection criteria , background was estimated to be 1.25 @xmath6 0.66 events ( 0.71 @xmath6 0.60 from sm , 0.46 @xmath6 0.26 from cosmics , 0.07 @xmath6 0.05 from beam halo ) .",

    "[ sec : theoryintro ] , split supersymmetry provides a plausible candidate . in one scenario ,",
    "charged r - hadrons lose energy via ionization and some fraction can stop within the calorimeter ( called stopped gluinos ) . at some later time the gluino can decay to a gluon and a neutralino ( @xmath34 ) or a quark - antiquark and a neutralino ( @xmath35 ) giving a large energy deposition in the calorimeter that is not associated ( in time ) with the interaction that produced it .    for such events ,",
