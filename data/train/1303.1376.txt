    "diffractionless optical beam steering is of great interest in optical imaging , laser machining and optical communication .",
    "a gradient of the refractive index provides the simplest way to steer the optical beam .",
    "such a refractive index gradient can be achieved by various physical mechanisms such as thermal gradients @xcite , acousto - optic interactions @xcite and electro - optic effects @xcite .",
    "similarly , light - matter interactions can be used to control the optical beam propagation through the atomic medium .",
    "more precisely , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite can provide beam - steering since refractive index changes significantly near the center of the transparency window @xcite .",
    "crucial obstacles in the above schemes are absorption and diffraction .",
    "the effect of diffraction is inevitable as an optical beam propagates through a medium .",
    "an optical beam can be considered as a superposition of plane waves with different wave vectors .",
    "diffraction arises , as each plane wave acquires a different phase during its propagation .",
    "in free space , a light beam will typically be distorted severely already after propagation over few rayleigh lengths  @xcite .",
    "for all - optical processing , this remains as a major obstacle in practical applications . in order to suppress or even eliminate diffraction ,",
    "researchers have developed many proposals based on different physical mechanisms , such as eit  @xcite , coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite , coherent raman processes  @xcite , or saturated absorption  @xcite .",
    "most of the schemes employ suitable spatially - dependent structures of the control field to prevent the optical beam from diffracting .",
    "recently , it was found that alternatively dicke narrowing induced by atomic thermal motion and velocity - changing collisions can be useful to eliminate the diffraction of a probe beam that carries an arbitrary image  @xcite .    a particular class of beam steering devices",
    "are so - called y - branch waveguides , in which a single waveguide splits into two output ports  @xcite .",
    "y - branch waveguides can be used to divide a single beam into two separate branches with a certain intensity ratio .",
    "a desirable feature of such devices is a dynamical control of the light beam intensity at the different branches .",
    "motivated by this , here we propose a scheme for all - optical beam steering in optically written waveguides .",
    "we facilitate a five - level medium driven by spatially dependent control fields , which was recently proposed as a method to achieve large refractive index modulations with low absorption  @xcite .",
    "we start by analyzing the light propagation through a single optically written waveguide . comparing results obtained using a split - operator method assuming paraxial approximation to those from a finite - difference - time domain approach beyond paraxial approximation , we find that already in this simple case the paraxial approximation usually assumed in related studies does not provide an accurate description of the beam dynamics .",
    "next , we consider an optically written branched waveguide structure consisting of two parallel beams crossed by a third tilted beam .",
    "this structure essentially consists of two coupled y - branched waveguides .",
    "we find that the tilted beam can be used to switch the light propagation between either of the two output ports formed by the two parallel light beams .",
    "our numerical results show that the coupling efficiency of the probe beam into the different branches can be controlled by changing the width and the angle of the tilted gaussian control field , and the transmission of the output probe beam can be improved by increasing the amplitude of an additionally applied incoherent pump field .",

    "the waveguide structure is prepared in a medium tailored with coherent control fields and an incoherent pump field .",
    "a spatially dependent gaussian control field is applied to create a waveguide - like spatial refractive index variation within the medium , such that a probe beam can propagate within the waveguide structure essentially without diffraction .",
    "our initial calculations show that already in a single optically written waveguide , accurate results for the beam propagation can not be obtained within the paraxial approximation . to analyze the propagation dynamics",
    ", we therefore numerically integrate the corresponding equations without paraxial approximation for the probe fields .    as our main result",
    ", we have demonstrated that a controllable branched - waveguide structure can be optically formed inside the medium by applying a spatially dependent control field consisting of two parallel and one tilted gaussian beams .",
    "the tilted beam can be used to selectively steer a probe beam between two different output ports . in the overlapping regions of the gaussian control",
    "beams a rapidly varying refractive index is created that guides the probe beam to propagate in a particular output branch . increasing the amplitude of the incoherent pump beam can be used to reduce the absorption of the medium .",
