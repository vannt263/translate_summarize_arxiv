    "1996 , chyzy et al . 2007 ) and including our data ( excluding the 1280 mhz point ) resulted in the best fit spectrum with an index of @xmath47 ( see fig [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "the best fit which has @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "this spectrum gives a lower @xmath54 compared to the single power law fit ( also in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and hence , we believe , is a better fit to the observed data between 240 mhz and 10 ghz .",
    "however the fit fails to constrain the break frequency since we do not have data points below 240 mhz . from the above",
    ", it is reasonable to conclude that the integrated spectrum of ngc 4254 has a break at lower frequencies which is typical of spiral galaxies ( pohl et al .",
    "1991 , hummel 1991 ) .",
    "we also note that lower frequency data ( @xmath55 mhz ) are required to confirm the break .",
    "a spectral index map of ngc 4254 was constructed between 240 and 610 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "images at both the frequencies were made with a maximum baseline of 15 k@xmath35 and then convolved to an angular resolution of @xmath56 at a position angle of @xmath57 .",
    "a cutoff of @xmath58 was used for both the images . while the spectral index across the disk is typically between @xmath59 and @xmath60 with few regions showing @xmath61 , the emission outside the optical disk typically has a spectral index steeper than @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the spectral index of the envelope is reminiscent of the halo emission in edge - on galaxies .",
    "chyzy et al ( 2006,2007 ) report the detection of a sharp bright magnetized ridge at 1.43 ghz in the south and present their image at 4.8 ghz .",
    "they do not detect the southern feature at 4.8 ghz which implies a spectral index steeper than @xmath63 when combined with our 240 mhz data .",
    "this is consistent with our data at 610 mhz .",
    "the spectral index near the centre of the galaxy is comparable to the disk ruling out the presence of an agn at the centre .    from the above discussion",
    ", we conclude that there are two components to the radio continuum emission from ngc 4254 , namely the intense disk component which has @xmath64 and the extended component which has @xmath65 .",
    "the two components are difficult to distinguish morphologically .",
    "the radio power at 1.4 ghz of most normal spiral galaxies lie between @xmath66 watts - hz@xmath3 and @xmath67 watts - hz@xmath3 ( hummel 1981 ) and absolute blue magnitudes lie between @xmath68 to @xmath69 ( hummel 1981 ) .",

    "( 1990 ) suggested that the sharp cutoff in hi in the south - east could be due to compression by the icm which could then explain the bright disk .",
    "simulations by vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that ram pressure needs to be invoked to explain the observed hi morphology .",
    "more recently , chyzy et al . (",
    "2006,2007 ) have detected a large polarized envelope of emission at 1.43 ghz around the optical disk and also a bright ridge of polarised emission in the south which they suggest is due to field compression by ram pressure .",
    "this , they suggest , could be enhanced by the non - disk hi clouds detected by phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) falling back on the disk .",
    "all the above indicate that ram pressure due to interstellar medium ( ism)-icm interaction is active in this system .",
    "on the other hand , ample evidence that this galaxy was involved in a tidal encounter has been found - the single dominant spiral arm , the presence of non - disk hi clouds ( phookun et al . 1993 ) and the presence of a large hi tail which extends northwards from ngc 4254 to a distance of 250 kpc ( haynes et al .",

    "the x - ray emission detected from this galaxy ( chyzy et al .",
    "2007 , soria & wong 2006 ) is confined to the optical disk .",
    "this indicates the absence of hot gas around ngc 4254 which is as expected since it is located on the periphery of the virgo cluster at a projected distance of 1.2 mpc from m87 .",
    "soria & wong ( 2006 ) suggest that the ultraluminous x - ray ( ulx ) source they detect due south of the optical disk of ngc 4254 has been triggered by the impact of the infalling hi cloud ( phookun et al .",
    "1993 ) on the disk .",
    "edge - on galaxies commonly show the presence of halo emission extending along the minor axis which is widely studied at low radio frequencies owing to their steep spectra .",
    "we examined the dss maps of a few low inclination galaxies ( e.g. ngc 5236 , ngc 2997 , ngc 6946 ) taken from the atlas by condon et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and find that the radio and optical disks have similar extents .",
    "hence we find the radio continunum envelope detected around ngc 4254 interesting and in this section we try to understand the origin of the extended component ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we believe one of the following scenarios can account for this extended radio continuum component .",
    "if we examine fig [ fig3]b closely , it appears that the radio emission extends further along the spiral arms of the galaxy especially in the north - west and south - east .",
    "thus , one possibility is that the spiral arms extend further out in the radio than in the optical .",
    "we examine the plausibility of this as follows",
    ". the typical synchrotron lifetimes of relativistic electrons diffusing out from supernovae in the galaxy would be @xmath74 years at 240 mhz if the magnetic field was 3 @xmath75 g . since we observe radio continuum emission from the envelope",
    ", this suggests that the relativistic electron population was generated less than @xmath74 years ago .",
    "if this was the case , then at least the low mass stars ( lifetimes @xmath76 years ) from the progenitor stellar population should be surviving even if the ob associations have disappeared ( lifetimes @xmath77 years ) during the synchrotron lifetime of the electrons .",
    "however no optical emission in the dss r band is observed to be coincident with the extended features .",
    "we also examined the nir emission in the j , h and k bands from the 2mass maps which trace emission from low mass stars .",
    "the nir morphology of the galaxy is similar to the dss optical and no emission coincident with the extended features is detected .",
    "this indicates that the extended features are unlikely to be extensions of the galactic spiral arms but are a result of some other physical processes .",
    "the extended emission could be from the magnetized electron gas which has been removed from the disk due to external influences like tidal , ram pressure or turbulent viscous stripping .",
    "this would lead to the icm being enriched in magnetic field and matter .",
    "our multi - frequency radio study of ngc 4254 gives interesting results .",
    "we detect radio continuum emission from regions surrounding the optical disk ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of this emission is steeper ( @xmath65 ) compared to the disk emission ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "moreover , the extended emission does not form a uniform halo around the optical disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "while it could be partially attributed to sensitivity and spatial frequency coverage , most of this feature indicates real asymmetry in the extended emission . at 240 mhz ,",
    "about 15% of the total emission arises in this extended component . in our hi velocity map ,",
    "we notice a lagging rotation field in the atomic gas located to the north of the galaxy .",
    "it is likely that this part is being stripped and the gas is slowly losing rotation .    from the above",
    ", we suggest that the extended radio continuum emission which has a steeper spectral index and the atomic gas in the north of the galaxy are likely not part of the disk emission and probably do not lie in the plane of ngc 4254",
    ". this might be gas which has been pushed out of the galaxy by ism - icm interaction .",
    "below we summarize the morphological features that we believe can be explained by ram pressure caused by the ism - icm interaction :    * a sharp cutoff is present in both the radio continuum and hi to the south / south - east .",
    "the galaxy is ploughing into the icm at an angle of @xmath27 ( vollmer et al .",
    "2005 ) which is close to face - on and the south is the leading edge encountering the icm wind .",
    "the swept - up gas would , thus , give rise to such a smooth boundary . * the enhanced star formation rates across the entire galaxy .",
    "the wind encounters the entire disk and hence star formation would have been triggered throughout the disk explaining the enhanced star formation rates ( @xmath73yr@xmath3 , soria & wong 2006 ) * intense radio emission .",
    "this would be a direct result of enhanced star formation and presence of young massive stars in this galaxy .",
    "* extended radio continuum around the optical disk .",
    "this emission is from the relativistic electron gas which has been influenced by ram pressure and which is subsequently diffusing beyond the galaxy as the latter rushes towards the cluster centre ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) through the icm .",
    "the extended emission arises in gas which is not co - planar with the disk of the galaxy but follows the galaxy .",
    "the hi tully - fisher relation gives a distance of 16.8 mpc to ngc 4254 ( schoniger & sofue 1997 ) whereas the mean distance to the virgo cluster is @xmath78 mpc ( federspiel et al .",
    "thus , ngc 4254 is closer to us compared to m87 and hence it is reasonable to consider it to be receding and falling in towards the centre of the cluster .",
    "the matter giving rise to the extended radio continuum , then , lies between us and the galaxy .",
    "* steep spectrum of the extended continuum .",
    "the extended emission is similar to the halo emission observed in edge - on disk galaxies which is also found to have a steeper spectrum compared to disk emission .",
    "we believe a similar explanation holds for the emission around ngc 4254 .",
    "* extended polarized envelope at 1.4 ghz detected around the optical disk by chyzy et al .",
    "( 2006,2007 ) .",
    "* minor hi deficiency of 0.17 quoted by cayatte et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "based on the above , we believe that the extended radio continuum emission detected outside the optical disk is mainly because of a ram pressure event as the galaxy moves in the icm .",
    "the point we would like to stress is that ram pressure is effective even though the galaxy is located in the low icm density environs in the outskirts of the virgo cluster .    using equipartition and minimum energy arguments",
    ", we find that the equipartition magnetic field in ngc 4254 is about 3@xmath75 g and the magnetic pressure is @xmath79 ergs-@xmath80 .",
    "the ram pressure acting on the galaxy , which lies about @xmath81 from the centre of the cluster was estimated to be @xmath82 ergs-@xmath80 ( cayatte et al . 1994 ) .",
    "they estimate the gravitational pull for this galaxy to be @xmath83 ergs-@xmath80 .",
    "thus , the ram pressure acting on the galaxy leading to gas stripping is slightly larger than the magnetic pressure holding back the relativistic electrons from escaping and about half of the gravitational pressure of the galaxy .",
    "since this galaxy has undergone a tidal encounter , the tidal debris could increase the icm densities or the tidal interaction could have reduced the surface density of gas in the outer parts of the galaxy leading to an enhancement in the ability of ram pressure to influence the ism of ngc 4254 .",
    "similar mechanism has been suggested for other virgo galaxies ( e.g. vollmer 2003 , chung et al .",
    "2007 ) and poor groups ( e.g. kantharia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover the high star formation rate of the galaxy would lead to intense stellar winds and supernova explosions which would further facilitate the ism - icm interaction .",
    "thus , we believe that our radio observations support the earlier results of vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and chyzy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where both tidal interactions and ram pressure were put forward to explain the observed morphology of the hi and the radio continuum at 1.4 and 4.8 ghz of ngc 4254 .",
    "we also suggest a possible way to determine whether a low inclination galaxy has undergone a ram pressure event by examining its low radio frequency morphology and the distribution of the spectral index across it .",
    "several authors have studied ram pressure stripping in a variety of environs and with a variety of initial conditions in clusters and groups ( e.g. schulz & struck 2001 , vollmer 2001 , roediger & hensler 2005 , roediger & bruggen 2006 , hester 2006 ) .",
    "we examine these in light of our new low frequency radio observations of ngc 4254 .",
    "the angle between the disk of ngc 4254 and its orbital plane in virgo cluster is @xmath27 ( vollmer et al .",
    "2005 ) and the stripping is close to , but not entirely , face - on as the galaxy moves within the cluster .",
    "roediger & bruggen ( 2006 ) , in their simulations of ram pressure stripping in disk galaxies , have shown that for face - on stripping , the stripped gas will expand and form a tail behind the galaxy .",
    "for a low inclination galaxy , the stripped gas will form a halo around it over a few hundred million years and would be detectable depending on its emissivity .",
    "vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed simulations to explain the observed hi morphology ( phookun et al .",
    "1993 ) of ngc 4254 .",
    "they could explain most of the morphological features only if ram pressure is invoked alongwith a tidal encounter which would have occurred about 300 myrs ago .",
    "their results indicated that ram pressure would only succceed in distorting gas with hydrogen column densities @xmath84 @xmath24 .",
    "roediger & hensler ( 2005 ) and roediger & bruggen ( 2006 ) , from their simulations on the influence of the icm on the cluster members , infer that galaxies undergo ram pressure stripping in three stages .",
    "the first stage , they describe as the instantaneous stripping phase wherein the outer gas disk expands without becoming unbound from the galaxy .",
    "it can lead to truncation of the gas disk without much mass loss .",
    "this phase is likely to affect galaxies on the outskirts of clusters and in groups and is short - lived , lasting only for 20 to 200 myr . in the intermediate , much longer - lived phase , some of the expanded gas actually evaporates while some of it falls back on the disk . in the final third phase , the galaxy loses mass at a stable rate of 1 m@xmath85yr@xmath3 due to turbulent viscous stripping ( nulsen 1982 ) .    comparing this simulation result with our radio continuum data on ngc 4254 , it appears that gas stripping in ngc 4254 is in the first phase of evolution .",
    "the extended features which surround the optical disk of ngc 4254 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) are probably due to the relativistic gas which has diffused out from the disk but has not yet evaporated .",
    "the same argument also probably holds for the hi gas .",
    "the gas is being stripped as seen from the jagged morphology of hi that we detect especially in the north and along the vertical edge in the east .",
    "the smooth boundary to the south is the leading edge and is caused by the wind blowing across it .",
    "some of the gas in the north which shows a lagging rotation field might be due to stripped gas which is slowly losing rotation .",
    "we also tried to understand the non - disk hi clouds that phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have detected surrounding the galaxy and not following galaxy rotation .",
    "phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) conclude that these clouds form an infalling population . while the tidal origin put forward by phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is the most plausible especially since these form part of the long hi tail which haynes et al . ( 2007 ) attribute to galaxy harrassment , we examined it in relation to the three stages of ram pressure stripping inferred by roediger & hensler ( 2005 ) and explained in brief above .",
    "if we hypothesize that the infalling clouds were stripped from the galaxy due to ram pressure then the hi gas in this galaxy might have just entered into the second phase of evolution ( roediger & hensler 2005 ) . in this phase ,",
    "part of the hi falls back whereas part of the gas is lost from the system .",
    "some of the far non - disk hi clouds that phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) detect could also possibly be part of this population .",
    "since the galaxy is receding towards south / south - east , the tail of clouds extending northwards appears to be in the expected direction .",
    "however , we also note that roediger & bruggen ( 2006 ) demonstrate in their simulations that the direction of motion of the galaxy can not always be surmised from the tail of stripped gas .",
    "it may be mentioned , however , that our explanation of the infalling clouds ( phookun et al .",
    "1993 ) is more speculative and requires further evidence from simulations .",
    "since ngc 4254 is located in a relatively low density environment in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , the ram pressure stripping event is relatively young and was begun at most 200 myrs ago ( roediger & hensler 2005 ) . recall that the simulation by vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) indicated that a tidal interaction involving ngc 4254 occurred @xmath86 myrs ago .",
    "these timescales support the hypothesis that the tidal encounter boosted the potential of ism - icm interaction making it more effective then it would have otherwise been .",
    "the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] summarizes the scenario for ngc 4254 as discussed above .",
    "in this paper , we have presented multifrequency radio continuum observations made with the gmrt of the spiral galaxy ngc 4254 located in the north - west outskirts of the virgo cluster .",
    "ngc 4254 is a luminous galaxy with a radio power of @xmath2 watts - hz@xmath3 at 240 mhz .",
    "we report the detection of extended , structured , low surface brightness radio continuum emission at 240 mhz surrounding the optical disk .",
    "we note that chyzy et al .",
    "( 2006,2007 ) have reported detection of an extended polarized envelope around the optical disk at 1.4 ghz .    combining our data with existing spectral data ( soida et al .",
    "1996 , chyzy et al .",
    "2007 ) , we find that the best fit to the global spectrum is given by a spectral index of @xmath47 which is close to the value soida et al .",
    "( 1996 ) quote .",
    "however from our data at 240 , 325 and 610 mhz , we deduce that the spectrum flattens at the lower frequencies . a heuristic model which includes electron propogation effects ( hummel 1991 ) gives a better fit to the data .",
    "the injection spectrum has an index @xmath4 .    from a detailed spectral index mapping between 240 and 610 mhz , we find that the spectral index of the extended emission is steeper with @xmath65 compared to that of the radio emission coincident with the optical disk ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we hypothesize that the extended emission is not associated with the optical disk but has been pushed out due to ram pressure of the icm acting on the ism of the galaxy .",
    "the atomic material in the north lags in rotation wrt rest of the disk and this we believe is part of the gas mass which is being influenced by ram pressure . ngc",
    "4254 is moving away from us and the stripped material lies between us and the galaxy as shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    from the above , we conclude the following :    * we believe that we have detected a clear signature of ram pressure stripping in ngc 4254 , a spiral galaxy in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , in the form of an extended envelope of emission surrounding the optical disk at 240 mhz .",
    "this emission exhibits a steep spectral index as compared to the disk emission .",
    "we suggest that these might be common signatures of ism - icm interaction which have not been noticed due to a dearth of such low frequency high sensitivity data on low inclination galaxies in cluster / group environments . *",
    "we suggest that low frequency ( @xmath87 mhz ) high sensitivity survey of a sample of face - on galaxies in low density groups and clusters will help generate significant information on the radio frequency signatures of ism - icm interactions .",
    "signatures such as a steep spectrum and extended emission around low inclination galaxies can be studied for a larger sample .",
    "* ism - icm interactions are likely to be more common in lower density , lower velocity dispersion environments than is presently believed .",

    "2001 , kantharia et al .",
    "2005 , levy et al .",
    "2007 ) which suggest that ram pressure events are active in x - ray poor groups and in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "simulations by several groups ( e.g. roediger & bruggen 2006 , vollmer et al .",
    "2005 , hester 2006 ) show that this is possible .",
