    "the formation mechanism of massive stars is a topic of active research .",
    "because massive star formation regions typically lie at distances of several kiloparsecs , the identification of high mass protostars requires both good sensitivity and high angular resolution . as a consequence of their presumed youth ,",
    "ultracompact hii regions ( uc  regions ) provide a good tracer of current massive star formation @xcite and may be expected to be accompanied by protostars in earlier evolutionary stages .",
    "indeed , recent high - resolution millimeterwave images of uc  regions have revealed the high - mass equivalent of `` class  0 '' protostars .",
    "examples include the young stellar object iras  23385 + 6053 @xcite , the compact methyl cyanide core near the g31.41 + 0.31 uc@xcite , the proto - b - star g34.24 + 0.14 mm @xcite , the g9.62 + 0.19-f hot core @xcite , and the protocluster g24.78 + 0.08 @xcite .",
    "to identify these deeply - embedded objects requires an optically thin tracer in order to probe through the large extinction toward the giant molecular cloud cores that harbor them .",
    "submillimeter continuum emission from cool dust is a good tracer of protostars because it remains optically thin at high column densities ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , spectral line emission from c@xmath3o  is a good optically thin tracer that can reveal areas of high molecular gas column density .    our target in this study ,",
    "iras  18317@xmath00757 , is a luminous infrared source ( log l@xmath6 ) at a kinematic distance of 4.9 kpc ( @xmath7 = 80 km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "based on its iras colors , it has been identified as a massive protostellar candidate @xcite .",
    "previous single - dish radio frequency studies of this region have revealed hydrogen recombination line emission @xcite and water maser emission @xcite .",
    "the centimeterwave continuum emission shows both extended components ( up to @xmath9 ) @xcite and a uc  region @xcite .",
    "the region has been detected in various dense gas tracers including the nh@xmath10(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) transitions @xcite and cs(7 - 6 ) @xcite , though it was not detected in a methyl cyanide search @xcite , nor in a 6  ghz hydroxl maser search @xcite , nor in two 6.7  ghz methanol maser searches @xcite .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) line shows a complex profile which has prevented the identification of high - velocity outflow emission in large - beam ( @xmath11 ) surveys @xcite .",
    "also known as afgl2194 , compact infrared emission was first detected from the ground in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 bands by @xcite and later by @xcite .",
    "airborne observations of far - infrared continuum and fine - structure lines ( s , o , n , and ne ) yield an electron density of 3500  @xmath15 for the uc  region and indicate a stellar type of o9 to early b @xcite .",
    "complete infrared spectra ( @xmath16 m ) have been recorded by the iso sws and lws spectrometers @xcite . at higher angular resolution ,",
    "the region has been independently observed as part of two submillimeter continuum imaging surveys . in both cases ,",
    "the emission is resolved into several components @xcite .",
    "recent near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy has revealed the presence of a small cluster of stars associated with the uc  region , including an o7 star ( with emission and absorption ) whose ionizing flux can account for all of the compact radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "these developments have prompted the higher angular resolution millimeterwave observations which are presented in this paper in hopes of understanding this active site of massive star formation .",
    "with the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) millimeter array @xcite , iras  18317@xmath00757  was simultaneously observed in 110  ghz continuum and c@xmath3o  ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "the continuum bandwidth was 600  mhz .",
    "the spectral resolution for the line data was 0.2  mhz ( 0.53  km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the phase gain calibrator was the quasar 1741@xmath0038 .",
    "the bandpass calibrator was 3c273 .",

    "a single track in b - configuration was obtained on 1998 october 10 , and in c - configuration on 1999 february 5 .",
    "the synthesized beam for the combined data imaged with robust weighting is @xmath17 by @xmath18 at a position angle of @xmath19 .    to recover the missing flux from extended structures in the interferometer spectral line data ,",
    "a single - dish map of c@xmath3o  ( 1 - 0 ) was recorded at the nrao 12 meter telescope on 16 june 2000 .",
    "a regular grid of 7x7 points was observed , with a spacing of @xmath20 providing full sampling of the telescope s @xmath21 beam .",

    "were obtained from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and in the mid - infrared bands from the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) archives @xcite and hires - processed iras data @xcite .",
    "radio continuum images were also retrieved from the vla galactic plane survey of @xcite .",
    "the 2.7 mm continuum image from our bima observations is shown in grayscale in figure  [ bimacont ] , along with overlays of the 6 cm and 20 cm contours from the vla galactic plane survey images @xcite . at all",
    "three wavelengths , the source structure consists of a bright rim on one edge of a partially - complete shell . both the iras point source and",
    "the msx point source positions lie close to the middle of the shell region . the bright",
    ", compact component was identifed as an irregular / multiple - peaked uc  region by @xcite . at the two longest radio wavelengths",
    ", additional faint emission extends to the northwest .",
    "the 350 micron continuum image from the survey of @xcite is shown in grayscale in figure  [ sharc ] .",
    "for comparison , the position of the iras and msx point sources are indicated along with the single - dish water maser position .",
    "five independent submillimeter sources can be identified and their coordinates and flux densities are given in table  [ sharctable ] .",
    "the two dominant sources are smm1 and smm2 .",
    "the peak of smm1 coincides with the uc  position .",
    "smm2 lies @xmath26 to the west , and likely coincides with the water maser emission , whose position is uncertain to @xmath27 ( no interferometric observations exist ) .",
    "the water maser is apparently quite variable over time : 60  jy in 1976 @xcite to 0.7  jy in 1989 @xcite to undetected in 2002 ( h. beuther 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the three other sources have no known counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "each of the msx images of this field show that the mid - infrared emission is dominated by the uc  region associated with smm1 .",
    "contour plots of two of the bands ( 8.3 and @xmath28 m ) are shown in figure  [ msx ] .",
    "the positions of the five submillimeter sources are indicated in both panels .",
    "the fitted positions of a two - dimensional gaussian model in each of the four msx bands all agree to within @xmath29 and fall within the iras psc error ellipse .",
    "of the five submillimeter sources , the peak in each band lies closest to smm1 .",
    "hires - processed images provide additional high resolution information from the iras data @xcite .",
    "the 20-iteration contour maps at 25 and @xmath30 m are shown in figure  [ hires ] , again with the five submillimeter sources marked .",
    "the emission remains essentially unresolved in each band , though there is some hint that the two westernmost submillimeter sources ( smm3 and 4 ) are detected in the contour extensions at 25 and 60@xmath31 m .",
    "using the flux density data from table  [ fluxes ] , the mid - infrared through radio wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the entire region is shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "the flux density measurements at wavelengths longward of 21  @xmath31 m have been fit with a simple two - temperature modified blackbody dust model plus a free - free component , summarized in table  [ sedfits ] .",
    "the flux density measurement at 1.3 mm from the literature @xcite should be considered a lower limit as it was obtained with a single element detector with a @xmath32 beam centered on the iras position , which misses most of smm3 and smm4 .",
    "the temperature of the cold component of dust ( 25k ) agrees quite well with the kinetic temperature ( 25.8k ) derived from ammonia ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations with a @xmath33 beam centered on the uc  position @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the warm component of dust dominates the total luminosity of the region , which is in contrast to more isolated high - mass protostellar objects @xcite and even many other uc  regions . using the grain emissivity index ( @xmath34 ) along with the temperature and optical depth derived from the fit",
    ", one can calculate the number of cold and warm grains required to explain the observed flux density @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mass of dust can then be calculated for each clump and for the extended emission . as is typical , the cold grains dominate the mass of dust .",
    "assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 @xcite , the total gas mass of each clump is listed in column six of table  [ sharctable ] and the total mass of the region is @xmath35  @xmath36 . using the individual gas masses and source diameters ( from the angular diameter and distance ) , we compute the column density of hydrogen ( @xmath37 ) toward each clump in column seven of table  [ sharctable ] .",
    "finally , we have estimated the visual and infrared ( @xmath12  band ) extinctions toward each clump by using the conversion formula of @xmath38 derived from observations of the ism at uv @xcite and x - ray wavelengths @xcite , followed by the relation @xmath39 from @xcite .",
    "the extinction values listed in columns eight and nine of table  [ sharctable ] have been further reduced by a factor of two to more accurately estimate the extinction toward a young star at the center of the clump , rather than behind it .",
    "as the sed model predicts , the free - free emission mechanism still dominates over the dust emission at frequencies as high as 110  ghz .",
    "in fact , the image at this frequency is nearly identical to the centimeter images .",
    "the 110  ghz flux densities for the smm1 - 5 are listed in table  [ sharctable ] .",
    "nearly all of the 110  ghz flux can be associated with smm1 , with the rest of the emission sitting just outside the @xmath26 aperture used to define this object in the @xmath40 m map . by contrast , we have not detected any emission for smm2 - 5 .",
    "each of these upper limits is consistent with an sed proportional to @xmath41 , corresponding to dust emission with @xmath42 . for the case of smm3 and smm4 , they lie sufficiently far from the main source that useful upper limits can be obtained from both the iras and msx data which provide a constraint on the individual properties of these dust cores . to visualize this constraint ,",
    "the spectral energy distributions of smm3 and smm4 are shown in figure  [ smmseds ] along with the two most extreme models consistent with the data .",
    "the corresponding dust temperature and luminosity upper and lower limits are summarized in table  [ sed34fits ] .",
    "although the luminosity remains uncertain to within a factor of 30 - 60 , the lower limits ( @xmath43@xmath2 ) indicate that these objects may be powered by individual massive stars or protostars .",
    "the integrated c@xmath3o  ( 1 - 0 ) line emission ( 75 - 85 km  s@xmath8 ) is shown as grayscale in figure  [ c18omom0 ] .",
    "the dotted circles denote the positions of the submillimeter continuum clumps from figure  [ sharc ] .",
    "the c@xmath3o  emission has been clipped ( set to zero ) at all points below @xmath44 ( 0.2 jy  beam@xmath8 ) .",
    "there are five major peaks of emission , four of which agree roughly with the submillimeter continuum sources smm1 - 4 .",
    "the strongest component peaks very close ( offset : @xmath45 ) to a small cluster of stars identified by @xcite that are associated with the uc  emission and smm1 .",
    "assuming optically - thin line emission with @xmath46k , we have computed the total column density of c@xmath3o listed in column 5 of table  [ c18oclumps ] .",
    "these values have been converted to visual extinction @xmath47 using the relationship of @xcite for the chamaeleon i dark cloud : @xmath48 .",
    "next , the values of @xmath47 have been converted @xmath49 ( see section [ sedsection ] ) and these are listed in column 6 of table  [ c18oclumps ] .",
    "assuming relative abundances of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the gas mass of each clump has been computed and listed in column 7 of table  [ c18oclumps ] .",
    "likewise , the mass of gas associated with each of the continuum sources smm1 - 5 is listed in table  [ smmc18oclumps ] .",
    "the total gas mass ( including the extended emission and all the clumps ) is @xmath52 .",
    "although this value is in good agreement with the mass derived independently from the total 350@xmath31 m dust emission , the fraction of mass in the extended emission ( outside of smm1 - 5 ) is 70% in c@xmath3o  but only 40% in dust .    to study the c@xmath3o  emission in greater detail , channel maps of c@xmath3oare shown in figure  [ c18ochanmaps ] .",
    "we have analyzed these maps in two ways : we first inspected the maps visually , then used an objective computer algorithm . in the visual method",
    ", we manually identified 26 cores in position - velocity space .",
    "shown in figure  [ c18ospectra ] is a grid of spectra constructed by integrating the emission in a @xmath53 aperture ( 0.24 pc ) centered at the position of each core .",
    "the mass contained within these apertures represents about 40% of the total gas mass .",
    "we next attempted to objectively analyze the c@xmath3o  date cube by running the `` clumpfind '' program @xcite .",
    "this algorithm contours the data , locates the peaks and follows them to the low intensity limit without any constraint on the shape of the resulting clump .",
    "it was designed to operate on large scale maps of gmcs in which the emission is well separated into distinct clumps .",
    "our data do not fit this description , as the cores are embedded in significant extended emission .",
    "nevertheless , we proceeded and used the recommended contour levels by setting both the starting contour and the contour interval to be twice the rms of the individual channel maps ( 0.6  jy  km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the program identified 17 clumps , three of which were weak and centered slightly outside the primary beam ( which we reject ) .",
    "the largest seven clumps range in mass from 200 - 1400  @xmath36 , while the smallest seven range from 18 - 94  @xmath36 .",
    "the fraction of mass placed into these 14 clumps is 45% of the total emission , which is quite similar to our visual technique .",
    "the emission from the several cores in the western ridge ( 2,4,5,6,7,8,10 ) were merged together by clumpfind into a single large clump in the late stages of the execution when the lowest contour levels are being examined . in a few other cases ,",
    "two initial clumps merged into one .",
    "this merging effect of the algorithm explains the fewer number ( but larger mass ) of clumps found .",
    "the rest of the clumps are in good general agreement with our visual identification technique .",
    "a gaussian line profile has been fit to each c@xmath3o  clump , and the corresponding velocity , amplitude and linewidth is given in table  [ c18oclumps ] .",
    "using the linewidth ( @xmath54 ) and aperture radius ( @xmath55 ) , we compute the virial mass from the formula : @xmath56(pc ) @xmath57 ( km@xmath58 s@xmath59 ) @xcite . in most cases , and in the overall sum , the virial masses of the clumps are quite similar to their c@xmath3o - derived masses , suggesting that the clumps are in hydrostatic equilibrium . in only three clumps",
    "does the c@xmath3o - derived mass exceed the virial mass by more than 50% . the highest excess ( 76% )",
    "is seen in clump  18 , associated with the uc  region .",
    "two of these clumps ( 17 and 18 ) lie near the uc  region and also exhibit the steepest spatial profiles , possibly suggesting an unstable condition .",
    "a cut along position angle @xmath60 in the velocity channel centered at 80.1 km  s@xmath8 is shown in figure  [ stripchan34 ] .",
    "the minimum in c@xmath3o  emission corresponds to the presence of the free - free continuum emission along the southern portion of the shell structure seen in figure  [ bimacont ] , thus the steep profile may be due to interaction with the uc  region .",
    "in any case , considering the uncertainties in the c@xmath3o  mass calculations , the good agreement between the c@xmath3o  mass and the virial mass is analagous to the results found in a survey of 40 lower - mass c@xmath3oclumps in the taurus complex @xcite .      in the 2mass all - sky data release point source catalog there are 123 objects within a @xmath11 radius of the uc  position .",
    "listed in table  [ twomass ] are the 44 of these stars that are detected in all three bands .",
    "the @xmath12 band image is shown in figure  [ 2massk ] with the position of the c@xmath3o  clumps indicated by dotted circles .",
    "in general , the non - coincidence between the two phenomena is striking .",
    "as listed in column 6 of table  [ c18oclumps ] , the extinction at k band through the c@xmath3o  clumps ranges from 2.3 to 12.5 magnitudes , with a median value of 8.1 .",
    "the faintest star detected has @xmath12 magnitude of 14.44 while the brightest upper limit has magnitude 10.11 .",
    "thus , even the brightest @xmath12 band star observed in the field ( star 112 with @xmath61 ) would be undetected if placed behind the typical clump .",
    "this fact may account for the lack of stars seen toward the c@xmath3o  clumps .",
    "a ( @xmath62 ) vs. ( @xmath63 ) color - color diagram of the 2mass stars is shown in figure  [ colorcolor ] .",
    "the solid line marks the locus of main sequence stars and the dashed lines denote the reddening vector which is annotated in magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "we see that 19 of the stars exhibit more than 10 magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "eleven of these 19 are located within the lowest c@xmath3o  contours ( see figure  [ c18omom0_2mass ] ) and are likely to be associated with the star - forming material of the cluster .",
    "for example , associated with the uc  region is a small cluster of five stars .",
    "of these five stars , star 92 is the object identified as an o8.5 star on the basis of its infrared spectrum ( with weak hei emission ) @xcite .",
    "it lies near the peak of the millimeter continuum map and is one of the few stars that reside within any of the c@xmath3o  clumps .",
    "the next closest star , number 86 , lies close to the center of the shell structure seen in the millimeter continuum .",
    "due to the presence of emission , it is classified as an o7 star .",
    "the ratio of to br@xmath64 confirms the level of ionizing flux expected from such a star . to within a factor of two ,",
    "it can account for all the lyman continuum flux from the centimeter emission and probably explains the shell - like symmetry . besides stars 86 and 92 , three additional stars ( 4 , 47 and 106 ) exhibit excess near - infrared emission ( i.e. they lie to the right of the reddening vector in figure  [ colorcolor ] ) which may indicate the presence of circumstellar disks . star 106 lies only @xmath65 from the center of smm5 , while star 47 lies at the edge of c@xmath3o  clump 12 .",
    "star 4 sits just outside the bima primary beam where very little c@xmath3o  has been detected .",
    "the brightest star in the field , number 112 , has @xmath24 magnitude 8.7 and the colors of an m2 star consistent with about 3 magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "it could be a foreground giant at 1.8  kpc .",
    "there is no reference to it in the simbad database .",
    "with the exception of the two o - stars associated with smm1 , and star 106 possibly associated with smm5 , none of the near - infrared stars are associated with the other submillimeter continuum or c@xmath3o  cores .",
    "the `` starless '' continuum objects smm2-smm4 may harbor embedded zams stars or protostars that are not yet visible in the near - infrared , while the c@xmath3o  cores have not yet formed protostars . if so , they may resemble the lower mass prestellar cores detected by iso @xcite . to examine this hypothesis",
    ", we can compare the limiting @xmath12  band magnitude of the 2mass image with the expected brightness of an embedded zams star with total luminosity equal to the dust luminosity of each core .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the individual luminosities of these cores due to the limited , coarse - resolution imaging data available on the mid - infrared side of their seds .",
    "however , using upper limits obtained from the msx and iras images ( as listed in table  [ sed34fits ] ) the luminosities of smm3 and 4 are constrained to be in the range @xmath66 @xmath2 , depending on the dust temperature . assuming the temperature of 25k derived for the region as a whole , yields a typical luminosity of @xmath67 @xmath2 consistent with a b0 star .",
    "a b0 star has absolute visual magnitude @xmath68 @xcite and @xmath69 @xcite , yielding @xmath70 . at a distance of 4.9 kpc ,",
    "this would be reduced to an apparent @xmath12 magnitude of 8.65 .",
    "if such a star was placed at the center of the smm4 dust cloud , a @xmath12 extinction of 6.4 magnitudes ( see table  [ sharctable ] ) would result , yielding a final @xmath12 magnitude of @xmath71 . by comparison",
    ", the faintest star detected in the 2mass image has a @xmath12 magnitude of 14.44 .",
    "thus we can not rule out the possibility that each submillimeter source ( smm2 - 5 ) may contain a zams or main sequence star rather than a protostar . deeper imaging in @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 band would improve the constraints . at present",
    ", our best reasonable conclusion is that smm2 - 5 contain some number of young stellar objects or main sequence stars with luminosities equivalent to at least a b - type star .    with the exception of smm5 , as one moves from east to west across the region ,",
    "the general trend is for objects in the cluster to exhibit fewer signs of compact , energetic phenomena .",
    "smm1 is associated with the well - developed uc  region .",
    "the dust core ( smm2 ) associated with the water maser probably traces an intermediate stage indicative of outflow or disk activity from the protostar .",
    "the next two dust cores ( smm3 and smm4 ) exhibit no maser activity or ionized gas .",
    "we note that the dust - derived masses for these two objects exceed but remain in reasonable agreement with the c@xmath3o - derived masses ( within 27% and 45% respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , the dust - derived mass of the faintest submillimeter source ( smm5 ) is a factor of 3 larger than the c@xmath3o - derived mass .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in the mass estimates are too large for us to interpret this difference in physical terms ( such as a depletion of co , which has been seen in objects such as b68 by @xcite ) .",
    "the other molecular cores not seen in continuum may be the youngest features in the region on their way to forming stars .",
    "or they could simply be colder , inactive objects where the accompanying dust emission is below the detection threshold .",
    "deeper and higher reoslution submillimeter observations are needed to explore these possibilities .",
    "the c@xmath3o  emission of iras  18317@xmath00757  is distributed in clumps aligned roughly along an east - west ridge .",
    "evidence of periodic density structure has been previously observed in c@xmath3o  in giant molecular clouds , specifically orion a @xcite .",
    "the typical spatial wavelength they find is 1  parsec , and the fragment masses range from 70 - 100 @xmath36 .",
    "more recently , fragmentation has been seen to extend to even smaller spatial scales in orion from vla observations of nh@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "similarly , new observations of the mini - starburst w43 in submillimeter dust continuum reveal about 50 fragments with typical size of 0.25  pc and mass of 300  @xmath36@xcite . in comparison , c@xmath3o  maps of the taurus complex reveal 40 dense cores of a similar typical size as those in w43 ( 0.23  pc ) but with a smaller typical mass of 23 @xmath36@xcite . in iras",
    "18317@xmath00757 the typical spacing we find between the major c@xmath3o  cores is roughly @xmath72 ( 0.5 pc ) , i.e. intermediate between orion and w43 , while our fragment masses range from 35 - 187 @xmath36 , i.e. intermediate between w43 and taurus .",
    "the fraction of total mass that resides in c@xmath3o  cores is 40% which is somewhat larger than the value of 20% seen in nh@xmath10 cores in w3oh @xcite , and the 19% seen in cs cores in orion b @xcite . in any case , it is becoming clear that high - mass star formation regions , like their low - mass counterparts , contain a wealth of information on the mass spectrum of protostellar fragmentation .",
    "whether these objects will all form stars remains unclear .",
    "a combination of single - dish and sensitive interferometric studies will be needed to better quantify the picture , especially down to the low mass end of the distribution .",
    "high resolution mid and far infrared imaging is needed to accurately determine the temperature and size of the individual dust cores presently identified , and to search for lower mass objects .",
    "deeper imaging in the near - infrared is needed to search for additional zams stars at high extinction levels within the dust and c@xmath3o  cores . also , narrow band imaging in @xmath73 lines and ( sub)millimeter interferometric imaging of sio transitions may help distinguish which of the cores show jets and outflows .",
    "submillimeter interferometry with higher spectral resolution in other optically - thin tracers less affected by depletion would be useful to search for evidence of active infall toward the c@xmath3o  cores identified in this work .",
    "finally , interferometric observations of the 22  ghz or submillimeter water maser transitions would be quite useful to better localize the maser activity to smm2 or one of the c@xmath3o  cores .",
    "our high angular resolution observations of the luminous ( log(l/@xmath2)=5.2 ) , massive star - forming region iras  18317@xmath00757  have revealed a complex field of objects likely to be in various stages of star formation .",
    "of the five submillimeter dust cores , one is associated with the uc  region g23.955 + 0.150 , and another with a water maser .",
    "the 2.7 mm continuum is completely dominated by free - free emission from the uc  region , with total flux and morphology in agreement with vla centimeterwave maps . for the other four objects , the upper limits found at 2.7 mm and in the msx mid - infrared band are consistent with pure optically - thin dust emission at temperatures of 13 - 40  k and a dust grain emissivity index @xmath42 .",
    "three out of four of these objects have no associated 2mass star , and they are each likely to contain at least one ( proto)star of luminosity 1000 - 40000 @xmath2 . in addition , we have identified two dozen c@xmath3o  cores in this region which contain @xmath4 of the total molecular gas mass ( @xmath74 ) present . their typical size is 0.25  pc and linewidth is 2 - 3 km  s@xmath8 . while the overall extent of the c@xmath3o  and dust emission is similar , most of the emission peaks do not correlate well in detail .",
