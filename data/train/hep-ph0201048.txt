    "there are convincing arguments from lattice simulations @xcite that qcd undergoes a phase transition at a temperature of about 150 - 170 mev @xcite from a confined hadronic phase to a phase where quarks and gluons constitute the relevant degrees of freedom , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is believed that chiral symmetry restoration , associated with the vanishing of the chiral condensate @xmath5 , takes place at about the same temperature .",
    "this new state of matter is clearly of enormous interest , and the search for experimental evidence of its creation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhic ) is going on .",
    "however , it is still a matter of debate whether the qgp has already been encountered .",
    "any signature of the qgp is folded with the time evolution ( and consequently the evolution of volume , temperature and baryon density ) of the fireball created in such a collision .",
    "furthermore , this evolution continues after the phase transition and any information is thus mixed with signals from the hadronic phase .",
    "therefore , extracting an unambiguous signal for the qgp phase is not an easy task .",
    "dileptons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs ) are interesting probes in this context since they do not interact strongly and escape unthermalized from the hot region at all stages of the collision . therefore ,",
    "in contrast to hadronic probes which can tell only of the late stages ( the freeze - out ) , dileptons carry information also on the early moments of the collision where the qgp phase is expected to exist . in the qgp phase , dileptons originate mainly from @xmath8 annihilation processes , whereas in the hadronic phase the main sources are pion and kaon annihilation processes which are enhanced due to the formation of the light vector mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in order to interpret signals from the qgp , one must obviously first understand the hadronic phase .",
    "unfortunately , the initial conditions of a fireball formed in urhic are not well under control , nor is its subsequent evolution known in sufficient detail so far .",
    "different scenarios ( pure hadronic , pure qgp and mixed phases ) can all be designed such that they are in rough agreement with experimental data .",
    "this is shown in calculations using microscopic transport equations @xcite , hydrodynamical descriptions @xcite and simplified approaches @xcite . in this paper , we make attempts to tighten the constraints on the qgp equation of state ( eos ) and the fireball evolution dynamics by establishing contacts with lattice qcd thermodynamics and hadronic observables .",
    "we extend the work of @xcite ( and other previous work ) in several directions .",
    "first , we develop a thermodynamically consistent quasiparticle picture , incorporating important aspects of confinement , to describe both the fireball dynamics and the dilepton radiation from the quark - gluon phase at the early stages of the collision .",
    "perturbation theory is known not to work in the quark - gluon phase @xcite even at temperatures well above @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt instead an approach which treats quarks and gluons as massive thermal quasiparticles , with their properties determined to reproduce lattice qcd results .",
    "the driving force of the phase transition , the confinement / deconfinement process , is given a statistical meaning in terms of a suppression of thermally active partonic degrees of freedom as the critical temperature is approached from above . for the hadronic phase ,",
    "we calculate the dependence of the photon spectral function ( that enters the dilepton rate ) on temperature and baryon density using vector meson dominance combined with chiral dynamics .",
    "second , a fireball model reminiscent of hydrodynamics is set up .",
    "the endpoint of the fireball evolution is fixed by requiring agreement with hadronic observables , such as hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) radii , @xmath12-spectra and @xmath13 distributions , which carry information on the freeze - out stage .",
    "information on the initial state can be gained by estimates of the nuclear overlap geometry .",
    "we then construct the evolution between initial and freeze - out conditions by following the fireball thermodynamics along volume slices of constant proper time @xmath14 .",
    "this is done under the assumption of entropy conservation where the total entropy of the system is determined at freeze - out .",
    "the eos in the qgp phase is calculated using a quasiparticle picture . in the hadronic phase a smooth interpolation to a hadronic resonance gas approach",
    "is applied .",
    "we thus obtain the temperature @xmath15 of the system at a given proper time .",
    "this procedure results in a thermodynamically self - consistent description of the fireball evolution , which is fixed by hadronic observables only .",
    "using this model as an input , we calculate dilepton rates and compare results to existing ceres / na45 data of 40 and 160 agev pb - au collisions , finding good agreement in both cases .",
    "we also give predictions for the kinematical conditions at rhic .",
    "differences between the present approach and other works are discussed .",
    "the lepton pair emission rate from a hot domain populated by particles in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath15 is proportional to the imaginary part of the spin - averaged , photon self - energy , with these particles as intermediate states .",
    "the thermally excited particles annihilate to yield a time - like virtual photon with four - momentum @xmath16 which decays subsequently into a lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "the differential pair production rate is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and we have neglected the lepton masses . we have defined @xmath20 and introduce the averaged photon spectral function @xmath21 . here @xmath22 denotes the trace over the thermal photon self - energy which is equivalent to the thermal current - current correlation function @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electromagnetic current .",
    "eq.([dileptonrates ] ) is valid to order @xmath25 in the electromagnetic interaction and to all orders in the strong interaction .    in order to compare with experimental data ,",
    "we construct a model for the space - time evolution of a heavy - ion collision , assuming approximate thermal equilibrium to be a useful concept @xcite .",
    "some recent discussions suggest @xcite that equilibration times at the conditions of heavy ion collisions at sps and rhic may indeed be very short ( possibly less than 1 fm / c ) , small compared to expansion times of order 10 - 20 fm / c , although this is still a matter of debate .",
    "the proper approach for our purposes is to use a simplified fireball model which employs a hot cylinder , expanding isentropically both in the longitudinal and transverse direction .",
    "temperature and density are assumed to be spatially homogeneous at a given proper time . in chapter",
    "[ sec_fireball ] , this fireball model is explained in detail .",
    "the differential rate of eq.([dileptonrates ] ) is integrated over the space - time history of the collision to compare the calculated dilepton rates with the ceres / na45 data @xcite taken in pb - au collisions at 160 agev ( corresponding to a c.m .",
    "energy of @xmath26 agev ) and 40 agev ( @xmath27 agev ) .",
    "the ceres experiment is a fixed - target experiment . in the lab frame",
    ", the ceres detector covers the limited rapidity interval @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 .",
    "we integrate the calculated rates over the transverse momentum @xmath30 and average over @xmath31 , given that @xmath32 the formula for the space - time- and @xmath33-integrated dilepton rates hence becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the freeze - out proper time of the collision , @xmath36 describes the proper time evolution of volume elements moving at different rapidities and the function @xmath37 accounts for the experimental acceptance cuts specific to the detector . at the ceres experiment ,",
    "each electron / positron track is required to have a transverse momentum @xmath38 gev , to fall into the rapidity interval @xmath39 in the lab frame and to have a pair opening angle @xmath40 mrad .",
    "eq.([integratedrates ] ) is then convoluted with the finite energy resolution of the detector .",
    "finally , for comparison with the ceres data , the resulting rate is divided by @xmath41 , the rapidity density of charged particles .",
    "rhic operates as a collider experiment , so in this case the fireball is centered around @xmath42 . here",
    ", the phenix detector acceptance can be schematically modelled by requiring that each electron / positron track falls in the rapidity interval @xmath43 , has transverse momentum @xmath44 gev and a pair opening angle of @xmath45 mrad . at present",
    ", an abundance of data on au - au collisions at @xmath0 = 130 agev have already been analysed , and first data of the run at the higher energy @xmath46 200 agev are available .",
    "in order to proceed , we need to develop a picture of the qcd dynamics in the quark - gluon plasma phase close to the phase transition where the system presumably spends an appreciable fraction of its time in urhic at current kinematical conditions . a realistic equation of state is needed to model the expanding fireball , and the calculation of the differential dilepton emission rate requires the photon self - energy with partonic intermediate states .",
    "since it is expected that @xmath47 at very high temperatures , one might naively expect that a perturbative approach to calculate these quantities is possible .",
    "however , it is now well - known that perturbation theory breaks down for gauge theories at finite temperature because of the occurrence of infrared divergences @xcite . the hard thermal loop ( htl )",
    "calculation scheme consistently resums all contributions to a given order in the gauge coupling constant @xmath48 and is explicitly gauge invariant .",
    "its application relies on a scale separation into hard ( @xmath49 ) and soft ( @xmath50 ) momentum modes with @xmath51 , though for qcd , this condition is likely to be fulfilled only at extremely large @xmath15 far outside the scope of present and future experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - abelian gauge theories also suffer from a dependence on an ultra - soft magnetic mass @xmath52 which is intrinsically nonperturbative .    the imaginary part of the photon self - energy im@xmath53 appearing in eq.([dileptonrates ] ) has been calculated to two - loop order in thermal perturbation theory @xcite , and there exist estimates for the three - loop contributions @xcite .",
    "so far , the convergence of the resulting series is badly behaved even for small couplings @xmath48 .",
    "a similar behaviour has been found in the perturbative calculation of the free energy of a qgp and also in simple scalar theory .",
    "furthermore , close to @xmath11 we expect intrinsically non - perturbative dynamics to enter : the confinement / deconfinement transition and chiral symmetry breaking are not amenable in an expansion in @xmath48 . in the light of these facts , we will use a more phenomenological approach to qcd thermodynamics in this work .",
    "one way to obtain nonperturbative input is through finite temperature lattice simulations of a pure gluonic or quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we have shown recently that it is possible to describe the equation of state ( eos ) of such systems to a very good approximation by the eos of a gas of quasiparticles with thermally generated masses , incorporating confinement phenomenologically by a temperature - dependent effective number of active degrees of freedom . here",
    "we give a short summary of the method and refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .    from asymptotic freedom , we expect that at extremely high temperatures the plasma consists of quasifree quarks and gluons .",
    "htl perturbative calculations find , for thermal momenta , spectral functions of the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 . as long as the spectral functions of the thermal excitations at lower temperatures resemble qualitatively this asymptotic form , a quasiparticle description is expected to be applicable .",
    "the qcd dynamics is then incorporated in the thermal masses of the effective quarks and gluons and in a function @xmath56 which is necessary for thermodynamical consistency and plays the rle of the thermal vacuum energy .",
    "since the existence of a preferred frame of reference ( in which the hot matter is at rest ) breaks lorentz invariance , new partonic excitations ( longitudinal gluonic plasmons and helicity - flipped plasminos ) are also present in the plasma . however , their spectral strengths are exponentially suppressed for high temperatures and momenta @xmath57 which dominate the integrals of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , entropy and energy density , therefore their contributions can be neglected .",
    "this is also in line with results from a lattice calculation of the quark and gluon propagators @xcite . for the differential dilepton rate ,",
    "their influence is not so easily discarded , and we will discuss that in section [ sec_calculation ] .",
    "the thermal excitations can then be described by a dispersion equation @xmath58 here , @xmath59 , and the subscript @xmath60 labels the particle species : @xmath61 for gluons and @xmath62 for quarks .",
    "@xmath63 stands for a thermal mass which is derived from the self - energy of the corresponding particle , evaluated at thermal momenta @xmath64 .",
    "this is expected to be meaningful as long as the self - energy is only weakly momentum dependent in that kinematic region . additionally , for a quasiparticle to be a meaningful concept at all",
    ", we require the imaginary part of the self - energy , and hence its thermal width , to be small .    the gluon mass , following ref .",

    "the functional dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath15 is based on the conjecture that the phase transition is weakly first order or second order which suggests an almost powerlike behaviour @xmath70 with some pseudo - critical exponent @xmath71 . setting @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74",

    "we now proceed as follows : we adopt the picture of the qgp as a quasiparticle gas consisting of massive quarks and gluons which are the relevant thermodynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting eos serves as input for the construction of the fireball which is discussed in section [ sec_fireball ] .",
    "furthermore , within this framework the quasiparticle @xmath8-loop becomes the only contribution to the photon self - energy in eq.([dileptonrates ] ) since the quasiparticles are by construction non - interacting .",
    "the reduced probability for thermally exciting a quark because of confinement , and the thermal effective masses , have to be taken into account properly as discussed in the next section .",
    "as long as the thermodynamically active degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons , the timelike photon couples to the continuum of thermally excited @xmath98 states and subsequently converts into a charged lepton pair .",

    "this result , however , holds only up to perturbative higher order corrections in @xmath48 that take into account collective plasma effects . here , contributions from soft gluons lead to strong modifications .",
    "the corresponding two- and three - loop contributions show no clear convergence @xcite .",
    "close to the phase transition , we also expect non - perturbative confinement physics to enter .",
    "consequently , we follow a different approach .",
    "recalling the results of the previous section , the thermodynamic properties of the qgp as given by lattice qcd are well reproduced by a gas of quasiparticles .",
    "let us now assume that a quark quasiparticle couples to a photon in the same way as a bare quark ( a form factor representing the cloud of the quasiparticle could in principle also be included , but in absence of information about the detailed quasiparticle structure we ignore this point ) .",
    "for a gas of non - interacting quasiparticles , the one - loop result for im@xmath104 is adequate , with input properly adjusted .",
    "all higher order qcd effects manifest in the thermal quasiparticle masses @xmath105 , the function @xmath56 and the confinement factor @xmath90 .",
    "incorporation of the first two features in the calculation is straightforward .",

    "the thermal vacuum energy @xmath56 does not contribute to the dilepton rate .",
    "the naive replacement @xmath106 is , however , not permitted in eq .",
    "( [ e - impi ] ) .",
    "since any modification of the free particle distribution functions leads to non - equilibrium field theory , products of delta functions ( pinch singularities ) may arise in loop calculations .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticle model as it stands can not be used in expressions derived from simple perturbative thermal field theory . recalling the physical interpretation of the confinement factor @xmath90",
    ", we can use the expression for the dilepton rate , eq .",
    "( [ dileptonrates ] ) , instead .",
    "the mechanism for dilepton production at tree - level is the annihilation of a @xmath98 pair into a virtual photon where the quark lines are multiplied by the distributions @xmath107 , giving the probability of finding a quark or an antiquark in the hot medium .",
    "this also becomes clear when we look at the limit @xmath108 of eq .",

    "the incorporation of the confinement factor is now obvious : since it reduces the number of thermally active degrees of freedom , it also reduces the dilepton rate by a factor of @xmath114 .    in summary , eq .",
    "( [ dileptonrates ] ) can be used to calculate the dilepton rate originating from a hot qgp phase , provided an overall factor @xmath114 is applied to account for the reduced probabilities , and the bare masses @xmath102 in the one - loop expression ( [ e - impi ] ) are replaced by the @xmath15-dependent thermal masses ( [ m_quark ] ) .",
    "the rle of the factor @xmath90 is illustrated in figure  [ f - conf - rate ] , where the differential dilepton rate originating from a hot qgp in the quasiparticle approach is shown for different temperatures . note that the plotted quantity is independent of the fireball volume , so the resulting differences are only due to the dropping quasiparticle masses and the squared confinement factor @xmath90 , which is responsible for a decrease by more than an order of magnitude at @xmath115 as compared to the highest temperature shown .",
    "one also observes that , as expected , the ( negative ) slope of the production rate in the region of high invariant mass gets steeper as the temperature decreases .",
    "it is important to note that this setup neglects contributions from hadronic degrees of freedom above @xmath11 .",
    "as mentioned , quarks and gluons become clustered into hadrons ( glueballs , mesons ) as the temperature approaches @xmath11 from above .",
    "these hadronic excitations are comparatively heavy and thus do not contribute much to the thermodynamics . since we do not know in detail how the statistical re - arrangement of degrees of freedom occurs , we refrain from including these hadronic sources of dilepton yield above @xmath11 . our calculation is therefore expected to give a _ lower limit _ on the leptonic radiation from the qgp phase",
    ".    the quasiparticle model does not take into account the collective plasma modes , such as the ( longitudinal ) gluonic plasmons and the ( helicity - flipped ) quark plasminos .",
    "since their residues are exponentially suppressed in the htl approximation for thermal momenta @xmath116 , their contributions to the thermodynamical quantities are negligible . however , in the case of soft dilepton production it is well known that these modes lead to sharp , distinct structures in the spectrum , referred to as van hove singularities @xcite .",
    "the plasmino branch has a minimum in its dispersion relation at @xmath117 ( which follows on very general grounds @xcite , independent of the htl approximation ) .",
    "this leads to a diverging density of states which , in turn , shows up in the dilepton spectrum as a pronounced peak .",
    "our model can not exhibit , by construction , such plasmino effects .",
    "however , since the peaks are roughly located at @xmath118 , where @xmath78 is the thermal mass of the quasiparticles , these van hove singularities would be smeared out by the fireball evolution .",
    "the thermal mass drops as the temperature goes down , dragging along the peak position with it .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath78 is of the order of the temperature @xmath15 or smaller in our model , the singularities appear at low invariant mass ( @xmath119 mev ) where they are overwhelmed by the hadronic part of the dilepton production . therefore the presence of these collective modes would presumably not influence our results for the dilepton rate in the qgp phase .",
    "our model of the qgp phase also finds preliminary support from a recent lattice calculation @xcite of thermal vector meson correlation functions above @xmath11 in quenched qcd with clover improved wilson fermions . using the maximum entropy method ,",
    "the vector spectral function was extracted from the corresponding current correlator .",
    "although the statistical uncertainties are still considerable , it is interesting to note that the resulting spectrum resembles the free spectral function , as in our case , and has a gap at low energies given by a thermal mass threshold of @xmath120 , which is indeed close to @xmath121 , the natural cut - off of the spectrum and , correspondingly , of the thermal dilepton radiation in the confinement model ( see figure [ f - conf - rate ] ) . furthermore , this result seems to rule out heavy quark quasiparticles in the deconfined phase , as predicted by other phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "of course , higher statistics and improved actions are mandatory to confirm these observations .",
    "below @xmath11 , confinement sets in and the effective degrees of freedom change to colour singlet , bound @xmath8 or @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) states . the photon couples now to the lowest - lying dipole excitations of the vacuum , the hadronic @xmath124 states : the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath10 mesons and multi - pion states carrying the same quantum numbers .",
    "the electromagnetic current - current correlation function can be connected to the currents generated by these mesons using an effective lagrangian which approximates the @xmath127 flavour sector of qcd at low energies .",

    "we practically implement the @xmath147 contribution by adding a flat @xmath152 continuum to the resonance @xmath125 meson spectral function that feeds into the photon spectral function , reminiscent of the perturbative plateau of @xmath8 annihilation .",
    "there is still considerable stopping of the interpenetrating nuclei at sps energies , resulting in a net baryon density @xmath153 in the central rapidity region . at rhic , measurements @xcite indicate that the proton over antiproton excess is small , implying that the baryons are distributed over a larger rapidity interval . therefore , finite baryon density effects should not play such an important role at rhic kinematics .",
    "for the evaluation of density effects which are relevant at sps conditions , we use the results discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that in the linear density approximation , @xmath154 is related to the vector meson - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath155 : @xmath156 with @xmath157 being zero - momentum free nucleon states . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the temperature- and density dependences of @xmath154 factorize , _ i.e. _ we replace @xmath158 in eq.([piv ] ) by the temperature - dependent @xmath159 and leave @xmath155 unaffected .",
    "this amounts to neglecting contributions from matrix elements such as @xmath160 ( nucleon - pion scatterings where the pion comes from the heat bath ) .",
    "furthermore , this approximation does not take into consideration a possible @xmath15-dependent pion or nucleon mass .",
    "some effective models suggest that , near the phase transition , the nucleon mass follows the behaviour of the chiral condensate @xmath161 and drops abruptly as the quarks lose their constituent masses .",
    "such modifications of particle properties may have a considerable impact on the spectral functions .",
    "however , since the temperature range over which the dropping takes place is narrow , we expect such effects not to leave distinct signals in the dilepton spectra which are only sensitive to the integrated time ( and hence temperature ) evolution of the system .",

    "the situation is shown for the rhic scenario in figure  [ f - entropyrhic ] and compared to the ideal quark - gluon gas and the hadronic resonance gas approach used in other works ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "one can clearly observe that the deviations in both the quark - gluon phase and the hadronic phase from the ideal gas are large , amounting to a factor of more than two for the entropy density near @xmath11 .",

    "our interpolation starts .",
    "this situation is shown in figure  [ f - entropysps ] .",
    "one observes that , unlike the rhic scenario , the entropy density under sps conditions is larger in the range @xmath257 , resulting in a faster dropping of temperature during the hadronic expansion phase .",

    "it is mainly the detailed information on the final and initial state which enables us to reconstruct the fireball evolution in the case of the 160 agev central collision scenario .",
    "unfortunately , no such detailed analysis is available for the 30% central pbau collision scenario for which dilepton data have been taken .",
    "the same holds for the 40 agev dilepton data .",
    "it is therefore necessary to extend the framework established so far to different centralities and beam energies by a suitable re - scaling of key quantities characteristic of the evolution .",
    "first of all , the total entropy deposition in the fireball region must be different when going to more peripheral collisions or lower beam energies .",
    "we assume that the entropy per baryon scales with the number of negatively charged hadrons observed in the final state and take the sps value of @xmath271 as a baseline .",
    "when going to peripheral collisions , we assume that this value is still a good estimate . here",
    ", the total entropy in the system is naturally reduced because the number of nucleons participating in the collision is smaller .",
    "second , the overlap geometry is different in peripheral collisions , resulting in a smaller initial fireball volume . here , we neglect details of the transverse geometry and keep parametrizing the fireball volume as a cylinder .",
    "its initial transverse area is adjusted to the value of the calculated overlap area , hence the cylinder radius is reduced as compared to central collisions .    for the 40 agev data , we take the total entropy to be about half the entropy at 160 agev because @xmath272 and @xmath273 . the initial energy density , estimated by bjorken s formula from @xmath13 at midrapidity , is about @xmath274 of the value at 160 agev , but still well above the critical energy density required to form a qgp plasma .",
    "looking at the final state of the fireball , hbt analyses of na49 @xcite indicate that the radius parameters are very similar at 40 and 160 agev , suggesting that the reaction dynamics do not significantly change in this energy region .",
    "changes in the initial entropy deposition result in a correspondingly different fireball evolution and in general a different freeze - out state .",
    "freeze - out occurs when the mean free path of particles exceeds the dimensions of the fireball .",
    "as pions are the most abundant particle species in the fireball , we assume that the pion density determines the mean free path @xmath275 of particles in the medium .",
    "the freeze - out condition reads therefore @xmath276 where @xmath277 stands for a typical hadronic cross section . as the observed hbt radii for 40 and 160",
    "agev appear rather similar , we do not expect the total freeze - out volume to change more than a factor two .",

    "this is still true if we take modificatios of the pion density by a pion chemical potential @xmath280 into account  about the same value of @xmath280 is needed in all sps scenarios to account for the observed total pion yield ( see section [ chemical ] ) .",
    "the situation is different at rhic . here",
    ", no large pion chemical potential appears to be necessary to account for the observed total yield and therefore the thermal pion density at a given temperature is lower , leading to a higher freeze - out temperature with ( [ e - fo ] ) .",
    "we find that an expansion scenario with @xmath281 = 130 mev fits both the observed total particle yield and leads to the correct freeze - out pion density .",
    "the freeze - out volume has now to be adjusted accordingly . in order to do this consistently ,",
    "we simultaneously modify both the final state flow velocities and the fireball radius as compared to our standard scenario . as",
    "these quantities result to a first approximation from an accelerated motion , reducing the radial flow by a factor @xmath103 implies a reduction of the longitudinal flow difference between initial and final state by the same factor @xmath103 and a reduction of the freeze - out radius by @xmath282 .",
    "note that a combination of decreasing geometrical radius _ and _ flow velocity tends to keep the hbt radius constant .",
    "the fireball evolution is now calculated as described above , using re - scaled total entropy , initial radius , final state longitudinal and transverse flow and freeze - out radius as new inputs .",
    "the parameter sets obtained for the different fireball scenarios are summarized in the appendix .",
    "the resulting volume evolutions for 40 and 160 agev are plotted in figure  [ f - vc2 ] .",

    "the temperature evolution is shown in figure  [ f - tprofiles ] .",
    "we observe that the qgp phase lasts about half of the total fireball lifetime for 160 agev , and considerably less for 40 agev .    as the fireball evolution resulting from our model differs somewhat from the results obtained by other groups",
    ", we feel that some clarifying remarks are in order .    in our quasiparticle model",
    "there is no mixed phase of coexisting hadronic gas and qgp .",
    "based on the observation that there is _ no strong first order _ transition visible in the lattice data , the eos right and left of @xmath11 match smoothly . inserting the eos of an ideal quark - gluon gas instead , a large gap in the @xmath81 diagram",
    "is created .",
    "the resulting latent heat @xmath283 generates a mixed phase of considerable duration ( 5 - 10 fm ) , as found in previous approaches .    by construction of the model , hadronic observables derived from the expanding fireball , _",
    "e.g. _ rapidity distributions of charged particles , @xmath284-spectra , hbt radii and observed particle numbers , are described adequately .",
    "this is an important constraint of the model .",
    "there is very little freedom left to tune the fireball evolution .",
    "arguably , the eos inferred from the quasiparticle model is the weakest point in the chain of arguments leading to the complete picture .",
    "however , bulk quantities such as freeze - out proper time and freeze - out volume are hardly influenced by the eos or the phase transition temperature .",
    "they can be found even by assuming constant acceleration at all times .",
    "the initial temperatures are quite large ( @xmath285 300 mev for sps central conditions , 420 mev for rhic ) and are uniquely determined by the total entropy , the initial volume and our eos for the quark - gluon phase . to some extent",
    "these large values related to our choice of the formation time @xmath286 fm/@xmath203 ( sps ) and @xmath287 fm/@xmath203 ( rhic ) of the thermal system ; if @xmath216 is increased , the initial temperature decreases correspondingly . however , unlike the results found in @xcite , we do not observe any strong sensitivity of the dilepton yields to the choice of @xmath216 : as the fireball expands , differences in the initial volume become increasingly unimportant . if the total evolution time of the qgp phase is small , these changes may well matter , but as the lifetime of the qgp phase in our model is comparatively large , the possible difference affects only a small fraction of the total lifetime in a region where the fireball volume ( and , correspondingly the dilepton yield ) is small anyway .    comparing with the bjorken estimate of the initial energy density",
    ", one should keep in mind that the extrapolation from the final to the initial state is different in the present approach . in the bjorken scenario ,",
    "no longitudinal acceleration is present , therefore the mapping of final state rapidity distributions to initial state spatial distributions finds a larger initial volume than our scenario .",
    "if we assume no or only small longitudinal acceleration in order to compare the two approaches , we find initial temperatures between 220 and 240 mev , consistent with the bjorken estimate . as this assumption is incompatible with a freeze - out at 100 mev and the measured freeze - out geometry , we disregard it .",
    "we observe a prolonged lifetime of the qgp evolution phase of the fireball as compared to the results obtained by other groups .",
    "recall that the apparent lifetime of the qgp , as observed in the lab frame , is larger than its lifetime in proper time @xmath14 .",
    "this is a consequence of our volume evolution and the use of the more realistic eos of our quasiparticle model , as opposed to that of the ideal quark - gluon gas .",
    "near the phase transition , the entropy density in the quasiparticle model is about a factor two smaller than the one of the ideal quark - gluon gas , and it takes a correspondingly larger volume ( and larger evolution time ) to reach this entropy density in an isentropic expansion .",
    "the slower cooling time in the hadronic phase of the rhic scenario as compared to sps conditions can in essence be traced back to the fact that the entropy density under sps conditions is enhanced by the fugacity factors whereas this is not such an important effect for rhic .",
    "as already mentioned , the total thermal pion yield of the fireball at freeze - out is not enough to account for the observed number of pions , and a large chemical potential of @xmath288 mev has to be used to compensate @xcite .",
    "the common point of view is that particle numbers are fixed at a chemical freeze - out point @xcite and the absence of inelastic reactions introduces then a chemical potential .",
    "the statistical model is enormously succesful in describing the finally observed ratio as a fit of chemical freeze - out temperature and baryon density , using the free properties of particles .",
    "however , in the hot and dense environment of a fireball , in medium modifications of particle masses and widths are likely to occur , changing the amount of particle production at the freeze - out temperature .",
    "this is not in direct contradiction to the apparent success of the statistical model , as a different set of @xmath15 and @xmath289 might be able to explain the observed ratios once the modifiactions are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the absence of all inelastic reactions , leading to decay processes only , is most likely an oversimplification for some particles , e.g. for the @xmath290 system .",
    "if one knew the particle properties and the particle abundancies at hadronization reliably , the correct way to proceed would be to set up a system of coupled rate equations and follow the various decay and recombination processes to the thermal freeze - out .",
    "unfortunately , theoretically there is no way to assess these properties reliably near the phase transition , as this is a nonperturbative problem . keeping these issues in mind",
    ", we will therefore parametrize the hadrochemistry of the fireball on a phenomenological basis instead of aiming for a detailed solution of the problem .",
    "we adopt the following approach : a pion chemical potential is introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ and fitted at the thermal freeze - out point ( @xmath288 mev @xcite ) to the total pion multiplicity .",
    "it is assumed to decrease with temperature linearly up to @xmath11 where it vanishes , corresponding to a situation where resonance decays continuously feed pions into the system .",
    "all other necessary chemical potentials are adjusted such as to reproduce the observed pion to particle ratios at all times .",
    "once the time evolution of the fireball is given in terms of the temperature @xmath243 , the baryon density @xmath291 and the volume @xmath258 , and with the knowledge of the photon spectral function , we have all the necessary ingredients to calculate dilepton rates using eq .",
    "( [ integratedrates ] ) .",
    "we fold the result with the acceptance of the ceres and the phenix detectors , respectively , and average over the rapidity region covered by these two experiments .",
    "the so - called hadronic cocktail , dileptons produced after freeze - out through various decay processes , with the exception of vector - meson decays , is then added .",
    "this contribution fills the region of very low invariant masses ( @xmath292 mev ) .",
    "the dilepton yields resulting from direct vector meson decays after freeze - out , as described in subsection [ subsec_after ] , and the drell - yan yield from subsection [ subsec_dy ] are added to the hadronic cocktail , taking into account the limited kinematic acceptance and resolution of the detector .",
    "we start with a discussion of the sps ceres / na45 experiment , treating 40 agev and 160 agev data in parallel .",
    "the final results for the dilepton invariant mass spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ results_160 ] and [ results_40 ] .",
    "our calculation reproduces the overall spectrum of the 160 agev ceres data quite well .",
    "it overestimates the rates somewhat around invariant masses of 200 to 400 mev and achieves a good description in the region above 400 mev up to 1.8 gev .",
    "recall that our qgp model rate constitutes only a lower limit on the actual rate because it neglects the radiation from non - partonic ( cluster ) degrees of freedom above the critical temperature .",
    "bearing in mind that the region above 1 gev is mainly populated by dileptons originating from the qgp phase , as evident from the left panel of figure [ results_160 ] , there might still be additional radiation close above @xmath11 arising from hadronic clusters embedded in a qgp environment .",
    "the drell - yan contribution is non - negligible , but still outshined by the qgp by a factor of 3 .",
    "changes in the spectra of the vector mesons indicate tendencies towards chiral symmetry restoration , so the right panel of figure [ results_160 ] shows the contributions of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath10 mesons separately , not including the after freeze - out yield .",
    "the @xmath125 meson loses its quasiparticle structure entirely due to strong collision broadening at finite density , and fills the whole low mass region between the two pion threshold and @xmath293 mev .",
    "the @xmath126 meson , a sharp peak in the vacuum , broadens at finite temperature due to the thermal scattering process @xmath294 .",
    "furthermore , the mass shift at finite baryon density smears the remaining peak structure considerably .",
    "effectively , the remaining signal arises from the direct decays of @xmath126 mesons after freeze - out .",
    "the @xmath10 has become a spread - out but still visible resonance structure , showing only moderate broadening at finite temperature and baryon density .",
    "it might therefore be a suitable candidate for gauging the strength of vector meson modification .    to test the modelling of the vector meson spectra",
    ", we calculate the total number of @xmath126 and @xmath10 meson , suitably averaged over their medium - induced spread in invariant mass , as @xmath295 and @xmath296 comparing with numbers from a statistical model calculation , @xmath297 and @xmath298 @xcite , we indeed find reasonable agreement .",
    "note that the relatively large @xmath126 meson yield is primarily caused by the pion fugacity factor @xmath299 ^ 3 $ ] at freeze - out , which reflects the enhanced feeding through the @xmath300 process .",
    "going from 160 agev to 40 agev beam energy , analyses of hbt radii and transverse radial flow @xcite indicate that the reaction dynamics do not change dramatically , therefore we do not expect drastic differences in the rate .",
    "indeed , the data at 40 agev look similar to the 160 agev case , and the calculated rate , shown in figure [ results_40 ] , also bears this similarity and achieves a good fit without tuning the setup of the model .",
    "since the initial temperature is lower and the qgp phase shorter in the 40 agev case , the partonic dilepton contribution is obviously much smaller , but nevertheless still present . owing to the greater initial baryonic density , the in - medium modifications of the vector mesons become more pronounced , most prominently visible in the @xmath126 meson channel .",
    "its downward mass shift drags the peak structure along the time evolution of the fireball , creating a small bump on top of the completely dissolved @xmath125 meson that fills up the low - mass region again .",
    "its yield after freeze - out constitutes a visible signal that may be experimentally observable with suitable energy resolution .",
    "the @xmath10 meson contribution clearly sticks out above the smooth @xmath125 meson continuum. to conclude , we find no distinct differences in our calculation for the two beam energies probing dilepton production at sps so far , in accord with experimental findings .",
    "this indicates that the general setup of our model is fairly robust .",
    "future data at 20 and 80 agev will aid to test this statement .",
    "the fact that we moderately overestimate the data in the region between 200 and 300 mev invariant mass requires a comment .",
    "since this range is dominated by the low - mass behaviour of the @xmath125 meson spectral function at finite density , this behaviour may indicate that the influence of finite three - momentum on the spectra in that very region is non - negligible .",
    "consider the 160 agev and 40 agev data taken for different transverse momenta @xmath301 mev and @xmath302 mev , shown in figures  [ results_160_pt ] and [ results_40_pt ] .",
    "we observe that the general shape of the data pattern is well described by the calculation for both @xmath284 regions and both beam energies .",
    "however , for the high @xmath284 case , the calculation again overshoots the data in the low mass region whereas this is not so in the low @xmath284 case .",
    "this can be traced to the use of the spectral functions for three - momentum equal to zero in order to describe the photon spectral function in the hadronic phase .",
    "this approximation is of limited validity at high @xmath284 where the spectral function ought to become smaller than in our approximation .",
    "therefore we expect improved agreement with the data for the low invariant mass region both at 40 and 160 agev once this effect is taken into account properly .",
    "our setup of the fireball model enables us to gain additional detailed insight into the time evolution of the dilepton yield .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ f - spstime ] . here",
    "the different stages of the fireball evolution leave distinct marks in the time - resolved dilepton yield .",
    "for early times , dileptons come entirely from the @xmath98 quasiparticle annihilation processes .",
    "the movement of the invariant mass threshold reflects the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle mass which decreases near the phase transition at @xmath303 fm / c .",
    "one observes that , in spite of the growing fireball volume , the contributions from later timeslices to the total yield become progressively less important until the hadronic phase takes over at @xmath304 fm / c .",
    "this surprising behaviour is enforced by the confinement factor @xmath90 which reduces the thermodynamically active degrees of freedom significantly near the phase boundary .",
    "the system then enters the hadronic evolution phase without going through a mixed phase .",
    "the most prominent feature is the rapid filling of the low invariant mass region through the density - broadened @xmath125 meson spectrum which ends up as an enhanced pion continuum .",
    "the @xmath10 meson starts contributing its characteristic peak and , as the system cools down further , the @xmath126 meson begins to emerge , albeit as a broad structure .",
    "note that while the hadronic contributions fill primarily the low invariant mass region , their yield above 1 gev is negligible in this late evolution phase .      for the rhic scenario ,",
    "thermally generated dileptons are dominant .",
    "measurements of proton ratios at @xmath46 130 agev indicate that the central collision region remains almost net - baryon free , compared to sps energies . within a statistical thermal model , the particle ratios are accounted for by a small baryon chemical potential of about 50 mev at chemical freezeout @xcite . at 200 agev",
    ", this value is predicted to be even smaller .",
    "effects of finite baryon density are therefore almost absent and consequently both the @xmath125 and the @xmath10 are expected to show up in the spectrum as pronounced structures , whereas there should be no clear trace of the in - medium @xmath126 due to its strong thermal broadening .",
    "contributions from drell - yan processes , which dominate in the very high invariant mass region , are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the corresponding prediction for the dilepton yield at 200 agev , including the schematic acceptance for the phenix detector , is shown in figure [ results_200 ] .",
    "the @xmath126 and @xmath10 meson resonances clearly stick out over the smooth @xmath125 meson and qgp contributions .",
    "although phenix will only start to measure at @xmath305 1 gev , it may be possible to resolve the @xmath10 meson peak .",
    "however , a significant part of the peak strength is built up by the after freeze - out contributions , making it difficult to disentangle the in - medium modifications on the hadrons . for @xmath306 gev ,",
    "the dilepton spectrum is dominated by thermal qgp radiation , outshining the hard drell - yan dilepton yield .",
    "comparing our prediction for phenix with the one shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find rough agreement of the rate for the low mass region below @xmath307 gev .",
    "although the dilepton yield from the qgp phase is suppressed in our case by the factor @xmath114 ( cf .",
    "section [ subsec_qgp ] ) , we still find an enhancement of a factor of about 4 in the range @xmath308 gev over the rate in @xcite that employs a ( perturbative ) chemical undersaturation model in the qgp phase . owing to the non - perturbative nature of the qgp close to @xmath11 , this model may not be applicable in that very region .",
    "note that our rate also constitutes only a lower limit there , so that the actual rate may even be larger .",
    "high precision data will allow to pin down one or the other model .",
    "we would like to stress that the gross features of our model are set , once the parametrization of the fireball evolution has been matched to the hadronic observables and the eos of both phases has been constructed in accordance with lattice qcd and empirical constraints .",
    "the remaining uncertainties , mainly about the initial state of the fireball , the thermal masses of the quasiparticles and the detailed shape of the eos , do not alter the results substantially ; they lead to only moderate or even weak dependence on those parameters .",
    "fine - tuning is still possible , but only within the limits that retain consistency with the overall framework .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the model to parameter changes in some detail for the sps scenario at 160 agev . in order to get a theoretical error band",
    ", we investigated the extremes of our parameter ranges , a combination of parameters that yields the largest and the smallest possible qgp contribution .",
    "the resulting range is shown in figure [ errorband_160 ] as a grey band , together with the data points and the curve from the previous section .",
    "regarding the initial conditions , the largest uncertainty comes from the initial fireball formation length @xmath309 or , equivalently , the time @xmath216 .",
    "we let it vary from 0.5 fm/@xmath203 to 2 fm/@xmath203 , i.e. from fast to slow equilibration . consider next the initial longitudinal flow velocity @xmath310 .",
    "a variation of this quantity from @xmath311 @xmath203 to @xmath312 @xmath203 implies a modification of the pressure - driven accelerated motion in order to arrive at the same final velocity of @xmath313 @xmath203 , as determined by the rapidity distributions of the observed hadrons .",
    "strong deviations from @xmath314 @xmath203 , however , lead to inconsistent values for the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath164 .",
    "finally , modifications of the critical temperature @xmath11 influence mainly the relative weight of the contributions from the qgp phase and the hadronic gas phase to the dilepton yield and hence change the shape of the dilepton spectra .",
    "lattice data on @xmath11 suggest a range from 140 mev for three massless , thermally active flavours to about 185 mev for two massless flavours and a realistic pion mass .",
    "due to the self - consistent modelling of the temperature and volume evolution , there is no simple one - to - one correspondence of these parameters to the dilepton yield .",
    "the upper limit of the grey band in figure [ errorband_160 ] now corresponds to the scenario with a _ small _ qgp contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ small @xmath216 , large @xmath218 and high @xmath11 . on the other hand , the lower limit",
    "includes a _",
    "qgp contribution with large @xmath216 , small @xmath218 and low @xmath315 .",
    "it is instructive to note that the shape of the spectrum changes only moderately above 1 gev invariant mass within these extreme parameter variations .",
    "the first scenario , however , tends to overestimate the data in the region of the @xmath125 peak , whereas the second scenario does not leave enough time for the hadronic phase to build up the @xmath6 excess in the low - mass region between 200 and 800 mev , effectively ruling out a large qgp contribution .",
    "we have calculated dilepton radiation from an expanding fireball created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions over a wide range of beam energies , from sps 40 agev via sps 160 agev to rhic @xmath46 200 agev .",
    "we have explored the evolution of a fireball through the quark - gluon and hadronic phases as they are assumed to be characteristic of the qcd equation of state .",
    "furthermore , we have emphasized the relevance of using input and constraints from lattice qcd thermodynamics in the analysis of dilepton signals from the expanding fireball .",
    "the fact that the measured dilepton rates could be reproduced using a fireball model fixed by hadronic information only is a nontrivial confirmation of its validity .",
    "further data for different energies and/or nuclear systems will help to strengthen or weaken this position .",
    "high resolution measurements of the invariant mass spectrum around the region of the @xmath126 and the @xmath10 mass can reveal information on the average density and temperature in the hadronic phase .",
    "the broadening and mass shift of the @xmath126 meson with temperature can serve as a thermometer once the cocktail contribution is reliably assessed .",
    "a visible enhancement in the @xmath126 region beyond the rate originating from @xmath126-decays after freeze - out would hint at a temperature which is on average lower than assumed in this model and therefore point to a lower freeze - out temperature or alternative in - medium effects on hadrons . on the other hand , the @xmath10 meson signal , being nearly unmodified by temperature effects over a comparably long timespan , may be used as a standard candle at rhic conditions .",
    "detailed knowledge of the slope of the invariant mass spectrum above 1 gev gives an indication of the average temperature in the quark - gluon phase , serving as a constraint for the fireball dynamics in the qgp region .",
    "its total normalization is useful to estimate the effects of a possible underpopulation of the quark and gluon phase space in early stages of the evolution , or of phenomenological models of the qgp , such as the confinement model presented in section [ sec_quasiparticles ] .",
    "it is remarkable that this confinement model is able to reproduce the data despite the suppression of dilepton radiation near the phase transition temperature .",
    "measurements using different nuclear systems or different impact parameter can provide different relative weights of qgp and hadronic dilepton radiation to the observed yield .",
    "one may thus hope to disentangle these contributions and test the model assumptions above and below the phase transition separately , at least qualitatively .",
    "the present scenario supports the hypothesis that the quark - gluon phase is actually reached , at a transient stage , in heavy - ion collisions at cern / sps and ( more pronouncedly ) at rhic . within our outlined approach , a purely hadronic framework would not be successful in comparison with existing data .",
    "the reason is that the relative strength of hadronic contributions to the high mass region and the low mass region is quite different as compared to those of the qgp ( cf .",
    "figure  [ results_160 ] ) .",
    "purely hadronic scenarios which are able to account for the low mass region would necessarily fail in the high mass region and vice versa . furthermore , fireball thermodynamics as described in this work leads to temperatures well above @xmath11 for a broad range of initial conditions , though not necessarily to significant contributions to the dilepton yield from the high - temperature region .",
    "the upcoming measurements at rhic can be expected to provide further interesting insights .",
    "we are grateful to ralf rapp , jochen wambach , francois arleo , alberto polleri , hans j. specht and sanja damjanovic for stimulating discussions and exchanges in the course of preparing this paper .",
    "in the following , we summarize key properties of the different fireball scenarios discussed in the paper .",
    "we characterize each scenario by the proper time for fireball formation , @xmath216 , the phase transition time @xmath316 and the freeze - out time @xmath231 .",
    "note that the corresponding times in the c.m . frame can be considerably larger , especially for rhic conditions where volume elements are travelling near the speed of light at the fireball edge .",
    "additionally , we quote the volume at freeze - out and the flow velocities at rms radius @xmath317 and maximum longitudinal extention @xmath318 . in order to compare the thermodynamic conditions , we provide @xmath319 , the entropy per baryon .",
