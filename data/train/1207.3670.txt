    "in recent times the formation of triple - helical dna has been a topic of considerable importance because of possible implications in the field of molecular biology . in 1957",
    ", it was discovered that certain sequences of watson - crick double - helical dna allow a third strand of dna to bind via hoogsteen or reverse hoogsteen base pairing to form a triple helix @xcite .",
    "this triple helix formation has the potentiality to block transcription and thereby affect gene expression .",
    "following this discovery , the experimental demonstration of the ability of a third chain to recognize the base sequences without the double - helical dna revealing the base pairs renewed the interest in triple - helix dna , especially its therapeutic applications @xcite .",
    "it is now known that not only dna but even rna @xcite and pna ( polypeptide nucleic acid ) are capable of forming a triple helix with duplex dna @xcite .",
    "three - stranded dna has been shown to exhibit an efimov - like bound state near or at the critical melting of duplex dna @xcite .",
    "the efimov effect is the most striking phenomenon to occur in quantum three - body systems with only two - body short - range pair interactions @xcite .",
    "an infinite number of bound states appear at the critical threshold of two body binding .",
    "there are several theoretical and experimental investigations using different models and methods that show this effect @xcite .",
    "the universality of this phenomenon encompasses the analogous classical model , namely , the melting of three - stranded dna @xcite . an analogy is drawn between the large quantum fluctuations near the zero - energy threshold of two - body binding and the thermal gaussian fluctuations at the melting of duplex dna . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is an exact mapping of the partition function of three ideal polymers with dna base - pairing - type short - range interaction to the green function of three - particle quantum mechanics under a transformation of the length of polymers to imaginary time .",
    "furthermore , a scaling argument was used there to justify the occurrence of the effective two - chain attractive potential @xmath0 as a source of the efimov effect .",
    "such a long - range interaction leads to a broad three - strand dna bound state at or beyond the melting point of duplex dna .",
    "this is a state where no two strands are bound but the three are bound together .",
    "we called this loosely bound state efimov dna @xcite .",
    "this has also been observed from the renormalization group ( rg ) flows and exact numerical calculations for several model systems , in particular on hierarchical lattices .",
    "hierarchical lattices , by virtue of their discrete scaling , allow one to solve many models in statistical mechanics by exact renormalization group transformations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many approximate real - space rgs on real lattices can be viewed as exact real - space rgs on hierarchical lattices . in the first study of the efimov effect for gaussian polymers , rg and exact numerics",
    "were used @xcite .",
    "a part of our aim here is to analyze the efimov phenomena exhibited by triple - stranded dna from the classical phase transition point of view , especially by looking at the zeros of the partition functions .",
    "finding the zeros of a partition function in the complex plane of any physical variable is a mathematical way to understand and analyze phase transition phenomena .",
    "however , finding those is often possible only for small sizes or soluble cases and not in general .",
    "yang and lee first studied the ising ferromagnetic system in a complex magnetic field to show that for a properly chosen variable the zeros lie on a unit circle , known as the yang - lee circle @xcite .",
    "later the zeros were studied in the complex temperature plane and other variables @xcite .",
    "since there can not be any real zero , the zeros may accumulate and pinch the real axis at a limit point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this limit point then identifies a transition point .",
    "this method can provide relevant information on phase transitions such as the critical field or temperature and the values of the associated critical exponents .",
    "moreover , the distribution of zeros may form many complicated structures other than a circle .",
    "these structures are the separatrices of the two types of flow to the two different stable fixed points of the rg transformation , and are similar to the julia sets ( see appendix [ sec : jset ] ) @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the rg flows were studied in the unbound region of the two- and the three - chain states . by looking at the flows in the unbound region of duplex dna , where the chains are supposed to be free ,",
    "an effective three - chain bound state was predicted . in this paper",
    "we study the partition function of the three - chain system by combining the recursion relations and the rg transformations , and then finding the zeros .",
    "we also extend the model to the three - chain repulsive interaction regime .",
    "in addition , we discuss several other features of the zeros in the complex plane , for instance the detailed structure , and the connection to the julia set .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the three - polymer problem on a hierarchical lattice is introduced . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , the recursion relations from rg decimation and those for exact iterations are written .",
    "the method of finding the zeros of the partition function is discussed , and we find the limit point of the zeros to locate the phase transition .",
    "section [ 23chain ] contains the results and discussions on the two- and the three - chain systems under different situations .",
    "in particular we estimate the transition point for efimov dna .",
    "section [ nuevidence ] extends the problem to three - chain repulsive interactions .",
    "the existence of a transition between the efimov dna and the critical repulsive state in higher dimensions is established there .",

    "they have a discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "that is why an exact implementation of the real space rg technique is possible .",
    "the decimation of the @xmath3 generation to arrive at the @xmath1 generation is precisely what is needed in a rg transformation .",
    "once the partition function is known , it is possible to calculate the free energy and the other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "one may even write down recursion relations for them .",
    "we consider three directed polymers on a diamond hierarchical lattice .",
    "three chains on the diamond hierarchical lattice are stretched from bottom to top , but they can wander at intermediate points .",
    "the contact energies are defined at the bonds only .",
    "the polymers are assigned attractive potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 if a single bond is shared by the two and the three polymers , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) . at each generation , the length of each polymer increases by a factor @xmath8 so that the length of polymers at the @xmath3 generation is @xmath19    for the efimov effect , just pairwise interaction is enough .",
    "however in a rg procedure it is imperative to define the model with both @xmath20 and @xmath21 , because the three - chain interaction gets generated on a longer scale .",
    "in this section we summarize the rg transformations and the exact recursion relations for the partition functions .",
    "the two ways of handling the problem are just two different ways to look at it . in the rg case , we start from a large lattice and remove short scale fluctuations by renormalizing the parameters , effectively reducing the size of the lattice .",
    "in contrast to this idea of thinning out the degrees of freedom , in the second method the lattice is built generation by generation so that one may study the behavior of any quantity of interest as a function of the length of the polymers .",
    "this is useful in studying phase transitions because finite size scaling can then be used to explore the nature of the transition .",
    "we introduce the boltzmann factors , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath25 the temperature .",
    "the rg transformations of the two - chain and the three - chain boltzmann factors are given by @xmath26 where the primed variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the left hand side represent the renormalized values of the boltzmann factors .",

    "( [ eq : ry ] ) and ( [ eq : rw ] ) would give us the phases and the nature of the transitions .",
    "one needs the fixed points for this analysis .",
    "for the two - chain system , the fixed points of @xmath31 are ( i ) @xmath33 , a stable infinite temperature fixed point representing an unbound state , and ( ii ) @xmath34 , an unstable fixed point representing the two - chain melting or critical point .",
    "in addition , ( iii ) @xmath35 ( zero temperature , representing a bound duplex state ) is an obvious stable fixed point , which does not come from the rg relation but from the rg flow . for a pure three - chain interaction ( @xmath36 )",
    "the fixed points of @xmath32 correspond to ( i ) @xmath37 , infinite temperature , ( ii ) @xmath38 , an unstable , three - chain critical point , and ( iii ) @xmath39 ( zero temperature ) , a stable fixed point , which comes from the rg flow .",
