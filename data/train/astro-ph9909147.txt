    "millisecond pulsars are characterized by short rotational periods ( @xmath7 ms ) and relatively weak surface magnetic fields ( @xmath8 g ) and are often found in binaries with a white dwarf companion .",
    "they are old neutron stars which have been recycled in a close binary via accretion of mass and angular momentum from a donor star .",
    "the general scenario of this process is fairly well understood qualitatively ( cf .",
    "review by bhattacharya & van  den  heuvel 1991 ) , but there remain many details which are still uncertain and difficult to analyze quantitatively .",
    "it is our aim to highlight these problems in a series of papers and try to answer them using detailed numerical calculations with refined stellar evolution and binary interactions .",
    "there are now more than 30 binary millisecond pulsars known in the galactic disk .",
    "they can be roughly divided into three observational classes ( tauris 1996 ) .",
    "class@xmath9a contains the wide - orbit ( @xmath10 days ) binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) with low - mass helium white dwarf companions ( @xmath11 ) , whereas the close - orbit bmsps ( @xmath12 days ) consist of systems with either low - mass helium white dwarf companions ( class@xmath9b ) or systems with relatively heavy co white dwarf companions ( class@xmath9c ) .",
    "the latter class evolved through a phase with significant loss of angular momentum ( e.g. common envelope evolution ) and descends from systems with a heavy donor star : @xmath13 .",
    "the single millisecond pulsars are believed to originate from tight class@xmath9b systems where the companion has been destroyed or evaporated  either from x - ray irradiation when the neutron star was accreting , or in the form of a pulsar radiation / wind of relativistic particles ( e.g. podsiadlowski 1991 ; tavani 1992 ) .",
    "the evolution of a binary initially consisting of a neutron star and a main - sequence companion depends on the mass of the companion ( donor ) star and the initial orbital period of the system .",
    "if the donor star is heavy compared to the neutron star then the mass transfer is likely to result in a common envelope ( ce ) evolution ( paczynski 1976 ; webbink 1984 ; iben & livio 1993 ) where the neutron star spirals in through the envelope of the donor in a very short timescale of less than @xmath14 yr .",
    "the observational paucity of roche - lobe filling companions more massive than @xmath15 has been attributed to their inability to transfer mass in a stable mode such that the system becomes a persistent long - lived x - ray source ( van  den  heuvel 1975 ; kalogera & webbink 1996 ) . for lighter donor stars ( @xmath16 )",
    "the system evolves into a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) which evolves on a much longer timescale of @xmath17 yr .",
    "it has been shown by pylyser & savonije ( 1988,1989 ) that an orbital bifurcation period ( @xmath18 ) separates the formation of converging systems ( which evolve with decreasing orbital periods until the mass - losing component becomes degenerate and an ultra - compact binary is formed ) from the diverging systems ( which finally evolve with increasing orbital periods until the mass losing star has lost its envelope and a wide detached binary is formed ) .",
    "it is the lmxbs with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 days ) which are the subject of this paper  the progenitors of the wide - orbit class@xmath9a bmsps .    in these systems",
    "the mass transfer is driven by the interior thermonuclear evolution of the companion star since it evolves into a ( sub)giant before loss of orbital angular momentum dominates . in this case",
    "we get an lmxb with a giant donor .",
    "these systems have been studied by webbink , rappaport & savonije ( 1983 ) , taam ( 1983 ) , savonije ( 1987 ) , joss , rappaport & lewis ( 1987 ) and recently rappaport  et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ergma , sarna & antipova ( 1998 ) . for a donor star on the red giant branch ( rgb ) the growth in core - mass",
    "is directly related to the luminosity , as this luminosity is entirely generated by hydrogen shell burning .",
    "as such a star , with a small compact core surrounded by en extended convective envelope , is forced to move up the hayashi track its luminosity increases strongly with only a fairly modest decrease in temperature .",
    "hence one also finds a relationship between the giant s radius and the mass of its degenerate helium core  almost entirely independent of the mass present in the hydrogen - rich envelope ( refsdal & weigert 1971 ; webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ) . in the scenario under consideration ,",
    "the extended envelope of the giant is expected to fill its roche - lobe until termination of the mass transfer .",
    "since the roche - lobe radius @xmath21 only depends on the masses and separation between the two stars it is clear that the core - mass , from the moment the star begins roche - lobe overflow , is uniquely correlated with the orbital period of the system .",
    "thus also the final orbital period , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 days ) is expected to be a function of the mass of the resulting white dwarf companion ( savonije 1987 ) .",
    "it has also been argued that the core - mass determines the rate of mass transfer ( webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ) . for a general overview of the evolution of lmxbs ",
    "see e.g. verbunt ( 1990 ) .",
    "+ in this study we also discuss the final post - accretion mass of the neutron star and confront it with observations and the consequences of the new theory for kaon condensation in the core of neutron stars which result in a very soft equation - of - state and a corresponding maximum neutron star mass of only @xmath24 ( brown & bethe 1994 ) .    in section  2",
    "we briefly introduce the code , and in sections  3 and 4 we outline the orbital evolution and the stability criteria for mass transfer .",
    "we present the results of our lmxb calculations in section  5 and in section  6 we discuss our results and compare with observations .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  7 and a summary table of our numerical calculations is presented in the appendix .",
    "we have used an updated version of the numerical stellar evolution code of eggleton .",
    "this code uses a self - adaptive , non - lagrangian mesh - spacing which is a function of local pressure , temperature , lagrangian mass and radius .",
    "it treats both convective and semi - convective mixing as a diffusion process and finds a simultaneous and implicit solution of both the stellar structure equations and the diffusion equations for the chemical composition .",
    "new improvements are the inclusion of pressure ionization and coulomb interactions in the equation - of - state , and the incorporation of recent opacity tables , nuclear reaction rates and neutrino loss rates .",
    "the most important recent updates of this code are described in pols  et  al .",
    "( 1995;@xmath91998 ) and some are summarized in han , podsiadlowski & eggleton ( 1994 ) . + we performed such detailed numerical stellar evolution calculations in our work since they should result in more realistic results compared to models based on complete , composite or condensed polytropes .",
    "we have included a number of binary interactions in this code in order to carefully follow the details of the mass - transfer process in lmxbs .",
    "these interactions include losses of orbital angular momentum due to mass loss , magnetic braking , gravitational wave radiation and the effects of tidal interactions and irradiation of the donor star by hard photons from the accreting neutron star .",
    "the orbital angular momentum for a circular yr , cf .",
    "verbunt & phinney ( 1995 ) .",
    "] binary is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the separation between the stellar components , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses of the ( accreting ) neutron star and the companion ( donor ) star , respectively , @xmath29 and the orbital angular velocity , @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the constant of gravity .",
    "a simple logarithmic differentiation of this equation yields the rate of change in orbital separation : @xmath32 where the total change in orbital angular momentum is : @xmath33 the first term on the right side of this equation gives the change in orbital angular momentum due to gravitational wave radiation ( landau & lifshitz 1958 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the second term arises due to magnetic braking .",
    "this is is a combined effect of a magnetically coupled stellar wind and tidal spin - orbit coupling which tend to keep the donor star spinning synchronously with the orbital motion .",
    "observations of low - mass dwarf stars with rotational periods in the range of @xmath36 days ( skumanich 1972 ) show that even a weak ( solar - like ) wind will slow down their rotation in the course of time due to interaction of the stellar wind with the magnetic field induced by the differential rotation in the convective envelope . for a star in a close binary system ,",
    "the rotational braking is compensated by tidal coupling so that orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum and the binary orbit shrinks .",
    "based on this observed braking law correlation between rotational period and age , verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) estimated the braking torque and we find : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radius of the donor star , @xmath39 is its moment of inertia and @xmath40 is a constant of order unity ( see also discussion by rappaport , verbunt & joss 1983 ) . in order to sustain a significant surface magnetic field we required a minimum depth of @xmath41 for the convective envelope ( cf .",
    "pylyser & savonije 1988 and references therein ) .",
    "since the magnetic field is believed to be anchored in the underlaying radiative layers of the star ( parker 1955 ) , we also required a maximum depth of the convection zone : @xmath42 in order for the process of magnetic braking to operate .",
    "these limits imply that magnetic braking operates in low - mass ( @xmath43 ) stars which are not too evolved .    the third term on the right side of eq .",
    "( 3 ) describes possible exchange of angular momentum between the orbit and the donor star due to its expansion or contraction . for both this term and the magnetic braking term we estimate whether or not the tidal torque is sufficiently strong to keep the donor star synchronized with the orbit .",
    "the tidal torque is determined by considering the effect of turbulent viscosity in the convective envelope of the donor on the equilibrium tide .",
    "when the donor star approaches its roche - lobe tidal effects become strong and lead to synchronous rotation .",
    "the corresponding tidal energy dissipation rate was calculated and taken into account in the local energy balance of the star .",
    "the tidal dissipation term was distributed through the convective envelope according to the local mixing - length approximation for turbulent convection  see appendix for further details .",
    "since we present calculations here for systems with @xmath44 days , the most significant contribution to the overall change in orbital angular momentum is caused by loss of mass from the system .",
    "this effect is given by : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the mass ratio of the donor over the accretor and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the fractions of mass lost from the donor in the form of a fast wind , the mass ejected from the vicinity of the neutron star and from a circumstellar coplanar toroid ( with radius , @xmath50 ) , respectively  see van  den  heuvel ( 1994a ) and soberman , phinney & van  den  heuvel ( 1997 ) .",
    "the accretion efficiency of the neutron star is thus given by : @xmath51 , or equivalently : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "note , that these factors will also be functions of time as the binary evolve .",
    "low - mass ( @xmath54 ) donor stars do not lose any significant amount material in the form of a direct wind ",
    "except for an irradiated donor in a very close binary system , or an extended giant donor evolving toward the tip of the rgb which loses a significant amount of material in a wind .",
    "for the latter type of donors we used reimers ( 1975 ) formula to calculate the wind mass - loss rate : @xmath55 where the mass , radius and luminosity are in solar units and @xmath56 is the mass - loss parameter .",
    "we assumed @xmath57 for our work  cf .",
    "renzini ( 1981 ) and sackmann , boothroyd & kraemer ( 1993 ) for discussions .",
    "the mass - loss mechanism involving a circumstellar toroid drains far too much orbital angular momentum from the lmxb and would be dynamical unstable resulting in a runaway event and formation of a ce .",
    "also the existence of binary radio pulsars with orbital periods of several hundred days exclude this scenario as being dominant .",
    "+ hence , for most of the work in this paper we have @xmath58 , and we shall assume @xmath59 , and for lmxbs with large mass - transfer rates the mode of mass transfer to consider is therefore the `` isotropic re - emission '' model . in this model all of the matter flows over , in a conservative way , from the donor star to an accretion disk in the vicinity of the neutron star , and",
    "then a fraction , @xmath48 of this material is ejected isotropically from the system with the specific orbital angular momentum of the neutron star .",
    "as mentioned above , since we present calculations here for systems with initial periods larger than 2 days , loss of angular momentum due to gravitational wave radiation and magnetic braking ( requiring orbital synchronization ) will in general not be very significant .",
    "for every timestep in the evolution calculation of the donor star the mass - transfer rate is calculated from the boundary condition on the stellar mass : @xmath60 ^ 3          \\qquad \\mbox{$m_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$}\\ ] ] where @xmath61=0.5\\,[x+abs(x)]$ ] and @xmath21 is the donor s roche - radius given by ( eggleton 1983 ) : @xmath62 the orbital separation @xmath26 follows from the orbital angular momentum balance  see eqs  ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "all these variables are included in a henyey iteration scheme .",
    "the above expression for the mass - transfer rate is rather arbitrary , as is the precise amount of roche - lobe overfill for a certain transfer rate ; but the results are independent of the precise form as they are determined by the response of the stellar radius to mass loss .",
    "the stability and nature of the mass transfer is very important in binary stellar evolution .",
    "it depends on the response of the mass - losing donor star and of the roche - lobe  see soberman , phinney & van  den  heuvel ( 1997 ) for a nice review . if the mass transfer proceeds on a short timescale ( thermal or dynamical ) the system is unlikely to be observed during this short phase , whereas if the mass transfer proceeds on a nuclear timescale it is still able to sustain a high enough accretion rate onto the neutron star for the system to be observable as an lmxb for an appreciable interval of time .",
    "when the donor evolves to fill its roche - lobe ( or alternatively , the binary shrinks sufficiently as a result of orbital angular momentum losses ) the unbalanced pressure at the first lagrangian point will initiate mass transfer ( roche - lobe overflow , rlo ) onto the neutron star .",
    "when the donor star is perturbed by removal of some mass , it falls out of hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium . in the process of re - establishing equilibrium ,",
    "the star will either grow or shrink  first on a dynamical ( sound crossing ) , and then on a slower thermal ( heat diffusion , or kelvin - helmholtz ) timescale .",
    "also the roche - lobe changes in response to the mass transfer / loss .",
    "as long as the donor star s roche - lobe continues to enclose the star the mass transfer is stable .",
    "otherwise it is unstable and proceeds on a dynamical timescale .",
    "hence the question of stability is determined by a comparison of the exponents in power - law fits of radius to mass , @xmath63 , for the donor star and the roche - lobe , respectively : @xmath64 where @xmath38 and @xmath28 refer to the mass losing donor star . given @xmath65 ( the condition at the onset of rlo )",
    "the initial stability criterion becomes : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the adiabatic or thermal ( or somewhere in between ) response of the donor star to mass loss .",
    "note , that the stability might change during the mass - transfer phase so that initially stable systems become unstable , or vice versa , later in the evolution .",
    "the radius of the donor is a function of time and mass and thus : @xmath68 @xmath69 the second terms follow from eq .",
    "( 11 ) ; the first term of eq .",
    "( 13 ) is due to expansion of the donor star as a result of nuclear burning ( e.g. shell hydrogen burning on the rgb ) and the first term of eq .",
    "( 14 ) represents changes in @xmath21 which are not caused by mass transfer such as orbital decay due to gravitational wave radiation and tidal spin - orbit coupling .",
    "tidal coupling tries to synchronize the orbit whenever the rotation of the donor is perturbed ( e.g. as a result of magnetic braking or an increase of the moment of inertia while the donor expands ) . the mass - loss rate of the donor can be found as a self - consistent solution to eqs  ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) assuming @xmath70 for stable mass transfer .      for binaries with orbital periods larger than a few days",
    "it is a good approximation that @xmath72 and @xmath58 during the rlo mass - transfer phase .",
    "assuming @xmath73 and @xmath74 we can therefore use the analytical expression obtained by tauris ( 1996 ) for an integration of eq .  ( 2 ) to calculate the change in orbital separation during the lmxb phase ( assuming a constant @xmath48 ) : @xmath75 where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes initial values . here",
    "we have added an extra factor , @xmath76 : @xmath77 to account for the tidal spin - orbit coupling since @xmath78 .",
    "one aim of this study is to evaluate the deviation of @xmath76 from unity .",

    "we note that @xmath71 does not depend strongly on @xmath48 .",
    "this figure is quite useful to get an idea of the stability of a given mass transfer when comparing with @xmath85 for the donor star .",
    "we see that in general the roche - lobe , @xmath21 increases ( @xmath86 ) when material is transferred from a light donor to a heavier ns ( @xmath87 ) and correspondingly @xmath21 decreases ( @xmath88 ) when material is transferred from a heavier donor to a lighter ns ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this behavior is easily understood from the bottom panel of the same figure where we have plotted @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "the sign of this quantity is important since it tells whether the orbit expands or contracts in response to mass transfer ( note @xmath92 ) .",
    "we notice that the orbit always expands when @xmath87 and it always decreases when @xmath93 , whereas for @xmath94 it can still expand if @xmath95 .",
    "there is a point at @xmath96 where @xmath97 is independent of @xmath48 .",
    "it should be mentioned that if @xmath95 then , in some cases , it is actually possible to decrease the separation , @xmath26 between two stellar components while increasing @xmath98 at the same time !",

    "note , that we have zoomed in on the age interval which corresponds to the mass - transfer phase . as an example , we have chosen two different initial donor masses ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 )  each with two different initial orbital periods ( 3.0 and 60.0 days ) of the neutron star ( ns ) and its zams companion .",

    "is lost from the donor ( and the system ) in only a few @xmath174 yr .",
    "the system survives and the orbital period increases from 54.5 days to 111 days during this short phase .",
    "+ after this extremely short mass - transfer epoch , with an ultra - high mass - transfer rate , the donor star relaxes ( @xmath121 ) and shrink inside its roche - lobe for 2.5 myr when @xmath175 .",
    "the mass transfer is resumed again for 7.5 myr at a more moderate super - eddington rate ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the final outcome is a binary pulsar with a @xmath176 he - wd companion and an orbital period of 608 days .",
    "though the ns only accretes @xmath177 as a result of the short integrated accretion phase it will probably be spun - up sufficiently to become a millisecond pulsar since millisecond pulsars evidently are also formed in systems which evolve e.g. through a ce with similar ( or even shorter ) phases of accretion ( van  den  heuvel 1994b ) .",
    "+ the initial extreme evolution of this system causes an offset in @xmath85 until the more moderate mass - transfer phase ( @xmath151 ) continues at @xmath175 .",
    "it should be noted that a system like this is very unlikely to be observed in the ultra - high mass - transfer state due to the very short interval ( @xmath178 yr ) of this phase .",
    "the latter example above illustrates very well the situation near the threshold for unstable mass transfer on a dynamical timescale and the onset of a ce evolution .",
    "if the donor star is heavier than @xmath180 a critical overflow is likely to occur since the orbit shrinks in response to mass transfer ( @xmath181 , cf .",
    "section  4 ) .",
    "this is also the situation if @xmath98 is large because the donor in that case develops a deep convective envelope which causes it to expand in response to mass loss and a runaway mass transfer sets in . when a runaway mass transfer sets in we were not able to prevent it from critically overflowing its roche - lobe and our code breaks down . at this stage",
    "the neutron star is eventually embedded in a ce with its companion and it will spiral in toward the center of its companion as a result of removal of orbital angular momentum by the drag force acting on it might survive the mass transfer avoiding a spiral - in phase in case the envelope of the donor is still radiative at the onset of the rlo . ] .",
    "the final result of the ce depends mainly on the orbital period and the mass of the giant s envelope .",
    "if there is enough orbital energy available ( i.e. if @xmath98 is large enough at the onset of the ce ) , then the entire envelope of the giant can be expelled as a result of the liberated orbital energy , which is converted into kinetic energy that provides an outward motion of the envelope decoupling it from its core .",
    "this leaves behind a tight binary with a heavy wd ( the core of the giant ) and a moderately recycled pulsar .",
    "there are five such systems observed in our galaxy .",
    "they all have a co - wd and @xmath182 days .",
    "these are the so - called class@xmath9c bmsps .",
    "+ if there is not enough orbital energy available to expel the envelope , then the ns spirals in completely to the center of the giant and a thorne - ytkow object is formed .",
    "such an object might evolve into a single millisecond pulsar ( e.g. van  den  heuvel 1994a ) or may collapse into a black hole ( chevalier 1996 ) .",
    "we have derived new ( @xmath183 ) correlations based on the outcome of the 121 lmxb models calculated for this work .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "4a ( the top panel ) .",
    "we considered models with donor star masses ( @xmath28 ) in the interval @xmath0 , chemical compositions ranging from population  i ( x=0.70 , z=0.02 ) to population  ii ( x=0.75 , z=0.001 ) and convective mixing - length parameters @xmath184 from 23 ( here @xmath185 is the mixing length and @xmath186 is the local pressure scaleheight ) .",

    "thick line in fig .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath28 is set by the requirement that the mass transfer in the binary must be dynamically stable , and the lower limit by the requirement that the donor star must evolve off the main sequence within an interval of time given by : @xmath189 . here",
    "@xmath190 gyr is the age of the universe , @xmath191 gyr is the minimum time between the big  bang and formation of our milky way and @xmath192 gyr is a typical low value of wd companion cooling ages , following the mass - transfer phase , as observed in bmsps ( hansen & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "we thus find @xmath193 as a conservative lower limit .",
    "the first thing to notice , is that the correlation is more or less independent of the initial donor star mass ( @xmath28 )  only for @xmath194 ( where the mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable anyway for @xmath195 days ) we see a slight deviation .",
    "this result is expected if @xmath196 ( and therefore @xmath38 and @xmath98 ) is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "we have performed a check on this statement using our calculations for an evolved donor star on the rgb . as an example , in table  1 we have written @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath196 as a function of @xmath28 when it has evolved to a radius of @xmath199 .",
