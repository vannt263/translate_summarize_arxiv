    "[ fig8](c ) shows the calculated schottky heat capacity , thus validating our crystal field splitting estimation from the susceptibility data .",
    "the discrepacy above 50  k ma be attributed to the difference in the phonon spectra of lapd@xmath0ge@xmath0 and cepd@xmath0ge@xmath0 at higher temperatures .",
    "the application of magnetic field shifts the antiferromagnetic ordering to lower temperatures which is more prominent along the [ 100 ] direction than along the [ 001 ] direction , as evident from the magnetic phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "the low value of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath14 ( 9.2  mj / k@xmath58mol ) in cepd@xmath0ge@xmath0 which is comprable to that of lapd@xmath0ge@xmath0 indicates that the hybridization between the conduction electron and the @xmath4 electron is weak and the @xmath4 electrons are highly localized here .",

    "[ fig6](b ) that the @xmath68 increases to a large value in the magnetic field when the antiferromagnetic ordering vanishes , and is attributed to the spin fluctuations . the enhancement in the @xmath68 value , when the antiferromagnetic ordering vanishes due to the application of magnetic field is also observed in ceausb@xmath0 , which shows a field induced quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see the effect of magnetic field on the electrical resistivity of cepd@xmath0ge@xmath0 , down to very low temperature , which is planned for the future .",

    "the phase purity and the crystal composition was confirmed by x - ray diffraction and edax .",
    "the transport and magnetic properties have revealed large anistropy along the two principal crystallographic directions viz . , [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] , reflecting the tetragonal crystal structure . the antiferromagnetic order is confirmed as @xmath15 = 5.1  k. the electrical resistivity in the ordered state can be well explained by the spin - wave gap model .",
    "the nel temperature was found to decrease with increasing field , as expected for a typical antiferromagnet system . for fields greater than 13  t , the magnetic ordering was found to vanish .",
    "our crystal field calculation clearly explain the anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization and the energy level thus obtained for the first and second excited state was found to be 120  k and 230  k. these energy levels clearly explained the schottky anomaly in the magnetic part of the heat capacity .",
    "the jump in the magnetic part of the heat capacity was found to 12.5  j / k mol as expected by the mean field model for a spin 1/2 system .",
    "there was no signature of kondo effect and the magnetic ordering in this system is believed to be purely ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type interaction .",
    "one of the interesting findings is that although the magnetization is larger along the [ 001 ] direction as observed experimentally and supported by the cef calculation , the moment direction is orthogonal to it , oriented in the @xmath20-plane .",
