    "<S> actually , regarding the back reaction effects , one can argue that a black hole stops radiations at the planck mass @xmath9 , where the radiated energy is comparable to the black hole s mass , since a black hole can not radiate more energy than it has , via the pair creation process near the black hole horizon . </S>",

    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to consider an exact classical solution , as an explicit example , which represents nicely those two properties in a recently proposed quantum gravity model , known as hoava gravity , based on different scaling dimensions between space and time coordinates . </S>",

    "<S> the black hole state becomes thermodynamically stable as it approaches to the merge point where the interior wormhole throat and the black hole horizon merges , and the hawking temperature vanishes at the exact merge point ( with @xmath6 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> are quite distinct objects due to their completely different causal structures . </S>",
    "<S> but the claimed  generalized cosmic censorship \" suggests that the end state of a black hole is a wormhole , not a naked singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this may correspond to a foam - like nature of space - time at short length scales . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one could understand the would - be wormhole inside the black hole horizon as the results of microscopic wormholes created by  negative \" energy quanta which have entered the black hole horizon in hawking radiation processes so that _ the quantum black hole could be a wormhole factory . </S>",
    "<S> _ it is found that this speculative picture may be consistent with the recent  @xmath7 \" proposal for resolving the black hole entanglement debates .    to see how this picture can arise explicitly , we consider the hoava gravity which has been proposed as a four - dimensional , renormalizable , higher - derivative quantum gravity without ghost problems , by adopting different scaling dimensions for space and time coordinates in uv ( ultraviolet ) energy regime , @xmath11=-1 , [ { \\bf x}]=-z$ ] with the dynamical critical exponents @xmath12 ,  at the expense of lorentz invariance \" hora . </S>",
    "<S> we formally define the quantum gravity by a path integral    z = e^is/    with the proposed action ( @xmath13 is considered , for simplicity ) , up to the surface terms ,    s & = & dt d^3 x n  , [ horava ]    and with the adm decomposition of the metric ,    ds^2=-n^2 c^2 dt^2+g_ij(dx^i+n^i dt)(dx^j+n^j dt ) ,    the extrinsic curvature ,    k_ij=(_ij-_i n_j-_jn_i ) ,    the cotton tensor ,    c^ij=^ik_k ( r^(3)j_-r^(3 ) ^j _ )  ,    and coupling constants , @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> the proposed action is not the most general form for a power - counting renormalizable gravity , compatible with the assumed foliation preserving _ diff _ but it is general enough to contain all the known gr solutions , and the qualitative features of the solutions are expected to be similar lu , keha , park , kiri . here , originally , </S>",
    "<S> the _ non - relativistic _ higher - derivative deformations were introduced from the technical reason of the necessity of renormalizable interactions without the ghost problem which exists in relativistic higher - derivative theories hora . </S>",
    "<S> but we further remark that , which has not been well emphasized before , the ( uv ) lorentz violation _ </S>",
    "<S> might _ have a more fundamental reason in our quantum gravity set - up since this may be consistent with the existence of the absolute minimum length @xmath10 which does not depend on the reference frames , violating the usual _ relativistic _ length contraction .     in hoava gravity for varying @xmath2 with a fixed @xmath3 ( left ) and for varying @xmath3 with a fixed @xmath2 ( right ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> in the left we consider @xmath15 ( top to bottom solid curves ) with @xmath16 , and in the right @xmath17 ( top to bottom solid curves ) with @xmath18 , in contrast with schwarzschild solution for @xmath18 in gr ( dotted curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]   in hoava gravity for varying @xmath2 with a fixed @xmath3 ( left ) and for varying @xmath3 with a fixed @xmath2 ( right ) . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ , non - rotating , uncharged black holes , where only the last three terms in the action ( [ horava ] ) are relevant , the exact solutions have been found completely for arbitrary values of coupling constants , @xmath19 , and @xmath3 lu , keha , park , kiri . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the present purpose we only consider a simple example of @xmath20 ,    ds^2=-n(r)^2 c^2 dt^2++r^2 ( d^2+^2d^2 ) [ bh1 ]    with    n^2=f=1+r^2- [ bh2 ]    so that the standard einstein - hilbert action and the asymptotically flat , schwarzschild black hole solution are recovered in the ir limit , _ </S>",

    "<S> one remarkable property of the solution is that there is an inner horizon @xmath26 as well as the outer horizon @xmath27 , which solves @xmath28 , at    r _ = m ( 1 )    as the result of higher ( spatial ) derivatives ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) : the higher derivative terms act like some ( non - relativistic ) effective matters in the conventional einstein equation so that there is some  repulsive \" interaction at short distances . moreover , even though the metric converges to the minkowski s flat space - time at the origin @xmath29 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath30 , its derivative is not continuous so that there is a curvature singularity at @xmath29 , which may be captured by the singularity of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> so , even though the singularity at @xmath29 is a time - like line ( _ i.e. _ , time - like singularity ) and is milder than that of schwarzschild black hole , @xmath32 ( and also reissner - nordstrm s @xmath33 ) and surrounded by the ( two ) horizons provided    m^2 12 ,    this might indicate that the proposed gravity does not completely resolve the singularity problem of gr still , classically .    </S>",
    "<S> this circumstance looks inconsistent with the cosmology solution , where the initial singularity does not exist whence there exist the higher - derivative effects , _ i.e. _ , non - flat universes keha , park . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the black hole singularity becomes naked for @xmath5 so that the cosmic censorship might not work in this edge of solution space , even if @xmath2 is positive definite .    </S>",
    "<S> but according to recent bottacantcheff - grandi - sturla ( bgs ) s construction of wormholes , it seems that there is another possibility for resolving the unsatisfactory circumstance ca nt . </S>",
    "<S> what they found was that there exits a wormhole solution also , in addition to the naked singularity solution for @xmath5 , without introducing additional ( exotic ) matters at the throat . </S>",
    "<S> their obtained wormhole solution    ds^2=-n_(r)^2 c^2 dt^2++r^2 ( d^2+^2d^2 ) [ wormhole ]    with    n_^2=f_=1 + _ r^2- [ wormhole2 ]    is made of two coordinate patches , each one covering the range @xmath34 in one universe and the two patches joining at the wormhole throat @xmath35 , which is defined as the minimum of the radial coordinate @xmath36 .    in the conventional approach for ( traversable ) wormholes , there are basically two unsatisfactory features morr , viss . </S>",
    "<S> first , we do not know much about the mechanism for a wormhole formation . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the black hole case , where the gravitational collapse of ordinary matters , like stars , can form a black hole , if its mass is enough . </S>",
    "<S> second , the usual steps of ` constructing ' wormholes are too artificial as summarized by the following three steps : ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> prepare two or several universes ; ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> connect the universes by cut and paste of their throats ; ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> put the needed  </S>",
    "<S> exotic \" matters , which violate the energy conditions , to the throats so that einstein s equations are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the new approach , the problem of artificiality of a wormhole construction is avoided by observing that the solution is smoothly joined at the throat , so that the additional compensating ( singular or non - singular ) matters are not needed , if the metric and its derivatives are continuous at the throat . </S>",
    "<S> but , if we further consider the reflection symmetric two universes , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , the only possible way of smooth patching at the throat is ) is not always necessary for @xmath39 but more general class of wormhole solutions could be possible . </S>",
    "<S> but , this is only for the case of singular , @xmath40-function discontinuities in the equations of motions . </S>",
    "<S> whereas , for the non - singular discontinuities at the throat , which can not be properly treated in the bgs s analysis , the condition ( [ junction ] ) is still essential for our wormhole construction . ]    </S>",
    "<S> .df_dr|_r_0 = 0 [ junction ]    and the throat radius is obtained as    r_0=(m2 ) ^1/3 .    here , it is important to note that the throat is located always inside the black hole horizon , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath41 for @xmath4 so that it is unobservable to an outer observer , whereas the wormhole throat emerges for @xmath5 , instead of a naked singularity ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . for a fixed @xmath3 , the throat radius , after emerging from the coincidence with the extremal black hole radius , @xmath42 , decreases monotonically as @xmath2 decreases and finally vanishes for @xmath43 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , minkowski vacuum ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , left ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the situation that has been assumed in bgs s paper ca nt . </S>",
    "<S> but , on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath2 and varying @xmath3 , one finds that the throat radius increases again indefinitely as @xmath3 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the wormhole size can be quite large when the coupling constant @xmath3 , which could flow under renormalization group , becomes smaller at quantum gravity regime , like the planck size black hole or wormhole ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , right ) . </S>",
    "<S> cai , rather than another form of an integration constant @xmath44 lu , park ] in the actual quantum gravity process , like black hole evaporations , @xmath2 , due to hawking radiations , as well as @xmath3 , due to renormalization group flow with the change of energy scales , can vary so that we need to consider some combinations of situations of the left and right in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this is similar to the einstein - rosen bridge eins but the difference is that the throat may not coincide with the black hole horizon generally in the present case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the present case the throat is located at the fixed  time \" @xmath35 so that any time - like trajectories should meet the throat if exits ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the black hole solution ( [ wormhole ] ) , ( [ wormhole2 ] ) with the  time - like \" throat for @xmath4 should be considered as a physically distinct object from the black hole solution ( [ bh1 ] ) , ( [ bh2 ] ) having the ( hidden ) singularity at @xmath29 . and </S>",
    "<S> in order to avoid a rather strange situation that the wormhole throat  suddenly \" emerges from the extremal black hole which has a singularity at @xmath29 still , it would be _ natural _ to consider the time - like throat in ( [ wormhole ] ) , ( [ wormhole2 ] ) for @xmath4 as the  would - be \" wormhole throat . in order </S>",
    "<S> to be distinguished from the usual black hole solution ( [ bh1 ] ) , ( [ bh2 ] ) , we may call the solution ( [ wormhole ] ) , ( [ wormhole2 ] ) as the  black wormhole \" solution .     </S>",

    "<S> the arrows represent the time - like geodesics inside the horizons . </S>",
    "<S> , width=453 ]    now , we have a completely regular vacuum solution , without the curvature singularities , which interpolates between the black hole state for @xmath4 and wormhole state for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to support wheeler s foam picture of the quantum space - time in quantum gravity but as a real static , not as a virtual time - dependent , wormhole . </S>",
    "<S> and in our quantum gravity theory , where the concept of horizon emerges at low energies , escaping the horizons is not impossible for high energy particles with lorentz - violating dispersion relations . </S>",
    "<S> but for low energy point of view , without probing the interior structure of real black holes , the observable consequences of the black wormhole solution would be expressed in the form of a  </S>",
    "<S> generalized cosmic censorship \" , suggesting that  the naked singularity does not appear still by forming wormholes even after the horizons disappear in quantum gravity \" though , before evaporation , there would be no naked singularity by the existence of horizons as usual .    </S>",
    "<S> another important new implication of the black wormhole solution to low energy observers is that there would be transformations between black holes and wormholes , which is known to be impossible in gr , due to the no - go theorem for topology change gero . in other words , once a ( primordial ) wormhole is formed in the quantum gravity regime , due to quantum fluctuation in the early universe , it may evolve into a black hole state by the combinations of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( right ) from renormalization group flows to gr and fig . 2 ( left ) from accretion of matters </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see whether this could be a mechanism for the primordial black holes and supermassive black holes , which are believed to be formed very early in the universe and distinguished from the stellar - mass black holes which are ( or believed to be ) generated from collapsing stars .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , according to the black wormhole solution , once a black hole is formed in our quantum gravity , it always has the would - be wormhole inside the horizon but this inside wormhole is exposed to outer observers when the horizon disappears after the complete evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> but we know that the inside wormhole is absent in the gr limit , as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( right ) . then , where does the inside wormhole come from in quantum gravity regime ? this is the question about the physical mechanism of a wormhole formation , which has been lacking . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the only possible answer to this question could be found in the hawking radiation process , which involves virtual pairs of particles near the event horizon , one of the pair enters into the black hole while the other escapes : the escaped particle is observed as a real particle with a _ positive _ energy with respect to an observer at infinity and then , the absorbed particle must have a _ negative _ energy in order that the energy is conserved hawk . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the negative energy particles that fall into black hole could be an  </S>",
    "<S> exotic matter \" source for a wormhole formation inside the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> but one can easily discover that this would be quite implausible in gr since negative masses ( or energies ) repel ( _ i.e. _ , produce the outward accelerations of ) , as positive masses attract ( _ i.e. _ , produce the inward accelerations of ) , all other bodies regardless of their ( positive or negative ) masses from the _ equivalence principle_. we have never observed the negative mass object yet and it could produce some strange phenomena , known as  the runaway motion \" of a pair of positive and negative mass particles , but the repulsive nature of gravity for negative masses is another remarkable consequence of gr bond . in the language of the newtonian approximation , where the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric body is given by @xmath46 , that property is indicated by the fact that @xmath47 , which is related to the ( radial ) acceleration @xmath48 , is always positive for the potential of a positive mass @xmath49 , whereas @xmath47 is always negative for the potential of a negative mass @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this property implies that negative mass could not form a ( stable ) structure , _ </S>",
    "<S> naturally_. this could explain why it would not be possible to form a wormhole by collapsing of exotic matters , in particular , negative energy matters , including the negative energy particles that fall into black hole in gr , in contrast to the case of a black hole formation . actually , previously the negative energy particle has been thought to result in just reducing the black hole mass by some compensation process with positive energy sources , which may exist inside the horizon , for the positive black hole mass .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation is quite different in our quantum gravity context , where the gravity becomes weaker at short distance and changes its ( attractive or repulsive ) nature after passing the surface of @xmath51 , which we call the  zero - gravity surface \" for convenience . in other words , for the positive black hole mass @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , the gravity becomes repulsive inside the zero - gravity surface ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , solid curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> this now implies that even the positive mass could not form a structure _ inside the zero - gravity surface _ , naturally , in contrast to the outside the zero - gravity surface where the its gravity is still attractive so that a stable structure can be formed , as in gr .     in hoava gravity for varying @xmath2 with a fixed @xmath3 ( left ) and for varying @xmath3 with a fixed @xmath2 ( right ) . in particular , in the left we consider @xmath52 ( bottom to top solid curves ) with @xmath53 , and in the right @xmath54 ( bottom to top solid curves ) with @xmath55 , in contrast with the negative mass schwarzschild solution for @xmath55 in gr ( dotted curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]   in hoava gravity for varying @xmath2 with a fixed @xmath3 ( left ) and for varying @xmath3 with a fixed @xmath2 ( right ) . in particular , in the left we consider @xmath52 ( bottom to top solid curves ) with @xmath53 , and in the right @xmath54 ( bottom to top solid curves ) with @xmath55 , in contrast with the negative mass schwarzschild solution for @xmath55 in gr ( dotted curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    in order to see how this problem could be resolved dramatically by the negative masses in our quantum gravity context , we now turn to consider the _ negative mass _ solution in hoava gravity , which has never been studied in the literature . in order to find a negative mass solution </S>",
    "<S> , one might first try to consider @xmath50 for the solution ( 7 ) but one can easily find that this could not be the right solution : the solution is _ not defined _ below a certain radius , where the quantity inside the square root become zero for @xmath56 or shows a different asymptotic ( @xmath57 ) behavior , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ not asymptotically flat , @xmath58 , for @xmath59 . however , by noting that the solution of the metric ansatz ( 6 ) is unique up to the ( @xmath60 ) sign in front of the square root in ( 7 ) generally , we find that the negative mass solution as    n^2=f=1+r^2  + \" [ negative_m ]    for the different sign of the square root term , compared to the solution ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this solution recovers the schwarzschild solution in the ir limit for @xmath59 , as ( 7 ) does for @xmath49 and @xmath56 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) ; for @xmath56 , the solution ( 14 ) neither recovers the schwarzschild solution nor the metric is defined for the whole space region . [ </S>",
    "<S> but in this case , in order that gr is recovered , we need to consider @xmath61 as in asymptotically de sitter space park and we will discuss about this again later ]    one can prove that the new solution ( 14 ) does not have horizons , as can be easily observed in fig . 4 also but it has a curvature singularity at @xmath29 , where the metric is finite but discontinuous , with the same degrees of divergences as the solution ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , this solution itself represents a naked singularity as the negative mass schwarzschild solution does in gr . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this may be one of main obstacle for considering the negative mass solution as a viable solution in gr and this is not much improved for the solution ( 14 ) alone , in our hoava gravity context .    </S>",
    "<S> but , as in the positive mass case , we have another ( exact ) solution of a wormhole , for the reflection symmetric two universes , with the same formula ( 13 ) for the throat @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , in hoava gravity , there exists a regular , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , singularity free _ , negative mass solution so that it could be viable but only in the form of a wormhole geometry . </S>",
    "<S> but here we will not consider about the negative mass wormhole solution further since its formation mechanism is unclear at present .    </S>",
    "<S> rather , we consider the negative mass solution ( 14 ) in order to see how does the negative masses , like the negative energy particles that fall into black hole could interact and form a structure , like the ( black ) wormhole with a positive mass . actually , the solution ( 14 ) indicates that the gravity of a negative mass is repulsive at large distance but becomes weaker , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , less - repulsive , at short distance and moreover becomes attractive inside the zero - gravity surface of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the negative masses could form a structure naturally , at short distance inside the zero - gravity surface , in contrast to the case of positive masses which could not form a structure inside their _ own _ zero - gravity surface as we have explained already . </S>",
    "<S> this is the remarkable consequence of hoava gravity which could justify our picture that _ wormholes are created and sustained by the continuous inflow of negative energy particles via the hawking radiation process _ , which is impossible in gr . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main claim of this paper and in a more compact form , this can be expressed as : _ the quantum black hole could be a wormhole factory ! _    interestingly , this may provide a physical origin of the einstein - rosen bridge in the recent  @xmath7 \" proposal for resolving the issue of entanglement in a black hole spacetime mald claiming that  the black hole and its hawking radiation are entangled via einstein - rosen bridges \" ( fig . 5 ) . following their proposal , one could understand the would - be wormholes inside the black hole horizon as the results of microscopic wormholes created by negative energy quanta which have entered the black hole horizon but entangled with its hawking radiated , positive energy , partner quanta , which now lives in a single universe , widely separated from its mother black hole </S>",
    "<S> . this may be consistent with our reflection symmetric configuration , but it is not clear how to extend this picture to more general configurations which can not be interpreted as a configuration in a single universe . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is not clear either how the throats of einstein - rosen s bridges evolve into our would - be wormhole in detail .        in conclusion , we have considered a vacuum and static _ black wormhole _ solution which is regular , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , singularity - free , and interpolates between the black hole state for @xmath4 and wormhole state for @xmath5 through the coincidence state of an extremal black hole and a ( kind of ) einstein - rosen bridge for @xmath6 . from this </S>",
    "<S> , we have suggested the transformation between the black hole and wormhole states , and its resulting generalized cosmic censorship . and </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have argued that the would - be wormholes inside the black hole horizon could be understood as the results of microscopic wormholes created by  negative \" energy quanta which have entered the black hole horizon in hawking radiation processes so that _ the quantum black hole could be a wormhole factory . _    but then ,  can the transformation really occur dynamically ? \" in order to answer to this question , we first consider the transformation from a black hole state to a wormhole state . </S>",
    "<S> of course , there is some obstacle in gr context since the black hole should pass the extremal black hole to become a wormhole state but the extremal black hole has vanishing hawking radiation and temperature so that it is believed as the stable ground state in the black hole states . </S>",
    "<S> however recently , certain classical instability , known as _ aretakis instability _ , for extremal black holes have been found in gr so that the usual belief may not be quite correct aret . a heuristic argument </S>",
    "<S> about this instability suggests that the inner horizon instability of near - extremal black holes pois might cause an instability of the coincided inner and outer horizons maro . if this is the case , we may expect a similar instability in our extremal black holes also , due to the ( expected ) inner horizon instability . </S>",
    "<S> park:2006 , which seems to be a quite generic property of the inner horizons , including those of the black holes in hoava gravity park . </S>",
    "<S> ]    now then , let us consider the transformation from a wormhole state to a black hole state . in this case , there does not seem to exist any classical obstacle against this transformation , which resembles the collapse of stars made of ordinary matter to make a black hole , where the entropy would increase in the process . actually , in the conventional wormhole context with exotic matters in gr , the collapse of the morris - thorne wormhole into a black hole was observed from non - linear instability under ordinary matter perturbations shin . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the similar non - linear instability , though linearly stable , exits for our wormhole state too so that it transforms to the extremal black hole state , a seed of large black holes .    finally , two further remarks are in order .    </S>",
    "<S> first , even though we have obtained the solution in a particular quantum gravity model which is power - counting renormalizable without ghost problems , the features of the small scale structure seems to be quite generic if _ the vanishing hawking temperature for a planck mass black hole _ , which implying the existence of the wormhole throat @xmath35 satisfying @xmath62 , is considered as a verifiable prediction that any theory of quantum gravity makes . for example , so called ,  renormalization group improved black hole spacetimes \" would have the similar wormhole structure and our discussion may not be limited to hoava gravity bona . </S>",
    "<S> but we can easily check that it is not applicable to kerr nor reissner - nordstrm black holes in gr : in these cases , there are more metric functions or additional matter fields but there is no solution for the throat where all the metric functions or fields join smoothly .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we have found that , in order to describe the negative mass solution ( 14 ) , we need to consider the coupling constant of @xmath61 so that one can recover the well - defined gr parameters @xmath63 in the ir limit . </S>",
    "<S> this does not affect the couplings of the second - derivative terms in the action ( 2 ) ( note that we are considering the case of @xmath64 ) but only affects other uv couplings lu , which differ from those for the positive mass solution ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the ( weak ) _ equivalence principle _ may be violated by uv effects generally , depending on the sign of particle s mass . </S>",
    "<S> it would be a challenging problem that the runaway motions of a pair of positive and negative mass particles could be avoided from the inequivalent motions of the positive and negative mass particles in uv . </S>"
