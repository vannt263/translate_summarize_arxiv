    "quantification of diffusive and translational dynamics of particles is interesting for the study of fundamental fluid dynamic processes such as , shear dependent diffusion @xcite , and for a number of applications such as e.g. , aerosols @xcite , particle sorting @xcite , intracellular transport @xcite , biofilm growth @xcite , and blood circulation @xcite . in principle two techniques are available to quantify flow and diffusion simultaneously .",
    "first , particle tracking based techniques such as particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) , use a sequence of ( microscopy ) images to track the motion of individual particles which are then used to calculate the particle displacement to find the relevant dynamic parameters .",
    "second , dynamic light scattering ( dls ) based technique detect the fluctuations of single scattered light by an ensemble of particles without resolving the individual particles . by fitting an appropriate model to the autocorrelation function of the scattered light , the ensemble averaged particle dynamics are measured .",
    "however , in the case of ptv the focus has to be mechanically scanned along the propagation direction of the light to produce useful imaging ranges and in dls the path - length distribution of the scattered light is not known , providing only volumetric averaged information about the ensemble particle dynamics .",
    "localized particle dynamics can be probed using optical coherence tomography ( oct ) . using a combination of coherent and confocal gating oct measures the exact path - length distribution of the scattered light up to a few millimeters deep into a sample and with high spatio - temporal resolution @xcite .",

    "previously , we have shown that the autocorrelation function can be used to quantify the flow velocity for arbitrary flow angles in the presence of diffusion @xcite . in the case of shear flow",
    "the velocity gradient over the coherent detection gate is a source of additional decorrelation of the oct signal . with the aim of studying the coupling of the flow and diffusion process in the measurement model ,",
    "we constrain the measurement to be perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "although usually , both processes are assumed to be independent sources of decorrelation , we show that the flow velocity and the diffusion coefficient can only be reliably estimated in a regime determined by the sample diffusivity , the local flow velocity , and the gaussian beam waist .",

    "interestingly , interpreting the gaussian ( flow ) term as being a transit time effect of the moving scatterers through the illumination profile would result in a dependence on the local beam radius .",

    "the decay due to flow does not depend on the local gaussian beam radius .",
    "our experimental results show that the uncertainty with which either the diffusion coefficient and the flow velocity can be quantified is determined by a competition between the single exponential ( diffusion ) and gaussian ( flow ) decay terms in the autocorrelation function . in the particular case of relatively low flow velocities the decay of the autocorrelation function",
    "is dominated by the diffusive dynamics and is well described by a single exponential decay . in this case , the contribution of the gaussian ( flow ) term to the total decay is small and therefore the estimation of the flow velocity suffers of a large uncertainty . in the case of relatively high flow velocities the decay of the autocorrelation function is dominated by the translational dynamics and is well described by a gaussian decay .",
    "this results in a large uncertainty of the diffusion coefficient since the contribution of the single exponential decay to the total decay is relatively small .",
    "the choice of the beam waist determines in which regime either dynamical process dominates the decay of the autocorrelation function .",
    "we identify two regimes for the choice of the beam waist . for applications where the focus lies in the estimation of the diffusion coefficient",
    ", it is more suitable to choose for a larger beam waist such that the decay due to diffusion dominates over a large part of the velocity range of interest .",
    "however , for applications where the focus lies in quantifying small flow velocities , a smaller beam waist is more suitable such that the decay due to flow dominates . as an illustrative example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : diss1 ] the decay time constants @xmath52 ( diffusion ) and @xmath53 ( flow ) and the corresponding uncertainties based on the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowdiff40vs100 ] .",
    "we can clearly see that as long as the decay due to diffusion dominates over the decay due to flow , the uncertainty of the diffusion coefficient remains close to @xmath54 .",
    "however , as the decay due to flow starts dominating , the uncertainty increases .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the uncertainty of the flow velocity , where an uncertainty of @xmath55 is measured when the decay due to flow determines the total decay .",
    "finally , by choosing either a large or a small beam waist we can shift the regime where either , the decay due to flow or due to diffusion , determines the total decay of the autocorrelation function .    in the experiments performed for this work , we have constrained the flow to be perpendicular to the propagation direction of the imaging beam . by doing this ,",
    "we have been able to study the influence of flow and diffusion on the amplitude terms of the normalized autocorrelation function .",
    "in essence , a generalization to arbitrary flow directions is possible .",
    "as we have shown previously , a longitudinal flow velocity component can be accurately measured by fitting an additional phase term to the normalized autocorrelation function @xcite . for moderate shear rates the phase and the amplitude terms in the autocorrelation function remain uncoupled and thus , the results presented in this work can be generalized directly to the more complex case of arbitrary flow direction .    in principle",
    ", a generalization of our results to arbitrary values of the beam waist is possible but should be performed with care . for small",
    "beam waists a strong reduction in the depth of focus would become a limitation for practical applications requiring long imaging ranges .",
    "also , as a consequence of tight focusing a stronger dependency on the scattering angle is expected which has been shown to result in a more complex functional decay for the diffusive dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a smaller beam waist will limit the maximum flow velocity that can be measured . in this case , the temporal resolution of the autocorrelation function should be sufficiently small to sample the flow decay @xmath53 sufficiently . for large beam waists the influence of low signal - to - noise ratios @xcite and multiple scattering @xcite should also be considered .",
    "a thorough description of these effects on the estimation uncertainty of the dynamical parameters is subject of future research .",
    "we presented measurements of the local diffusion coefficient and flow velocity based on the normalized autocorrelation function measured by optical coherence tomography . based on our model",
    ", we have obtained accurate results by fitting the model to the measured data with only the physically relevant parameters as fitting parameters .",
    "our results on a flowing solution of polystyrene spheres show that the flow velocity and the diffusion coefficient are reliably estimated .",
    "the regime where this is possible is determined by the diffusion coefficient of the sample , the local flow velocity , and the gaussian beam waist produced by the focusing optics .",
    "we have experimentally shown that a smaller beam waist results in an improved estimation of the flow velocity and that a larger beam waist results in an improved estimation of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "finally , we showed that the decay of the autocorrelation due to flow depends only on the gaussian beam waist irrespective of the sample position with respect to the focus position .",

    "<S> further , we show that the decay of the oct autocorrelation due to flow depends only on the gaussian beam waist irrespective of the sample position with respect to the focus position .    @xmath0biomedical engineering & physics , academic medical center , university of amsterdam , po box 22700 , 1100 de amsterdam , the netherlands    @xmath1department of imaging physics , faculty of applied sciences , delft university of technology , lorentzweg 1 , 2628 cj delft , the netherlands    ` n.m.weiss@amc.uva.nl ` </S>"
