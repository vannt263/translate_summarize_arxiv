    "the solar neutrino problem is one of the central issues in the neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the neutrino oscillation is assumed to be the solution of the problem and the focus of the solar neutrino physics is to determine oscillation parameters : the mass difference among @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and their mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical factor @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 the cross section of the @xmath14-capture reaction @xmath3be(@xmath15)@xmath0b and @xmath16 the sommerfeld parameter , plays an essential role in the investigation of neutrino oscillation , since the prediction value for the flux of the @xmath0b neutrino , which is intensively being detected on the earth , is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the required accuracy from astrophysics is about 5% in errors .    because of difficulties of direct measurements for the @xmath14-capture reaction at very low energies , alternative indirect measurements were proposed : @xmath14-transfer reactions and @xmath0b coulomb dissociation are typical examples of them . in the former the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) method",
    "@xcite is used , carefully evaluating its validity , while in the latter the virtual photon theory ( vpt ) is adopted to extract @xmath1 ; the use of vpt requires the condition that the @xmath0b is dissociated through its pure e1 transition , the validity of which is not yet clarified quantitatively .    in the present paper",
    "we propose systematic analysis of @xmath0b coulomb dissociation by means of the anc method , instead of vpt .",
    "an important advantage of the analysis is that one can evaluate the error of @xmath1 coming from the use of the anc method ; the fluctuation of @xmath1 , by changing the @xmath0b single - particle wave functions , can be interpreted as the error of the anc analysis  @xcite . for the calculation of @xmath0b dissociation cross sections , we use the method of continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc )  @xcite , which was proposed and developed by kyushu group .",
    "cdcc is one of the most accurate methods being applicable to breakup processes of weakly - bound stable and unstable nuclei . as a subject of the present analysis ,",
    "four experiments of @xmath0b coulomb dissociation done at riken  @xcite , gsi  @xcite , msu  @xcite and notre dame  @xcite are available . among them",
    "we here take up the notre dame experiment at 25.8 mev and extract @xmath1 by the cdcc + anc analysis , quantitatively evaluating the validity of the use of the anc method .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that cdcc can successfully be applied to the msu data at 44 mev / nucleon .",
    "however , the cdcc calculation requires extremely large modelspace ; typically the number of partial waves is 15,000 .",
    "thus , preceding systematic cdcc + anc analysis of the experimental data at intermediate energies , we propose hybrid ( hy ) coupled - channels ( cc ) calculation by means of the standard cdcc and the eikonal - cdcc method ( e - cdcc ) , which allows one to make efficient and accurate analysis .",
    "e - cdcc describes the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion between the projectile and the target nucleus by a straight - line , which is only the essential difference from cdcc . as a consequence ,",
    "the resultant e - cdcc equations have a first - order differential form with no huge angular momenta , hence , one can easily and safely solve them .",
    "because of the simple straight - line approximation , results of e - cdcc may deviate from those by cdcc .",
    "one can avoid this problem , however , by constructing hy scattering amplitude from results of both cdcc and e - cdcc .",
    "this can be done rather straightforwardly , since the resultant scattering amplitude by e - cdcc has a very similar form to the quantum - mechanical one , which is one of the most important features of e - cdcc . in the latter part of the present paper",
    "we show how to perform the hy calculation and apply it to @xmath2ni(@xmath0b,@xmath3be@xmath4)@xmath2ni at 240 mev .    in sec .",

    "second , calculation of @xmath0b breakup cross section by means of cdcc is briefly described in subsection  [ anc+cdccb ] .",

    "the anc method is a powerful tool to extract @xmath1 indirectly .",
    "the essence of the anc method is that the cross section of the @xmath3be(@xmath15)@xmath0b at stellar energies can be determined accurately if the tail of the @xmath0b wave function , described by the whittaker function times the anc , is well determined .",
    "the anc can be obtained from alternative reactions where peripheral properties hold well , i.e. , only the tail of the @xmath0b wave function has a contribution to observables .",

    "we apply the anc method to @xmath0b coulomb dissociation , where @xmath1 has been extracted by using vpt based on the principle of detailed balance . in order to use vpt ,",
    "the previous analyses neglected effects of nuclear interaction on the @xmath0b dissociation , which is not yet well justified .",
    "additionally , roles of the e2 component , interference with the dominant e1 part in particular , need more detailed investigation , although recently some attempts to eliminate the e2 contribution from measured spectra have been made . on the contrary ,",
    "the anc analysis proposed here is free from these problems .",
    "we here stress that as an important advantage of the present analysis , one can evaluate quantitatively the error of @xmath1 by the fluctuation of the anc with different @xmath0b single - particle potentials .    comparing with ref .",
    "@xcite , in the present anc analysis angular distribution and parallel - momentum distribution of the @xmath3be fragment , instead of the total breakup cross sections , are investigated , which is expected to give more accurate value of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , our purpose is to make systematic analysis of @xmath0b dissociation at not only intermediate energies but also quite low energies .",
    "thus , the breakup process should be described by a sophisticated reaction theory , beyond the extended glauber model used in ref .",
    "@xcite . for that purpose",
    ", we use cdcc , which is one of the most accurate methods to be applicable to @xmath0b dissociation .",
    "generally cdcc describes the projectile ( c ) + target ( a ) system by a three - body model as shown in fig .  1 ;        in the present case c is @xmath0b and 1 and 2 denote @xmath3be and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the relative momentum @xmath31 between c and a is related to the internal one @xmath32 of c through the total - energy conservation .    in cdcc",
    "the summation over @xmath29 and integration over @xmath32 are truncated at certain values @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . for the latter ,",
    "furthermore , we divide the @xmath32 continuum into @xmath35 _ bin_-states , each of which is expressed by a discrete state @xmath36 with @xmath37 denote a certain region of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath38 .",

    "the resultant @xmath59 is 0.96 and 1.20 with the @xmath0b wave functions by kim and esbensen - bertsch , respectively , showing quite strong dependence on @xmath0b models .",
    "in contrast to that , the anc @xmath61 calculated by @xmath62 with @xmath63 the single - particle anc , is found to be almost independent of the choice of @xmath0b wave functions , i.e. , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the anc method works in the present case within 1% of error .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained the following result : @xmath66 where the uncertainties from the choice of the modelspace of cdcc calculation ( 1.5% ) and the systematic error of the experimental data ( 10% ) are also included .",
    "although the quite large experimental error prevents one from determining @xmath1 with the required accuracy ( 5% ) , the cdcc + anc method turned out to be a powerful technique to determine @xmath1 with small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "more careful analysis in terms of the charge distribution of @xmath3be , nuclear optical potentials and roles of the intrinsic spins of the constituents , are being made and more reliable @xmath1 will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in sec .  [ anc+cdcc ] we showed that the cdcc + anc analysis for the @xmath0b dissociation at 25.8 mev gives @xmath1 with good accuracy , being free from rather ambiguous assumptions made in the previous analyses using vpt . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the anc method works well for one - nucleon breakup reactions at intermediate energies .",

    "thus , it is expected that accurate determination of @xmath1 can be done by the cdcc + anc analysis of @xmath0b coulomb dissociation measured at riken  @xcite , gsi  @xcite and msu  @xcite .    from a practical point of view",
    ", however , cdcc calculation including long - ranged coulomb coupling - potentials requires extremely large modelspace rather difficult to handle ; typically the number of partial waves is 15,000 for the msu data  @xcite .",
    "although interpolation technique for angular momentum reduces the number of cc equations to be solved in terms of @xmath26 , those with huge angular momenta are rather unstable and careful treatment is necessary . in this sense , it seems almost impossible to apply cdcc to the gsi data at 250 mev / nucleon , where @xmath57 is expected to exceed 100,000 .    on the contrary ,",
    "semi - classical approaches , expected to work quite well at intermediate energies , are free from any problems concerned with huge angular momenta .",
    "the accuracy of such semi - classical calculations , however , is difficult to be evaluated quantitatively , although one may naively estimate the error is only less than about 10% or so .",

    "in the present paper we propose systematic analysis of @xmath0b coulomb dissociation with the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) method . an important advantage of the use of the anc method is that one can extract the astrophysical factor @xmath1 evaluating its uncertainties quantitatively , in contrast to the previous analyses with the virtual photon theory ( vpt ) .    in order to make accurate analysis of the measured spectra in dissociation experiments , we use the method of continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) , which was developed by kyushu group .",
    "the cdcc + anc analysis was found to work very well for @xmath2ni(@xmath0b,@xmath3be@xmath4)@xmath2ni at 25.8 mev measured at notre dame , and we obtained @xmath110 ( evb ) , which is consistent with both the latest recommended value @xmath111 evb  @xcite and recent results of direct measurements  @xcite .",
    "the cdcc + anc analysis is expected to work well also at intermediate energies . from a practical point of view",
    ", however , cdcc calculation for @xmath0b coulomb dissociation at several tens of mev / nucleon requires extremely large modelspace , typically about 15,000 partial waves are needed . in order to make efficient analysis at intermediate energies , we introduce a new version of cdcc , that is , the eikonal - cdcc method ( e - cdcc ) .",
    "e - cdcc describes the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion between the projectile and the target nucleus by a straight - line and treats the excitation of the projectile explicitly , by constructing discretized - continuum - states same as in cdcc .",
    "the resultant e - cdcc equations are easily and safely be solved , since they have a first - order differential form and no huge angular momenta , in contrast to the cdcc equations .",
    "inclusion of the coulomb distortion can be done with the use of coulomb wave functions instead of plane waves in eikonal ( ek ) approximation .",
    "one of the most important features of e - cdcc is that the resultant scattering amplitude @xmath82 has a very similar form to the quantum - mechanical ( qm ) one , i.e. , @xmath82 is expressed by the sum of partial amplitudes @xmath94 , using relation between the angular momentum @xmath30 and the impact parameter @xmath63 .",
    "this allows one to construct the hybrid ( hy ) amplitude @xmath92 rather straightforwardly ; @xmath92 is given by the sum of the partial amplitudes calculated by cdcc for smaller @xmath30 , @xmath112 , and those by e - cdcc for larger @xmath30 , @xmath113 , where @xmath96 is the connecting value .",
    "the hy calculation make the cdcc + anc analysis much simple , retaining its accuracy ; all qm effects necessary can be included through @xmath93 .",
    "the validity of the hy calculation is tested for @xmath2ni(@xmath0b,@xmath3be@xmath4)@xmath2ni at 240 mev .",
    "the hy calculation turned out to perfectly  reproduce the elastic and total breakup cross sections obtained by the qm one , namely , the error is only less than 1% ; the appropriate value of @xmath96 is found to be 400 ( 200 ) for the total - breakup ( elastic ) cross section , which is much smaller than the required maximum value of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "calculation with a hy cross section , not hy amplitude , was found to fail to reproduce the corresponding qm result , which shows the importance of the interference between the lower ( qm ) and higher ( ek ) regions of @xmath30 .    in conclusion ,",
    "systematic analysis of @xmath0b coulomb dissociation with the anc method and the hy coupled - channels ( cc ) calculation is expected to accurately determine @xmath1 , with reliable evaluation of its uncertainties .",
    "an extracted @xmath1 from the riken , msu and gsi data , combined with that from the notre dame experiment , will be reported in near future .",
    "the authors wish to thank m. kawai , t. motobayashi and t. kajino for fruitful discussions and encouragement .",
