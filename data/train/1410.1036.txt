    "hyperbolic geometry is a consistent geometry where the euclidean playfair s parallel postulate is discarded and replaced by the existence of many lines @xmath3 not intersecting another given line @xmath4 and passing through a given point @xmath5 ( the @xmath3 s are said _ ultra - parallel _ to @xmath4 ) .",
    "hyperbolic geometry can be studied using various models  @xcite : poincar disk or upper plane conformal models , klein non - conformal model disk model , hyperboloid conformal model , etc . from the viewpoint of computational geometry , we prefer to use klein model where lines / bisectors are euclidean straight  @xcite and then convert the output to the desired model for visualization or navigation purposes  @xcite .",

    "the distance between two points @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the open unit ball domain @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 for @xmath21 is a monotonically increasing function . since the voronoi diagram does not change by composing the distance with a monotonous function , we consider the equivalent klein distance @xmath22 . to each point @xmath23",

    "since the denominator @xmath25 is common to all functions , the minimization diagram is equivalent to the minimization diagram of @xmath26 .",
    "the graph @xmath27 are _ hyperplanes _ in @xmath28 defined on @xmath29 , and the lower envelope can thus be computed from the intersection of @xmath7 halfspaces @xmath30 , yielding the voronoi unbounded polytope in @xmath2 .",
    "the hvd of @xmath7 points can be computed in the klein model as the intersection of @xmath7 half - spaces in @xmath2 and by projecting vertically ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) the polytope on @xmath1 , and clipping it with the unit ball domain : @xmath33 .",
