    "the coupling of multi - object , near - infrared spectrographs to ground - based 8-m class telescopes and the _ hubble space telescope _ has revolutionized our ability to probe the conditions of star formation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the reason for this is simple : at @xmath6 , all the key diagnostic emission lines for density , temperature , and ionization state are shifted into the near - ir , where atmospheric opacity and oh emission severely restrict our ability to measure faint lines .",
    "consequently , virtually all the information we have about the physics of high-@xmath11 star formation is based upon measurements of the bright lines of hydrogen ( h@xmath12 and h@xmath1 ) , oxygen ( [ o  ii ] @xmath2 and [ o  iii ] @xmath3 ) , nitrogen ( [ n  ii ] @xmath13 ) , and sulfur ( [ s  ii ] @xmath14 ) . galaxies at @xmath6 have lower oxygen abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , higher ionization parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and harder ionization fields @xcite than @xmath10 galaxies with similar stellar mass . moreover , by using a sample of 14 star - forming galaxies , @xcite showed that , for a fixed stellar mass and specific star formation rate , the warm ionized gas in @xmath15 star - forming regions is denser than at @xmath16 by a full order of magnitude .",
    "there is , however , one additional bright line that is rarely exploited .",
    "[ ne  iii ] @xmath0 is the isoelectronic equivalent of [ o  iii ] @xmath3 , with a strength that is often comparable to h@xmath1 .",
    "as both neon and oxygen are @xmath12-process elements that are produced together in the same regions of type  ii supernovae , their abundance ratio should be fixed across population metallicity @xcite , and indeed , that appears to be the case locally @xcite .",
    "however , ne@xmath17 has a slightly higher ionization potential than o@xmath17 ( 41.0 versus 35.1  ev ) , and its principal emission line at 3869",
    "  has a slightly higher excitation energy ( 3.2 versus 2.5  ev ) and a much higher critical density for de - excitation ( @xmath18 versus @xmath19  @xmath20 ) than its oxygen counterpart .",
    "the line therefore has significant diagnostic value , and can be used to constrain the conditions of high - redshift star formation @xcite .",
    "there have been few measurements of [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 in the high - redshift universe .",
    "perhaps the most detailed is that by @xcite , who used co - added spectra to show that for @xmath21 and @xmath22 galaxies , [ ne  iii ] traces [ o  iii ] with a strength that is similar but perhaps elevated ( @xmath23 offset ) over that seen in the local universe .",
    "the sample size of this program was small ( 23 galaxies ) , however , and the diagnostic value of neon was not investigated .",
    "here we use near - ir spectroscopy from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and a wealth of ancillary photometric data to examine the emission line ratios of [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 , [ ne  iii]/[o  ii ] , and [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] in 236 star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath5 . in  2 , we discuss the data acquired over a @xmath24 arcmin@xmath25 region of the goods - n , goods - s , and cosmos fields , and the processing techniques needed to measure individual emission line ratios . in  3 , we describe the procedures used to identify a complete , [ o  iii]-selected sample of @xmath6 galaxies , place our sample in the context of other @xmath6 surveys , and identify local systems with similar stellar masses and star formation rates . in  4 , we present our measurements of [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 with respect to [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , [ o  iii ] @xmath3 , and h@xmath1",
    ". since only @xmath26 of our sample have all four lines detected with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than one , we also present measurements of a set of stacked spectra . in this section",
    ", we compare our data to neon and oxygen measurements at @xmath10 , and demonstrate that the average [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] ratio measured at @xmath6 is significantly greater than that seen locally . in  5 , we discuss the possible sources of the high [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] ratio , including clumpy hii regions , hotter exciting stars , oxygen depletion out of the gas - phase , higher neon to oxygen abundances , and the existence of compton - thick active galactic nuclei .",
    "we conclude by considering observations which would test these hypotheses .    for this work we adopt a standard @xmath27cdm cosmology , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30  km  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath31 , and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) . unless stated otherwise , the equivalent widths ( ew ) discussed in this paper are quoted in the rest - frame .",
    "our study of emission line ratios in the @xmath6 universe is focused on three @xmath32  arcmin@xmath25 patches of sky in the cosmos @xcite , goods - n , and goods - s @xcite fields .",
    "these regions have a wealth of photometric and spectroscopic data available for analysis , including broadband photometry from _ hst _ and _ spitzer , _ broad- and intermediate - band photometry from the ground , and optical and near - ir slitless spectroscopy from _ hst .",

    "b. weiner ) near - ir grism surveys with the wfc3 camera of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite . the primary observations of these programs consisted of g141 slitless grism spectroscopy covering the wavelength range @xmath33 m at @xmath34 resolution with a @xmath35 spatial pixel scale .",
    "approximately 625  arcmin@xmath25 was observed in the course of these surveys , including @xmath36 of the candels footprint @xcite ; when combined with accompanying direct images through the f140w filter of wfc3 , these data provide full coverage of the rest - frame wavelengths 3700 - 5020     for all @xmath5 galaxies with unobscured emission line fluxes brighter than @xmath37  ergs @xmath38 s@xmath31 .",
    "this wavelength range includes the strong emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , [ o  iii ] @xmath39 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath40 , and hydrogen ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 ) .",
    "an in - depth discussion of the reduction of these data can be found in @xcite , but in brief , each grism observation was accompanied by a shallow ( @xmath43  s ) f140w exposure , which served to define the position of each object s wavelength zeropoint and spectral trace .",
    "these images were combined using the standard procedures of multidrizzle @xcite , co - added with the deeper candels f125w and f160w frames , and processed by sextractor @xcite to produce a master catalog of all objects brighter than @xmath44 and having more than five pixels above a @xmath45 per pixel detection threshold .",

    "the result is a homogenous , psf - matched set of broad- and intermediate - band flux densities covering the wavelength range @xmath47 m to @xmath48 m over the entire region surveyed by the _ hst _ grism . in the cosmos field",

    "subaru , and a host of smaller ground - based telescopes . in goods -",
    "n , the data come from _ hst , spitzer , _ keck , subaru , and the mayall telescope , and include 22 different bandpasses , while in goods - s , six different telescopes provide flux densities in 40 bandpasses . for @xmath6 systems ,",
    "these data cover the rest - frame uv through the rest - frame near - ir and allow excellent estimates of stellar mass , under the necessary assumptions about the underlying stellar population ( i.e. , stellar metallicity , star formation history , and attenuation law ) .",
    "our galaxy sample is nearly identical to that defined by @xcite , who visually inspected over 50,000 spectra in their program to identify @xmath6 star forming galaxies .",
    "these galaxies satisfied three basic criteria :    @xmath49 a secure redshift between @xmath5 . in this redshift interval ,",
    "the emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 , h@xmath41 , h@xmath1 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath50 all fall into the range of the g141 grism .",
    "to be part of the sample , a galaxy had to have at least two of these lines reliably detected . at the @xmath34 resolution of the g141 grism , the [ o  iii ] doublet is blended , though with a distinctive , easily - identifiable shape ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 309 unique galaxies were identified through this condition .",
    "@xmath49 minimal contamination from field sources .",
    "overlapping spectra are a significant issue in slitless spectroscopy , as the dispersed order of one source frequently overlaps the spectrum of another .",
    "to estimate the importance of this effect , @xcite used the sizes and magnitudes of every object in the _ hst _ grism sextractor catalog to produce a 2-d gaussian model of every expected spectrum @xcite .",
    "this procedure identified most of the spectral superpositions , but not all : in particular , the algorithm occasionally missed some regions where the systematics of contamination subtraction dominate the error in the continuum .",
    "consequently , an additional visual inspection was needed to identify those objects where this systematic error was greater than the statistical error of the target spectrum .",
    "this criterion eliminated 57 objects from the sample .",
    "@xmath49 a well - fit spectral energy distribution .",
    "as described in  3.1 , we obtained masses for our @xmath6 galaxies by fitting their spectral energy distribution to population synthesis models via a markov - chain monte carlo code . for 16 objects ,",
    "this procedure did not converge , due either to a misidentification of the asymmetric [ o  iii ] doublet , or poor broadband photometry .",
    "these objects were excluded from our analysis , leaving us with a final sample of 236 galaxies distributed over the goods - n , goods - s , and cosmos fields .    to understand the systematics of this sample , @xcite , simulated a set of model emission - line spectra in the exact same manner as our program data .",
    "these artificial sources were randomly drawn from uniform distributions in redshift ( @xmath5 ) , log metallicity ( @xmath51 ) , and log h@xmath1 flux ( @xmath52  ergs s@xmath31  @xmath38 ) , placed on mock grism frames , and `` observed '' in the exact same manner as the original data .",
    "the results of this experiment can be found in figure  2 of @xcite . in brief , for the goods - n and goods - s fields , our 50% and 80% completeness limits for h@xmath1 flux measurements are @xmath37  ergs  s@xmath31  @xmath38 and @xmath53  ergs s@xmath31  @xmath38 , respectively , with little variation with redshift or metallicity . due to its higher background ,",
    "the cosmos limits are shallower by a factor of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "emission line fluxes were determined by fitting the continuum of each @xmath6 spectrum with a fourth - order polynomial , while simultaneously fitting gaussians of a common width to the emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 , h@xmath41 , h@xmath1 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath55 .",
    "our choice of polynomial was driven by the possible presence of a 4000    break in the stellar continuum , though fits using a series of first - order polynomials around each emission line yielded similar results .",
    "also , we did not correct any of our fits for underlying balmer absorption @xcite . in the local universe , typical corrections for h@xmath1",
    "are of the order of @xmath56     equivalent width ( ew ) , but this number is a function of both population age and imf @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 of @xcite , this factor is relatively small compared to the equivalent widths considered here .",
    "indeed , to verify that the effect is minor , we repeated all our analyses while adding 4    ew to each of our h@xmath1 measurements .",
    "this action has the effect of increasing all our h@xmath1 fluxes by an average of @xmath57 , hence lowering our [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratios by the same amount .      to place our neon measurements in context",
    ", we must first define the global properties of our galaxy sample , particularly their star formation rates ( sfrs ) and stellar masses .",
    "the former parameter can be computed in two ways : through the h@xmath1 line luminosity , which measures the ionizing flux from @xmath58 stars born in the past @xmath18  yr , and the rest - frame uv continuum , which records stellar emission from @xmath59 stars younger than @xmath60  yr @xcite . @xcite investigated the behavior of these two indicators in the same sample of galaxies considered here , and found that uv - based sfrs are less sensitive to shifts in galactic metallicity than balmer emission .",
    "we therefore adopted the @xcite uv - based sfrs for our analysis .",
    "these values are derived from the photometry of @xcite , and are based on the fits to the 1600    flux density , assuming a power - law slope to the uv continuum , the @xcite obscuration law , and the local sfr calibration @xcite .",
    "our stellar masses are based upon the analysis of @xcite , who used the markov chain monte carlo code galmc @xcite to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of every galaxy in our sample . in brief , the @xcite photometric measurements were fit to the 2007 version of population synthesis models of @xcite , using a @xcite imf over the range @xmath61 , a @xcite obscuration law , and the prescription for emission lines given by @xcite , as updated by @xcite . since stellar abundances are poorly constrained by broadband sed measurements , the metallicity of these models was fixed at @xmath62 , which is close to the median gas - phase metallicity of our sample @xcite . to avoid the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ,",
    "all data points redward of rest - frame @xmath63 m were excluded from the fits @xcite , as were measurements blueward of 1216   , where the statistical correction for intervening ly@xmath12 absorption @xcite may not always be appropriate .",
    "finally , for simplicity , the sfr of each galaxy was assumed to be constant with time .",
    "although almost certainly not the case , this constraint does not strongly affect our estimates for the stellar mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrmass ] compares the masses and sfrs of our galaxies to other members of the @xmath6 `` galaxy zoo '' . for the figure ,",
    "literature sfrs and stellar masses were converted from a @xcite imf to a @xcite imf by subtracting 0.16 and 0.25 dex , respectively .",
    "no correction was made from a @xcite imf to a @xcite imf as this correction is small ( @xmath646% ) .",
    "we highlight other @xmath6 galaxy samples using ellipses defined to include @xmath65% of their galaxies . in general ,",
    "the galaxies selected by the _ hst _",
    "grism are less massive and have lower star formation rates than systems selected via their broadband continuum measurements . in this respect ,",
    "our emission - line galaxies are similar to ly@xmath12 emitting systems ( laes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "another way to view the global properties of our sample of @xmath6 grism galaxies is through a comparison with local star - forming systems .",
    "such an analysis is not straightforward since , on average , @xmath6 systems form stars ten times more rapidly than do local objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we can create an analogous sample by applying luminosity , equivalent width , and stellar mass cuts to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data release 7 @xcite mpa - jhu galaxy catalog .",
    "specifically , we selected objects with extinction - corrected h@xmath1 luminosities @xmath67  ergs s@xmath31 , stellar masses between @xmath68 , and h@xmath1 equivalent widths greater than 5    ( so that the measurement of flux is not dominated by the correction for stellar absorption ) . for inclusion in our comparison sample , we also required that the galaxies emission line fluxes at [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 , h@xmath1 , [ o  iii ] @xmath3 , and [ o  iii ] @xmath69 all be at least twice as large as their flux error .",
    "this latter criterion facilitated direct measurements of the systems electron temperatures , enabling a better understanding of their physical conditions @xcite , while only reducing the sample by @xmath70% .",
    "our selection criteria resulted in the identification 2890 galaxies between @xmath71 with a median redshift of @xmath72 .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ssfrmass ] , our @xmath6 grism galaxies have mass - specific star formation rates that are much higher than most of the comparison objects .",
    "consequently , to obtain an even better set of analogs , we further restricted the local sample to `` young '' galaxies , i.e. , systems with high h@xmath1 equivalent widths ( ew@xmath73   ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig : ssfrmass ] demonstrates , this additional criterion creates a local sample that is quite similar to our @xmath6 dataset , i.e. , the distant star - forming galaxies identified by the _ hst _ grism are comparable in both mass and specific star formation rate to the `` green pea '' galaxies @xcite and the luminous blue compact galaxies identified by @xcite in their analysis of the sdss spectral catalog . by including lower equivalent width objects in our initial sample , however ,",
    "we did diversify the population : as the commonly used @xcite diagnostic indicates , the larger comparison set contains both star forming regions and agn , with some objects being composites of the two populations .",

    "it is clear that , although the measurement uncertainties are large , our @xmath6 star - forming galaxies have neon / oxygen line ratios that are significantly higher than that seen in the local universe . in the [ ne  iii]/[o  ii ] diagram ,",
    "the _ hst _ grism galaxies typically lie @xmath7  dex above the sequence defined by local starbursting galaxies , while for [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] , the median offset is @xmath81  dex .",

    ", we followed the procedures discussed in @xcite .",
    "we began by subtracting the continuum from each spectrum using a single fourth - order polynomial in the 1-d case and multiple fourth - order polynomials covering the spatial direction for the 2-d data .",
    "we then shifted each spectrum into the rest frame via linear interpolation with 1/3 pixel ( 5    sampling ) in the wavelength direction , and 1/3 pixel ( @xmath86 ) sampling in the spatial direction .",
    "slightly different sampling sizes ( i.e. , 1/2 or 3/4 of a pixel ) did not substantially effect the result .",
    "next , we scaled each spectrum to its flux in the [ o iii ] @xmath875007 line , and computed the median value for each wavelength , and ( for the 2-d spectral extractions ) for each spatial position . by median",
    "stacking , we preserved the relative strengths of the emission lines , enabling us to measure line ratios .",
    "we then computed errors for the median stack using the 16th and 84th percentiles of 500 bootstrap with replacement iterations of this process .",
    "finally , to check for consistency , we summed the central @xmath88 ( @xmath83 re - sampled pixels , or @xmath89  kpc ) of the 2-d median spectrum and compared it to the corresponding median produced from the 1-d analysis .",
    "as figure 4 illustrates , there is excellent agreement between the two results .",
    "the collapsed 2-d median spectrum does have a slightly higher signal - to - noise ratio than the 1-d median , and we use that in the analysis below .",
    "however , the results do not change if we use the 1-d median stacks .    to investigate the behavior of [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 with galaxy type , we divided our sample of @xmath6 galaxies into subgroups and stacked their spectra by stellar mass , sfr , and mass - specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) . as expected , the results of these analyses are correlated , since , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sfrmass ] , star formation rate and stellar mass are related . moreover , as figure  [ fig : ssfrmass ] illustrates , our selection criteria produce an artificial correlation between ssfr and stellar mass at the low mass end of our distribution . in what follows ,",

    "the trend with stellar mass follows that defined by local low - mass starburst galaxies , but with a mean offset of @xmath90  dex , which is still marginally consistent with the high - ew@xmath91 local sample .",
    "the offset in the [ ne iii]/[o iii ] diagram is more dramatic : even if one assumes _ no _ extinction , there is still a @xmath92  dex offset between the @xmath6 and local sample for each mass bin . if a @xcite obscuration law and the uv slope is used to correct each grism spectrum prior to stacking , this offset balloons to @xmath93  dex across all masses ( 7.5 @xmath94 log(m@xmath77/m@xmath78 ) @xmath94 10.5 )",

    "the source of the discrepancy is unknown .      to understand the line ratios displayed in figures  [ fig : ratiomass ] and [ fig : ratiomasscomp ] , we begin by considering the local sample of galaxies . in the diagrams ,",
    "we plot two sets of objects : those whose line ratios suggest the presence of an agn , and those which appear to be normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the former systems are generally identified by comparing [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 to [ n  ii]/h@xmath12 ( i.e. , via the bpt diagram ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although in the absence of [ n  ii]/h@xmath12 , stellar mass can be used as a proxy @xcite .",
    "few of our objects fall on this agn sequence ; in general , the @xmath6 galaxies detected by the _ hst _",
    "grism are lower - mass objects with [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratios that place them securely in the star - formation region of the diagram .",
    "the star - forming galaxies themselves lie on a sequence traced by both the nebular electron temperature and excitation : as the mass of a system decreases , the auroral [ o  iii ] @xmath69 line becomes more prominent , and the dominant state of oxygen shifts from o@xmath106 to o@xmath17 .",
    "both of these trends are generally interpreted as being due to metallicity , as fewer metals mean hotter stars and larger ionization parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while fewer coolants translate into higher electron temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the [ ne  iii ] line ratios derived from the stacked spectra follow these trends .",
    "as the stellar mass and metallicity increase , there is a decline in the ( reddening independent ) ratio of [ ne  iii]/[o  ii ] which exactly follows that seen in the local universe .",
    "meanwhile , the ( reddening - corrected ) [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] ratio marginally increases by @xmath107  dex per dex in stellar mass , again , consistent with local observations ( @xmath108  dex per dex in stellar mass ) .",
    "the difficulty arises when considering the absolute strength of [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 .",
    "neon and oxygen are formed together in type  ii supernovae @xcite , and their doubly - ionized states have similar ionization potentials .",
    "consequently , in the local universe , [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath3 are tightly correlated across all star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 178 high - equivalent width ( ew@xmath109 100  ) starburst galaxies which most closely match our @xmath6 systems in both stellar mass and specific star formation rate are plotted in figure  [ fig : ssfrmass ] .",
    "the median de - reddened value of [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] for these objects is @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast , the value for our total median stacked @xmath6 spectrum is @xmath111 without any correction for reddening .",
    "if we then de - redden each spectrum using the slope of the stellar uv continuum and a @xcite obscuration law , the ratio of the re - stacked data becomes @xmath112 , i.e. , nearly @xmath113 greater than the local measurement .",
    "this offset is higher than that found by @xcite , who obtained a @xmath114 offset of @xmath115 using the extinction - corrected composite spectrum of 23 galaxies with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite did note , however , that their data have a rather large ( @xmath118 ) uncertainty in the relative calibration of [ o  iii ] to h@xmath12 .",
    "their measurements are therefore consistent with ours when taking the relative calibration uncertainties into account .",
    "the @xmath841.5@xmath119 enhancement in the [ ne  iii ] emission of @xmath6 star - forming galaxies over that seen in local galaxies with similar global properties , has several possible explanations :      the high [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] ratio found for our @xmath6 galaxies relies on our stacking analysis , so an error in our methodology or extinction correction could result in an elevated ratio . to investigate the former , we scrutinized the flux calibration , continuum subtraction , and biases related to our stacking methodology . for flux calibration",
    ", we relied only on the g141 grism calibration , which has been documented to be accurate to @xmath120 . nevertheless , to test the relative flux calibration over scales of @xmath842000  , we binned our data by redshift ( or , equivalently , by observed wavelength ) and found no significant variations in the ratios of emission line strengths , suggesting that the flux calibration is indeed stable . similarly , to test for errors in our continuum subtraction , we binned our data by estimated levels of spectral contamination . in our 1-d and 2-d grism spectra ,",
    "the underlying continuum is a combination of stellar emission from the galaxy and residual contamination from overlapping spectra ( see section  [ sec : sample ] ) . to capture the trends in both",
    ", we fit the continuum with a fourth order polynomial , and this could , in theory , introduce a systematic bias .",
    "however , an analysis of our spectra shows no significant relation between line strength and contamination .",
    "moreover , when we repeated our stacking procedure using the best - fit seds from our stellar mass estimations , the simplified polynomial approximation enhanced [ ne  iii ] ( by 5% ) , leaving [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] relatively unaffected .    to verify the robustness of our stacking procedure , we compared the line ratios found from the median stacks of all the objects with individual line detections with the median of the individual line ratios measured from these same data .",
    "the results were consistent . also , to examine whether our extinction corrections were affecting the stacking process , we compared the results of stacks where reddening corrections were applied prior to stacking with similar stacks where de - reddening occurred only after the fact .",
    "again , there was no difference in the results .",
    "finally , one complication related to wfc3 ir grism extractions is that the point spread function ( psf ) becomes slightly larger with wavelength . for point sources this",
    "must be taken into account , but if the galaxies are substantially larger than the psf , the issue is mitigated .",
    "as seen in the cutouts of figure 1 , most of our @xmath6 galaxies are indeed resolved .",
    "an examination of the spatial dependence of our 2-d stacked spectra confirms that the extraction algorithm is not introducing a significant systematic error into our line measurements : the spatial extent of [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] , the two emission lines with the largest wavelength separation , are consistent ( @xmath121 full - width half maximum for the total stack ) .    the significance of our [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] result also depends on how we correct our spectra for the effects of dust . due to the excellent photometric coverage in the rest - frame uv ,",
    "the uncertainties associated with our stellar reddenings are relatively small , and this term contributes only @xmath122 of the total [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] error budget",
    ". however , the possible systematic uncertainty associated with our nebular extinctions could be larger . to translate our stellar reddenings into nebular extinctions",
    ", we used the @xcite obscuration law , which states that the applicable extinction for nebular lines is greater than that for starlight by @xmath123 .",
    "this result is supported by numerous comparisons of uv- and balmer line - based sfr measurements in the @xmath124 universe @xcite , but counter - examples exist as well @xcite .",
    "thus , we can take the very conservative approach and assume that the stars and gas are equally extinguished .",
    "under this prescription , the ratio of [ ne  iii]/[o  iii ] , @xmath125 , is still discrepant with the local value at the @xmath126 level .",
    "it is therefore exceedingly unlikely that the high neon ratios seen at @xmath6 are due to our assumptions about reddening .",
    "the critical density of the 2@xmath127 @xmath128 state of o@xmath17 that produces [ o  iii ] @xmath3 is @xmath129  @xmath20 ; for the equivalent state of ne@xmath17 , this density is @xmath18  @xmath20 . hence if the density of a typical @xmath6 h  ii region is significantly greater than that observed for h  ii regions in the local universe ( i.e. , @xmath130  @xmath20 ) , collisional de - excitation of oxygen will cause [ ne  iii ] @xmath0 to appear enhanced .",
    "such densities are more extreme than what is usually seen in massive @xmath15 galaxies @xcite , but are still plausible , especially if the star - forming regions follow a size - density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , high densities have been invoked to explain the strengths of mid - infrared emisson lines in the antennae galaxies @xcite , as well as the emission from the molecular gas of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "the effect of electron density on our line ratios can be seen in figure  [ fig : ratiocloudydens ] .",
    "we display , from left to right , the three projections of our three dimensional emission - line space and overlay our cloudy models for three different densities : 10 , 10@xmath101 , 10@xmath131 @xmath20 .",
    "for this analysis , the ionizing spectrum has been fixed to a 55,000 k blackbody spectrum as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the figure demonstrates that densities of @xmath132  @xmath20 can successfully explain the line ratios of local galaxies , with perhaps a small deficit of [ o  iii ] .",
    "however , no value of abundance , ionization parameter , or density can simultaneously explain all three line ratios for the @xmath6 systems .",
    "the difficulty with invoking high densities is that the collisional de - excitation of oxygen should affect other lines as well .",
    "for example , if [ o  iii ] emission were decreased by the requisite @xmath133 , the [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratio would be lowered by that same factor .",
    "this decrease is not evident in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : ratiomass ] .",
    "similarly , because the critical density for the nebular lines of [ o  ii ] is @xmath134  @xmath20 , the [ ne  iii]/[o  ii ] ratio would be _ greatly _ enhanced in a high - density environment ( by at least a factor of @xmath135 ; see figure  [ fig : ratiocloudydens ] ) .",
    "while it may be possible to design a multi - zone model wherein [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] are produced in different regions of a galaxy , substantial tuning would be needed , and the [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 discrepancy would remain .          for more than a decade ,",
    "it has been clear that high - redshift galaxies have , on average , higher [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratios than similar galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite showed that , at any given [ n  ii]/h@xmath12 , higher than normal [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratios could be obtained by increasing the temperature of the ionizing source from the assumed value of @xmath136  k for the local sdss galaxies , to @xmath137  k. since ne@xmath17 has a higher ionization potential than o@xmath17 , this change could , in theory , increase the fraction of doubly - ionized neon relative to oxygen .",
    "however , the difference in the ionization potentials of the two species is only 5.9  ev ( 41.0  ev versus 35.1  ev ) , so once beyond 45,000  k , increasing the temperature of a blackbody source has little effect on the ratio of the ionization states .",
    "this result is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ratiocloudytemp ] .",
    "galaxies , of course , are not a single blackbody sources , but a composite of many different stars with different effective temperatures . to examine this effect",
    ", we used the starburst99 ( sb99 , version 6.0.4 ) population synthesis code @xcite to create a more realistic ionizing spectrum for cloudy input . for a constant star formation history ,",
    "the ionizing spectrum of a sb99 galaxy is insensitive to age , once the system is older than @xmath18  yr . indeed ,",
    "if all the other parameters are fixed , the ionizing spectrum is well - fit by a blackbody with an effective temperature primarily determined by the stellar metallicity . for a @xmath138 system ,",
    "this temperature is roughly 65,000  k ; for @xmath75 , it is 55,000  k , and varying the high - mass slope of the imf has little effect on this result .",
    "we did not explore binary population synthesis or the effects of stellar rotation , but it is clear that standard sb99 models can not produce a spectrum that is hard enough to match the observed line ratios .          while neon is an inert gas ,",
    "oxygen is reactive , and can be depleted out of the gas phase onto dust grains or molecules . in the local universe , @xmath139 of oxygen is thought to be locked up in grains and molecules such as water and o@xmath140 @xcite ; if this ratio is higher in the @xmath6 universe , then our [ ne iii ] @xmath873869 observations can be explained .",
    "however , one expects fewer opportunities for dust depletion at @xmath124 , not more .",
    "conventionally , oxygen is bound up by refractory compounds such as metallic oxides and amorphous silicates , which require the prior existence of @xmath12-process and iron - peak elements . in the metal - poor environment of our @xmath6 systems , this process must be inhibited . on the other hand , when oxygen consumption is measured against the abundance of metals such as mg , si , and fe",
    ", its depletion from the gas phase is six times higher than expected ( jenkins 2009 ) .",
    "this suggests the existence of an additional avenue for the removal of oxygen from the gas phase .",
    "however , since this second avenue probably involves the creation of ices on the surfaces of dust grains @xcite , it is still likely to depend on metallicity . still , the possibility of dust depletion can not be ruled out .",

    "since @xmath142ne is formed directly from @xmath144o via @xmath12-capture , the formation regions of the two species must be highly correlated .",
    "indeed , abundance measurements in milky way and magellanic cloud planetary nebulae @xcite , h  ii regions @xcite , and other galaxies @xcite yield the same cosmic ne / o abundance over a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath145 ) .    on the other hand , @xmath143ne has a different formation site : the hydrogen and helium burning shells of massive stars in their late stages of evolution . during a thermal pulse ,",
    "some of the @xmath146c and @xmath144o produced by the fusion of helium can be convected outward to the site of the temporarily dormant hydrogen burning shell .",
