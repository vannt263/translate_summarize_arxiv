    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the most general configurational temperature definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tconfig ] ) , requires knowledge of the full @xmath6-body potential , which typically is not known for experimental systems .",
    "a more experimentally accessible form emerges if the particles interact via pairwise additive potentials , @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", we can interpret gradients of the @xmath6-body potential , @xmath19 as components of the net force acting on each of the particles due to their interactions with their neighbors , where @xmath20 is the force acting on the @xmath15-th particle .",
    "the temperature then may be written as @xcite @xmath21 it makes sense that the temperature should be reflected in the instantaneous distribution of forces because objects explore more of their potential energy landscape as the temperature increases .",
    "all definitions of the temperature derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) involve approximations of @xmath22 , and so only are valid in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath23 . dropping additional terms of @xmath22 in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tconfigf ] ) can be justified for systems with short - ranged interactions and leads to another equivalent temperature definition @xcite : @xmath24 neglecting further higher - order terms yields still another form @xcite , @xmath25",
    "choosing @xmath26 with @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) yields a hierarchy of so - called hypervirial temperatures @xcite , which reduce to the clausius s virial temperature for @xmath28 . by the same token",
    ", we propose that @xmath29 with @xmath30 , yields the set of `` hyperconfigurational temperatures '' @xcite , @xmath31 of which @xmath32 is equivalent to the standard configurational temperature . here",
    ", @xmath33 is the magnitude of the @xmath34-th element in the set of @xmath2 components of the forces on the @xmath6 particles .",
    "because @xmath33 is non - negative , @xmath35 is well defined for any positive real value of @xmath36 .",
    "negative values of @xmath36 would yield diverging temperatures because at least some of the @xmath33 will be vanishingly small for any system substantially larger than the range of interactions .",
    "a simple example motivates introducing this new hierarchy of definitions . if , for example , a system is characterized by coulomb pair interactions , @xmath37 in @xmath38 dimensions , each term of the denominator , @xmath39 , of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tconfigf ] ) and ( [ eq : tconfig1 ] ) vanishes . consequently , the associated configurational temperature definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tconfigf ] ) ,  ( [ eq : tconfig1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : tconfig2 ] ) diverge unphysically . the hyperconfigurational temperatures , by contrast , are still well defined with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the hyperconfigurational temperatures should apply to any system whose pair potential is continuous and differentiable .",
    "this suggests that they will be useful for studying systems whose interactions are not known _",
    "a priori_.    additional useful results emerge for systems such as colloidal monolayers whose interactions are isotropic . in this case",
    ", the cartesian coordinates may be analyzed independently @xmath43 setting @xmath44 or @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) leads to same results .",
    "we will refer to the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcomponents ] ) , as well as analogous results for other temperature definitions , as the cartesian components of the configurational temperature , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "a remarkable consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) is that _ any _ vector field @xmath11 that depends only on the @xmath2 configurational degrees of freedom gives rise to a functionally distinct but thermodynamically equivalent definition of the temperature that depends only on configurational coordinates .",
    "here we show that this insight emerges transparently from the hypervirial theorem @xcite , and that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) itself can be derived from this starting point .",

    "( [ eq : hvt2 ] ) yields @xmath62 which is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) when @xmath63 .",
    "hirschfelder  @xcite chose @xmath64 to obtain a hierarchy of hypervirial temperatures characterized by the index @xmath36 . choosing instead @xmath65 yields the hyperconfigurational temperatures in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hypert ] ) .",
    "a similar line of reasoning provides a straightforward derivation of the most general result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) .",
    "we begin by choosing @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvt6 ] ) to obtain @xmath67 , which is equivalent to the clausius virial theorem , @xmath68 , for systems with pairwise additive interactions .",
    "next , we choose @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is an arbitrary function of the momenta , and substitute into eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvt2 ] ) .",
    "the following steps are analogous to those used in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvt6 ] ) and yield @xmath71 combining this with eq .",
    "( [ eq : hvt6 ] ) yields @xmath72 where , once again , we have exploited the statistical independence of the coordinates and momenta .",
    "because this holds for any choice of @xmath57 and @xmath70 , it holds for any sum of products of the form @xmath73 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : qed ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgeneral ] ) for any choice of @xmath11 whose components can be expressed as taylor series in the coordinates and momenta .",
    "because the positions of microscopic particles , such as atoms , are hard to measure , experimental applications of the configurational temperature have been relatively limited  @xcite .",
    "colloidal dispersions differ from many experimental systems in that their constituents motions can be tracked quite easily . unlike most macroscopic model systems",
    ", they can be thoroughly equilibrated through the particles intimate contact with the suspending fluid . furthermore",
    ", an effective potential between two particles often can be defined .",
    "for this reason , colloidal dispersions offer an almost ideal experimental test - bed for studying the configurational temperature and related ideas .",
    "these ideas , in turn , provide valuable new tools for assessing the microscopic state of this important state of matter .",
    "this section describes methods for estimating the configurational and hyperconfigurational temperatures of colloidal dispersions from digital video microscopy measurements of their microscopic dynamics .",
    "emphasis is placed on how to account for inevitable experimental errors in systems of limited size whose interactions may not be fully characterized _ a priori_. in particular , we analyze the structure and dynamics of dilute monolayers of charge - stablized colloidal spheres confined by planar surfaces , on the one hand using convergence of different temperature definitions as a thermodynamic self - consistency test for independently measured effective pair potentials , and on the other as a new approach to measuring the pair potential directly .",
    "considerable attention has been focused in recent years on colloidal interactions , particularly in light of experimental observations that challenge theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , charged colloidal spheres of diameter @xmath74 and charge number @xmath75 dispersed in an electrolyte interact with each other directly through their coulomb repulsion and also indirectly through their influence on the surrounding distribution of simple , atomic - scale ions .",
    "poisson - boltzmann mean - field theory predicts an overall screened - coulomb repulsion @xcite of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the thermal energy scale at absolute temperature @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the spheres center - to - center separation , and @xmath80 is the bjerrum length in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath81 . if the electrolyte has a _ total _",
    "concentration @xmath82 of monovalent ions , then the debye - hckel screening length , @xmath83 , sets the range of the effective electrostatic interaction in the mean - field approximation .",
    "this is an effective interaction because it results from an average over the simple ions degrees of freedom . when viewed in this light",
    ", it is not surprising that measurements might differ from predictions based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlvo ] ) .",
    "more surprising is that like - charged colloidal spheres appear to _ attract _ each other under some circumstances , in qualitative disagreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlvo ] ) .",
    "one of the goals of the present study is to apply the configurational temperature formalism to resolve some of the outstanding questions regarding these anomalous like - charge attractions .    unlike atoms , which travel ballistically within the potential energy landscape established by inter - atomic interactions",
    ", colloidal particles are immersed in a viscous fluid that randomizes their trajectories over intervals longer than @xmath84 , the momentum relaxation time .",
    "given a typical colloidal diffusion coefficient @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "consequently colloidal suspensions microscopic temperatures are not easily monitored with the usual kinetic definition of the temperature , eq .",
    "( [ eq : equipartition ] ) .",
    "the configurational temperature , by contrast , can be measured from snapshots and so provides an ideal alternative .    the fluid also acts as an intimately coupled heat bath whose heat capacity vastly exceeds the colloidal particles. consequently , the dispersion s thermodynamic temperature is all but guaranteed to be the fluid s , which is readily monitored with standard techniques .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to compare estimates of the configurational temperature based on microscopic dynamical measurements with this bulk thermodynamic temperature .",
    "our samples consist of negatively charged silica spheres @xmath87 in diameter ( duke scientific lot .",
    "24169 ) dispersed in water and confined within a slit pore of height @xmath88 formed between a glass microscope slide and a cover slip .",
    "the glass surfaces also develop large negative charge densities in contact with water @xcite , which repel the spheres and prevent them from sticking under the influence of van der waals attraction .",
    "silica spheres are roughly twice as dense as water and sediment onto the lower wall in a matter of seconds .",
    "the low - concentration samples used in this study thus form a dilute monolayer once they reach equilibrium .",
    "reservoirs of mixed - bed ion exchange resin help to maintain a total ionic strength around @xmath89 in the @xmath90 visible sample area .",
    "the hermetically sealed sample is allowed to equilibrate at ambient temperatures on the stage of a microscope .",
    "the particles motions are imaged with a ccd ( charge - coupled device ) camera and video taped at 30 frames / sec before being digitized .",
    "standard methods of digital video analysis @xcite identify the particles in each video frame and report their locations in the plane with a resolution of 30  .",
    "the resulting distribution , @xmath91 of @xmath92 particles in the field of view at time @xmath93 provides detailed information regarding the particles dynamics under the combined influences of random thermal forces and their mutual interactions .",
    "distilling this information into an easily interpreted form requires further analysis .",
    "one of the most commonly used tools for analyzing colloidal microscopy data is the radial distribution function , @xmath94 , which is computed as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the areal density of particles in a field of view containing @xmath97 particles .",
    "angle brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) denote averages over both angle and time .",

    "such oscillations arise even in systems with monotonically repulsive interactions , and could be mistaken for structure in @xmath98 . reducing the concentration to avoid many - body correlations often is not practical given the competing requirements of tracking particles accurately ( which favors high magnifications @xcite ) and amassing adequate statistics in @xmath94 ( which favors a wide field of view and thus low magnification @xcite ) .",
    "no exact closed - form relationship between @xmath94 and @xmath98 is known for systems at finite concentrations .",

    "two complementary methods for inverting @xmath94 to obtain @xmath98 have been introduced .",
    "the inverse brownian dynamics @xcite and inverse monte carlo @xcite techniques compare the experimental radial distribution function with results obtained from numerical simulations based on experimental conditions and trial potentials until a match is obtained . the liquid structure inversion technique @xcite uses the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation @xcite to correct for many - body correlations directly .",
    "this is the approach we will adopt .",

    ", the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation is found to be accurate for `` soft '' potentials while the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation is more accurate for short - ranged interactions . for two - dimensional systems , the pair potential can be evaluated in these approximations as @xcite @xmath102 where the convolution integral , @xmath103    \\left [ g({\\vert { { \\ensuremath{{{\\mathbf r}}}\\xspace}'- { \\ensuremath{{{\\mathbf r}}}\\xspace } } \\vert } ) - 1   \\right ] d^2r',\\ ] ] is solved iteratively , starting with @xmath104 .    provided the particles concentration is not too high , and that their interactions are pairwise additive and neither too long - ranged nor too short , and that @xmath94 is known with sufficient accuracy , both approximations should yield equivalent results for @xmath98 .",
    "unfortunately , consistency does not guarantee accuracy @xcite , and additional checks are necessary to ensure that pair potentials obtained with eqs .",

    "successful collapse of the hierarchy of configurational temperatures to the thermodynamic temperature suggests that all of the conditions assumed in the configurational temperatures derivations have been met and that @xmath98 accurately describes pairwise additive contributions to the free energy of a homogeneous isotropic system in equilibrium .",
    "conversely , a failure to converge suggests that one or more of these conditions has not been met .",
    "identifying departures from equilibrium is particularly important in experimental systems where subtle fluid flows or environmental drifts can lead to correlations that might be mistaken for intrinsic interactions .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that the configurational temperature tracks sudden temperature jumps @xcite far faster than the pressure or internal energy , and that its fluctuations also decay more rapidly , particularly for shorter - ranged potentials @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the configurational temperature may converge to a well - defined value even before the system achieves equilibrium .",
    "this surprising insensitivity has been ascribed @xcite to the dominant contribution to the configurational temperature of forces among nearby pairs of particles , which can relax to near - equilibrium configurations long before a disturbance can propagate through the entire system .",

    "particles near the edge of the field of view may have strongly interacting neighbors just out of sight whose contributions to their net force would be overlooked .",

    "even when the temperature is calculated with the smoothed pair potential , a few frames still have negative temperatures .",
    "this is reasonable if @xmath142 and the pair potential has an extremum at an intermediate separation , @xmath143 . in this case",
    "@xmath144 must change sign and some particles may contribute negative values to the average in a snapshot .",
    "chances improve for the average itself to be negative if @xmath6 is small .",

    "the relatively small number of particles in the field of view has other ramifications .",
    "because the various configurational temperature definitions involve different approximations of order @xmath146 , we might expect their results to differ from each other and from the actual thermodynamic temperature accordingly .",
    "imaging a substantially larger region of the sample is not feasible . on the other hand ,",
    "deliberately sub - sampling the field of view allows us to probe the dependence on sample size , for which we can extrapolate the configurational temperatures to the thermodynamic limit .    the data in fig .",

    "the interaction range in this system is @xmath148 . reducing the number of particles in this manner substantially changes the estimated temperatures , thereby confirming the importance of finite - size scaling .",

    "for example , considerable attention has been paid in the literature to the possibility that anomalous confinement - induced like - charge attractions such as the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(h=9 ) ] might be artifactual .",
    "however , if we truncate the negative region of @xmath98 to create a purely repulsive potential and recalculate the configurational temperatures , @xmath128 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 all extrapolate to 1.5 , an error of @xmath155 .",
    "the large deviation resulting from this admittedly crude test suggests that the observed attraction is indeed an integral part of the charged particles interaction .",
    "more sensitive tests for thermodynamic consistency are provided by the hyperconfigurational temperatures defined in eq .",

    "figure  [ fig : hypert9conf ] demonstrates how small variations in @xmath98 can cause the hyperconfigurational temperatures to deviate with respect to each other and also with respect to the thermodynamic temperature .",

    "this qualitative difference is due to substantial contributions from pairs of particles with @xmath122 .",
    "such pairs should not be present in a monodisperse sample of impenetrable spheres , but appear in practice because of the sample s 3% polydispersity in radius and because of projection errors due to the particles out - of - plane fluctuations .",
    "these two effects are responsible for the observed correlations at @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(h=9 ) ] , and for the unreasonably small values of @xmath98 in the unphysical range @xmath161 .",
    "the successful collapse of the configurational and hyperconfigurational temperatures under these conditions demonstrates that the _ effective _ potential accounts for the apparent particle distribution @xmath162 and may differ subtly from the _ ideal _ pair potential .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypert9conf](b ) and [ fig : hypert9conf](c ) reflect the general trend that higher order hyperconfigurational temperatures are more sensitive to details of the input potential .",

    "even quite small differences measurably affect the temperatures calculated from the associated force components if the interaction is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "for example , we found that @xmath167 for the confined sample at @xmath168 and @xmath169 for the sample at @xmath170 .",
    "even such small differences are plainly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypert9conf](c ) .",
    "apparent anisotropies of this magnitude appear consistently in our data sets regardless of the samples composition , concentration , degree of confinement , and so are unlikely to reflect statistical errors . nor are they likely to signal a real anisotropy in our samples interactions . instead , they result from the hyperconfigurational temperatures sensitivity to subtle geometric distortion in our imaging system .",
    "rescaling the measured @xmath140 and @xmath134 coordinates slightly can substantially reduce the apparent anisotropy in the entire hierarchy of hyperconfigurational temperatures , as the data in table  [ tab : anisotropy ] show . for the system used in this study ,",
    "a 0.7% correction of the @xmath171 scale ratio is enough to account for the 5.8% anisotropy of @xmath32 in the @xmath170 data .",
    "the same scaling factor also corrects the apparent anisotropy in the other samples we have studied , and thus appears to be correctly interpreted as a correction to the calibration of our imaging system .",
    "furthermore , differences in the scaling factors as small as @xmath172 perform substantially less well , as shown by the data in table  [ tab : anisotropy ] .",
    "this level of sensitivity greatly exceeds the typical 1% calibration accuracy obtained by imaging test patterns , and thus provides a new tool for assessing and correcting geometric defects in the digital video microscopy system .",
    ".correcting apparent anisotropy in the hyperconfigurational temperatures of the @xmath170 data set by rescaling coordinates . in each case , @xmath94 , @xmath98 and @xmath35 were recalculated with revised particle locations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the configurational and hyperconfigurational temperatures show great promise as thermodynamic self - consistency tests for interaction measurements in soft - matter system .",
    "they also can be used to measure interactions directly , with the hierarchy of definitions providing a set of simultaneous constraints on free parameters in a model for the pair potential .",
    "even when the theoretical form of the potential is not known _ a priori _ , a numerically determined function that simultaneously collapses the entire hierarchy to the thermodynamic temperature would provide a model - free estimate for the potential .",
    "as an example of this procedure , we use hyperconfigurational temperatures to determine the parameters @xmath173 and @xmath75 in the screened - coulomb potential , eq .  ( [ eq : dlvo ] ) , that accounts for the distribution of particles in the @xmath170 data set @xcite . requiring @xmath174 yields a screening length of @xmath175 and an effective charge on the particles of @xmath176 .",
    "these values also converge @xmath177 and @xmath178 close to unity , suggesting that the screened - coulomb potential reasonably describes the interactions in this system .",

    "simply fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlvo ] ) to the measured pair potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypert195conf](a ) yields @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "although these values differ somewhat from those obtained by collapsing the configurational temperatures , both are broadly consistent with the charge regulation theory for interacting silica surfaces  @xcite . their disagreement and the slight departure from unity of the highest - order hyperconfigurational temperatures suggests a small deviation of the true pair potential from the predicted screened - coulomb form",
    "this is reasonable because the nearby bottom wall probably affects the interaction somewhat .",
    "no convergence is possible at all for the data at @xmath108 because the pair interactions are not well described by the purely repulsive screened - coulomb form .",
    "using hyperconfigurational temperatures to provide constraints on models for the pair potential offers advantages over other interaction measurement techniques .",
    "principally , this method eliminates the intermediate steps of first measuring @xmath94 and then inverting it to obtain @xmath98 .",
    "this first step generally requires amassing large amounts of data to obtain accurate information on correlations at small separations .",
    "the second involves uncontrolled approximations and limits the range of concentrations over which interactions can be measured . by contrast , the present approach requires substantially less data and involves fewer approximations .",
    "consequently , this approach should be useful for exploring denser , more strongly interacting systems .",
    "its ability to distinguish pairwise and many - body interactions also should be helpful for such studies .    on the other hand , calculating configurational temperatures involves sums over all pairs of particles , and must be repeated for sub - samples of varying size to account for finite - size scaling",
    ". this can be computationally expensive , particularly in model - free searches . implementing fast search algorithms on restricted data sets with additional data",
    "being added only in the final stages of polishing should alleviate this problem .",
    "failure of such a search to converge may signal a failure of pairwise additivity , a departure from equilibrium , or else an inappropriate model for the pair potential .",
    "distinguishing these would probably require resorting to one of the alternate measurement methods .",
    "the recently introduced notion of configurational temperature provides a valuable new tool for assessing experimental systems thermodynamic state from static snapshots .",
    "we have introduced a hierarchy of hyperconfigurational temperatures that emerge naturally from the generalized definition of temperature , and have shown that both these and the generalized definition of the temperature can be derived from the classical hypervirial theorem .",
    "colloidal monolayers provide an ideal experimental test bed for these new concepts in statistical mechanics .",
    "we have tested the configurational and hyperconfigurational temperature to within 1% accuracy using particles distribution and pair potentials measured in ref .",
    "the effect of finite system size is clearly observed and accounted for in these measurements . since the configurational temperatures derivation requires pairwise additivity and their computation depends sensitively on the input potential , they can be used as thermodynamic self - consistency checks for measured pair potentials .",
    "the configurational temperatures calculated for our experimental data on confined colloidal silica monolayers confirm that our measured potentials are accurate and that they are consistent with the assumption of pairwise additivity .",
    "we have found that higher - order hyperconfigurational temperatures are increasingly sensitive to errors in the potential @xmath98 because of their dependence on higher moments of the force distribution .",
    "even so , we have found that we can adjust the pair potentials within the measured uncertainties to converge the entire hierarchy of hyperconfigurational temperatures to unity for all of our data sets .",
    "this provides substantial independent evidence that our directly measured potentials reliably reflect equilibrium pair potentials for our systems .    a sum rule introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] complements the information provided by the configurational and hyperconfigurational temperatures by providing additional insights into the system s degree of equilibration .",
    "very small errors in the pair potential , moreover , are dramatically emphasized by the derivatives in the sum rule s definition .",
    "we find , nevertheless , that the sum rule can be satisfied for the colloidal samples in our study by adjusting the potential within the range of their uncertainties .    applying these analytical tools to our system of sedimented colloidal silica spheres allows us to draw new conclusions regarding the nature of electrostatic interactions in this deceptively simple system .",
    "rather than being purely repulsive , as mean - field theory predicts , confined colloids interactions can be characterized by a strong and long - ranged attraction .",
    "this result echos those reported more than a decade ago in the first generation of colloidal interaction measurements @xcite .",
    "now , however , we can assert with confidence that the observed anomalous attractions constitute pairwise - additive contributions to the systems equilibrium free energies , and not from any of the myriad of possible experimental artifacts that have been proposed .",
    "this interpretation is further bolstered by measurements of the areal pressure in these monolayers , which show clear signatures of their differing interactions . resolving the anomaly of",
    "confinement - induced like - charge attractions therefore requires a fresh assessment of the nature of colloidal electrostatic interactions in simple electrolytes .",
    "hyperconfigurational temperatures also can be used as a set of constraints to determine the free parameters in a model for a system s pair interactions .",
    "we have demonstrated this by determining the two free parameters in a screened - coulomb model for charge - stabilized colloids interactions in the repulsive regime . in principle , the unbounded hierarchy of hyperconfigurational temperatures can be used in this way to determine any pairwise additive potential given the position , particularly if that potential can be modeled as a polynomial or comparably simple function .",
    "one advantage of this method is that it circumvents the uncontrolled approximations that have dogged other approaches to measuring macroionic interactions in equilibrium .",
    "this method in more general in that it can be applied at arbitrary particle densities . unlike measurement techniques based on the radial distribution function , @xmath94 , furthermore , configurational temperature measurements can be applied to inhomogeneous systems .",
    "this new method therefore should be useful in phase separated systems at equilibrium ."
