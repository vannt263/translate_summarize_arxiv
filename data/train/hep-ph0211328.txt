    "first , i briefly remind you the classic method of calculation of 3-loop massless propagator diagrams .",
    "there are 3 generic topologies of such diagrams",
    ". they can be reduces , using integration by parts , to 6 basis integrals  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is implemented in the package mincer  @xcite ( first written in schoonschip  @xcite and later rewritten in form  @xcite ) , and in the package slicer  @xcite written in reduce  @xcite .",
    "four basis integrals are trivial .",
    "one is a two - loop diagram with a non - integer power of the middle line .",
    "it can be found as a particular case of a more general expression  @xcite for the the two - loop diagram with three non - integer powers via a hypergeometric @xmath1 function of the unit argument , with indices tending to integers at @xmath2 .",
    "there is a rather straightforward algorithm for expanding such functions in @xmath0 , with coefficients expressed via multiple @xmath3-values .",
    "i have implemented it in reduce in the summer of 2000 , some results produced by this program are published in  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly presented as algorithm a in  @xcite ; this paper also contains other , more complicated , algorithms .",
    "the algorithms of  @xcite are implemented in the c++ library nestedsums  @xcite based on the computer - algebra library ginac  @xcite .",
    "this implementation is very convenient ; unfortunately , it requires one to install an outdated version of ginac .",
    "the algorithm a seems to be also implemented in form  @xcite , but i could not understand how to use it . using my reduce procedure or nestedsums  @xcite , one can quickly find as many terms of expansion of this basis integral in @xmath0 as needed , in terms of multiple @xmath3-values .",
    "they can be expressed , up to weight 9 , via a minimum set of independent @xmath3-values , using the results of  @xcite .",
    "the two - loop diagram with a non - integer power of the middle line can also be expressed  @xcite via an @xmath1 function of the argument @xmath4 . expanding this expression in @xmath0 ( say , using nestedsums  @xcite ) ,",
    "we encounter more general euler  zagier sums , which were also considered in  @xcite . reducing them to the minimal basis",
    ", we obtain , of course , the same @xmath0-expansion of our basis integral .    using this expansion and integration - by - parts relations , it is easy to recover the well - known result for the 3-loop ladder diagram , which is finite @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "the last and most difficult basis diagram is non - planar .",
    "it is also finite at @xmath5 . using gluing of its external vertices  @xcite",
    ", one can easily understand that it has the same value @xmath7 at @xmath5 .",
    "there is no easy way to find further terms of its @xmath0- expansion .",
