    "dispersion interactions between two chemical entities arise from the instantaneous correlation of the fluctuations of their electron densities  @xcite .",
    "they are the only attractive interactions in noble gases and are therefore at the origin of the existence of their pure condensed phases  @xcite .",
    "but dispersion interactions are generally weaker than the other intermolecular interactions in molecular systems and their role in systems for which stronger attractive forces are present is hard to establish .    in density",
    "functional theory ( dft ) calculations , dispersion interactions are difficult to capture .",
    "several methods have been developed , in which they are treated directly by devising new functionals  @xcite or effectively by adding an analytical term to existing functionals  @xcite . following these developments",
    ", it was shown that dispersion interactions impact structure and dynamics in a variety of systems ; for example in water at ambient  @xcite or supercritical conditions  @xcite .",
    "but the most affected quantity is usually the density , which is understimated by as much as 20  % in water when dispersion interactions are not accounted for  @xcite .",
    "similar deviations are found in crystalline systems  @xcite . in ionic materials , the effect of dispersion",
    "is expected to be smaller due to the presence of a strong attractive coulombic interaction between species with different charges .",
    "this leads to strong charge ordering effects , and the overlap - repulsion interaction sets the distance of closest approach between two ions . the polarization ( induction ) interaction also plays a well - identified role and it is at the origin of the stabilization of non - trivial crystal structures and of the cross - linking of the coordination shells of multivalent cations in ionic melts  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown by kirchner _",
    "that in `` room - temperature '' ionic liquids , the inclusion of dispersion interactions in dft calculations modifies the vibrational and dynamic properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "dft - based molecular dynamics is however limited to short simulation times and small system sizes , so that it is hard to establish clearly the role of dispersion on a wide range of properties .",
    "classical molecular dynamics is an alternative option , provided that the force field accurately separates the various contributions from coulombic , repulsion , polarization and dispersion interactions . in recent years , we have developed a series of methods which make possible the derivation of such force fields for inorganic ionic materials  @xcite . in short ,",
    "we use a polarizable ion model , and all the parameters except the ones concerning dispersion are fitted to standard _ condensed phase _ dft calculations .",
    "the emphasis on  condensed phase \" here is because the physical properties of ions are strongly affected by their coordination environment and the use of _ ab initio _ data on isolated ions or on the interaction energies of small clusters leads to hopelessly inadequate force - fields .",
    "this applies particularly to the dispersion coefficients ( and polarizabilities ) . for our procedure",
    "the reference data includes both the dipole moments on each ion and the total force which is exerted on them , allowing the polarization and the repulsion terms to be fitted independently ( formal charges are used for the ions , which automatically sets the coulombic interaction ) . in addition , some parameters such as the condensed phase polarizability of the ions can directly be calculated  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion coefficients have to be treated separately , because on one hand the dispersion effects are not yet reliably represented in the dft calculations and on the other they contribute relatively weakly to the forces on the ions , which means that they do not strongly affect the quality of the fit to the dft data with the classical force - field .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform simulations of lif in the crystal and liquid phases .",
    "we compare the thermodynamic , structural and dynamic properties obtained with two different sets of condensed phase dispersion coefficients , obtained either from the _ coupled hartree - fock _ ( chf ) theory  @xcite or from a recent method  @xcite involving the use of the _ maximally localized wannier functions _ ( mlwfs )  @xcite in dft , as well as with the case where the dispersion interactions are set to zero .",
    "lif was chosen because it is a material for which we expect that the effect of the dispersion interactions is among the lowest .",
    "dispersion is negligible for the li@xmath1 cation due to its small radius .",
    "also , f@xmath2 is the halide anion with the smallest polarizability .",
    "the polarizable ion model includes coulombic , dispersion , overlap repulsion and polarization components  @xcite .",
    "first the coulombic term is : @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the charge on ion @xmath5 , and formal charges are used throughout .",
    "the dispersion component includes dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole terms @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the dipole - dipole ( dipole - quadrupole ) dispersion coefficient , and @xmath9 are damping functions @xcite , describing the short - range penetration correction to the asymptotic multipole expansion of dispersion @xcite ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "they take the form @xmath12    and the parameters @xmath13 represent the distance at which the correction begins to be taken into account .",
    "the repulsion overlap component is given by @xmath14    finally the polarization part of the potential includes charge - dipole and dipole - dipole terms : @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interaction tensors and @xmath18 is the polarizability of ion @xmath5 .",
    "again , we include some short - range effects which are due to the high compression of the ions in condensed ionic materials  @xcite .",
    "these short - range induction effects are straightforwardly included through the use of damping functions similar to the ones used in the dispersion term : @xmath19    here @xmath20 is a parameter that reflects the amplitude of this damping at ion @xmath21 due to the presence of @xmath5 and @xmath22 again is a range parameter .",
    "the instantaneous values of the dipole moments @xmath23 are obtained by minimization of @xmath24 with respect to these variables : they will therefore depend on the instantaneous positions of neighboring ions and consequently change at each timestep in an md run .",
    "the interaction potential can therefore be seen to contain three additional degrees of freedom ( induced dipoles ) , which describe the state of the electron charge density of the ions .",
    "when calculating the forces on the ions in an md simulation , these electronic degrees of freedom should have their `` born - oppenheimer '' values , which minimize the total potential energy , for every atomic configuration .",
    "we search for the ground state configurations of these degrees of freedom at each time step , using a conjugate gradient routine @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is thus similar to the so - called born - oppenheimer first - principles molecular dynamics , as implemented , for example , in the cp2k code @xcite .",
    "we perform an ewald summation of all electrostatic interactions and also of dispersion @xcite . thus , all those interactions are free from truncation errors .",
    "the short - range repulsion , which is an exponentially decaying function of distance , is however truncated beyond a distance equal to , at maximum , half the shortest dimension of the simulation cell .",

    "the comparison with experiments shows that similar differences are obtained in both cases when dispersion effects are included .",
    "the largest difference is observed when they are omitted , with an underestimation of 15.3  % for @xmath26 .",
    "such a deviation is of the same order of magnitude as that obtained in liquid water at room - temperature from dft calculations using pbe or blyp functionals  @xcite .",
    "when the dispersion effects are included , the liquid density remains underestimated , by 4.5  % and 8.5  % in the wannier and chf cases , respectively .",
    "we note that in order to reproduce more accurately the experimental density , larger values would be necessary for @xmath27 and @xmath28 parameters .",
    "such an underestimation of the density was already observed in our previous work on lif - thf@xmath29 , while a perfect agreement was obtained for lif - naf - kf and naf - zrf@xmath29 mixtures  @xcite ( both studies used the chf parameters ) .",
    "this shows that although the polarizable ion model transferability for multiple physical and chemical conditions is well established , a completely transferable model would require more complex functional form , in which `` environmental effects '' are taken into account .",
    "these environmental effects have mainly been studied for the polarizability  @xcite , and since dispersion effects follow a similar dependence on the electronic cloud extension as does the former , equivalent functional forms could be employed .",
    "radial distribution functions in liquid lif .",
    "simulations were performed at 1200  k , at the experimental density @xmath30  g @xmath31 . ]    in liquid water , the dispersion interaction was shown to impact strongly the structure and dynamics at ambient  @xcite and supercritical  @xcite conditions , even at fixed density .",
    "in particular , the first peaks of the o - o and o - h radial distribution functions and the diffusion coefficients were shown to vary substantially .",
    "this is not the case for lif : as can be seen in figure [ fig : rdf ] , no difference is observed for any of the three partial radial distribution functions .",
    "this is because in such a simple molten salt , the structure mostly arises from a competition between the coulombic interaction , which induces strong charge ordering , and the overlap - repulsion which sets the first - neighbour distance .",
    "the dispersion term is much weaker than those two and therefore does not change the structure .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are extracted from molecular dynamics simulations using einstein s relation , i.e. from the long - time slope of mean squared displacement : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of atoms of type @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the position of atom @xmath5 of type @xmath34 at time @xmath36 .",
    "we obtain similar values for the three simulation setups , i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 s@xmath40 for f@xmath2 and li@xmath1 ions , respectively .",
    "note that these values are in excellent agreement with the experimental ones  @xcite .",
    "again , this situation is very different from that observed in liquid water , in which a diffusion coefficient two to three times larger was obtained when dispersion effects were included in dft - based molecular dynamics  @xcite ( although these numbers might be mitigated due to the use of short simulation times ) . in conclusion , due to the predominance of coulombic and repulsion interactions , in contrast with the case of water ,",
    "dispersion interaction does not play a major role on the physico - chemical properties of molten lif at a given density .",
    "the melting point is usually considered as a very stringent test of a force - field , since it depends on the relative free energies of the crystal and liquid phases .",
    "the melting point can be determined by creating a cell containing the solid and liquid at coexistence .",
    "the interface has to be constructed by combining two separate bulk simulations of the crystalline and molten phases each equilibrated at the same pressure and the estimated melting temperature  @xcite .",
    "the cell parameters for the liquid phase have to match those of the crystalline simulation .",
    "the two cells are then placed in a supercell , with a large aspect ratio , as shown on figure [ fig : interface ] .",
    "a first estimation of the melting point is obtained _ via _ short simulations performed in the @xmath41 ensemble , before longer simulations are performed in the @xmath25 ensemble . in the first stage",
    ", the system is run for a short period of time ( 1 ps ) in a constant volume simulation with the thermostat set at the estimated coexistence temperature ( or by regular velocity rescaling ) to remove excess energy caused by bringing the solid and liquid together .",
    "great care must be taken during these initial stages to ensure that one or other phase is not destroyed .",
    "once the excessive relaxation energy has been removed , the system can be run on for a further 50 ps in a @xmath41 simulation to ensure complete equilibration .",
    "we then perform a 50  ps production run , again in the @xmath41 ensemble , during which we determine the average temperature and pressure .",
    "other ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) coexistence points can then be sampled by performing additional simulations where the initial kinetic energy of the system is rescaled to a value above that of coexistence and then the system is allowed to re - equilibrate in an @xmath41 simulation  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath43,@xmath42 ) plots for lif at the solid - liquid coexistence for the three sets of dispersion parameters . ]    the variation of @xmath43 versus @xmath42 at coexistence is shown on figure [ fig : meltingpoint ] for the three sets of dispersion parameters . at @xmath44  atm , we obtain approximate melting temperatures of 980  k , 1115  k and 1170  k for the case with null dispersion and with the chf and wannier parameters , respectively .",
    "we then perform long simulations in the @xmath25 ensemble , where the target pressure is set to 1  atm while several target temperatures close to the estimated @xmath45 are studied .",
    "variation of the potential energy ( left ) and cell length along the @xmath46 axis ( right ) at several temperatures during @xmath25 simulations performed at several temperatures . ]",
    "we sample the potential energy and the cell length along the @xmath46 direction during these @xmath25 simulations .",
    "the results are shown on figure [ fig : meltingpoint2 ] .",
    "both quantities remain constant only when the liquid and solid are coexisting  @xcite .",
    "we extract refined melting temperatures of 1000  k , 1108  k and 1170  k for the case with null dispersion and with the chf and wannier parameters , respectively .",
    "this trend is easily understood by the fact that increasing the dispersion effects will result in a stabilization of the most condensed phase , i.e. the solid , with respect to the less condensed phase .",
    "nevertheless , the observed differences are large ( up to @xmath47  k ) despite the fact that no important differences were observed for the single phase structural properties .",
    "the chf case provides a very accurate estimate of the melting point since the experimental value is 1118  k. this result is somewhat surprising since the model using the wannier dispersion parameters provided the best estimate of the densities of both the solid and liquid phases , again showing the difficulty of building a force field of perfect accuracy for all the properties , even if it includes polarization effects .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown in this paper that , although it brings a tiny contribution to the total energy , the dispersion interaction has important effects on the properties of lif . on the one hand , these effects are not observed in fixed volume simulations of the liquid , for which the structure and the dynamics are independent of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 terms . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted equilibrium densities are affected in both the liquid and solid phases : an underestimation of the experimental data by as much as 15  % is observed when dispersion effects are omitted .",
    "but the strongest differences are obtained for the melting point , a quantity which reflects the free energy difference between the solid and liquid phase .",
    "this means that as soon as free energy - related quantities have to be evaluated , special attention must be paid to using a correct parameterization of the dispersion coefficients .    to carry out this parameterization on a purely first - principles basis , which is what we have attempted here ,",
    "is not straightforward .",
    "here we have tested two sets of parameters .",
    "the first one was extracted from condensed - phase coupled hartree fock calculations  @xcite , while the second one was obtained from the determination of the maximally localized wannier functions in a simple condensed phase dft calculation  @xcite .",
    "both of them provide reasonably good predictions for the densities and the melting points , but more systematic calculations on a series of materials would be needed for identifiying the better parameterization procedure .",
    "it is to be expected that the developments which are currently being made for treating accurately dispersion interactions in dft calculations  @xcite will provide useful routes .",
