    "recent x - ray observations of nearby galaxy clusters show that powerful outbursts of their central cd galaxies have imprinted a rich variety of structures onto the x - ray emitting gas ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the amount of energy supplied into the cluster gas by these outbursts can prevent the clusters from cooling @xcite .",
    "the average power released in outbursts exceeds @xmath20  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to the typical radiative power of a quasar .",
    "however , the central cd galaxy is usually observed in a quiescent , non - luminous , state .",
    "the impact of a luminous quasar on the cluster gas has not been widely explored so far .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been known for a long time that powerful radio - loud quasars are associated with rich galaxy environments @xcite , and so we should be able to find luminous radio loud quasars in x - ray - bright clusters . much remains unknown about the details of how quasar activity is triggered , the way in which the accretion proceeds , the impact of the quasar on its galactic and cluster environment , and which physical processes are important as a function of redshift .",
    "x - ray clusters retain the history of the cd activity and studies of quasars in x - ray clusters can provide some answers to these questions .",
    "there have been a few successful searches for the diffuse x - ray cluster emission surrounding powerful quasars and radio galaxies using rosat @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the rosat x - ray data for five quasars located in x - ray clusters , and concluded that simple models for triggering the quasars ( e.g. , cooling flows , a low - pressure ism , or low velocity dispersions ) do not work , suggesting instead that mergers and strong interactions are critical in delivering the gas to the quasar host .",
    "@xcite analyzed a large sample of powerful radio sources and found cases of extended x - ray emission that are likely to be of cluster origin .",
    "however , the number of such cases was limited to eight by rosat s sensitivity and some of these were not confirmed by _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "extended x - ray emission can be associated alternatively with radio structures such as large scale jets , knots , hot spots , and lobes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and disentangling the cluster emission from the other x - ray emission components has been challenging .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory@xcite has both the spatial resolution and the dynamic range necessary to study diffuse x - ray emission in the vicinity of a strong point source , and allows the separation of cluster x - ray emission from that of jets and other structures .",
    "@xcite studied a _",
    "chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ sample of twenty powerful radio sources at @xmath21 , including two core - dominated quasars , and found diffuse x - ray emission in 60% of the sample .",
    "the diffuse emission was faint , but the luminosities were consistent with non - quasar - host x - ray clusters at similar and lower redshifts , and the work found no difference between the cluster environments of quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "we discovered a bright x - ray cluster in a pointed _ chandra _ observation of the radio - loud compact steep spectrum ( css ) quasar 3c186 at the redshift of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this observation , although only @xmath23  ksec long , provided an x - ray luminosity measurement , @xmath24  erg  s@xmath1 , a cluster temperature ( @xmath25  kev ) and a gas - mass fraction ( @xmath26 ) that were typical of other massive , relaxed clusters @xcite .",
    "the 3c186 x - ray cluster is more luminous than the @xcite clusters , and provides a unique opportunity to study a luminous cluster associated with a quasar at high redshift .",
    "the powerful and luminous quasar , @xmath27 erg  s@xmath1 , is located well within the diffuse x - ray emission .    here",
    "we report the results from a 200  ks deep follow - up _ chandra _ observation of 3c186 , made in order to study the quasar and its associated cluster in greater detail .",
    "relatively few massive , relaxed x - ray clusters at @xmath16 are known .",

    "the cluster x - ray morphology indicates that the cluster is well formed and has a cool core with a short central cooling time .",

    "the minimum pressure gives a lower estimate of the instantaneous jet power , e.g. @xmath209  erg or @xmath210  erg  s@xmath1 for the age of the radio source of @xmath211 years .    we note that the bolometric luminosity of 3c186 is equal to @xmath212  erg  s@xmath1 ( see sec.[sec : bhmass ] ) and the 3c186 radiative power exceeds the jet kinetic power by at least a factor of 10 .",

    "quasar radiation energy can also be transferred directly to the cluster gas via compton scattering .",
    "we calculate the energy required to prevent significant cooling of the cluster core in 3c186 following @xcite .",
    "the mass of the gas within the cooling radius of 45  kpc assuming the central density of 0.08  @xmath168 is equal to @xmath214  m@xmath9 .",
    "the amount of energy required to heat this gas is of the order of 1  kev per baryon , e.g. @xmath215  erg .",
    "the observed quasar luminosity of @xmath216  erg  s@xmath1 provides enough energy to heat the cluster core within about 2@xmath217  years if the heating process were 100 percent efficient .",
    "however , the cooling time of the core is much longer , @xmath218  years , and only a very small fraction of the observed luminosity is needed to support the cluster heating within that time .",

    "we also assumed spherical symmetry and if we include a covering factor of 30% that accounts for cold gas in the central regions ( e.g. torus ) , the total number of photons decreases to about 0.3% .",
    "this results in the available instantenous power of @xmath225  erg  s@xmath1 which is equivalent to a total energy of @xmath226  erg available to balance the cluster cooling within 7@xmath227  years .",
    "this is within an order of magnitude of the required energy to balance the cluster cooling .",
    "however , this also requires that the quasar is powered by accreting at 0.25@xmath228 rate , ( e.g. @xmath229  year@xmath1 assuming standard 10% accretion efficiency ) , continuously during the cooling time of the cluster , which results in the final required amount of fuel exceeding by a factor of 4 the current black hole mass .",
    "although such an amount of fuel is only a fraction of the available mass in the cluster core , it is unclear how it can be funneled down to the center within close vicinity of a black hole .",
    "@xcite suggested that the radiation pressure in the luminous quasars will generate a wind , so the radiation energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of the wind and then to the cluster gas via radiative shocks .",
    "this mechanism also requires a large amount of fuel supply .",
    "we should comment here that the young css radio sources , such as 3c186 , might be intermittent on short timescales @xmath230 years if the accretion rates are close to the eddington value .",
    "the source experiences transitions between ( 1 ) a high super - eddington state characterize by a luminous accretion disk and a powerful jet ; and ( 2 ) a quiescent state with the sub - eddington luminosity of the disk and no jet . in this scenario",
    "the super - eddington state should last longer than @xmath189  years for a radio source to grow beyond the host galaxy , as the expansion of the radio source within the host galaxy takes more than @xmath231  years . during that initial time",
    "the luminous quasar can provide enough radiative power to heat up a small cluster core . at later times when the radio source grows beyond the host galaxy and expands within the cluster environment the mechanical energy is directly used to prevent cluster cooling .",
