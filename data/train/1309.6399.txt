    "it is a priori unclear what happens in this derivation for the modified metric of the sme when the @xmath3 terms are included . in particular , it is not clear that this alternative derivation should completely match the method used in reference @xcite , where the spin four - vector @xmath149 was projected along a comoving but not co - rotating set of spatial vectors @xmath150 attached to the satellite . some preliminary calculations for the sme , paralleling those in ref .",
    "@xcite , show that the relativistic precession for the sme that arises in this alternative derivation matches the previously obtained results in equation ( [ bk156 ] ) , after averaging over one gyroscope orbit . as in the gr case , light deflection terms arise when the gyro spin vector is projected along the tangent vector to the incoming starlight . however , the size of the light deflection terms that involve the coefficients @xmath3 are negligible for gpb .",
    "( note that a full analysis of the merits of dedicated light - bending tests for the sme was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    the leading aberration terms that arise in this calculation take the standard form .",
    "specifically we can write the accumulated change in the gyro spin due to aberration as @xmath151 with a similar equation holding for the we direction . to the necessary order",

    "most of these aberration terms , the possible effects from the coefficients @xmath3 would arise through changes in the orbit via the perturbation terms in the equations of motion for the satellite ( [ eom ] ) . if we average these terms over the time scale of the gyroscope orbit , we find that the possible effects due to the coefficients @xmath3 average to zero or are negligible , except for the term in ( [ aberration ] ) that is linear in the earth s velocity @xmath154 .    the coefficients @xmath3 would also perturb the earth s orbit . for the time scale of the experiment , secular changes to the earth s orbit",
    "are irrelevant and so the focus is on determining how oscillatory changes in the earth s orbit might manifest in equation ( [ aberration ] ) .",
    "the conventional annual variation of the leading aberration term is known and has a amplitude of about @xmath156  mas .",
    "the oscillations of the earth s orbit that would arise due to lorentz violation in form of the @xmath3 coefficients , and could affect the velocity @xmath154 and hence equation ( [ aberration ] ) , would include both annual oscillations and twice annual oscillations @xcite .",
    "note that the actual gpb data collection time scale was just shy of one year .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that gpb could be sensitive to a combination of @xmath3 coefficients via the oscillatory orbital effects on the earth s velocity aberration terms . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard time dependence of the conventional aberration term was in fact used by the gpb experiment for calibration @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether constraints on such oscillatory effects could even be garnered from the gpb data .",
    "this issue remains an open question for investigation but we remark that , regardless of this issue , our result constraining @xmath6 would remain unchanged since orbital effects are not sensitive to this coefficient at the post - newtonian order we consider in this work .",
    "we have used measurements of geodetic precession and frame - dragging by gravity probe  b to put the first direct experimental constraint on the time - time coefficient of lorentz violation ( @xmath6 ) in the standard - model extension .",
    "this coefficient controls lorentz - violating effects associated with relativistic , post - newtonian gravitational effects , and can also be measured by experiments involving light trajectories @xcite .",
    "because the new constraint is linearly independent of existing limits on the spatial coefficients @xmath90 , it allows us to obtain individual upper bounds on @xmath157 and @xmath5 for the first time .",
    "these upper bounds strengthen slightly when a rescaling of newton s gravitational constant in the theory is taken into account .",
    "our final upper bounds on the sme coefficients are given in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "we have also considered orbital effects .",
    "our preliminary results suggest that these do not significantly affect the geodetic constraint from gpb , but can greatly strengthen the frame - dragging one , as given in eq .",
    "( [ gpbconstraintrevisedagain ] ) , so that it almost becomes competitive with laboratory limits on some of the spatial coefficients @xmath90 .",
    "if these results are confirmed , then frame - dragging would appear to be an unexpectedly sensitive probe of lorentz violation .",
    "this possibility should be investigated further .",
    "for instance , the inclusion of the earth s quadrupole moment , both the conventional one from its rotation and a possible lorentz - violating contribution due to spherical deformation , could affect the results in this work . also open for investigation",
