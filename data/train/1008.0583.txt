    "the same is true for @xmath424 , and @xmath786    [ congruences ] suppose @xmath424 has a local maximum at an interior point @xmath555 of @xmath787 , where @xmath788 .",
    "furthermore , suppose @xmath424 vanishes at all corners of norm @xmath615 , for some @xmath615 with @xmath789 .",
    "then all the @xmath56 are congruent modulo @xmath11 , and @xmath790 the same conclusion holds if @xmath791 , provided the distance from each of the corners of norm @xmath792 to @xmath555 is @xmath793 .",
    "the local maximum @xmath555 can be within distance @xmath792 of at most one of the corners of norm @xmath615 ; corollary [ cor to main lemma ] gives a linear congruence modulo @xmath11 for each of the @xmath794 or @xmath795 corners of norm @xmath615 that are `` far '' from @xmath555 .",
    "for each @xmath796 there are two congruences that differ only by the signs of @xmath56 and @xmath797 ( more precisely , there are @xmath798 or @xmath799 such pairs ) .",
    "subtracting one such congruence from the other we find that @xmath800 , and since @xmath541 , @xmath801 . substituting that into any of the congruences we find @xmath802 , giving the result .",
    "if @xmath791 , the same argument applies , but we need congruences associated to _ all _ corners of norm 1 , hence the need for the extra assumption",
    ".    we can now conclude the proof of theorem [ bounds1 ] .",
    "as pointed out in section [ reductions ] , we may assume @xmath803 and @xmath513 , and an inductive argument allows us to restrict our attention to interior points .",
    "aiming at a contradiction , suppose @xmath424 has a local maximum at an interior point @xmath555 , where it takes on a value @xmath556 .",
    "we would like to arrange a situation where we can use lemma [ congruences ] . by using a reflection , which changes the @xmath56 ( modulo @xmath11 ) only by a sign",
    ", we may assume that the restriction of @xmath424 to the corners of @xmath42 attains its maximum value at the origin ; let @xmath804 .",
    "note that if @xmath805 , then @xmath424 is linear and its only local maximum is at the origin , while if @xmath806 then @xmath424 is piecewise linear with local maxima only at the origin and its opposite corner . in either case , the existence of the local maximum at @xmath555 is contradicted ; so henceforth we assume @xmath807 .",
    "theorem [ max - corner ] then shows that @xmath424 vanishes at all corners of norm @xmath615 .",
    "difficulties may arise if @xmath791 , as lemma [ congruences ] would then require the distance between @xmath555 and each corner of norm 1 to be @xmath793 .",
    "but these difficulties may be dealt with by using further reflections .",
    "suppose , for instance , that @xmath808 .",
    "since the maximum value that @xmath424 takes on at the corners is 1 , @xmath424 vanishes at all corners with an odd norm .",
    "the distance between @xmath555 and each such corner other than @xmath418 is @xmath793 .",
    "replacing @xmath333 with @xmath809 we arrive at the desired situation : @xmath424 now vanishes at all corners of norm 1 , and the distance between @xmath555 and each of these corners is @xmath793 .",
    "lemma [ congruences ] can thus be used even if @xmath791 .",
    "( note that what made it possible for us to get around the difficulties was the existence of an extra `` layer '' of zeros of @xmath424 , namely the corners of norm 3 . )    applying lemma [ congruences ] we obtain @xmath810 since situation 2 of lemma [ pl or vanishes at another layer ] contradicts the existence of the local maximum at @xmath555 , we may assume that @xmath424 also vanishes at a corner of norm @xmath773 .",
    "if the distance from @xmath555 to that corner is @xmath793 , corollary [ cor to main lemma ] gives us another congruence @xmath811 ; together with ( [ cong2 ] ) , this shows that @xmath11 divides @xmath56 , a contradiction . if the distance between @xmath555 and that corner is @xmath812 , then @xmath813 , since that distance is at least @xmath814 , and @xmath788 .",
    "so @xmath11 can not divide @xmath815 , and ( [ cong2 ] ) gives us a contradiction , _ unless _",
    "@xmath816 , in which case ( [ cong2 ] ) is of no help .",
    "it remains to deal with the case @xmath816 . in this case , among all corners with norm @xmath817 we choose a corner @xmath381 where @xmath424 is maximum ; let @xmath818 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath819 , as otherwise we would be in situation 2 of lemma [ pl or vanishes at another layer ] .",
    "if @xmath820 , we use a reflection to bring @xmath381 to the origin , and conclude the proof by arguing exactly as above . if @xmath821 we do the same , with some extra care  we need to choose @xmath381 with @xmath822 .",
    "this ensures that all corners at distance 1 or 3 from @xmath381 have norm @xmath817 , so that @xmath424 vanishes at all those corners , guaranteeing that extra `` layer '' of zeros needed for the workaround in the third paragraph of the proof .",
    "finding a @xmath381 satisfying this extra requirement is not a problem unless @xmath254 , in which case we run into fatal difficulties .",
    "but if @xmath254 , then in the situation considered here @xmath823 has a maximum at the origin , where @xmath824 , and @xmath392 , so @xmath333 is a special cell class , hence already handled in the beginning of this section .",
