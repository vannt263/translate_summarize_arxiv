    "they proved that all 3-connected , diameter 2 graphs are class 0 , and conjectured that fixed diameter graphs with large enough connectivity are also class 0 .",
    "this conjecture was proved in @xcite , where the result was used to prove that the random graph in which each edge appears independently with probability @xmath28 for some @xmath29 is almost surely class 0 .",

    "of course , @xmath154 ( @xmath155 since otherwise we could place 4 pebbles on @xmath17 ) , and @xmath156 .",

    "henceforth we may assume that @xmath162 for all @xmath20 .",
    "consequently the equality @xmath163 tells us that @xmath164 , and so @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , again without loss of generality , @xmath166 , say @xmath167 .",
    "if @xmath155 then we may copy the above argument that @xmath168 implies @xmath133 .",
    "otherwise we may move a pebble from @xmath161 through @xmath169 to @xmath17 , find @xmath170 and use the original argument for the case that @xmath140 .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim .",
    "now we can use the relations @xmath171 to see that @xmath172 so that @xmath173 . from this",
    "we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath174 , so that the number of edges with one end in @xmath131 is more than @xmath175 .",
    "since @xmath4 there must be some @xmath176 having at least 8 neighbors in @xmath131 , so that we can put 8 pebbles on @xmath19 , a contradiction .",
    "we define , for each @xmath9 , the graph @xmath56 as follows .",
    "let the vertex set @xmath178 , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "let the induced subgraphs on @xmath114 and on @xmath181 each be complete with one missing edge .",
    "suppose the edge @xmath88 is missing from the subgraph on @xmath114 , and the edge @xmath91 is missing from the subgraph on @xmath181 .",
    "finally include the two edges @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "note that for @xmath182 the graph @xmath56 has minimum degree @xmath6 , and is @xmath6-regular when @xmath9 is even .",
    "next we define a configuration @xmath16 of size @xmath183 , and show that it is unsolvable when @xmath2 .",
    "we choose the root @xmath184 and define @xmath99 .",
    "we find @xmath185 and define @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "finally we define @xmath103 for all other vertices @xmath20 . clearly , @xmath104 .    in order that @xmath16 is @xmath25-solvable one must be able to move 2 pebbles onto either @xmath105 or @xmath106 , and consequently 4 pebbles onto either @xmath19 or @xmath107 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that both cases are impossible .",

    "let @xmath0 be graph with minimum degree @xmath3 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath0 is not class 0 and derive a contradiction . because complete graphs are class 0",
    ", @xmath0 has diameter at least 2 , and because every pair of vertices of @xmath0 has a common neighbor , the diameter of @xmath0 is exactly 2 .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that every graph @xmath0 of diameter two has pebbling number @xmath189 or @xmath190 ( _ class 1 _ ) . in @xcite",
    "we find the following characterization of class 1 graphs of diameter two ( see figure [ class1 ] ) .    in the figure",
    ", @xmath191 is any ( possibly empty ) graph , @xmath192 is any nonempty graph , and @xmath193 and @xmath194 are any nonempty connected graphs .",
    "the solid lines indicate an edge from the given vertex to every vertex in the corresponding set .",
    "at least two of the three dashed lines must be present , and the arrows indicate that every vertex in @xmath191 must have at least one edge to @xmath195 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is labeled as in figure [ class1 ] .",
    "choose any vertices @xmath196 , and recall that @xmath197 denotes the neighborhood of a vertex @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath198 is not an edge , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , we have @xmath201 , and so at least one of @xmath202 or @xmath203 has degree smaller than @xmath3 , a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath0 is class 0 .        in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ dt2 ] .",
    "the proof is divided into two steps .",
    "first , we will show that it is possible to partition the vertices of @xmath205 into @xmath206 subgraphs of diameter at most two .",
    "second , we prove that if a distribution has enough pebbles then there will be in every subgraph `` many '' vertices with two pebbles each .",
    "the following procedure constructs a @xmath212-star partition @xmath213 of @xmath208 with @xmath214 .",
    "select @xmath215 arbitrarily and let @xmath216 . for a general step ,",
    "suppose @xmath217 have been selected and let @xmath218 .",
    "either every vertex from @xmath219 has a neighbor in @xmath210 for some @xmath220 , in which case we stop the process with @xmath221 and @xmath222 , or there is a vertex @xmath223 such that @xmath224 . in the latter case",
    "we set @xmath225 and continue the process .",
    "assume that @xmath226 with @xmath227 and let @xmath16 be a pebbling distribution with @xmath228 pebbles where @xmath229 is such that @xmath230 . consider the random variable @xmath231 , which is equal to one if @xmath232 and zero otherwise , and let @xmath233 .",
    "then @xmath234 = \\frac{{t+n-4 \\choose t-2}}{{t+n-1 \\choose t}}\\ ; \\ ] ] using the assumptions about @xmath17 and @xmath9 it is easy to check that @xmath235 \\leq \\e[x_{ij}]\\e[x_{ik}]$ ] for @xmath236 . consequently @xmath237",

    "but , with our choice of @xmath17 and @xmath9 , @xmath242 = \\w\\(\\frac{\\d t^2}{n^2}\\ )      = \\w\\(\\frac{\\w^2 n}{\\d}\\)\\ .\\ ] ] thus , with probability tending to one , for all @xmath243 , we have @xmath244/2 $ ] , which is at least 8 for large enough @xmath9 .",
