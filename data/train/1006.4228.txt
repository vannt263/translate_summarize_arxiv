    "thanks to its simplicity , robustness and cost effectiveness , wireless local area networks ( wlans ) based on ieee 802.11 distributed control function ( dcf ) are playing a major role in next - generation home networks and hot spots .",
    "the recent explosion of broadband wireless services has stimulated considerable research interests in understanding how fast data can be sent through a wlan . since the seminal work of bianchi in @xcite , there have been extensive efforts to characterize throughput performance of wlans under saturation condition , where stations always have packets to transmit @xcite . by contrast ,",
    "wlan throughput in a non - saturated case is more complicated and less well understood , despite substantial recent efforts .",
    "notably , there has been a common misconception that in a non - saturated case , wlan can sustain a traffic load as high as saturation throughput while providing satisfactory quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "this misconception is backed up by recent work in @xcite which observed a throughput higher than saturation throughput before the network is saturated . in this paper , we argue that this misconception may lead to unbounded delay moments , which is not acceptable to most applications . in particular , our analysis reveals the facts that ( i ) the  pre - saturation throughput peak \" observed in @xcite only occurs under certain settings of backoff parameters ; ( ii ) under many other circumstances , it is necessary to operate a wlan _ far below _ the saturation load to avoid unbounded mean packet delay and delay jitter .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to answer the following important questions : ( i ) how much throughput can be sustained subject to finite mean delay and delay jitter in non - saturated wlans ; and ( ii ) how to maximize this throughput . to this end",
    ", we make the following contributions :    * by investigating the operating point of dcf wlan , we reveal the conditions under which the  pre - saturation throughput peak \" may occur .",
    "we show that this phenomenon is not true in general , except for certain backoff parameter settings . *",
    "we propose a multiple - vacation queueing model to derive the explicit expressions for the probability distribution ( in terms of transform ) of packet delay .",
    "in contrast to existing work , our model captures the heavy - tail property of the probability distribution . *",
    "based on the heavy - tail delay distribution , we establish sufficient and necessary conditions for mean delay and delay jitter to be bounded . notably , saturation throughput is no longer sufficient to characterize the network capacity in the unsaturated case , because mean delay and delay jitter may become unbounded prior to saturation . to bridge the gap",
    ", we define safe - bounded - mean - delay ( sbmd ) throughput and safe - bounded - delay - jitter ( sbdj ) throughput as the maximum throughputs that can be safely sustained with finite mean delay and delay jitter , respectively . *",
    "ieee 802.11 dcf protocol adopts a backoff exponent @xmath0 in its exponential backoff ( eb ) mechanism .",
    "that is , when packets collide , the collision windows of the involved stations are doubled . in this paper , we show that oftentimes @xmath0 is not the optimal choice in terms of maximizing sbmd and sbdj throughputs .",
    "in addition , compared with saturation throughput , sbmd and sbdj throughputs are more sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "that is , one should be more careful in setting the right @xmath1 to avoid severe degradation of throughput .",
    "this paper shows how the optimal @xmath1 can be computed to maximize sbmd and sbdj throughputs . * in conventional wlans ,",
    "collision of packets occurs when more than one station transmits at the same time . with advanced phy - layer signal processing techniques , it is possible for a receiver to detect multiple packets simultaneously without causing collisions in future wlans .",
    "for example , in cdma or multiple - antenna systems , multiple packets can be received simultaneously using multiuser detection ( mud ) techniques @xcite .",
    "this new collision model is referred to as multi - packet reception ( mpr ) , as opposed to single - packet reception ( spr ) in traditional wlans .",
    "our prior work in @xcite shows that mpr can greatly enhance the capacity of wlans : saturation throughput scales super - linearly with the mpr capability of the channel . in this paper",
    ", we extend the investigation to the non - saturation case and show that the maximum sbmd and sbdj throughputs also scale super - linearly with the mpr capability . that is , sbmd and sbdj throughputs divided by @xmath2 increases with @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the maximum number of packets that can be resolved simultaneously .",
    "super - linear throughput scaling implies that the achievable throughput per unit cost increases with the mpr capability of the channel .",
    "this , together with our previous work in @xcite , provides a strong incentive to deploy mpr in next generation wireless networks .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that a large @xmath2 can decrease the sensitivity of sbmd and sbdj throughputs to @xmath1 .",
    "this provides another incentive to deploy mpr : the system is more robust against imprecise @xmath1 setting .",
    "previous work on delay analysis can be divided into two main threads : medium - access delay of head - of - line ( hol ) packets under saturation condition and queueing delay ( also referred to as packet delay hereafter ) under non - saturation condition . in saturated systems ,",
    "mean medium - access delay is easily derived as the reciprocal of saturation throughput @xcite .",
    "more recently , sakurai and vu derived moments and generating function of medium - access delay under saturation .",
    "it was found that the eb mechanism induces a heave - tailed delay distribution .",
    "similar observation was also made by yang and yum in @xcite when binary eb is deployed . in this paper , we show that in unsaturated wlans , packet delay distribution also exhibits a heavy - tail behavior .",
    "it is for precisely this reason that the sustainable throughput subject to finite mean delay and delay jitter may differ from the saturation throughput .",
    "packet delay under non - saturation condition has recently been analyzed in @xcite using different techniques .",
    "unfortunately , none of these analyses captures the heavy - tail characteristics of packet delay distribution . in this sense , the multiple - vacation queueing model proposed in this paper more accurately",
    "reflects the behavior of unsaturated wlans .",
    "recent work in @xcite investigated the throughput performance under non - saturated operation .",
    "notably , all the papers observed that a throughput higher than the saturation throughput occurs when network is not saturated . in this paper , we explain this phenomenon by analyzing the relationship between system operation point and saturation condition .",
    "in particular , it is shown that this phenomenon only exists in certain special cases . moreover , even in these special cases , it is not wise to load the system with a traffic load higher than saturation throughput in practice , as such a traffic load can not be safely sustained in the long run . on another front , @xcite has analyzed system throughput in a more realistic scenario where voip and tcp traffics coexist in the network .",
    "the work mentioned above are all based on spr collision model .",
    "previous work on delay analysis in unsaturated mpr networks has focused on pure slotted aloha systems @xcite .",
    "apart from the underlying mac protocol , a major difference between this paper and @xcite lies in the definition of mpr . in @xcite ,",
    "average delay is characterized for a subclass of mpr channels , namely capture channels , where at most one user has a successful packet transmission when multiple packets contend for the channel at the same time . in @xcite ,",
    "chan and berger analyzed the mean medium access delay for csma networks with mpr under saturation condition .",
    "similar to @xcite , the mean medium access delay is the reciprocal of saturation throughput in this case .      similar",
    "to saturation analysis , most prior work on non - saturation analysis assumed that a station encounters a collision probability @xmath3 when it transmits , regardless of _ its own _ backoff stage and buffer state @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , the transmission probability @xmath4 of an _ arbitrary _ station in a _",
    "generic _ time slot is assumed to be constant and does not vary with the backoff stage and buffer state of a particular tagged station .",
    "this assumption is shown to be quite accurate when there are sufficient number of stations in the system . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt the same assumption and will discuss its impact on model accuracy in section v - b . to validate this assumption",
    ", we simulate @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ validation ] for the case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 packets per second .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath3 is largely independent of the backoff stage and buffer occupancy .",
    "in particular , the average variance of @xmath3 across buffer occupancy is about @xmath7 and that across backoff stage is about @xmath8 . despite this assumption , our model factors in the dependency of transmission probability of the tagged station on its backoff stage .",
    "it is this distinct feature of our model that enables us to capture the heavy - tail behavior of delay distribution .",
    "another assumption is that mobile stations keep monitoring the status of channel even when they have zero backlog in their queues .",
    "when a new packet arrives at an empty queue , it will start a backoff process at the beginning of the time slot that immediately follows .",
    "this assumption is slightly different from the standard ieee 802.11 dcf .",
    "however , it makes our model sufficiently simple to obtain explicit expressions for quantities of interest , while still captures the dominant behaviors of non - saturated wlans .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the eb mechanism and the calculation of saturation throughput .",
    "system operation under non - saturation condition is discussed in section iii , where we establish the condition under which the system remains unsaturated . in section iv ,",
    "packet delay in eb - based wlan is analyzed through an @xmath9 model .",
    "sbmd and sbdj throughputs are defined in section v , where we also show that the maximum sbmd and sbdj throughputs scale super - linearly with the mpr capability of the network . in section",
    "vi , numerical results of two example systems are given to further illustrate our analysis . in section vii",
    ", we extend our discussions to systems with a retry limit or a maximum contention window .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section viii .     for @xmath5 and @xmath6 packets per slot.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we consider a fully - connected network with @xmath10 stations .",
    "the transmission of stations is coordinated by an eb mechanism .",
    "the eb mechanism adaptively tunes the transmission probability of a station according to the traffic intensity of the network .",
    "it works as follows . at each packet transmission ,",
    "a station sets its backoff timer by randomly choosing an integer within the range @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the size of the contention window .",
    "the backoff timer is decreased by one following each time slot .",
    "the station transmits a packet from its buffer once the backoff timer reaches zero . at the first transmission attempt of a packet , @xmath12",
    "is set to @xmath13 , the minimum contention window .",
    "each time the transmission is unsuccessful , @xmath12 is multiplied by a backoff factor @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the contention window size @xmath14 after @xmath15 successive transmission failures . for simplicity , we assume there is no retry limit in our system . however , our analysis can be easily extended to the case with a retry limit .",
    "thanks to advanced phy - layer signal processing techniques , we assume that the channel has the capability to accommodate up to @xmath2 simultaneous packet transmissions . in other words , packets can be received correctly whenever the number of simultaneous transmissions is no larger than @xmath2 . when more than @xmath2 stations contend for the channel at the same time , collision occurs and no packet can be decoded .",
    "by letting @xmath16 , the system reduces to a traditional spr wlan .",
    "our previous work in @xcite has proposed one approach to implement mpr in ieee 802.11 wlans .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the probability that a station transmits in a generic time slot .",
    "the probability of having @xmath17 stations transmit in a generic time slot is given by @xmath18 it is then straightforward to calculate the probabilities that a generic time slot is an idle slot , collision slot , and success slot in the following equations , where the superscript @xmath19 in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 stands for `` generic '' .",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 given - , wlan throughput @xmath26 , defined as the average number of information bits successfully transmitted per second , is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denote the lengths of success , collision , and idle slots , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 denotes the payload length of a packet . according to",
    ", throughput @xmath26 can be plotted as a function of transmission probability @xmath4 .",
    "one such example when @xmath16 and @xmath32 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - tau ] .",
    "the figure shows that the maximum throughput , @xmath33 , occurs when @xmath4 is given by @xmath34    it is well known that under _ saturation _ condition where stations are continuously backlogged , transmission probability @xmath4 is the root of a fixed - point system @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the probability that a station encounters collisions when it transmits , which is given by @xmath36 to distinguish from the non - saturation case , we denote @xmath4 in the saturation case by @xmath37 in the rest of the paper .",

    "[ fig : s - tau ] , @xmath41 lies to the left of the peak @xmath42 when @xmath0 .",

    "under non - saturation , queues of stations are empty from time to time .",
    "assume that packets arrive at each station according to a poisson process at a rate of @xmath43 packets per second .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the probability that a queue is non - empty and @xmath45 denote the probability that a station with non - zero backlog transmits in a generic time slot .",
    "then , the probability that a station transmits in a generic time slot , @xmath4 , is linked to @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",

    "the details are omitted due to the page limit .    unlike saturation operation",
    ", system throughput under non - saturation condition is always equal to the input traffic rate when the system is in a steady state , implying that the system is unsaturated and queues are empty from time to time . ] .",
    "that is , @xmath49 solving yields the transmission probability @xmath4 .",
    "a close observation of reveals the fact that unlike the saturation case , @xmath4 in the non - saturation case only depends on @xmath50 and is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath1 does have an effect on the saturation throughput @xmath38 , which in turn determines whether a system can remain unsaturated under @xmath50 .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : nlambda ] , there could be two roots to , denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "however , theorem [ theorem1 ] shows that only the root that is smaller than @xmath37 can be the system operating point under steady state .",
    "[ theorem1 ] a @xmath4 can be a steady - state operating point of wlans if and only if @xmath53 .    the proof is given in appendix a. in the proof , we make use of some results that are derived in later sections .",
    "readers are suggested to read the proof later after going through section iv .",
    "theorem [ theorem1 ] suggests that the network can remain unsaturated ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , as long as @xmath53 .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath55 , it is possible to have @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nlambda ] ) , implying the system can be unsaturated while having a throughput higher than @xmath38 .",
    "this explains the  pre - saturation throughput peak \" observation in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that such phenomenon only occurs when the backoff parameters yield a @xmath37 larger than @xmath58 ( if @xmath59 , @xmath56 yields @xmath60 , implying that the system can not be stable in this case according to theorem [ theorem1 ] . ) . in other words , it is not a general rule applicable to all wlan settings .    , @xmath61 , ( b ) @xmath56 , @xmath57,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "to understand how much throughput is sustainable subject to bounded delay moment requirements , we analyze packet delay of unsaturated wlan in this section . in a fully connected network , each station sees the same environment .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to analyze the delay performance by investigating the queueing dynamic at one ( arbitrarily chosen ) tagged station .",
    "packet delay is composed of two parts : _ waiting time and medium - access delay_. in particular , waiting time denotes the time interval from the arrival of a packet to the instant when the packet becomes a hol packet in the queue , and medium - access delay denotes the time period from the instant when the packet becomes a hol packet to the instant at which the packet is successfully transmitted .",
    "there is a strong temptation to model the system by an @xmath62 queue with medium - access delay being the service time .",
    "however , as we will elaborate in subsection iv - a and iv - b , the distribution of medium - access delay experienced by a packet depends on the buffer state seen by the packet upon its arrival .",
    "consequently , the @xmath62 queueing model , which assumes service time is independent of buffer states , can not be directly applied .",
    "a packet arriving at a non - empty queue becomes a hol packet immediately after the preceding packet is successfully transmitted ( assume the difs succeeding the transmission of the previous packet is included in the transmission time ) .",
    "once it becomes a hol packet , it starts a backoff process and attempts to access the channel whenever the backoff counter reaches zero . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delayillustration]a , there are three events that contribute to the medium - access delay : backoff timer countdown , collisions involving the tagged station , and successful transmissions of the tagged station . in particular , the backoff process consists of initial backoff and the backoff periods following unsuccessful transmissions of the tagged station .",

    "we have derived an explicit expression for the distribution ( in transform ) of packet delay .",
    "the analysis establishes sufficient and necessary conditions for mean delay and delay jitter to be bounded : @xmath130 and @xmath133 for bounded mean delay ; and @xmath130 and @xmath135 for bounded delay jitter , respectively .",
    "this result implies that the mean packet delay and delay jitter can go to infinity even if the system is not saturated .",
    "based on the analysis , we define sbmd and sbdj throughputs to be the maximum throughput that can safely guarantee bounded mean delay and delay jitter . these are arguably more sensible definitions of throughput for delay - sensitive applications .",
    "to maximize sbmd ( resp .",
    "sbdj ) throughputs , the backoff factor @xmath1 should be carefully chosen for given @xmath2 and slot lengths .",
    "our results show that under some circumstances , the widely adopted binary eb where @xmath0 yields a throughput that is far from optimum .    together with our previous work on mpr wlans ,",
    "this paper has completed the demonstration of mpr as a powerful capacity - enhancement technique for both delay - sensitive and delay - tolerant applications .",
    "firstly , the maximum sbmd and sbdj throughputs are shown to scale super - linearly with mpr capability @xmath2 .",
    "that is , throughput per unit cost increases with @xmath2 in mpr wlans .",
    "secondly , the sensitivity of sbmd and sbdj throughputs with respect to backoff factor @xmath1 decreases for large @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that an mpr system is more robust against suboptimality in the selection of @xmath1 .    in the paper",
    ", we have demonstrated the  unsafeness \" of loading the system with a traffic load higher than saturation throughput , even when the sufficient and necessary condition for bounded delay moments is satisfied .",
    "an interesting future research direction is to devise mechanisms to  safely \" sustain a throughput higher than saturation throughput .",
    "the simulation results in @xcite suggested that limiting buffer size to a small value could be an effective approach to convert an unsafe throughput to a safe one .",
    "alternatively , regulating input traffic is another possible approach .",
    "the key idea in the design of  safening \" mechanisms is to allow buffers to be empty from time to time so that the system remains unsaturated .    99 ieee standard for wireless lan medium access control ( mac ) and physical layer ( phy ) specifications , iso / iec 8802 - 11 : 1999(e ) , 1999 .",
