    "the observed x - ray emission from low - stellar mass ( @xmath12 ) early - type galaxies is usually determined by the population of lmxbs , whose typical luminosity is in the range of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "additionally , diffuse emission is also present , whose origin can be twofold .",
    "on the one hand , fraction of the ( or up to the entire ) diffuse emission originates from faint ( @xmath14 ) unresolved compact objects , mostly coronally active binaries ( abs ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", truly diffuse x - ray emission may also be present from sub - kev temperature ionized interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the x - ray emitting components of ngc4342 , a low - stellar mass lenticular ( s0 ) galaxy @xcite with an @xmath6@xmath15 gyrs old stellar population .",
    "the major motivations of this study are ( 1 ) to understand the nature and physical properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in and around ngc4342 and ( 2 ) to explore the population of resolved sources . to carry out the analysis we rely on deep _ chandra _ x - ray observations of ngc4342 .",
    "the sub - arcsecond angular resolution of _ chandra _ permits us to resolve bright lmxbs even in the central regions of the galaxy with high source density .",
    "therefore the diffuse emission can be separated from the population of lmxbs , allowing us to perform in - depth studies of the various x - ray emitting components .",
    "a peculiar property of ngc4342 is that it hosts an unusually massive black hole relative to its low bulge mass @xcite , yielding one of the highest black hole - to - bulge mass ratios in the local universe @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied the origin of this discrepancy between the massive black hole and the low bulge mass in ngc4342 @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that the galaxy has a massive dark matter halo extending well beyond the optical size of the galaxy .",
    "the existence of a dark matter halo led us to conclude that the high black hole - to - bulge mass ratio is not the result of tidal stripping , in which the dominant fraction of the stellar population of ngc4342 was removed .",
    "instead , ngc4342 formed as a low stellar mass system with a massive black hole , implying that the black hole and bulge did not grow in tandem @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in projection ngc4342 is located in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , @xmath16 southwest from m87 , the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "the large - scale dss r - band image , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dss_big ] , reveals a large galaxy density in the vicinity of ngc4342 . besides a number of low - mass galaxies , the massive elliptical galaxy , ngc4365 ,",
    "is located @xmath17 to the northeast of ngc4342 .",
    "the large galaxy density and the presence of substructure around ngc4365 has already been recognized by @xcite , who designated this substructure as the @xmath18 cloud . in his morphological and kinematical study of the virgo cluster , @xcite raised and studied the possibility that the @xmath18 cloud is not part of the virgo cluster , but is a galaxy group behind the cluster . in a more recent study ,",
    "@xcite measured the distances of several galaxies associated with the @xmath18 cloud using the surface brightness fluctuation method , and concluded that those galaxies lie at a distance of @xmath19 mpc .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that ngc4365 , which is presumably the most massive galaxy and hence the center of the group , is located at a distance of @xmath20 mpc .",
    "thus , the @xmath18 cloud while projected on the virgo cluster , but lies @xmath6@xmath21 mpc behind it at a distance of @xmath6@xmath22 mpc . although ngc4365 is a relatively x - ray faint giant elliptical @xcite , a recent study by @xcite demonstrated that its gc population extends well beyond the optical extent of the galaxy . in particular ,",
    "the population of blue gcs , which are believed to trace the dark matter halos of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , extend out to at least @xmath23 kpc @xcite .",
    "this indicates that ngc4365 presumably resides in a massive dark matter halo , hence it is feasible that the galaxy is the center of the @xmath18 cloud .",
    "moreover , in sect .",
    "[ sec : edge ] we discuss that ngc4342 is falling with supersonic velocity towards ngc4365 , hence ngc4342 is also likely to belong the @xmath18 cloud .",
    "therefore we assume in the further discussion that ngc4342 is located at @xmath24 mpc . at this distance",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26 pc .",
    "although ngc4342 most likely belongs to the @xmath18 cloud behind virgo cluster , in the absence of accurate distance measurements , we can not exclude the possibility that it is part of the ngc4472 sub - group of the virgo cluster at a distance of @xmath6@xmath27 mpc .",
    "ngc4472 , the dominant member of the sub - group , is located at @xmath28@xmath29 towards the northeast of ngc4342 , which corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath6@xmath30 kpc .",
    "we stress that while varying the distance of ngc4342 from @xmath22 mpc ( if associated with the @xmath18 cloud ) to @xmath27 mpc ( if associated with the virgo cluster ) changes some of the quantities computed throughout the paper , none of our major conclusions are affected .",
    "the galactic column density towards ngc4342 is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 ellipse of ngc4342 has major and minor axis radii of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 kpc ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 kpc ) , and the major axis position angle is @xmath36 . throughout the paper",

    "3 we study the nature and physical properties of the diffuse x - ray emission , and investigate the dynamics of ngc4342 .",
    "the population of resolved point sources is examined in sect .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",
    "ngc4342 was observed twice by _ chandra _ on 2005 february 11 for 38.8 ks ( obs i d : 4687 ) and on 2011 february 17 for 73.7 ks ( obs i d : 12955 ) with the acis - s detector .",
    "the data reduction was performed using standard ciao software package tools ( ciao version 4.3 ; caldb version 4.4.2 ) .",
    "the main steps in the data analyis are those outlined in @xcite . after filtering flare",
    "contaminated time intervals , the total remaining exposure time was 78.8 ks .",
    "the data were combined by projecting the shorter observation into the coordinate system of obs i d 12955 .",
    "point sources were detected with the ciao wavdetect tool in the @xmath40 kev energy range .",
    "for the point source detection the unfiltered merged data was used , the longer exposure time , obtained without omitting periods of high background , allowed a more sensitive detection of point sources .",
    "the spatial scales on which we searched for sources were the @xmath41-series from 1.0 to 8.0 .",
    "additionally , we changed a number of parameters from their default values , in particular we set the value of eenergy to @xmath42 , maxiter to @xmath43 , iterstop to @xmath44 , and ellsigma to @xmath45 . as a result we obtained relatively large source cells , which include @xmath46 of the source counts .",
    "the resulting source list was used to study the population of bright x - ray sources and to mask out the point sources for further study of the diffuse emission .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    to correct for vignetting and to estimate source detection sensitivities , exposure maps were produced using a power law model for the source emission with a slope of @xmath47 , typical for lmxbs @xcite . assuming this spectrum and 7 photons as a detection threshold , the source detection sensitivity of the combined observation is @xmath6@xmath48 .",
    "the x - ray energy spectra of the diffuse emission were extracted using the specextract tool of ciao .    for the study of the unresolved emission ,",
    "the use of local background was not possible , since the diffuse emission fills the entire field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "therefore we relied on `` blank - sky '' observations to subtract the sky and instrumental background components . to account for variations in the normalization of the instrumental background , we normalized the background level using the @xmath49 kev band count rate ratios .",
    "the temperature map was derived using the method described by @xcite .",
    "for each temperature map pixel , we extracted a spectrum from a circular region containing a minimum of @xmath50 net counts in the @xmath51 kev energy range .",
    "the resulting spectra were fitted with an absorbed apec model with xspec , with an abundance fixed at @xmath52 solar @xcite .",
    "since the near - infrared images of the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) large galaxy atlas ( lga ) @xcite are excellent stellar mass tracers , we relied on the 2mass k - band data for this purpose .",
    "the k - band images of ngc4342 are not background subtracted , therefore nearby regions off the galaxy were used to estimate the background level . to convert the counts of the k - band image to luminosity",
    ", we assumed that the absolute k - band magnitude of the sun is @xmath53 mag .",
    "the total k - band luminosity of ngc4342 within the @xmath3 ellipse is @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath2 kev band _ chandra _ image of ngc4342 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra_soft ] ) unveils the presence of diffuse emission associated with the galaxy , which has a significantly broader distribution than the stellar light .",
    "while @xmath6@xmath55 of the k - band light of ngc4342 is located within an @xmath56 kpc elliptical region , the diffuse x - ray emission of ngc4342 extends to @xmath57 kpc .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of the unresolved soft - band x - ray emission is not associated with the stellar population but originates from hot ionized gas .    to characterize the physical properties of the diffuse emission , we extract its energy spectrum within the @xmath3 ellipse and within a circular region with @xmath58 radius centered at ra : 12h23m36.66s ; dec : + 07d02m35.02s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] left panel ) .",
    "we fit the x - ray spectra with a two component model consisting of an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( apec in xspec ) and a power law model .",
    "the former component describes the hot x - ray emitting gas , whereas the latter describes the emission from the population of unresolved lmxbs and unresolved faint compact objects ( section [ sec : hardband ] ) .",
    "the column density was fixed at the galactic value and the abundance was set free to vary .",
    "the applied model fits the spectra well . below @xmath6@xmath59 kev energy the spectra",
    "are dominated by the thermal component , thereby confirming the gaseous nature of the x - ray emission .",
    "the best fit temperature and abundance of the hot gas within the @xmath3 ellipse is @xmath60 kev and @xmath61 solar @xcite . within the larger circular region",
    "we obtained similar values , namely @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 solar abundance @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emitting gas is approximately isothermal within the studied @xmath58 region . from the emission measure ( @xmath64 ) of the hot gas",
    ", the gas mass can be estimated . within the @xmath3 ellipse we obtain @xmath65 mass and an average number density of @xmath66 .",
    "in the circular region , that includes large fraction of the hot gas associated with ngc4342 , we calculate a gas mass of @xmath67 and an average number density of @xmath68 .    from the best - fit spectra we find the total @xmath2 kev band x - ray luminosity of the diffuse emission . within the @xmath3 ellipse",
    "we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "given the total k - band luminosity of ngc4342 , @xmath54 , the x - ray - to - k - band luminosity ratio of the galaxy is @xmath70 . within the circular region with @xmath58 radius ,",
    "we obtain @xmath71 luminosity in the @xmath2 kev band , which results in the @xmath72 ratio of @xmath73 .",
    "the luminous nature of the diffuse emission and the high @xmath72 ratios also indicate that the diffuse emission is dominated by hot gas and only a small fraction of this component arises from unresolved compact objects .",
    "in particular , the @xmath72 ratio of unresolved faint compact objects ( abs and cvs ) is in the range of @xmath74 in the @xmath2 kev band @xcite . on the other hand , unresolved lmxbs ( @xmath75 )",
    "are expected to contribute with an @xmath72 ratio of @xmath6@xmath76 in the @xmath2 kev band . to obtain this value",
    "we assume the average lmxb luminosity function @xcite and the average lmxb power law spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus , unresolved compact objects can account only for @xmath77 of the total x - ray emission in the large circular region and for @xmath78 within the @xmath3 ellipse .",
    "the observed @xmath72 ratios in ngc4342 are atypical of low - stellar mass galaxies ( @xmath79@xmath80 ) , but are observed in ellipticals that have @xmath6@xmath81 times more stellar mass @xcite . _",
    "although this result may be initially unexpected , it actually demonstrates that the amount of x - ray emitting gas in galaxies depends on their total gravitating mass rather than solely on their stellar mass .",
    "_ indeed , in @xcite we pointed out that ngc4342 has a massive dark matter halo , with a total gravitating mass in the range of @xmath82 within @xmath43 kpc , which is typical of galaxies with @xmath6@xmath81 times more stellar mass @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that neither the presence of nor the observed physical properties of the bright x - ray halo are unusual , given the massive dark matter halo surrounding ngc4342 .",
    "moreover , the case of ngc4342 points out that part of the scatter observed in the @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of early - type galaxies may be due to the fact that galaxies with similar stellar mass can have markedly different dark matter halo masses .",
    "the x - ray light distribution of ngc4342 shows strong hydrodynamic disturbances with a very distinct surface brightness edge at the northeastern side and a following tail at the southwestern side of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra_soft ] ) . to investigate the head - tail structure of the hot gas",

    "chandra _ image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra_soft ] ) the surface brightness abruptly drops at the northeastern side of the galaxy at about @xmath85 from the galaxy center . the decrease in surface brightness is approximately a factor of six . beyond the edge , the surface brightness is approximately constant , indicating the presence of large - scale x - ray emission outside ngc4342 . in the opposite , southwestern direction ,",
    "the surface brightness decreases continuously , but even at @xmath6@xmath86 is higher than that measured on the northeastern side of ngc4342 . to sum up",
    ", the surface brightness distribution confirms the head - tail distribution of the x - ray emitting gas , and indicates that the galaxy is surrounded by large - scale diffuse emission .    to map the temperature distribution of the hot x - ray emitting gas , we used two approaches",
    ". first , we studied the temperature distribution along the surface brightness edge and tail using wedges with the same position angles as for the profiles . for each region we extracted an x - ray spectrum and fit it using an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( apec in xspec ) with column density fixed at the galactic level and abundance fixed at @xmath52 solar @xcite",
    "the temperature distribution , shown in fig . [ fig : temperature ] , demonstrates that the x - ray emitting gas associated with ngc4342 is fairly isothermal with a temperature of @xmath1 kev . outside the galaxy , at the position of the surface brightness edge the gas temperature sharply increases to @xmath6@xmath87 kev . at the southwestern side of the galaxy beyond @xmath58 ( @xmath43 kpc in projection ) the temperature gradually rises from @xmath6@xmath88 kev to @xmath6@xmath89 kev .",
    "the low temperature of the x - ray gas in the tail suggests that it mostly originates from galaxy gas rather than from the hotter group gas . as a second approach",
    ", we produced a temperature map of ngc4342 and its neighborhood using the acis - s3 detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] ) .",
    "the temperature map , in good agreement with the temperature profile , demonstrates that the hot gas is approximately isothermal within @xmath6@xmath58  its temperature is @xmath6@xmath88 kev",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] illustrates the presence of a sharp increase in the temperature at the approximate location of the surface brightness edge .",
    "we note that the offset between the actual position of the edge and the temperature increase in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] is the consequence of the method used to construct the temperature map .",
    "= 8.5 cm    from the observed surface brightness distribution and the temperature difference inside and outside the edge , we conclude that the detected sharp surface brightness edge is a contact discontinuity or cold front .",
    "thus , the observed head - tail distribution of the hot gas is produced by ram pressure as ngc4342 moves through the external gas @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm      diffuse x - ray emission is not only associated with ngc4342 , but also extends to large scales around the galaxy . to study the external diffuse emission , we extracted its x - ray energy spectrum using three off - axis _",
    "detectors , namely acis - s2 , acis - i2 , and acis - i3 . for each detector",
    "the extraction region was a @xmath90 rectangle centered on the center of the ccd .",
    "the resulting spectra were fit with an optically - thin thermal plasma model ( apec model in xspec ) with abundance fixed at @xmath52 solar @xcite .",
    "the spectral fits are statistically acceptable , which suggests that the emission originates from hot group / cluster gas .",
    "the best - fit temperatures are in the range of @xmath91 kev and agree within statistical uncertainties . given the best - fit parameters , we also compute the average surface brightness of the external emission and found it to be fairly uniform . on each off - axis ccd",
    "the surface brightness level is between @xmath92 .",
    "the fairly uniform properties of the external gas out to @xmath6@xmath93 ( @xmath6@xmath94 kpc in projection ) distance from ngc4342 suggest that this emission has a large extent compared to the galaxy .",
    "given the proximity of ngc4365 to ngc4342 , which is presumably the center of the @xmath18 cloud , it is plausible that a large fraction of the observed external diffuse emission is associated with the @xmath18 cloud .",
    "since ngc4342 lies @xmath95 kpc in projection to the southwest from ngc4365 , the existence of the group gas around ngc4342 places a lower limit on the extent of the @xmath18 cloud .",
    "we note that according to the study of @xcite the extent of the @xmath18 cloud may be much larger than this lower limit , since two galaxies ( ngc4434 and ngc4318 ) , presumably belonging the group , lie at a projected distance of @xmath6@xmath96 ( @xmath6@xmath50 kpc in projection ) from ngc4365 .",
    "however , the presence of the underlying virgo cluster emission introduces a major caveat in exploring the properties of the group gas . at the position of ngc4342",
    ", the temperature of the virgo cluster gas may be similar or somewhat higher than @xmath97@xmath98 kev , furthermore its abundance may be also close to @xmath52 solar .",
    "therefore , the hot x - ray emitting gas , originating from the @xmath18 cloud is virtually indistinguishable from the virgo cluster emission .",
    "this effect has two major consequences : first , the best - fit parameters do not necessarily characterize the x - ray emitting gas of the @xmath18 cloud , as it could be blended with the underlying virgo emission . for this reason",
    "the physical conditions of the group gas , such as temperature , density , pressure , can not be measured precisely .",
    "second , the surface brightness profile of the emission also can not be characterized accurately , since beyond the virial radius of the virgo cluster ( @xmath99 ) the distribution of the cluster gas is largely unknown .    acknowledging these uncertainties",
    ", we provide an admittedly crude estimate on the total gravitating mass of the @xmath18 cloud within @xmath95 kpc .",
    "we assume that the group gas is isothermal and has a temperature of @xmath100 kev , furthermore we assume that the x - ray gas has a spherically symmetric distribution . using these assumptions we estimate that the total gravitating mass within @xmath95 kpc is @xmath6@xmath101 .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath18 cloud is most likely significantly larger than @xmath95 kpc , therefore this mass estimate should be considered as a lower limit . to explore the spatial distribution and better",
    "understand the physical properties of the x - ray gas associated with the @xmath18 cloud further x - ray observations would be highly beneficial .",
    "the detection of a cold front and the presence of large - scale diffuse emission implies that ngc4342 moves with high velocity through an ambient medium towards the northeast , i.e. towards ngc4365 .",
    "the velocity of ngc4342 can be estimated using the ratio of the thermal pressures at the stagnation point ( @xmath102 ) and in the free stream ( @xmath103 ) @xcite .",
    "however , several uncertainties are involved in this calculation .",
    "first , the path length of the external gas is rather uncertain . according to @xcite",
    "the @xmath18 cloud may extend out to @xmath6@xmath50 kpc ( sect .",
    "[ sec : groupgas ] ) , which is typical for a poor galaxy group .",
    "second , the thermal pressures are measured in relatively large regions hence we assume that no pressure gradients are present .",
    "while this may be a good assumption outside the edge , it somewhat overestimates the pressure inside the edge .",
    "therefore the @xmath104 ratio hence the velocity of ngc4342 will be slightly overestimated . finally , due to the underlying virgo emission ( for discussion see sect .",
    "[ sec : groupgas ] ) the properties of the grup gas of the @xmath18 cloud can not be determined with certainty .",
    "therefore , if a significant fraction of the external gas originates from the virgo cluster , the estimated density and hence the pressure of the group gas becomes lower , resulting in a larger @xmath104 ratio and a larger velocity for ngc4342 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to compute the pressure ratios , we extract spectra of two circular wedges centered on ngc4342 with radii of @xmath105 and @xmath106 and position angle of @xmath107 .",
    "note that the surface brightness edge is located at @xmath85 from the galaxy center . for the region inside the edge ,",
    "we assume spherical symmetry , whereas outside the edge we assume a path length of @xmath50 kpc . the spectra were fit with thermal plasma models as described in section [ sec : edge ] .",
    "the best - fit temperatures inside and outside the edge are @xmath108 kev and @xmath109 kev . from the emission measure",
    ", we compute the number densities inside and outside the edge and obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the average pressure can be computed as @xmath112 , hence we obtain @xmath113 and @xmath114 , implying a pressure ratio @xmath115 .",
    "this pressure ratio corresponds to a mach - number of @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we stress that the given uncertainties correspond to the statistical uncertainties in the determination of the pressures , and do not represent the above discussed systematic uncertainties . the sound speed in a @xmath117 kev plasma",
    "is @xmath118 assuming @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , ngc4342 is falling towards ngc4365 with a velocity of @xmath121 .",
    "based on the radial velocities of ngc4342 and ngc4365 , and on the supersonic ( @xmath6@xmath122 ) infall velocity of the former galaxy , we determine the orientation of the motion of ngc4342 .",

    "thus , the combination of these two components is in good agreement with the observed @xmath72 ratios .",
    "hence the bulk of the @xmath141 kev band diffuse emission originates from the population of unresolved lmxbs and unresolved faint compact objects , mainly abs and cvs .",
    "within the @xmath3 ellipse of ngc4342 , we detect 8 bright point sources . in table [ tab : sources ] we list the position , the number of total and background counts within the source cells , and the luminosity of the sources in the @xmath40 kev energy band . to estimate the background level at the source locations we used surrounding annuli or nearby circular apertures if another source was lying too close .",
    "the most luminous source is coincident with the center of ngc4342 . to study its nature",
    "we extracted its x - ray energy spectrum and fit it with a power law model with the column density fixed at the galactic value .",
    "the resulting fit is acceptable , the best - fit slope of the power law model is @xmath147 .",
    "according to the best - fit model , the luminosity of this source is @xmath148 .",
    "based on the position of the nuclear source , we conclude that it is associated with the supermassive black hole of ngc4342 .",

    "the resulting acceptable fit yields a power law slope of @xmath149 . although not conclusive , the best - fit model is consistent with the typical lmxb spectrum @xcite . to estimate the number of cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) sources within the @xmath3 ellipse , we rely on the @xmath150 distribution of @xcite . to convert the @xmath151 kev band @xmath150 distribution of cxb sources to the @xmath40 kev energy range , we assumed a power law model with a slope of @xmath152 .",
    "additonally , we also corrected for incompleteness effects using the procedure described in @xcite . within the @xmath3 ellipse ,",
    "the cxb source density is @xmath28@xmath153 , hence we expect @xmath28@xmath154 cxb sources . we thus conclude that majority ( @xmath6@xmath155 ) of the non - central resolved sources are lmxbs .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm      outside the @xmath3 ellipse we resolved a large number of point sources . to study the spatial distribution of the detected sources , we divided the surroundings of ngc4342 into three circular annuli centered on the center of the galaxy .",
    "the outer radii of the annuli were @xmath58 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : source_excess ] left panel ) .",
    "note , that sources within the @xmath3 ellipse were excluded . in each annulus",
    "we compute the source density and compare it with the expected cxb source density , which was computed based on the @xmath150 distribution of @xcite .",
    "as before we assumed a power law model with slope of @xmath152 to convert the @xmath151 kev band @xmath150 distribution to the @xmath40 kev energy range , and we applied incompleteness correction following the method of @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : source_excess ] shows that within @xmath156 ( @xmath6@xmath158 kpc in projection ) of the center of ngc4342 the observed source density significantly exceeds the expected cxb source density .",
    "in particular , within @xmath156 we resolve @xmath159 sources , whereas the predicted number of background sources is @xmath28@xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath28@xmath161 excess sources correspond to a @xmath6@xmath162 excess . beyond a radius of @xmath156 the numbers of detected and expected sources are in good agreement .",
    "since the cxb level fluctuates only at the @xmath163 level , it is very likely that the excess sources are associated with ngc4342 .    in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that ngc4342 resides in a massive dark matter halo , which extends out to at least @xmath164 kpc and possibly much farther .",
    "thus , if the excess x - ray sources are associated with ngc4342 , they are located in its dark matter halo , outside the optical extent of the galaxy . in this interpretation , it is feasible that these sources are lmxbs located in globular clusters ( gc - lmxbs ) .",
    "studies of gc - lmxbs in nearby galaxies pointed out that only a few per cent of gcs host lmxbs brighter than @xmath165 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that @xmath166 of blue ( metal - poor ) gcs host lmxbs brighter than @xmath6@xmath48 , furthermore attributing the @xmath6@xmath7 excess sources to gc - lmxbs , we estimate that ngc4342 may host @xmath167 gcs .",
    "the possibly large gc population is further supported by the rather tight correlation between the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( @xmath168 ) and the number of gcs in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "given the best - fit @xmath169 relation @xcite and the black hole mass @xcite of ngc4342 ( @xmath170  converted to a distance of @xmath171 mpc ) the predicted number of gcs is @xmath172 , in good agreement with that predicted from the number of excess x - ray sources .",
    "the presence of a notable gc population around ngc4342 can be confirmed by deep optical observations . to probe the gc systems around ngc4342 , we rely on the publicly available canada france hawaii telescope / megacam ( cfht / megacam ) imaging and data products ( blom et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the region of ngc4342 is covered with the @xmath173 filter image stack ( total 4240 s of exposure and @xmath174 spatial resolution ) and the @xmath175 and @xmath176 filter stacks ( total 3170/2055 s of exposure and @xmath177 spatial resolution ) , which allow the identification of gcs using their locus in @xmath178 versus @xmath179 colour space .",
    "we define this locus with objects also in the ngc4365 gc catalogue derived from subaru / suprimecam ( scam ) imaging @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of detected gc candidates recover the concentration of gcs around ngc4365 and also demonstrates an overdensity of gcs centred on ngc4342 . to give a crude estimate on the number of gc candidates associated with ngc4342",
    ", we compare the number of observed gc candidates observed by the cfht / megacam imaging around ngc4365 and ngc4342 , and use the lower limit on the number of gcs in ngc4365 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that ngc4342 may host @xmath180 gcs .",

    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the connection between the gc population and the resolved lmxbs is beyond the scope of the present work and will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we emphasize that the estimated number of gcs associated with ngc4342 exceeds by about an order of magnitude the expected value , based on the optical luminosity of ngc4342 . to further illustrate this point",
    ", we compute the gc specific frequency using @xcite and the absolute v - band magnitude of ngc4342 ( @xmath181 mag ) .",
    "we obtain a gc specific frequency of @xmath11 , which is one of the largest values reported for full - size galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the color distribution of gcs is bimodal : blue metal - poor and red metal - rich sub - populations exist ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "whereas the distribution of the metal - rich population follows the stellar light , the metal - poor population has a broader distribution @xcite and traces dark matter halos .",
    "thus , the gc population of ngc4342 is likely to be dominated by metal - poor gcs .",
    "if optical studies confirm the presence of a notable metal - poor gc population , their formation mechanism can be constrained .",
    "specifically , the presence of a large metal - poor gc population in ngc4342  a galaxy with very low stellar mass but a massive dark matter halo  would promote an evolutionary scenario , in which metal - poor gcs are formed prior to the main stellar body of the galaxy .",
    "this would be consistent with the formation scenario described by @xcite , who  based on a semianalytic galaxy formation model @xcite  suggested that metal - poor gcs are formed at high redshift ( @xmath182 ) in gas disks in low - mass dark - matter halos before the major burst of star - formation .",
    "we studied the diffuse x - ray emission and the population of resolved sources in ngc4342 using _ chandra _ x - ray observations .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : + 1 .",
    "ngc4342 hosts a bright x - ray halo originating from hot gas with a temperature of @xmath1 kev .",
    "the distribution of the hot gas is significantly broader than that of the stellar light . within the @xmath3 ellipse ,",
    "the @xmath2 kev band luminosity of the diffuse emission is @xmath69 , which yields an @xmath72 ratio of @xmath70 .",
    "we detect a sharp surface brightness edge at the northeastern side of ngc4342 , which we identify as a contact discontinuity or cold front . from the thermal pressure ratios between inside and outside the edge ,",
    "we estimate that ngc4342 is moving supersonically ( @xmath5 or @xmath6@xmath122 ) towards the northeast , i.e. towards ngc4365 .    \\3 . within the @xmath3 ellipse",
    "we resolve 8 point sources .",
    "the brightest source has a luminosity of @xmath148 and is located at the center of ngc4342 .",
    "hence we conclude that this source is associated with the supermassive black hole of ngc4342 .    \\4 . outside the @xmath3 ellipse",
    "we detect 2@xmath15 bright x - ray sources , @xmath6@xmath7 more than expected from the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "the excess sources may be lmxbs located in metal - poor gcs , which systems are associated with the massive dark matter halo of ngc4342 . since only a few per cent of gcs host lmxbs brighter than @xmath165 , we estimate that ngc4342 could host @xmath6@xmath9 gcs .",
