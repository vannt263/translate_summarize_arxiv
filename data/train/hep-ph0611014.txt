    "many of the extensions of the standard model that are testable at the lhc have been motivated by the hierarchy puzzle .",
    "however , the small value of the cosmological constant requires a fine tuning that in many ways is quite similar to the fine tuning needed to keep the higgs scalar light .",
    "most extensions of the standard model that are constructed to solve the hierarchy puzzle still require a fine tuning to keep the cosmological constant small .",
    "it is possible that we are not looking at this issue correctly and that stability of radiatively corrected scalar potential should not be the motivation for extensions of the standard model .",
    "the scalar sector of the standard model has not been tested directly by experiment , so it is certainly worth examining models with simple extensions of this sector and exploring their phenomenology in some detail .",
    "there does not seem to be a compelling motivation for a scalar sector that consists of just a single higgs doublet .",
    "however , if one does not adopt additional symmetry principles  @xcite then adding more doublets typically gives unacceptably large tree level flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "furthermore scalar fields with nontrivial @xmath0 quantum numbers that are different from those of the standard model higgs doublet must have small vacuum expectation values to preserve the standard model value of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the phenomenology of the standard model higgs scalar , models with multiple higgs doublets , and of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model has been studied extensively , and ref .",
    "@xcite contains some excellent reviews .",
    "the simplest extension of the scalar sector of the minimal standard model is to add a single real scalar @xmath2 that is a gauge singlet .",
    "this does not have to be a fundamental degree of freedom ; the higgs doublet and this scalar might be the only light remnants of a more complicated scalar sector that manifests itself at scales that are too high to be directly probed by the next generation of accelerator experiments . in this paper",
    "we examine the phenomenology of this extension of the standard model .",
    "extensions of the minimal standard model with one or more singlets @xmath2 have been studied before in the literature .",
    "many of the models impose a @xmath3 symmetry , so that the singlet can be a dark matter candidate .",
    "other works ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) either do not impose a @xmath3 symmetry or break that symmetry , but have some differences with the model we present here ( e.g. , some possible couplings in the scalar potential are missing , or the lighter scalar is taken to be massless , etc . ) in any case , it seems worth reexamining the phenomenology of this model since we are approaching the lhc era .",
    "our work was inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite where an additional scalar superfield was added to the minimal supersymmetric standard model to solve the @xmath4 problem , and some of our conclusions are similar to theirs .    in the minimal standard model",
    "the scalar potential for the higgs doublet @xmath5 contains only two parameters which can be eliminated in favor of the higgs particle mass and the vacuum expectation value that breaks @xmath0 gauge symmetry . when the singlet scalar @xmath2 is added the number of parameters of the scalar potential swells to seven .",
    "however for most of the phenomenology only a few parameters are relevant , and a very simple picture emerges . the singlet scalar @xmath2 and the higgs scalar @xmath6 mix , and both of the resulting physical particles have couplings to quarks , leptons and to gauge bosons that are proportional to those of the standard model higgs particle .",
    "in addition to decays to the standard model fermions and gauge bosons , the heavier of these two scalar particles may decay to a pair of the lighter ones .",
    "in this brief report we focus on the region of parameter space where the lighter of the two scalar particles is mostly singlet and has a small enough mass so that it can be pair produced in decays of the heavier ( mostly ) higgs scalar",
    ". this will be the most interesting case for lhc physics .",
    "the only new parameters ( beyond those in the standard model ) that are needed to characterize most of the phenomenology of this model are the @xmath7 mixing angle , the mass of the new light scalar particle , and the branching ratio for the decay of the heavier higgs scalar to a pair of the lighter ones .",
    "the lagrange density for the scalar sector of this model is @xmath8 where @xmath5 denotes the complex higgs doublet and @xmath2 the real scalar . without loss of generality , we shift the field @xmath2 so it has no vacuum expectation value",
    ". then the potential is given by @xmath9 note that there is no additional @xmath10 violation that comes from the scalar potential .",
    "in unitary gauge the charged component of the higgs doublet @xmath5 becomes the longitudinal components of the charged @xmath11-bosons and the imaginary part of the neutral component becomes the longitudinal component of the @xmath12-boson .",
    "the neutral component is written as @xmath13 the mass terms in the scalar potential become @xmath14 where @xmath15 the mass eigenstate fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linear combinations of the higgs scalar field @xmath6 and the singlet scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "explicitly , for the lighter field @xmath18 @xmath19 where  @xcite @xmath20 the terms in the scalar potential that break the discrete @xmath21 symmetry are proportional to the couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 so it is natural for those scalar couplings to be small .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 controls the mixing of the two scalar states .",
    "as we will see , experimental constraints force the mixing angle @xmath24 to be small .",
    "we assume the heavier state is mostly the higgs scalar so @xmath25 .",
    "the masses of the two scalars are @xmath26",
    "the lighter scalar state decays to standard model particles and its couplings to them are proportional to the standard model higgs couplings with constant of proportionality @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , the lighter of the two states has branching ratios equal to those of the standard model higgs ( if it had mass @xmath28 ) and its production rates are @xmath29 times the production rates for a standard model higgs ( if it had mass @xmath28 ) . since @xmath30 can be much smaller than unity , @xmath28 can be much smaller than the mass of the standard model higgs , which is restricted by the lep bound to be heavier than @xmath31 .    if @xmath32 then the heavier state has branching ratios to standard model particles and production rates approximately equal to those of the standard model higgs scalar ( recall we are working in the limit of small mixing ) . however",
    "if @xmath33 then the decay channel @xmath34 is available with partial decay width @xmath35 for a @xmath16 that has mass below @xmath36 its dominant decay mode to standard model particles is to a bottom anti - bottom pair and so in this mass range @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the decay width of the standard model higgs .",
    "conventional branching ratios of the heavier scalar @xmath16 are reduced from those of the standard model higgs by a factor @xmath39 which is equal to @xmath40      if @xmath28 is much smaller than the weak scale it seems most natural to take @xmath41 to be of order @xmath42 or smaller , since if it is much larger than this a strong cancellation between the two terms contributing to @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) is necessary .",
    "suppose @xmath28 is less than the @xmath44-quark mass , @xmath45 .",
    "with @xmath46 we find that in this region of parameter space @xmath39 is very close to unity since @xmath47 .",
    "the heavier scalar state will behave much like the standard model higgs particle .",
    "the properties of a very light @xmath17 are severely constrained by present experimental data .",
    "consider , for example , the case where @xmath48 .",
    "then the branching ratio of the @xmath16 to two @xmath17 s is very small and the @xmath16 is indistinguishable from the standard model higgs particle .",
    "the dominant decay modes of the @xmath17 are to two pions and to @xmath49 with partial decay rates one can expect sizeable corrections from , for example , @xmath50 final state interactions .",
    "these are expected to increase the decay rate to two pions .",

    "the strongest constraint on the mixing angle @xmath24 comes from the decay @xmath55 which has branching ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the experimental limit @xmath57  @xcite implies that @xmath58 .",
    "hence the lifetime of the @xmath17 is at least @xmath59 ( i.e. , about the @xmath60 meson lifetime ) .",
    "the @xmath17 can be produced directly in @xmath12 decays .",
    "single @xmath17 production is suppressed by the the small mixing angle , @xmath61 , where @xmath39 denotes any of the light standard model fermions .",
    "the @xmath17 can also be pair - produced through a virtual @xmath16 , with a rate that is not suppressed by the small mixing angle @xmath24 , via the process @xmath62 .",
    "we find that this rate is negligible , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we find that @xmath65 .",
    "the rate is even smaller for smaller values of @xmath28 . ]",
    "when @xmath66 .",
    "this mass range is interesting because the decays of the heavier scalar , which is mostly the standard model higgs , can be quite different from what the minimal standard model predicts . in this mass range",
    "the @xmath17 is light enough that the decay @xmath68 is kinematically allowed .",
    "in addition the @xmath17 is heavy enough so that values of @xmath69 that give this decay a significant branching ratio do not require a delicate cancellation between the two terms contributing to @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) . at the lower end of this mass range",
    "we would not expect the dominant decay of the @xmath16 to be to two @xmath17 s ; however , with no awkward cancellation between the two terms contributing to @xmath43 , the @xmath16 could easily decay about the same amount of time to two @xmath17 s as it does to two photons . at the upper end of the mass range",
    "it is quite reasonable to have the @xmath16 decaying mostly to two @xmath17 s .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : suppression ] we plot the suppression factor @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the standard model branching fraction , assuming that the parameter @xmath72 and that the mixing angle @xmath24 is very small .",
    "notice that as one approaches the upper range of the mass range we are considering , decays of the @xmath16 can be dominated by the final state @xmath73 , and consequently the branching ratio to the the two photon mode is suppressed compared to what it is in the standard model .",
    "the dependence of @xmath39 on the mass of the @xmath17 arises because the same coupling in the lagrangian that gives rise to this branching ratio also contributes to the @xmath17 mass .",
    "if @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 , then @xmath39 will be close to unity throughout the whole range we consider .     discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     scalar particle.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since the @xmath16 may decay dominantly to a pair of the lighter @xmath17 scalars it is useful to understand the ensuing @xmath17 decays .",
    "we plot the branching ratios of the @xmath17 in fig .  [",
    "fig : br ] . in the upper end of the mass range we are considering",
    ", the @xmath17 decays mostly to a bottom - antibottom pair but it also has substantial branching fractions to @xmath76 and to @xmath77 .",
    "considerable attention has been given to a different class of models where the the heavier higgs scalar decays mostly to a singlet scalar that consequently decays to neutrinos  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that new physics at the @xmath78 scale can easily give rise to a large reduction ( or enhancement ) in the dominant gluon fusion higgs scalar production rate , and hence the final two photon signal .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that such physics could alter the associated production rate of the higgs since it arises from the tree coupling to the massive weak bosons . the situation is different here .",
    "all the standard model decays of the heavier higgs - like scalar @xmath16 are reduced by the same factor @xmath39 independent of its production mechanism .",
    "the production of @xmath17 scalars from gluon fusion is suppressed from the production rate for a standard model higgs of the same mass by @xmath79 . since the @xmath17 was not observed at @xmath80 there is a mass dependent limit on @xmath81 from @xmath80 data  @xcite ( very roughly , @xmath82 over the mass range we are considering . ) .",
    "however , the @xmath17 production rate via gluon fusion at the tevatron and lhc increases rapidly as its mass decreases . for example , using leading order cteq5 parton distributions  @xcite an @xmath17 of mass @xmath83 has a production rate roughly @xmath84 times greater than one with a mass of @xmath85 at the lhc and @xmath86 times greater at the tevatron .",
    "even with a small value for @xmath79 the @xmath17 may be directly observable at the lhc .",
    "the literature on extensions of the minimal standard model with a more complicated scalar sector is vast . here",
    ", we have considered the simplest alternative possibility , in which a single gauge - singlet scalar is added .",
    "it mixes with , and couples to , the standard model higgs .",
    "we concentrate on the region of allowed singlet scalar masses where it is light enough to be pair produced in higgs decay and , hence , suppress the higgs golden mode \" branching ratio to two photons .",
    "we found that this suppression is unlikely to be significant if the new scalar is very light but can easily be large if the ( mostly ) singlet scalar is heavier than about @xmath83 . under this scenario , there is a scalar that has a mass below the lep higgs mass lower bound with decay branching ratios that are identical to those of a standard model higgs of the same mass .",
    "however its production rate is suppressed by a small mixing angle .",
    "potential signatures of such light scalars include the observation of higgs decay products with invariant mass well below 114 gev or unusual final states in higgs decay such as two @xmath44-jets and a @xmath77 ( or @xmath49 ) pair .      s.  l.  glashow and s.  weinberg , phys .",
