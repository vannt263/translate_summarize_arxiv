    "qcd thermodynamics has been extensively studied using numerical simulations with staggered or wilson fermions .",
    "however , both formulations break the chiral symmetry of the theory .",
    "the symmetry is recovered together with the lorentz symmetry as the continuum limit is approached . in the past few years",
    "a novel fermion regulator was developed that provides a way of controlling the amount of chiral symmetry breaking at any lattice spacing .",
    "domain wall fermions @xcite utilize an extra space  time dimension with free boundary conditions to separate the two chiral components of the dirac spinor .",
    "the components are localized on the opposite boundaries ( walls ) .",
    "if the extent of the fifth `` dimension '' , @xmath2 , is infinite the two chiral components decouple and the theory has the full chiral symmetry , even at finite lattice spacing . for practical numerical simulations , @xmath2 must be finite and as a result there is a small mixing of the chiral components resulting in a residual mass .",
    "the important point is that the size of this residual chiral symmetry breaking can be controlled at any lattice spacing by increasing @xmath2 .",
    "for the first time the approach to the chiral limit has been separated from the approach to the continuum limit .    in free field theory",
    "the localization is exponential and the effective quark mass is given by @xcite : @xmath3 .\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the domain wall `` height '' and @xmath5 an explicit fermion mass . in the interacting theory",
    "there is numerical non - perturbative evidence that the general features of eq .",
    "[ eq : free_m_eff ] still hold with @xmath6 being renormalized @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ".    another unique property of domain wall fermions is that the @xmath7 limit can be studied using the overlap formalism @xcite . in that limit",
    "it can be shown that for topological gauge field backgrounds there are exact fermionic zero modes .",
    "it has been demonstrated that for masses in the range of interest the effects of finite @xmath2 on the zero modes can be made arbitrarily small for classical @xcite , @xcite and for quantum @xcite , @xcite gauge field backgrounds .",
    "domain wall fermions possess the key ingredient in reproducing anomalous effects .    for more details on domain wall fermions",
    "see the review @xcite and references within .",
    "dynamical domain wall simulations have been done in the past for the schwinger model in the @xmath7 limit ( overlap formalism ) @xcite and for finite @xmath2 @xcite using standard hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) techniques . in this work we simulated qcd using standard hmc at finite @xmath2 .",
    "the gauge fields are defined on the four - dimensional lattice while the fermion fields on the five - dimensional one .",
    "the five - dimensional dirac operator is as in @xcite with even - odd preconditioning .",
    "the bulk effects of the @xmath2 heavy flavors were subtracted @xcite by introducing five - dimensional bosonic fields as in @xcite .",
    "we used the @xmath8 algorithm with trajectory length of @xmath9 and step sizes @xmath10 resulting in acceptance rates @xmath11 . the standard conjugate gradient inversion algorithm ( cg )",
    "was used with a typical number of cg iterations ranging from @xmath12 .",
    "we used initial configurations in the opposite phase and @xmath13 thermalization sweeps .",
    "the computational cost is linear in @xmath2 .",
    "in order to investigate the feasibility of studying qcd thermodynamics with domain wall fermions , to locate the critical coupling , and to investigate the parameter space of this new regulator ( @xmath14 ) we performed a large number of simulations at various couplings on @xmath15 and @xmath16 lattices using the _ qcdsp _ machine .",
    "this was possible due to the robustness of the machine and software that allowed us to split a 200 gflops portion of it to 7 independent , 6 gflops machines and 6 independent , 25 gflops machines .",
    "a sharp change on the value of the chiral condensate @xmath17 and the magnitude of the wilson line @xmath18 was observed as @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 being the gauge coupling constant ) was varied .",
    "this can be seen in figure 1 for an @xmath21 lattice with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the fits are to @xmath25)]$ ] . in the broken phase we did a dynamical mass extrapolation of @xmath17 at @xmath26 with @xmath27 and found a non zero intercept , @xmath28 , indicating the expected spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . in the symmetric phase a dynamical mass extrapolation of @xmath17 at @xmath29 with @xmath30 resulted in an intercept of @xmath31 but",
    "when @xmath2 was increased to @xmath27 the intercept dropped to @xmath32 indicating that the full chiral symmetry was restored to a high degree .",
    "similar results were obtained on a @xmath33 lattice at @xmath29 , @xmath22 and @xmath27 , resulting in an intercept of @xmath34 .",
    "the dynamical mass data and extrapolations are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of our results is presented in figure 3 .",
    "the lines are curves of the form @xmath35 that go through the three points .",
    "the horizontal lines are the @xmath36 lines .",
    "as can be seen in the broken phase ( @xmath26 ) where the coupling is larger , the decay rate @xmath37 is larger than the one in the symmetric phase ( @xmath29 ) as expected from the schwinger model @xcite . at @xmath27 and @xmath26 @xmath17",
    "is within @xmath38 of the extrapolated value while at @xmath29 it agrees within the error bars .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 is more subtle . in free field theory @xmath39",
    "corresponds to no light flavors , @xmath4 to one and @xmath40 to four light flavors .",
    "also , for positive but small @xmath6 the number of low momentum states becomes small ( for more details and numerical results see @xcite ) . in order to study these effects",
    "we located @xmath41 using @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for various values of @xmath6 on @xmath15 lattices .",
    "the results are in figure 4",
    ". the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath6 can be viewed as an expected renormalization effect .",
    "due to the exceptional zero mode properties of domain wall fermions the possibly anomalous breaking of the @xmath43 symmetry just above the transition can be investigated with clarity and without subtleties such as zero mode shift effects ( staggered fermions ) or proximity to the aoki phase ( wilson fermions ) .",
    "we measured the difference of the screening masses of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath5 on a @xmath46 lattice at @xmath29 with @xmath22 and @xmath27 .",
    "the data fits to @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the small @xmath50 and the near - zero , small - mass limit of @xmath17 indicate that the chiral symmetry breaking effects due to the fermion regulator ( @xmath51 ) are negligible so that this preliminary , non - zero @xmath52 value suggests that @xmath43 remains broken just above the transition .",
    "we presented results from numerical simulations of full , two flavor qcd thermodynamics at @xmath0 with domain wall fermions .",
    "they indicate the presence of a low temperature phase with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking but intact flavor symmetry and a high temperature phase with the full @xmath1 chiral flavor symmetry . given this ,",
    "we interpret the difference seen in the @xmath45 and @xmath44 screening lengths just above the transition as preliminary evidence for the anomalous breaking of the @xmath43 symmetry ."
