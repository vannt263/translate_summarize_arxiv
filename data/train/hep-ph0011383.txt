    "the standard feature of applications of perturbative qcd to hard processes is the introduction of phenomenological functions accumulating information about nonperturbative long - distance dynamics .",

    "the cases of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and hard exclusive electroproduction processes @xcite involve nonforward matrix elements @xmath4 .",
    "the important feature ( noticed long ago @xcite ) is that kinematics of hard elastic electroproduction processes ( dvcs can be also treated as one of them ) requires the presence of the longitudinal component in the momentum transfer @xmath5 from the initial hadron to the final : @xmath6 . for dvcs and @xmath7-electroproduction in the region @xmath8 ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum asymmetry ( or `` skewedness '' ) parameter @xmath9 coincides with the bjorken variable @xmath10 associated with the virtual photon momentum @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this means that the nonperturbative matrix element @xmath4 is nonsymmetric ( skewed ) , and the distributions which appear in the hard elastic electroproduction amplitudes differ from those studied in inclusive processes . in the latter case ,",
    "one has a symmetric situation when the same momentum @xmath12 appears in both brackets of the hadronic matrix element @xmath13 .",
    "to parametrize nonforward matrix elements @xmath14 of quark and gluon light - cone operators one can use two basic types of nonperturbative functions .",

    "the other possibility is to treat the proportionality coefficient @xmath9 as an independent parameter and introduce an alternative description in terms of the nonforward parton distributions ( nfpds ) @xmath1 with @xmath18 being the total fraction of the initial hadron momentum taken by the initial parton .",
    "the shape of nfpds explicitly depends on the parameter @xmath9 characterizing the _ skewedness _ of the relevant nonforward matrix element .",
    "this parametrization of nonforward matrix elements by @xmath1 is similar to that proposed by x. ji @xcite who introduced off - forward parton distributions ( ofpds ) @xmath19 in which the parton momenta and the skewedness parameter @xmath20 are measured in units of the average hadron momentum @xmath21 .",
    "ofpds and nfpds @xcite can be treated as particular forms of _ skewed _ parton distributions ( spds ) .",

    "a detailed analysis of pqcd factorization for hard meson electroproduction processes was given in ref .",
    "our goal in the present lectures is to give a description of the approach outlined in our papers @xcite .",
    "in the pqcd factorization treatment of hard electroproduction processes , the nonperturbative information is accumulated in the nonforward matrix elements @xmath24 of light cone operators @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 the matrix elements depend on the relative coordinate @xmath27 through two lorentz invariant variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the forward case , when @xmath30 , one obtains the usual quark helicity - averaged densities by fourier transforming the relevant matrix element with respect to @xmath28 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the gauge link , @xmath33 are the dirac spinors and we use the notation @xmath34 .",

    "<S> applications of perturbative qcd to deeply virtual compton scattering and hard exclusive electroproduction processes require a generalization of usual parton distributions for the case when long - distance information is accumulated in nonforward matrix elements of quark and gluon light - cone operators . </S>",
    "<S> we describe two types of nonperturbative functions parametrizing such matrix elements : double distributions @xmath0 and skewed distribution functions @xmath1 , discuss their properties , and basic uses in the qcd description of hard exclusive processes . </S>"
