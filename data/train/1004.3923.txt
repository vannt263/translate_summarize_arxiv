    "molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide are the most abundant molecular species in the majority of interstellar environments , and they play important roles in determining the physics and chemistry of diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "co is observed in diffuse clouds in absorption in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and visible and in emission at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths @xcite , revealing the physical and chemical complexity along these lines of sight . as an example , @xcite recently investigated the formation , fractionation , and rotational excitation of co in h@xmath0 bearing diffuse h i clouds . due to its small rotational constant ,",
    "co can be easily rotationally excited by collisions with other species in interstellar gas , mostly h@xmath0 , with co rotational lines providing important diagnostics of gas density and temperature .",
    "the abundance ratio , co / h@xmath0 , is assumed to be roughly constant in dense molecular gas , as such , co is often used as a tracer of h@xmath0 , as the latter is difficult to detect in emission in cold environments .",
    "the observed co abundance is therefore used to estimate the total h@xmath0 content @xcite .    in environments with an intense uv field ,",
    "the radiation can drive the chemistry and internal level populations out of equilibrium . in such situations , a photodissociation region ( pdr )",
    "resides at the interface of the hot h ii region and the cold molecular region . in recent years",
    "various codes which model the physics and chemistry of pdrs have been developed with an emphasis on the excitation mechanisms of both h@xmath0 and co @xcite .    in more dense environments such as low - mass dwarf stars ( i.e. , m , l , or t dwarfs ) , co is an important opacity source and its infrared line list can be obtained quite accurately @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed in the dayside spectrum of the transiting hot - jupiter extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) hd 189733b @xcite . while molecular level populations are typically treated in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in stellar and planetary atmospheres ,",
    "@xcite have pointed out that non - lte conditions may exist in very cool stellar atmospheres or in cases where the temperature of the incident radiation , i.e. close - in egps , is much different from the kinetic temperature of the gas .    due to the astrophysical importance of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide ,",
    "the co - h@xmath0 collisional system has been the subject of numerous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",
    "quantitative determinations of state - to - state cross sections and rate coefficients for co - h@xmath0 collisions are crucial to numerical models of various astrophysical environments , such as those highlighted above .",
    "however , as measurements of these quantities are difficult , numerical models often rely on cross sections and rate coefficients derived from theoretical methods . in a highly - cited work , @xcite performed close - coupling calculations of rate coefficients based on an approximate co - h@xmath0 potential surface .",
    "since then , a number of quantum scattering calculations were carried out on various potential energy surfaces ( pess ) . in this work",
    ", we have performed comprehensive calculations of state - to - state cross sections in an effort to develop a complete database of rotational quenching rate coefficients , but utilizing a more recent , and presumably more accurate pes . in the following sections , the choice of the potential surface , the adopted scattering approach , and the results are discussed .",
    "we briefly highlight important astrophysical applications of the current co - h@xmath0 rate coefficients for modeling of far ir ( fir ) observations .",
    "a number of pess @xcite have been developed for the co - h@xmath0 complex .",
    "one of the most accurate surfaces was given by @xcite who calculated a four - dimensional , rigid - rotor pes referred to as v@xmath5 .",
    "this surface was constructed using the symmetry - adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) method with high - level electron correlation effects .",
    "an analytical fit of the _ ab initio _ pes has a global minimum of 109.3 @xmath6 at the intermolecular separation of 7.76  a@xmath7 for the linear geometry with the c atom pointing toward h@xmath0 . @xcite adopted v@xmath5 in their calculations of state - to - state cross sections for co rotational excitation at collision energies between 795 and 991 @xmath6 which were found to be in good agreement with their measurements .",
    "the v@xmath5 pes was also utilized in second virial coefficient calculations for mixtures of hydrogen and co @xcite .",
    "a comparison with experimental data suggested that the van der waals well of the v@xmath5 pes is too deep by 4%-9% , though it represents an improvement over earlier surfaces .",
    "the v@xmath5 surface has also been used in full coupled - channel cross section and rate coefficient calculations for rotationally inelastic scattering of co by para- and ortho - h@xmath0 @xcite . however , because the attractive well of v@xmath5 was presumed to be too deep , @xcite modified the pes by merely multiplying the surface by a constant factor of 0.93 which was subsequently used in their scattering calculations .",
    "a newer co - h@xmath0 pes was reported by @xcite , referred to as v@xmath8 . to improve the surface accuracy , they adopted the coupled - cluster method with single , double , and noniterative triple excitations [ ccsd(t ) ] and the supermolecular approach .",
    "the v@xmath8 surface was obtained on a five - dimensional grid including the dependence on the h - h separation , but with the co molecule taken to be rigid with the c - o separation set to the value of the c - o distance averaged over the co ground state vibrational wave function .",
    "the pes was then obtained by averaging over the intramolecular vibration of h@xmath0 to yield a four - dimensional rigid - rotor surface .",
    "similar to v@xmath5 , an analytical fit of the v@xmath8 was presented which has a global minimum of 93.05 @xmath6 , or 16.22 @xmath6 shallower than @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite used v@xmath8 to calculate the rovibrational energy levels for the para- and ortho - h@xmath0-co complex as well as the second virial coefficient .",
    "the rovibrational energies were found to agree with the experimental values of @xcite for para - h@xmath0 to within 0.1 @xmath6 while a scaling of v@xmath8 , resulting in a deepening of the well depth by 4 @xmath6 , was needed to match the measured second virial coefficients .",
    "v@xmath8 may be too shallow though it is possible that the experimental second virial coefficients are systematically too low @xcite .",
    "comparative studies of collisional cross sections using the two surfaces have been presented in our earlier work @xcite and by @xcite . in @xcite , calculations with the v@xmath8 surface gave cross sections in excellent agreement with the state - to - state measurements of @xcite .",
    "the theory for the scattering of two linear rigid rotors has been developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here were performed for collision energies between 10@xmath10 and 10,000 @xmath6 by applying both the close - coupling ( cc ) method and the coupled - states ( cs ) approximation .",
    "all the cc and cs calculations were performed using the nonreactive scattering code molscat @xcite . in the quantum scattering calculations ,",
    "the coupled - channel equations were integrated using the modified log - derivative airy propagator of @xcite with a variable step size .",
    "the largest legendre terms adopted in the potential expansion for h@xmath0 and co were , respectively , 8 and 10 .",
    "the numbers of gauss integration points used in projecting angular components of the potential were 10 , 11 , and 12 for integration in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the propagation was carried out to a maximum intermolecular separation of @xmath14  . at each energy , a sufficient number of total angular momentum partial waves was included to ensure convergence of the state - to - state cross sections to within 1% .",
    "the maximum value of the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath15 employed in the calculations was 300 . since , the computation time for cc calculations scales as @xmath16 , the cs method is adopted for energies greater than 800 @xmath6 which results in considerable time savings with a scaling proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the maximum size of the rotational basis .",
    "further details about the scattering calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the adopted rotational constants for h@xmath0 and co are 60.853 @xmath6 @xcite and 1.9225 @xmath6 @xcite , respectively .",
    "hereafter , @xmath19 denotes the rotational quantum number for h@xmath0 , and likewise @xmath20 for co. in the present study , we adopted the four - dimensional pes for the co - h@xmath0 complex , v@xmath8 , of @xcite .",
    "calculations of the collision energy dependence of state - to - state quenching cross sections for initial rotational states of co , @xmath20=1 , 2 , @xmath21 , 40 , by collisions with both para- and ortho - h@xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath22 , respectively ) were performed .",
    "the cross sections were thermally averaged over the kinetic energy distribution to yield state - to - state rate coefficients from specific initial rotational states @xmath20 as functions of the temperature @xmath23 ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the rotational transition cross section with @xmath20 and @xmath26 being respectively the initial and final rotational quantum number of co , @xmath27 is the reduced mass of the co - h@xmath0 complex , @xmath28 the kinetic energy , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "all state - to - state cross sections and rate coefficients for quenching are available on the uga molecular opacity project website ( www.physast.uga.edu/ugamop/ ) .",
    "the rate coefficients are also available in the format of the leiden atomic and molecular database ( lamda , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on our website and the lamda site ( www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/@xmath31moldata/ ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows typical examples of state - to - state cross sections for @xmath32 and 20 for collisions with para - h@xmath0 .",
    "a number of resonances are evident between 10@xmath33 and 10@xmath34 @xmath6 which result in significant modulation in the rate coefficients .",
    "however , the magnitude of the resonances are seen to decrease with @xmath20 .",
    "cross sections for some other @xmath20 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the cc and cs calculations is shown to be excellent with a difference typically better than @xmath3120% , justifying the adoption of the cs approximation at the higher energies .",
    "quenching rate coefficients from initial rotational states , @xmath20=5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 , at temperatures ranging from 1 to 3000 k are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath35[fig9 ] for co scattering with para- and ortho - h@xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , we are unaware of any experimental rate coefficient data for these initial states . therefore , the current results are compared with the theoretical rate coefficients of @xcite , which were obtained over the limited temperature range , 5 to 400  k , with the v@xmath5 pes .",
    "similar results with v@xmath8 were obtained by @xcite for rotational levels of co up to 5 and temperatures in the range 5@xmath3570 k. wernli _ et al .",

    "the rate coefficients calculated using their analytic relation are almost identical to the current results .    for the quenching of @xmath20=5 due to para - h@xmath0 collisions , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that for temperatures between @xmath311 and 100  k , which is the van der waals interaction - dominated regime , the rate coefficients exhibit an undulatory temperature dependence for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 transitions due to the presence of resonances , . ]",
    "though the magnitude of the undulations decrease with increasing @xmath20",
    ". at temperatures above @xmath31100  k , the rate coefficients generally increase with increasing temperature .",
    "comparison with the rate coefficients of flower shows that at temperatures higher than @xmath3150  k , there is generally good agreement , except for @xmath39 and 2 , where flower s results get larger at temperatures above about 200 k. the results of flower are smaller than the present rate coefficients for lower temperatures with the discrepancy increasing with decreasing temperature .",
    "exceptions to this behavior are the transitions @xmath40 and 4 , in which flower s rate coefficients are generally larger than the present results . for quenching from initial levels @xmath4110 and 20 given in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , respectively , the state - to - state rate coefficients have similar structure to that shown for @xmath32 .",
    "the rate coefficients are dominated by small @xmath42 . for @xmath36 transitions ,",

    "the highest level considered by @xcite for ortho - h@xmath0 collisions was @xmath46 .    comparing figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig9 ] , some general trends can be noted . with few exceptions ,",
    "the state - to - state rate coefficients appear to attain constant values as they decrease to 1  k. however , this is deceptive as an orbiting resonance is typically present in the cross sections for collision energies between @xmath310.01 - 1 @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) computed on the v@xmath8 pes @xcite . for temperatures less than shown ,",
    "the rate coefficients typically decrease ( increase ) prior to the wigner regime @xcite for intermediate ( high ) @xmath20 before eventually attaining finite limiting values , typically below @xmath311 mk .    disregarding the effect of the resonances",
    ", one would expect two possible trends in the relative ordering of the rate coefficient values as a consequence of energy and angular momentum gaps .",
    "the exponential energy gap law @xcite predicts that the rate coefficients should decrease with increasing internal energy difference between the initial and final levels ( i.e. , with increasing @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , co is nearly homonuclear and rotational transitions in homonuclear molecules follow an even @xmath42 propensity rule ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the effect may diminish for large values of @xmath47 .",
    "both effects appear to be important for co - h@xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath48 is the dominant transition for quenching for temperatures greater than @xmath311000 - 3000  k. it is also the dominant transition for temperatures less than @xmath3110  k , but only for @xmath32 and 10 . for other temperatures ,",
    "@xmath36 transitions are predominant , while for some cases @xmath49 is secondary , but with a rate coefficient larger than the @xmath48 transitions .",
    "however , for @xmath50 , the exponential energy gap law appears to be fulfilled in nearly all considered cases .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , carbon monoxide plays an important role in a variety of astrophysical and atmospheric environments and has been detected in countless sources under a variety of excitation conditions .",
    "we discuss a few of these below focusing primarily on observed and predicted transitions from intermediate- and high-@xmath20 in the fir .",
    "rotational emission lines of co have been observed in high - redshift ( @xmath51 ) objects including the quasar sdss j1148 + 5251 at @xmath52 using the very large array . @xcite",
    "modeled the emission from co(@xmath53 ) with @xmath54 with a non - lte radiative transfer code and considered excitation due to h@xmath0 with rate coefficients taken from the lamda database .",
    "they found that the co spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks at @xmath55 at the beginning of the quasar phase , @xmath56 .",
    "observations and modeling of the co emission can serve to probe the hierarchical buildup of the host galaxy and the quasar phase and can be used to estimate the halo mass and quasar host morphology .",
    "@xcite proposed that co emission from @xmath20 as high as 30 could be observed from high-@xmath51 massive accreting black holes using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "such observations could provide a diagnostic of the radiation source : pdr or x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) , for example .",
    "however , as the densities of such objects are typically 10@xmath57 @xmath58 , collisions with the dominant species , h@xmath0 , will determine the co rotational populations . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the critical densities for co due to para - h@xmath0 collisions are plotted ( neglecting optical depth effects ) where the critical density of rotational level @xmath20 is defined as @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath60 are the spontaneous transition probabilities for dipole transitions .",
    "rotational levels @xmath61 are seen to be clearly out of thermal equilibrium for a gas density of 10@xmath57 @xmath58 requiring a non - lte analysis . as the lamda database incorporates the co - h@xmath0 rate coefficients of @xcite and @xcite with extrapolations for para- and ortho - h@xmath0 collisions above @xmath45 and 20 , respectively ,",
    "the predicted co line intensities of @xcite for emission from levels larger than @xmath46 would likely be improved if the current rate coefficients are adopted .",
    "interestingly , their predicted co seds peak at @xmath43 and @xmath62 for pdr and xdr environments , respectively .    the @xmath63 and @xmath64 lines have been observed in the starburst galaxy ngc 253 @xcite . using a non - lte analysis",
    ", @xcite concluded that the cooling in the co lines is so large that it must be balanced by a cosmic ray heating rate @xmath31800 times greater than that in the milky way .",
    "previously , @xcite suggested that highly - excited @xmath20 lines ( e.g. , @xmath65 ) could be detectable from seyfert galaxies giving diagnostics of the internal pressure of the dust - obscured torus .",
    "the _ infrared space observatory _ studied a large variety of pre - main sequence objects ( i.e. , protostars ) and detected numerous fir co rotational lines .",

    "future studies of these protostars , the infrared sources discussed above , and future fir and submillimeter observations with _ herschel _ and alma can benefit from the co - h@xmath0 quenching rate coefficients presented here .",
    "rotational quenching of co due to para- and ortho - h@xmath0 collisions has been studied using an explicit quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach and the coupled - states approximation on the potential surface , v@xmath8 , of @xcite .",
    "state - to - state quenching rate coefficients for initial rotational levels @xmath411 , 2 , @xmath21 , 40 of co are obtained over a wide temperature range and available in tables formatted for astrophysical applications .",
    "resonances result in undulations in the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients with the amplitudes of the undulations typically decreasing with @xmath20 . for temperatures less than @xmath3150  k ,",
    "the current state - to - state rotational quenching rate coefficients obtained with v@xmath8 are found to depart from the results of @xcite obtained with the earlier v@xmath5 pes .",
