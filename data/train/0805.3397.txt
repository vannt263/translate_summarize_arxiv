    "investment optimization , pioneered by markowitz  @xcite , is one of the key topics in finance .",
    "it aims at simultaneous maximization of the investor s capital and minimization of the risk of unfavorable events . when these goals are mathematically formalized , they give rise to various methods of portfolio optimization . in this paper",
    "we focus on the mean  variance method  @xcite and the maximization of the expected exponential growth rate  @xcite . for a thorough review of modern portfolio theory see  @xcite .",
    "most portfolio optimization strategies result in investment diversification as it allows investors to decrease their exposure to the risk of single assets  @xcite . in consequence",
    ", diversification represents a major issue in modern finance theory and practice  @xcite .",
    "the basic premise is that with sufficient diversification one is able to reduce fluctuations to an acceptable level .",
    "however , when assets are correlated , the improvement of investment performance achieved by diversification is reduced  @xcite . since",
    "asset correlations are ubiquitous , ranging from correlations between stocks in one stock market  @xcite to correlations between different investment types in different countries  @xcite , it is important to investigate their influence on diversified portfolios  @xcite .",
    "worse , during financial crises like the one we currently endure , we often observe that when we need diversification the most it often fails us , leading to massive losses  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt to quantify how correlations reduce the benefits of diversification . to achieve this we propose a new measure , the effective size of a diversified portfolio , which is based on a comparison with a fictitious portfolio of uncorrelated assets .",
    "we apply this idea for two different optimization strategies ( the mean  variance portfolio and the kelly portfolio ) and obtain analytical expressions for their effective sizes .",
    "we show that this number is often small , even for a portfolio constructed from a very large number of stocks .",
    "the achieved results are also used to study real market data ( daily prices of stocks from the dow jones industrial average and the s&p  500 ) , showing that the effective portfolio size varies significantly for different sets of stocks and different times .",
    "first we introduce the notation used in this paper .",
    "if the initial and final asset values are @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , the asset return during the given time period is defined as @xmath2 . if we follow the value of asset @xmath3 over many subsequent time periods , it is possible to define the average return @xmath4 , the return variance @xmath5 and the standard deviation @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denotes the average value of @xmath8 ) . to measure correlations of returns ,",
    "the pearson s formula is the standard tool . for assets @xmath3 and @xmath9 it reads @xmath10 by definition @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 . when returns @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent , @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 .",
    "the same holds when one of the assets is risk - free , _",
    "i.e. _ its return has zero variance .",
    "( although in practice each investment carries a certain amount of risk , short term government - issued securities are often used as proxies for risk - free assets . )",
    "we assume that a risk free asset is available and has zero return .",
    "correlation values of all assets form the correlation matrix @xmath17 .",
    "to construct a portfolio , the investor has to divide the current wealth @xmath18 among @xmath19 available assets .",
    "this division can be characterized by investment fractions : @xmath20 is the fraction of wealth invested in asset @xmath3 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "assuming unit initial wealth , after one time period the investor has wealth @xmath22 here @xmath13 is the return of asset @xmath3 during the period .",
    "when investment fractions are fixed , the investor s wealth follows a multiplicative stochastic process and after @xmath23 periods it becomes @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the return of asset @xmath3 in the period @xmath26 .",
    "the mean  variance approach to portfolio optimization has been proposed by markowitz  @xcite , for later discussions see @xcite . despite its flaws ( _ e.g. _ , only the expected return and its variance are used to characterize a portfolio ) it is still a  benchmark for other optimization methods . for any portfolio , we can compute the expected return @xmath27 and the variance @xmath28 as @xmath29 the optimal portfolio is defined as the one that minimizes @xmath30 for a  given @xmath31 ( equivalently , one can maximize @xmath31 with @xmath30 fixed ) .",
    "to focus purely on the influence of correlations on the optimization process , we assume that all @xmath19 games are identical : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the minimal portfolio variance @xmath34 then has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inverse of the correlation matrix @xmath17 .",
    "the larger is the expected portfolio return , the larger is the optimal variance .",
    "now we look at eq .",
    "( [ mv - v_p ] ) from a new perspective : we compare it with the optimal variance of the portfolio of @xmath37 uncorrelated assets with identical mean returns and variances which is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is @xmath40 identity matrix .",
    "we can introduce the effective size of the correlated portfolio , @xmath41 , by comparing the two optimal variances .",
    "the equation @xmath42 can be solved with respect to @xmath41 , yielding @xmath43 in other words : when investing in @xmath19 correlated assets , the portfolio variance is the same as for @xmath41 uncorrelated assets .",
    "note that @xmath41 depends only on the correlation matrix and not on the portfolio parameters @xmath44 .",
    "a similar sum over the elements of the inverse correlation matrix arises in the expression for the magnetic susceptibility in the ising model ( which is a prominent model of magnetism in theoretical physics ) .    to better understand the new concept",
    ", we examine the special case of uniform correlations between the assets : @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 $ ] . then @xmath36 has the form @xmath48},\\quad ( { \\mathsf{c}}^{-1})_{ij}=\\frac{-c}{(1-c)[1+(m-1)c]}.\\ ] ] and eq .",
    "( [ m_ef - mv - general ] ) consequently simplifies to @xmath49",
    "now we can get some intuition about the effective portfolio size : when @xmath50 ( perfectly correlated assets ) , @xmath51 ; when @xmath52 ( uncorrelated assets ) , @xmath53 ; when @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the portfolio variance can be totally eliminated and @xmath56 . a remarkable consequence of eq .",
    "( [ m_ef - mv - c ] ) is that in the limit @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 .",
    "this means that diversification into arbitrary many assets with mutual correlation @xmath59 is equivalent to investment in only @xmath60 uncorrelated assets .",
    "another interesting case is a  block diagonal matrix @xmath17 which has square matrices @xmath61 along the main diagonal and the off - diagonal blocks are zero matrices ( such a form of @xmath17 is an extreme case of the sector structure discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - sectors ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ m_ef - mv - general ] ) then yields @xmath62 thus , the effective portfolio size is the sum of effective sizes for each block @xmath63 separately .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results obtained above with the simple investment distributed evenly among all assets .",
    "if we assume identical returns and variances of the assets , eq .  ( [ randv ] ) simplifies to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the fraction of wealth invested in each single asset .",
    "the desired value of @xmath31 now determines both @xmath66 and @xmath30 . by comparison with the variance of a portfolio of uncorrelated assets",
    "we obtain the effective size of the even investment in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the average of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath17 , the prime symbol indicates that the even investment is considered .",
    "we shall see ( sec .",
    "[ sec - real ] ) that @xmath69 is often significantly smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "we emphasize that the effective portfolio size @xmath41 is different from the inverse participation ratio ( also called the herfindahl index ) which is defined as @xmath70 ( @xmath20 is the fraction of wealth invested in asset @xmath3 ) .",
    "while the former quantifies the influence of correlations , the latter quantifies how unevenly wealth is distributed among the assets .",
    "the kelly portfolio  @xcite maximizes the investment performance in the long run and has several interesting mathematical properties  @xcite .",
    "its applicability was investigated in many different situations  @xcite , including those with limited information  @xcite , and it has been successfully used in real financial markets  @xcite . in the following paragraphs",
    "we show how the effective portfolio size can be introduce for the kelly portfolio .    since @xmath71 given by eq .",

    "consequently , the long - run exponential growth rate @xmath73 can be written in the form @xmath74 maximization of this quantity is the main criterion for the construction of the kelly portfolio . using the law of large numbers",

    "the maximization of @xmath73 then yields the optimal fraction @xmath82 which is the celebrated kelly criterion ( if short positions are not allowed , @xmath83 for @xmath84 : it is optimal to abstain from the game ) .",
    "( [ g ] ) , allowing no analytical solution for @xmath85 , can be maximized by numerical techniques  @xcite or by analytical approximations  @xcite as we do below .      to investigate the effect of asset correlations on the kelly portfolio , we consider @xmath19 individual assets with the correlation between assets @xmath3 and @xmath9 computed by eq .",

    ", we can use the expansion @xmath93 to obtain @xmath94 this set of linear equations gives the first approximation to @xmath20 : when @xmath95 and @xmath96 are known , the optimal investment fractions @xmath97 follow . a higher order expansion of @xmath98 results in higher order cross terms of returns which are generally difficult to compute .",
    "as before , to focus on the influence of correlations we assume identical return distributions of the assets : we set @xmath99 and @xmath33 for @xmath21 , consequently @xmath100 .",
    "after substitution to eq .",

    "the effective portfolio size @xmath41 is again obtained by a comparison with a portfolio of uncorrelated assets .",
    "one way to do this is by comparing the total invested wealth in both cases .",
    "that is , @xmath41 is defined as the solution of @xmath104 using eq .",
    "( [ kelly - fvector ] ) we readily obtain @xmath105 which is exactly the same expression for @xmath41 as eq .",
    "( [ m_ef - mv - general ] ) in the mean  variance approach .",
    "we can conclude that the effective portfolio size is a common quantity for these two optimization schemes . nevertheless , this exact correspondence is valid only when the first order approximation is used to solve eq .",
    "( [ hetero - g ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to define the effective number of assets @xmath41 differently : as the number of uncorrelated assets when the expected exponential growth rate @xmath106 is equal to the growth rate @xmath107 with @xmath19 correlated assets .",
    "this definition is similar to the one introduced above and it also yields similar results . for practical reasons ( the total investment fraction is easier to handle analytically than the exponential growth rate ) we confine our analysis to the former definition .",
    "assuming identical asset correlations , @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 $ ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ m_ef - kelly - general ] ) simplifies to @xmath108 we remind that while eq .",

    "this effect can be ignored because changes of the divisor are mostly negligible .    during the given period ,",
    "the variance of the djia daily returns was @xmath148 , the average variance of the daily returns of the djia stocks was @xmath149 .",
    "these two figures contradict the assumption of zero correlations because then the variance should scale with the number of assets @xmath19 as @xmath150 ( this follows also from eq .",
