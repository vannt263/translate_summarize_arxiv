    "<S> this phenomenon has been proposed as a signal of quark gluon plasma formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand explanations based on string models have also been proposed @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite enhancement of @xmath2 s and @xmath5 s was described in the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite with final state interaction . </S>",
    "<S> an important drawback of @xcite is the lack of nucleon stopping which would increase the net baryon yield at mid rapidities . as a consequence a very strong effect due to final state interaction was needed , as well as a rather large value of the fraction of strange quarks in the nucleon sea . </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism of nuclear stopping based on diquark breaking ( db ) has been known for a long time @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been introduced in nucleus - nucleus interactions @xcite-@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is threefold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we propose a new formulation of the db stopping mechanism of @xcite-@xcite , which allows to describe net baryon stopping without any dynamical parameter governing the db probability . </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that the dpm with db and strings with diquarks  antidiquark pairs ( @xmath6-@xmath7 ) from the sea at their ends , allows to describe most of the observed yields of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 but significantly underestimates the production of @xmath4 s and @xmath9 s . </S>",
    "<S> third , using the corresponding baryon densities as initial conditions for final state interaction we achieve a reasonable description of all baryon and antibaryon production .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 truemm    we describe baryon stopping via the mechanism shown in fig .  1 the same as fig .  5 of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to @xcite we assume here that there is no dynamical suppression associated to db i.e . the weight of the db diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is the same as the conventional dp one of fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in the case of a single inelastic collision per nucleon ( two string configuration ) , two valence quarks of the nucleon are sitting together at a string end . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that they form a sort of compact object which hadronizes in the conventional way ( dp mechanism ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the presence of several inelastic collisions we assume that the net baryon number ( string junction ) has equal probability of finding itself in any of them . if it follows the valence diquark ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) we have the conventional dp situation . in the other cases it joins with sea quarks producing a much slower baryon ( db mechanism of fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity distribution of the net baryon production @xmath10 in @xmath11 collisions is then given by    [ 1e ] dn^aab dy ( y ) = |n_a |n .    here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the average number of participants in each nucleus and @xmath13 the average number of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is given by the conventional dp hadronization mechanism and @xmath15 is the rapidity density given by the db component which behaves @xcite as @xmath16 $ ] . at high energies has been proposed in @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has very important consequences for the net baryon number at @xmath17 at lhc @xcite . a new component consisting on a diquark which contains a quark from the nucleon sea also has been introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case the diquark hadronizes as a valence diquark producing baryons mainly in the fragmentation regions . ] </S>",
    "<S> both distributions depend , due to energy - conservation , on the average number of collisions per nucleon @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath19 , only the dp component is present and we recover the usual scaling in the number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> baryon number conservation implies that both dp and db rapidity distributions are normalized in such a way that their integral over @xmath20 is equal to two . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we have    [ 2e ] dn_db^b dy ( y ) = c_|n/|n_a ( z_+^1/2 ( 1 - z_+)^_|n/|n_a + z_-^1/2 ( 1 - z_-)^_|n/|n_a )    where @xmath21 . the same shape will be used for all baryon species . </S>",
    "<S> two different ansatzs for the power @xmath22 were proposed in @xcite which give for central @xmath1 collisions @xmath23 a value of @xmath24 at @xmath17 in the range 0.5 to 0.60 . in order to reproduce the data of the na49 collaboration @xcite for @xmath25-@xmath26 at @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we need a value 0.48 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis will concentrate on mid - rapidities and this value will be used throughout this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1e ] ) also applies to @xmath28 collisions putting @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this applies only at low energies where the two string configuration dominates . at high energies </S>",
    "<S> the second term in ( [ 1e ] ) is present and increases the net baryon stopping . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the only available data at isr do not allow to either confirm or rule out the presence of the db component . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of this component is quite important in @xmath30 collisions where the @xmath0 data of @xcite confirm its presence ( see below ) . in dpm , the extension of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1e ] ) to @xmath30 collisions is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> a good approximation to the exact formula , valid at @xmath31 , is    [ 3e ] dn^pa b dy(0 ) = |n 2  dn^ppb dy(0 ) + 1 2 ( dn^b dy ( 0 ) ) _ |n .    here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 and @xmath33 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1e ] ) with @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3e ] ) is self - evident . on the nucleus side </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath13 diquarks which hadronizes as in @xmath28 collisions ( the average number of collisions per nucleon at present energies is close to one in both cases ) . on the proton side </S>",
    "<S> , we have one diquark which hadronizes as in @xmath11 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> ( the average number of collisions of this nucleon in @xmath0 and in central @xmath1 collisions is practically the same ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3e ] ) is very useful since it gives the rapidity density of the net baryon in @xmath0 , in terms of the same quantities which appear in @xmath1 ( eq . ( [ 1e ] ) ) plus the corresponding one for @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 truemm    following @xcite the rapidity distributions of antibaryons in @xmath11 collisions is given by    [ 4e ] dn^aa |b dy(y ) = |n_a ( dn^|b_string dy(y ) ) _ </S>",
    "<S> |n/|n_a + ( |n - |n_a ) ( dn^|b_sea dy(y ) ) _ |n/|n_a .    </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath35 denotes the conventional pair production resulting from @xmath6-@xmath7 production in the string breaking process . at present energies the @xmath36-@xmath37 strings have too little energy for baryon pair production  ; practically all their production occurs in @xmath38-@xmath36 strings , hence the scaling in the number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a much too small antibaryon yield . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we have introduced @xcite the second term in ( [ 4e ] ) which corresponds to pair production in strings with a @xmath6 or @xmath7 from the nucleon sea at one of their ends . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of @xmath6-@xmath7 pairs scales as @xmath13-@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath39 , the scaling in the number of participants is converted into a scaling in the number of collisions .    for @xmath30 collisions </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent of expression ( [ 3e ] ) , valid at @xmath27 , is    [ 5e ] dn^pa|b dy(0 ) = |n 2  dn^pp |b dy(0 ) + 1 2 ( dn^|b dy ( 0))_|n    here @xmath32 and @xmath40 is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4e ] ) with @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 truemm    let us concentrate first on the non - conventional contributions ( second terms in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1e]-[3e ] ) and ( [ 4e]-[5e ] ) ) which are numerically very important since they contain the factor @xmath13-@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , @xmath41 has been computed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as stated there , there is a huge uncertainty on its absolute normalization . in view of that </S>",
    "<S> , we are going to determine it from @xmath30 data . </S>",
    "<S> since data @xcite for multi - strange hyperons are only available in the rapidity range @xmath42 we shall restrict our analysis to this region .    </S>",
    "<S> turning to the relative yields of the different baryon species , we note that in @xmath41 the baryons and antibaryons are produced from three sea quarks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the factors controlling the relative yields are  : @xmath43 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we use for both baryons and antibaryons the conventional relation @xmath52 , which is obtained after resonance decay . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the strangeness suppression factor has the conventional value @xmath55 and the sum of all baryon yields add up to @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this fixes only the relative normalization of the various ( anti ) baryon species and there is one free parameter which provides the absolute normalization which is fixed by the data . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained values are given in table i.    the situation is quite different for the new component @xmath57 . here </S>",
    "<S> net baryon conservation fixes the absolute normalization and therefore there is in principle no free parameter since the strangeness suppression factors are the same as above . </S>",
    "<S> however , it turns out that proceeding in this way the strange baryon yields in @xmath30 are overestimated especially @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s . a possible explanation of this fact is that , at present energies , it may happen that the baryon is not formed out of three sea quarks as in fig .  1 , but , due to lack of phase space , the valence quark at the string end </S>",
    "<S> is picked up instead in agreement with tevatron @xcite and sps collider @xcite data . ] . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the relative yields of @xmath2 s of @xmath3 s will be reduced and that of @xmath4 s will be zero . in any case , we take here a phenomenological attitude . we determine the strange net baryon yields at @xmath27 from the data . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus three free parameters @xmath2-@xmath5 , @xmath51-@xmath58 and @xmath4-@xmath9 plus a forth parameter for the absolute normalization of antibaryons as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive in this way to the values listed in table i.    finally , the conventional components @xmath14 and @xmath59 have been obtained in two different ways  : using the formalism of ref . @xcite and using the qgsm @xcite monte carlo without string fusion collisions @xcite , have been tuned up , and its results in @xmath28 collisions are now in agreement with the calculations of @xcite and with the experimental data ( see table 1 in ) . ] . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> the obtained values are given in table i. it should be noted that the contribution of these conventional components to the final results is significantly smaller than the one of the new components , since the latter are proportional to @xmath13-@xmath12 .    with the values given in tables i </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the results shown in figs .  3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath30 data are well reproduced for all baryon species . in @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 and most of the @xmath61 yield are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath62 yield is somewhat underestimated and the @xmath63 one is five times smaller than the measured one .    in an attempt to solve this problem , we use our expressions ( [ 1e ] ) and ( [ 4e ] ) as initial baryon densities for final state interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following channels    [ 6e ] n k  , n k  , k  , k  , k ,    plus the corresponding ones for antiparticles - channel . </S>",
    "<S> they have not been included . </S>",
    "<S> all reactions corresponding to quark diagrams with light quark annihilation and @xmath64-@xmath65 production have been included with identical cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected all strangeness exchange reactions @xmath66 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> although , at threshold , the cross - sections are larger than those of the non - strangeness exchange reactions ( ) , this is no longer the case for the averaged cross - sections @xmath67 ( see ) . channels ( ) are thus dominant due to the relations @xmath68 between baryon densities . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the final state interaction is treated in the same way as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the products of densities in ( [ 6e ] ) are taken at fixed values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> for the baryon densities , the dependence on these variables is contained in the geometrical factors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1e ] ) and ( [ 4e ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are computed in the glauber model with saxon - woods profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the pion densities and the initial and final times are the same as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference resides in the fact that , in the case of @xmath71 suppression , there is a single channel and the @xmath71 appears both in the initial and final state . in this case , the differential equations for the gain and loss of particles can be solved analytically and a simple exponential form is obtained . in the present case , the gain and loss differential equations for the solution of the coupled channels ( [ 6e ] ) has to be obtained numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we have only one free parameter  : the cross - section @xmath67 averaged over the momentum distribution of the incoming particles which is taken to be the same for all reactions ( the relative velocity between the interacting particles is included in @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath72  fm . </S>",
    "<S> ( a comparable value has been obtained in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the relative enhancement of the various baryon and antibaryon yields resulting from the interactions ( [ 6e ] ) will be the largest for @xmath4 s and the smallest for @xmath2 s . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that @xmath2 s are produced in some reactions and destroyed in others . on the contrary @xmath4 s </S>",
    "<S> are produced and never destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figs .  3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable description of all baryon and antibaryon is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratio @xmath73 in @xmath1 collisions is slightly underestimated .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 truemm    in conclusion , we have introduced a new formulation of the diquark breaking mechanism which describes baryon stopping with a diquark breaking probability equal to one . incorporated in dpm , together with strings originating from diquark - antidiquark pairs from the nucleon sea and final state interactions </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a reasonable description of all baryon and antibaryon yields at mid - rapidities in @xmath28 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions .    </S>",
