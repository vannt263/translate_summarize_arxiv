    "detailed investigation of populations in local group ( lg ) galaxies using stellar photometry has recently become very popular ( aparicio 1998 ) .",
    "this is a direct way to study the populations and evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , even for lg objects it is difficult to reach the required photometry depth . to reconstruct the star formation history of more distant galaxies",
    "a different techniques should be applied .",
    "historically , the most popular method is an evolutionary population synthesis ( tinsley 1980 ; arimoto & yoshii 1986 ) , which treats the entire galaxy as a single zone unit .",
    "such an approach is probably satisfactorily applicable only for ellipticals .",
    "however , it seems too simplified in the case of spiral disks . to improve the tools available for the evolutionary analysis of galaxies , a new method for multicolor mapping",
    "is introduced and applied for the interacting galaxy pair ngc5194/95 ( hereafter , m51 system ) .",
    "m51 is a well studied nearby system of two overlapping galaxies seen nearly face - on , and therefore suitable for testing new methods and @xmath1 mapping techniques .",
    "since the interpretation of the results of optical photometry always suffer from the influence of dust residing in galaxies , it is important to know the extinction properties of the galaxies under consideration . for this purpose ,",
    "overlapping galaxies are particularly suitable , allowing precise derivation of an attenuation law and the amount of the extinction in the foreground galaxy ( white & keel 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , results of an extensive dynamical modeling of m51 are available ( barnes 1998 ) , and hence can be used for a comparison of the photometrically derived parameters with the ones determined by other independent methods .",
    "observations were carried out at kiso observatory ( japan ) using the @xmath2 schmidt telescope on february 17 & 18 and march 7 , 1994 . the ccd camera tek 1024 ( read - out noise @xmath3 , scale @xmath4 , and field of view @xmath5 ) was used . the open cluster m67 was observed every night as a standard field .",
    "more than 150 exposures of m51 of @xmath6 seconds duration and image quality of @xmath7 were taken in total .",
    "the standard @xmath8 and narrow - band @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) filters , together with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) filter of vilnius system .",
    "standard reductions were made with iraf .",
    "the @xmath1 aperture photometry ( scanning the entire field with a constant step of @xmath13 and aperture of @xmath14 ) was performed using an afo package ( bridius & vanseviius 1998 ) .    assuming the distance to the m51 system to be equal to @xmath15 ( feldmeier , ciardullo , & jacoby 1997 )",
    ", each circular @xmath14 aperture corresponds to the region of @xmath16 in galaxies ( hereafter , zone ) . in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) zones of both galaxies are shown separately .",
    "for further discussion we use only precisely measured ( @xmath17 ) zones with @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noting the different morphologies and fine structures of both cmds ( fig .",
    "1 ) . most of the `` streaming features '' are parallel to the reddening arrow , and can be attributed to the dust influence .",
    "the problem of dustiness of galaxies at different evolutionary stages is widely discussed recently . in particular , the dilemma of whether the spiral disks are optically thick or thin is debated ( davies & burstein 1995 ) . to clarify the problem of spiral disk dustiness",
    ", we determine the amount of extinction and the attenuation curve in ngc5194 using ngc5195 as a tracer .",
    "the facts supporting the validity of such a method are : a ) ngc5195 is behind ngc5194 ; b ) ngc5195 is a source bright enough to have a high @xmath0 ratio even in the most obscured parts of the galaxy ; c ) ngc5195 is found to be a regular s0 galaxy in the near - infrared ( thronson , rubin , & ksir 1991 ) , therefore it is possible to compare symmetrically located zones .",
    "we measured two regions ( symmetric with respect to the ngc5195 center and bar ) , each consisting of 50 zones ( @xmath19 ) at an average distance of @xmath20 from the center .",
    "visual inspection of the @xmath21 image helped to locate the region relatively free of dust signatures , and then the corresponding dusty region was chosen on the opposite side of the center and bar .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 histograms of the investigated zones are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the parameters of the derived attenuation curve are given in table i ( definition of the extinction : @xmath24 , is used ) .",
    "the derived median value of the extinction for the interarm region at @xmath25 distance from the center of ngc5194 is @xmath26 .",
    ".properties of the extinction in ngc5194 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     numerous determinations of the amount of extinction in ngc5194 have recently been obtained .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) derived @xmath27 using ngc5195 as a tracing source .",
    "rix & rieke ( 1993 ) put a limit on the global optical depth of ngc5194 disk of @xmath28 .",
    "nakai & kuno ( 1995 ) determined @xmath29 , based on a study of 37 @xmath30 regions in the disk of ngc5194 .",
    "beckman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that optical depth in the @xmath22 band , averaged out to a radius of three scale lengths from the center of ngc5194 , is 0.7 .",
    "these results mainly ascribe properties of the arm regions , however they do not contradict our conclusion that the disk of ngc5194 is opaque in the interarm regions even at a large distance from the center .",
    "however , such a conclusion is in contradiction with the one drawn by white , keel , & conselice ( 1996 ) from a study of nine overlapping galaxy systems .",
    "they derived the extinction @xmath31 in the arm and @xmath32 in the interarm regions .",
    "ngc3314 is the only system in their sample which possesses significant extinction in the arm ( @xmath33 ) and in the interarm ( @xmath34 ) regions , which supports our conclusion that some of the spiral disks are opaque even in the interarm regions .",
    "the color excess ratios derived for the outer part of the disk are very close to those of the milky way ( mw ) extinction law .",
    "taking into account the same conclusion reported by panagia et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the central part of ngc5194 , we assume that color excess ratios are constant throughout the disk of this galaxy .",
    "to avoid the age - abundance degeneracy in determining the effective age of zones , global distribution of the abundance should be derived .",
    "abundance analysis of @xmath30 regions ( daz et al . 1991 ; zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) indicates the mean abundance to be above solar : @xmath35 , with a gradient equal to @xmath36 . alternatively , hill et al .",
    "( 1997 ) explained the observed uv color gradient in terms of radial extinction gradient , rather than of abundance .",
    "we define an abundance parameter ( independent of the extinction ) as follows : @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is a measure of @xmath39 spectral feature strength , which is a good abundance indicator ( barbuy 1994 ; casuso et al .",
    "plotting @xmath38 vs. radial distances from the galaxy centers , we do not see the abundance gradient except for the very central region inside the radius of @xmath40 .",
    "however , a significant difference of abundances between ngc5194 and ngc5195 is found .",
    "therefore , deriving the ages of zones we assume no abundance gradient across the disk of both galaxies .",
    "the abundances z=0.05 for ngc5194 and z=0.02 for ngc5195 are adopted , respectively .",
    "such an assumption does not significantly affect differential analysis of the age distribution of populations in the disk outside the inner lindblad resonance ( radius @xmath41 ) of ngc5194 ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & seiden 1989 ) , and outside the comparable radius in ngc5195 .",
    "let us introduce a parameter @xmath42 as a measure of the effective age of each zone , which is again extinction - independent . actually , both @xmath43 formulae are only correct in the case of a star residing behind the dust cloud ( screen ) .",
    "the validity of dusty screen approximation in the case of face - on galaxies was shown by gonzlez & graham ( 1996 ) . diagram @xmath22",
    "vs. @xmath44 constructed from our data sample , in contrast to figure 1 , shows no prominent `` streaming features '' , which can be attributed to the influence of extinction .",
    "all this indicates that @xmath44 is a reddening - free parameter in the case of face - on galaxies .",
    "figure 3a shows calibration of @xmath44 vs. age for single ( age ) stellar populations ( ssps ) calculated from the model spectra library gissel96 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "figure 3b provides histograms of the parameter @xmath44 for both galaxies of the m51 system , which are simply separated by declination .",
    "a significant difference in age between the two galaxies is obvious even if the interfering influence of the northern arm of ngc5194 projected onto ngc5195 is neglected .",
    "the derived ages of the bulk of population in ngc5194 & ngc5195 are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . the gray - coded population age distribution in galaxies is shown in figure 4 .",
    "recent dynamic modeling suggests two starbursts in m51 , the first less than @xmath47 ago and the second one @xmath48 ago ( see barnes ( 1998 ) for discussion ) .",
    "we derive the age for a bulk of zones in ngc5194 to be @xmath49 , in good agreement with the dynamical prediction .",
    "zones in ngc5195 are @xmath50 older . if one assumes this age difference to be a characteristic time between two close - up passages , the predicted age @xmath51 for the last passage again is in good agreement with the dynamical modeling .",
    "therefore , our study indicates that the evolutionary scenario of m51 has had at least three periods of activity .",
    "the first starburst occurred @xmath52 ago in ngc5195 during a close - up passage with ngc5194 , when , probably , ngc5195 was transformed to an s0 galaxy .",
    "the next starburst took place after @xmath53 , when the bulk of the population in ngc5194 was formed , and finally the last one occurred again after @xmath53 when the present grand - design appearance of ngc5194 was `` touched up '' .",
    "main conclusions are the following : a ) the attenuation law determined in ngc5194 is close to mw standard extinction law ; b ) the opaque interarm region at distance @xmath25 from the center of ngc5194 supports optically thick models of spiral disks ; c ) the derived effective age @xmath48 for the bulk of ngc5194 zones agrees well with the predictions of recent dynamic modeling of m51 ; d ) the effective age @xmath52 derived for the bulk of zones in ngc5195 implies a scenario with three periods of starburst activity",
    ". however , more sophisticated radiative transfer models and realistic star - dust distributions as well as @xmath1 models of the evolution of spiral disks , instead of simple ssp approach , are crucial for the interpretation of the mapping data .",

    "kiso observatory s staff is also generously acknowledged .",
    "i am indebted to k. zdanaviius for providing photoelectric measurements of m51 in vilnius system .",
