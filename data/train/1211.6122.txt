    "the spatial ( and color ) distribution of star light in a galaxy is thought to encode information about its formation history , so there has been considerable interest in developing accurate descriptions of the projected surface brightness distribution of galaxies .",
    "one approach to this problem is to fit the free parameters of a predetermined functional form to the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "these derived free parameters ( typically , these are expressed in terms of the scale which contains half the total light , and the surface brightness at this scale ) are more useful if the functional form itself actually does provide a good fit to the profile .",
    "a simple version of this approach is to fit many different functional forms to the data , and then select the one which provides the best fit ( in some suitably quantified way ) .",
    "for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) reports fits of both exponential ( @xmath14 ) and de  vaucouleurs ( @xmath15 $ ] ) profiles to the image , along with an estimate of which fits better .    the exponential and de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profiles are special cases ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) of the sersic ( 1968 ) profile @xmath18.\\ ] ] with sufficiently good data , it is possible to simply fit a sersic profile to the data , leaving the fitting procedure to determine @xmath3 as well as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if galaxies really are intrinsically single sersics with a wide range of @xmath3 , then the parameters ( e.g. half - light radius ) returned by forcing @xmath16 or @xmath17 in the single component fits will generally be biased . across the population as a whole ,",
    "the derived value of @xmath3 spans a wide range , sometimes being as large as @xmath21 or 10 ( e.g. simard et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) , suggesting that forcing @xmath16 or @xmath17 is ill - advised .    of course , it is not obvious that the light profile should be fit using a single component .",
    "the stellar kinematics in many galaxies indicate that the stars define more than one dynamical component .",
    "examples include counter - rotating disks , as well as disk systems with bulges or bars in their centers ( e.g. emsellem et al . 2011 ) .",
    "evidence for more than one component is often seen in the chemical composition as well ( e.g. johnston et al . 2012 ) . in such galaxies , it is interesting to see if the light profile also indicates the presence of more than one component .",
    "this has motivated studies which model the observed profile as the sum of an exponential and a devaucouleurs profile ; what we will call the devexp model .",
    "( of course , since there are now more free parameters to be fit , better , higher resolution data are required . in this context , it is worth noting that sersic s initial motivation was to fit a functional form with fewer free parameters which would allow one to interpolate between two - component systems having varying fractions of an @xmath22 bulge and an @xmath16 disk . )",
    "it is common to report the result of such two - component fits in terms of the fraction of the total light that is in the bulge ( de  vaucouleurs ) component :",
    "b / t . correlations of these b / t values with other parameters ( e.g. luminosity ) are then used to constrain formation history scenarios .    on the other hand ,",
    "if galaxies really are single component sersics , and one attempts to fit them with two component devexp profiles , then one will infer an entirely spurious b / t value ( the profile was , after all , just a single component ) .",
    "this spurious b / t will correlate with other parameters if @xmath3 itself does , complicating the interpretation of such correlations .",
    "indeed , some have argued that the evidence for two - components in the light profile is sometimes just a consequence of trying to fit what is really a single component sersic with a linear combination of exponential and devaucouleurs profiles ( e.g. graham et al .",
    "2003 ) , although this leaves unanswered the question of why dynamically or chemically distinct components do not leave a signature in the light .    in recent years , the correlation between size and luminosity for early - type galaxies has received much attention , because high redshift early - types appear to be more compact than their counterparts at low redshift ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 ; cimatti et al .",
    "2008 ; bruce et al .",
    "however , both the size and the luminosity estimates , @xmath23 and @xmath12 , are derived parameters , obtained by fitting to the observed surface brightness distribution . as a result , they depend on assumptions about the intrinsic shape of the surface brightness profile . e.g. , if the fit assumes that galaxies are made up of two components or just one , and if two , whether they are modelled as the sum of an exponential and a devaucouleurs ( 1948 ) profile , an exponential and a sersic ( 1968 ) , or two sersics .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to quantify the systematics on the local @xmath5 relation which are associated with the choice of a particular model . in practice ,",
    "` local ' means the @xmath24 galaxies at @xmath0 in dr7 of the sdss main galaxy sample ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) . because this sample is apparent magnitude limited ( @xmath25 ) , in practice , by @xmath5 relation we always mean @xmath26 fitted as a function of absolute magnitude ( see sheth & bernardi 2012 for a simple description of the bias which would arise from fitting @xmath12 as a function of @xmath23 ) . and @xmath23 denotes the radius which encloses half the total light @xmath12 .",
    "( for exponential disks , this radius is 1.67 times the scale length of the exponential . in the case of two components ,",
    "@xmath23 is a complicated function of the light in each component and the two scale radii . )",
    "our goal implies that we must fit the observed profiles and determine the associated @xmath5 relation using a variety of different models .",
    "section  [ sdss ] summarizes the relevant properties of the sdss dr7 sample we study .",
    "section  [ 2components ] provides an analysis of the light profiles of sdss dr7 galaxies which we believe strongly suggests that fitting to a serexp model returns the least biased answers .",
    "section  [ lr ] compares the @xmath5 relation based on single sersic , sersic + exponential , devaucouleur + exponential , and single devaucouleur fits , showing that the relations from single sersic fits ( the standard to date ) are offset to larger sizes and those from single devaucouleur fits to smaller sizes , compared to those from the two - component fits .",
    "there is no particular reason why systems supported by rotational motions should define the same @xmath5 relation as those supported by random motions .",
    "therefore , it makes little sense to speak of a single @xmath5 relation for the entire galaxy population .",
    "indeed , the @xmath5 relation has long been known to depend on morphological type ( e.g. shen et al .",
    "section  [ lrmorph ] quantifies this morphological dependence , and then focuses on the differences between the relations defined by early - type bulge dominated systems , and later type disk - dominated systems .",
    "disk dominated galaxies have small bulges , and bulge dominated galaxies have extended second components . in section  [ bd ]",
    "we use our sersic - exponential fits to study the @xmath10 relation of early - types , @xmath8 of late types , and the ratio of the bulge size to that of the other component in both early- and late - types .",
    "note that we do not distinguish between bars and bulges in late - type galaxies but none of our science goals depend on this distinction .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings .",
    "in this paper , we study the galaxies in the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the sdss main galaxy sample ( abazajian et al .",
    "this sample contains @xmath27 galaxies at @xmath0 , and is apparent magnitude limited to @xmath25 , where @xmath28 is a petrosian magnitude .",
    "this limit is sufficiently bright that surface brightness related selection effects are negligible .",
    "the dr7 database provides crude estimates of the ( galactic extinction corrected ) apparent brightness and angular size of each galaxy in the catalog .",
    "we will use the sdss - based cmodel magnitudes and sizes ( a weighted combination of separate fits to exponential and devaucouleurs profiles ) defined in bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . when converting these to physical sizes and luminosities , we assume a flat @xmath29cdm model with @xmath30 and a hubble constant whose present value is @xmath31  km  s@xmath32mpc@xmath32 .",
    "the luminosities are @xmath33-corrected following bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . for colors we use sdss dr7 model magnitudes ( corrected for galactic extinction ) .",
    "the database also provides estimates of the stellar velocity dispersion of each galaxy .",
    "we follow custom and correct these values for aperture effects following bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "in the first half of this paper , we describe a number of other estimates of the total light associated with each @xmath1-band image ( analysis of the images in other bands is ongoing ) .",
    "however , recent work has focussed on stellar masses @xmath13 rather than luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "our estimated stellar masses come from combining our estimates of @xmath34 with @xmath35 estimated following bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) assuming a chabrier imf .",
    "one of our primary goals is to quantify how the @xmath5 relation depends on how @xmath23 and @xmath12 were estimated . to this end",
    ", we perform fits to the sdss dr7 main galaxy sample images using the pymorph package , which can fit seeing convolved two - component models to observed surface brightness profiles ( vikram et al .",
    "2010 ; see their figs.46 for a discussion of the steps involved , and choices made regarding e.g. , the pixels to be masked , centering and alignment of the two components , etc . ) . the algorithm is described and tested in meert et al .",
    "( 2013 ) who show that when the fitted functional form is the same as the one used to generate the image , then pymorph returns accurate values of the free - parameters ( e.g. , background sky - level , total light , half - light radius , sersic index , axis - ratio , bulge - total ratio ) .",
    "we use pymorph to fit single component devaucouleurs and sersic profiles , and two component exponential + devaucouleur ( devexp ) and exponential + sersic ( serexp ) profiles to each image .",
    "it is conventional to speak of the two components as being ` bulge ' and ` disk ' components ; while this is accurate for disk - dominated systems ( typically later - type galaxies ) , it may be better to think of the ` disk ' component in bulge - dominated systems ( typically early - type galaxies ) as simply being a second component that is not necessarily a ( thin , inclined ) disk ( e.g. oemler 1976 ; schombert 1986 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 ) .    before moving on",
    ", we note that there is an analytic expression for the light enclosed within a given distance of the center of a single circular sersic profile ( e.g. ciotti & bertin 1999 ) . from this",
    ", the half light radius can be obtained easily . however , if the object has axis ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the half - light radii along the principal axes of the image , then the corresponding expression must be integrated numerically . since this can be time - consuming , it is usual to approximate this case by using the expression for a circle , but with a suitably chosen effective circular radius .",
    "the most common choice is @xmath39 , but saglia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have recently shown that @xmath40 is more accurate : for bulge dominated systems the difference matters little , but it does matter for disks .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath40 except in section  [ lrsersic ] where , to fairly compare with previous work , we use @xmath41 .",
    "this raises the question of what we should do when we have two components ?",
    "a natural choice would be to circularize each component using its own @xmath40 , and to then determine the half light radius of the sum of the circularized components , where each is weighted by the fraction of the total light that it contains ( e.g. equation  [ rhbt ] in the appendix ) .",
    "we have found that this approximation is quite accurate , so we use it throughout .",
    "a secondary goal of this paper is to quantify the role of galaxy type or morphology on the @xmath5 relation . in practice",
    "this is difficult , because unambiguous determinations of the morphological type are not straightforward , although the task is slightly easier for bulge dominated systems .",
    "previous work has used crude proxies for morphological type : these include isophotal shape and central concentration ( strateva et al . 2001 ) , the sersic index @xmath3 ( shen et al .",
    "2003 ) , the color , spectral features , and some combination of the above ( bernardi et al . 2003a",
    "; baldry et al . 2004 ) .    in what follows , we use the bayesian automated classifications ( hereafter bac ) of huertas - company et al .",
    "( 2011 ) which are available for our full dr7 sample .",
    "the bac classifications are particularly interesting , because they are expressed as probabilistic weights ( determined from an object s @xmath33-corrected @xmath42 and @xmath43 colors , and its isophotal shape and light concentration in the @xmath44-band )  something we expect will become increasingly common in the next generation of large datasets .",
    "we explore the use of hard cuts based on these weights as indicators of morphology , as well as simply weighting each galaxy by the bac - probability that it is one type or another .    for instance , we will study an ` early - type ' sample defined on the basis of hard conservative cuts on two parameters which are available for each galaxy : the value of @xmath3 returned by pymorph when fitting a single sersic profile to the image , and the bac probability @xmath45(e+s0 ) that the object is an early - type .",
    "we require @xmath46 these cuts by no means select all early - type galaxies ; they are simply designed to select a population which is very unlikely to be contaminated by later - types . since our goal is to select objects of a single type , we are willing to sacrifice completeness for purity .",
    "to assess how these bac - based hard - cuts perform , we use the eye - ball classifications of fukugita et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter f07 ) and of nair et al .",
    "( 2010 ; hereafter n10 ) .",
    "these are based on analysis of a much smaller patch of the sdss sky , and a brighter magnitude limit ( e.g. f07 has only @xmath47 objects restricted to @xmath48 ; n10 has about twice as many ) , but for our purposes , the important point is that they are both magnitude limited .    whereas bac classifies galaxies into 4 ( e , s0,sab , scd ) morphological types , f07 use @xmath49t@xmath50 in steps of 0.5 .",
    "to convert , we assign e ( t = 0 and 0.5 ) , s0 ( t = 1 ) , sa ( t = 1.5 and 2 ) , sb ( t = 2.5 and 3 ) , and scd ( t = 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 , and 5.5 ) .",
    "similarly , n10 use the t - type classification ( @xmath51t@xmath50 ) from the modified rc3 classifiers ; we assign e ( t@xmath52 and t@xmath53 ) , s0 ( t@xmath54 , t@xmath55 and t@xmath56 ) , sa ( t@xmath57 , t@xmath58 and t@xmath59 ) , sb ( t@xmath60 and t@xmath61 ) , and scd ( t@xmath62 , t@xmath63 and t@xmath64 ) .",
    ".eyeball morphological classifications from fukugita et al .",
    "we set e ( t = 0 and 0.5 ) , s0 ( t = 1 ) , sa ( t = 1.5 and 2 ) , sb ( t = 2.5 and 3 ) , and scd ( t = 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , 5 , and 5.5 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have repeated this analysis for the late - type sample ( defined by requiring @xmath65 and @xmath45(e+s0 )  @xmath66 ) . although we do not show the corresponding plots here , we again see curvature ( coefficients of fits to equation  [ rlcurved ] are given in tables  [ lrfits ] and  [ msrfits ] ) .",
    "rather , we illustrate this in figure  [ lres ] , which compares the serexp - based @xmath5 relation for our way of selecting early- and late - type samples , with the more traditional cuts on @xmath3 ( larger or smaller than 2.5 ) .",
    "the two ways of selecting the samples lead to very similar results , with the low luminosity early - types having smaller sizes , but defining a steeper relation , so they would cross the @xmath5 relation of late - types at about @xmath67 ( beyond which there are few late - types anyway ) .",
    "we have also selected an intermediate - type population ( i.e. sa / sb ) by requiring @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "notice that this sample defines the same @xmath5 relation as when we require our early - type selection ( i.e. , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , as well as that when we only require @xmath72 ; we return to this in section  [ lrmorph ] .",
    "in addition to the mean @xmath5 relation , the scatter around the mean relation is expected to constrain galaxy formation models ( shen et al . 2003 ; shankar & bernardi 2009 ; shankar et al .",
    "as we show below , our analysis of the mean @xmath5 relation allows us to make two interesting statements about the scatter around it for early - type galaxies : @xmath73 there is intrinsic scatter and @xmath74 it is smaller at the high mass end .",
    "the top two jagged solid curves in the top panel of figure  [ lrscatter ] show the measured scatter around the mean @xmath5 relation for sdss early - types , when @xmath23 and @xmath12 are determined by fits to a single sersic ( larger scatter ) and to a serexp model ( lower scatter ) . this scatter is broader than the intrinsic one , because it includes a contribution from the measurement errors . for comparison ,",
    "the smooth black curve shows the corresponding ( error broadened ) scatter reported by shen et al .",
    "it is in reasonably good agreement with ours , except at the faint end , where we believe the enhanced scatter is due to increased contamination by spirals , for which the scatter is larger ( as we show later ) .    to estimate the intrinsic scatter ,",
    "we must account for the broadening due to measurement errors .",
    "we estimate the errors on the sizes from fitting to the objects in the mock catalogs used in section  [ 2components ] , where we know the input values .",
    "( see meert et al .",
    "2013 for details of how the mocks were generated . )",
    "the dotted and dashed lines show these simulation - based estimates of the measurement error on the sizes for an early - type sample .",
    "the lowest dotted line shows the rms scatter in @xmath26 around the input value if the input profile is a single sersic , and we fit it with a sersic . in this , and all the cases which follow , we show this scatter as a function of the fitted ( as opposed to the input ) absolute magnitude .",
    "the other dotted line , which lies only slightly above the previous one , shows what happens if we fit a serexp with a serexp .",
    "these curves certainly underestimate the full measurement error , since they are based on fits to smooth images , whereas real images may be lumpy , have spiral arms , etc .",
    "to get an idea of the magnitude of such effects , the dot - dashed curve in the top panel of figure  [ lrscatter ] shows the rms difference between pymorph and s11 sizes returned by two - component serexp fits to sdss images , plotted as a function of the pymorph serexp absolute magnitude for the early - type sample .",
    "this is almost certainly an overestimate of the measurement error on the sizes , since it includes systematic effects which arise from the differences between pymorph and s11 ; we have included it just to get a sense of the overall magnitude with which systematic rather than random errors might affect the scatter in the @xmath5 relation .",
    "the two dashed curves show results from using pymorph to fit a sersic with a serexp ( lower ) and a serexp with a sersic ( upper ) .",
    "the differences between these and the dotted curves give an idea of the effect on the scatter of fitting an incorrect model to the data .",
    "the upper dashed curve is particularly interesting , in view of the fact that the serexp model is more realistic ( see section  [ 2components ] ) , whereas the single sersic model is most often fit .",
    "clearly , subtracting it in quadrature from the upper solid curve will lead to negative values at large luminosities .",
    "this is shown by the lower of the two curves in the bottom panel : at @xmath67 or so , the intrinsic scatter is consistent with zero .",
    "this , of course , does _ not _ mean that the @xmath5 relation is intrinsically a line with negligible scatter .",
    "rather , it is entirely a consequence of fitting an incorrect model .",
    "recently , nair et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have used just such an argument to claim that the @xmath5 relation has no scatter . however",
    ", their argument is based on petrosian sizes and luminosities ; these are known to be inaccurate at large @xmath12 , so the analysis above illustrates why their claim should be treated with skepticism .",
    "indeed , the upper curve shows the result of subtracting ( in quadrature ) the upper dotted curve from the lower solid one , since both these are based on fitting to what we argued were more realistic models of the light profile ( i.e. serexp ) . in this case , the intrinsic scatter is well - behaved : although it decreases steadily with @xmath75 , it does not go negative .    of course , since our estimate of the measurement error is really an underestimate , it is still possible that the intrinsic scatter is smaller than we show .",
    "therefore , we turn to what we believe is a much more effective way of showing that there is some intrinsic scatter .",
    "this method studies if the residuals from the relation correlate with other parameters , once correlations between the measurement errors have been accounted for .",
    "if they do , then there must be some intrinsic scatter .",
    "figure  [ lrfixs ] shows the @xmath5 relation for a number of narrow bins in velocity dispersion @xmath76 . at fixed @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath5 relation is a power law whose slope is 0.85 for all @xmath76 but whose zero - point increases as @xmath76 decreases .",
    "the scaling is quite well described by @xmath77 the dependence on @xmath76 shows clearly that the scatter around the mean @xmath5 relation correlates with @xmath76 ; it is not all due to measurement errors .",
    "we are not the first to have made this point ( see bernardi et al .",
    "2003b for an explicit discussion of this , although the long - studied fundamental plane is the result of this correlation ) , so it is surprising that nair et al .",
    "ignored it .",
    "the slope of 0.85 ( at fixed @xmath76 ) is consistent with previous work ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003a ; bernardi 2009 ) .",
    "while steeper than the slope of 0.64 associated with averaging over all @xmath76 , it is less than unity  a fact we return to later , when we discuss the bulges of early - types ( see figure  [ lbrbfixs ] ) .",
    "we end this subsection with the observation that the intrinsic scatter appears to be smallest for the most luminous objects . since it is commonly believed that mergers will affect the scatter of scaling relations such as this one , our overestimate of the intrisic scatter in the @xmath5 relation provides a new constraint on models of how the most massive galaxies must have formed .",
    "e.g. , shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that many minor mergers may be more consistent with the shape and scatter of the @xmath5 relation than are few major mergers . other work has also explored constraints which come from the scatter ( shankar et al .",
    "2012 ) ; it will be interesting to revisit this question in light of the mass - dependence we believe we see .",
    "in the previous section we used a hard cut on the bac probability to determine morphology . since this is not quite in the spirit of why such probabilities were generated in the first place , this section shows the result of using the bac probabilities as weights when determining the @xmath5 scaling relation . as this is one of the first such studies of weight - based scaling relations , and tables  [ f07 ] and  [ n10 ]",

    "the results of fitting equation  ( [ rlcurved ] ) to these curved relations are reported in tables  [ lrfits ] and  [ msrfits ] .",
    "notice that galaxies weighted by @xmath45(sab ) define a relation which lies between that defined by @xmath45(scd ) on the one hand and @xmath45(e ) and @xmath45(s0 ) on the other .",
    "however , the sa / sb class is difficult to define ( c.f .",

    "the cyan curves show fits to these subsamples , and the magenta curves show fits based on the n10 ( eyeball ) classifications .",
    "the two are in quite good agreement .",
    "to emphasize the fact that the relation is different for the different subsamples , the red solid curve , which is the same in each panel , shows the bac - based relation for @xmath45(e ) .",
    "the orange , green and blue curves ( in the relevant panels ) show the bac - based relations for @xmath45(s0 ) , @xmath45(sab ) and @xmath45(scd ) .",
    "these are in good agreement with the f07 and n10 based relations for e and s0 galaxies .",
    "note that f07 and n10 agree that sa s define the same relation as es and s0s , whereas sb s are offset to larger sizes at smaller @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that combining sa s and sb s into a single type may be problematic .",
    "indeed , the bac - based results for sab lie further from that for es compared to those based on f07 and n10 for sa s , but are in good agreement for sb s ; however , for scd s they lie closer to the e relation than do f07 or n10 .",
    "these small but systematic differences between the bac and eye - ball based results suggest that combining sab s into a single class as is done by bac has resulted in a weighted sum of the relations defined by e s and scd s .",
    "figure  [ lrf07 ] shows that the curvature in the @xmath5 relation is such that , for scds , there is almost no correlation at @xmath79 .",
    "this flattening at low luminosities is also evident for the other morphological types , and is more pronounced in the @xmath80 relation shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ lrw ] ( see also figure  [ lrbd ] below ) .",
    "indeed , figure  [ lrw ] shows that at @xmath81 , even the samples weighted by @xmath45(e ) and @xmath45(s0 ) tend to have essentially no correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is the same mass scale at which a number of other early - type galaxy scaling relations change qualitatively ( bernardi et al . 2011a , b and our figure  [ msrserexp ] ) .",
    "since figures  [ lrw ] and  [ lrf07 ] indicate that it also appears to be significant for late - type galaxies , it is interesting to ask if the other , higher mass scale identified by bernardi et al . , @xmath82 , is also significant for late - types .",
    "figure  [ lrw ] shows that , in fact , this higher mass scale seems to set the limit above which there are essentially no late - type galaxies .",
    "figure  [ lrf07 ] tells a consistent story : although there are many es and s0s brighter than @xmath83 , there are no sa , sb or scds with luminosities this large .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "suggested that this mass scale was associated with merger histories that were dominated by major dry mergers ; since such mergers would destroy disks , the fact that we see no late - types above this mass scale is , perhaps , not surprising .",
    "above , we noted that there is essentially one @xmath5 relation for e , s0 and sa galaxies .",
    "however , our sample is large enough to detect small but significant differences within the early - type ( e and s0 ) sample . a closer look at figures  [ lrw ] and  [ lrf07 ] indicates that s0s are slightly smaller than es of the same luminosity .",
    "figure  [ lres0 ] shows that this offset is about 0.06  dex , although it depends slightly on how @xmath23 and @xmath12 were determined .",
    "this is particularly interesting in view of recent work at @xmath84 , based on the s11 reductions , which shows a similar offset of about 15% for the sdss sample growing to @xmath85 at @xmath84 ( huertas - company et al .",
    "both the sign of the trend and its evolution deserve further study , because , as we show below ( see section  [ smallbulges ] and figure  [ l_rdrb ] ) , the sign of the trend is not what one might naively have expected .",
    "one of the virtues of our serexp decompositions is that it allows us to study the scaling laws of disks and bulges .",
    "recall that the second components required to fit bulge dominated galaxies may not be disks .",
    "in addition , although it makes sense to speak of the central component in a disk dominated galaxy , pymorph does not distinguish between central bulges and bars of such galaxies .",
    "therefore , in what follows we would like to contrast the @xmath5 and @xmath80 relations for early - types with those for their bulges , and these relations for late - types with those for their disks .",
    "i.e. , we focus on the change which results from adding a small second component to the dominant one , rather than on the properties of the secondary component .",
    "see gadotti ( 2008 ; 2009 ) and references therein for a discussion of the bars and pseudo - bulges in the centers of disks .",
    "the structural properties of bulges can be reliably estimated only if the effective radius of the bulge is larger than about 80 per cent of the psf hwhm ( gadotti 2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "the sdss psf hwhm is about 0.7 arcsec , and corresponds to about 1.3 kpc at the median redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "on the basis of a nearer - by sample ( @xmath86 ) , gadotti identified that about half of the bulges are smaller than @xmath87  kpc which is the resolution limit of our work at @xmath0 .",
    "this raises the question of how reliable the pymorph estimates are for ( small ) bulges , and if resolution effects will bias our results .",
    "note that in this section we are specifically studying the bulges of bulge - dominated systems while gadotti analyzed bulges for all galaxies with m@xmath88  m@xmath89 , therefore we expect our sample to be dominated by larger bulges .",
    "the reliability of the pymorph bulges was partially addressed in meert et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . but to allow a more direct comparison , figure  [ rbvspsf ] shows the distribution of bulge sizes in units of the psf hwhm for galaxies in the early - type sample we study in this section , in a format which is similar to gadotti ( 2009 ) s figure  7 .",
    "we find a similar fraction of galaxies have bulges below the hwhm in our sample ( 11% vs 10% for gadotti ) and about twice as many galaxies below the 80% mark ( 7% vs 3% for gadotti ) .",
    "these numbers drop to 7% ( below the hwhm ) and 3% ( below the 80% mark ) in our sample if we use the semi - major axis of the bulge rather than the circularized radius .",
    "therefore , reliable estimates of bulge parameters should be possible for the vast majority of our sample .",
    "we have similar fractions to gadotti , despite having a deeper sample , because we are specifically studying the bulges of bulge - dominated systems , and these tend to be the more massive galaxies with larger half light radii",
    ". we will see below that the half - light radii we recover are typically larger than 1  kpc , with no particular feature to indicate problems at around 1  kpc .",
    "nevertheless , we reexamined the results reported below without including the bulges smaller than the hwhm and found no difference in the results .",
    "figure  [ simulationslrbd ] shows a related test of pymorph systematics : serexp fits to noisy serexp images tend to return unbiased estimates of the disks in systems with b / t  @xmath90 , but in objects where b / t  @xmath91 , the estimated bulge luminosities and sizes are slightly too faint and small at the bright end , and a little too bright at the faint end . however , these are rather small effects , so that the following study of the @xmath5 relations of disks and bulges is meaningful .",
    "the top and bottom panels of figure  [ lrbd ] show the relevant @xmath5 and @xmath80 relations .",
    "as we cautioned before , the conversion from @xmath12 to @xmath13 depends on @xmath92 , which in turn depends on stellar population modelling as well as on an assumption about how the imf depends on galaxy mass . but here , there is another reason to be cautious : our @xmath13 estimates assume that @xmath92 for the individual components is the same as that for the total . since we are looking at bulges of early types and disks of late types , this assumption , while crude , should not be wildly wrong ( the same would not be true for , e.g. , the bulges of late types ) .",
    "nevertheless , one might imagine that , as a result , we slightly under(over)-estimate the mass in the bulge(disk ) component .",
    "there are two striking features about late - types and their disks .",
    "first , although the @xmath8 and @xmath93 relations are very curved , they run parallel to the corresponding @xmath5 and @xmath80 relations for late - types ; @xmath94 tends to be 0.1  dex larger than @xmath95 . that @xmath96 is not surprising , since we know that late - type galaxies host small bulges which will contribute to the light at small radii . but that this should have produced a constant offset is not obvious .",
    "we address this question shortly .",
    "second , at @xmath81 , the flattening of the @xmath93 relation with respect to the slope at large @xmath13 is quite pronounced : there is almost no correlation between @xmath94 and @xmath97 at low masses .",
    "this flatness at the faint , low mass end is similar to that for scds ( see figures  [ lrw ] and  [ lrf07 ] and related discussion ) : these disks are far from having constant surface brightness . note that these sizes are significantly larger than the @xmath87  kpc scale below which resolution effects might introduce a bias .",
    "moreover , a flatter relation for disks is also seen in the lower panel of figure  13 in gadotti ( 2009 ) .",
    "the bulges are also interesting .",
    "in contrast to when the total light was used , there is almost no curvature in the relation for bulges which is well approximated by a single power - law : @xmath98 the amplitude of the power law is such that the relation for bulges is approximately the same as for the total at very large luminosities ; as @xmath12 decreases , the @xmath5 relation curves away from the @xmath10 relation , towards larger sizes .",
    "( there is a slight flattening of the relation at sizes smaller than about 1 kpc ; these are the few objects for which the sdss seeing may be becoming problematic . )",
    "the power - law nature of the bulge relation suggests a picture in which the curvature in the early - type @xmath5 relation arises as a consequence of adding a second component .",
    "however , there is an interesting puzzle : recall that figure  [ lrfixs ] shows the @xmath5 relation for a few narrow bins in velocity dispersion .",
    "this relation also has almost no curvature and , remarkably , it runs parallel to the @xmath10 relation ( the @xmath12 dependence of equation  [ rb|lb ] is the same as of equation  [ r|lv ] ) .    to explore this coincidence further , figure  [ lbrbfixs ] shows the analogue of figure  [ lrfixs ] : the @xmath10 for fixed bins in @xmath76 .",
    "we find @xmath99 notice that the size is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "replacing @xmath100 with @xmath101 makes no difference .",
    "i.e. , our serexp bulges exhibit the scaling expected from the virial theorem , although the dependence on @xmath76 is different .",
    "finally , the bottom panel of figure  [ lrbd ] also shows that the @xmath102 relation sits on top of that for early types at the largest masses , suggesting that the second component which contributes somewhat to the light contributes little to the mass .",
    "it is worth noting that this happens at the same mass scale , @xmath82 , which bernardi et al .",
    "( 2011a ) noted was significant for early - types , and above which there appear to be no late - type galaxies ( as is clear from this figure , as well as from figures  [ msrserexp ] , [ lrw ] and  [ lrf07 ] ) .    in this context , it is worth noting that one gets approximately the same steep @xmath102 relation if one combines the ` ellipticals ' and ` classical bulges ' shown in the upper panel of figure  13 in gadotti ( 2009 ) .",
    "( the pseudo - bulges which are also shown in that panel are associated with small b / t  @xmath103 values , so they would not be included in our sample of bulge dominated systems . )",
    "while this is reassuring , gadotti argues that it may better to think of the two populations as being physically distinct .",
    "this may be related to our finding of a small but systematic offset between the relations for ellipticals and s0s ( figure  [ lres0 ] ) . in addition",
    ", our figure  [ lrbd ] shows that the scatter around the mean bulge relation increases at smaller @xmath13 , perhaps indicating that we are indeed combining two populations . on the other hand , at small @xmath13",
    "the sizes are increasingly prone to being biased by the seeing , so this may also be contributing to the increase in scatter .      why are the @xmath5 relations for the disks and bulges so different from those for the total light ?",
    "to address this , we selected a subset of the early - type sample with @xmath104 . figure  [ btrshifts ] shows that there is a strong correlation between @xmath105 and b / t ( at this fixed @xmath75 ) for the early - type sample . if the total is 0.55  mags brighter than the bulge ( b / t@xmath106 ) , then the half - light radius of the total is about 0.35  dex larger than that of the bulge .",
    "a similarly tight correlation is seen for other @xmath75 .",
    "what causes this ?",
    "suppose we start from the power - law @xmath10 relation .",
    "@xmath100 , with a given value of @xmath107 , specifies a total magnitude @xmath108(b / t ) .",
    "if @xmath3 of the bulge is known , and we assume that the second component has an exponential profile , then the half - light radius of the combined profile is fully specified only if we also know @xmath109 ( see appendix  [ btanalytic ] ) .",
    "( recall that , although we use the word disk , we do not mean to imply that the second component is necessarily a disk . ) the curves show the expected relations between @xmath110 and b / t for a devaucouleur bulge with exponential disk for @xmath111 and 6 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "although they are independent of the total luminosity ( appendix  [ btanalytic ] shows why ) , the curves shift upwards slightly if @xmath112 and downwards if @xmath113 .",
    "matching the data indicates that @xmath114 at b / t  @xmath115 ( if @xmath3 is 5 rather than 4 , then @xmath116 ) , suggesting that the correlation is caused by the fact that pymorph uses second components with rather large scale lengths to account for the fact that a sersic bulge is not , by itself , always a good match .    whether or not these large scale lengths are physically reasonable is an open question , but we show in appendix  [ btanalytic ] that these tend to be objects for which the single sersic fit returns large values of @xmath117 ; these extended second components do appear to be necessary to provide a good fit .",
    "indeed , fitting serexp images with a single sersic profile requires large values of @xmath3 if @xmath118b / t@xmath115 ( bottom left panel of figure  [ sersic ] ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ btrshifts ] shows a similar analysis of the late - type sample : @xmath119 as a function of ( 1-b / t ) .",
    "most of the sample has b / t @xmath120 for which @xmath121 differs from zero by @xmath122  dex or less .",
    "although this is in the opposite direction to the shifts for early - types ( as it should be ) , the resulting estimate of @xmath116 is similar .",
    "of course , in this case , we expect @xmath123 , so the value of 4 does not require further explanation .    we can , of course , directly measure the ratio @xmath124 for the objects in our early- and late - type samples .",
    "figure  [ l_rdrb ] shows that this ratio is indeed large , with only a weak dependence on @xmath12 , and a somewhat larger scatter for early - types .",
    "the actual median value , @xmath125 , is slightly smaller than the value we derived from the previous figure on the basis of the idealization that all galaxies were devaucouleur bulges with exponential disks .",
    "hence , we conclude that the differences between the relations shown in figure  [ lrbd ] can be traced to the fact that the bulge component in a galaxy tends to be substantially smaller than the second component .",
    "finally , recall from figure  [ lres0 ] that es appear to be slightly larger than s0s of the same luminosity or mass .",
    "we remade figure  [ l_rdrb ] separately for es and s0s ; although we do not show this , the s0s lie slightly below the es on this plot too .",
    "thus , the small but significant trend shown in figure  [ lres0 ] results from the combined facts that the second component in es is a larger multiple of the bulge size than it is in s0s , and es ( being more bulge - dominated by definition ) have larger bulges anyway .",
    "this strongly suggests that the second component in s0s and es is not a disk , since , if anything , one expects s0s to have larger @xmath109 . while it is tempting to conclude that this second component may be intercluster light , as is almost certainly the case for cds ( oemler 1976 ; schombert et al .",
    "1986 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 )  the larger ratios at lower @xmath12 perhaps indicating that this is more difficult to mask out for low @xmath12 satellites in clusters ",
    "we do not have enough confidence in either our two - component decompositions or our bac classifications to discuss ten percent effects .",
    "nevertheless we do believe this is an interesting question particularly because huertas - company et al .",
    "report that the size difference is more dramatic at @xmath84 , and it is not obvious that the intercluster light hypothesis is even qualitatively consistent with this evolution .      before ending this section ,",
    "figure  [ intscatter ] shows our estimate of the measured and intrinsic scatter around the mean @xmath5 relations defined by bulges and disks , and compares them with corresponding estimates for early - types and late - types .",
    "notice that the measured scatter is substantially smaller around the early - type relation than around any of the others . since we argued earlier that the shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) early - type sample is contaminated by later - types , we believe this explains the difference between their results and ours in figure  [ lrscatter ] . note also that the scatter around the relation for bulges is substantially larger than for the others .",
    "our estimates of the intrinsic scatter ( shown in the bottom panel ) come from subtracting , in quadrature , the measurement errors seen in simulations ( dashed lines ) from the total scatter measured in the data ( corresponding solid lines ) , following the method described in section  [ scatter ] . for this reason",
    ", we are almost certainly overestimating the intrinsic scatter . nevertheless , it is interesting that for late - types , disks and bulges , our estimates indicate that the intrinsic scatter decreases at large luminosities . for early - types",
    "this decrease is less dramatic , with the scatter perhaps even levelling out at large luminosities .",
    "we believe these differences , along with the power - law nature of the bulge @xmath5 relation , will prove to be useful for improving our understanding of how massive galaxies assembled their mass ( e.g. shankar & bernardi 2009 ; shankar et al .",
    "we used our automated image decomposition algorithm pymorph to study the effects of systematics in the size - luminosity relation of galaxies in the sdss main sample ( i.e. at @xmath0 ) which arise from fitting different models to the images .",
    "we argued that when fitting to a serexp profile , pymorph returns more physically reasonable results than does the algorithm of simard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( e.g. figures  [ lrzn ] and  [ lrzr ] and related discussion ) .",
    "we presented a novel diagnostic of whether or not the surface brightness profiles of galaxies are better thought of as having one or two components .",
    "the method works by fitting a number of single and two - component models to the image , and then studying the distribution in the @xmath3-b / t plane defined by the sersic index @xmath3 associated with the single component fit and the ratio b / t of bulge to total light in the two component fit .",
    "the way sdss galaxies populate this plane suggests that they are not single component sersic systems .",
    "rather , their distribution in @xmath3-b / t is more similar to that expected of two - component systems , with a sersic + exponential model faring somewhat better than the traditional devaucouleurs bulge with exponential disk model ( figures  [ sersic ] and  [ sdss ] ) .",
    "i.e. , in bulge dominated systems , allowing @xmath126 provides a significantly improved fit .",
    "indeed , we even find bulges with @xmath112 in the sdss ( figure  [ simlumb ] ) .",
    "our conclusion that the serexp model is preferred is consistent with a recent analysis of the mgc , indicating that at least half of the galaxies at @xmath0 are two component serexp systems ( allen et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "note that we do not conclude that , for relatively noisy datasets such as the sdss , two component models provide statistically better fits : e.g. , meert et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have shown that for a large fraction of our dr7 sample , @xmath127 per degree of freedom is not much better than it is for one component fits .",
    "( e.g. , figure  [ select2 ] shows an example of a galaxy for which the two fits are indistinguishable , but the estimated half - light radii are very different . )",
    "this is in agreement with simard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the sdss , and analyses of , e.g. , the mgc by allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and the gama dataset by kelvin et al .",
    "rather , the point is that the sizes and luminosities returned by the two component serexp model are less biased than those returned by fitting to a single sersic or devaucouleur profile .    for objects brighter than @xmath2 , the commonly adopted procedure  of fitting a single sersic profile to what is really a two - component serexp system",
    " leads to biases ( figures  [ datam ] and  [ datar ] ) .",
    "the half - light radius is increasingly overestimated as @xmath3 of the fitted single component increases ; it is also overestimated around b / t@xmath128 ( figure  [ datamnpbt ] ) . for such objects that are likely to be early - type , but have a significant exponential component , the assumption of a single sersic component is particularly bad . however , the net effect on the size - luminosity relation is small , except for the most luminous tail ( figure  [ lr ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , fitting a realistic model is necessary to obtain sensible estimates of the intrinsic scatter around the mean @xmath5 relation .",
    "having done this , we showed that the scatter in sizes correlates with velocity dispersion ( figure  [ lrfixs ] ) , and the rms scatter decreases at large luminosity ( figure  [ lrscatter ] ) , although for early - types it may level off to a constant value of about 0.1  dex at large luminosities .",
    "this should provide tight constraints on the nature and number of mergers required to assemble the most massive galaxies .",
    "we also studied how the @xmath5 relation depends on galaxy morphology .",
    "our figure  [ lrw ] shows one of the first uses of bayesian classifier - based weights in the estimation of the @xmath5 scaling relation for different morphologies ( e.g. aguerri et al .",
    "we found that , even if we allow for finer bins in morphology , there seem to be only two fundamental @xmath5 relations , both of which are slightly but statistically significantly curved ( figures  [ lres ] , [ lrw ] and  [ lrf07 ] and tables  [ lrfits ] and  [ msrfits ] ) .    of course , a closer inspection does reveal subtle dependences on morphology . amongst early - types ,",
    "s0s tend to be about 0.06  dex smaller than es of the same luminosity ( figure  [ lres0 ] ) .",
    "this difference is smaller than the @xmath85 reported by huertas - company et al .",
    "( 2012 ) at @xmath84 .",
    "we argued that this subtle difference argues against interpretting the second component in serexp fits as a disk .",
    "it is particularly interesting in view of the fact that the two types show very different trends as a function of age ( bernardi et al .",
    "2010 ) , so we expect that it , and its evolution , should yield interesting new constraints on models of how early - type galaxies assembled their stellar mass .",
    "similarly , amongst late - types , faint sbs tend to be @xmath129  dex smaller than scds of the same luminosity , but these differences decrease as luminosity increases .",
    "our two - component fits allowed us to study the @xmath5 relations for the bulges of early - types and disks of late types . although the @xmath5 relations for the total light in early- and late - types are curved ( figure  [ lres ] ) , the relation defined by the bulges in bulge dominated ( typically early - type ) galaxies is remarkably straight : @xmath130 ( figure  [ lrbd ] ) .",
    "the relation for disks of disk - dominated galaxies runs parallel to the @xmath5 relation for late type galaxies , being offset upwards by about 0.1  dex . for disks ,",
    "this curvature is so pronounced that , at the faint , low mass end , there is almost no correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( figures  [ lrf07 ] and  [ lrbd ] ) .",
    "we argued that , both for early and late type galaxies , these differences arise because pymorph uses second - components for which the half light radius is @xmath125 times larger than that of the central bulge ( figures  [ btrshifts ] , [ l_rdrb ] and appendix  [ btanalytic ] ) .",
    "it is not clear if for early - types this is physically reasonable  but extended second components are clearly necessary for the serexp fits ( figures  [ select1 ] and  [ select2 ] ) .    the two mass scales , @xmath6 and @xmath131 , previously identified by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2011a , b ) , are clearly visible in our @xmath5 relations ( e.g. figure  [ msrserexp ] ) . for early - types ,",
    "the former , is , among other things , the mass scale at which galaxies are maximally dense . below this scale",
    "the @xmath80 relation curves upwards with respect to the power law which best describes the full range of @xmath13 ( figures  [ lr ] and  [ lrw ] ) .",
    "bernardi et al . suggest that this is because the disk component becomes more significant at these low masses .",
    "the larger mass scale ( @xmath131 ) is where the @xmath5 relation of early - types curves upwards with respect to the power law which best describes the full range of @xmath13 ( figure  [ msrserexp ] ) .    whether or not these scales are associated with the onset of different physics",
    "is the subject of ongoing debate . e.g.",
    "graham & worley ( 2008 ) have pointed out that curvature in the @xmath5 relation may arise as a consequence of linear @xmath132 and central surface brightness-@xmath12 relations ; the linearity of these would not be suggestive of changing physics along the relation .",
    "our single sersic - based fits do indeed yield pure power laws for these relations , at least for early - types above @xmath133 .",
    "but they are not pure power laws for our serexp reductions , which we believe we have demonstrated are more appropriate .    bernardi et al .",
    "attribute the change at @xmath131 to a change in the assembly histories  to ones in which major dry mergers become important .",
    "so it is interesting that it is at this mass scale that the bulge and total @xmath80 relations become the same , despite being very different at smaller masses ( figure  [ lrbd ] ) .",
    "this is particularly remarkable in light of recent work showing that early - types below this mass scale tend to be fast rotators ( cappellari et al .",
    "it may be that our serexp bulge - disk decompositions of the images are reflecting this change in the kinematics .",
    "although running pymorph on the images in other sdss bands would allow us to determine colors and color gradients of the individual components  perhaps providing further insight  this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our analysis indicates that these same two mass scales are also significant for late - type galaxies . at @xmath134 , the @xmath80 relation for late - types ( and their disks )",
    "flattens significantly ( figures  [ lrw ] , [ lrf07 ] and  [ lrbd ] ) ; and @xmath82 marks the mass scale above which there are almost no late - types ( figures  [ lrf07 ] and  [ lrbd ] ) .",
    "given the large differences between the relation for bulges and that for early - types at smaller masses and luminosities ( figure  [ lrbd ] ) , it is remarkable that the slope of the @xmath5 relation for bulges is essentially the same as that for early - types within a fixed bin in velocity dispersion ( figure  [ lrfixs ] ) .",
    "in fact , at fixed @xmath100 and @xmath76 , the mean size scales as @xmath135 ( figure  [ lbrbfixs ] ) . although the scaling proportional to @xmath100 is consistent with the virial theorem ( if @xmath136 ) , the dependence on @xmath76 is not .",
    "why this should be so is an open question . finally , we find that the scatter around the mean @xmath5 relation decreases as @xmath12 increases ( and similarly for @xmath80 ) , except for early - types , where it may flatten at 0.1  dex ( figure  [ intscatter ] ) .",
    "we expect this to provide a useful probe of how massive galaxies assembled their mass ( e.g. shankar & bernardi 2009 ; shankar et al . 2010 ) .",

    "the main text showed that the @xmath5 relation from single - sersic fits using pymorph is in reasonably good agreement with that based on parameters from simard et al .",
    "however , figure  [ dlrps ] shows that , although the two algorithms return similar sizes and luminosities for objects with @xmath137 ( pymorph is about 0.03  dex smaller and 0.03  mags fainter ) , the pymorph sizes and luminosities are systematically larger at large @xmath138 .",
    "this bias for the biggest galaxies is particularly evident when shown as a function of @xmath139 .",
    "since the @xmath5 relation of the largest galaxies is particularly timely , we would like to determine which reductions are more reliable .",
    "figures  [ lrzn ] and [ lrzr ] show that the s11 reductions indicate substantial recent evolution toward smaller @xmath3 and @xmath23 at fixed @xmath12 especially at larger @xmath12 .",
    "we believe this evolution is unphysical , so conclude that the s11 reductions suffer from systematic biases .",
    "no such evolution is seen in the pymorph reductions , so we use them exclusively in the main text .",

    "note that the curves are independent of luminosity @xmath12 ; therefore @xmath12 dependence only enters if the distribution of @xmath152 and/or b / t depend on @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ btrfixmag ] shows @xmath155 as a function of b / t for the early- ( top ) and late - type ( bottom ) samples defined in the main text for galaxies with @xmath104 ; results are similar at other luminosities .",
    "the curves show the predicted relations ( equation  [ rhbt ] ) for a devaucouleur bulge ( @xmath22 ) with exponential disk .",
    "these depend on the ratio @xmath124 , for which we have chosen 2 , 4 and 6 .",
    "we argue in the main text that , despite the widespread use of the term ` bulge - disk ' decomposition for two - component fits , for bulge dominated galaxies , the ` disk ' component is almost certainly not an inclined disk ; rather , it is an extended second component which is required to fit the outer parts of the profile .",
    "but we call this second component ` disk ' anyway .",
    "the top panel shows a very strong correlation between @xmath155 and b / t ( at this fixed @xmath75 ) for the early - type sample . clearly ,",
    "if 20% of the light is in a disk component , then the size is affected by at least this fraction . the well - known correlation between @xmath12 and b / t , and the fact that early - types span a large range of b / t , means that the bulge and early - type size - luminosity relations can be quite different .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that the half - light radius of the ( second ) disk component is typically more than 3 - 5 times larger than that of the bulge , particularly at b / t@xmath156 .",
    "we argue in the main text that these large values of @xmath157 argue strongly against interpretting the more extended component as a flat exponential disk ( not always viewed edge - on ) .",

    "comparison with the smooth curves indicates that @xmath114 for most of the sample . in this case",
    "we do expect the disks to be substantially larger than the bulges , so the results are sensible .",
    "figure  [ btrshifts ] in the main text shows this same information in a different format , which allows for a more direct understanding of the impact this correlation has on the relations shown in figure  [ lrbd ] . and figure  [ l_rdrb ] in the main text shows that @xmath109 is indeed @xmath160 .    to address the question of large @xmath157 in our early - type sample , particularly at smaller b / t , figures  [ select1 ] and  [ select2 ] show two examples .",
    "the format in both cases is the same : the top left panel shows a @xmath161 arcsec field centered on the object , to get an idea of whether or not the object is in a crowded field .",
    "the top right panel provides a closer look at the object .",
    "the panel just below it shows the best - fit serexp model , and the middle left panel shows residuals from this fit .",

    "bottom right panel shows the associated residuals .",
    "the legend along the left shows the values of many quantities returned by the fits , and other information , such as the bac @xmath45(type ) , for the object .",
    "the object in figure  [ select1 ] , b / t@xmath162 and @xmath163 is very likely to be an elliptical : @xmath45(e)@xmath164 .",
