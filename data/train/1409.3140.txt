    "the lee - more model considers some average ionization state to calculate the electron - ion relaxation time .",
    "this average ionization state is calculated within the tomas - fermi approximation .",

    "is used to calculate the time of collision of electrons with the particular sort of ions , however , no corrections for degeneracy and strong coupling are introduced in paper @xcite . since that the apfelbaum model may be used only for non - degenerate plasma with small non - ideality . at normal density",

    "this is not supported by our results and was discussed previously in connection with the anisimov model . however , already starting from the temperature @xmath201  kk the relaxation time is kept fixed at @xmath198 and , therefore , the thermal conductivity exhibits @xmath202 behavior .",
    "our approximation ( [ eq : l22_approx ] ) in the equilibrium case yields @xmath203 behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the linear growth of the povarnitsyn model is better than the constant behavior . at higher temperatures we see the smooth transition from the metallic drude behavior to the spitzer @xmath204 behavior .",
