    "above but near a superconducting transition , the normal state magnetization decreases due to the presence of evanescent precursor cooper pairs created by the unavoidable thermal agitation.@xcite this effect , called fluctuation - induced diamagnetism ( fd ) , was predicted by schmidt@xcite and schmid@xcite , and first observed by tinkham and coworkers in low-@xmath2 superconductors.@xcite in contrast with most of the other superconducting fluctuation effects , the fd is not only proportional to the density of precursor cooper pairs but also to some extent to their size , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the superconducting coherence length amplitude @xmath3.@xcite this leads to a quite large fd amplitude relative to the normal - state magnetization in both low- and high-@xmath2 superconductors . as a consequence , in addition to its intrinsic importance",
    ", the fd has become a powerful tool to probe the superconducting transition in different materials , and in the last years it has been extensively used in high temperature cuprate superconductors ( htsc).@xcite    in spite of its wide interest , an important aspect of the fluctuation - induced diamagnetism remains still open : the fd anisotropy and its interplay with the nonlocal electrodynamic effects .",
    "in particular , the _ transverse _ fd ( i.e. , with the magnetic field @xmath4 applied parallel to the _ ab _ crystallographic planes ) has not been yet measured in any ( quasi)uniaxial superconductor like , for instance , the layered ones . this is because for this direction , the fd is reduced by a factor @xmath5 with respect to the _ in - plane _ fd ( i.e. , with @xmath4 perpendicular to the _ ab _ planes ) , being @xmath6 and @xmath7 the transverse and in - plane effective masses . just as an example , for optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( one of the less anisotropic htsc ) , @xmath10 50 - 100.@xcite so , the measurement of transverse fluctuation effects constitutes a serious experimental challenge , because the small signal may easily be overcome by extrinsic @xmath2 inhomogeneities , uncertainties in the normal - state background , or by a contribution from the larger in - plane signal coming from misalignments in the applied fields or currents .",
    "the first aim of this article is to present quantitative experimental results on the fd in 2h - nbse@xmath0 single crystals for @xmath4 applied in the two main crystallographic directions .",
    "the moderate uniaxial anisotropy of 2h - nbse@xmath0 ( @xmath11),@xcite together with its accessible critical temperature ( @xmath12 k ) and the possibility of growing large and very homogeneous single crystals , makes this material and excellent candidate to study the fd anisotropy .",
    "in fact , the interest of 2h - nbse@xmath0 to study superconducting fluctuations was early recognized by prober , beasley and schwall ( pbs).@xcite however , in their pioneering work they just measured the in - plane fd and , in addition , they used a very low field amplitude ( @xmath13 mt ) . as a consequence , even for this fd component",
    "it was not possible to separate the intrinsic fd from the effect of extrinsic @xmath2 inhomogeneities or from possible _  unknown effects of the charge density wave \" _",
    "( cdw ) which appears below @xmath14 k in this material ( section vi.b of ref .  ) .    to overcome the difficulties commented above , in our experiments we first use @xmath4 amplitudes ranging from 0.05 t to 5.5 t ( i.e. , up to @xmath15 times the amplitudes used in ref .  ) , which avoid @xmath2-inhomogeneity effects,@xcite and cover both the low- and finite - field fd regimes .",
    "moreover , to obtain the signal - to noise ratio needed to resolve the small transverse fd , we prepared a sample consisting in a stack of six large high - quality 2h - nbse@xmath0 single crystals .",
    "these different experimental improvements allowed us to measure the fd in the two main crystallographic directions , and to disentangle the nonlocal electrodynamic effects from the anisotropy influence .",
    "our results also provide unambiguous answers to the questions opened by pbs.@xcite in particular , we show that the fd is not affected by the cdw state , in agreement with a phenomenological estimate that takes into account the coupling between cdw and superconductivity .",

    "the 2h - nbse@xmath0 single crystals used in this work were grown by the chemical vapor transport method . their crystal structure was confirmed to be in the 2h - phase by x - ray diffraction .",
    "these samples have a platelet geometry ( typically @xmath161 mm thick and @xmath164 mm diameter ) with mirror - like surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the crystals volumes were deduced from their masses and the 2h - nbse@xmath0 theoretical density resulting from the crystallographic parameters ( 6.22 g/@xmath18 ) .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath19 , was measured with a commercial ( quantum design ) squid magnetometer .",
    "most of the measurements were performed on a stack of six single crystals ( glued with a minute amount of ge varnish ) , with a total superconducting volume of 73.7 mm@xmath20 .",
    "as we will see below , this is particularly important for @xmath21 due to the small fd signal .",
    "for the measurements in this direction , the sample orientation was controlled to better than 0.5@xmath22 , which ensured that the fd contribution from the perpendicular direction was negligible ( see below ) .      as a first magnetic characterization of the single crystals stack , in fig .  1 we present the temperature dependence of the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetic susceptibilities , measured with a magnetic field of 0.6 mt applied perpendicular to the crystallographic _ ab _ planes .",
    "these measurements were corrected for demagnetizing effects by using as demagnetizing factor @xmath23 , which is compatible with the stack geometry and gives the expected value of @xmath24 at low temperatures .",
    "the zero - field transition temperature , @xmath25  k , and the transition width , @xmath26  k , were estimated as the maximum and , respectively , the full - width at half - maximum of the @xmath27 vs @xmath28 curve .",
