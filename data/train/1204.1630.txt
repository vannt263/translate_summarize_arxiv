    "recall that a polarization on a complex manifold @xmath3 is and element @xmath13 such that @xmath14 can be represented by a khler form @xmath15 of a khler metric @xmath2 on @xmath3 . in the hope of finding a canonical metric in the polarization e. calabi  @xcite defined a natural riemannian functional on this space of khler metrics .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the space of khler metrics representing the polarization .",
    "calabi proposed that one should seek critical points of the functional @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scalar curvature of @xmath2 and @xmath19 the volume form .",
    "he called the critical points of this functional _ extremal khler metrics _ and showed that @xmath2 is extremal if and only if the gradient of @xmath18 is a real holomorphic vector field .",
    "in particular , a constant scalar curvature metric is extremal , but many examples of extremal metrics are known which are not constant scalar curvature .",
    "an extremal khler metric is of constant scalar curvature if and only if the futaki invariant vanishes  @xcite .",
    "many examples are known of extremal metrics of both constant and nonconstant scalar curvature    one way of producing new examples is to start with a known extremal metric and try to deform the solution as either the khler class or complex structure varies .",
    "this has been done with considerable success by c. lebrun and s. r. simanca  @xcite , where it was shown that there is no obstruction to deforming extremal metrics as the khler class is varied , whereas a nondegeneracy condition on the futaki invariant is sufficient to guarantee that a constant scalar curvature metric can be deformed through extremal metrics as the complex structure is deformed .",
    "the nondegeneracy of the futaki invariant is necessary as deforming the complex structure can result in a reduction of the size of the automorphism group .",
    "later y. rollin , s. r. simanca , and c. tipler  @xcite generalized the later result to the case of equivariant deformations of the complex structure , where the sufficient condition becomes the nondegeneracy of the relative futaki invariant .",
    "this article gives analogous results for sasaki manifolds .",
    "similar results as in  @xcite are proved , although the a polarization of a sasaki manifold is given by a choice of reeb vector field , rather than a khler class .",
    "thus the notions of the sasaki polarization and nondegeneracy of the relative futaki invariant involve varying the reeb vector field .",
    "sasaki geometry sits between two khler geometries . if @xmath20 has is sasaki then the metric cone @xmath21 is khler for some almost complex structure .",
    "furthermore , a sasaki structure is contact and the foliation @xmath0 generated by the reeb vector field @xmath1 is transversely khler , i.e. locally the transversal space to the leaves has a complex structure @xmath22 so that the induced metric @xmath23 is khler .",
    "alternatively , @xmath22 is an integrable almost complex structure on @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the subbundle tangent to the leaves .",
    "so it is not surprising that the notion of extremal metric can be defined analogously for sasaki metrics using the same functional ( [ eq : calabi - funct ] ) defined on the space @xmath26 of metrics arising from sasaki structures with reeb vector field @xmath1 and transversal complex structure @xmath22 .",

    "the goal of this article is to give a similar stability result for sasaki - extremal metrics under equivariant deformations of the transversal complex structure to the reeb foliation .",
