    "the next generation of colliders , and especially the lhc , will boost the search for new physics , and in particular , the supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "therefore , it seems important to derive new constraints on the properties of supersymmetric particles . for this purpose ,",
    "a good strategy would be to look at where the standard model ( sm ) can be subdominant in comparison to the supersymmetry , and where qcd corrections are known with high accuracy and branching fractions can be measured at lhc even at initial low luminosities .",
    "rare b decays appear to be _",
    "ideal choices _ for the above goal .",
    "for example , @xmath1 transitions are forbidden at the tree level in the sm . in this work",
    ", we will concentrate on the related exclusive @xmath0 decay , within supersymmetry , considering msugra parameter space and the minimal flavor violation .",
    "the main focus is on isospin asymmetry which , as we will see later , is a valuable observable to get constraints on supersymmetric parameters .",
    "a more detailed analysis is presented in ref .",
    "the isospin asymmetry for the exclusive process @xmath2 can be defined as : @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be obtained by using the charge conjugate modes .",
    "we consider here recent data for exclusive decays from belle @xcite and babar @xcite : @xmath5 the effective hamiltonian for @xmath6 transitions can be written : @xmath7\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath9 are elements of the ckm matrix , @xmath10 are the operators relevant to @xmath2 and @xmath11 are the corresponding wilson coefficients evaluated at the scale @xmath12 .",
    "the most relevant operators @xmath13 in supersymmetry are : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the projection operators .",
    "+ we consider the wilson coefficients at the next to leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "the contributions from the w boson , the charged higgs and the charginos , as well as the leading @xmath17 corrections to the w boson and the charged higgs are considered .",
    "the contributions from the gluino and neutralino are neglected in our work , as they are known to be negligible in the minimal flavor violating scenario  @xcite . for further details of the calculation of the wilson coefficients ,",
    "please refer to @xcite . following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can write the isospin asymmetry as : @xmath18 the expression for @xmath19 , which is related to the wilson coefficients , can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we generate the susy mass spectrum using isajet-7.74 @xcite and we perform scans in the msugra parameter space ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath17 ) . for any msugra parameter space point , we then calculate the isospin asymmetry , and compare it to the combined experimental limits of eq.([babar ] ) and eq.([belle ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we also perform the calculation of the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath24 following ref .",
    "@xcite and compare to the experimental limits of @xcite .",
    "the points which result in too small light higgs masses ( _ i.e. _ such as @xmath25 gev ) or which do not satisfy the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite are also excluded .",
    "finally , we also test whether the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is charged .",
    "indeed , a charged lsp is cosmologically disfavored if the lsp is stable , but might be viable if r - parity is violated .",
    "we perform scans of the msugra parameter space such that @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 .",
    "+        + an investigation of the @xmath31 plane for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and for @xmath34 , is presented in figure  [ a0 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the area marked `` isospin '' corresponds to the region excluded by the isospin breaking constraints , whereas the area marked `` @xmath24 '' corresponds to the region excluded by the inclusive branching ratio constraints .",
    "the `` excluded '' area corresponds to the case where at least one of the particle masses does not satisfy the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite . and finally , `` charged lsp '' is the cosmologically disfavored region .",
    "the various colors represent the intensity of the isospin asymmetry .",
    "+ we can note here that the isospin symmetry breaking provides stringent constraints on the parameter space .",
    "it is more sensitive to the smaller values of @xmath22 , and one can remark that it also decreases with larger @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , it appears that the constraints from isospin asymmetry are more stringent than the ones from inclusive branching ratio .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ a0 ] concern a fixed value for @xmath17 .",
    "however , the isospin asymmetry increases with @xmath17 and for example , for @xmath35 , we can obtain valuable constraints at @xmath36 .",
    "this behaviour is revealed in fig .",
    "[ tanb ] , where the isospin asymmetry is depicted in function of @xmath17 and @xmath21 for @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note that again , isospin asymmetry reveals to be more restricting than the branching ratio . +     for @xmath38 , with @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
