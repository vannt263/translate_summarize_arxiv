    "spin injection @xcite from a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal into nonmagnetic ( nm ) materials ( metal , semiconductor , insulator ) is very important for device applications and for academic interest .",
    "the operation of the spin valve , a hybrid structure of fm metal / nm / fm metal , depends on efficient spin injection from one fm electrode into the nm layer and spin detection in the other fm electrode .",
    "typical examples of a spin valve include giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) devices @xcite , magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) @xcite , fm / nm / fm nanopillars @xcite , etc .",
    "the magnetoresistance has been enhanced up to a few hundred percent in the recent mgo - based mtjs @xcite and gmr and mtj devices are already in commercial markets for magnetic read heads .",
    "mgo - based mtjs are now being used for magnetic random access memory devices . however",
    ", these _ vertical _ spin valves have some difficulties in integrating them into semiconductor electronics .    in order to integrate spintronic devices into semiconductor electronics , _ lateral _ spin valves are more desirable for , e.g. , multi terminal devices .",
    "due to the increased distance between terminals in lateral spin valves , the spin signal is more suppressed compared to vertical spin valves . furthermore , spin injection and detection experiments in the two terminal geometry of lateral spin valves are complicated and obscured by other effects like the anisotropic mr , the anomalous hall effect , etc . in order to avoid these undesirable effects , a nonlocal spin valve geometry @xcite in which the spin current path is spatially separated from the charge current path , was adopted , and spin injection and detection were clearly demonstrated in al wires @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal spin injection technique was also used to observe @xcite the ( inverse ) spin hall effect in diffusive nonmagnetic metals ( e.g. , pt with a spin diffusion length of 10 nm ) , which are characterized by a rather strong spin - orbit interaction . in these experiments ,",
    "the separation of charge and spin currents , as well as efficient spin injection , is essential to observing the hall voltage induced by the spin current .",
    "if significant magnetoresistance ( mr ) or nonlocal spin signals are to be achieved in lateral spin valves , the spin polarized current should be able to pass through the intervening nonmagnetic layer without losing or degrading too much of its spin polarization in the nm layer or at the fm - nm interface .",
    "nonmagnetic materials with long spin diffusion lengths ( sdls ) are most desirable and are required for successful operation of lateral spin valves . in this respect ,",
    "recent experiments of spin injection into carbon systems , carbon nanotube @xcite and graphene @xcite , are very intriguing . a large spin polarization and a large sdl",
    "are observed in carbon systems . in these experiments , the two voltage probes and thr two current probes were all ferromagnetic in contrast to previous experiments .",
    "motivated by these experiments , we study in this work the spin transport in a nonlocal spin valve geometry with four fm electrodes , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "spin transport in spin valves can be understood theoretically based on the spin drift - diffusion ( sdd ) equations @xcite , which are a reduced version of the spin - dependent boltzmann equation .",
    "the sdd equations were shown to be valid when the mean free path is much less than @xcite or comparable to @xcite the spin diffusion length .",
    "the sdl is the length scale over which electrons can preserve their spin information .",
    "the finite sdl in the samples is caused by the spin - flip scattering due to the spin - orbit interaction , magnetic impurities , etc .",
    "though the sdd equations are phenomenological , they have been very successful in explaining the main features of experiments qualitatively .",
