    "the spectral shape of the far - infrared background ( firb ) detected by _ firas _ at 1004 mm and _ dirbe _ at 140 and 240   ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) indicates a peak at @xmath6  with energy comparable to the optical / uv background .",
    "this peak arises from optical / uv radiation from star formation and agn activity in obscured galaxies at @xmath7 which is absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far - infrared .",
    "this obscured population of galaxies could host approximately half of the massive star formation activity over the history of the universe ( e.g.  blain et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "far - infrared surveys at wavelengths close to the peak of the firb provide a powerful route for understanding the properties of the obscured activity in the distant universe and its relevance to the formation and evolution of both galaxies and super - massive black holes .",
    "the firback ( far - infrared background , dole  2000 ) survey obtained wide - field imaging at 170  with the phot instrument on - board _ iso _ satellite in three separate regions of the sky chosen for low galactic cirrus foreground .",
    "firback is the most reliable and deepest ( @xmath8(170)@xmath9mjy ) infrared census at wavelengths near the peak in the firb .",
    "the firback sources down to 120mjy account for about 10% of the firb seen by cobe at 140240  ( puget et al .",
    "evolutionary models ( dole et al .  2001 , lagache et al .",
    "2002 ) suggest that the sources identified by firback comprise both star - forming galaxies at low redshifts , @xmath10 , and a population of much more luminous galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "the models predict that a quarter of the firback sources should have @xmath11 , with a tail reaching beyond @xmath12 , however this is quite sensitive to the depth and form of the evolution assumed .",
    "the sources in this high - redshift tail provides the strongest constraints on the evolution of the population contributing to the peak of the firb at @xmath13 . for this reason",
    "the identification and study of these galaxies is of particular interest ( sajina et al .",
    "2002 , dennefeld et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the coarse beam of _ iso _ at 170  beam produces large uncertainties in the source positions , ( 100  diameter , 99% error circle ) .",
    "however , using the empirical radio - infrared correlation for star forming galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) , we can exploit deep 1.4-ghz radio data from the vla in c - array configuration ( ciliegi et al .",
    "1999 ) to identify the firback sources with positional uncertainties of only @xmath14 ( @xmath15 vla beamsize ) .",
    "most firback sources lying within the sensitive region of the vla image are detected in the radio ( although some are not and are therefore difficult to identify at other wavelengths ) .",
    "approximately 80% of the firback galaxies with radio ids are detected in shallow sky surveys in the optical ( dposs2 ) or near - ir ( 2mass ) ( dennefeld et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "these 170-  sources correspond to relatively low redshift galaxies .",
    "the remaining 20% of the radio / firback - n1 field population are identified in deep ukirt @xmath16-band imaging at @xmath17 ( sajina et al.2002 ) .",
    "the faint near - ir magnitudes of these galaxies support the existence of a high - redshift tail in the sample and provides an efficient route to identifying high - redshift candidates from the 170-  population .",
    "additional constraints on the redshifts of the distant firback population are provided by submillimeter observations of a subsample of the catalog ( scott et al .",
    "2000 ; sajina et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "scuba photometry observations at 850 , in conjunction with the 170  and 1.4-ghz fluxes , provide photometric redshift estimates ( e.g.  carilli & yun 2000 ) . in this paper we present keck spectroscopy and ukirt near - ir imaging observations of two firback sources , firback  fn1 - 64 and firback  fn1 - 40 , which were detected by scuba in the submm ( scott et al .  2000 )",
    "and whose far - ir / submm / radio properties indicate they potentially lie at @xmath1 , in the high - redshift tail of the firback distribution . our calculations will assume a flat , @xmath18 universe , and h@xmath19=65kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , providing a scale of 8.4kpc per arcsec at @xmath3 ( fn1 - 64 ) and 6.2kpc per arcsec at @xmath4 ( fn1 - 40 ) .",
    "the initial identification of the firback sources involves searching for optical counterparts in the second generation digital palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs2 ) @xmath21-band images ( close to gunn-@xmath22 ) of this region , using the accurate positions of the sources from the radio maps .",
    "this search highlights both fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 as optically faint ( or undetected ) sources , at the @xmath23 limit of dposs2 .",
    "the sources are expected to be at @xmath1 based on photometric redshifts from the fir / submm / radio , and within a degeneracy between t@xmath24 and @xmath25 ( blain 1999 ) .",
    "using the standard carilli & yun ( 2000 ) estimator for radio/850@xmath26 m  gives @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with a 1@xmath8 uncertainty of 0.17 .",
    "aperture matching the observations at different wavelengths ( radio15 , 850@xmath26m19 , 450@xmath26m11 , 170@xmath26m100 ) could introduce errors in such redshift estimates , as well as sed fitting , with confusion problems particularly affecting the 170@xmath26 m  band .",
    "however , the very low source densities in the radio , 850@xmath26 m , 450@xmath26 m   at the firback source flux levels preclude any significant contamination to the beam by interlopers with a very high probability .",
    "by contrast the beams are large enough to include all the flux from high redshift objects . to provide complete , high resolution @xmath16-band identifications for the firback sources",
    "a campaign is underway involving deep near - ir imaging ( chapman et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we observed fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 in the @xmath16-band at ukirt using the fast track imager ( ufti ) as part of the on - going identification campaign of firback sources .",
    "the source positions were taken from the radio / scuba identifications as uncovered in scott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with coordinates listed in the catalog of dole et al .",
    "each source was imaged for a total of 1800s , with individual exposures of 60s each , reaching a limiting magnitude in a @xmath29 diameter aperture of @xmath30 ( 5@xmath8 ) in @xmath31 seeing .",
    "data were reduced using the ukirt software pipeline oracdr ( bridger et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath16-band imaging of both sources is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the precise mapping of the radio source catalog onto the optical grid suggests the astrometric error is dominated by the centroiding of the radio sources themselves ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .",
    "the ukirt observations clearly identify near - ir counterparts at the position of the radio source in both cases .",
    "indeed , we find several near - ir components close to the radio counterpart , on scales of @xmath34 ( @xmath3550kpc at @xmath2 ) .",
    "these components are all resolved in 0.4@xmath36 seeing , confirming they are all galaxies .",
    "based on the available optical limits we find that in both sources the component which is coincident with the radio emission , and by implication is the source of the luminous far - ir emission , is very red , @xmath37 ( table  1 ) .",
    "archival , multi - band data is made publically available through the isaac newton groups wide field camera survey programme .",
    "we extracted @xmath38 band imaging for our firback galaxies , stacking multiple exposures in the same filters with iraf_imcomb_. the imaging has 0.33/pixel , with an average 1.2  fwhm psf .",
    "the calibration zero points were taken from the archive listing for the appropriate observation date ( _ www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath5wfcsur/photom.html_ ) .",
    "1 shows these images scaled to the ukirt frame .",
    "fn1 - 64 displays a striking merger morphology , with components spanning a range in seds .",
    "the strong @xmath16-band j1 component appears only as a faint tail in the optical .",
    "fn1 - 40 is a much fainter optical source , and we have smoothed the image with the psf for display purposes .",
    "some faint emission between j1 ane j2 in the @xmath39,@xmath40 images suggests that this source may also be an interaction between multiple components .",
    "we find that in both sources the component which is coincident with the radio emission , and by implication is the source of the luminous far - ir emission , is very red , @xmath41 ( table  1 ) .",
    "having identified reliable counterparts to the 170-@xmath42 m sources in these two fields we are then in a position to test the prediction that these galaxies should lie at @xmath1 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of firback fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 were taken using the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) on the keckii telescope in 2001 july .",
    "in the echellette mode used here , esi provides complete coverage of the optical waveband from the atmospheric cut - off to the limit of the sensitivity of silicon ccds : 0.321@xmath42 m .",
    "the high spectral resolution of the system , @xmath51 , allows for very good sky subtraction into the atmospheric oh forest at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "the galaxies were acquired and centered on the slit manually using the optical guide camera . in the case of fn1 - 40",
    ", we were able to center on the bright galaxy , j3 ( fig .  1 )",
    ", with the slit aligned to cover j1 , the component identified with the radio emission . for fn1 - 64 , only the optically brighter component of the merging pair , j2 , was aligned on the slit .",
    "the spectral integrations were 1800s for each source .",
    "high signal - to - noise flats and wavelength calibrations were taken shortly before the observations of each target , and fluxes were calibrated using spectra of red standard stars .",
    "the data were reduced with the makee software using the standard reduction recipe outlined in the manual ( blightman 1998 ) . the calibrated spectra for fn1 - 40/j1 and fn1 - 64/j2 ( as well as the acquisition object j3 )",
    "are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the spectra of both fn1 - 40/j1 and fn1 - 64/j2 show a series strong emission lines in the red , we identify the strongest of these as [ oii]3727 , [ oiii]5007 and for fn1 - 40 : h@xmath43 .",
    "based on these identifications we determine a redshift of @xmath4 for fn1 - 40/j1 and @xmath3 for fn1 - 64/j2 . in fn1 - 64/j2 , using a 1800s @xmath44-band observation with the cgs4 spectrograph on ukirt failed to detect a line at the relevant wavelength . ] in addition , we measure a redshift of @xmath45 for the acquisition galaxy , j3 , in the field of fn1 - 40 .",
    "more details of the spectral line strengths from these observations are given in table  1 .",
    "the esi spectroscopic observations provide reliable redshifts for the proposed radio - detected counterparts to the 170-  sources in the fields of fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 .",
    "these redshifts , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , are below those predicted on the basis of the far - ir / submm / radio properties of these galaxies assuming a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for these luminous , dusty galaxies similar to that of arp220 .",
    "we now investigate this discrepency in more detail .",
    "figure  3 depicts the measured near - ir through radio photometry for the two firback galaxies . a template fit from sed library of dale et al .",
    "( 2001,2002 ) is overlayed , encompassing the mid - ir through radio wavelengths .",
    "this template library represents a parametrized sequence of seds ( ordered in terms of their 60/100  restframe flux ratios ) where a range of dust properties ( temperatures and emissivities ) are modelled to provide a composite sed , with increasing far - ir colors for increasing far - ir luminosity .",
    "these seds provide a good representation of all local far - ir luminous galaxies ( dale et al .",
    "2001,2002 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity of the model sed is tied directly to the far - ir luminosity , using the empirical relation from helou et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .    to fit these models to our observations",
    "we simply minimize @xmath46 between the sed and the observations for the radio through far - ir points , ignoring the poor signal to noise 450  point , and weighting each of the points equally . in the case of fn1 - 64 , the dale et al .",
    "templates can not simultaneously fit the radio , 850  and 170  bands to within the 1@xmath8 uncertainties , however the fit lies within the 0.2dex scatter of the fir / radio relation ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) . for reference",
    ", we also show the best fit excluding the 170  point for illustration .",
    "the excellent resulting fit with a slightly cooler template ( lower 60/100 parameter ) to the 450 , 850  and radio points suggests that the large _ iso_/phot beam ( 100  diameter , 99% error circle ) may include an additional far - ir source in addition to the one isolated by the radio and submm . a second radio source with s@xmath47 ( ciliegi et al .",
    "1999 ) lies towards the edge of the firback error circle , and may be contributing to the fir flux .    from our fits",
    "we estimate that galaxies are relatively cool with rest frame 60/100  ratios of 0.43@xmath480.03 and 0.69@xmath480.04 for fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 respectively , where flux errors lead to an uncertainty in the fit 60/100  ratio . as the dale et al .",
    "sed models assume a superposition of black bodies of different temperatures , they can be described best in terms of percentage l@xmath49 contributions from dust at different temperatures : t@xmath50k , @xmath51k , @xmath52k .",
    "fn1 - 40 has respectively 42% , 89% , 100% , while fn1 - 64 has 31% , 78% , 98% .",
    "however , for direct comparison with other galaxies from the literature we also fit a single dust temperature and emissivity ( @xmath53 ) to the submm / far - ir data points and obtain : t@xmath24=25.7@xmath480.4k and @xmath53=1.76@xmath480.01 for fn1 - 40 ; and t@xmath24=30.8@xmath480.7k with @xmath53=1.68@xmath480.02 for fn1 - 64 .",

    "we consider the effects of dust temperature further in subsequent sections .    in terms of bolometric far - ir luminosity ( 40 to 200 ) , using the best fitting seds we estimate that fn1 - 40 has a luminosity of around l@xmath54l@xmath55 , placing it just in the ulirg category .",
    "fn1 - 64 is more luminous , with l@xmath56l@xmath55 , placing it well into the ulirg class and showing that it is four times as luminous as arp220 . in both cases , adopting total infrared luminosities , l@xmath57 , covering all the emission from 31100  in the restframe , we estimate luminosities which are @xmath58 higher than the corresponding l@xmath59 .    we compare in figure  4 the rest frame 60/100 ratios ( corresponding roughly to dust temperature ) and fir luminosities for these firback galaxies with a sub - sample of the _ iras _ bright galaxy sample ( bgs ) with 850@xmath26mmeasurements ( dunne et al",
    "our extrapolation to 60/100 is somewhat model dependent ; while our observed 170  point measures the rest frame 100 , our model fitting gives a variation in the 60  point , dominated by photometric uncertainties ( shown with error bars in fig .  4 ) .",
    "fitting single dust temperature grey - bodies to local _ iras_-selected galaxies using the 850@xmath26 m  point ( dunne et al .",
    "2000 ) has demonstrated the 60/100 ratio alone to slightly overestimate t@xmath24 , with t@xmath24 showing a tighter correlation than 60/100 with l@xmath59 .",
    "this comparison shows that these two firback galaxies are colder than the majority of the _ iras _ bgs given their l@xmath59 .",

    "we discuss the implications of this discovery in section 4 .",
    "the existing optical imaging ( 1.2  fwhm ) reveals an obviously merging , @xmath63 elongated source for fn1 - 64 , and barely detected @xmath64 components for fn1 - 40 , our @xmath31 ukirt imaging at @xmath16-band , however , provides significant morphological information ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 image of fn1 - 64 resolves into a pair of galaxies , with approximately equal @xmath16-band flux , and the complete system has a @xmath65 .",

    "the latter is coincident with the radio emission and by implication is probably generating the bulk of the far - ir output .",
    "the galaxies are separated by @xmath67 which translates into 20kpc at @xmath3 and there is a bridge of emission connecting the two components , suggestive of tidal debris .",
    "fn1 - 40 is a faint galaxy ( @xmath68 ) , with a possible close companion at @xmath69 separation ( j2 ) , and a third optically bright galaxy ( j3 ) lying @xmath70 away from j1 .",
    "the radio centroid is coincident with component j1 , the @xmath16-brightest source with @xmath71 , as labelled in fig .  1 .",

    "has a velocity offset of @xmath72kms@xmath20 from j1 , it can not be considered a part of the system . both j1 and j2 ,",
    "however , show low surface brightness extension ( especially in the @xmath40 and @xmath73 images ) along the axis separating the two components , and we suggest that this probably represents a merging system .    a comparison of the morphologies of these two firback sources , multiple components separated on scales of @xmath74kpc , with local ulirgs ( goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests a similarity with `` early stage mergers '' such as vv114 .",
    "equally , the tendency for the radio emission ( and therefore presumably the far - ir ) to come from the redder component is also shared with local ulirg samples",
    ". however , there are differences : the far - ir curves for fn1 - 40/fn1 - 64 are fit by cool seds , which would normally be accompanied by a modest l@xmath59/l@xmath75 ratio for such early stage mergers ( dale et al .",
    "in contrast , the measured l@xmath59/l@xmath75 ratio , considering both the j1 and j2 components in each case , is large ( 20.7 and 36.2 ) for fn1 - 64 and fn1 - 40 respectively ) .",
    "l@xmath75 is calculated from the integrated flux under a power law fit to restframe wavelengths 0.5@xmath26 m  to 1.5@xmath26 m .",

    "this degeneracy can however be broken using the [ oiii]5007/[nii]6584 ratio ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the metallicity can be used as an indicator of a galaxy s evolutionary state , and as a constraint on possible present - day descendants .",

    "( 2000 ) sample . at both epochs ,",
    "galaxies selected to have the same h@xmath53 luminosities exhibit the same range of @xmath106 and [ oiii]/[oii ] .",
    "we find that the galaxies fn1 - 40/j1 and fn1 - 64/j2 are within our 1@xmath8 error of the median properties of the cfrs sources in the [ oiii]4959 + 5007/[oii]3727 versus r@xmath122 plane .",
    "for the lower redshift fn1 - 40 source , we can use the detected [ nii6584 ] to break the metal degeneracy of the r@xmath122 indicator .",
    "the @xmath1235007/[nii]6584 < 2 $ ] necessitates metallicities @xmath124 , placing the source on the upper branch of the relation , with a metallicity close to the solar value .",
    "while the carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) galaxies in the @xmath125 range are bright star forming galaxies , they fall an order of magnitude below the bolometric luminosity of our two firback sources under study ( several carollo & lilly  2001 galaxies are detected in the cfrs 15  iso sample of flores et al .",
    "while it is therefore interesting to compare r@xmath122 metallicities for these objects , we stress that the @xmath106 indicator has only been calibrated for low obscuration regions , and may not be a valid surrogate for metallicity in the highly obscured environments of ulirgs .",
    "in particular , we are only measuring @xmath106 from regions which happen to be visible from a system which is likely to be generally obscured .",
    "at @xmath2 , sources observed at both 170 and 850@xmath42 m will exhibit similar characteristics as a function of dust temperature ( blain 1999 ) ; the coldest and most dusty galaxies will have the greatest flux densities for an equivalent far - ir luminosity . beyond @xmath126 , the 170@xmath42 m band lies blueward of the peak in the restframe black body and dust temperatures t@xmath127k no longer have significant effects on the observed source flux . a flux - limited survey such as firback is thus expected to be biased towards cooler galaxies at higher redshifts . while we do not yet have the statistics to quantify the actual selection rate",
    ", we note that the identification of the unusually cold ulirgs fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 are in agreement with this prediction : we find cooler galaxies than expected for the @xmath128l@xmath55 bolometric luminosities .",
    "models of the firback population ( dole et al .",
    "2001 ) have evolved the local luminosity function by boosting only the ulirg contribution with redshift , assuming an average sed template for ulirgs .",
    "this scenario is able to fit the firb and the firback counts , inferring that 30% of these sources lie at @xmath121 , and 10% at @xmath129 ( dole et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the assumption that an average ulirg template can represent the firback source population is flawed as it does not take into account the much colder sources which will be preferentially selected at 170  for @xmath2 .",
    "other recent models of the far - ir galaxy population ( franceschini et al .  2001",
    "; chary & elbaz 2001 ) do not incorporate a cold luminous galaxy template and can not directly acount for numerous sources such as fn1 - 40/fn1 - 64 .",
    "revisions to the dole et al .  model ( lagache et al .",
    "2002 ) include a population of colder luminous objects based on the sed shape of the less luminous local firback sources .",
    "the actual redshifts of both fn1 - 40/fn1 - 64 ( @xmath4/@xmath3 ) lie significantly below the @xmath130/@xmath131 predicted from the submm and radio , using the carilli & yun ( 2000 ) estimator ( with 1@xmath8 uncertainty of 0.17 ) which is also derived from the average ulirg sed .",
    "moreover , if the majority of firback sources were to span the range in properties observed in these two galaxies , the average properties deduced from an arp220 template would be severely skewed to higher redshifts .",
    "we chose these two sources for keck follow - up at random from the firback sources where the sub - mm / radio ratio suggested a high ( @xmath1 ) redshift .",
    "as a consequence , the distinct possibility exists that almost none of the radio identified firback sources may lie at @xmath1 , dependent on the mid- and high - redshift distributions in dust temperature .",
    "the measurement of the 850/1.4 ratio for both these sources does allow a constraint on its use as a redshift indicator .",
    "clearly the ratio for these sources must lie significantly above the canonical value for ulirgs found by carilli & yun ( 2000 ) , as shown in fig .  5 . the existence of such cooler luminous sources may affect seriously the interpretation of the high redshift scuba selected population ( see also eales et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "cold yet luminous dusty sources suggest large masses of dust heated at moderate intensity , rather than small amounts of dust in a compact configuration subjected to extremely intense radiation fields .",
    "this latter scenario is clearly supported by the spatial and sed properties of the nearby ulirg arp220 ( soifer et al .",
    "while one could invoke evolving or novel dust properties to explain cooler high - luminosity sources like fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 , there is no evidence to support such unusual dust properties , especially that the seds of both fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 are fitted quite well with the dale et al .",
    "models from the local universe . for objects like fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 however , the data suggest a spatially distributed star formation activity heating a more extended ism .",
    "arp 302 represents a nearby system with a 60/100 color as cold as fn1 - 40 and l@xmath59=5@xmath9710@xmath98l@xmath55 .",
    "lo , gao & gruendl ( 1997 ) have shown that luminous co emission traces the entire optically defined disks of both merging components , covering 23kpc and 11kpc respectively , and we might imagine a similar configuration in fn1 - 40 .",
    "the main difficulty then is to explain the high extinctions suggested by the large infrared - to - visible ratios in these systems .",
    "since we know little of their detailed morphology or geometry , we can not exclude the possibility that the initial conditions and the details of the encounters ( strong tidal interactions rather than direct collisions or mergers ) result in obscured yet distributed rather than strongly concentrated star formation activity .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows how these firback sources compare to other submm luminous sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts . note",
    "that while the firback sources appear to be pure starburst , there are very few spectroscopically identified sub - mm galaxies at high redshift for comparison which do not show agn signatures ( smmj14011 + 0252 at @xmath132  ivison et al .",

    "chapman et al .  2002b , hr10 at @xmath134  dey et al .  1999",
    "both fn1 - 64 and fn1 - 40 appear morphologically similar to the scuba galaxies smmj14011 + 0252 and westphal  mmd11 , having a red @xmath135 source identified to the far - ir emission along with a bluer companion .",
    "this is similar to several local ulirgs ( e.g.  08279 + 1372  surace & sanders 2000 ; goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) , and may suggest that all of these galaxies are generating their far - ir output by similar mechanisms .    as these two sources lie midway between the local _ iras _ population , and the high redshift scuba - selected population ( e.g.  smail et al .",
    "2002 ) , understanding their properties provides a crucial benchmark for continued progress on the evolution of ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 are representative of the optically faint firback sample with radio and scuba detections ( @xmath530%  scott et al .",
    "2000 ) , comprising @xmath58% of the radio identified firback survey . in terms of the bright ( s@xmath136mjy ) , blank field submm sources ( e.g.  smail et al .",
    "2001 , scott et al .",
    "2001 ) in this area on the sky , they would represent only a small fraction of the 850  counts ( @xmath137% ) .",
    "the strong bias to colder dust temperatures in sub - mm and far - ir selected samples occurs because the selection bands fall redward of the grey - body peak . at an observed 170 ,",
    "this implies the cold bias out to @xmath126 discussed earlier .",
    "however , for 850 , this bias is inherent in the entire plausible range of galaxy evolution , out to @xmath138 ( e.g.  blain  1999 ) . in this sense",
    ", the wide field scuba surveys will preferentially uncover the coldest sources for a given luminosity .",
    "we would like to use the existence of these cold , luminous sources to place a constraint on the dust temperature distribution at high redshifts .",
    "if the important driver of the dust temperature is the radiation field then we must compare at similar luminosity systems .",
    "figure  4 suggests that these luminous firback sources are within the coldest 16% of the local population if we cut at the same luminosity .",
    "if we propose that this local population of ir - luminous objects undergoes a strong luminosity evolution of the form @xmath139 out to @xmath140 , we can determine the relative numbers of cold and warm objects isolated by our selection function .",
    "this form of evolution has been shown to match the observe space density of high@xmath119 ulirgs to the local population ( e.g.  blain et al .",
    "1999 ; chapman et al .",
    "2002c ) .",
    "we start with the firback survey limit , s@xmath141mjy .",
    "we add the requirement that s@xmath142/s@xmath143 give @xmath144 @xmath145 , the carilli & yun ( 2000 ) criterion we employed to select high redshift objects for spectroscopic followup with keck .",
    "this selection function implies that we begin to detect objects with t@xmath146k at @xmath147 , and t@xmath148k at @xmath1 .",
    "we find 35% more firback detectable objects with t@xmath146k than with 30k@xmath149k in the accessible volume from @xmath150 to @xmath151 , where we can no longer detect a @xmath152k source .",
    "as our two detected sources have t@xmath24=26k and 32k , our 35% bias towards selecting t@xmath146k sources implies that the outcome of our experiment deviates by less than @xmath153 from the expected outcome .",
    "we can conclude that the dust temperature distribution at higher redshifts is consistent with that observed locally ( or alternatively , that the characteristic temperature of a ulirg does nt increase dramatically out to @xmath126 ) .",
    "note that this is not necessarily the expected result .",
    "for instance , different temperatures distributions for similar luminosity ulirg populations at @xmath154 and @xmath155 could arise due to different geometry of the active region , or different chemical properties of the dust .",
    "complete redshift distributions for the firback population will be required to carefully test the dust temperature distributions at low and high redshift .",
    "a more detailed model , taking acount of the local bivariate luminosity function in l@xmath57 and s@xmath156/s@xmath157 , studies directly the effect of the complete distribution of dust properties on the high redshift far - ir population ( chapman et al .",
    "we have obtained keck spectra and ukirt high spatial resolution near - ir imagery for two of the proposed highest redshift sources from the firback - n1 170  survey .",
    "this survey is currently the most sensitive probe of the properties of dusty galaxies at the peak of the firb .",
    "we find that the redshifts of counterparts to the 170  sources confirm that both sources are ulirgs , but that their redshifts are significantly lower than implied by fitting a typical ulirg sed to their far - ir / submm / radio seds .",
    "this indicates that they have cooler dust temperatures , t@xmath158k , than the canonical ulirg values ( t@xmath159k ) .",
    "the sources both show morphologies suggestive of early stage mergers , similar to recently identified scuba galaxies , and also many local ulirgs .    for fn1 - 40 , we are able to examine optical line diagnostics in the region of far - ir emission .",
    "we measure a large , a@xmath160mag , extinction , indicating a large correction to the h@xmath53 estimated sfr .",
    "the metallicity in this region , as probed by the r@xmath122 and indicator and oiii / nii ratio , is found to be typical for starforming galaxies 2 orders of magnitude less luminous ( close to solar ) .",
    "the detection of these galaxies in the submm by scuba allows a constraint on the 850/1.4 redshift indicator .",
    "we find a relation for these galaxies lying significantly above the relation found by carilli & yun ( 2000 ) , due to their cooler dust temperatures .",
    "the existence of such cooler , but still luminous sources may thus affect the interpretation of the scuba selected population , if they are numerous at high redshift .",
    "recent models of the far - ir galaxy counts , relying on the rapid evolution of a hot ulirg component to the local luminosity function , may predict an erroneous redshift distribution without taking into account sources such as fn1 - 40 and fn1 - 64 .    we have turned the discovery of these two cold , luminous galaxies into an estimate for the dust temperature distribution at @xmath126 for the ulirg population .",
    "we conclude that our 170@xmath26 m , 850@xmath26 m , and 1.4ghz selection function isolates approximately 35% more cold sources ( @xmath161k ) than warmer sources ( @xmath162t@xmath148 ) over the detectable redshift range , under the assumption that the temperature distribution at @xmath154 and @xmath155 is similar .",
    "the relative proportion of the cold population at low / high-@xmath25 can therefore be understood as consistent with the local 60@xmath26m/100@xmath26 m  distribution .",
