    "hints that galaxy interactions might play an important role in inducing multi - wavelength emission enhancement date back at least 40 years .",
    "one of the first quantitative indications came from holmberg ( 1958 ) , as a byproduct of his famous photometric survey of nearby galaxies . by comparing the photographic colors of paired galaxies",
    ", he found a significant correlation between the colors of pair components .",
    "this phenomenon has since been referred to as the `` holmberg effect '' .",
    "although the physical explanation of the holmberg effect is complex , it reflects in part a tendency for similar types of galaxies to form together ( morphological concordance ) , a possible reflection of the role of local environment in determining galaxy morphology , but it can presumably also reflect mutually induced star formation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "during 1999 , a sample of 45 spiral  spiral ( s+s ) binary galaxies was observed at observatorio guillermo haro , cananea , sonora , mxico , as a part of our observational project on binary galaxies selected from the karachentsev catalogue ( 1972 ) . a basic surface photometry analysis of this sample is also presented in this volume ( hernndez toledo & puerari ) . the estimated ( b - v ) colors for ( s+s ) pairs were corrected for both internal and galactic interstellar reddening and subsequently reduced to the rc3 system .",
    "figure 1 shows the ( b - v ) color correlation .",
    "the vertical axis refers to the brighter ( primary ) component and the horizontal axis refers to the fainter ( secondary ) component .",
    "additional information on colors for karachentsev ( s+s ) pairs , mainly from the lyon ",
    "meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) and the catalogue of aperture photometry in ubvri by prugniel & hraudeau ( 1998 ) were included .",
    "demin et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , mrquez & moles ( 1996 ) , and junqueira et al . (",
    "1998 ) also provided some color information .",
    "we can see that the two colors are tightly correlated .",
    "a correlation coefficient @xmath0 is obtained for our ( s+s ) pairs and the additional color information displayed strongly supports this result . a more careful analysis of the ( b - v ) , ( b - r ) and ( b - i ) colors involving stellar population synthesis models is in progress .",
