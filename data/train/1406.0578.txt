    "in this paper , we propose two concepts  the offset angle and the kernel approximability of lpa , and show their roles in the convergence of least - squares projection method .",
    "these concepts come from the wish to understand two counter - examples ( due to seidman seidman1980nonconvergence and du @xcite ) which respectively represent two important cases in which least - squares projection method fails to converge .",
    "let us reformulate the concepts of the offset angles , the kernel approximability , and the strong / weak convergence of least - squares projection method :    * @xmath378 @xmath379:@xmath380 * _ kernel approximability _ : @xmath381 * _ _ strong convergence ( _ _ @xmath382 on @xmath383__)__:@xmath384 * _ _ weak convergence ( _ _ @xmath385 on @xmath383 _ _ ) _ _ : @xmath386    to understand the relevance among the four concepts , we make a table to show the true and false status of these concepts in the several examples we have mentioned ( t for true , f for false).@xmath387    from this table we can see that the conditions kernel approximability  and @xmath388  are two mutually independent important factors of a convergent lpa @xmath28 . in fact , both of them are necessary if we want the convergence of lpa @xmath28 , for we have that ( see remak [ remark3.0 ] ) @xmath389we hope the three are equivalent , if so , the problem of strong / weak convergence of least - squares projection method could be divided into two subproblems , namely , the kernel approximability problem and the offset angle problem .    in this paper , the main result ( theorem [ the1.1 ] ) we get is : if @xmath390 , then @xmath391and when the kernel approximability is valid , for @xmath311 large enough , @xmath392now , we consider the three special cases of @xmath393 , @xmath394 ,  and @xmath395 , then there hold the following interesting corollaries :    * if @xmath393 , then , for any lpa @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath396and for all @xmath247 , @xmath397 * if @xmath41 and @xmath13 is closed , then , for any lpa @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath398 \\sup_{n}\\theta _ { n}<\\frac{\\pi } { 2}\\text{,}\\end{array}\\right.\\]]and when the kernel approximability holds , for @xmath311 large enough , @xmath399 * if @xmath393 and @xmath400 is closed , then for any lpa @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath401and for all @xmath247 , @xmath399here , we remark that : if there are positive constants @xmath402 and @xmath403 such that @xmath404 satisfies@xmath405then @xmath26 has a bounded inverse @xmath406 by lax - milgram theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 13.26 ) ) , and@xmath407    the significance of theorem [ the1.1 ] is partially revealed by its corollaries .",
    "the theorem shows us the clue to choose convergent lpa : first , we need @xmath2 ( @xmath247 ) to guarantee the kernel approximability , which restricts the class of choices for @xmath2 .",
    "then , we choose specific @xmath2 ( @xmath247 ) such that their offset angles @xmath77 are as small as possible , because the small angles can not only guarantee the convergence but also give us faster rate of convergence .",
    "the kernel approximability of lpa is often easy to be satisfied because it is a much weaker condition compared to the condition ( [ eqn1.3 ] ) ( for instance , in the case of @xmath26 being an injection , it is always true ) .",
    "theorem [ the1.0 ] presents several equivalent conditions of kernel approximability , which are : @xmath408these equivalent characterizations of kernel approximability could help us better understand it . from these equivalent characterizations , we can see that the kernel approximability is a weaker version of convergence ( that is also the reason why we name one of its equivalent characterizations as bounded - weak convergence ) .",
    "the interesting points about offset angle and kernel approximability are the geometrical revelations they show .",
    "to be more specific , the offset angle @xmath77 is just the largest canonical angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are subspaces of @xmath409 ; the kernel approximability is defined by the sequence @xmath410 , in which each element @xmath1 is a subspace of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath411 , and the kernel approximability determined by the spaces @xmath412 in @xmath413 , together geometrically depict the convergence of least - squares projection method .",
