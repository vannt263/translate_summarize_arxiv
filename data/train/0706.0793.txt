    "we find repelling solute particle mediated forces between two colloids driven side by side which vanishes to first order in the velocity .",
    "this force as a function of the drift velocity shows a maximum and goes to zero at infinity since the range of the interactions goes to zero in this limit .",
    "the friction on the colloids is enhanced compared to a single one . via the method of images",
    "the same applies to a colloid which is driven parallel to a planar wall , i.e. , it is repelled and its friction is enhanced . when the colloids are driven behind each other , the friction is reduced and to first order in the velocity identical for both colloids . for higher velocities ,",
    "the first colloid feels a larger friction than the second one .",
    "for the behind - each - other case , we find reasonable agreement between the results in bispherical coordinates and the superposition approximation .",
    "for the side - by - side case the agreement is less good .",
    "our explanation is causality . due to",
    "the motion of the colloids , perturbations of the density behind a colloid hardly influence the density around it , but perturbations of the particle density in front of the colloid do influence the density on its surface significantly .",
    "when the colloids are driven behind each other , the first one is almost decoupled from the second one and back - coupling effects between the colloids , which are neglected by the superposition approximation , are less important .",
    "so this approximation works well in this case . for the same reason ,",
    "the first order reflection on the rear colloid already agrees very well with the bispherical results for @xmath72 . for the side - by - side case , back - coupling effects are more important since the colloids are on the same level and the superposition approximation gives worse results .",
    "the flow limited persistence time for one of the solute particles between the two colloids is given by @xmath150 .",
    "for large velocities this time goes to zero and a particle has no time to diffuse from one colloid to the other .",
    "therefore back - coupling effects become negligible .",
    "the consequences of this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1c ] : the superposition - results approach the first order reflection in this limit .    comparing the forces on the two colloids driven through a suspension of ideal brownian particles obtained in bispherical coordinates , with the method of reflections , and in the superposition approximation",
    "we find a qualitative agreement between all three methods in the range in which they can be applied .",
    "all methods are applicable for large distances , however , the superposition approximation yields the wrong prefactor in the asymptotics . for large",
    "@xmath62 the numerical algorithm using bispherical coordinates shows bad convergence but the superposition approximation and the method of reflections show the same qualitative behavior .",
    "in summary we find that the method of reflections is more reliable than the superposition approximation .",
    "the numerical solution using bispherical coordinates has only a restricted range of applicability . in order to further test the method of reflections",
    "a finite element scheme could be used , which would allow for localized refinement of the discretization right at the surface of the forbidden zones .",
    "this would also allow to study the dynamics of the system .",
