    "over the past few decades starbursts , brief intense episodes of massive star formation , have been recognized as important agents of galaxy evolution . however , despite many journal pages per year of attention , there is much we do not know about the inner workings of starbursts . in particular : how long do they last ? estimates in the literature have been obtained from a variety of techniques and range from myr to gyr time scales ( mas - hesse &  kunth &  1999 , and coziol , barth &  demers 1995 ) . _ a priori _ the minimum expected duration is the crossing time : the time it would take for a disturbance to travel from one end of the starburst to the other . local starbursts typically have size scales of @xmath5 kpc and velocity dispersions of @xmath6 km / s , and hence crossing times ranging from @xmath7 myr to @xmath8 myr , with 10 myr being typical .",
    "starburst duration is important for determining the efficiency that metals are released into the igm , and for determining the total number of bursts that a galaxy can undergo .",
    "knowing the duration of starbursts will give us a better understanding about how bursts evolve .",
    "if the durations are similar to  it would suggest that they are self - extinguishing explosions , destroyed by their energy output produced in a non - equilibrium fashion .",
    "conversely , durations much longer than  would indicate that starbursts are sustainable , perhaps even being in equilibrium : i.e.  ism inflow @xmath9 star formation rate ( sfr ) + outflow .",
    "in the mid-1990 s we obtained hst ultraviolet ( uv ) images of starburst galaxies with the _ faint object camera _ imaging at @xmath10  in order to examine the distribution of high mass stars which power starbursts .",
    "the results of our imaging study are given in meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter m95 ) .",
    "the uv structure of starbursts is well exemplified by ngc  3310 and ngc  3690 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "immediately striking are numerous prominent and compact star clusters . however , the total uv emission is dominated by a diffuse distribution of stars .",
    "typically , this amounts to about 80%  of the uv light within starbursts ( m95 ) .",
    "the nearest starbursts in our sample start to resolve into individual high mass stars which trace the diffuse light isophotes , demonstrating that the diffuse light is not a product of scattered light from the clusters , nor is it a figment of the pre - costar optics of hst .",
    "these images reveal that a starburst is not the same thing as a star cluster . nor , is it the sum of multiple clusters .",
    "the natural conclusion is that there are two modes of star formation in starbursts : a very significant 20%  of the star formation is in compact star clusters while the dominant mode is diffuse star formation .",
    "the @xmath3 myr crossing time of starbursts is set by the dimensions of the diffuse light .",
    "it is difficult to verify whether the star formation timescales are consistent with such large crossing times .",
    "broad band photometric indexes are degenerate in terms of population age @xmath11 and duration @xmath12 ( mas - hesse &  kunth 1991 ) .",
    "this is because for extended duration star formation it is the youngest stellar populations that dominate the bolometric output .",
    "hence the light from the onset of the burst has relatively little weight .",
    "the clusters within starbursts are very compact , having effective radii typically of a few pc ( m95 , whitmore et al .",
    "they have velocity dispersions of typically @xmath3 ( ho &  fillipenko , 1996 ; smith &  gallagher , 2000 ) , and hence crossing times less than a myr . since",
    "their photometric ages are usually at least a few myr , they are well mixed systems .",
    "it is fair to assume that they were each formed in a single short duration burst .",
    "if so , one can determine good photometric ages ; since @xmath12 is very small the @xmath13 degeneracy is broken .",
    "this is the basis of our project to measure the the duration of starbursts as a whole using star clusters as chronometers .",
    "the duration of the entire starburst is the width of the cluster @xmath11 distribution .",
    "we have been granted hst time in cycle 6 to measure the starburst duration in four systems .",
    "the sample is listed in table 1 , which lists the distance ( @xmath14 ) , effective radius of the entire starburst ( @xmath15 ) , velocity dispersion , @xmath16 , and crossing time ( @xmath17 ) .",
    ".wfpc2 sample [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     these galaxies were imaged with wfpc2 using the f336w ( @xmath18 ) , f435w ( @xmath19 ) , and f814w ( @xmath20 ) filters . while our own data on tol1924 - 416 has not yet been obtained , stlin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have obtained equivalent data for this system , known in europe as eso 338-ig04 .",
    "three color images of these systems can be found on the web.meurer/research/starburst_dt.html ] most of the rest of this talk will focus on ngc  3310 for which the analysis has progressed the furthest .",
    "ngc  3310 is a nearly face - on spiral with a prominent ring of star formation encircling its mildly active nucleus ( liner or transition spectrum : heckman &  balick 1980 ; pastoriza et al .",
    "1993 ) . in ground based images",
    "the ring is very clumpy , with the brightest clump described as a `` jumbo '' hii region by balick and heckman ( 1981 ) .",
    "ngc  3310 s outer structure is disturbed ( van der kruit &  de bruyn , 1976 ) suggesting that an interaction or merger has triggered the present starburst .",
    "the spectroscopy of pastoriza et al .",
    "( 1993 ) reveals both the wolf - rayet feature at 4686  and the caii triplet , which arises in red supergiants , indicating that star formation has proceeded for @xmath21 10 myr .    the @xmath18 band planetary camera chip image of ngc  3310 s center is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the structures detected from the ground are clearly revealed including the starburst ring and the jumbo hii region .",
    "numerous compact clusters are prominent in these structures .",
    "ngc  3310 is close enough , and the images deep enough that some of the faintest sources are probably individual high - mass stars .",
    "photometry was done on the clusters using daophot .",
    "isolated clusters on the frame were used to construct the `` point spread function '' .",
    "so , it is better described as a `` cluster spread function '' , since the clusters are comparable in size to the pixels , noticeably broadening the psf width ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ; m95 ) .",
    "the clusters were separated from the diffuse light and the photometry was refined in an iterative fashion .",
    "the resulting total and diffuse light images are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a comparison of the two panels clearly shows the dominance of the diffuse light .",
    "the fractional flux of ngc  3310 contributed by the clusters in the different bands is 0.07 ( uv ; m95 ) , 0.092 ( @xmath18 ) , 0.073 ( @xmath19 ) , and 0.065 ( @xmath20 ) . despite the improved optical performance of wfpc2",
    "compared to pre - costar foc , starbursts do not resolve out into an ensemble of star clusters .",
    "the clusters span a wide range of colors , as is apparent in the color composite image presented at the meeting ( see footnote 2 ) . while dust lanes are apparent in the image",
    ", the lack of correlation between cluster color and proximity to the dust lanes shows that dust is not causing the effect .",
    "this can also be seen in the @xmath22 versus @xmath23 two - color diagrams shown in fig .  3 where the clusters form an @xmath24 like locus ; they are not all strung out on a reddening vector .    in fig .",
    "3 the cluster data are compared with starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) single burst models . a range of metallicities and imf parameters were examined .",
    "while none exactly matches the cluster two color diagram ( better models are needed ) , the data matches the general sense of how photometric evolution proceeds .",
    "clusters start out at the lower left ( blue in each color ) and evolve more rapidly in @xmath23 than @xmath22 as the main sequence widens and red evolved stars appear .",
    "after about 30 myr , evolution becomes more rapid in @xmath22 than @xmath23 , tracing the evolution of the main - sequence turn - off .",
    "the reddest clusters in ngc  3310 are on the order of a few hundred myr old .",
    "in contrast to the clusters , the diffuse light spans a vary narrow range of colors .",
    "this agrees well with continuous star formation models .",
    "the model comparison suggest durations range from 5 to 300 myr for the diffuse light , with most of the emission implying @xmath3 to 100 myr durations .",
    "the overall picture is fairly star formation in both the clusters and consistent : the diffuse light has been ongoing for several tens or up to a few hundred myr .",
    "this is several crossing times of the starburst ring .",
    "other researchers have also reported extended star formation durations within starbursts . the work of whitmore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the spectacular merging `` antenna '' system ( ngc  4038/4039 ; discussed in these proceedings by miller , 2000 ) reveals clusters with ages up to @xmath25 myr within the starburst .",
    "this is largely consistent with the merger timescale of 200 myr , and a few times the disk crossing timescale of @xmath26 myr ( barnes 1988 ) .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 2000 ) report clusters in the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy ngc  5253 with photometric and spectroscopic ages up to @xmath0 10 myr , a few times larger than the starburst crossing timescale of @xmath27 myr .",
    "walborn &  blades ( 1997 ) discuss in detail the complex age distribution of stars and star clusters in the nearest external starburst : 30 doradus .",
    "grebel &  chu ( 2000 ) expand on a case in point , reporting an age of 25 myr for hodge 301 , a neighbor of r136a which has an age of 2.5 myr .",
    "the projected turbulent velocity dispersion crossing time between these clusters is @xmath28 myr . clearly even small starbursts have an extended history .",
    "ground based observations of bcds and hii galaxies yield similar results .",
    "their strong emission line spectra indicate that they must contain a substantial young ionizing population",
    ". however , the colors of their starbursts ( determined after carefully subtracting the underlying populations , and correcting for extinction ) , are clearly too red to have been produced by a young ( @xmath29 myr ) instantaneous burst .",
    "instead they are consistent with continuous star formation over @xmath0 10 to 100 myr timescales ( telles &  terlevich 1997 ; marlowe et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this amounts to at least a few crossing times in most starbursts .",
    "contrary claims for relatively short burst durations have been made , particularly with regard to wolf - rayet galaxies ( schaerer , contini , & kunth , 1999 ) and bcds ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) which have star formation durations estimated to be @xmath30 myr 20 myr continuous star formation . ] . in these studies timescales",
    "are often spectroscopically constrained by the presence of wr features , which are washed out for durations @xmath31 myr . however , the spectroscopy can be misleading as suggested by fig .",
    "4 . an observer would usually center the slit on the brightest source within the galaxy , which is likely to be a cluster , and preferably a young one .",
    "such a cluster could dominate the entire spectrum , the majority of the starburst being outside of the slit .",
    "this would give the impression that the whole starburst is dominated by a short duration burst .",
    "cases in point are ngc  5253 ( walsh &  roy , 1987 ; schaerer et al .",
    "1997 ) and ngc  3310 ( pastoriza et al.1993 ) , both of which show wr spectra , but only over a fraction of the starburst .    another strong voice for short burst durations is elmegreen ( 2000 ) who claims that star formation occurs over a timescale of only one or two crossing times , citing various results in the galaxy and lmc .",
    "the difference here may in part be due to the velocity used to calculate the crossing time .",
    "elmegreen uses the sound velocity whereas i have quoted measured velocity dispersions of the ism of the starbursts .",
    "the latter is supersonic , resulting in lower crossing times , and a better representation of the true speed that a disturbance travels within the star forming medium .",
    "if starbursts do last many crossing times there are some important implications .",
    "firstly , starbursts are sustainable , perhaps even self - regulating .",
    "the upper - limit to the effective surface brightness of starbursts reported by meurer et al.(1997 ) and lehnert &  heckman ( 1996 ) is further evidence of this regulation , although it is not clear what the regulating mechanism is . second , burst durations may be longer than the typical ism expansion timescales seen in galactic winds ( martin 1998 ) .",
    "hence , galactic winds are likely to occur in a previously fractured ism .",
    "this should increase the efficiency of metal ejection into the intergalactic medium compared to simulations which usually are modeled in smooth undisturbed media .",
