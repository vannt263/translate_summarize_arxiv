    "at rhic and lhc energies , radiative energy loss is an important mechanism for jet energy loss in the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "it is related to the mean transverse momentum @xmath4 which the parton acquires traversing the plasma .",
    "the momentum broadening of the parton is proportional to the distance it travels , therefore the integrated total energy loss from radiation due to the acceleration is proportional to the distance travelled squared @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss is parametrized by the jet quenching parameter @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quadratic casimir operator of the representation @xmath9 of the parton , and @xmath10 is the strong coupling constant at an appropriate scale .",
    "the jet quenching parameter can be estimated in a dilute plasma perturbatively : @xmath11 the perturbative temperature dependence of @xmath6 is determined by the density of scattering partners @xmath12 and the differential transport coulomb cross section , which is cut off in the infra - red at the debye mass .",
    "a standard nonperturbative calculation of the jet quenching parameter can be done with the help of the dipole formalism  @xcite . in this formalism , a fake dipole of size @xmath13",
    "is constructed from the partons in the @xmath14-amplitude and in the @xmath15-amplitude , the trajectories of which are displaced from each other by the distance @xmath13 .",
    "the transport parameter @xmath16 can then be calculated from the cross section of this fake dipole . in the dipole model , for a dipole of size @xmath13",

    "the trace `` tr '' is normalized by dividing over the trace of the unit matrix @xmath27 in the representation @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , with this definition , @xmath28 . ] . the nonperturbative differential cross section to produce a parton with the transverse momentum @xmath29 is then given by fourier transform @xmath30 the expectation values @xmath31 of the wilson lines have to be evaluated with the target ground states .",

    "the transport parameter can then be obtained by differentiation @xmath32 @xmath33 after a partial integration , one sees that because of the @xmath29-integration only the @xmath34-dependent part , i.e. the first - order term in the dipole cross section is relevant for @xmath29-broadening calculation .",
    "when one takes the expectation value in the medium , the density of scattering partners in the medium enters . one can replace the traced products of wilson lines , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , by two gauge - invariant wilson loops , which facilitates the calculation . for example",

    "other contributions have been discussed in the literature  @xcite . in the calculation , which we will present in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath44-matrix has both real- and imaginary - valued parts , therefore we have to guarantee the reality of the cross section by using the real - valued part of the expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "the real - valued part of the expectation value of the wilson loop in the medium can be related to the transport parameter @xmath6 as follows ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath45    as a tool to obtain the wilson - loop expectation value we will use the so - called stochastic vacuum model ( svm )  @xcite in minkowski space - time .",
    "this model has been applied to high energy hadron - proton and @xmath46-proton scattering  @xcite with two wilson loops representing projectile and target particles .",
    "recently , a single wilson loop near the light cone has also been studied within the svm in ref .",
    "this calculation is tricky since the expectation value of the wilson loop on the light cone is strictly zero in vacuum , the limiting procedure of approaching the light cone , however , can give the quark - antiquark confining interaction in the light - cone hamiltonian .    in fig .",
    "[ one ] we show the arrangement which we use for the following calculation .",
    "the long side of the contour of the wilson loop is directed along the light cone .",
    "the mean @xmath4 is related to the transverse size @xmath47 of the contour .",
    "a counterintuitive property of eq .  ( [ wadj ] ) is its exponential fall - off , since normally an expectation value of a wilson loop in minkowski space - time contains the imaginary unity @xmath48 in the argument of the exponent  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that the exponential fall - off is a consequence of landau damping of soft modes in the quark - gluon plasma and calculate through this mechanism the jet quenching parameter @xmath6 .",
    "recently , a calculation of @xmath6 at strong coupling has been done for @xmath49 sym in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the help of the ads / cft - correspondence .",

    "however , it may be that at lhc - relevant temperatures , the qcd conformal anomaly still plays an important role .",
    "lattice results on @xmath51 indicate that the energy density @xmath52 and the pressure @xmath53 deviate from pure stefan - boltzmann behavior . for this reason",
    ", one may expect a violation of conformal invariance and an explicit dependence of @xmath6 on the gluon condensate , which arises in the svm .",
    "of course , the chromo - electric gluon condensate vanished at high temperatures after deconfinement , but there can remain a chromo - magnetic condensate , and nonvanishing correlations between chromo - magnetic field strengths in the quark - gluon plasma .",
