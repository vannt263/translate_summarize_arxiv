    "the initial coherent state corresponds to @xmath128 .",

    "it was also shown there that the wigner distribution corresponds to @xmath137 , hence a variation of @xmath74 from 0 to 1 looks like a good candidate to create the @xmath31 hybrid formulation between truncated wigner and positive - p .",

    "<S> the difficulty is that the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles or orbitals , while path integral monte carlo is foiled by the rapid appearance of random phases . </S>",

    "<S> however , some interesting problems fall outside the regimes of validity of these , typically where several competing effects are important or there is a transition between regimes that require different approximations . in quantum gases </S>",
    "<S> this occurs with rising density when interactions between the coherent component and incoherent particles already become of essence during the evolution , but the gas is not yet dense enough for the c - field descriptions to describe it with only highly occupied modes . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of c - field methods and their validity ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may occur e.g. in quenches of the gas@xcite , colliding becs@xcite , dynamics of the cooling and trapping , shock waves and the effects of obstacles@xcite or disorder@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this kind of dynamics is often amenable to phase - space approaches that randomly sample the full quantum dynamics , such as positive - p@xcite , stochastic wavefunctions@xcite , and stochastic gauges@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are successful when collective behaviour is important , but interactions between individual particles are not too strong . </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix @xmath1 of the system is re - described in terms of a probability distribution @xmath2 of basis operators @xmath3 that is subsequently randomly sampled . </S>",

    "<S> as in monte - carlo methods , there is no need to follow the amplitudes of all possible configurations as long as one can predict physical quantities with a _ well - controlled uncertainty_. however  and now we come to the central idea to be demonstrated here  this can be taken further : there is also no true need to actually follow the troublesome exact quantum evolution equations provided that one can still predict what they would give _ with a well - controlled uncertainty_.    how can such a roundabout prediction be achieved ? </S>",
    "<S> if one has at one s disposal two , or more , independent approximate methods that produce evolution equations `` @xmath6 '' and `` @xmath7 '' without a noise catastrophe , but which bear sufficient resemblance to the full quantum dynamics equations `` @xmath8 '' , then hybrid equations can be constructed ( possibly ad - hoc ) with a continuous blending parameter @xmath9 in a scheme resembling @xmath10 whose details will be non - universal . here </S>",

    "<S> one extrapolation is not yet very convincing , however , it can be checked using the other independent hybrids @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> conceptually this step is similar to comparing results obtained using different summation techniques in diagrammatic monte - carlo calculations@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the speed of the kicked atoms is supersonic ( sound velocity in the cloud is @xmath22 mm / s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the trap is simultaneously turned off so that the wave - packets collide freely , producing a halo of scattered atom pairs moving at speeds @xmath23 relative to the overall centre of mass . </S>",

    "<S> however , for halo density , it is @xmath78 that is more noisy .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding limits of applicability , at very long times the uncertainty becomes excessive for all hybrids since the short @xmath9 intervals give badly conditioned extrapolations . </S>",
    "<S> hence the bare simulation time in the @xmath8 treatment must not be too small to ensure a sufficiently long @xmath9 interval . </S>",
    "<S> it is also crucial that the blending @xmath9 enter the dynamics in a global way : artificial boundaries@xcite could make observables depend stiffly on the boundary position . for cold gases low densities </S>",
    "<S> can be treated perturbatively , while at high enough densities c - field treatments are valid , so that one expects that the blending method will be most useful at intermediate densities that `` fall through the cracks '' between these two methods . </S>",
    "<S> the relative simplicity of not requiring a projection onto low - energy modes may also make blending appealing in other regimes .    finally , </S>",
    "<S> while the emphasis has been on cold boson dynamics , the general equation - blending approach should be broadly applicable . </S>",
    "<S> for hard - core boson or fermion systems other approximations would have to be hybridised with a different complete phase - space description @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> one can also hybridise `` imaginary - time '' evolution for thermal equilibrium states , or monte - carlo path - integrals with the aim of predicting the ab - initio result for longer @xmath97 than is normally allowed by the fermion sign problem .    _ concluding , _ it has been demonstrated how the full quantum dynamics of a macroscopic interacting 3d system can be calculated for much longer times than was possible with the previously most effective method , the positive - p representation . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative predictions for bec collisions in the dilute stimulated regime were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid dynamical equations used , while not actually simulating complete quantum dynamics _ </S>",
    "<S> per se _ , can be used to confidently predict the full quantum dynamics ( within a given accuracy ) when several families of hybrids are available .    </S>",
