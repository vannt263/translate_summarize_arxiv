    "adiabatic charge pumping occurs in a system subjected to a very slow periodic perturbation . upon the completion of the cycle , the hamiltonian of the system returns to its initial form ; however , the finite charge can be transmitted through a cross - section of the system .",
    "if the hamiltonian depends on only one parameter , which is a strictly periodic function of time @xmath1 , the value of the charge transfer , @xmath2 is zero .",
    "this may be not the case for hamiltonians , which depend on two or more parameters .",
    "the pumped charge may be finite if these parameters follow a closed curve in the parameter space , which encompasses a finite area .",
    "such an evolution may be also characterized by a multivalued variable ( angle ) ; in this case transmitted charge is proportional to the winding number for this variable .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is not universal .",
    "thouless@xcite showed that for certain one dimensional systems with a gap in the excitation spectrum in the thermodynamic limit the charge @xmath2 is quantized .",
    "such quantized charge pumping could be of practical importance as a standard of electric current@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of charge quantization depends on how adiabatic the process is .",
    "the practical attempts of creating a quantized electron pump are based on the phenomenon of coulomb blockade@xcite . in this kind of devices , several single electron transistors ( set )",
    "are connected in series to increase the accuracy of charge quantization .",
    "at least two set s are necessary to obtain a non - zero charge transfer .",
    "semiconductor based quantum dots@xcite are often used now as coulomb blockade devices .",
    "the advantage of these devices is the possibility of changing independently the gate voltage ( and thus the average electron number in the dot ) and the conductance of the quantum point contacts ( qpc s ) separating the dot from the leads . by doing so",
    ", one can traverse from almost classical coulomb blockade to a completely open dot where the effects of the charge quantization are diminished .",
    "it was shown theoretically@xcite , that even weak backscattering in one - channel qpc s leads to almost quantized value of the pumped charge in low temperature limit , @xmath3 .    with the further opening of the qpcs the coulomb blockade type charging effects become negligible@xcite .",
    "in this case , the main contribution to the pumped current is associated with the quantum interference within the quantum dot@xcite .",
    "mechanism related to the inelastic processes was first considered in ref .  .",
    "in open systems , this mechanism , however , is not effective , as the inelastic scattering time @xmath4 can be much larger than the dwell time of the electron in the dot .",
    "in this situation , the main mechanism of pumping is not related to the inelastic processes but rather to change in the phase factors of the corresponding scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "predictions of refs .",
    "were apparently in accord with the recent data of switkes _ et .",
    "al._@xcite .",
    "however , both papers @xcite are devoted to the weak pumping regime , in which the dc current is _ bilinear _ in the pumping amplitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "in the experiments @xcite the pumping was not weak .",
    "our purpose here is to construct a theory of the quantum pumping of a finite amplitude .",
    "the ensemble average of the pumping charge @xmath5 is equal to zero . we demonstrate that the variance of the pumping charge , @xmath0 increases as the square of the area in the parameter space as long as @xmath6 .",
    "with further increase of the area , @xmath0 increases much slower ( as the length of the contour in the parametric space ) .",
    "these results are obtained in sec .",

    "another important problem to clarify is the sensitivity of @xmath2 to applied magnetic field .",
    "zhou _ et .",
    "al._@xcite , claimed the symmetry of the pumped charge , similar to the onsager relation for the conductance@xcite .",
    "the direct consequence of such symmetry is that the variance of of pumped charge is larger in the presence of time reversal symmetry , @xmath7 than in its absence,@xmath8 similarly to the conductance fluctuations@xcite .",
    "both those statements are supported by the experiment of switkes _ et .",

    "the statement about such symmetry is not correct .",
    "we discuss this problem in detail in sec .",

    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) to be valid . usually , defining a perturbation of a quantum system as an adiabatic one means that the frequency @xmath33 of this perturbation is much smaller than the energy of the lowest excitations in this system .",
    "if the system were closed as in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the charge distribution after each period of the perturbation would return to the original distribution , and therefore , the pumped charge would be _ exactly quantized _ in units of the electron charge",
    ".    however , for an open system , the spectrum is continuous , and the aforementioned adiabaticity criterium can be never satisfied . in this case",
    "we the only conditionwe can impose is smallness of the frequency as compared with the temperature and the mean level spacing @xmath34 of the dot separated from the leads .",
    "this condition is not sufficient for the qunatization of the charge .",
    "nevertheless , the value of the pumped charge can be still expressed in the form of the adiabatic curvature ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .    to understand better the relation between closed and open systems ,",

    "level spacing of the whole system @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "we will show now , that the result ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) can be decomposed into two contributions@xcite .",
    "the first contribution is _ quantized _ and is just a charge which is pumped in truly adiabatic situation @xmath37 .",
    "this charge is , therefore , attributed to the dissipationless current .",
    "the second contribution is associated with the creation of the real electron - hole pairs in the system and is _ not quantized_. it takes place in such closed system only provided that @xmath38 .",
    "this contribution involves dissipative conductance and it is due to the fact that the electronic system can not fully adjust itself to the time evolution of the hamiltonian : the state of the system at a given time is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "such retardation of the electrons from the external field leads to the dissipation .",
    "( debye losses in closed systems with @xmath39 gives a good example of such a dissipation ) .",
