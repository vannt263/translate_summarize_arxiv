    "massive mimo has been regarded as one of the key technologies in future wireless networks . in massive mimo cellular systems ,",
    "each bs is equipped with @xmath0 antennas .",
    "this large spatial degree of freedom ( dof ) of massive mimo systems can be exploited to significantly increase the spectrum and energy efficiency @xcite . specifically , there are two important roles for the spatial dof introduced by the massive mimo , namely the _ intra - cell spatial multiplexing _ and the _ inter - cell interference mitigation_. however , there are several practical issues towards achieving the huge performance gain predicted by the theoretical analysis in massive mimo systems .",
    "first , to realize the _",
    "spatial multiplexing gains _ ( combating intra - cell interference ) within each bs using conventional mu - mimo precoding @xcite , real - time csit ( i.e , channel state information at the bs ) is required . in most of the existing works , time - division duplex ( tdd )",
    "is assumed and channel reciprocity can be exploited to obtain csit via uplink pilot training . however , in this paper , we are focusing on a more challenging but important frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) mode of massive mimo . in this case ,",
    "channel reciprocity can not work and the channel estimation has to be obtained via downlink channel estimation and channel feedback , which is practically infeasible because the number of independent pilot symbols available for channel estimation is fundamentally limited by the channel coherence time and it may become much smaller than @xmath1 as @xmath1 grows large .",
    "second , to realize the _",
    "inter - cell interference mitigation gains _ in massive mimo using coordinated beamforming @xcite or cooperative mimo @xcite , _ real - time global csit _ knowledge is required for cooperative mimo and at least partial global csit ( i.e. , each bs needs to know the channels from this bs to all users ) is required for coordinated beamforming . however , the acquisition of ( partial ) global csit is a very challenging problem in practical massive mimo systems because both the downlink pilot training and the uplink csi feedback overhead will become unacceptable as the number of antennas @xmath1 grows large .",
    "it is even more difficult to obtain real - time ( partial ) global csit due to the backhaul signaling latency .    in this paper , we propose a two stage _",
    "subspace constrained precoding _ for massive mimo cellular systems . in practice , due to local scattering effects @xcite , the channel vectors of users are usually concentrated in a subspace with a much smaller dimension than @xmath1 when @xmath1 is large .",
    "the proposed two - stage precoding takes advantage of this limited scattering property to achieve _ intra - cell spatial multiplexing _ and _ inter - cell interference mitigation _ without all the aforementioned practical issues .",
    "specifically , the mimo precoder at each bs is partitioned into an _ inner precoder _ and a semi - unitary _ tx subspace control matrix_. the inner precoder is adaptive to real - time local csit per bs for intra - cell spatial multiplexing gain .",
    "the tx subspace control matrix is adaptive to long - term channel statistics to achieve the best tradeoff between direct link diversity gain and cross link ( inter - cell ) interference mitigation such that the qos of the users is maximized .",
    "such subspace constrained precoding structure simultaneously resolves the aforementioned practical challenges .",
    "for instance , the issue of insufficient pilot symbols for real - time local csi estimation is resolved because the bs only needs to estimate the csi within the subspace determined by the tx subspace control , which is of a much smaller dimension than @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the tx subspace control is adaptive to the long - term channel statistics , which is insensitive to the backhaul latency . as a result ,",
    "the proposed subspace constrained precoding fully exploits the large number of antennas to simultaneously achieve intra - cell spatial multiplexing per bs and inter - cell interference mitigation without an expensive backhaul signaling requirement .

    "we propose a two - stage subspace constrained precoding scheme for massive mimo cellular systems .",
    "the mimo precoder is partitioned into _ inner precoder _ ( for intra - cluster spatial multiplexing gain ) and _",
    "tx subspace control _ matrix ( for inter - cluster interference control ) .",
    "we formulate the tx subspace control as a quality of service ( qos ) optimization problem and propose a novel bi - convex approximation approach to produce efficiently computable bi - convex approximation of this qos optimization problem .",
    "analysis shows that the proposed solution is robust to backhaul signaling latency and can significantly reduce the csi signaling overhead .",
    "moreover , simulations verify that the proposed design achieves significant performance gain compared with various state - of - the - art baselines under various backhaul signaling latency .",
    "note that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 has i.i.d .",
    "complex entries of zero mean and variance @xmath4 .",
    "it can be verified that the inner zf precoder @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 , from which it follows that @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the largest and the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from assumption [ asm : lsfm ] that @xmath11 with probability 1 @xcite , where @xmath12_{k\\in\\mathcal{u}_{n}}^{\\dagger}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{\\left|\\mathcal{u}_{n}\\right|\\times m}$ ] . since @xmath13",
    ", @xmath8 is uniformly bounded with probability 1 . on the other hand , there exists @xmath14 such that , we have @xmath15 uniformly on @xmath1 ; otherwise , it will contradict with the assumption that @xmath16 is feasible .",
    "it follows from the above analysis that @xmath17 is uniformly bounded on @xmath1 with probability 1 . together with assumption [ asm : lsfm ] , @xmath18 is also uniformly bounded on @xmath1 with probability 1",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath52 must also be the optimal solution of @xmath53 with fixed @xmath54 , which is a convex problem w.r.t .",
