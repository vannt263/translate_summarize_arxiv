    "the saturation of @xmath1 at @xmath172.2 has also been found ( e.g. , wrobel et al .",
    "@xcite ; gltekin et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the correlations have been interpreted in various scenarios in literature .",
    "the first type of works is based on the truncated thin disc plus hot accretion flow model ( hereafter abbreviated as the truncated disc model ) , see , e.g. , veledina , vurm & poutanen  ( @xcite ) , sobolewska et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and gardner & done ( @xcite ) . in this model , the thin disc is truncated at a radius which decreases with the increasing accretion rate . inside the truncation radius",
    "there is a hot accretion flow , which may also partially overlap with the disc .",
    "this scenario has been widely adopted in literature as it explains many observational aspects of both bhbs and llagns ( see a recent review by yuan & narayan @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray radiation is from thermal comptonization in the hot accretion flow of some soft seed photons ( e.g. , zdziarski @xcite ; see review by zdziarski & gierliski @xcite ; done , gierlinski & kubota  @xcite )",
    ".    the seed photons can be either the blackbody emitted by the outer disc or synchrotron radiation emitted by the hot flow . in the former case , the flux of soft photons incident on the hot flow increase with increasing the accretion rate , as the outer disc moves closer to the black hole and the overlap with the hot flow increases .",
    "the increasing incident seed photon flux increases the cooling of the hot flow and thus steepens the x - ray spectrum , which results in a positive index - flux correlation ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the increasing accretion rate increases the optical depth of the hot flow , which in turn increases the degree of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "this reduces the soft photon luminosity with respect to the power dissipated in the hot flow , which then hardens the x - ray spectrum , resulting in a negative index - flux correlation .",
    "this indeed has been found in many hot - flow models ( e.g. , esin , mcclintock & narayan @xcite ; veledina et al .",
    "@xcite ; sobolewska et al .",
    "veledina et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see also sobolewska et al .",
    "@xcite and gardner & done @xcite ) propose that the observed change of the correlation sign is due to the above .",
    "note that in the specific model of veledina et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , see also poutanen & veledina  ( @xcite ) for a review , the bulk of synchrotron emission is produced by non - thermal rather than thermal electrons",
    ". such electrons might exist in hot accretion flows ( malzac & belmont  @xcite ; poutanen & vurm  @xcite ; niedwiecki , xie & stepnik @xcite ; niedwiecki , stepnik & xie @xcite ) and then are likely to dominate the synchrotron emission ( wardziski & zdziarski  @xcite ) .    interestingly ,",
    "in the related evaporated - corona model the cold disc within certain radius is totally evaporated into a corona , which thus represents a hot flow .",
    "such corona is indeed dynamically , geometrically and radiatively very similar to an adaf , and its presence can also explain the negative correlation ( qiao & liu @xcite ; qiao et al .",
    "moreover , at high accretion rates the innermost region of the corona collapses to form an inner cold disc close to the black hole ( liu , meyer & meyer - hofmeister @xcite ) .",
    "seed photons from this newly formed disc will increase the cooling of the corona , which will then lead to a positive correlation ( qiao & liu @xcite ; qiao et al .",
    "we note that the inner cold disc here play a very similar role to the cold clumps in our clumpy two - phase model , cf .",
    "section [ theory ] .",
    "a competing scenario for the x - ray production is the standard disc - corona model ( liang & price @xcite ; galeev , rosner & vaiana @xcite ; haardt & maraschi @xcite ; stern et al .",
    "@xcite ; merloni & fabian @xcite ; liu , mineshige & ohsuga @xcite ; schnittman , krolik & noble @xcite ) , where the thin disc extends all the way down to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . in this model ,",
    "the hot corona above the standard thin disc is responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "the disc - corona can naturally explain the positive index - flux correlation ( e.g. cao @xcite ; cao , wu & dong @xcite ; cao & wang @xcite ) , because the fractional dissipation in the corona decreases as the sources brightens .",
    "we note that such interpretation has several shortages .",
    "first , generally disc - corona model can only reproduce a spectrum typical for the soft state ( maybe also soft intermediate state ) of bhbs , where the thermal emission from the cold disc is strong .",
    "second , it can only explain the positive correlation with @xmath18 ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini  @xcite ; stern et al .",
    "third , it can not explain the observed negative correlation .",
    "the presence of the correlation is likely to have implications for our understanding of accretion physics and radiative processes . in this paper ,",
    "our first goal is to construct a sample which is larger than all previous ones and study the correlation between photon index and x - ray luminosity .",
    "our sample includes both bhbs and agns and covers a wide range of luminosity , from extremely sub - eddington to close to eddington .",
    "the second goal is to interpret the correlation based on the truncated thin disc plus hot accretion flow and jet model ( hereafter abbreviated as the accretion - jet model ) .",
    "compared to the previous works based on similar model frameworks , our model is different in the following aspects : ( 1 ) it is based on more precise calculations of the dynamics and radiation of the hot accretion flow .",
    "( 2 ) the jet component is included , which plays an important role on the x - ray emission at low luminosities .",
    "( 3 ) we invoke a new model  a two - phase accretion flow  to explain the correlation of high - luminosity sources . (",
    "4 ) the causes of the scatter of the correlation between individual sources are also studied .",

    "we accept several bhbs which only have reasonable estimates on @xmath20 and/or @xmath19 .",
    "we require that the sources have relatively good observations in the x - ray band so that we can obtain the photon index @xmath1 and the hard x - ray luminosity in the 210 kev band ( @xmath21 hereafter ) .",
    "for some sources which only have luminosities at a specified energy , e.g. , 1 kev , or over different x - ray bands , e.g. , 0.510 kev , we calculate their 210 kev luminosity using @xmath1 .",

    "namely , there is no hard state data for a0620 - 00 , the observation of v404 cyg appears to be not dim enough to show the predicted steepening , and the radio detection to xte j1118 + 480 is only @xmath63 . in conclusion",
    ", further investigations of the nature of the quiescent state of bhbs are highly desired .",
    "below , we describe in some detail the hot accretion flow and the jet model components .      the hot accretion flows include the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi @xcite ) and the luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ; yuan @xcite ) at low and high accretion rate regimes , respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to yuan & narayan ( @xcite ) for a detailed description on the related equations , dynamical structure and radiative properties of hot accretion flows .",
    "we provide only a brief review below .    in adafs ,",
    "most of the energy released from gravitational energy is stored as thermal energy of the gas and advected inwards , thus the flow will become hot and tenuous . correspondingly , synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and compton scattering are the main radiative processes . as the accretion rate increases ( and the system becomes brighter ) , the advection term becomes less important , and it even becomes negative as the flow enters the lhaf regime .",
    "the lhaf is thermally unstable ( yuan @xcite ) .",
    "however , the hot flow can remain relatively stable if the accretion rate is not too high because then the accretion time - scale is shorter than the growth time - scale of thermal instability .",
    "we label this as type i lhaf . when the accretion rate is higher than some critical value , the growth time - scale of the thermal instability is shorter than the accretion time - scale .",
    "consequently , cold dense clumps may be formed in the hot gas ( yuan @xcite ; for similar ideas , see e.g. shapiro , lightman & eardley  @xcite ; guilbert & rees  @xcite ; ferland & rees  @xcite ; celotti , fabian & rees  @xcite ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "@xcite ; kuncic , celotti & rees  @xcite ; krolik  @xcite ) .",
    "we call this a two - phase accretion flow or type ii lhaf . finally , the flow may evolve into a disc - corona structure when the accretion rate is high enough ( see section [ summary ] for more discussions ) .",
    "adafs and type i lhafs , with their dynamics and the radiation well developed ( yuan & narayan @xcite ) , are responsible for the x - ray emission of low and moderate luminosity sources , where the x - ray comes from the comptonization of synchrotron emission in the hot flow .",
    "two - phase accretion flows ( type ii lhafs ) , on the other hand , can explain the x - ray emission of luminous sources , as suggested by yuan & zdziarski ( @xcite ) . in two - phase accretion flows , we expect that , as the total ( cold and hot ) accretion rate increases , the instability grows and a higher fraction of the accreting material will be in the cold phase .",
    "consequently , the thermal emission from cold clumps will become more and more important compared to the synchrotron emission from hot gases , and it will become the dominant seed photon source . due to the complexity of the coupling between the cold and hot phases ,",
    "we follow yuan & zdziarski ( @xcite ) to simplify the calculation of the dynamics of two - phase accretion flow by replacing the electron energy equation with the compton @xmath64-parameter , y = ( 4_e+16_e^2)(+^2 ) , [ eq : ypar ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the electron temperature and @xmath67 is the optical depth in the direction perpendicular to the disc . moreover ,",
    "the compton @xmath64-parameter is expected to be anti - correlated with the accretion rate ( and the x - ray luminosity ; see section [ explanation ] for further discussion on this))-parameter will vary with the radius , here we assume it a constant for simplicity . ] . since our two - phase accretion model is still very crude and the @xmath64  @xmath68 relationship can not be determined from first principles , we arbitrarily assume , y0.7 ( ( r_s)_edd)^-3/4,[eq : yform]where @xmath69 is the eddington accretion rate and @xmath70 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "obviously the slope of the positive correlation ( cf .  the red stars in figs .",
    "[ fig - bhb - theory ] & [ fig - agn - theory ] ) will be affected by this assumption .",
    "the total luminosity of the two - phase accretion flow can then be obtained from the power input to the electrons ( viscous heating to electrons and coulomb electron - ion energy exchange ; for details see xie & yuan @xcite . ) .",
    "we calculate the photon index @xmath1 of the x - ray spectrum through the formulae @xmath71 ( beloborodov @xcite ) .",
    "we use the total luminosity and @xmath1 to derive the x - ray luminosity at a given range of frequency , assuming a simple power - law spectrum with exponential cutoffs at the high and low ends , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is determined by the electron temperature ( as @xmath74 ) at the radius where the emission peaks .",
    "we fix @xmath75 , which roughly corresponds to the temperature of the cold clumps .",
    "we note that the temperature of the cold clumps at a given eddington ratio will likely be higher in bhbs than in agns , @xmath76 if the clump sizes scale with @xmath70 .",
    "our results will be sensitive to the value of @xmath77 if @xmath78 . since we actually only have one calculation for each ( bhb and agn ) subsample ( cf .",
    "section [ general - results ] and figs .  [ fig - bhb - theory]-[fig - agn - theory ] ) , we adopt for simplicity the same @xmath77 for both bhbs and agns .",
    "we note that because of the existence of cold clumps in the innermost region of the accretion flow , the two - phase accretion flow scenario may also be able to explain the possible existence of the dim thermal component and the broad iron @xmath79 line in the bhb hard state ( e.g. , reis , fabian & miller  @xcite ) with no need for a standard thin disc to extend down to the isco ( see liu et al .",

    "@xcite for a similar idea ; but see niedwiecki , xie & stepnik @xcite for the attribution of the thermal component as the small bump in the curved comptonized spectrum of adaf . ) .",
    "however , we have not performed here any quantitative calculations of this effect .",
    "on the other hand , the optical / ultraviolet disc emission is strong and may dominate the bolometric luminosity even when the x - ray spectrum is hard , e.g. , in the case of ngc  4151 ( lubiski et al .",
    "we stress we have not taken such components into account in our modeling .",
    "the main parameters of hot accretion flow include the outflow parameter @xmath80 ( in the form @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 is the radial location ) , the viscous parameter @xmath83 , the magnetic parameter @xmath51 , which describes the ratio of the gas to magnetic pressure , and the electron heating parameter @xmath84 , which describes the fraction of the turbulent dissipation which directly heats electrons .",
    "these parameters have strong effects on the radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow ( xie & yuan @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that if the viscosity @xmath83 is due to the magnetic stress associated with the magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( balbus & hawley @xcite ) , then the values of @xmath83 and @xmath51 are not independent ( blackman , penna & varniere  @xcite ) .",
    "still , we treat here @xmath83 and @xmath51 as two independent parameters .",
    "the physical mechanisms associated with @xmath84 include magnetic reconnection ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace @xcite ; quataert & gruzinov @xcite ; ding , yuan & liang  @xcite ) , dissipation of mhd turbulence ( quataert @xcite ; blackman @xcite ) , and dissipation of pressure anisotropy in a collisionless plasma ( sharma et al .",
    "while it is clear that parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 are both related with the magnetic field , no consensus on their exact values has been reached so far .",
    "this is especially the case for the value of @xmath84 ( for a brief summary see xie & yuan  @xcite ) . from the detailed modelling to the spectrum of various sources ,",
    "the value of @xmath84 was found to range from @xmath85 in the case of sgr a * ( yuan , quataert & narayan @xcite ) to @xmath86 in the case of some llagns ( yu et al .",
    "@xcite ; liu & wu @xcite ) .",
    "this could be due to , e.g. , the configuration of magnetic field in the fuelling plasma in various objects being different .      details of the internal - shock jet model are described in yuan , cui & narayan ( @xcite ) .",
    "the half - opening angle is assumed to be @xmath87 , and the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is set to @xmath88 ( or equivalently the bulk velocity is @xmath89 ) for bhbs and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) for agns .",
    "internal shocks occur in the jet as a result of collisions between shells with different velocities , and a small fraction ( typically @xmath92 ) of the electrons in the jet will be accelerated into a power - law energy distribution with a index @xmath93 . because of the efficient radiative cooling of the most energetic electrons , the distribution of the non - thermal electrons will generally become broken power - law , i.e. the steady - state power - law index for the high - energy electrons ( responsible for the x - ray radiation ) will change into @xmath94 , while the slope for the low - energy electrons ( responsible for the radio - ir radiation ) will remain @xmath93 . in our jet model ,",
    "this change of electron distribution due to radiative cooling is self - consistently calculated .",
    "two additional parameters are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which describe the fractions of the shock energy that go into power - law electrons and the magnetic fields , respectively . with these non - thermal electrons in magnetic fields ,",
    "the dominant radiative process is synchrotron radiation , and inverse compton process is not important .      before providing the quantitative calculations in the next section ,",
    "let us describe the main physics . for the very - low x - ray luminosity regime",
    ", our model predicts that the x - ray comes from the synchrotron emission of the non - thermal electrons in the jet ( yuan & cui @xcite ) . because these electrons suffer strong radiative cooling ( heinz @xcite ; yuan & cui @xcite ; zdziarski , lubiski & sikora  @xcite ) , their power - law index of the steady distribution is @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the photon index of the x - ray spectrum will be = 1+(p_e+1 -1)/2 = 1+p_e/2 .",
    "[ eq : jet - gamma]for a typical value of @xmath98 suggested by relativistic shock acceleration theory ( kirk et al .",

    ". the spectrum will be harder ( smaller @xmath1 ) provided a larger compton @xmath64-parameter , and vise versa .",
    "on the other hand , during the investigation of variability of cyg x-1 , zdziarski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) considered a simple model of a plasma cloud irradiated by soft photons , and the temperature adjusts itself to the energy balance , i.e. for a given power supplied to the electrons @xmath102 , more soft photon power @xmath104 leads to more radiative cooling , lower electron temperature and consequently softer spectrum , and vice versa . since @xmath102 in reality is not likely a constant , we take a generalized version of this result ( see also done , gierliski & kubota @xcite ) , namely the photon index @xmath1 positively correlates with @xmath105 . below we will apply this to understand the observed negative - positive @xmath1  @xmath97 correlation parts . before that , we emphasise two key factors of our hot accretion flow model .",
    "first , unless the density is extremely low , the electrons will emit most of the power they received , i.e. the electrons themselves are radiatively efficient , and the total luminosity can be approximated to be @xmath102 ( verified in both adaf and type i lhaf , while speculated in two - phase accretion flow .",
    "xie & yuan @xcite ) .",
    "second , the origin of seed photons supplied for compton scattering are different in one - phase hot accretion flows ( either adafs or type i lhafs ) and the two - phase accretion flows , i.e. the former is self - absorbed synchrotron from hot gas while the latter is mainly thermal emission from cold clumps .    in the moderate x - ray luminosity regime , a negative @xmath1-@xmath97 correlation is observed .",
    "we interpret it as a hot accretion flow being an adaf or a type i lhaf . as the accretion rate increases ( @xmath102 also increases ) , both the electron density and the magnetic strength increase , which lead to an enhanced increase in synchrotron absorption depth .",
    "correspondingly , the seed photon power @xmath104 will increase much slower ( compared to @xmath102 ) due to the enhanced degree of synchrotron self - absorption , i.e. @xmath105 is negatively correlated with @xmath102 . in other words , from the arguments by zdziarski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we will observe a negative correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath102 ( or equivalently @xmath97 ) for an adaf / type i lhaf system .",
    "then in the bright x - ray luminosity regime , we believe it is the two - phase accretion flow , where it is believed that the fraction of accreting material in cold phase increases with the accretion rate .",
    "we thus have the seed photon power @xmath104 increasing faster than the power supplied to the hot electrons @xmath102 ( opposite to the case in the adaf and type i lhaf ) , i.e. @xmath105 is positively correlated with @xmath102 . applying the analysis of zdziarski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we find that the two - phase accretion model has a positive correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath97 , as observed at the high x - ray luminosity branch .",
    "we note that the origin of seed photons are different in alternative scenarios , i.e. they can be from the inner small cold disc in the disc ",
    "corona model ( qiao & liu @xcite ; qiao et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or from the outer cold disc in the truncated disc model ( veledina et al .  @xcite ; sobolewska et al .",

    "the reason for such a `` bump '' is as follows . at such low accretion rates ,",

    "in this case , the simple analysis in section [ explanation ] fails .",
    "the positive correlation in the range of @xmath136 corresponds to the rising part of the bump . due to the difference of black hole masses ,",
    "the 210 kev radiation is dominated by the first and second compton scattering bumps for bhbs and agns respectively .",

    "this in turn results in a softer spectrum since optical depth is small . secondly",
    ", at the luminous type i lhaf end , due to the strong compensation of the coulomb interaction energy exchange , the radiative efficiency of type i lhaf is insensitive to @xmath84 ( xie & yuan @xcite ) , which implies that the value of @xmath1 is almost the same for different sources with different @xmath84 .",
    "as discussed in section [ hotaccretion ] , the difference of @xmath84 may be a result of the differences in the configuration and/or strength of magnetic field in the accretion flow .",
    "hysteresis behaviour could also be a reason for the different correlation slope .",
    "there is no cold disc initially during the rising , hard - state phase of an outburst , while during the declining phase of the outbursts the transition from the soft to the hard state begins with the cold disc extending all the way to the innermost stable circular orbit .",

    "the red dashed line shows the theoretical modelling result , with @xmath152 and @xmath151.,width=340 ]",
    "in this work , we have combined the data of bhbs and agns from literature to construct the largest sample so far to investigate the correlation between the x - ray photon index @xmath1 and the 210 kev x - ray luminosity ( in eddington unit ; @xmath97 ) .",
    "the @xmath97 in our sample ranges from @xmath153 to @xmath154 , much larger than all previous investigations .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of a correlation between these two quantities , although the correlation has substantial intrinsic scatter ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - bhb - sample ] and [ fig - agn - sample ] for the correlation in bhb and agn samples , respectively ) .",
    "more specifically , the correlation consists of three parts , which can be naturally interpreted in the framework of a coupled hot accretion flow plus jet model . here",
    "the hot accretion flow includes the `` purely '' hot flow with low accretion rates and two - phase accretion flow with high accretion rates . as summarized schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic - diagram ] , our main results are as follows .    * * jet * in the extremely low luminosity range , i.e. , @xmath43 , the value of @xmath1 is constant .",
    "this is because our model predicts that in this luminosity regime the x - ray emission should be dominated by jet .",
    "the photon index is thus determined by the energy distribution of the power - law electrons in the jet , a distribution which is roughly the same for different sources and different @xmath3 .",
    "the observed @xmath99 is consistent with synchrotron emission from radiatively cooled power - law electrons , with an injected energy distribution @xmath117 , a value suggested from relativistic shock acceleration theory .",
    "* * adaf+type i lhaf * in the moderate luminosity range , i.e. , @xmath56 , a negative correlation is observed . in our model",
    "the x - ray radiation in this luminosity regime comes from the one - phase hot accretion flow .",
    "the self - absorbed synchrotron emission provides the seed photons for the compton scattering .",
    "we note that a bump exists in the predicted correlation , mainly because of the appearance of `` compton bumps '' in the spectrum when the accretion rate is small .",
    "only a tentative sign of this bump exists in the observational data and better data is required to examine this prediction .",
    "we note that these bumps may become less obvious for the presence of non - thermal electrons in hot accretion flows . *",
    "* two - phase accretion flow * in the high luminosity range , i.e. , @xmath41 , a positive correlation is observed . in our picture",
    "the accretion flow in this regime will be in two - phase .",
    "the compton up - scattering of the optical / ultraviolet radiation from the cold clumps will highly cool the electrons in the hot phase . if our assumption of the anti - relationship between compton @xmath64 parameter and @xmath68 is reasonable ( cf .",
    "sections  [ hotaccretion ] & [ explanation ] ) , a positive relationship will then be expected . *",
    "the correlation has a large scatter .",
    "we argue that one important reason is that the model parameter , likely @xmath84 , is different for different sources .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the correlation of each individual sources is much tighter , while the correlation slope is different from source to source .",
    "we have confirmed this speculation by interpreting the correlation of individual sources based on this idea .     versus the 210 kev luminosity ratio @xmath97 .",
    "labels with the same color mark the key component in the ( hot ) accretion  jet model that is responsible for the correlation.,width=302 ]      some simplifications are adopted in our calculations .",
    "one is the neglect of the non - thermal electrons in the hot accretion flow , whose existence is still difficult to constrain ( for the impact of non - thermal electrons , see e.g. malzac & belmont  @xcite ; poutanen & vurm  @xcite ; veledina et al .",
    "@xcite ; poutanen & veledina @xcite ; niedwiecki , xie & stepnik @xcite ; niedwiecki , stepnik & xie @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , our model is non - relativistic , and a pseudo - newtonian potential is adopted .",
    "moreover , global compton scattering , which is important for bright sources ( yuan , xie & ostriker @xcite ; xie et al .",
    "@xcite ; niedwiecki , xie & zdziarski @xcite , and references therein ) , is not taken into account for simplicity . using a full general relativistic ( in both dynamics and radiation ) adaf model with global compton scattering , the negative @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath97 correlation is investigated extensively by niedwiecki , xie & stepnik ( @xcite ) .",
    "our agn sample excludes those high - redshift ( @xmath155 ) sources whose black hole masses are constrained through civ - based reverberation mapping method .",
    "most of these sources have x - ray luminosities larger than @xmath156 while a negative correlation is observed ( kelly et al .  @xcite ; but see risaliti , young & elvis  @xcite for a smaller civ - determined-@xmath20 agn sample ) .",
    "this is quite different from other sources investigated here , whose black hole masses are constrained through @xmath52emission line ( note that sources whose black hole masses are constrained through mgii emission line show similar results as those through @xmath52line ) .",
    "it is unclear whether this is because the estimation of the black hole mass by civ line is problematic .    in this work ,",
    "we only focus on sub - eddington sources , i.e. @xmath157 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a positive correlation similar to that shown by equation [ eq : pos - corr - agn ] seems to exist for super - eddington agns as well ( e.g. , bian @xcite ) .",
    "this may imply that the disc ",
    "corona model may also work for those sources .",
    "detailed discussions are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "a widely discussed scenario in the literature for the origin of x - ray emission of luminous sources is the `` disc - corona '' model , i.e. , a hot corona sandwiching a thin disc ( e.g. , liang & price @xcite ; galeev , rosner & vaiana @xcite ; haardt & maraschi @xcite ; merloni & fabian @xcite ; liu , mineshige & ohsuga @xcite ; cao @xcite ; schnittman , krolik & noble @xcite ) .",
    "what is the relation between this scenario and the two - phase accretion scenario adopted in the present work ? in our understanding , the two - phase accretion scenario includes this disc - corona model but is more general in the following sense . with the increase of mass accretion rate , as we have mentioned in section [ hotaccretion ] ,",
    "some cold dense clumps will be formed , embedding in the hot phase . when the mass accretion rate is not very large , the cold clumps are in the state of individual clouds and are suspending in the hot gas .",
    "we call this accretion flow `` clumpy '' . with the further increase of accretion rate ,",
    "more and more clumps are condensed out and they will gradually merge together and settle down to form a thin disc in the equatorial plane , with hot plasma sandwiching the thin disc . this is the usual disc - corona model .    in our model , the positive correlation ( i.e. , the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic - diagram ] ) is explained by the two - phase accretion flow model ( type - ii lhaf ) .",
    "another possibility proposed in previous works is the disc - corona model , i.e. , the two - phase accretion flow with high accretion rates ( e.g. , cao & wang @xcite ) .",
    "we argue that the disc - corona model may not be able to explain the correlation when @xmath158 , i.e. , the low - luminosity part of the red line close to the turning point , but only the high - luminosity part at @xmath159 .",
    "the photon index at the low - luminosity part is small ,",
    "i.e. , the spectrum is hard .",
    "but for the disc - corona model , since there are abundant soft photons emitted from the thin disc , the predicted x - ray spectrum is usually very soft , i.e. @xmath160 ( e.g. haardt & maraschi @xcite ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini  @xcite ; stern et al .",
    "@xcite and recently cao @xcite ) ) in the 210  @xmath161 band , cf .",
    "their fig . 12 . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig - bhb - sample ] and [ fig - agn - sample ] that there are many sources with @xmath162 in this positive correlation branch . as we have shown in section [ results ] , the `` clumpy '' two - phase accretion flow model adopted in the present work can well explain this part .",
    "another argument against the disc - corona model as the interpretation of the positive correlation will be described in the next subsection ( section [ luminous - agns ] ) .",
    "in addition to the problem of the spectral fitting , another argument against the disc - corona model as an explanation of the overall positive correlation comes from the geometry of the accretion flow . for bhbs , all of the data points in the positive correlation branch ( cf",
    ".  section [ bhbs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - bhb - sample ] ) come from the intermediate ( and bright hard ) state .",
    "as we know , many observational and theoretical works have shown that for the hard and intermediate states the thin disc must be truncated at a certain radius ( for bhbs , see tamura et al .",
    "@xcite ; yamada et al .",
    "@xcite ; hori et al .",
    "@xcite ; see yuan & narayan @xcite for more evidence ) .",
    "this precludes the disc - corona model as the sole model of the positive correlation of bhb sample since in this model the thin disc extends to the isco without truncation .",
    "for the agn sample , the positive correlation consists of data from luminous agns such as quasars . compared to the bhb sample , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig - agn - sample ] that the `` turning point '' is also at @xmath163 , but the luminosity extends to higher values , @xmath164 .",
    "so we speculate that the disc - corona model may be the correct model to interpret the part of correlation beyond @xmath165 , where the spectrum is rather soft with photon index @xmath18 .",
    "we also note that , when @xmath164 , the bhbs will generally be in the soft state , a situation disc - corona model likely operates . for observations in the soft ( and brighter ) state , a positive correlation in @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath97 is also found , like the case of bright agns .    in summary , the two - phase accretion flow model , including the clumpy hot accretion flow model at relatively lower accretion rates and the disc - corona model at higher accretion rates , can explain the luminous agns .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained in yuan & zdziarski ( @xcite ) .",
    "the clumpy and the disc - corona models are responsible for the x - ray origin of agns with @xmath166 and @xmath164 respectively .",
