    "nonlinear dispersive waves in physical systems are often described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , which is both mathematically and physically studied in a broad range of settings including atomic physics  @xcite , nonlinear optics  @xcite and mathematical physics  @xcite . both the continuum and the discrete  @xcite installment of the equation have been analyzed in detail .",
    "a principal focus of the relevant properties , aside from issues of self - focusing and wave collapse  @xcite has been the study of the existence , stability and dynamics of solitary waves in this model , both in lower - dimensional settings ( such as one - dimensional solitons and multi - solitons ) and in higher dimensional settings ( vortices , vortex rings , and related structures ) .",
    "however , recent years have seen a gradual increase of interest in the study of near - relativistic settings , where a suitable generalization / extension of the nlse is the so - called nonlinear dirac equation ( nlde )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a modified form of the nlse ( with additional terms ) is a special case limit of the nlde at the low - energy limit as has been demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "different realizations of the nlde have been proposed in the realm of high energy physics , including the so - called massive gross - neveu model  @xcite , as well as the massive thirring model  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the equation has seen a significant volume of studies from a more mathematical perspective .",
    "various aspects have been examined in this context , including the spectral stability and the potential emergence of point spectrum eigenvalues with nonzero real part ( which has been shown to be impossible to happen beyond the so - called embedded thresholds )  @xcite , the orbital and asymptotic stability under a series of relevant assumptions  @xcite , the nonlinear schrdinger ( non - relativistic ) limit and its instability for nonlinearities beyond a critical exponent  @xcite , as well as classical ( vakhitov - kolokolov ) and more suitable to this setting ( energy based ) criteria  @xcite for the linear stability of solitary waves in the nlde .",
    "a series of more computationally / physically oriented studies both in the context of the stability / dynamics of the nlde solitary waves  @xcite ( again , in principle for arbitrary nonlinearity powers ) and in that of these structures in the presence of external fields  @xcite have also recently appeared .",
    "it would be relevant to mention , at least in passing , one more framework where dirac - type equations have received significant attention in recent years in the context of atomic bose - einstein condensates .",
    "this is , in particular , in the context of artificial gauge fields more broadly , and more specifically spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "there , admittedly , the setup is somewhat different , as both the dirac type operator and the schrdinger one co - exist , but the compensating value is that such settings have already been realized experimentally  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a wide range of coherent structures has been already proposed in them including vortices  @xcite , skyrmions @xcite , dirac monopoles @xcite and dark solitons  @xcite , as well as self - trapped states  @xcite , bright solitons  @xcite and gap - solitons  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we will take a somewhat different path from the above works .",
    "in particular , we will consider a relatively standard example of the nlde ( namely the so - called massive gross - neveu model ) , but motivated by the significant level of understanding and analytical tractability afforded by discrete settings  @xcite , we will instead consider a _ spatially discrete form _ of the nlde . a significant part of our motivation for this consideration ( and for the particular form of the selected discretization ) is due to ( a ) the possibility to deploy the technology of the so - called anti - continuum ( ac ) limit of mackay - aubry  @xcite , in order to appreciate the stability properties near the limit of uncoupled adjacent sites and ( b ) the feature that in the continuum limit of , in principle , infinite coupling , our conclusions are expected to connect to what is known for the corresponding pde models that have been explored in the literature . admittedly , the discretization that is selected herein is , arguably , not the most natural possible one ( in that we utilize next - nearest neighbors in order to discretize the first derivative terms by centered differences ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is identified that it is the most suitable one for the present setting type of stencil and discrete solitary waves are systematically obtained from the ac limit . moreover",
    ", a very recent development worth noting is that spin - orbit bose - einstein condensates have recently been considered in the realm of an optical lattice  @xcite , which is often thought ( in the so - called superfluid regime ) as being tantamount to a discretization of the original continuum problem , through a suitable wannier function reduction  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that considering discrete variants of dirac models may be a natural step for near future considerations .    while many of our findings are somewhat reminiscent of the corresponding discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation ones  @xcite , numerous others are rather unique to the dirac equation .",
    "the single site solution is found to lead to a rather unexpected waveform which we explain and illustrate to effectively ( that is , in its envelope ) approach in the continuum limit the solution of a different homoclinic state problem that will be explicitly discussed below . on the other hand ,",
    "it is the two - site and three - site solutions that lead to a continuation all the way to the continuum limit of the gross - neveu solitary wave .",
    "however , contrary to what is the case for the dnls , the two - site solution turns out to be stable close to the ac limit , while the three - site solution is the unstable one close to that limit . a count of the relevant eigenvalues near the ac limit is systematically given for these different cases .",
    "subsequently a near - alternation of stability is observed between these two modes ( the site- and inter - site - centered ones ) that is somewhat reminiscent of the phenomenology identified in the saturable dnls model  @xcite .",
    "this is explored systematically , as is the feature of both of these solutions in producing a complex quartet of modes in a suitable band of the continuous spectrum .",
    "this oscillatory instability and its dynamical by - products are traced as a function of the propagation constant @xmath1 and of the inter - site coupling strength @xmath0 . the dynamical manifestation of the instabilities within the discrete model is shown to lead to different possible features , including the potential mobility of the solitary waves or their splitting into multiple solitary waves of lower amplitude ( and potentially of a different type ) .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present an overview of our discrete model and its basic properties . in section iii , we examine the different solutions in the vicinity of the ac limit . in section",
    "iv we examine the same solutions for large @xmath0 , i.e. , in the vicinity of the corresponding continuum limit .",
    "finally , in section v , we explore the dynamical instability manifestations of the different solutions .",
    "section vi summarizes our findings and presents our conclusions .",
    "the nlde model that we will consider will be the massive gross - neveu model with scalar - scalar interactions and a general power - law nonlinearity .",
    "this is motivated by recent corresponding continuum model explorations both at the level of mathematical analysis  @xcite and at that of numerical computations  @xcite .",
    "the discrete version of the equation introduced herein will be based on a centered difference approximation of the first derivative in the form :    @xmath2    with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being the components of the spinor @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the discrete gradient , with a centered difference scheme , as indicated above .",
    "the connection to the corresponding continuum limit can be assigned by selecting @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the lattice spacing ( discretization parameter ) .",
    "it should also be noted in passing that we attempted to discretize by a forward difference scheme , with considerably less promising results .",
    "given also that the centered difference scheme is a higher order discrete approximation to the corresponding continuum limit , we therefore will only present results by means of the centered difference discretization scheme in what follows .",
    "our main focus hereafter will be on stationary solutions and their stability .",
    "such solutions can be found by using @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and satisfy the coupled algebraic equations :    @xmath11    analogously to its continuum counterpart , the dynamical system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyn ] ) presents a number of conserved quantities , such as the charge ( squared @xmath12 norm ) : @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the charge density , and the hamiltonian : @xmath15.\\ ] ]    the dynamical equations ( [ eq : dyn ] ) can be derived from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) by means of the hamilton s equations :    @xmath16    once stationary solutions of the algebraic system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stat ] ) are calculated ( by e.g. fixed points methods ) , their linear stability is considered by means of a bogoliubov - de gennes linearized stability analysis . more specifically , considering small perturbations",
    "[ of order @xmath17 , with @xmath18 of the stationary solutions , we substitute the ansatz    @xmath19,\\ \\",

    "( [ eq : dyn ] ) , and then solve the ensuing [ to o@xmath20 eigenvalue problem : @xmath21 with @xmath22 being @xmath23 for the eigenvalue @xmath24 and associated eigenvector @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 is a function defined as : @xmath27 with @xmath28 being : @xmath29 and @xmath30    the dispersion relation of the linear excitations corresponds to the continuous spectrum that will be identified in the linearization around the trivial @xmath31 @xmath32 solution .",
    "this relation can be identified by decomposing the perturbations as @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stat ] ) and deriving the resulting condition :    @xmath34    consequently , there are two sets of bands in the essential spectrum .",
    "the embedded part given by @xmath35 $ ] , and the non - embedded part , @xmath36 $ ] . in",
    "what follows , for concreteness we will set @xmath37 and vary @xmath1 , as well as @xmath0 , as our relevant parameters .",
    "in this section , we consider the existence , stability and dynamics of discrete solitons from the ac to the continuum limit . in the ac limit ,",
    "the soliton that can be continued up to the continuum is a three - site soliton , given by @xmath38 @xmath32 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "let us explain below the general behavior for @xmath42 . outside this range ,",
    "the solitary waves are always unstable and hence we do not consider them further here .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ eq : stab ] ) that in the ac limit and for any value of @xmath43 , this three - site solution possesses 3 pairs of modes at @xmath44 , 3 pairs at @xmath45 , @xmath46 pairs at @xmath47 and @xmath46 pairs at @xmath48 . when the coupling is switched on ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stabdisc3s ] ) , the wave becomes exponentially unstable because of one among the 3 pairs at @xmath44 that detaches from the origin yielding an imaginary eigenfrequency pair in a similar way as occurs e.g. for the two - site structure in the dnls equation  @xcite .",
    "the other two vanishing eigenfrequency pairs remain at the origin .",
    "in addition , the eigenmodes at @xmath45 detach into three pairs that will subsequently collide with the embedded and essential parts of the spectrum ; let us denote those modes as a , b , c ( from upper to lower real part of the eigenfrequency ) .",
    "mode c remains exactly at @xmath45 for every coupling .",
    "the real part of the eigenfrequency of mode a rapidly increases entering the embedded spectrum at the point where the imaginary part of the eigenmode responsible for the exponential instability reaches its maximum .",
    "the exponential instability mentioned previously disappears close to ( but not at ) the point where mode c enters the essential spectrum .",
    "however , when the coupling increases , the exponential instability appears again with a similar ( non - monotonic ) behavior as the previous one , except for the presence of smaller growth rates and of a slower decrease in the growth rate ( past the point of the maximal growth rate ) . the most complex parametric dependence is the one experienced by mode b. the latter enters the essential spectrum for a value of @xmath0 higher than that for which mode c enters therein .",
    "then , the system becomes oscillatorily unstable and undergoes a hopf bifurcation [ in the case of finite systems , due to the quantization of the continuous spectrum , this translates into a series of instability bubbles ; for a similar scenario in the dnls see e.g.  @xcite ] . as a consequence ,",
    "there are many oscillations in the imaginary part of mode b when the coupling is high ; the amplitude of those oscillations decreases when the system size increases , as shown in the inset of bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabdisc3s ] ] .",
    "when the frequency increases ( say @xmath49 ) the imaginary part of mode b does not asymptote to a nearly constant value as the coupling strength increases , but , on the contrary , a series of bubbles appears manifesting as oscillations around 0 ( see top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabdisc3s ] ) .",
    "the persistence of those oscillations in the continuum limit will be considered in section [ sec : cont ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : bubbles ] therein ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     lastly",
    ", we should note that we have also examined dynamical instabilities of other structures such as 1- and 2-site solitons .",
    "these often , too , result in mobile coherent structures , especially for large values of @xmath0 , although some states , such as the staggered 1-site wave are less amenable to extensive traveling throughout the lattice , perhaps partly due to their special spatial structure .",
    "in the present work we have examined a lattice analogue of the nonlinear dirac equation .",
    "motivated by the considerable volume of both mathematical and computational investigations of the continuum limit of the corresponding problem , we have developed a prototypical discretization scheme whose continuum limit is the gross - neveu model .",
    "this is a model that while it does not presently possess a straightforward physical realization ( e.g. analogous to what is the case for its dnls analogue and , say , optical waveguide arrays  @xcite ) , it nevertheless is of substantial interest in its own right for a number of reasons .",
    "it is useful ( and relevant to understand ) , on the one hand , as a numerical scheme and a computational tool for approximating the corresponding continuum limit ( in regimes of large coupling strength @xmath0 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "its analytical tractability in the vicinity of the anti - continuum limit of uncoupled sites makes it a useful starting point for the exploration of the spectral properties of solitary waves . in the ac limit",
    ", there is a complete control over these spectral properties and corresponding eigenvalues , and it then remains to appreciate the continuation of these over the coupling strength @xmath0 , in order to understand both the features of the discrete model and those of its continuum limit .",
    "moreover , the physical realization of quasi - discrete systems possessing dirac - like dynamics such as spin - orbit bose - einstein condensates in the presence of optical lattices very recently  @xcite , seems to strongly suggest the potential experimentally - relevant realization of models of this class in the near future .    in light of the above motivations , here we have shown a multitude of unexpected properties that merit further studies not only from a computational but also importantly from a rigorously mathematical point of view .",
    "in particular , we showed that a single site excitation does not continue , as might be expected , to a continuum solitary wave of the gross - neveu model .",
    "instead , it forms a remarkable staggered structure that approaches in the limit of @xmath0 large ( while being preserved as a state ) the envelope of the homoclinic orbit of a different dynamical model .",
    "this appears to be a fairly robust structure in its parametric dependence over @xmath0 and @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two- and three - site initial excitations play the role , respectively , of the one- and two - site excitations of the dnls . yet , here a situation more akin to the saturable analogue of the dnls occurs  @xcite , whereby exchanges of stability between the on - site and inter - site solutions arise .",
    "likely , and analogously to corresponding dnls cubic - quintic or saturable settings , these exchanges are mediated by pitchfork bifurcations ( and reverse pitchforks ) generating asymmetric waveforms , a topic potentially worthy of further investigation in the future . additionally , these states appear to possess quartet of eigenfrequencies chiefly responsible for their instability .",
    "while this instability appears to reach an asymptotic growth rate ( over @xmath0 variations ) for values of @xmath1 below a critical one , it is an open problem whether indeed this instability is expected to be present in the continuum limit of the problem . in that connection , it is relevant to point out that we have observed the manifestation of the instability to potentially lead to traveling and mobility of the structure , while in other cases , we have observed it to lead to a fragmentation of the solitary wave into the staggered structures , a feature which would not be `` accessible '' in the continuum limit .",
    "it should also be pointed out that despite our computation for different domain sizes as a function of @xmath1 for large ( approaching the continuum ) values of @xmath0 , the concavity of the relevant eigenvalue dependence precludes a straightforward determination of the associated critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be safely inferred that the instability ( at least for sub - critical exponents @xmath50 ) is absent in the nonrelativistic schrdinger limit . nevertheless , whether this occurs asymptotically as @xmath51 or at a finite @xmath52 ( the latter being observed in the case of our finite -but large- coupling and domain size )",
    "remains yet another important open question .",
    "naturally , the present investigation , as a primary one of its kind , raises a considerable volume of additional questions meriting future examination both at the discrete and at the continuum limit .",
    "in particular , a key issue is how the discrete model asymptotes to the actual corresponding continuum .",
    "it is especially important to understand how the spectral properties may be modified in the limit .",
    "another very interesting avenue of research would be to develop and utilize the solvability conditions that were especially handy in the dnls case to understand the unusual existence and stability features in the corresponding dirac case .",
    "understanding also better the role ( especially in the dynamics ) of the unusual staggered structure would be especially relevant .",
    "other themes , such as a classification of the dynamical instability scenaria for different states or the identification of the exponential instability in the near - linear limit of small @xmath43 have also emerged . beyond the realm of `` single pulses '' focused upon herein , the cases of multi - pulses , pulse interactions and related themes are entirely open , to the best of our knowledge , not only in the discrete case but largely also in the continuum one",
    ". finally , all these investigations could naturally be generalized to higher dimensions , where also vortical and related structures could potentially arise  @xcite .",
    "some of these topics are currently under investigation and will be reported in future publications .",
