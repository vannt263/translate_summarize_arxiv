    "one interesting problem in quantum chromodynamics is the calculation of gluon distribution between quarks .",
    "if we calculate the field distribution between two quarks we will obtain a hypothesized flux tube that is the main point of the confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the problem is analogous to the calculation of a static electric field between electron and positron in electrodynamics with one essential difference .",
    "the field distribution between quarks and between electric charges are essentially different : the gluon field between two quarks is confined into a tube but the electric field is distributed in the whole space .",
    "if we will calculate the field distribution between three quarks we will obtain a gluon distribution between quarks in a hadron . in electrodynamics",
    "we have not any analogous problem because quarks may have three different kind of charge : , and .",
    "but the electric charge has not a color index .    here",
    "we will calculate the gluon field distribution between three infinitely separated quarks .",
    "but why infinitely separated ?",
    "the answer is that we have the field distribution between two quarks @xcite . in this case in a first approximation we can obtain the field distribution between three quarks as three flux tubes connecting three infinitely spaced quarks .",
    "the analytical calculations of the gluon field distribution between quarks can not be carried out in the consequence of missing of a nonperturbative calculation technique in quantum field theory . there",
    "exist calculations of the field distribution between quarks on lattice , see for example , ref .",
    "the lattice calculations allow us to investigate a gauge field distribution between quarks .",
    "but the problem in lattice calculations is that we have not any analytical expression for investigated quantities such as : fields ; potentials ; energy , action , monopole densities and so on .",
    "another problem is that we are not self - confident yet that there exists a limit when a grid size of lattice tends zero .",
    "our calculations are following : ( a ) we will recall how one can obtain the flux tube following to ref .",
    "@xcite , ( b ) we will clarify what is the origin of a color electric field in the flux tube and ( c ) we will connect three infinitely spaces quarks with these flux tubes filled with color electric fields .",
    "nonperturbative quantization is unresolved problem in modern theoretical physics . here for the calculations in quantum chromodynamics we use following approximate method : we calculate su(3 ) gluon condensate @xmath0 which up to a sign is the quantum averaged su(3 ) lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the field strength ; @xmath3 are the su(3 ) color indices ; @xmath4 is the coupling constant ; @xmath5 are the structure constants for the su(3 ) gauge group and @xmath4 is the coupling constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that using some assumptions and approximations one can reduce su(3 ) lagrangian to an effective lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a complex scalar field describing quantum fluctuations of @xmath8 gauge field components ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are some parameters .    in order to obtain effective lagrangian we have used following assumptions :    * the first assumption is that the su(3 ) gauge potential @xmath11 can be separated on two parts : * * the first one is the gauge components @xmath12 which is in a classical state ; * * the second one is @xmath8 and it is in a quantum state .",
    "+ one can say that @xmath13 is in an ordered phase and @xmath14 is in a disordered phase . *",
    "the second assumption is that the 2-point green s function of color quantum field can be approximately presented as the product of scalar fields with some coefficients having color and lorentzian indices . *",
    "the third assumption is that the 4-point green s function can be decomposed as the product of two 2-point green s functions .",
    "the second and third assumptions gives rise to the fact that 2 and 4-point green s functions are @xmath15 the field equations for the lagrangian are @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite the index @xmath17 , i.e. the su(2 ) subgroup on generators @xmath18 is spanned ( @xmath19 are gell - mann matrices that are su(3 ) generators ) . of coarse",
    "it is not necessary .",
    "it is necessary only that the index @xmath20 will be the index of some su(2 ) subgroup .",
    "for example , it can be : @xmath21 .",
    "it follows form the fact there are following su(3 ) structure constants @xmath22 which describe su(2 ) subgroups @xmath23 .",
    "this difference is unessential because we can redefine coupling constant @xmath4 in such a way that to kill the factor @xmath24 .",
    "if we choose su(2 ) subgroup spanned on su(3 ) generators @xmath25 then the solution one can search in the following form @xmath26 here @xmath27 are cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the substitution into equations gives us @xmath28 \\label{1 - 80}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we redefined @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the color electric and magnetic fields are @xmath35",
    "the most important here is that the color longitudinal electric field @xmath36 is not a gradient of a gauge potential but is the consequence of a nonlinear term in the definition of the field tensor @xmath37 .",
    "for the numerical calculations we choose the following parameters values @xmath38 the numerical values of these parameters are not unique but qualitative behavior of the functions @xmath39 are the same .",
    "the solution of eq s - with parameters is presented in fig s [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "now we would like to discuss what is the source of the above mentioned longitudinal electric field @xmath36 .",
    "firstly we would like to calculate the flux of the chromoelectric field @xmath36 @xmath40 it is nonzero and consequently at the ends of the color flux tube should be color sources of this color field . for the determination of the color sources we will remind the su(3 ) lagrangian with quarks",
    "@xmath41 here we follow to @xcite ; @xmath42 are the su(3 ) generators ; spinor @xmath43 describe quarks @xmath44 where spinors @xmath45 describe , and quarks correspondingly .",
    "the term @xmath46 describes the source for the @xmath47 field .",
    "in our case we have @xmath48 .",
    "consequently the source of the color nonabelian longitudinal electric field has the form @xmath49 thus at the ends of this flux tube there are quarks @xmath50 and @xmath51 components generate the / color longitudinal electric field @xmath48 .",
    "now is the time to discuss the simplest model of gluon field distribution between three quarks .",
    "we simplify such model moving off the quarks to the infinity . in this case",
    "we can use the flux tube obtained in the section [ tube ] .",
    "let us consider three quarks @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "let us assume that the flux tube with @xmath48 longitudinal electric field is stretched between @xmath53 and @xmath54 quarks .",
    "now we change su(2 ) subgroup spanned on @xmath25 on the su(2 ) subgroup spanned on @xmath55",
    ". then one can use ansatz @xmath56 for such choice the color electric and magnetic fields will be @xmath57 consequently the source of the color longitudinal electric has the form @xmath58 thus at the ends of this flux tube there are quarks @xmath59 and their @xmath60 components generate the / color longitudinal electric field @xmath61 .    in the same way one can choose the su(2 ) subgroup spanned on su(3 ) generators @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath63 for such choice the color electric and magnetic fields will be @xmath64 consequently the source of the color longitudinal electric has the form @xmath65 thus at the ends of this flux tube there are quarks @xmath66 and their @xmath67 components generate the / color longitudinal electric field @xmath61 .",
    "finally , connecting three quarks @xmath52 with corresponding color flux tubes we will obtain the construction from three quarks presented in fig .",
    "thus we have obtained the field distribution of the su(3 ) gauge field between three infinitely spaced quarks , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in order to obtain such distribution",
    "we have used the flux tube solution obtained by a nonperturbative quantization method @xcite .",
    "the problem of obtaining the field distribution between three color charges has not any analogy to a similar problem in electrodynamics .",
    "the point is that the color charges have additional degrees of freedom : color indices and this fact gives rise to principal difference between nonabelian and abelian gauge fields .",
    "the difference can be illustrated for the field distribution for three su(3 ) color charges - , , quarks . let us consider fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for every pair @xmath68 the gluon field",
    "is concentrated in a tube ( in the first approximation ) .",
    "a color longitudinal electric field is created from the pair either , or , or , quark degrees of freedom .",
    "it allows us to construct field distribution between three quarks similar to the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the construction of the field distribution of a nonabelian gauge fields between three quarks presented here is approximate one .",
    "more exact description one can obtain considering the quarks spaced at a finite distance .",
    "such construction can be considered as a model of a nucleon filled with three quarks .",
    "the model considered here is a rough approximation for nucleon .",
