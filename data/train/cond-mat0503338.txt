    "all high - transition - temperature ( high-@xmath8 ) copper oxides ( cuprates ) have insulating antiferromagnetic ( af ) , superconducting ( sc ) , and metallic phases @xcite . understanding the nature of these coexisting and competing phases is a key challenge of current research in high-@xmath8 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "while the sc phase in cuprates arises from hole ( @xmath9-type ) or electron ( @xmath10-type ) doping of the insulating af phase , it is still unclear how the superconductivity is related to the af phase @xcite .    in the hole - doped la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 ( lsco ) near @xmath14 @xcite and la@xmath3cuo@xmath15 @xcite , neutron scattering experiments have revealed the presence of a static incommensurate spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order in coexistence with the superconductivity .",

    "a @xmath6-axis magnetic field induces spin fluctuations below the spin - gap energy and drives the system toward static af order @xcite .",
    "since the same field applied in the cuo@xmath3 plane has little effect on superconductivity or the sdw order @xcite , these results suggest that antiferromagnetism is a competing ground state revealed by the suppression of superconductivity @xcite .    if suppression of superconductivity in hole - doped lsco indeed drives the system toward an af ordered state , it is important to determine the universality of such a feature in other sc copper oxides @xcite . although neutron scattering experiments failed to confirm any enhancement of the static long - range af order in hole - doped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath31 for a @xmath6-axis aligned field up to 7-t @xcite , these measurements may not be conclusive because of the enormous upper critical fields @xmath32 ( @xmath33-t for @xmath6-axis aligned fields ) required to completely suppress superconductivity .",
    "compared to hole - doped cuprates , electron - doped materials offer a unique opportunity for studying the magnetic field - induced effect for two reasons .",
    "first , electron - doped materials generally have upper critical fields less than 15-t @xcite , a value reachable in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "second , electron - doped materials can be transformed from as - grown nonsuperconducting ( nsc ) af insulators to full superconductivity by simply annealing the samples at different temperatures to modify the charge carrier density @xcite .",
    "this unique property allows the possibility of studying the nsc to sc transition in electron - doped cuprates without the complications of structural and/or chemical disorder induced by chemical substitution in hole - doped materials .",
    "recently , we discovered that when superconductivity first appears in one family of electron - doped superconductors , pr@xmath0lace@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( plcco ) , a commensurate quasi-2d sdw order is also induced @xcite , and both coexist with the residual three - dimensional ( 3d ) af state @xcite .",

    "the induced af moments scale approximately linearly with the applied field , saturate at @xmath32 , and then decrease for higher fields .",
    "these results thus indicate that af order is a competing ground state to superconductivity in electron - doped nd@xmath23ce@xmath24cuo@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "although electron - doped ncco offers a unique opportunity for studying the superconductivity - suppressed ground state of high-@xmath8 cuprates , the system has one important complication .",
    "the as - grown material is nsc , and has to be oxygen reduced to render the system superconducting .",
    "this reducing process has been found to produce a small quantity of the cubic ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 as an impurity phase @xcite . generally , a small amount ( 0.01% to 1% ) of randomly distributed impurity would be unobservable , but ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 stabilizes as an oriented crystalline lattice in the ncco matrix because its lattice constant is about 2@xmath39 larger than the planner lattice constant of the tetragonal ncco ( @xmath40   and @xmath41 ) .",
    "this in - plane lattice match with ncco means reflections at @xmath42 of ncco in reciprocal space may also stem from ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 , thus giving structural impurity peaks that match some of the magnetic peaks [ such as @xmath7 ] . in the paramagnetic state of ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 , a field induces a net magnetization on nd@xmath44 , which can then contaminate the intensity of the cuprate magnetic peak such as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "there are three ways to resolve this impurity problem and determine the intrinsic properties of electron - doped materials .",
    "first , since the impurity and cuprate peaks are not lattice matched along the @xmath6-axis direction ( the lattice constant of impurity is about 10% smaller than that of ncco ) , the impurity peaks occur at positions such as @xmath45 @xmath46 , 4.4 , and so on @xcite .",
    "this allows the impurity scattering to be determined separately , and the in - plane scattering can then be corrected by subtracting the impurity contribution to ascertain the ncco contribution of the in - plane peaks @xcite .",
    "second , with a @xmath6-axis - aligned magnetic field and @xmath6-axis in the scattering plane , the non - zero integer @xmath47 positions ( @xmath48 , 2 , 3 , @xmath49 ) can be measured without any possible impurity contribution .",
    "we carried out such an experiment using a horizontal field magnet and found that application of a 4-t @xmath6-axis aligned magnetic field enhances the @xmath50 af reflection in the optimally doped sc nd@xmath23ce@xmath24cuo@xmath13 @xcite .",

    "this approach avoids complications of ce - substitution for different @xmath8 materials . for underdoped samples with @xmath8 s below 25 k , superconductivity coexists with both the 3d af - type order of the undoped material and a commensurate quasi-2d sdw modulation @xcite .",

    "when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath5 $ ] direction parallel to the cuo@xmath3 plane , the noncollinear af spin structure of plcco is transformed into a collinear one through a `` spin - flop '' transition @xcite . such a spin - flop transition is continuous in semiconducting plcco but gradually changes to discontinuous with increasing doping and the appearance of superconductivity . for sc plcco ,",

    "we grew high quality plcco single crystals ( cylindrical rods weight 0.8 - 1.5 grams with mosaicity @xmath65 ) using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and annealed the samples in pure ar at different temperatures to control the sc transition temperatures .",
    "the partial substitution of pr with la was used to stabilize the crystal growth without introducing significant lattice distortions @xcite .",
    "we obtained three sc plcco samples with the onset temperature for bulk superconductivity at @xmath66 k , 21 k , and 16 k from magnetic susceptibility measurements ( fig .",
    "the @xmath67 k , and 21 k samples are obtained by annealing the as - grown single crystals in pure argon at @xmath68c and @xmath69c for 24 hours , respectively . to obtain the @xmath70",
    "k crystal , the as - grown sample was annealed in pure argon at @xmath71c for 1 week .",
    "the sc plcco of @xmath72 k and 16 k are near the phase boundary between af and sc phases and the @xmath67 k sample is in the optimally doped regime .",
    "we also obtained a nsc sample by annealing one of the sc @xmath70 k samples in air at @xmath73c for 24 hours @xcite .",
    "one of the open questions in electron - doped superconductors is the role of the annealing process to superconductivity @xcite . in earlier works",
    ", it was postulated that as - grown nsc samples have excess oxygen atoms above copper sites ( apical oxygen ) .",
    "these extraneous oxygen atoms have been believed to induce a local disordered potential that localizes doped electrons and therefore prohibits superconductivity @xcite .",
    "when the annealing process removes these defect oxygen atoms at apical sites , the electrons will not be localized and the superconductivity appears .",
    "the magnitude of the hall coefficient in annealed ncco ( @xmath74 ) decreases dramatically below @xmath75 k , very differently from the as - grown sample @xcite .",
    "this suggests that annealing changes the mobile charge density . to understand what annealing does to our plcco samples",
    ", we have performed thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) of our samples under different annealing conditions .",
    "figure 3b shows the temperature dependence of the weight change for a @xmath76 sample during the annealing process .",
    "the large drop in weight change shows up as a kink in the data and a sharp dip in its derivative ; we interpret this kink to be indicative of the point where the oxygen content becomes the closest to stoichiometry , namely @xmath77 @xcite . in any case",
    ", the tga data give the most direct evidence that oxygen content of the sample is reduced during the annealing process .     for the @xmath57 k plcco .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye .",
    "the arrows indicate @xmath8 and @xmath61 , respectively . ]    while tga analysis indicates a decreased oxygen content after the reduction process , it is still unclear whether the apical oxygen is removed @xcite . indeed , recent raman and crystal - field infrared transmission results suggest that instead of removing apical oxygen as originally thought , reduction of optimally doped pr@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath2 and ncco samples actually involves only oxygens in the cuo@xmath3 plane @xcite . clearly , the exact oxygen content and their arrangements in the crystal before and after the reduction need to be sorted out by future studies .",
    "another issue to be noted regarding the plcco material is the relevance of the ( pr , la , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 impurity phase , which plays the same role in plcco as the ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 phase in ncco . to understand the effect of annealing on this impurity phase , we have performed systematic synchrotron x - ray diffraction investigations on as - grown nsc , sc , and re - oxygenated nsc plcco samples at the advanced photon source , argonne national laboratory .",
    "we confirm that the ( pr , la , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 impurity phase can be produced by annealing and but it vanishes after the reoxygenation process @xcite ; such a behavior is rather strange , but is understandable if the host plcco crystals are slightly cu deficient . to confirm this possibility , inductively - coupled plasma atomic - emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) analysis was performed on a batch of crystals that are nominally pr@xmath51la@xmath52ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the reference solution is prepared by diluting commercial standard solutions not by the volume but by the weight , which enables us to calculate the cation concentration of the reference with a high resolution . a piece of the pr@xmath51la@xmath52ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 crystal ( 1 mg ) is dissolved into a 30 @xmath78 of hno@xmath4 ( 1 mol / liter ) .",
    "the analyzed cation ratio of the nominally pr@xmath51la@xmath52ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 sample was @xmath79 , with a relative error of less than 1% for each element .",
    "this result shows that cu is indeed deficient by about 3% in the pr@xmath80la@xmath52ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 crystal , which is probably also true for plcco . assuming that as - grown plcco samples are slightly cu deficient as pr@xmath80la@xmath52ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , the effect of annealing is then to remove oxygen in plcco to form the ( pr , la , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 impurity and make the remaining crystal structure more perfect for superconductivity .",
    "this analysis can potentially explain why the ( pr , la , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 impurity phase can be reversibly produced @xcite .",
    "our neutron scattering measurements were performed on the hb-1a , hb-1 , and hb-3 triple - axis spectrometers at the high - flux - isotope reactor ( hfir ) , oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) and on the e4 two - axis diffractometer and e1 triple - axis spectrometer at the berlin neutron scattering center , hahn - meitner - institute ( hmi ) .",

    ", it would also be interesting to check if their @xmath56 plcco sample has a field - induced effect at @xmath7 . at present , it is unclear how to reconcile our results with that of fujita _ et al .",
    "perhaps the differences in ce concentration and/or post annealing oxygen treatment plays an important role in determining the properties of these materials . in any case , what is clear is that underdoped plcco has a field - induced effect unrelated to the impurity phase , and such an effect appears to be associated with the suppression of superconductivity @xcite .    to determine the influence of an applied field on the residual 3d af order in sc electron - doped cuprates , one must understand the differences in the field - induced effect between optimally doped ncco and underdoped plcco .",

    "the pr@xmath44 induced moment contributes destructively to the cu@xmath53 moment in plcco . as a consequence , any field - induced pr@xmath44 moment should reduce the scattering intensity at @xmath133 for plcco while a small cu@xmath53 moment enhancement will induce large intensity enhancement at @xmath131 and @xmath132 for ncco .",
    "since sc plcco has a negligible field - induced pr@xmath44 moment , a small field - induced enhancement in the cu@xmath53 moment may not be easily observable at @xmath133 .",
    "our results can be thought of as analogous to that in hole - doped lsco .",

    ", we also find the simultaneous appearance of a quasi-2d sdw order and superconductivity , except in this case the sdw modulations are commensurate with the underlying lattice ( fig .",
    "1a ) @xcite .",
    "similar to lsco , optimally doped plcco also does not exhibit static sdw order .",
    "work is currently underway to determine the size of the spin gap and spin fluctuations at high energies .",
    "when a @xmath6-axis aligned magnetic field is applied , the static commensurate sdw order is enhanced for underdoped plcco but not for optimally doped samples .",
    "these results are very similar to hole - doped lsco , thus suggesting the universality of the magnetic properties in both hole- and electron - doped cuprates . in the coming years",
    ", neutron scattering experiments will be carried out to search for the spin excitations in optimally and underdoped plcco .",
    "our ultimate goal is to determine whether magnetism plays a fundamental role in controlling the properties of doped cuprates and the mechanism of high-@xmath8 superconductivity",
    "we have systematically investigated the effect of a magnetic field on electron - doped plcco materials from an af insulator to an optimally doped superconductor . by controlling the annealing temperatures",

    "when superconductivity first appears in plcco , a quasi-2d sdw order is also induced at @xmath7 , and both coexist with the residual 3d af state . while the annealing process also induces cubic ( pr , la , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 as an impurity phase similar to ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4 in sc ncco , we show that a magnetic field up to 14-t does not induce magnetic scattering in this impurity phase . to determine whether af order is a competing ground state for superconductivity in electron - doped superconductors , we first must understand the influence of a magnetic field on the residual af order for sc and nsc plcco without the complication of superconductivity .",
    "we confirm that a @xmath6-axis aligned magnetic field has no effect on the af order in the nsc plcco .",
    "because plcco is a layered superconductor with highly anisotropic @xmath32 , superconductivity can be dramatically suppressed by a @xmath135-axis field but much less affected by the same field in the cuo@xmath3 plane . utilizing this property , we determine the influence of an in - plane magnetic field on the residual af order in sc plcco .",
    "we find that a 14-t field along the @xmath5 $ ] direction only causes a spin - flop transition but does not induce additional moments on cu@xmath53 and/or pr@xmath44 site in the sc plcco s .",
    "this suggests that the residual af order in sc plcco behaves in a similar way as af order in nsc materials .    to study the magnetic field effect on sdw modulations in sc plcco , we conducted experiments in two ways",
    ". first , we aligned the crystal in the @xmath34 $ ] geometry and applied magnetic field along the @xmath6-axis . for both @xmath64 k and 16 k plcco samples , the @xmath6-axis aligned field enhances the sdw order at the @xmath136 position but has no observable effect at the 3d af order position @xmath60 .",
    "the field - induced enhancement at @xmath137 increases with increasing magnetic field up to 13.5-t for the @xmath64 k sample .",
    "the @xmath70 k sample also shows a field - induced effect at @xmath7 for measured fields up to 6.8-t .",
    "second , the crystal was aligned in the @xmath35 $ ] scattering plane and a magnetic field was applied along the @xmath5 $ ] direction . in this scattering geometry , both @xmath123 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] radial scans around the @xmath7 position in the cuo@xmath3-plane show no observable field - induced effect .",
    "this anisotropy of a field effect confirms that the enhancement of sdw in the @xmath6-axis field direction is related to the suppression of superconductivity .",
