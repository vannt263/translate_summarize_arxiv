    "a dehn filling of a torus boundary component of a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath5 is * exceptional * if it results in a non - hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "thurston showed that exceptional fillings truly are exceptional : for a fixed compact hyperbolic @xmath5 , there are only finitely many exceptional fillings ( see @xcite . as a result of the geometrization theorem @xcite , a compact , orientable , non",
    "- hyperbolic 3-manifold is either reducible , boundary - reducible , annular , toroidal , or a small seifert fibered space .",
    "we say that the corresponding filling is reducible , boundary - reducible , etc .",
    "if we have two exceptional fillings we refer to them as x / y for x and y in the set @xmath6    in the past few decades , a great deal of work has been done ( see @xcite for a survey ) to understand the relationship between distinct exceptional fillings on a fixed @xmath5 .",
    "much of the work has focused on finding sharp upper bounds on the `` slope distance '' @xmath7 between the filling slopes for particular choices of @xmath8 , and then enumerating the specific situations in which the maximum value of @xmath7 can be realized .",
    "although much has been accomplished , there are still important open problems ( for example the cabling conjecture @xcite . ) beyond the cabling conjecture , the situation when @xmath9 or @xmath10 is toroidal has generated a lot of interest . in studying such fillings ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the nature of the essential torus and its relation to the core of the filling solid - torus often play an important role . in this note , we show how a slight adaptation of methods used by gabai @xcite to prove the property r and poenaru conjectures ; scharlemann @xcite in the study of the reducible / reducible and reducible / boundary - reducible cases ; and wu @xcite in the study of the reducible / annular case can be adapted to give very low upper bounds on slope distance for certain types of toroidal / y fillings , for y @xmath11 .",
    "this paper has been written so that it should suffice as a gentle introduction to the sutured manifold techniques of scharlemann ( and subsequently , wu ) .",
    "we have also made an effort to collect some well - known combinatorial techniques ( e.g. scharlemann cycles ) so that the non - sutured manifold part of this paper is relatively self - contained .    for convenience in stating our theorems , we establish the following definitions and conventions .",
    "@xmath5 is a compact , orientable 3-manifold with a torus boundary component containing essential simple closed curves @xmath12 and @xmath13 intersecting minimally @xmath14 times .",
    "the 3-manifolds @xmath3 and @xmath1 are obtained by dehn filling @xmath15 with slopes @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . usually @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "will denote the cores of the filling tori , although occasionally we allow them to be other 1-complexes .",
    "the * @xmath0-norm * of a connected oriented surface @xmath18 transverse to @xmath0 is @xmath19 the @xmath0-norm of a disconnected surface is the sum of the @xmath0-norms of its components .",
    "this definition is , in fact , applicable whenever @xmath0 is a given 1-complex ( not necessarily a knot ) .",
    "perhaps the most important instance is when @xmath0 is taken to be the empty set , in which case we have @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 connected ) and refer to it as the * thurston norm * of the surface @xmath21 .",
    "the ( possibly disconnected ) surface @xmath21 is * @xmath22-taut * if it is incompressible and minimizes thurston norm ; that is , if @xmath23 is another oriented surface such that @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] are equal in @xmath26 then @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , for any 1-complex @xmath0 , the surface @xmath21 is * @xmath0-taut * if @xmath28 is incompressible in @xmath29 , if @xmath21 minimizes @xmath0-norm in the class @xmath25 \\in h_2(m,{\\partial}s)$ ] and if @xmath0 always intersects @xmath21 with the same sign .    by analogy with knots in solid tori , we can define the * wrapping number * of a knot @xmath0 with respect to a class @xmath30 to be the minimal geometric intersection number of @xmath0 with a @xmath22-taut surface representing @xmath31 and the * winding number * of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath31 to be the absolute value of the algebraic intersection number of @xmath0 with a surface representing @xmath31 .",
    "winding number is independent of the representative of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , for a class @xmath32 the following two statements are equivalent :    * there is no representative of @xmath31 which is both @xmath22-taut and @xmath0-taut . *",
    "the wrapping number and the winding number of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath31 differ .",
    "if @xmath31 satisfies these statements we say that @xmath31 is an * exceptional class * in @xmath1 ( with respect to @xmath0 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath33 * has an exceptional class * if there is an exceptional class in @xmath2 with respect to @xmath0 .    as a consequence of more general results , we prove",
    ":    assume the following :    * @xmath5 is irreducible and boundary - irreducible * @xmath34 , @xmath1 is irreducible , and @xmath33 has an exceptional class    then the following hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is boundary - irreducible .",
    "2 .   if @xmath3 has an essential sphere , then @xmath3 has a lens space proper summand .",
    "3 .   if @xmath3 is irreducible and has an essential torus , then either @xmath35 or there is an essential torus bounding ( possibly with a component of @xmath36 ) a submanifold of @xmath3 of heegaard genus 2 . 4 .   assume that @xmath3 is irreducible and atoroidal and that @xmath36 has at most two components of genus 2 or greater .",
    "then if @xmath3 has an essential annulus , either @xmath35 or @xmath36 is a single torus and @xmath3 has heegaard genus 2 .",
    "most all cable knots always have a longitudinal surgery producing a reducible 3-manifold with a lens space proper summand .",
    "gordon and luecke ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) show that a reducing surgery on a knot in @xmath37 always produces a 3-manifold with a lens space proper summand .",
    "our result proves an analogous theorem for knots @xmath17 having distinct winding and wrapping numbers with respect to a non - zero class in @xmath2 .",
    "gordon and luecke also show that a knot with irreducible exterior in @xmath37 @xcite or in a reducible 3-manifold @xcite with a non - trivial reducing surgery will have the surgery distance @xmath35 .",
    "does a similar result hold in our situation ?",
    "it is always possible to create knots having toroidal surgeries by taking curves lying on sufficiently knotted genus two surfaces .",
    "the essential torus in the surgered manifold will intersect the core of the surgery torus one or two times and the surgery distance ( from the meridian of the knot ) will be 1 .",
    "thus , the most interesting constructions of toroidal surgeries either have @xmath4 or have tori intersecting the core of the surgery torus three or more times .",
    "gordon and luecke prove @xcite that if surgery on a knot @xmath0 in @xmath37 with surgery distance @xmath4 produces a 3-manifold @xmath3 with an essential torus , then @xmath38 and there is an essential torus in @xmath3 intersecting @xmath39 in exactly two points .",
    "they go on @xcite to show that , in fact , @xmath0 must be a eudave - muoz knot @xcite .",
    "is a similar classification is possible in our case ?",
    "an important special case of our theorem is the case when the exceptional class for @xmath33 can be represented by a torus .",
    "such a torus will be `` non - positive '' ( in the sense of @xcite ) and `` non - polarized '' ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "if such is the case , then the exterior of @xmath0 will have two toroidal fillings of distinct slopes .",
    "gordon @xcite conjectured that if @xmath5 is hyperbolic and if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are slopes giving exceptional dehn fillings , then @xmath40 and , unless @xmath5 is the exterior of the figure 8 knot , then @xmath41 .",
    "he also conjectured that unless @xmath5 is one of four particular manifolds , then @xmath42 .",
    "lackenby and meyerhoff @xcite have shown the first part of gordon s conjecture and agol @xcite has shown that @xmath42 except for finitely many possibilities for @xmath5 .",
    "for particular types of exceptional fillings , sharp upper bounds on @xmath7 are known ( see , for example , @xcite . ) often , the maximum value for @xmath7 is achieved only in very specific and identifiable situations , but elucidating precisely what happens is an area of active research .",
    "for example , gordon @xcite has shown that for toroidal / toroidal exceptional surgeries @xmath40 and if @xmath43 , then the situation is completely understood .",
    "gordon and wu @xcite continue this work and give a complete explanation of toroidal / toroidal exceptional surgeries with @xmath44 .    using the techniques we adapt for this paper , scharlemann @xcite produces very strong results concerning x / y surgeries for x , y @xmath45 \\{reducible",
    ", boundary - reducible}. to simplify our exposition , we do not spend much time considering those possibilities and instead refer the reader to scharlemann s paper @xcite .",
    "in fact , this note could serve as an introduction to scharlemann s work , since at present we are not concerned with tackling the cabling conjecture . along the way , though , we use heegaard splitting theory to improve the conclusions of some of the results .",
    "the papers @xcite , among others , use non - sutured manifold techniques to consider x / y for x , y @xmath45 \\{reducible , boundary - reducible , annular , toroidal } and obtain larger bounds for @xmath7 . in many cases ,",
    "the bounds obtained in those papers are sharp , and the situations realizing the maximal values of @xmath7 are completely classified . in @xcite ,",
    "wu uses sutured manifold theory to consider reducible / annular exceptional surgeries .",
    "theorems 3.3 and 3.4 from that paper consider x / y exceptional surgeries with x @xmath45 \\{reducible , boundary - reducible } and y @xmath45 \\{toroidal , annular}. under slightly different hypotheses from those of theorem [ main thm 2 ] above , wu also obtains @xmath35 .",
    "the sutured manifold techniques used in the proofs of those theorems are very different from those in this paper and rely heavily on essential laminations . using sutured manifold techniques similar to those in this paper ( and , of course , in @xcite ) , and a detailed analysis of gabai discs , wu , under certain mild hypotheses , obtains the bound @xmath46 for reducible / annular exceptional surgeries .",
    "this present paper can also be seen as an introduction to that part of wu s paper .",
    "our results are also closely connected with a famous result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.4 ) of gabai s : if @xmath47 is a boundary component of a compact , orientable , irreducible , atoroidal 3-manifold @xmath5 having @xmath15 the union of tori and if @xmath48 , then at most one dehn filling of @xmath47 can reduce the thurston norm of a class of @xmath49 or make @xmath5 reducible .",
    "lackenby @xcite used gabai s work as the basis for showing that , under certain somewhat technical hypotheses , if @xmath16 is a null - homologous knot and if a reducible 3-manifold @xmath1 is obtained by surgery on @xmath39 , then any closed surface @xmath50 can be isotoped so that @xmath51 where @xmath7 is the intersection number between the surgery slope and the meridian of @xmath39 .",
    "we observe that the statement that the thurston norm of a class of @xmath52 drops after dehn filling is equivalent to the statement that this class is an exceptional class for @xmath33 where @xmath0 is the core of the filling solid torus .",
    "thus , our results are in some sense a generalization of lackenby s .",
    "in particular , the assumption that @xmath0 is null - homologous in @xmath1 can be dropped .",
    "it comes at the cost , however , that we need to consider the surfaces @xmath50 up to the relation of `` rational cobordism '' which is more general than isotopy .",
    "our version of lackenby s theorem is most naturally stated in terms of sutured manifold theory , and we do this in the next section . here , we content ourselves with defining rational cobordism stating a simple consequence .    two properly embedded oriented surfaces @xmath53 and @xmath54 are * rationally cobordant * if @xmath55 , if their interiors are disjoint , and if they cobound a 3-dimensional submanifold @xmath56 such that the inclusions of each of @xmath53 and @xmath54 into @xmath57 induce isomorphisms of rational homology groups .",
    "we extend the definition of `` rationally cobordant '' to make it an equivalence relation on properly embedded surfaces .",
    "a surface @xmath50 is * rationally inessential * if it is rationally cobordant to an inessential surface .",
    "assume ( a ) - ( d ) in section [ apps ] and also that @xmath1 is reducible or that @xmath33 has an exceptional class .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 contains a rationally essential closed surface @xmath53 of genus @xmath58 .",
    "then : @xmath59    assumptions ( a ) - ( d ) are similar to the hypotheses of theorem [ main thm 2 ] .",
    "they rule out a narrow class of possibilities for @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 and require that @xmath34 .",
    "most of what we do applies not only to questions about dehn filling , but also to questions about 2-handle addition .",
    "the techniques in this paper as applied to 2-handle addition are elaborated and generalized in @xcite .",
    "a more directly analogous version of lackenby s result for 2-handle addition is obtained in @xcite ( using much more sophisticated sutured manifold theory ) and several applications of that result are given in @xcite .",
    "for reference , we extend the definition of `` exceptional class '' to arcs .",
    "if @xmath17 is a properly embedded arc , a class @xmath30 is * exceptional * if no representative of @xmath31 is both @xmath0-taut and @xmath22-taut .",
    "we can not rephrase this in terms of wrapping and winding number , since we may be able to change the algebraic intersection number between @xmath0 and a surface representing @xmath31 by isotoping @xmath60 across an endpoint of @xmath0 .",
    "although most of the arguments in this paper are classical , their applications to questions about exceptional surgeries do not seem to be well - known .",
