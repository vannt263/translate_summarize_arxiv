    "binary systems are ubiquitous in all known stellar populations",

    "realistic star - cluster models should therefore contain @xmath29 at birth .",
    "the evolution of binary orbital parameters through encounters with other systems is termed _ stimulated evolution_. during the initial few crossing times the weakly bound binary systems are disrupted which can cool the cluster ( kpm ) .",
    "this occurs for those binaries that have a binding energy , @xmath30 , smaller than the average kinetic energy of the cluster stars , @xmath31 .",
    "binaries with @xmath32 , on the other hand , are _ hard _ , and on average they harden further through interactions with cluster stars thereby heating the cluster ( heggie 1975 ) . at any time , binaries near the _ hard / soft _ boundary , with periods @xmath33 denoting the _ thermal period _ , are most active in the energy exchange between the cluster field and the binary population .",
    "the cluster expands as a result of binary heating and mass segregation ( see below ) , and the hard / soft boundary , @xmath34 , shifts to longer periods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stev ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , binaries with @xmath35 continue to be disrupted while @xmath34 keeps shifting to longer periods .",
    "this process ends when @xmath36 , which is the cutoff or maximum period in the surviving period distribution . at this critical time ,",
    "@xmath37 , further cluster expansion can be reduced since the population of heating sources , i.e. the binaries with @xmath33 , is significantly reduced .",
    "the details strongly depend on the initial value of @xmath38 by determining the amount of binding energy in soft binaries which can cool the cluster if significant enough .",
    "stimulated evolution also leads to a depletion of the _ mass - ratio distribution _ at small values , but is not efficient enough to thermalize the _ eccentricity distribution _ , requiring binaries to form with the observed thermal eccentricity distribution ( kroupa 1995 ) .",
    "after the critical time , @xmath37 , the expanded cluster has reached a temporary state of thermal equilibrium , and further stimulated evolution will occur with a significantly reduced rate determined by the velocity dispersion in the cluster , the cross section given by the semi - major axis of the binaries , and their number density and that of single stars in the cluster . stimulated evolution during this slow phase will usually involve partner exchanges and unstable but also long - lived _",
    "hierarchical systems_. the _ imf _ is critically important for this stage , as the initial number of massive stars determines the cluster density at @xmath39  myr .",
    "further binary depletion will occur once the cluster goes into core - collapse and the kinetic energy in the core rises .",
    "this phase of advanced cluster evolution is , however , not addressed here .",
    "[ fig : ftot ] illustrates the evolution of the binary proportion .",
    "all systems are counted within and outside the clusters .",
    "initially , the binary proportion decays on the crossing time - scale , but slows significantly in all cases after @xmath40  myr @xmath41 . _",
    "the value of @xmath42 is remembered by 150  myr for the same imf_. however , for model  100f10 @xmath43 crosses over to the @xmath44 cases ( models  8f06 and 30f06 ) which is due to the smaller number of massive stars .",
    "cluster expansion owing to stellar evolutionary mass loss is lessened in model  100f10 , and consequently , the clusters retain a higher density .",
    "stimulated evolution also leads to the generation of binary systems with _",
    "forbidden orbits_. these binaries have an eccentricity , @xmath45 , that places them above or to the left of the upper envelope in @xmath46 diagrams evident in binary populations ( kroupa 1995 ) .",
    "forbidden orbits are expected to circularise ( i.e. _ eigenevolve _ ) rapidly .",
    "this can lead to coalescence in some cases , but when @xmath47 after an encounter , the two stars can collide and merge within an orbital period . since the cross section for encounters is much larger for binaries than for single stars , this channel leading to _ stellar collisions _",
    "will dominate throughout the cluster life - time , possibly leading to exotic very massive stars in the early phase and/or blue stragglers in older clusters .",
    "this is also discussed by portegies - zwart ( 2000 ) for clusters with extraordinarily high central densities and assuming stars stick once they touch .",
    "a more conservative approach is taken here by counting the number of forbidden orbits , @xmath48 , present at discrete time - intervals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that larger @xmath42 leads to larger @xmath49 , and that @xmath48 increases significantly during @xmath50 .",
    "after this time , the generation of further forbidden orbits is reduced , and @xmath48 is about 0.3  % of the initial number of systems when @xmath44 , but about 0.7  % when @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum in @xmath48 for @xmath52  myr when @xmath53 is interesting , but remains to be investigated .",
    "three mechanisms drive internal cluster evolution : ( i ) energy equipartition ( two - body relaxation ) , ( ii ) binary star activity , and ( iii ) stellar evolution . fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] illustrates the evolution of the central number density , which is defined by the number of stars within the central radius of 0.1  pc .",
    "the central number density decreases on the relaxation time - scale .",
    "it also decreases for the clusters with @xmath54 .",
    "this is due to the shedding of binding energy , gained by the massive stars as they rapidly sink to the cluster centre as a result of energy equipartition , to the cluster field .",
    "the central average mass increases by a factor of  2 within  1  myr , and a factor of  4 by  2  myr , in clusters with the salpeter imf above @xmath55 , independently of the binary proportion .",
    "the cluster ( 100f10 ) with the steeper imf for massive stars also shows a linear increase of the central average mass , but the rate of increase is a factor of  2 slower .",
    "returning to the central number density , the clusters with @xmath29 expand at a faster rate than the single - star clusters , which is due to heating from the significant binary population .",
    "the higher density in model  30f10 ( thick solid line ) than in model  30f06 ( medium solid line ) for @xmath56  myr is significant and stems from the _ cooling _ of the cluster through disrupting wide binaries in  30f10 .",
    "this effect is seen in reverse in models  8f@xmath57 ( thick and medium dashed lines ) because the initially smaller @xmath9 makes more of the binary population effectively hard , thus leading to more heating in the case @xmath51 . the overall bulk evolution is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : rtrh ] .",
    "the tidal radius , @xmath58 , decreases as stars escape , and @xmath8 increases owing to cluster expansion .",
    "the clusters composed of single stars only ( 8f00 , 30f00 ) expand at a slower rate because binary - heating is not effective .",
    "only the models with @xmath59 stars loose approximately 50  % of their mass within about 150  myr .",
    "owing to the rapid onset of _ mass segregation _ , stars and systems with lower mass have , on average , larger radii than those with higher mass .",
    "in particular , the calculations show that _ brown dwarfs _ have the largest mean radius and are preferentially lost from the cluster",
    ". however , not only low - mass stars escape .",
    "the massive stars sink to the cluster core on a time - scale given roughly by @xmath60 which is @xmath61 for the cases studied here .",
    "the massive stars interact energetically with each other , often leading to their ejection .",
    "many calculations show two  o and/or  b stars leaving a cluster in opposite directions .",
    "this occurs if at least one of the stars is a binary system that gains binding energy and propels itself and the other star out of the cluster .",
    "[ fig : nesc ] shows the ratio @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of stars with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the number of such stars remaining in the calculation ( @xmath67 if @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus , between about  5 and 50  myr , 1050  % of all massive stars are found at distances larger than @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rtrh ] ) .",
    "this has significant implications for studies of the imf in young clusters , as well as in the field .",
    "the figure also shows that there is no significant difference between the cluster models",
    ". however , more massive clusters have a larger @xmath58 , so that it takes longer for stars with equal velocity to reach @xmath70 for massive clusters .",
    "binary  binary and binary  single - star interactions dominate the dynamical evolution during the first few crossing times , during which time the population of soft binaries is depleted significantly , and binaries near the hard / soft boundary contribute to cluster heating .",
    "the rapid sinking of the most massive stars to the centre of the cluster , on a time - scale which is a small fraction of the relaxation time , also leads to cluster heating and consequently cluster expansion .",
    "about  0.3 and 0.7  % of the initial number of systems for @xmath44 and  1 , respectively , are hardened sufficiently during an encounter such that efficient circularisation sets in .",
    "a fraction of such binaries will have their constituent stars collide .",
    "massive stars are readily ejected from the cluster cores , and between  10 and 50  % of  o and  b stars are located further than @xmath69 from their clusters between about  5 and  50  myr . the redistribution of binding and kinetic energy leads to cluster expansion , and the central density falls on a relaxation time - scale .",
    "after about 4  myr the massive stars that remain in the cluster start evolving significantly , and their combined mass loss leads to further cluster expansion which increases the evolution time - scale of the cluster .",
    "the number of massive stars , and thus the imf , is critical in determining the expansion of the cluster during this phase , and by how much the primordial binary population is eroded during the first 150  myr .",
    "the proportion of primordial binary systems that survive the first 150  myr , in clusters that initially have a central number density such as in the orion nebula cluster , is 34  and 43  % for @xmath44 and  1 , respectively , for a salpeter imf ( @xmath12 ) above @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath17 for @xmath14 , then @xmath71 despite @xmath51 . finally , the brown dwarf population lies at a larger average radius than more massive stars during cluster evolution .",
    "the results presented here are preliminary in that a larger model library is being completed now , and the formidable data reduction is being advanced .",
    "many questions remain to be answered . in particular",
    ", the effect of gas ejection from a newly fledged cluster needs to be addressed .",

    "this estimate is @xmath72 which can be , formally , shorter than @xmath73 .",
