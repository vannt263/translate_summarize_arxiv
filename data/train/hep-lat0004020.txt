    "( [ eq : psibarpsi ] ) suggests the existence of a drop in the signal of @xmath0 across @xmath17 also for the full qcd case  @xcite , ( see also  @xcite ) .    in the present paper we will present a lattice determination of @xmath0 in full qcd for @xmath18 degenerate flavours of staggered fermions at finite and zero temperature and for @xmath19 at finite temperature .",

    "notice that this procedure is equivalent to imposing the continuum value for the 1instanton charge ( in the @xmath39 scheme it is + 1 ) and extracting the finite multiplicative renormalization @xmath26 by evaluating a matrix element of @xmath32 .",
    "the additive renormalization @xmath35 is obtained in a similar way .",
