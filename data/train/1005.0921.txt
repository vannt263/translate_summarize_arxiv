    "the literature about shape comparison often reports distances or pseudo - distances whose definitions are based on considering sets of correspondences between topological spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where a correspondence is defined as a surjective relation @xmath6 such that also @xmath7 is surjective @xcite . in plain words , each correspondence describes a ( perceptive ) matching between the points of @xmath4 and the points of @xmath5 .    as a classical example , the _ hausdorff distance _ @xmath8 between two non - empty compact sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 of a metric space @xmath9 is defined as the value @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the set of all correspondences between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the _ gromov - hausdorff pseudo - distance _ @xcite and the _ frchet pseudo - distance _ @xcite represent two other well - known examples where a similar procedure is applied .",
    "sometimes ( as in the case of the frchet pseudo - distance ) just a proper subset of the set of all correspondences is considered .",
    "all these examples share the property of being defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a suitable functional taking each correspondence @xmath2 to a value that measures how much `` @xmath2 behaves as an identity '' from the point of view of our shape comparison . in the case of the hausdorff distance",
    ", @xmath12 equals the value @xmath13 , which vanishes if and only if @xmath14 and @xmath2 is the identity correspondence .    in persistent topology",
    "the same procedure leads to the concept of _ natural pseudo - distance _ , considering only correspondences that are also homeomorphisms .",
    "when two closed @xmath15 manifolds @xmath16 endowed with two continuous functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 are considered together with the set @xmath19 of all homeomorphisms between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , this extended pseudo - distance is defined to be either the value @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , depending on whether @xmath4 and @xmath5 are homeomorphic or not @xcite .",
    "we observe that the sets of correspondences considered in our examples include all homeomorphisms , which are always assumed to be legitimate transformations .",
    "unfortunately , in all the previous examples at least one of the following problems occurs : ( 1 ) the composition of relations does not pass to the limit ; ( 2 ) the infimum of the functional @xmath1 is not a minimum .",
    "consequently , a natural goal would be to guarantee that our functional attains a minimum by extending the metric space of the homeomorphisms between two any topological spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 to a compact metric space whose elements are ( possibly but not necessarily ) correspondences , endowed with a composition that extends the usual composition of homeomorphisms and passes to the limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is proving that this goal can not be reached even in the case @xmath14 , under pretty reasonable hypotheses .",
    "this fact suggests the existence of obstacles in treating , exclusively in terms of correspondences , the distances defined as @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 any small category ( i.e. any category @xmath22 such that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are actually sets ) having the following properties :    1 .",
    "its objects are topological spaces ; 2 .",
    "each ( possibly empty ) set of morphisms @xmath25 between two objects @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a subset of the set of correspondences from @xmath4 onto @xmath5 , containing all the possible homeomorphisms from @xmath4 onto @xmath5 ; 3 .   if @xmath26 then @xmath27 .",
    "varying @xmath28 in the set @xmath29 , let us consider a family of functionals @xmath30 satisfying the following properties :    1 .   for every @xmath26 , @xmath31 ; 2 .   if @xmath32 is the identity morphism on @xmath4 , then @xmath33 ; 3 .   for every @xmath26 , @xmath34 ; 4 .   if @xmath26 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the family of functionals @xmath37 allows us to define an extended pseudo - distance on @xmath23 ( we omit the trivial proof ) .",
    "the term _ extended _ means that the pseudo - distance can take the value @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , passing to the quotient , any pseudo - distance becomes a distance ( i.e. also the axiom @xmath38 is satisfied ) .",
    "the function @xmath39 is an extended pseudo - distance on @xmath23 .",
    "the previous setting allows us to obtain the pseudo - distances we have recalled at the beginning of the introduction , as particular cases .",
    "+ * hausdorff distance*. @xmath22 is the category whose objects are the non - empty compact subsets of a metric space @xmath9 .",
    "the morphisms are all correspondences between any two objects .",

    "the morphisms are given by all correspondences between objects .",
    "for every @xmath41 and @xmath26 , we set @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ranges over all metric spaces , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 range over all possible isometric embeddings of @xmath4 and @xmath5 into @xmath46 , respectively . + * frchet pseudo - distance*. @xmath22 is the category whose objects are all the curves @xmath47\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] ( seen as subsets of @xmath48\\times \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] endowed with the product topology ) .",

    "they are seen as subsets of @xmath56 , endowed with the product topology .",
    "the morphisms between two functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 are given by the homeomorphisms @xmath57 from @xmath4 onto @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we set @xmath58 .",
    "the core of this paper is the following result stating that we can not enlarge the set of homeomorphisms to a larger metric space @xmath3 , in such a way that the composition in @xmath3 ( extending the composition of homeomorphisms ) passes to the limit and , at the same time , @xmath3 is compact .",
    "since the passage to the limit of the composition is important in applications because of the need for computational approximations , our result suggests that there is no sensible way to extend the set of homeomorphisms to a larger compact metric space .",
    "[ result ] let @xmath4 be a topological space containing a subset @xmath59 that is homeomorphic to an @xmath55-dimensional open ball for some @xmath60 .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath61 of all homeomorphisms from @xmath4 onto @xmath4 , endowed with a metric @xmath62 that is compatible with the topology of @xmath4 in the sense of the following property : if a sequence @xmath63 in @xmath61 converges to the identical homeomorphism @xmath64 with respect to @xmath62 , then @xmath63 pointwise converges to @xmath32 with respect to the topology of @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath65 for every @xmath66 )",
    ". then no compact metric space @xmath67 exists , endowed with an internal composition @xmath68 such that :    1 .",
    "[ 1 ] @xmath69 ; 2 .   [ 2 ] @xmath70 extends @xmath62 ( i.e. if @xmath71 then @xmath72 ) ; 3 .   [ 3 ] the binary operation @xmath73 extends the usual composition of homeomorphisms ( i.e. , if @xmath71 then @xmath74 ) ; 4 .   [ 4 ] the composition @xmath73 commutes with the passage to the limit ( i.e. if the sequences @xmath75 and @xmath76 converge in @xmath3 , then @xmath77 exists and equals @xmath78 ) .",
    "let us prove our result by contradiction , assuming that such a metric space @xmath67 exists .",
    "for every homeomorphism @xmath79 and any natural number @xmath80 , let @xmath81 denote the composition of @xmath44 with itself @xmath82 times ( while @xmath83 ) , and let us set @xmath84 . since @xmath3 is compact , a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers @xmath85 exists such that both the limits , with respect to @xmath70 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 exist .",
    "therefore , recalling properties 1 and 2 , we have that the sequence of homeomorphisms @xmath90 converges to the identical homeomorphism , with respect to both @xmath62 and @xmath70 .",
    "we observe that each index @xmath91 is strictly positive .",
    "in other words , we have proved that for every homeomorphism @xmath44 from @xmath4 onto @xmath4 a sequence of positive numbers @xmath92 exists , such that @xmath93 converges to the identical homeomorphism with respect to @xmath62 .    in order to obtain a contradiction , it is sufficient to construct a homeomorphism @xmath57 that can not verify the previous property .",
    "we can do that by considering a homeomorphism @xmath94 , and constructing a homeomorphism @xmath95 that takes the set @xmath96 into the set @xmath97 .",
    "it is immediate to check that no sequence of non - trivial positive powers of @xmath57 can pointwise converge to the identical homeomorphism .",
    "therefore , no such a sequence can converge to the identical homeomorphism with respect to @xmath62 .",
