    "some x - ray pulsars are known to have remarkable similarity in their properties which are different from other binary or isolated x - ray pulsars ( @xcite ) .",

    "the sources also have a galactic distribution , most of these are within @xmath7 and all are probably young ( @xmath8 yr ) because of their association with snr or molecular clouds",
    ". the objects in which all the properties mentioned above have been observed are 4u  0142 + 61 , 1e  2259 + 586 , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 and 1e  1841@xmath0045 ( kes  73 ) .",
    "two more objects , ax  j1845.0@xmath00300 ( @xcite ) and rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ( @xcite ) , also probably belong to the same class but to establish their axp candidacy , more x - ray observations are required to measure their pulse period variations , search for possible pulse arrival time delay and investigate the flux stability .",
    "classification of an object as axp only from some properties similar to the above is not very firm .",
    "4u  1626@xmath067 , probably a binary system , showed both spin - up and spin - down ( @xcite ) and also has an optically bright accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "another one object rx  j1838.4@xmath00301 ( @xcite ) , does not have stable intensity and pulsations are also not always detectable ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , these two objects are not axps .    considering the strong similarity between these handful of sources",
    ", it has been proposed that they have same physical nature and different scenarios have been proposed to explain the observed properties .",
    "the prominent models are a ) accretion from low mass binary companion ( @xcite ) , b ) single neutron star accreting from molecular cloud , or a product of common envelope evolution ( thorne-@xmath9ytkov object ) of close high mass x - ray binaries in which a solitary neutron star accretes matter from a fossil disk ( van paradijs , taam , & van den heuvel @xcite ; ghosh , angelini , & white @xcite ) , and c ) extremely high magnetic field neutron star radiating x - rays due to magnetic field decay ( @xcite ) .",
    "unlike the radio pulsars and rotationally powered x - ray pulsars , in the axps , the spin - down rate is not large enough to power the observed x - ray emission .    among",
    "the 90 or so known x - ray pulsars ( @xcite ) , direct evidence of binary nature is known for more than 35 sources ( @xcite ) . including the indirect evidences this number can be upto about 65 and 7 pulsars are isolated stars in snr and",
    "are powered by rotational energy losses . in the rest of the pulsars , in which no binary signature is known",
    ", it is often due to lack of sufficient observation .",
    "however , the 7 objects which are either axps or candidate axps ( or 10 if we include the 3 soft gamma - ray repeaters in which pulsations have been detected ) , no binary signature has been found in spite of extensive searches .",
    "the strong upper limit on pulse arrival time delay that has been obtained in some of these sources strongly suggests non - binary nature for the axps .",
    "in addition , the spin change behaviour of the axps is also remarkably different from accreting pulsars ( @xcite ) . in almost all the accreting x - ray pulsars , both spin - up and spin - down episodes",
    "have been seen which may be randomly distributed ( in persistent sources ) or spin - downs in quiescence followed by rapid spin - ups during bright transient phases ( in transient pulsars ) or long monotonic spin - up and spin - down episodes accompanied by spectral and luminosity changes ( e.g. 4u  1626@xmath067 , @xcite ) .",
    "the axps are in many respect also similar to the x - ray counterparts of the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) .",
    "the x - ray spectral and timing properties of these two type of objects have strong similarities , half of the axps and sgrs are associated with supernova remnants .",
    "this has lead to the suggestion that the axps are also magnetars in which the x - ray emission is due to magnetic field decay ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between these two type of objects is the non detection of sgr bursts from the axps .",
    "however , considering the rarity of the sgr activity among the established sgrs ( @xcite ) , the absence of bursts from axps is not a serious issue . from a relatively young age of the axp ,",
    "1e  1841@xmath0045 in the supernova remnant kes  73 , gotthelf , vasisht , & dotani ( @xcite ) proposed that in the evolutionary track , the axps are an early quiescent state of the sgrs .",
    "stability of the x - ray emission properties ( spin - down rate , luminosity , spectral shape and pulse shape and fraction ) is usually mentioned as one important aspect of the axps though one has to compare between observations made with different instruments for which the energy band , energy resolution and sensitivity are not identical . to make a rigorous comparison in the stability of the x - ray emission properties we have made new observations of two axps with the _ asca _ , four years after two previous observations reported by @xcite and corbet & mihara ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim was to critically examine the stability of the x - ray emission pattern and more pulse period measurements which may provide support to either the accretion powered or the magnetar hypothesis for these objects .",
    "the source 4u  0142 + 61  is close to a long period binary pulsar rx j0146.9 + 6121 and in the _ exosat _",

    ", the 8.7 s pulsations in this source were detected only in the 1.04.0 kev range .",
    "a binary nature of the system was preferred in spite of a large x - ray to optical flux ratio and absence of pulse arrival time delay .",
    "the source was subsequently observed with _ rosat _  and",
    "the pulse period was found to be very close to the _ exosat _  measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ asca _  observation in 1994 confirmed the steady spin - down trend and defined the spectral character clearly .",
    "a model consisting a 0.4 kev blackbody and a power law with a photon index of 3.7 was found to describe the spectrum well . from a small radius of a few km of the black body emission zone ( which probably is on the surface of the neutron star )",
    "@xcite suggested that the black - body component is more likely to be due to a spherical accretion rather than accretion from a disk .",
    "a small pulse fraction and energy dependent pulse profile , double peak at low energy and single peak at high energy is characteristic of this pulsar . from _",
    "rxte_observations , the upper limit on the pulse arrival time delay was determined to be 260 ms in the 70 s to 2.5 days range thereby ruling out all types of binary companions except white dwarf or low mass he main sequence star ( @xcite ) .",

    "observations spanning 20 years during 19791998 , with the _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ bepposax _  and _ rxte _  show an overall constant spin - down trend with @xmath10 s s@xmath6 .",
    "pulsations in the source 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  were discovered from observations with the _ einstein _  observatory in 1979 and was confirmed by _ exosat _",

    "the energy spectrum was found to be a power - law type ( @xmath11 = 2.26 ) with low energy absorption ( n@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 ) . the relatively harder power - law spectrum and a candidate optical counterpart lead to the speculation that this can be a be star binary .",

    "subsequent _ rosat _",
    "observations however revealed an increase in the spin - down rate which is remarkably different from other established axps ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low energy part of the spectrum was first accurately measured with the _ asca _  in 1994 ( corbet & mihara @xcite ) .",
    "however , it could not distinguish between power - law ( @xmath15 ) and a combination of power - law ( @xmath11 = 2.0 ) and black - body ( kt = 0.55 kev ) . during the _ rosat _  and the _ asca _  observations , the spin - down rate remained at a higher level of @xmath16 s s@xmath6 .",
    "a decrease in intensity by a factor of 3 compared to the _ exosat _  observation was also noticed .",
    "_ bepposax _  observation in 1997 showed that a combined black - body and power - law model fits the data well .",
    "the size of the black - body emission zone was found to be of the order of km@xmath17 , identical to other axps ( @xcite ) .",
    "compared to other axps , the pulse fraction was found to be much larger ( @xmath18 65% ) in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  and has little energy dependence .",
    "the power - law component is also relatively harder ( @xmath19 ) compared to the other axps ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "observations in 199697 showed yet another change in the spin down rate , now close to that in 1980 s .",
    "long _ rxte _  observations established a small upper limit of 60 ms for any pulse arrival time delay for orbital period in the range of 200 s to 1.5 days .",
    "based on this , any binary companion other than low mass helium burning star in a face on system has been ruled out ( @xcite ) .",

    "for the two observations of 4u  0142 + 61 , the source photons were extracted from circular regions of radius 6 arc min and 4 arc min around the source for gis and sis respectively . in the case of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ,",
    "the source photons were extracted from relatively smaller regions of 5 and 3 arc min respectively . for sis ,",
    "the background spectra were accumulated from the whole chip excluding a circular region around the source and for gis it was collected from regions diametrically opposite to the source location in the field of view .      to calculate the pulse periods accurately ,",
    "barycentric correction was applied to the arrival time of each photon and light curves were extracted from the pair of gis detectors with a time resolution of 0.5 s in the energy band of 0.5 - 10.0 kev .",
    "epoch folding method was applied to obtain the pulse periods approximately and templates for the pulse profiles were created by folding the light curves at the approximate pulse periods .",
    "subsequently , the light curves were divided into eight segments of equal length and pulse profiles were created from each of these segments by applying the same epoch and pulsation period .",
    "the relative phases of the pulses were then evaluated by cross correlating the pulse profiles with the respective templates .",
    "a linear fit to the relative phases with their pulse numbers gave the correction necessary to obtain the accurate pulse period .",

    "it therefore can be concluded that the recent _ asca_measurement together with the previous results is consistent with a constant spin - down rate .",

    "the flux measurements from the previous observations as shown in the bottom panel of figure 6 are about a factor 3 higher than the recent measurements with _ asca _  and _ bepposax_. we note that there is some overestimation in extrapolation of the soft x - ray measurements with _ einstein _  and _ rosat _  due to a smaller photon index used , and the flux estimates from _ exosat _  and _ ginga _  could be overestimated due to contribution from the nearby bright and variable source @xmath46-carina , which is only 0.4@xmath22 away and is about 15 times brighter than 1e  1048.1@xmath05937(@xcite ; @xcite ) . in view of the stability of the flux during 19941998 , as obtained from the imaging instruments _ asca _  and _ bepposax _ , it is possible that the overall intensity of this source does not vary at a few years times scale .",

    "all the sources need to have disk accretion rate a tiny fraction larger than the propeller regime . @xcite",
    "have identified several other problems in the context of applicability of this model to the axps .",
    "most notable is the limited lifetime of an accretion disk around a solitary neutron star compared to the response time scale of the neutron star to changes in the accretion torque .",
    "one possible alternative is that the spin - down is due to magnetically driven wind from an accretion disk , proposed also for sgr  1900 + 14  ( @xcite ) , but this will require a harder x - ray spectrum than what has been observed .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario in which the axps are formed as single neutron stars with fossil disks made from fallback material from the supernovae explosions . in this model ,",
    "the spin - down from an initial period of a few ms to @xmath186 s is due to strong propeller effect at some period when the accretion rate is very low .",
    "but , if accretion is the correct phenomenon in the axps , as high spin - down goes on in presence of substantial accretion , spin - down due to wind outflow seems to be more plausible than accretion induced angular momentum loss .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the classical equilibrium disk picture assumed here is often found not to be the most appropriate description for the x - ray pulsars ( @xcite ) .      in view of a very narrow mass and type allowed for any binary companion , and several arguments against the common envelope evolution model",
    ", the magnetar model seems to be the most likely one for the axps .",
    "if the spin - down is due to magnetic braking , dipole field strength of the order of @xmath68 gauss is estimated for these sources .",

    "@xcite ) , and 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 ( kaspi , chakrabarty & steinberger @xcite ) , there is very strong evidence for constant spin - down , whereas in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , deviation from a linear trend is clear .",
    "recently , a deviation has also been detected from sgr  1900 + 14(woods et al .",
    "@xcite ) . 1e  2259 + 586 , the most frequently observed axp , has provided an interesting pulse period history .",
    "observations made for about 15 years with many instruments preceding _ rxte _  showed considerable variation in the spin - down rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "but , the pulse - coherent timing observations with _ rxte",
    "_  proved it to be otherwise , at least for a period of last 2.6 yr ( kaspi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed which can explain the changing spin - down rate even when the overall braking is due to the ultrastrong magnetic field .",
    "@xcite showed that for reasonable neutron star parameters , a radiative precession effect may take place which can give the observed spin - down variations with time scale of about 10 years .",
    "it will be possible to verify this scenario when more pulse period measurements become available in the next few years .",
    "woods et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have identified a possible _ braking glitch _ in sgr  1900 + 14  close to the time when sgr activity was very strong .",
    "but if the spin - down variation is related to the sgr activity , similar activities should have been observed from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  and 1e 2259 + 586 . we have found that all the gamma ray bursts observed with the batse for which the estimated positions are within @xmath69 of these axps ( about 30 grbs around each axp ) , have strong high energy emission unlike the sgr bursts .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the spin - down variations can be explained as glitches ( similar to radio pulsars ) superposed on constant spin - down .",
    "but , with recent pulse period measurements of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  and sgr  1900 + 14 , this will require too many glitches , one before almost every observation unless there are _ braking glitches _ , never observed in radio pulsars .    in the magnetar model ,",
    "the x - ray emission is due to decay of the magnetic field .",
    "the energy generated at the core is transported to the crust along the magnetic field direction .",
    "the black body component of the spectrum is thermal emission from the hot spots at the magnetic polar regions and the power - law component is part of the thermal emission reprocessed by the magnetic field and the environment .",
    "investigation is required about the expected pulse profile and its energy dependence .",
    "time and/or energy dependence of the pulse profile as has been observed in sgr  1806@xmath020(@xcite ) and sgr  1900 + 14  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) also requires to be addressed .",
    "a double peaked pulse profile at low energy and single peaked profile at high energy are observed in 4u  0142 + 61  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the pulsation is very weak in some sources ( only 510@xmath70 in sgr  1806@xmath020  and 4u  0142 + 61 ) , and 75@xmath70 in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 . if the pulsation is due to confinement of the heat in the magnetic polar regions by the magnetic field , a correlation between magnetic field strength and pulse fraction should be observed .",
    "but , it is likely to be smeared by the geometric effect of individual sources , i.e. the orientation of the spin and magnetic axes with respect to the line of sight . in the magnetar model",
    ", there are two mechanisms by which x - rays can be generated .",
    "if the x - ray emission is powered by decaying magnetic field , the luminosity is a very strong function of the magnetic field strength , @xmath71 ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternate process of x - ray generation is particle acceleration by alfven waves resulting from small scale fracture of the crust , in this case @xmath72 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and pulse fraction of five confirmed axps and two sgr sources are shown in figure 7 . against the magnetic field strength .",
    "the later is estimated from pulse period and the overall spin - down rate assuming @xmath73 gauss . though there is uncertainty in the luminosity of some sources ( see the caption of figure 7 ) ,",
    "a 2nd or 4th power correlation between @xmath74 and b does not seem to be present .",
    "there is also no correlation between pulse fraction and the magnetic field .",
    "a clustering of the pulse period of 10 sources ( 7 axps and 3 sgrs ) in the 512 s range also needs to be addressed , when the magnetars are expected to be alive in x - ray until they have slowed down to a pulse period of about 70 s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetars are expected to be radio quiet due to suppression of pair creation at high magnetic field ( @xcite ) , and this seems to be true for most sources .",
    "changes in luminosity or small changes in the spectral parameters can be a result of varying activities in the core , the heat generated from which is transported to the surface along the direction of the magnetic field at time scale of a few years .",
    "variability study of axps with very high sensitivity may rule out magnetar model if significant change in column density is observed .",
    "this will indicate the presence of accretion disk and wind in the neighbouring area .",
    "the _ bepposax _  and _ asca _",
    "observations give identical column density for 4u  0142 + 61  but slightly different column density in case of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "however , multiple observation of the later source with the same instrument is found to give identical value indicating that the difference between the two instruments can also be a systematic effect .",
    "using multiple observations of two axps with the _ _ asca _ _ we have found remarkable stability in the intensity , spectral shape and pulse profile over a 4 years period .",
    "for the source 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , we have confirmed that similar to other axps , the spectrum consists of a power - law component and a black body component .",
    "the spin - down trend of 4u  0142 + 61  is consistent with a constant rate whereas in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  we have clearly identified three different spin - down epochs .",
    "we have shown that the fast spin - down of some of the axps is difficult to achieve with disk accretion .",
    "hence the common envelope evolution scenario of axps is unlikely to be the case , unless the spin - down is due to wind outflow from the disk . in this case",
    "also , the stability of x - ray emission in spite of varying spin - down rate remains unexplained .",
    "the significantly different spin - down rates of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  in different epochs are also difficult to reconcile in the magnetar model , unless precession is at work .",
    "but the flux stability and lack of variation of the spectral parameters appear to favour the magnetar model .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for many suggestions which helped to improve a previous version of the manuscript .",
