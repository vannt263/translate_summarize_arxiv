    "law of large numbers plays an important role in statistical physics . in stationary stochastic processes @xmath0 , law of large numbers or the central limit theorem tells us that time - averaged observables such as diffusivity and the ratio of occupation time converge to a constant when the measurement time goes to infinity : @xmath1 where the observable @xmath2 is a function of the stochastic process @xmath0 . in experiments ,",
