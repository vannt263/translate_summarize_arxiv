    "the picasso experiment ( project in canada to search for super - symmetric objects ) searches for cold dark matter through the direct detection of neutralinos via their _ spin - dependent _ ( sd ) interactions with @xmath0f nuclei @xcite .",
    "the use of the light target nucleus @xmath0f , together with a low detection threshold of 2 kev for recoil nuclei makes picasso particularly sensitive to low - mass wimps .",
    "this is important as few experiments are sensitive below 15 gevc@xmath6 and it is precisely in this mass range where recent interpretations of the dama / libra annual modulations in terms of sd interactions remain partially unchecked @xcite .",
    "+ the elastic spin - dependent ( sd ) cross section for wimp scattering at tree level and zero momentum transfer has the form @xcite @xmath7 where g@xmath8 is the fermi constant , m@xmath9 and m@xmath10 are the masses of the wimp and the target nucleus , a@xmath11 are the effective proton ( neutron ) coupling strengths , @xmath12 are the expectation values of the proton ( neutron ) spins in the target nucleus and j is the nuclear spin .",
    "+ with the exception of neutralino scattering on free protons , @xmath0f is one of the most favourable target nuclei for the direct detection of sd interactions @xcite .",
    "as measurements and shell model calculations of nuclear magnetic moments show , the spin s@xmath13 of the @xmath0f nucleus is carried almost exclusively by its unpaired proton ( e.g. @xmath14 = 0.441 and @xmath15 = -0.109 in @xcite ) , which enhances the spin - dependent cross section in @xmath0f by nearly an order of magnitude compared to other frequently used detector materials .",
    "fluorine is also complementary to other sd target isotopes like @xmath16na , @xmath17i and @xmath18xe in terms of the wimp - proton ( @xmath19 ) and wimp- neutron ( @xmath20 ) couplings .",
    "this is due to the negative sign in the ratio of the expectation values of the proton and neutron spins which leads to a different range of sensitivities in the @xmath19@xmath20 plane @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of the picasso project at snolab is to exploit the favourable properties of @xmath0f by using c@xmath21f@xmath22 as target material and by employing the superheated droplet detection technique , which is based on the operation principle of the classic bubble chamber @xcite .",
    "other dark matter experiments based on similar techniques are simple , using droplets of c@xmath23clf@xmath24 and cf@xmath25i @xcite and coupp , which operates a bubble chamber filled with cf@xmath25i @xcite .",
    "previous physics results of our studies have been published in @xcite . in the meantime progress has been made in several areas and data are presently being taken with 32 detector modules with an increased active mass of @xmath0f of about 65 g per module , with lower intrinsic background and an increased droplet size ( section [ sec : det ] ) .",
    "new discrimination variables , derived from the signal wave forms have been discovered , which allow an efficient suppression of non - particle induced backgrounds ( section [ sec : disc ] ) . in this paper",
    "we report the first application of these new tools to a set of two detectors , resulting in competitive limits obtained with a relatively modest exposure ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the active detector material in picasso is liquid c@xmath21f@xmath22 , with a boiling temperature of t@xmath26 = -1.7@xmath27c at a pressure of 1.013 bar and a critical temperature of t@xmath28 = 113.3@xmath27c .",
    "the detector is formed by suspending droplets of c@xmath21f@xmath22 in an inactive polymerized gel matrix .",
    "the droplets are therefore in a metastable , superheated state at ambient temperature and pressure . in this condition a heat spike due to the energy deposited by an ionizing particle can cause the formation of a vapour bubble .",
    "this phase transition is explosive in nature and accompanied by an acoustic signal in the audible to ultrasonic frequency range .",
    "this can easily be registered by piezoelectric transducers .",
    "+ in order for a phase transition to occur , a particle has to deposit a minimum amount of energy e@xmath29 within a given length l@xmath29 .",
    "both , e@xmath29 and l@xmath29 , decrease exponentially with temperature and are functions of the surface tension at the liquid - vapour interface and the superheat , which is defined as the difference between the vapour pressure of the liquid and the smaller external pressure .",
    "details on the operation principle and the underlying thermodynamic model are described in @xcite . +",
    "if de / dx is the mean stopping power of incident particles , then the energy deposited along l@xmath29 is e@xmath30 = l@xmath29 @xmath31 de / dx and the condition for triggering a phase transition becomes e@xmath32 e@xmath29 .",
    "the dependence of the threshold energy e@xmath29 on temperature and pressure may be studied with neutron induced nuclear recoils . for this purpose",
    "extensive calibrations were performed at the montral tandem accelerator facility .",
    "the mono - energetic neutrons used for calibration were produced via nuclear reactions with mono - energetic protons via the @xmath33li(p , n)@xmath33be and @xmath34v(p , n)@xmath34cr reactions .",
    "the measurements with the li target cover a range of neutron energies from 100 kev up to 5 mev and the obtained results are discussed in detail in @xcite . with",
    "improved proton beam stability at the montral facility these calibrations could be recently extended with a @xmath34v target down to a neutron energy of 4.8 kev .",
    "+ in order to acquire sufficient statistics close to threshold the proton beam energies were tuned to one of the numerous resonances in the @xmath34v(p , n)@xmath34cr reaction cross section . in particular five resonances",
    "have been selected , each with a width smaller than one kev , yielding mono - energetic neutrons of e@xmath35 = 4.8 kev , 40 kev , 50 kev , 61 kev and 97 kev @xcite .",
    "the detectors used for these measurements were much smaller in size ( 30 ml ) but fabricated in the same way , especially with similar droplet diameters , as the standard detectors used in dark matter runs . for each selected neutron energy data",
    "were taken by ramping the temperature up and down for a given pressure .",
    "since close to threshold the cosmic ray induced n - background can amount to 50% of the total count rate , each neutron run at a fixed temperature was followed by a background run at the same temperature . for a fixed neutron energy the data have been normalized by the integrated proton current and the count rate of a @xmath36he counter mounted behind the target was used to compensate for short , off - resonance , beam energy fluctuations . for a given neutron energy the threshold temperature t@xmath29",

    "thermodynamic considerations require that the threshold curve rejoins e@xmath38(t@xmath39 ) = 0 kev at the critical temperature t@xmath39 and e@xmath38(t@xmath40 ) = @xmath41 kev at the boiling temperature t@xmath40 .",
    "the energy of @xmath0f recoils at threshold is then given by the relation : @xmath42 { \\rm ( kev)}\\ ] ] where the kinematic factor 0.19 relates the measured neutron energy to the corresponding maximum fluorine recoil energy .",
    "the error of 3% is largely due to the systematic errors in the temperature measurements during the test beam runs .",
    "+ the measurements at the lowest neutron energy ( e@xmath35 = 4.8 kev or e@xmath43 = 0.9 kev ) are particularly challenging since at threshold and above , the detector had to be operated between 48@xmath27c and 60 @xmath27c where c@xmath21f@xmath22 becomes sensitive to the 320 kev gamma rays ( t@xmath13 = 28 d ) following de - excitation of @xmath34cr .",
    "therefore this background had to be measured independently during a beam off period after each neutron run and subtracted from the data . since the detector is not sensitive to gamma - rays themselves , but rather to @xmath44 -electrons with energies smaller than a few kev produced on the tracks of compton scattered electrons @xcite , the observed gamma sensitivity affirms the very low energy thresholds attained at 50@xmath27c ( see also fig .",
    "the temperature range of operation in picasso with 18.5@xmath27c @xmath45 t @xmath45 45@xmath27c then translates ( in reversed order ) into sensitivities to @xmath0f recoils with energies in the range of 2.0 kev @xmath45 e@xmath8 @xmath45 200 kev .",
    "since each temperature corresponds to a well defined recoil energy threshold , the spectrum of the particle induced energy depositions can then be reconstructed by ramping the temperature .",
    "+ it was found moreover that the detection threshold is not a sharp step function , but rises gradually from threshold to full efficiency @xcite .",
    "the probability p(e@xmath30 , e@xmath29 ) , that an energy deposition e@xmath30 larger than the energy threshold e@xmath29 will generate a nucleation can be approximated by : @xmath46\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath47 describes the observed steepness of the threshold .",
    "this parameter is related to the intrinsic energy resolution and reflects the statistical nature of the energy deposition and its conversion into heat ; it has to be determined experimentally for each superheated liquid and for different particle species , respectively .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath48 corresponds to the best fit to the temperature response functions where the resonances were best defined .",
    "this new value is larger than our earlier quoted result of @xmath49 @xcite ; this is explained by the fact that now the @xmath47-parameter has been re - evaluated using simulations which take into account the low energy tail in the neutron beam profile due to scattering of neutrons off the environment of the detector area .",
    "it is thus normal that @xmath47 should have a larger value than when it was assumed that the neutron beam was a delta function .",
    "the new adopted value also reproduces best poly - energetic neutron source spectra and ( n@xmath29 , p ) - response functions for chlorine containing freons @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to still better define this parameter and in particular to investigate a suspected energy dependence . + complete simulations of the detector response to mono - energetic test beam neutrons and poly - energetic neutrons from an acbe source show that all data are in good agreement with the simulations and can be well described with a consistent set of the variables which parametrize the underlying model assumptions @xcite .",
    "the response to different kinds of particle interactions depends on the respective specific energy losses .",
    "examples are shown in fig.[fig:2 ] : wimp induced recoil energies of @xmath0f nuclei are expected to be smaller than 100 kev and therefore become detectable above 30@xmath27c . particles which produce only low ionization densities , such as cosmic ray muons , @xmath50 - and @xmath51 - rays are observed at temperatures above 50@xmath27c .",
    "they are well separated from the strongly ionizing neutron or wimp induced recoils , which allows an efficient suppression of such backgrounds at the level of 10@xmath52 to 10@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "+ alpha particles show a different behaviour .",
    "data obtained with @xmath54ra spiked detectors and detector modules with a significant contamination of u , th , or their daughters show that the sensitivity to alpha particles , which are contained entirely in the droplets , starts with a sharp step at 21@xmath27c ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . at higher temperatures",
    "the liquid becomes sensitive to smaller de / dx on the tracks and the recoiling daughter nucleus itself .",
    "however , since the detector is already fully sensitive to alpha particles immediately above threshold , the temperature response levels off in a plateau and the detector remains fully sensitive to alpha particles over the entire range of the wimp sensitivity . therefore ,",
    "since the shapes of the wimp and alpha curves differ substantially , the alpha background can be efficiently discriminated by measuring the temperature profile of the detector response .",

    "each detector is filled with 4.5 litres of polymerised emulsion loaded with droplets of c@xmath21f@xmath22 .",
    "the active part of each detector is topped by a 4 cm thick layer of mineral oil , which is connected to a hydraulic manifold .",
    "the typical distribution of the droplet sizes seen by neutrons or wimps ( i.e. weighted by droplet volume ) peaks at a diameter of 200 @xmath56 m with a variance of around 100 @xmath56 m .",
    "the mass of c@xmath21f@xmath22 in each detector is about 85 g , corresponding to 68 g of @xmath0f .",
    "it can be determined with a precision of 1% by weighing the detector components during the fabrication .",
    "additional uncertainties in the mass determination are attributed to inactive c@xmath21f@xmath22 , either due to diffusion of c@xmath21f@xmath22 into the gel ( @xmath45 1.7% ) or contained in microscopic droplets which might not be able to trigger ( @xmath45 1% ) .",
    "therefore after fabrication the detector loading is verified by a separate measurement in the known flux of an acbe neutron source with a combined statistical and systematic error of 5% .",

    "in addition to passive shielding against neutrons and gamma rays , dark matter experiments usually exploit specific features in the transients of the primary signal , such as pulse shape , or rise or decay times , in order to discriminate between nuclear recoils and other events .",
