    "numerical implementation of fresnel diffraction @xcite with fast fourier transform ( fft ) is widely used in optics , especially computer - generated holograms ( cgh ) and digital holography @xcite .",
    "cgh is a technique for generating a hologram pattern on a computer by simulating diffracted light from objects , and its applications include three - dimensional display and the design of optical elements .",
    "digital holography reconstructs the light of an object including the amplitude and phase on a computer from a hologram captured by imaging devices such ccd cameras .    in these fields ,",
    "fresnel diffraction and the angular spectrum method are used as key techniques",
    ". these diffraction calculation can be accelerated by fft - implemented convolution ; however it imposes the limitation that the sampling rate on a source plane is the same as that on a destination plane due to the property of fft .",
    "if we can change the sampling rate , we will be able to extend the applications of diffraction calculations .    in the angular spectrum method",
    ", some studies address different sampling rates on source and destination planes .",
    "reference @xcite proposed the scaled angular spectrum method using scaled - fft , which is one version of fft introducing a scaling parameter .",
    "this angular spectrum method requires four ffts .",
    "another one was proposed by us @xcite .",
    "our scaled angular spectrum method was implemented by non - uniform fft .",
    "this angular spectrum method requires two ffts and one interpolation .",
    "fresnel diffraction to address the scale operation has already been realized by some studies .",
    "double - step fresnel diffraction executes the scale operation by double fresnel diffraction calculations @xcite .",
    "shifted - fresnel diffraction addresses the shift and scale operations by scaled - fft @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite proposed the same method as the shifted - fresnel diffraction by bluestein transform . scaled - fft and bluestein transform are essentially the same .    in holography",
    ", the scale operation of shifted - fresnel diffraction @xcite is used in several applications : for example , wavefront - recording method @xcite for accelerating cgh generation , digital holographic microscopy observable at any magnification @xcite , and zoomable holographic projection without a zoom lens @xcite .",
    "shifted - fresnel diffraction yields new applications ; however , the calculations may incur a serious aliasing error in a short propagation distance and the aliasing error has not been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the aliasing conditions of shifted - fresnel diffraction and improve the problems incurred based on the conditions .",
    "the improved diffraction is referred as to aliasing - reduced shifted and scaled ( arss)-fresnel diffraction . in section 2 , we explain arss - fresnel diffraction . in section 3 ,",
    "we show a comparison of diffracted results between arss - fresnel diffraction and shifted - fresnel diffraction .",
    "section 4 concludes this work .",
    "fresnel diffraction is expressed by , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave number , @xmath2 is the wavelength of light , @xmath3 is the source plane , @xmath4 is the destination plane , and @xmath5 is the propagation distance between the source and destination planes .",
    "we derive arss - fresnel diffraction by the following relation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scaling parameter , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are integers with ranges of @xmath12 $ ] where @xmath13 is the number of sampling points .",
    "@xmath14 is the sampling rate on the destination plane and @xmath15 is offset from the origin .",
    "the sampling rate on the source plane is determined by @xmath16 .",
    "we can obtain the following equation by substituting the relation into eq.([eqn : fre ] ) : @xmath17    we can obtain arss - fresnel diffraction by using the convolution theorem and introducing the band - limiting function to reduce aliasing : @xmath18 }       { \\mathcal{f } \\biggl[\\exp(i \\phi_h ) { \\rm rect}(\\frac{x_h}{2 x_{max } } )   \\biggl ] }    \\biggl ] } \\label{eqn : arss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the rectangular function , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 $ ] ) , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined by , @xmath25    band - limitation function will be acceptable other than the rectangular function , for example , the circular function , window functions ( e.g. hanning and hamming window functions ) and so forth .",
    "it is straightforward way to extend to two - dimensional arss - fresnel diffraction because fresnel diffraction allows separation of variables .",
    "figure [ fig : sfre - ex ] shows the light intensity distributions calculated by shifted - fresnel diffraction @xcite .",
    "the calculation parameters are @xmath26 , @xmath27 nm and @xmath28 m. the sampling rates on the source and destination planes indicate @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath31 of figs [ fig : sfre - ex ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are @xmath32(@xmath29 and @xmath30 are 6 @xmath33 m ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "( b ) @xmath34 ( c ) @xmath35.,width=453 ]    as shown in the figure , shifted - fresnel diffraction can magnify diffracted results by the scaling parameter ; however , no countermeasure for aliasing has been devised .",
    "for instance , when changing @xmath5 from 0.1 m to 0.05 m and 0.03 m , the results are shown in fig.[fig : sfre - aliasing ] .",
    "the upper images show the real parts and the bottom images show the light intensity of shifted - fresnel diffraction . in the case of @xmath28 m ,",
    "the results have good quality without aliasing .",
    "however , in the cases of @xmath36 m and @xmath37 m , the results are extremely contaminated by aliasing .          although arss - fresnel diffraction is derived in a different way to shifted - fresnel diffraction , arss - fresnel diffraction of eq.([eqn : arss ] )",
    "is essentially the same as shifted - fresnel diffraction , except for the introduction of the band - limitation function . in this subsection",
    ", we clarify the aliasing conditions of arss - fresnel diffraction .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : arss ] ) involves three chirp functions , namely @xmath38 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the cause of aliasing is the chirp functions .",

    "the aliasing is not incurred in the chirp functions ; however , in the cases of @xmath37 m , @xmath41 and @xmath23 are contaminated by aliasing .",
    "m and @xmath37 m. , width=529 ]    therefore , we need to band - limit these functions .",
    "the aliasing - free areas of the chirp functions can be calculated by @xcite , @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44    from eqs.([eqn : freq_cz])-([eqn : freq_h ] ) , the aliasing - free areas in pixel units are as follows : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47    according to eq.([eqn : r_h ] ) , the band - limited chirp function of @xmath48 at @xmath37 m is shown in fig.[fig : zone ] .",
    "changing @xmath5 between 0.01 m and 0.25 m , fig.[fig : plot1 ] plots the aliasing - free areas in pixel units of the chirp functions under the calculation conditions of @xmath26 , @xmath39 , @xmath27 nm , @xmath40 m and @xmath35 . in the figure , the green , red , and light blue plots indicate the aliasing - free areas of @xmath23 , @xmath22 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the blue line indicates the half area ( @xmath49 ) of the source and destination planes .",
    "the aliasing is incurred when each plot falls below the blue line .    in fig.[fig : plot1](a ) , the effective distance without aliasing is over about 0.07 m because the chirp functions @xmath41 and @xmath50 do not incur aliasing over about 0.07 m , and we need to band - limit @xmath23 in about 300 pixels ( @xmath51 in eq.([eqn : arss ] ) ) .    in fig.[fig : plot1](b ) , the chirp functions @xmath22 and @xmath48 for @xmath52 m and @xmath53 do not incur aliasing over about 0.18 m , while @xmath41 still incurs aliasing at about 0.18 m. if we band - limit @xmath41 in the aliasing - free area of about 200 pixels , no aliasing is incurred ; however , the complex amplitude resulting in eq.([eqn : arss ] ) outside the aliasing - free area was eliminated because zero area of @xmath41 outside the aliasing - free area is multiplied with the result of inverse fft of eq.([eqn : arss ] ) .",
    "therefore , for complex amplitude , we need to satisfy the following relation to avoid aliasing : @xmath54    for light intensity , we need to satisfy the following relation to avoid aliasing : @xmath55 because the @xmath56 can be ignored in the light intensity .",
