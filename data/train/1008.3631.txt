    "ti equilateral bond length becomes 2.44  and ti  o bonds are 1.89  belonging to the tetragon while the two ti(iv ) s make four equidistant bonds with oxygens over the row reading 1.87  each .",
    "pt on reconstructed surface has the strongest binding energy of 3.94 ev / atom among the other system considered in this study .",
    "electronically , adsorbate driven atomic dislocations on the tio@xmath2(110 ) surface has a significant effect on its band structure .",
    "in particular , band edges are sensitive to any distortion on the ti@xmath2o@xmath7 construction .",
    "for example , single pt atom adsorption changes the valence and conduction band edges and offsets of the reconstructed rutile surface when we compare the corresponding dos structures of ar - tio@xmath2(110 ) systems with and without pt atom in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for an isolated pt ,",
    "fermi energy occurs at 0.85 ev above the vbm due to upper lying gap state .",
    "the band gap is widened by 0.92 ev in comparison to that of the clean reconstructed ( 1@xmath52 ) surface .",

    "[ fig7 ] for the majority - spin component .",
    "the states associated to these saturated dangling bonds as a result of pt binding fall into the vb at around @xmath28 ev . remaining partially unsaturated defect states move down to lower energies leading to the gap widening .",
    "their dos exhibits two sharp van hove singularities with dispersions weaker than those of the clean reconstructed surface .",
    "non - bonding excess charge leads to one and two flat - like filled states just above the vbm for majority and minority spin components , respectively .",
    "a pt dimer energetically prefers to get adsorbed at the trench in interaction with two reactive ti(iv ) cations on the added row and with the in - plane ti5c as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b . in comparison ,",
    "the total energy of a 4@xmath52 cell with pt dimer over ti5c row along [ 100 ] is interestingly just 0.04 ev higher than the lowest energy geometry .",
    "evidently , ti5c is an active site inside the trench .",
    "other cases appear to be far less probable .",
    "for example , pt@xmath2 over and along the ti@xmath2o@xmath7 row is energetically less favorable by 0.92 ev . in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , the dimer shows an extended length of 2.61  which is considerably larger than its isolated value of 2.33  , essentially due to strong pt ",
    "ti coupling . as a result of the pt ",
    "ti(iv ) interactions having 2.44 and 2.56  bonds , the oxygen over the row changes its outward posture and shows an inward alignment . moreover , pt at ti5c site pulls the ti underneath out of its in - plane position by @xmath130.8  leading to a bond length of 2.28  .",
    "these dislocations distort the ti@xmath2o@xmath7 group breaking its symmetry along [ 010 ] .",

    "in addition , a slightly more dispersing pt driven state appear just above the vbm for the spin - up component .",
    "fermi energy is determined by the upper lying impurity state at 1.17 ev above the vbm .",
    "thus , the band gap is larger by 0.75 ev relative to that of ar - tio@xmath2(110 ) .",
    "evidently , the appearance of partial dos contribution from mainly 5@xmath3 electrons of the pt cluster in the vicinity of the fermi energy indicates that pt@xmath2 has non - bonding localized excess charge density which was absent in the case of an isolated pt case .",
    "we have investigated various probable adsorption structures for pt@xmath7 particle .",
    "energetically , pt trimer favors the on - the - row adsorption over an in - trench position as shown in fig .",
    "pt trimer forms in an equilateral triangle with a 2.78  and two 2.57  bonds .",
    "pt@xmath7 and pt@xmath29 cases have some common features .",
    "topmost pt atom pulls ti(iv ) atom so that the bond length becomes 2.49  similar to that of pt / ar - tio@xmath2(110 ) .",

    "[ fig6]c is pulled up as in the single pt case . at the other side of the row pt ",
    "pt bond aligns with [ 100 ] pushing the two oxygens away so that , that side of the row bends outwards .",
    "the dos structure of pt@xmath7/ar - tio@xmath2(110 ) system displays some similarities with that of pt@xmath2 in that a number of impurity states appear below the fermi energy exhibiting dominant pt 5@xmath3 character .",
    "evidently , these weakly dispersing impurity states are brought by the excess charge density localized on the metal cluster . similar to the case pt@xmath2 , fermi level is determined by the upper lying flat - like state at 1.27 ev above the vbm that corresponds to a band gap widening of 0.90 ev with respect to bare reconstructed surface . on the other hand",
    "the offsets of the vb edges differ due to adsorbate induced different local surface relaxations .",
    "pt@xmath7 and a single pt atom stick to the ti@xmath2o@xmath7 group .",
    "therefore the partial dos contribution of bonding 5@xmath3 electrons appear in the corresponding vbs .",
    "since , the coordination number of pt@xmath7 with the added row is relatively larger compared to the pt case , and since pt@xmath7 distorts the row more than a single pt do , bonding pt@xmath7ti@xmath2o@xmath7 states appear in the upper part of the vb .    the minimum energy structure for the pt@xmath4 case has been found to be as shown in fig.[fig6]d where the trench accommodates the cluster .",
    "we see that pt@xmath4 adsorption builds up on the pt@xmath2/ar - tio@xmath2 skeleton by additional two platinum atoms so that a gas phase pt@xmath4 forms in the trench .",
    "inward position of the row oxygen closer to the cluster is similar to that of the pt@xmath2 case .",
    "two adjacent vertical pt ",
    "ti5c bonds become 2.38 and 2.36  that are slightly larger than the value of 2.28  for the pt dimer on the surface .",
    "they reduce the interaction strength by relatively better saturating the dangling bonds .",
    "clearly , off - planar form of the rhombus gets distorted due to pt ",
    "ti(iv ) interactions so that the side bonds are considerably extended .",
    "as in the case of pt@xmath2 adsorption the added row construction gets pulled towards pt@xmath4 through pt - ti(iv ) interaction .",
    "similar arguments can be made for pt@xmath7 and pt  surface cases .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the cb edge is determined by empty pt@xmath4 6@xmath30 states .",
    "eight and seven flat - like occupied impurity states appear in the dos for the spin up and down components , respectively , associated mainly with the 5@xmath3 electrons of pt@xmath4 cluster .",
    "the flat impurity state lying 1.59 ev above the vbm sets the fermi level corresponding to a band gap larger by 0.28 ev relative to that of the bare reconstructed surface .",
    "the positioning of the cluster ",
    "surface bonding states inside the vb is similar to pt@xmath2 case which shows common adsorption characteristics .",
    "pt adsorbates prefer to bind to ti atoms on the added - row model of the reconstructed surface since ti@xmath2o@xmath7 stoichiometry leads to oxygen deficiency .",
    "hence , oxygens on the added - row become less reactive compared to ti cations .",
    "as a trend , odd and even numbered cluster sizes show different adsorption characteristics . while clusters with odd number of pt atoms energetically prefer to be on the added row terrace , even numbered ones relax into the trench at one side of the row .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to see that pt@xmath4surface system has common elements with pt@xmath2 case as a building block , although they were considered distinctly and their initial structures were not relevant in this sense .",
    "pt clusters in the trench breaks the symmetrical formation of the added row construction along [ 010 ] while on - the - row adsorption more or less resumes the symmetry .",
    "a systematic analysis of atomic and electronic structure of small pt particles , from monomers to tetramers , supported on regular and defect sites of tio@xmath2(110 ) surface has been presented based on hubbard u corrected hybrid dft calculations using dudarev s approach . the atomic structure of the titania supported pt clusters determined by the surface stoichiometry that constrains the charge density .",
    "the calculated binding energies of pt particles on the onishi and iwasawa model of the ( 1@xmath52 ) surface happens to be greater than those of the corresponding adsorption systems on partially reduced ( oxygen vacant ) and stoichiometric surfaces due to electron delocalization from the reduced ti sites .",
    "interestingly , these chemisorbed pt clusters form geometries similar to their gas phase structures except pt@xmath4 at the defect site on the partially reduced surface where bridging o ",
    "pt interaction plays a role .",
    "in fact , binding energies per pt atom decreases as the pt cluster size increases due to stronger meta - metal coordination .",
    "thus , large pt particles show 3d - like nucleation .",
    "we demonstrated that dft+u method reproduces experimentally observed gap states for the non - stoichiometric surfaces where electronic correlation is of vital importance .",
    "in particular , ti(iv ) 3@xmath3 states have been shown to fall within the band gap of tio@xmath2(110)-(1@xmath52 ) reconstructed surface .",
    "those were incorrectly predicted by pure dft to be inside the cb giving a metallic character , similar to oxygen vacancy states .",
    "interaction of small pt clusters with the tio@xmath2(110 ) delocalizes charge causing distortion in the geometry around the adsorption site .",
    "this significantly alters the band edges of the titania support and also brings band - gap states depending on the cluster size .",
    "the position of these defect states show strong dependence on the lattice relaxations .",
    "consequently , adsorbate  substrate coupling leads to significant band gap narrowing for bulk terminated and partially reduced surfaces while it gives rise to a gap widening in the case of reconstructed surface .",
    "no metallization occurs for pt@xmath0/tio@xmath2 ( @xmath1=14 ) systems .",
    "these results provide good insight into the effect of deposition of small pt particles on the atomic and electronic structure of tio@xmath2(110 ) surfaces with adsorbates .",
    "the detailed analysis of the differences in dos upon pt cluster adsorption puts forward a sound physical picture for adsorbate - substrate interface properties . in pt@xmath0tio@xmath2(110 ) chemisorption systems , the appearance of well localized non - bonding pt impurity states might be useful for catalytic and photovoltaic applications .",

    "<S> the adsorption profiles and electronic structures of pt@xmath0 ( @xmath1=14 ) clusters on stoichiometric , reduced and reconstructed rutile tio@xmath2(110 ) surfaces were systematically studied using on site @xmath3@xmath3 coulomb interaction corrected hybrid density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic structure of small pt cluster adsorbates mainly depend on the stoichiometry of the corresponding titania support . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster shapes on the bulk terminated ideal surface look like their gas phase low energy structures . however </S>",
    "<S> , for instance , they get significantly distorted on the reduced surfaces with increasing oxygen vacancies . on non - stoichiometric surfaces , pt  ti coordination becomes dominant in the determination of the adsorption geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of pt@xmath0/tio@xmath2(110 ) systems can not be correctly described by pure dft methods , particularly for non - stoichiometric cases , due to the inappropriate treatment of the correlation for @xmath3 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we performed dft+u calculations to give a reasonable description of the reconstructed rutile ( 110 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> pt clusters induce local surface relaxations that influence band edges of titania support , and bring a number of band - gap states depending on the cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> significant band gap narrowing occurs upon pt@xmath0surface interaction due to adsorbate driven states on the bulk terminated and reduced surfaces . on the other hand , they give rise to a band gap widening associated to partial reoxidation of the reconstructed surface . </S>",
    "<S> no metallization arises even for pt@xmath4 on rutile . </S>"
