    "the anomalies of dynamic properties are the characteristic feature of the disordered ferroelectrics , polymers and composites .",
    "in particular , strong frequency dispersion of dielectric or magnetic susceptibility was observed in many dipole or spin glasses ( see e.g. [ 1 ] and ref . therein ) .",
    "the dispersion is commonly attributed to existence in the disordered systems of broad spectrum of relaxation times which can be extracted from the observed frequency dependence of susceptibility [ 2 ] .",
    "the background of such phenomenological approach is the model of a superposition of debye relaxors with different relaxation times @xmath1 . in such a model",
    "the dynamic quantities like time or frequency dependence of polarization , system susceptibility etc . can be calculated by averaging of single relaxor characteristics with relaxation time distribution function @xmath3 in supposition of parallel ( independent ) relaxation processes .",
    "the key point of such approach is the form of distribution function .",
    "only a few simple empirical forms were proposed ( rather than calculated in some physical model ) for @xmath3 .",
    "one of them were considered by frchlich [ 3 ] who assumed that in arbitrary range @xmath6 $ ] @xmath3 has constant positive value and outside this range it equals zero . but such form of @xmath3 appeared unable to explain the experimental data for real systems with dielectric response described by cole - cole ( cc ) , davidson - cole ( dc ) , havriliak - negami ( hn ) and other more complex forms , than simple debye equation [ 4 ] .",
    "different and complex enough empirical forms of @xmath3 were shown to be necessary to describe non - debye dielectric response [ 5 ] .",
    "however the extraction of @xmath3 from the experimental data makes it impossible to understand the physical reasons of these properties anomalies .",
    "recently the calculations of linear [ 6,7 ] and nonlinear [ 8 ] dynamic dielectric response were performed for ferroelectric relaxors like pmn , pst , plzt .",
    "random electric field produced by substitutional disorder and other lattice imperfections ( which are known to be the characteristic features of all the disordered systems ) was considered as the main reason of their properties peculiarities via its influence on the barriers between a dipole orientations .",
    "vogel - fulcher law in relaxation time temperature dependence , stretch - exponential behaviour of dynamic polarization [ 6 ] and several peculiarities of dc field non - linear susceptibility [ 8 ] were obtained .    in present work random field theory approach",
    "was applied for calculation of relaxation time distribution function .",
    "the influence of random electric field on the parabolic and rectangular barriers was considered .",
    "the relaxation time distribution function was calculated with the help of random fields distribution function allowing for linear [ 9 ] and non - linear random fields contribution as well as spatial correlation effects in the impurity subsystem [ 10 ] .",
    "random field is known to be the characteristic feature of the disordered systems .",
    "the substitutional disorder , vacancies of ions , impurities and other imperfections are the sources of random electric and elastic field in the system .",
    "these random fields @xmath0 make relaxation times @xmath1 of the dipoles to vary from point to point in a sample , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "possible forms of @xmath2 will be considered below .",
    "the distribution of random electric and elastic fields was calculated earlier in [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] and [ 11 ] respectively in the statistical theory framework .",
    "the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath0 permits to calculate the distribution function of @xmath8 for known distribution of @xmath0 by means of theory of probability . in the case",
    "when @xmath2 is single - valued ( monotonous ) function of @xmath0 the theory of probability gives [ 12 ] :    @xmath9    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the relaxation time and random field distribution functions respectively , @xmath10 is inverse function to @xmath11 . the eq.([dz1 ] ) can be thought about as simple change of variables in normalization integrals @xmath12 where integration is performed over domains of @xmath1 and @xmath0 variation .",
    "the only difference is the modulus of the derivative because the distribution function has to be positive .    in more general case of non - monotonous behaviour of @xmath2 , when one @xmath8 value correspond to several @xmath0-values ( @xmath13 ) , the space of @xmath0 values should be divided into @xmath14 regions ( containing @xmath13 points ) , where function @xmath2 is monotonous ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "now , for the entire @xmath0-domain , @xmath3 can be represented as a sum of expressions like eq.([dz1 ] ) over regions @xmath15 of monotonous behaviour of @xmath16 [ 12 ] :    @xmath17    eq.([dz2 ] ) is general expression for the distribution function of one quantity via the distribution function of another one for a given connection between them .",
    "in particular , eq.([dz2 ] ) can be used for the calculation of random field distribution function @xmath4 allowing for nonlinear and spatial correlation effects via that in the linear case . in general case",
    "internal random field @xmath18 can be written as : @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is @xmath22-component of the field produced in the observation point @xmath23 by a source of @xmath24 type ( e.g. dipoles , point charges , dilatational centers ) situated at the point @xmath25 ; @xmath26 are the coefficients of nonlinearity of @xmath27 order of the host lattice , their dimension being the inverse electric field in @xmath28-th power .    in the linear case ( @xmath29 )",
    "the random field distribution function @xmath30 can be calculated in the statistical theory framework , namely    @xmath31    where averaging ( marked by bar ) of @xmath32-function makes it possible to count all the spatial configurations of random field sources @xmath33 leading to definite random field value @xmath34 .",
    "averaging , neglecting the correlations between random field sources in eq.([dz5 ] ) , leads to well - known expression of statistical theory [ 13,14 ] :    @xmath35    @xmath36    here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the concentration and electric field of @xmath39 random field source .",
    "one can see , that the form of @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 depends strongly on the form of @xmath38 .",
    "so , @xmath41 could not only be of gaussian form ( which is realized , e.g. , for point charges with @xmath42 ) , but also of lorentzian form ( this is the case for electric dipoles with @xmath43 ) .    in the disordered dielectrics the main source of random fields is impurity electric dipole which can have several discrete orientations in a host dielectric lattice ( see ref .",
    "[ 9 ] for details ) . in this case , which is of interest for present consideration , the function @xmath41 chould be calculated with additional quantum statistical averaging over aforementioned discrete orientations .",

    "spatial correlations and nonlinear effects can be taken into account on the base of eq.(3 ) ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for such more general case the random field distribution function can be expressed through @xmath58 with the help of expression like eq.(2 ) [ 15 ] :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 are the real roots of the algebraic equation    @xmath61    we have to emphasize that even for simple enough ( e.g. gaussian , lorentzian ) form of @xmath58 , coefficient @xmath62 in eq.(9 ) will be function of @xmath0 by virtue of eq ( [ dz10 ] ) .",
    "so , the nonlinear distribution function @xmath4 will never be the simple algebraic sum of @xmath63 .",
    "the shape of @xmath4 was calculated recently with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ dz9 ] ) , ( [ dz10 ] ) for the contribution of nonlinear terms of the second ( @xmath64 ) and third ( @xmath65 ) order [ 15,16 ] .",
    "the ordinary ferroelectric materials like pbtio@xmath66 , batio@xmath66 with polar long - range order are known to have unique relaxation time characterizing the rate of macroscopic polarization restoration after external perturbation of the system .",
    "disordered systems like relaxors have broad spectrum of relaxation times , because their most probable states are dipole glass ( dg ) with short - range order polar clusters of @xmath67 size , imbeded into paraelectric phase and/or mixed ferro - glass phase ( fg ) with coexistence of short- and long - range order .",
    "since an orientable electric dipole is usually the nucleation centre of a cluster , the random reorientation of the dipoles can be the main mechanism of the relaxation in the aforementioned disordered systems .",
    "it is commonly belived that the probability of a dipole reorientation temperature dependence is obeyed to arrhenius law    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is a height of a barrier between equivalent dipole orientations .    to obtain the connection between relaxation time @xmath1 and random field @xmath0 ,",
    "let us consider the relaxational dynamics of single impurity ( for definiteness two - orientable ) dipole in a random electric field , created by the rest of impurity dipoles .",
    "it is clear , that in such relaxation process the random field will be time dependent and will play a role of a random force , exerted on the given impurity dipole . for such motion",
    "we can write following langevin equation ( see , e.g. @xcite )    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the displacement of impurity ion ( so that impurity dipole moment @xmath72 , @xmath73 is ion charge ) , @xmath74 determines the actual potential energy of dipole ( e.g. for two - orientable dipole @xmath74 is a conventional double - well potential ) and @xmath75 is a random force with known correlator . without loss of generality",

    "( [ dz132 ] ) , ( [ dz15 ] ) , that the relaxation time depends mainly on the form of potential @xmath74 .",
    "it can be shown that the main contribution to the integrals originates from potential @xmath74 maximum region .",

    "the coinsidence of @xmath210 and debye relaxation time @xmath211 ( see fig.7 ) can be expected also from calculated curves in fig.4 because with increase of random electric dipoles concentration curve 2 has to be transformed into @xmath32-function ( see section 4 ) . since calculated curves in figs . 4 , 5 , 6 , correspond to fg phase with coexistence of short- and long - range order",
    ", we can conclude that this coexistence as well as small ( cc law ) or large nonlinear effect contribution with negative coefficient ( kww , dc laws ) are the physical background of the considered empirical laws .",

    "the coincidence between the relaxation time distribution function obtained from empirical laws and calculated on the base of random fields distribution function gives evidence that random fields are indeed the main physical reason for the distribution of relaxation times .",
    "variety of distribution function forms is due to `` degree of disorder '' ( i.e. presence of different amounts of different random field sources ) in the systems under consideration",

    "<S> the distribution function of relaxation times in disordered dielectrics has been calculated in the random field theory framework . for this purpose , we first consider the dynamics of single two - orientable impurity electric dipole in a random electric field @xmath0 created by the rest of impurities in disordered ferroelectric . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamics is conveniently described by langevin equation . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation time @xmath1 is then a reciprocal probability ( calculated on the base of fokker - planck equation ) of the dipole transition through barrier in a double - well potential ( corresponding to two possible dipole orientations ) , distorted by a random fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the obtained dependence @xmath2 made it possible to obtain the expression for relaxation times distribution function @xmath3(via random fields distribution function @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> latter function has been calculated self - consistently in the random field theory framework . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear random field contribution and effects of spatial correlations between impurities have also been taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that nonlinear contribution of random field gives asymmetric shape of @xmath5 , while in linear case it is symmetric .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison of calculated @xmath5 curves with those extracted from empirical cole - cole ( cc ) , davidson - cole ( dc ) , kohlrausch - william - watts ( kww ) and havriliak - negami ( hn ) functions had shown , that they correspond to mixed ferro - glass phase with coexistence of short and long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> different forms of @xmath3 are determined by linear ( cc ) or nonlinear ( dc , kww , hn ) contributions of random field . </S>"
