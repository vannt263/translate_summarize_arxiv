    "the microcanonical ensemble of the relativistic gas is a subject which has not received much attention in the past .",
    "the reason of scarce interest in this problem is the peculiarity of physical applications , which have been essentially confined within statistical approaches to hadron production and the bag model @xcite ; these are indeed the only cases where involved volumes and particle numbers are so small that microcanonical corrections to average quantities become relevant . otherwise , the involved energies or volumes are so large that canonical and grand - canonical ensembles are appropriate for most practical purposes ( e.g. in relativistic heavy ion collisions ) .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been pointed out that the equivalence , in the thermodynamic limit , between grand - canonical , canonical and microcanonical ensembles does not apply to fluctuations , more in general to moments of multiplicity distributions of order @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , effects of the difference between statistical ensembles might be unveiled in studying multiplicity distributions in relativistic nuclear collisions , @xcite . in view of these phenomenological applications",
    ", it would be then desirable to have an in - depth analysis of the microcanonical ensemble of a relativistic quantum gas .    the main difficulty in tackling this problem stems from the need of imposing a finite volume .",
    "this is necessary to have a correct thermodynamic limit because , being the energy @xmath1 finite by construction , also @xmath2 must be finite if the limit with @xmath3 fixed is to be taken .",
    "strange as it may seem , a full and rigorous treatment of the relativistic microcanonical ensemble of an ideal gas at finite volume is still missing . in all previous works on the subject , at some point , the large volume approximation is introduced ; this is tacitly done , for instance , considering the single - particle level density as continuous , namely replacing sums over discrete quantum states with momentum space integrations @xcite : @xmath4 in a previous work @xcite , we have derived an expression of the microcanonical partition function of an ideal relativistic quantum gas with explicit finite - volume corrections ( see eqs .",
    "( [ singlespecies]),([multispecies ] ) ) .",
    "however , that expression was obtained in an essentially multi - particle first - quantization framework , which , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite should be expected to become inadequate at very low volumes , comparable with the compton wavelength of particles . in this regime",
    ", underlying quantum field effects should become important and pair creation due to localization an unavoidable effect @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are several studies of the microcanonical ensemble of a free quantum field @xcite , but all of them , again , at some point invoke a large - volume approximation . in the limit of large volumes",
    "one obtains the same expressions of the microcanonical partition function and , consequently , of statistical averages as in the first - quantization multi - particle approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to derive a general expression of the microcanonical partition function in a full relativistic quantum field framework , valid for _ any finite volume _ , generalizing the results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we will do this for the simplest case of an ideal gas of spinless bosons and postpone the treatment of particles with spin to a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "we will show that the expression of the microcanonical partition function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in a non - relativistic multi - particle approach holds provided that a consistent prescription of subtracting terms arising from field degrees of freedom outside the considered volume is introduced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sects .  2 and 3 we will argue about general features of the microcanonical ensemble for a relativistic system and discuss several issues concerning a proper definition of the microcanonical partition function . in sect .",
    "4 we will cope with the further issues related to the definition of a microcanonical ensemble for a quantum field at finite volume . sects .",
    "5 and 6 include the main body of this work , where the microcanonical partition function is worked out in a quantum field theoretical framework . in sect .",
    "7 we will summarize and discuss the results .",
    "it is well known that the fundamental tool to calculate statistical averages in any ensemble is the partition function . for the microcanonical ensemble one",
    "has to calculate the _ microcanonical partition function _ ( mpf ) which is usually defined as the number of states with a definite value @xmath1 of total energy : @xmath5 for a quantum system , the mpf is the trace of the operator @xmath6 : ' ' . ]",
    "@xmath7 with proper normalization of the basis states . for instance , for one non - relativistic free particle , one has to calculate the trace summing over plane waves normalized so as to @xmath8 : @xmath9",
    "thereby , one recovers the well known classical expression implying that the mpf is the number of phase space cells with size @xmath10 and given energy @xmath1 .",
    "this number is infinite as the volume is unbounded and it is thus impossible to calculate a meaningful thermodynamic limit at finite energy density .",
    "hence , one usually considers a system confined within a finite region by modifying the hamiltonian @xmath11 with the addition of infinite potential walls , i.e. setting @xmath12 where @xmath11 is the actual internal hamiltonian and @xmath13 an external potential implementing infinite walls .",
    "classically , this leads to a finite @xmath14 , namely : @xmath15 where @xmath2 is the volume of the region encompassed by the potential walls . to denote both the finite region and its volume . ]",
    "also the corresponding quantum problem can be easily solved and one has : @xmath16 where the sum runs over all wave vectors @xmath17 which , for a rectangular box with side @xmath18 and periodic boundary conditions , are labelled by three integers @xmath19 such that @xmath20 . the difficulty of the quantum expression ( [ discrete ] ) with respect to the classical one ( [ classic ] ) is that , for a given energy @xmath1 , a set of integers fulfilling the constraint imposed by the dirac s @xmath21 : @xmath22 in general does not exist .",
    "therefore , the mpf vanishes except for a discrete set of total energies , for which it is divergent .",
    "one has a finite result only for the integral number of states @xmath23 , that is the number of states with an energy less than a given @xmath24 , but this is clearly a stepwise and non - differentiable function of @xmath24 .",
    "this holds for an ideal gas of any finite number of particles : strictly speaking , the mpf can not be defined at finite energy and volume as a continous function . only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 an expression like ( [ discrete ] ) becomes meaningful because it is then possible to replace the sum over discrete levels with a phase space integration : @xmath27 therefore , for a truly finite quantum system , one needs a better definition of microcanonical partition function .",
    "a definition which does not suffer from previous drawbacks is the following : @xmath28 where @xmath11 is the internal hamiltonian , without external confining potential , and the @xmath29 s form a complete set of normalized _ localized states _ ,",
    "i.e. a complete set of states for the wavefunctions vanishing out of the region @xmath2 .",
    "it should be stressed that these states are not a basis of the full hilbert space because wavefunctions which do not vanish out of @xmath2 can not be expanded onto this basis ; thence the notation @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 meaning that the trace in eq .",
    "( [ mpf1 ] ) is not a proper one .",
    "the difference between ( [ mpf1 ] ) and a definition like ( [ mpf0 ] ) is that @xmath29 are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath11 and the right hand side of ( [ mpf1 ] ) does not reduce to a discrete sum of @xmath21 s .",
    "in fact , this is crucial to have a continuous function of @xmath1 , unlike ( [ discrete ] ) .    as an example , let us work out the definition ( [ mpf1 ] ) for the single free particle confined in a rectangular box by infinite potential walls and compare it to ( [ 1part ] ) .",
    "a complete set of states for this problem is : @xmath32 therefore , the mpf definition ( [ mpf1 ] ) implies : @xmath33 where we have inserted a resolution of the identity by using a complete set of states for the full hilbert space . the sum in ( [ examp1 ] )",
    "can be calculated and yields : @xmath34 \\big|^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{{\\bf k } } \\frac{1}{v } \\int_v \\d^3 { { \\rm x}}\\int_v \\d^3 { { \\rm x } } ' \\ ,     \\exp[\\i{\\bf k}\\cdot ( { \\bf x}-{\\bf x } ' ) ] \\exp[-\\i{\\bf p}\\cdot ( { \\bf x}-{\\bf x } ' ) ]    \\nonumber \\\\ & & =   \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\int_v \\d^3 { { \\rm x}}\\int_v \\d^3 { { \\rm x } } ' \\ , \\delta^3({\\bf x}-{\\bf x } ' ) ]     \\exp[-\\i{\\bf p}\\cdot ( { \\bf x}-{\\bf x } ' ) ] = \\frac{v}{(2\\pi)^3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the completeness relation in @xmath2 : @xmath35 =     \\delta^3({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}')\\ ] ] has been used .",
    "thus , by using ( [ examp2 ] ) , the eq .",
    "( [ examp1 ] ) turns into : @xmath36 that is the same expression ( [ classic ] ) as in the classical case .",
    "the mpf ( [ examp3 ] ) is now manifestly a continuous function of @xmath1 and , remarkably , its thermodynamic limit @xmath26 is the same as the thermodynamic limit of the  pure \" quantum expression ( [ discrete ] ) ( because of ( [ sumocell ] ) ) . since the only strict requirement for a well defined mpf is to reproduce the correct thermodynamic limit , for a gas one can choose a definition like ( [ mpf1 ] ) instead of @xmath37 in ( [ discrete ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again that in the passage from ( [ discrete ] ) to ( [ mpf1 ] ) the hamiltonian embodying an external confining potential is replaced with the internal hamiltonian while , at the same time , the localized eigenstates of the former hamiltonian are used to calculate the trace .",
    "in special relativity , the microcanonical ensemble must include momentum conservation beside energy s to fulfill lorentz invariance .",
    "this means that the mpf definition ( [ mpf1 ] ) should be generalized to @xcite : @xmath38 @xmath39 being the four - momentum of the system and @xmath40 the four - momentum operator .",
    "the mpf now being a number of states per four - momentum cell , it is a lorentz - invariant quantity .",
    "the calculation of the mpf is easiest in the rest - frame of the system , where @xmath41 and the four - volume @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the four - velocity and @xmath2 the proper volume of the system , reduces to ( v,*0 * ) , according to the usual formulation of statistical relativistic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "( [ micro1 ] ) can be further generalized by enforcing the conservation of not only energy - momentum but of the maximal set of conserved quantities , i.e. a maximal set of commuting observables built with the generators of the poincar group . to achieve this",
    ", one has to replace @xmath44 in ( [ micro1 ] ) with a generic projector @xmath45 over an irreducible state of the representation of the poincar group @xcite , i.e : @xmath46 this ensemble is still generally defined as microcanonical ensemble and ( [ mpf ] ) microcanonical partition function .    in this work",
    ", we will confine to a microcanonical ensemble where only energy - momentum is fixed , i.e. our projector @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ mpf ] ) will be : @xmath48 and to an ideal quantum gas , i.e. with @xmath49 being the free four - momentum operator .",
    "in fact , it should be stressed that @xmath50 is not a proper projector , because @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a divergent constant .",
    "this is owing to the fact that normalized projectors onto irreducible representations can not be defined for non - compact groups , such as the space - time translation group t(4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will maintain this naming even for non - idempotent operators , relaxing mathematical rigor , because it will be favorable to adopt the projection formalism .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the definition ( [ mpf1 ] ) involving only the internal ( free ) hamiltonian , is much more fit than ( [ discrete ] ) for a relativistic generalization .",
    "besides the advantage of restoring continuity in @xmath1 , discussed in previous section , this formulation can be easily extended to the full set of conservation laws without major conceptual difficulty .",
    "conversely , had one tried to generalize ( [ discrete ] ) , one should have defined a finite region and _ afterwards _ sought the observables commuting with the hamiltonian supplemented with an external confining potential .",
    "this would have not been an easy task , and , moreover , a maximal set of observables commuting with the modified @xmath11 would not , in general , define a poincar algebra .",
    "this is a well known problem in the static bag model where the translational invariance is manifestly broken and momentum is thus not conserved . on the other hand , in the definition ( [ mpf ] ) , we deal with the original poincar algebra of unmodified ( free ) operators and enforce the localization through the projector onto confined states .",
    "( [ mpf ] ) can be recast as a full trace by inserting a complete set of states @xmath53 into ( [ mpf ] ) : @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is , by definition , the projector onto the hilbert subspace @xmath56 of confined states ( i.e. of wavefunctions vanishing out of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the formula ( [ mpf2 ] ) is the starting point to carry out a calculation of the mpf at finite volume .",
    "the first thing to do is to expand ( [ mpf2 ] ) as a sum of partition functions at fixed multiplicities , i.e. : @xmath57 for a single species gas and : @xmath58 for a multi - species gas , where @xmath59 is a set of particle multiplicities for each species @xmath60 , defining a _",

    "( [ singlespecies ] ) follows .",
    "we will refer to the expression ( [ clust ] ) as the nrqm one , meaning that is has been obtained in this first - quantized multi - particle nrqm framework , where , for instance , particles and antiparticles are simply considered as different species and their contributions factorize .",
    "one could envisage that a projector like ( [ pv1 ] ) , written in terms of fock space states , could be simply carried over to the relativistic quantum field case , where @xmath96 are states of the localized problem , obtained by solving the free field equations in a box with suitable boundary conditions . yet",
    ", some difficulties soon arise .",
    "first of all , whilst in nrqm the single - particle localized wavefunction @xmath85 and the free plane wave state @xmath97 live in the same hilbert space , in quantum field theory the localized and the non - localized problem are associated with distinct hilbert spaces .",
    "thus , unlike in nrqm , it is not clear how to calculate a product like @xmath92 .",
    "secondly , even if there was a definite prescription for it , it should be expected that _ the integrated occupation numbers of the localized problem do not coincide with actual particle multiplicities unless the volume is infinite_. to understand this point , one should keep in mind that properly called particles arise from solutions of the free field equations over the whole space and that the hamiltonian eigenstates of the localized problem are conceptually different .",
    "consequently , the integrated particle number operators in the whole space should differ from integrated number operators within the finite region .",
    "hence , unlike in nrqm , a state with definite integrated occupation numbers @xmath98 ( we purposely refrain from calling them particle numbers ) should be expected to have non vanishing components on _ all _ free states with different numbers of actual particles , namely : @xmath99 where @xmath100 are non - trivial complex coefficients , and ( [ condition ] ) no longer holds . only in the large volume limit one",
    "expects that the integrated occupation numbers coincide with actual multiplicities and eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) applies .",
    "this kind of effect is pointed out in the introduction of landau s book on quantum field theory @xcite : when trying to localize an electron , an electron - positron pair unavoidably appears , meaning that the localized single  particle \" is indeed a superposition of many true , asymptotic particle states .",
    "another relevant manifestation of this difference which is probably more familiar , is the casimir effect , which is related to the difference between the true vacuum state @xmath101 and the localized vacuum state @xmath102 .",
    "hence , all formulae derived under the approximation ( [ condition ] ) are asymptotic ones , valid in the limit @xmath26 but not at strictly finite volume .",
    "thus , one should expect significant finite - volume corrections to the eqs .",
    "( [ clust ] ) and the ensuing mpf ( [ singlespecies ] ) in a quantum field treatment .",
    "if we want to give an expression like @xmath92 a precise meaning in a quantum field framework , we first need to map the hilbert space @xmath56 of the localized problem into the hilbert space @xmath103 of the free field over the whole space .",
    "this can be done by mapping the field eigenstates and operators of @xmath103 into @xmath56 in a natural way as : @xmath104 this allows writing linear , non - bijective , bogoliubov relations expressing the annihilation and creation operators of the finite region problem as a function of those of the whole ( real scalar ) field ( see appendix a for derivation ) : @xmath105 where @xmath106 are triplets of numbers labelling kinematical modes , just like the aforementioned @xmath87 , @xmath107 is the associated energy , @xmath108 and : @xmath109 @xmath110 being a complete set of orthonormal wavefunctions for the finite region .",
    "a remarkable feature of relativistic quantum fields is that , unlike in nrqm , the localized annihilation operators have non - vanishing components onto the creation operators in the whole space , as shown by ( [ bogo ] ) .",
    "this confirms our expectation that a localized state with definite integrated occupation numbers is a non - trivial linear combination of states with different particle multiplicities .",
    "expectedly , as the volume increases , these components become smaller and in the infinite volume limit one recovers @xmath111 ( see appendix a )",
    ".    starting from the bogoliubov relations ( [ bogo ] ) , it should be possible , in principle , to calculate the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ confstates ] ) , thence the microcanonical state weight ( [ t4density ] ) by using the expansion ( [ pv1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we do not really need to do that .",
    "it is more advantageous , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , to write the projector @xmath83 in terms of field states rather than occupation numbers of field modes within the finite region . indeed , in the general definition in eq .",
    "( [ mpf2 ] ) : @xmath112 the states @xmath29 are a complete set of states of the hilbert space of the localized problem @xmath56 , where the degrees of freedom are values of the field in each point of the region @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the above projector is a resolution of the identity of the localized problem and can be written as ( for a real scalar field ) : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the functional measure ; the index @xmath2 means that the functional integration must be performed over the field degrees of freedom in the region @xmath2 , that is @xmath117 .",
    "the normalization of the states is chosen so as to @xmath118 to ensure the idempotency of @xmath83 .",
    "if we now want to give expressions like : @xmath119 a clear meaning , we should find a way of completing the tensor product in the projector ( [ pv2 ] ) with the field states outside the region @xmath2 such a way the scalar product can be performed unambiguously .",
    "unfortunately the answer to this question is not unique and the projector can be extended to @xmath103 in infinitely many ways .",
    "what is important is that the result of the calculation is independent of how the projector has been extended .",
    "thus , at the end of the calculation , one has to check whether spurious terms appear , possibly divergent , depending explicitely on the chosen state of the field _ outside _",
    "@xmath2 and these terms must be subtracted away .",
