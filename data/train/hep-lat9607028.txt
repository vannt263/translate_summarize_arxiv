    "gauge one obtains  @xcite : @xmath30 however , it was pointed out  @xcite that the quadratic action is affected by the presence of negative eigenvalues which give rise to the unstable modes .",
    "it turns out that the stabilization of the unstable modes induces a negative classical - like term  @xcite which cancels the classical energy  @xcite : @xmath31 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath32 .    on the lattice we must evaluate the effective action in the weak coupling region . in the one - loop approximation it turns out",
    "that even the lattice quadratic action displays the unstable modes . discarding some irrelevant operators we find an approximate formula for the unstable modes eingenvalues : @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in our simulations we fix @xmath35 and vary @xmath36 with @xmath37 . inserting these values into eq .",
