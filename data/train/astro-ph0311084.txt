    "bl lacertae objects constitute one of the most extreme classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , distinguished by their high luminosity , rapid variability , high ( @xmath9 per cent ) optical and radio polarization , radio core - dominance , apparent superluminal speeds , and almost complete lack of emission lines ( e.g. , kollgaard 1994 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . the broad - band emission in these objects , which extends from the radio to the gamma - ray band , appears to be dominated by non - thermal processes from the heart of the agn , undiluted by the thermal emission present in other agn .",
    "therefore , bl lacs represent the ideal class to study to further our understanding of non - thermal emission in agn .",
    "synchrotron emission combined with inverse compton scattering is generally thought to be the mechanism responsible for the production of radiation over such a wide energy range ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency , @xmath10 , ranges across several orders of magnitude , going from the far - infrared to the hard x - ray band .",
    "sources at the extremes of this wide distribution are referred to as low - energy peaked ( lbl ) and high - energy peaked ( hbl ) bl lacs , respectively ( giommi & padovani 1994 ; padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "radio - selected samples include mostly objects of the lbl type , while x - ray selected samples are mostly made up of hbl .",
    "this scenario makes clear and strong predictions on the x - ray spectra for the two classes . in the relatively narrow _ rosat _",
    "band differences between the two classes became apparent only when very large bl lac samples ( @xmath11 per cent of the then known objects ) were considered ( padovani & giommi 1996 ; lamer , brunner & staubert 1996 ) .",
    "the _ bepposax _ satellite with its broad - band x - ray ( @xmath12 kev ) spectral capabilities , is particularly well suited for a detailed analysis of the individual x - ray spectra of these sources .    in padovani",
    "et al . ( 2001 ; paper i ) we presented _ bepposax _ observations of seven 1-jy bl lacs ( plus an additional `` intermediate '' source ) , six of them lbl .",

    "this is confirmed also by considering only the five lbl with indication of low - energy steepening : using the broken power - law fit values , @xmath128 approaches one ( @xmath129 , with three objects having values @xmath130 and two @xmath131 ) .    on the other side",
    ", we have the three hbl , namely s5 0716 + 714 , mkn 501 , and pks 2005@xmath21489 .",
    "the mean value in this case is @xmath132 , which increases to @xmath133 if we exclude mkn 501 , found in an extremely high state , with very large @xmath10 and a flat synchrotron spectrum , as predicted by the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ nupeak_alpha ] .",
    "the evidence for spectral curvature here is mixed . while mkn 501 shows flattening at lower energies ( @xmath134 below @xmath3 kev ; pian et al .",
    "1998 ) , s5 0716 + 714 shows steepening ( @xmath4 below @xmath135 kev ; giommi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this difference can be explained by looking at fig .",
    "[ nupeak_alpha ] . while s5 0716 + 714 is an hbl with @xmath136 hz , and therefore relatively close to lbl values , mkn 501",
    "was observed by _",
    "bepposax _ in outburst , with @xmath137 kev or @xmath138 hz . in one case we are then seeing a mix of synchrotron and inverse compton radiation , while in the other we are looking at the overall steepening of pure synchrotron emission .",
    "the _ bepposax _ picture for hbl , supported also by their sed , is then that of a synchrotron dominance , with the flat inverse compton component making a contribution for intermediate sources . as regards _",
    "data , we get @xmath139 ( and a median value of 0.92 ) .",
    "the mean flux ratio is @xmath140 ( @xmath108 median ) , a factor @xmath141 larger than for the lbl . the mean flux ratio at 1 kev is a factor @xmath32 larger for hbl than for lbl .",
    "we note that large variability has been seen in the synchrotron component of several bl lacs observed with _",
    "( ravasio et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) and possibly only once , to the best of our knowledge , in their inverse compton component ( in the case of pks 1144@xmath21379 : paper i ) .",
    "comparing single power - law fits , however , one should be aware of another factor that could contribute to different values of @xmath142 for hbl and lbl . as pointed out by beckmann et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the different x - ray spectral shapes of hbl and lbl could play a role , given the different spectral response of the two instrument .",
    "lbl have flat inverse compton spectra but synchrotron emission , with a steep spectrum , sometimes dominates at soft energies ( in @xmath143 per cent of our sources ) .",
    "the fits to their _ bepposax _ lecs / mecs spectra , which sample a much larger range towards high energies than the _ rosat _  pspc spectra , may then be mostly sensitive to the flat inverse compton component , with the result that the fitted flux at 1 kev ( and integrated in the soft band ) is lower than that inferred from the _ rosat _  fits .",
    "this effect is less important when a broken power - law is adopted ( see above ) , but the relatively low statistics of the lecs data may not always justify a statistical preference of this model with respect to the single power - law one .      as mentioned above , since @xmath144 per cent of the objects have nearly simultaneous x - ray and radio data , we can address the relation between x - ray and radio emission almost independently of variability .",
    "[ lxlr ] plots the radio power @xmath145 vs. the x - ray power @xmath146 for our sources .",
    "as expected , the hbl , having larger @xmath10 values , have larger @xmath146 at a given @xmath145 and therefore occupy the bottom - right part of the diagram .",
    "the correlation between @xmath145 and @xmath146 for lbl is surprisingly tight , strong , and linear .",
    "we find @xmath147 , significant at the @xmath148 per cent level .",
    "a partial correlation analysis ( e.g. , padovani 1992 ) , shows that the correlation is still very strong ( @xmath149 per cent ) even when the common redshift dependence of the two powers is subtracted off .",
    "equivalently , @xmath150 has a very small dispersion for lbl .",
    "we get @xmath151 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ lxlr ] ) . given the tightness of the correlation , and the importance that the suggested strong link between the radio and x - ray band would have for lbl",
    ", we have looked in the umrao database for radio observations at 4.8 ghz nearly simultaneous with the _ rosat _ data presented by urry et al .",
    "this provided us with 11 more sources , for a total of 22 1-jy lbl , @xmath152 per cent of them with nearly simultaneous x - ray and radio data .",
    "the results obtained for our _ bepposax _ sources are confirmed with this enlarged sample .",
    "namely , we find now @xmath153 , significant at the @xmath148 per cent level .",
    "as before , the correlation is still very strong ( @xmath154 per cent ) when the common redshift dependence is subtracted off .",
    "we get @xmath155 ( dotted line in fig . [ lxlr ] ) for the 11 _ rosat _ sources , not significantly different from our previous value , and a mean for the 22 1-jy lbl of @xmath156 .",
    "this means that the x - ray power ( or flux ) can be extrapolated from the radio power ( or flux ) within @xmath157 per cent over almost eight orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note that the strong @xmath158 correlation displayed by the 1-jy lbl is _ not _ only due to the nearly simultaneous radio and x - ray data .",
    "even if we use the original 1-jy data , in fact , we find a strong correlation ( @xmath159 per cent ) for the 22 sources in fig .",
    "6 , still very significant ( @xmath154 per cent ) when the redshift effect is subtracted off .",
    "the slope of the correlation is slightly flatter and @xmath160 is slightly larger ( although not significantly so : @xmath161 ) , as on average the 1 jy fluxes are larger than the umrao ones , but the dispersion is still very small .",
    "we note that the relatively small range in @xmath162 for lbl , although never studied with nearly simultaneous radio and x - ray data , has been previously noted , amongst others , by padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) and fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to the best of our knowledge , however , all previous studies of the @xmath163 correlation for 1-jy bl lacs did not distinguish between lbl and hbl , thereby reducing the significance of the correlation .",
    "the interpretation of the strong linear link between x - ray and radio emission components in lbl suggested by the @xmath158 correlation is not straightforward within the currently accepted scenario . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ seds ] , in fact , our one - zone model can not reproduce the observed radio flux , thought to originate in a region of the jet larger than the ( more compact ) one responsible for most of the emission , including x - rays . on the other hand , since the radio spectra in these sources are invariably flat , there is a correlation between the radio flux at the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath164 ghz ) of the smaller x - ray emitting region and the flux at 5 ghz .",
    "this may account , at least in part , for the @xmath158 correlation , even if the powers in the two bands are produced in different parts of the jet .",
    "we have presented new _ bepposax _ observations of four bl lacertae objects selected from the 1-jy sample , all lbl , i.e. , characterized by a peak in their multifrequency spectra at infrared / optical energies .",
    "we have then used these data plus data previously published by us ( 7 sources ; paper i ) and others ( 3 sources ) to study the properties of the hard x - ray spectra of an x - ray flux - limited 1-jy sub - sample ( containing 11 lbl and 3 hbl ) and constrain the emission processes .",
    "a relatively simple picture comes out from this paper : a dominance of inverse compton emission in the x - ray band of lbl , with @xmath11 per cent of the sources showing also a likely synchrotron component .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the _ bepposax _ spectra of our lbl sources are relatively flat ( @xmath165 ) . for five sources",
    "broken power - law models improve the fits at the 98 per cent level when the @xmath75 values for the single sources are added up .",
    "the resulting best - fit spectra all concur in indicating a flatter component emerging at higher energies , with spectral changes @xmath166 around @xmath167 kev .",
    "2 .   our lbl have a typical difference between _ bepposax _ and _ rosat _  spectral slopes @xmath168 .",
    "the interpretation of this effect is complicated by possible _ rosat",
    "_  miscalibrations ( which , if at all present , could explain a difference @xmath127 ) and variability effects , as the mean flux ratio is @xmath169 , but is consistent with the picture of a variable synchrotron emission contributing in the soft x - ray band , leading to high fluxes and steeper spectra when present .",
    "3 .   despite the non - simultaneity of the multifrequency data ( umrao radio data excluded )",
    "it is apparent that the _ bepposax _ spectra indicate a different emission component in the seds of our lbl sources , separate from that responsible for the low energy emission .",
    "in fact , the extrapolation of the relatively flat _ bepposax _ slopes can not be extended to much lower frequencies since the predicted optical flux would be orders of magnitude below the observed value .",
    "a sharp steepening towards lower frequencies is then necessary to meet the much higher optical ( synchrotron ) flux .",
    "our interpretation of the @xmath170 diagram is the one originally proposed by padovani & giommi ( 1996 ) for the _ rosat _  data .",
    "namely , @xmath71 steepens moving from lbl to hbl as synchrotron replaces inverse compton as the main emission mechanism in the x - ray band .",
    "the spectral index then flattens again as the synchrotron peak moves to higher energies in the x - ray band , eventually converging to the relatively flat value characteristic of synchrotron emission before the peak .",
    "again , this fits perfectly with a dominance of inverse compton emission in our lbl .",
    "we find a very tight proportionality between nearly simultaneous radio and x - ray powers for our lbl sources and 11 additional lbl with _",
    "data , such that x - ray power can be predicted within @xmath157 per cent from the radio power .",
    "this points to a strong link between x - ray and radio emission components in lbl .",
    "the data for the ( small number of ) hbl are consistent with other studies based on larger samples of sources and confirm the dominance of synchrotron emission in the _ bepposax _ band .",
