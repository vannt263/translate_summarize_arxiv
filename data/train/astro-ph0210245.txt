    "surface stellar abundances of c , n , o , and often na , mg , and al are found to be variable among red giants within a globular cluster .",
    "the physical process responsible for these star - to - star element variations is still uncertain ( see the reviews of kraft 1994 and pinsonneault 1997 , as well as cohen _",
    "et al . _",
    "2001 and ventura _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) .    in order to study the origin of the star - to - star abundance variations",
    ", we started a program to determine chemical abundances of the nearer galactic globular cluster stars . in our first series of papers",
    ", we studied a sample of stars in m71 , the nearest globular cluster reachable from the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "our sample of 25 m71 stars includes stars over a large range in luminosity , in order to study in a consistent manner red giants , horizontal branch stars , and stars at the main sequence turnoff .",
    "we measured the iron abundance and the abundance ratios for 23 elements with respect to fe in our sample of m71 stars , using high dispersion ( r=@xmath0=35,000 ) optical spectra obtained with hires at the keck observatory .",
    "we found that the [ fe / h ]  abundances is given by @xmath4 on a scale where @xmath5 h atoms . then [ x / h ] = log@xmath6[n(x)/n(h ) ] @xmath7 log@xmath6[n(x)/n(h ) ] , and similarly for [ x / fe ] . ] from both fe i ( [ fe / h ]  = @xmath8 ) and fe ii ( [ fe / h ]  = @xmath9 ) lines agree with each other and with earlier determinations and that the [ fe / h ]  obtained from fe i and fe ii lines is constant within the rather small uncertainties over the full range in effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) and luminosity @xcite . in @xcite , we found that the neutron capture , the iron peak and the @xmath1element abundance ratios show no trend with @xmath2 , and low scatter around the mean between the top of the rgb and near the main sequence turnoff .",
    "we detected an anti - correlation between o and na abundances in our sample of members of m71 which extends to the main sequence .",
    "we also observed a statistically significant correlation between al and na abundances extending to @xmath10 , fainter than the luminosity of the rgb bump in m5 .    in the present paper , we have studied a sample of 25 stars in the globular cluster m5 , again covering a wide range in luminosity .",
    "m5 is the nearest intermediate metallicity globular cluster accessible from a northern hemisphere site .",
    "we adopt current values from the on - line database of @xcite for its apparent distance modulus at @xmath11 of 14.31 mag with a reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.03 mag .",
    "recent ccd photometric studies of this cluster , focusing primarily on its age , are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the predominantly blue horizontal branch of m5 .",
    "previous high dispersion abundance studies , the most extensive of which is @xcite , include only luminous giant and asymptotic giant branch stars . a study of c and n variations among a large sample of m5 stars at the base of the red giant branch is given in @xcite .",
    "important differences with m71 include the lower metallicity of m5 , its much lower reddening , its location further from the galactic plane and its larger radial velocity .",
    "m5 is more distant than m71 , but this is largely compensated by the higher reddening of m71 .",
    "hence the apparent brightness at @xmath11 of stars at a given evolutionary stage is roughly equal in the two clusters .",
    "to the maximum extent possible , the observing strategy , the atomic data and the analysis procedures used here are identical to those developed in our earlier papers on m71 @xcite .",
    "stars were chosen to span the range from the tip of the red giant branch to the main sequence turnoff of m5 .",
    "this cluster lies considerably further from the galactic plane at @xmath12 than does m71 , hence field star contamination is a much less serious problem for m5 .",
    "the photometric database of @xcite and @xcite , which is described in considerable detail in @xcite , was used to verify that the selected stars lie on the cluster locus in various color - magnitude diagrams . for the more luminous stars , we required the assignment of a high probability of membership by @xcite in his proper motion survey of this globular cluster .",
    "only reasonably isolated stars were selected .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the star names are from @xcite for the brightest stars , from @xcite or , for the fainter stars previously not catalogued , are assigned based on the object s j2000 coordinates , so that a star with ra , dec of 15 rm rs.s + 2 dm dd is identified in this paper with the name grmrss_dmdd .      all spectra were obtained with hires @xcite at the keck observatory .",
    "a maximum slit length of 14 arc sec can be used with our instrumental configuration without orders overlapping . since",
    "an image rotator for hires is available ( built under the leadership of david tytler ) , if we can find pairs of program stars with separations less than 8 arcsec , they can be observed together on a single exposure .",
    "pairs were pre - selected to contain two members of the m5 sample .",
    "all stars were observed in pairs , except for the very bright star iv-59 , for which there was no suitable nearby star with which to form a pair .",
    "one set of three suitable stars was found which fit within the maximum allowed slit length .",
    "the desired minimum snr was 75 over a 4 pixel resolution element for a wavelength near the center of echelle order 58 ( @xmath136150  ) .",
    "this is calculated strictly from the counts in the object spectrum , and excludes noise from cosmic ray hits , sky subtraction , flattening problems , etc .",
    "since the nights were dark , sky subtraction is not an issue except at the specific wavelengths corresponding to strong night sky emission lines , such as the na d doublet .",
    "this snr goal was achieved , at considerable cost in observing time , for most of the stars , although we did not meet this goal for the six main sequence turnoff region stars included in our sample .",
    "note that for a fixed snr in the continuum , for a star of a given luminosity , the lower metallicity of m5 leads to weaker absorption lines , making it difficult to maintain the desired precision of the analysis .",
    "approximate measurements of the radial velocity were made on line , and if a star was determined to be a non - member , the observations were terminated .",
    "very few non - members turned up in this way .",
    "if the probable non - member was the second component in a pair , an attempt was made to switch to another position angle to pick up a different second star , when a possible candidate that was bright enough was available within the limits of the 8 arcsec maximum separation . through creative use of close pairs ,",
    "a sample of 27 members of m5 were observed with hires , two of which are blue horizontal branch stars in m5 ; we subsequently ignore them .",
    "figure  [ m05_hr ] shows the sample in m5 superposed on a color - magnitude diagram of this globular cluster .",
    "the observations were centered at about 6500 , as were the m71 spectra , with the reddest order reaching the o triplet . because the hires detector is undersized",
    ", our spectra do not cover the full length of each echelle order without gaps in the wavelength coverage .",
    "we wanted to include key lines of critical elements , specifically the 6300 , 6363 [ oi ] lines , the 7770 o triplet , the na doublet at 6154 , 6160 , and the 6696 , 6698  al i lines .",
    "however , it was impossible to create a single instrumental configuration which included all the desired spectral features in the wavelength range 6000 to 8000  , and a single compromise configuration had to be adopted .",
    "in particular , although the 6696 , 6698  al i doublet is the most useful feature of that element in this spectral region , we could not get it to fit into a single hires setting together with the o lines .",
    "the spectra of the brighter stars in our m5 sample were observed on two nights in june 2000 .",
    "a 1.15 arcsec slit was used , which provides a spectral resolution of 34,000 .",
    "all long integrations were broken up into separate exposures , each 1200 sec long , to optimize cosmic ray removal .",
    "these data were reduced by brad behr using figaro ( shortridge 1993 ) scripts with commands written by mccarthy and tomaney ( mccarthy 1988 ) specifically for echelle data reduction .",
    "observations continued with the same instrumental configuration during three nights in may 2001 to cover the fainter stars in the sample .",
    "this set of hires data was reduced by jgc using a combination of figaro scripts and the software package makee .",
    "table 1 gives details of the hires exposures for each star , with the total exposure time for each object . the signal to noise ratio per 4 pixel spectral resolution element in the continuum at 6150 ",
    "is also given , calculated assuming poisson statistics and ignoring issues of cosmic ray removal , flattening etc .",
    "the latter become non - negligible for the very long hires integrations necessary to reach as faint as possible in m5 .",
    "also listed in the last column is the radial velocity for each star , measured from the hires spectra as described in ",
    "[ radial_velocity ] .",
    "radial velocities were measured from all the m5 spectra using a list of 36 strong isolated features within the wavelength range of the hires spectra with laboratory wavelengths from the nist atomic spectra database version 2.0 ( nist standard reference database # 78 ) .",
    "using an approximate initial @xmath14 , the list of automatically detected lines , restricted to the strongest detected lines only , generated in the course of measuring the equivalent widths of the lines ( see  [ equiv_widths ] ) in the spectrum of each of the m5 stars was then searched for each of these features . a @xmath14 for each line",
    "was determined from the central wavelength of the best - fit gaussian , and the average of these defined the @xmath14 for the star .",
    "heliocentric corrections appropriate for each exposure were then applied to the measured @xmath14 .",
    "the radial velocities for our sample of stars is listed in column 6 of table  [ tab_sample ] . based on their measured radial velocities ,",
    "all the stars of our sample are members of m5 .",
    "they have a mean @xmath14 of + 55.0 km  s@xmath15 , with @xmath16 = 4.3 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of @xcite of @xmath17 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the velocity dispersion we find for m5 is also in good agreement with the published value of 4.9 km  s@xmath15  for a large sample of luminous giants from @xcite .",
    "the search for absorption features present in our hires data and the measurement of their equivalent width ( @xmath18 ) was done automatically with a fortran code , ewdet , developed for our globular cluster project .",
    "details of this code and its features are described in @xcite . because m5 is considerably more metal poor than m71 , the determination of the continuum level was easier , and the equivalent widths measured",
    "automatically should be more reliable .",
    "a list of unblended atomic lines with atomic parameters was created by inspection of the spectra of m5 stars , as well as the online solar spectrum taken with the fts at the national solar observatory of wallace , hinkle & livingston ( 1998 ) and the set of solar line identifications of @xcite .",
    "the list of lines identified and measured by ewdet is then correlated , taking the radial velocity into account , to the list of suitable unblended lines to specifically identify the various atomic lines .    in @xcite , we derived @xmath19@xmath18  relation ( where @xmath20 is the central depth of the line ) for the fe i lines of `` the weak line set '' ( fe i lines within 2@xmath16 of the @xmath19@xmath18  fit , with @xmath18  @xmath21 60 m , and errors less than a third of the @xmath18 ) for our analysis of similar spectra in the globular cluster m71 .",
    "we used these @xmath19@xmath18  relations to determine `` the good line set '' ( lines with errors less than a third of the @xmath18  and with @xmath18computed from the derived @xmath19@xmath18  relations ) in the m71 data .",
    "we have used the same approach for the analysis of the atomic spectral lines present in the spectra of our m5 sample .",
    "we computed the @xmath19@xmath18  fit for each star s fe i lines , except for the six faintest stars , where not enough fe i lines were detected to do so . for the six faintest stars we used for the reminder of the analysis the equivalent widths measured automatically by ewdet .",
    "we used the @xmath19@xmath18  relations to determine `` the weak line set '' for the fe i lines and the `` the good line set '' for the lines of all the elements , except for the o i and ca i lines , and for the elements that show hyperfine structure splitting ( sc ii , v i , mn i , co i , cu i , and ba ii ) . the equivalent widths of the o i lines were measured by hand , since thermal motions become important at its low atomic weight and the @xmath19@xmath18  relations derived for fe i lines may no longer be valid . for ca i lines and the lines of elements that show hyperfine structure splitting",
    ", we used the equivalent widths measured automatically by ewdet , but did not force them to fit the fe i @xmath19@xmath18  relationship due to the probable different broadening mechanisms .",
    "a few of the ca i lines were strong enough to be on the damping part of the curve of growth , but only in the spectra of the coolest m5 giants .",
    "the @xmath18  used in the abundance analysis are listed in table  [ tab_ew ] ( available electronically ) .",
    "the provenance of the @xmath22 values and damping constants we adopt in our analysis of m5 stars is discussed below . in general ,",
    "the atomic data and the analysis procedures used here are identical to those developed in our earlier papers on m71 @xcite . at the request of the referee , however ,",
    "we have updated the solar equivalent widths we use to derive the adopted solar abundances ( see  [ section_sun ] ) .",
    "only small changes in the resulting abundances are introduced by these modifications .",
    "transition probabilities for the fe i lines were obtained from several laboratory experiments , including studies of fe i absorption lines produced by iron vapor in a carbon tube furnace @xcite ( oxford group ) , measurement of radiative lifetimes of fe i transitions by laser induced fluorescence @xcite , fe i emission line spectroscopy from a low current arc @xcite , and emission lines of fe i from a shock tube @xcite .",
    "we also considered solar @xmath22 values from @xcite when needed .",
    "the fe i @xmath22 values obtained by the different experiments were placed into a common scale with respect to the results from @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the @xmath22 values for our fe ii lines were taken from the solar analysis of @xcite , @xcite , and from the semiempirical calculations of @xcite .",
    "for fe i and fe ii @xmath22 values , we used the same priority order for the @xmath22 values from different experiments as in @xcite .",
    "transition probabilities for the lines of atomic species other than iron were obtained from the nist atomic spectra database ( nist standard reference database # 78 , see @xcite ) when possible .",
    "nearly 80% of the lines selected as suitable from the hires spectra have transition probabilities from the nist database . for the remaining lines the @xmath22 values come from the inverted solar analysis of @xcite , with the exception of la ii and eu ii lines ( see  [ section_sun ] ) .",
    "the solar @xmath22 values of mg i , ca i , ti i , cr i , and ni i were corrected by the factors derived earlier ( see table  3 of ramrez & cohen 2002 ) which are needed to place both sets of transition probabilities onto the same scale .",
    "the correction factors were computed as the mean difference in log(@xmath22 ) between the nist and solar values for the lines in common .",
    "six elements show hyperfine structure splitting ( sc ii , v i , mn i , co i , cu i , and ba ii ) . the corresponding hyperfine structure constants were taken from @xcite .      as in our m71 work ,",
    "the damping constants for all fe i and fe ii lines were set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening following @xcite .",
    "some of the na i and ca i lines are strong enough for damping effects to be important .",
    "for na i the interaction constants , @xmath23 , of the van der waals broadening were taken from the solar analysis of @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied collisional broadening of 17 ca i lines . comparing their experimental results and the predicted values of @xmath23",
    "obtained using the unsld approximation , we found that the experimental @xmath23 are comparable to the unsld @xmath23 .",
    "thus for the ca i we used the experimental @xmath23 from @xcite when available ; if not , we set @xmath23 to be that of the unsld approximation .",
    "the empirical values of @xmath23 for mg i from @xcite are also used .",
    "for the lines of all other ions we set @xmath23 to be twice the unsld approximation following @xcite .",
    "we need to establish the solar abundances corresponding to our adopted set of @xmath22 values and damping constants .",
    "we measured our own set of solar equivalent widths from the online solar spectrum taken with the fts at the national solar observatory of wallace , hinkle & livingston ( 1998 ) using our code ewdet .",
    "solar abundance ratios were then computed using our compilation of atomic parameters , the kurucz model atmosphere for the sun @xcite and this list of solar equivalent widths .",
    "we adopt @xmath24= 1.0 km  s@xmath15  for the sun .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab_solar ] .",
    "the entries in this table are slightly different than the entries in table  4 of @xcite , calculated for the m71 analysis , since the solar equivalent widths used in the m71 study were taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "assuming our atomic parameters , solar model , solar @xmath18  and analysis are correct , this calculation should reproduce the current compilation of photospheric solar abundances of @xcite .",
    "the difference @xmath25 between our solar abundances and the photospheric solar abundances from @xcite is listed in column 5 of table  [ tab_solar ] .",
    "we ascribe small differences to problems in the absolute scale of the adopted @xmath22 values . in general",
    ", these differences are reasonably small , with the exception of [ o / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] and [ zr / fe ] . for these three species ,",
    "we fail to reproduce the solar abundance by more than 0.1 dex .",
    "the difference we found for [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath26 dex ) is almost the same as the correction factor that needs to be applied to the inverted solar @xmath22 values from @xcite , none of which were actually used here since all the detected ca  i lines for our m5 sample are included in the nist database .",
    "the nist @xmath22 scale is within 0.08 dex of that of @xcite , but @xcite claims to reproduce the solar ca abundance with their @xmath22 values .",
    "he achieves this because his solar @xmath18  are considerably larger than those of @xcite or those measured here .",
    "if there is an error in the nist ca i absolute @xmath22 value scale , then our procedure of comparing to our own solar abundance will remove it exactly when [ ca / fe ] is calculated for the program stars .",
    "however , if the problem lies in how best to measure the @xmath18of very strong ca  i solar lines , our procedure can only remove the error approximately .",
    "furthermore the solar ca lines are quite strong , and hence the inferred ca abundance is somewhat dependent on the choice of damping constant , but that is not the case in general in m5 .",
    "the o abundance listed in table  [ tab_solar ] corresponds to the solar value derived from the forbidden lines , which are very weak in the sun .",
    "the three zr  i lines , which give @xmath27 dex , are also very weak , but our @xmath22 values and solar @xmath18  agree reasonably well with those of @xcite , who carefully analyzed the solar zr abundance",
    ". it may be that this is a problem in the details of the temperature gradient in the outermost layers of our adopted model atmosphere ( see comments in bimont et al .",
    "if such an error is independent of @xmath2 , this is basically the same as having an error in the scale of the transition probabilities , which would lead to an incorrect solar @xmath28(zr ) , but would not affect any of our results which are expressed at [ zr / fe ] .",
    "la  ii and eu  ii are special cases .",
    "the solar @xmath18  for the single line of eu  ii and for those few lines of la  ii that are detected here or in our m71 sample are extremely weak .",
    "there are no @xmath22 values in nist for these lines .",
    "we were forced to use the transition probabilities from @xcite , adjusted as recommended by @xcite , for the three la  ii lines . since the submission of our m71 paper , a new analysis of the spectrum of la  ii has appeared .",
    "@xcite provide transition probabilities , hyperfine structure , and a new determination of the solar la abundance , but only include one of the three lines used either here or in our analysis of m71 stars .",
    "we therefore adopt the solar la abundance from @xcite , and scale our @xmath22 values by + 0.10 dex so that they agree with the new one for the single line in common , at 6390 .",
    "this is the strongest of the three lines , and the only one seen in most of our stars in which la  ii is detected . for similar reasons , we adopt the @xmath22 value of @xcite for the single observed line of eu  ii as well as their solar eu abundance of eu .",
    "we use the solar abundances listed in table  [ tab_solar ] , derived from our choice of atomic line parameters , to compute the iron abundance and abundance ratios for our sample of m5 stars .",
    "we follow the philosophy developed for m71 and described in @xcite .",
    "we adopt current values from the on - line database of @xcite for the apparent distance modulus of m5 at @xmath11 of 14.31 mag with a reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.03 mag .",
    "the relative extinction in various passbands is taken from @xcite ( see also schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) . based on the high dispersion analysis of @xcite for a large sample of luminous red giants in m5 , we adopt as an initial guess a metallicity for the cluster of [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.0 dex .",
    "we utilize here the grid of predicted broad band colors and bolometric corrections of @xcite based on the marcs stellar atmosphere code of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that the kurucz and marcs predicted colors are essentially identical , at least for the specific colors used here .",
    "the observed broad band @xmath11 and @xmath29 colors for each program star from the photometric database of @xcite and @xcite , corrected for extinction , are used to determine @xmath2 .",
    "the set of models with metallicity of @xmath71.0 dex , nearest to our initial estimate of [ fe / h ] , is used .",
    "table  [ tab_ste ] lists the @xmath2  thus deduced .",
    "the reddening to m5 is small , making possible extinction variations across the cluster irrelevant .",
    "we assume an random photometric error of 0.02 mag applies to @xmath30 from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , this translates into a total uncertainty in @xmath2  of 75 k for giants rising to 150 k for main sequence stars using @xmath30 .",
    "one can obtain a reasonable guess as to the magnitude of possible systematic errors in peter stetson s photometric database for m5 by comparing the first and second versions of his catalog ; there appear to be mean differences in the photometric zero points of @xmath31 mag , corresponding to a mean difference in @xmath2  of @xmath1375 k.    we have slightly smoothed the @xmath2  for the fainter stars in our sample by small amounts to ensure that stars at the approximately same evolutionary stage have the approximately the same stellar parameters .",
    "once an initial guess at @xmath2  has been established from a broad band color , it is possible with minimal assumptions to evaluate log(@xmath32 )  using observational data .",
    "the adopted distance modulus , initial guess at @xmath2 , and an assumed stellar mass ( we adopt 0.8 @xmath33for the stars in the m5 sample ) are combined with the known interstellar absorption , the predictions of the model atmosphere grid for bolometric corrections as well as a broad band observed @xmath11 mag to calculate log(@xmath32 ) .",
    "an iterative scheme is used to correct for the small dependence of the predictions of the model atmosphere grid on log(@xmath32 )  itself .",
    "rapid convergence is achieved .",
    "it is important to note that because of the constraint of a known distance to m5 , the uncertainty in log(@xmath32 )  is small , @xmath34 dex when comparing two members of m5 . propagating an uncertainty of 15% in the cluster distance , 5% in the stellar mass , and a generous 3% in @xmath2 , and ignoring any covariance",
    ", leads to a potential systematic error of @xmath350.2 dex for log(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the excitation temperature ( a spectroscopic measure of @xmath2 ) of a star can be determined from the observed spectrum by requiring the derived abundance of an ion with many observed lines covering a wide range of lower excitation potential @xmath36 to be independent of @xmath36 .",
    "this technique can be applied to 19 of our stars where we have detected fe i lines with sufficient range in @xmath36 . for the determination of the excitation temperature",

    "the ba  ii absorption lines are quite strong among the more luminous rgb starsin m5 .",
    "they have hyperfine structure , and are quite sensitive to the choice of microturbulent velocity ( see table  [ tab_sensit ] ) as well as damping constants .    given that one believes , based on the evidence presented here and in our earlier work on m71 , that the abundances of most , but not all , elements in globular cluster are constant from star to star , one can use the two recent analyses of stars in m5 , our analysis and that of @xcite , as an end - to - end test of the accuracy of abundance analyses .",
    "the two are completely independent , using different model stellar atmospheres grids , different procedures to assign @xmath2 , different ways to measure @xmath18   and independent choices of atomic data , although the same abundance analysis code .",
    "we offer above reasonable explanations to explain the discrepancies in the case of the two elements most divergent between the two analyses . for o  i ,",
    "the explanation involves sample selection and is thus outside the realm of the analysis , while for ba  ii it involves the choice of atomic parameters , factors intrinsic to the analysis itself . for the remaining 12 elements in common , table  [ tab_comp ]",
    "serves as an interesting example of how well abundance analyses can be carried out on globular cluster stars over a wide range of luminosities in this era of 10-m telescopes .",
    "we note the excellent agreement of the fe abundance , @xmath25[fe / h ] = 0.06 dex , while for 11 elements in common @xmath25[x / h](us - ivans ) = @xmath73 dex      in figure  [ common ] , we provide a comparison between our previous high - resolution abundance analyses of a comparable sample of stars in m71 with the present sample in m5 for every element in common to both analyses .",
    "our previously published m71 abundance ratios have been updated to the same solar abundance scale adopted here for the m5 abundance ratios ; see  [ sec_newm71 ] and table  [ table_newm71 ] .",
    "the filled squares correspond to our current analysis of m5 stars and the filled triangles to our previous analysis of m71 stars @xcite .",
    "the error bars indicate @xmath70 for each abundance ratio .",
    "overall m5 appears to have abundance ratios very similar to those of m71 ; the mean abundances for each element determined in each globular cluster agree to within the 1@xmath70 uncertainties of each measurement for most of the elements displayed .",
    "we note that [ o / fe ] in m5 appears to be at the top of the range seen in m71 , where @xcite did detect a definite range , again suggesting that in m5 we are failing to detect the full range in o abundance due to weak lines and inadequate precision spectra , and that at least some of our non - detections or upper limits do in fact correspond to low [ o / fe ] stars in m5 , as were seen by @xcite among the stars near the tip of the rgb .",
    "nickel and copper show differences in abundance relative to fe larger than 2@xmath70 . in each case",
    ", the abundance ratio [ x / fe ] is smaller in m5 than it is in m71 .",
    "nickel is discrepant primarily because its predicted dispersion is so low , 0.05 dex .",
    "this occurs because ni is so similar to fe in its properties that many errors cancel in forming the abundance ratio [ ni / fe ] .",
    "the actual difference of [ ni / fe](m5-m71 ) is only @xmath74 dex .",
    "the abundance of cu is based on single line which has complex hyperfine structure that might not have been modeled correctly .",
    "the mean abundances deduced from lines of ba  ii differ between m71 and m5 by an amount larger than 0.2 dex , but smaller than 2@xmath70",
    ". there are three reasonably strong ba  ii lines used for both the m5 and m71 stars , which makes this perhaps the most credible of the proposed differences between abundance ratios in our sample of stars m71 and in those of m5 .",
    "this might be related to the dependence with metallicity of the production of @xmath57- and @xmath58-process elements @xcite .",
    "more likely , however , it too is a reflection of difficulties in the two analyses .",
    "the ba absorption lines tend to be quite strong , hence the choice of damping constants is important .",
    "they also have hyperfine structure whose pattern depends on the relative abundances of the various stable isotopes of ba , which might vary depending on how the ba is produced . as shown in table  [ tab_sensit ] , @xmath70 is large because of the high sensivity of ba  ii lines to changes in @xmath75 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the [ ba / fe ] deduced by @xcite for the luminous giants in m5 is close to that we derive for m71 , where the ba  ii lines are stronger .",
    "if we were to believe that the ba abundance difference between m5 and m71 is real , we should see a similar difference in the la abundance , as la is also a primarily a s - process element at this metallicity .",
    "the la abundance , which is based on three weak lines , is from our work identical in m5 and in m71 , suggesting that the apparent difference in the ba abundance between the two clusters is not real .",
    "some of the well known trends characteristic of halo star abundances as reviewed by @xcite , such as the overabundance of [ @xmath76/fe ] in metal poor stars , are easily seen in figure  [ common ] .",
    "now that we have completed a detailed abundance analysis for a large sample of stars from the rgb tip to near the main sequence in two globular clusters , we look back to summarize the main trends we have seen , offer some brief remarks in some cases on the possible causes , and some comments on future direction .",
    "first we focus on the fact that for most elements , no star to star scatter in abundance in seen which is larger than that expected from the errors in the observational data and in the analysis . for ions with multiple detected lines ,",
    "this is a tight constraint , sometimes less than 0.05 dex and often less than 0.1 dex .",
    "for this same set of elements , there are no trends of abundance ratios varying with @xmath2  or luminosity within either of these two globular clusters larger than @xmath3 dex for the better studied elements .",
    "furthermore , with the minor caveats noted in  [ section_m71comp ] , there are no substantial changes ( @xmath77 dex ) in the abundance ratios between m71 and m5 even though m5 is a factor of 4 more metal poor .",
    "in addition to their implications for the formation of globular clusters , a subject we defer to the end of this series of papers , these observational facts provide strong limits for the potential presence and strength of diffusion processes in the atmospheres of globular cluster stars , as discussed in detail in  [ section_diffusion ] . the results for fe ( with two ions with multiple detected lines in most stars ) , and for other elements as well ,",
    "constrain the amplitude of non - lte effects ( see  [ sec_iron_abun ] ) .    both diffusion and non - lte",
    "are expected to produce larger perturbations at lower metallicity .",
    "we now have a well understood analysis procedure , which we have verified from end to end through comparison of our results with those of an independent analysis of much brighter stars in m5 by @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to move to the extremely metal poor globular clusters , as we intend to do in the next papers in this series , with confidence in the validity of our work .",
    "finally , we turn to the even more interesting case of elements which do show star to star variations .",
    "we have seen na , o and al vary in a correlated manner in m71 . in m5 , where al was not observed and detecting variations in o is quite hard due to the very weak lines in the faint low luminosity stars in our sample , we detected na varying . in neither cluster",
    "did we see mg varying . to first order",
    ", these variations have a constant amplitude independent of luminosity .",
    "much more detailed information is available for c and n from study of molecular bands in the spectra of even larger samples of stars in m5 and in m71 @xcite .",
    "there are many possible explanations for these variations , which we may roughly classify into primordial variations , internal nucleosynthesis within a star plus mixing to the surface of that star , and production of material in some other star which somehow ( through stellar winds , supernovae , etc . )",
    "then gets accreted onto the star we actually observe .",
    "( a variant of the latter scheme involving planets is quite popular lately for some other problems . )",
    "these theories each predict the minimum luminosity at which such effects can be detected . for example ,",
    "if a star is of such a low mass that na can not be produced , irrespective of whether or not mixing of material to the surface is feasible , no na variations at the stellar surface can be created .",
    "a scenario invoking primordial variations within the gas cloud from which the globular cluster formed does not seem to be able to explain why only certain selected elements are varying .",
    "detailed theoretical study of the relevant mechanisms includes meridional mixing @xcite , turbulent diffusion @xcite , proton - capture nuclear reactions together with deep mixing @xcite , and self pollution @xcite .",
    "a key feature is the predicted lowest luminosity ( lowest mass ) in an old metal poor population ( i.e. a globular cluster ) at which deep mixing can be effective , which usually is at or near that of the the bump in the luminosity function of the rgb @xcite . the location of the bump of the rgb in a cluster of the metallicity of m5 is predicted to be around 0.2 magnitudes above the horizontal branch @xcite .",
    "this is considerably brighter than the stars among which we found variations in o , na and mg in m71 or the variations in na detected here in m5 .",
    "a second key feature is the amplitude of and correlation among variations , e.g. in our dataset we find that , in particular , that in m71 na and o are anti - correlated , while na and al are correlated .",
    "these are signatures to the process by which this material was synthesized .",
    "we suggest that to first order the amplitude of the abundance variations appears to be independent of luminosity , another important clue .",
    "the weight of the evidence is now overwhelming that substantial variations exist in the elements c , n , o , na and al well below the cutoff luminosity of the rgb bump . variations in all of these elements , except perhaps al , reach to even lower luminosities , below the base of the giant branch to the main sequence in old metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "current theories are hard - pressed to reproduce the trends seen among low luminosity stars in globular clusters in the mounting body of observational data on abundance variations from our own work here and in m71 @xcite as well as that of others ( 47 tuc by cannon _",

    "we can only hope that continued work in this field , particularly our our upcoming papers on even more metal poor globular clusters , and continued parallel work on variation of the molecular bands in these stars , combined with the continued development of various theoretical aspects of stellar evolution , will lead us to new insights and resolution of these issues .",
