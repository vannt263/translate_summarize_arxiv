    "the problem of compactifying the ( generalized ) jacobian of a singular curve has been studied since igusa s work @xcite around 1950 .",
    "he constructed a compactification of the jacobian of a nodal and irreducible curve @xmath0 as the limit of the jacobians of smooth curves approaching @xmath0 .",
    "igusa also showed that his compactification does not depend on the considered family of smooth curves .",
    "an intrinsic characterization of the boundary points of igusa s compactification as the torsion free , rank 1 sheaves which are not line bundles is due to mumford and mayer .",
    "the complete construction for a family of integral curves over a noetherian hensel local ring with residue field separably closed was carried out by dsouza @xcite .",
    "one year later , altman and kleiman @xcite gave the construction for a general family of integral curves .",
    "when the curve @xmath0 is reducible and nodal , oda and seshadri @xcite produced a family of compactified jacobians @xmath8 parameterized by an element @xmath9 of a real vector space .",
    "seshadri dealt in @xcite with the general case of a reduced curve considering sheaves of higher rank as well .    in 1994 , caporaso showed @xcite how to compactify the relative jacobian over the moduli of stable curves and described the boundary points of the compactified jacobian of a stable curve @xmath0 as invertible sheaves on certain deligne - mumford semistable curves that have @xmath0 as a stable model .",
    "recently , pandharipande @xcite has given another construction with the boundary points now representing torsion free , rank 1 sheaves and he showed that caporaso s compactification was equivalent to his .",
    "on the other hand , esteves @xcite constructed a compactification of the relative jacobian of a family of geometrically reduced and connected curves and compared it with seshadri s construction @xcite using theta funtions and alexeev @xcite gave a description of the jacobian of certain singular curves in terms of the orientations on complete subgraphs of the dual graph of the curve .",
    "most of the above papers are devoted to the construction of the compactified jacobian of a curve , not to describe it .",
    "moreover these constructions are only valid for certain projective curves .",
    "however simpson s work @xcite on the moduli of pure coherent sheaves on projective schemes allows us to define in a natural way the jacobian of any polarized projective curve @xmath0 as the space @xmath10 of equivalence classes of stable invertible sheaves with degree @xmath2 with respect to the fixed polarization .",
    "this is precisely the definition we adopt and we also denote by @xmath11 the space of equivalence classes of semistable pure dimension one sheaves with rank 1 on every irreducible component of @xmath0 and degree @xmath2 .    in some recent papers about the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles on elliptic fibrations , for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the jacobian in the sense of simpson of spectral curves appears .",
    "beauville @xcite uses it as well in counting the number of rational curves on k3 surfaces .",
    "this suggests the necessity to determine the structure of these simpson jacobians .",
    "in this paper we give an explicit description of the structure of these simpson schemes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of any degree @xmath2 , for @xmath0 a polarized curve of the following types : tree - like curves and all reduced and reducible curves that can appear as singular fibers of an elliptic fibration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will work over an algebraically closed field @xmath12 of characteristic zero .    in the second part",
    "we define the simpson jacobian @xmath10 of any projective curve @xmath0 over @xmath12 , but the definition is also functorial . by simpson s work @xcite , the moduli space @xmath1 of equivalence classes of semistable pure dimension one sheaves on @xmath0 of ( polarized ) rank 1 and",
    "degree @xmath2 is a projective scheme that contains @xmath10 and then it is a compactification of @xmath10 .",
    "the subscheme @xmath11 is always a connected component of this compactification @xmath1 .",
    "we show that @xmath11 is only one of the connected components that can appear in the moduli space @xmath1 ( see proposition [ p : otrascomponentes ] ) and it coincides with the compactifications constructed by other authors .",
    "the description of the connected components of @xmath1 different to @xmath11 is still an open problem and , as we show ( see example [ e : fraccionario ] ) , it have to cover the study of moduli spaces of higher rational rank sheaves on reducible curves .",
    "this study is not included in this paper , however when the curve @xmath0 is also reduced , as our curves , the connected component @xmath11 is projective so that it can be considered as a compactification of the simpson jacobian of @xmath0 as well .",
    "in the third part we collect some general properties about semistable pure dimension one rank 1 sheaves on reducible curves and some results relating the picard groups of two reduced and projective curves if there is a birational and finite morphism between them .    in the fourth part",
    "we give the description ( theorem [ t : treelike ] ) of the simpson jacobian @xmath10 and of the connected component @xmath11 of its compactification when @xmath0 is a tree - like curve , that is , a projective reduced and connected curve such that the intersection points of its irreducible components are disconnecting ordinary double points , but the singularities lying only at one irreducible component can be arbitrary singularities .",
    "the picard group of a tree - like curve is isomorphic to the direct product of the picard groups of its irreducible components .",
    "then we use a teixidor s lemma @xcite that allows us to order the irreducible components of @xmath0 and to find subcurves @xmath13 of @xmath0 that are also tree - like curves and intersect their complements in @xmath0 at just one point . with this lemma ,",
    "the determination of the stable rank 1 sheaves on @xmath0 which are locally free at all intersection points of the irreducible components of @xmath0 is analogous to this given by teixidor in @xcite for curves of compact type .",
    "when the sheaf is not locally free at some intersection points , to study its stability we use a seshadri s lemma describing the stalk of a pure dimension one sheaf at the intersection points . finally for strictly semistable rank 1 sheaves , we give a recurrent algorithm that enables us to construct a jordan - hlder filtration and then to determine their @xmath14-equivalence classes .",
    "the descriptions given here , and in particular the recurrent algorithm , will be essential in the next part for the analysis of the simpson schemes of kodaira reduced fibers of an elliptic fibration .",
    "the aim of the fifth part is to describe the structure of the simpson jacobian and of the connected component @xmath11 of its compactification @xmath1 when @xmath0 is a reducible and reduced kodaira fiber of an elliptic fibration , that is , a fiber of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 with @xmath7 . using the results of the second section ,",
    "we first determine the picard group of these curves .",
    "we find then necessary and sufficient conditions for a line bundle to be ( semi)stable . for the analysis of ( semi)stable pure dimension",
    "one rank 1 sheaves which are not line bundles , the fundamental result is lemma [ l : nodelinea ] : if @xmath0 is a projective reduced and connected curve , @xmath15 a singular point at which @xmath0 is gorenstein and @xmath16 is a pure dimension one rank 1 sheaf on @xmath0 which is not invertible at @xmath15 , then there is a projective curve @xmath17 , a finite birational morphism @xmath18 and a pure dimension one rank 1 sheaf @xmath19 on @xmath17 such that @xmath20 .",
    "hence we prove that there is an isomorphism @xmath21 between the border of the connected component @xmath11 of @xmath0 and the whole component @xmath22 of the curve @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath0 is a fiber of type @xmath4 or @xmath6 , the curve @xmath17 is a tree - like curve and then the structure of this border is determined by previous results . if @xmath0 is a fiber of type @xmath5 , that is , three rational smooth curves meeting at one point @xmath15 , the curve @xmath17 is also the union of three rational smooth curves meeting at one point",
    "but in such a way that the curve @xmath17 can not be embedded ( even locally ) in a smooth surface ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the study of simpson schemes for this curve @xmath17 is in the subsection [ s : curvax ] .",
    "lemma [ l : localizacion2 ] , whose proof is a generalization of the proof given by seshadri for lemma [ l : localizacion ] in this paper , plays a fundamental role in the most difficult part of the analysis , the study of ( semi)stable pure dimension one rank 1 sheaves on @xmath17 which are not line bundles .",
    "subsection [ s : curvax ] completes then the description of the simpson schemes for the curves of type @xmath5 .",
    "we finish the paper with a special study for the case of degree zero .",
    "this case is very interesting because the polarization does not influence semistability conditions ( corollary [ c : nopolarizacion ] ) .",
    "we also prove that if @xmath0 is a fiber of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , all strictly semistable pure dimension one rank 1 sheaves of degree 0 on @xmath0 are in the same @xmath14-equivalence class ( corollary [ c : equivalentes ] ) and that the moduli space of semistable pure dimension one sheaves of rank 1 and degree 0 on @xmath0 is never a fine moduli space ( corollary [ c : nofino ] ) .",
    "these results can be found in @xcite for a curve @xmath0 of type @xmath23 where cldraru use them to prove that the connected component @xmath24 is isomorphic to a rational curve with one node .",
    "if @xmath25 is an elliptic fibration with reduced fibers , the global structure of the compactified simpson jacobian @xmath26 is not totally known ( when the fibers of @xmath27 are geometrically integral some results can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the descriptions of the compactified simpson jacobians of degree zero given here ( propositions [ p : grado0 ] and [ p : propiasemi ] ) will be very useful to study the singular fibers of @xmath28 , to know the singularities of the variety @xmath26 and to find , using the results of @xcite , examples of non isomorphic elliptic fibrations having isomorphic derived categories .",
    "two consequences of the given descriptions are the following : the first is that for reducible curves it is not true in general that the tensor product of semistable pure dimension one sheaves of rank 1 is semistable ( see example [ e : prodtens ] ) and the second is that the pullback of a stable pure dimension one rank 1 sheaf by a finite morphism of reducible curves is not stable either ( see example [ e : imageninversa ] ) .",
    "these two statements constitute the principal problem to generalize to reducible curves the study of abel maps given by esteves , gagn and kleiman in @xcite for families of integral curves .",
    "the results presented here are part of my ph .",
    "d. thesis .",
    "i am very grateful to my advisor d. hernndez ruiprez , who introduced me to the problem of compactifying the generalized jacobian of a curve , for his invaluable help and his constant encouragement .",
