    "their common structure of the ground - state energies as functions of the scaling variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for the single - step growth model and the dprm problem , respectively , gives the universal pdf at the stationary state .",
    "while the ground - state energy of each hamiltonian gives information about the stationary state of the corresponding process , the first excited - state energy , combined with the ground - state energy , is related to the characteristic behavior of the process as it approaches the stationary state .",
    "for example , in the single - step growth model , as @xmath27 , the generating function takes the form e^h(x , t ) ~ \\{-e_0()t + e^- ( ) t } , and similarly for @xmath28 . here",

    "@xmath43 becomes negative , the quasi - particle momenta appearing in the bethe ansatz equations become complex , so solutions are difficult to obtain analytically .",
    "the attractive bose - hubbard hamiltonian is expected to have some resemblance to the ferromagnetic phase of the asymmetric @xmath9 chain hamiltonian considering the equivalence of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "however , for the attractive case , by following the movement of the momenta as @xmath5 changes sign , we find that the quantum numbers for the first excited state should be given by i_j&=&-n-12+j  ( j=1,2,  ,n-1 ) , + i_n&=&-n-32  ( = i_1 ) .",
    "that is , the two quantum numbers @xmath60 and @xmath61 become the same .",
    "such a peculiar distribution of @xmath62 s does not appear in other bethe ansatz solutions such as those for the @xmath9 chain hamiltonian or the repulsive delta - function bose - gas hamiltonian .",
    "we remark that even though the two @xmath62 s are the same , all @xmath54 s are distinct ; otherwise , the wavefunction vanishes .",
    "such a distribution of quantum numbers is confirmed by the consistency between the energies obtained by diagonalizing the bose - hubbard hamiltonian exactly and those obtained by solving the bethe ansatz equations with the above quantum numbers for very weak interactions , for which the two hamiltonians possess almost the same energy spectra .    when there is no interaction ( @xmath63 ) , all quasi - particle momenta , @xmath54 s , are zero for the ground state while for the first excited state , all the @xmath54 s are zero except the last one , @xmath64 . in the complex-@xmath58 plane ,",
    "as the very weak repulsive interaction is turned on , the @xmath65 momenta are shifted infinitesimally from @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and the @xmath68th momentum is shifted infinitesimally to the left from @xmath69 .",
    "all the momenta remain on the real axis . when the interaction is weakly attractive , the @xmath65 momenta become complex with @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 , and the @xmath68th momentum remains on the real axis , but is shifted to the left .",

    "knowledge of the distribution of the quantum numbers is essential for solving the bethe ansatz equations of the attractive delta - function bose - gas hamiltonian . for the original attractive bose - hubbard hamiltonian , the bethe ansatz solutions are the exact solutions for the two - particle sector only , but are good approximate solutions in other sectors provided the density is very low and the interaction is very weak .",
    "this is because the bethe ansatz for the bose - hubbard hamiltonian fails once states with sites occupied by more than three particles are included .",
    "thus , for the sectors with three or more particles , the bethe ansatz solutions may be regarded as approximate eigenstates provided states with more than three particles at a site do not play an important role in the eigenfunctions . in ref .",

    "( [ bh ] ) .",
    "this applies to the attractive interaction case also . for the repulsive bose - hubbard hamiltonian ,",
    "the bethe ansatz is a good approximation when the density is low and the interaction is strong because the strong repulsion prevents many particles from occupying the same site  @xcite . for the attractive bose - hubbard hamiltonian ,",
    "the bethe ansatz is good when the density is low and the interaction is weak because a weak attraction is better for preventing many particles from occupying the same site and because the error is proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "we are interested in the scaling limit @xmath36 with the scaling variable @xmath74 fixed because the common structure of the ground - state energies of the asymmetric @xmath9 chain hamiltonian and of the attractive bose - hubbard hamiltonian is found in this scaling limit . in this section ,",

    "however , for @xmath80 , the asymptotic behavior shows up only after a large crossover region where the effective @xmath1 , @xmath81 , is anomalously large .",

    "for the three - particle sector with @xmath80 , @xmath81 is about @xmath7 in the corresponding range @xmath83 .",
    "looking into the first excited - state energy in fig .  [ energy ] , one can see that the anomalous value of @xmath81 appears in the range of @xmath3 where the first excited - state energies change their signs .",
