    "the possibility of a compactified extra dimension was first discussed by nordstrm , kaluza and klein @xcite . such extra dimension ( ed )",
    "models were later revived by the necessity of a consistent formulation of string theories @xcite . of course , even without string theories , the world may have one or more compactified dimensions .",
    "there are a number of such ed models , and they differ mainly in two ways : first , the number of eds , the geometry of space - time , and the compactification manifold , and second , which particles can go into the extra dimensions ( hereafter called bulk ) and which can not .    in the so - called universal extra dimension ( ued ) model proposed by appelquist , cheng , and dobrescu @xcite , all sm particles can go into the bulk . in the simplest ued scenario ,",
    "there is only one extra dimension , denoted by @xmath4 , compactified on a circle ( @xmath5 ) of radius @xmath6 .",
    "the model predictions remain essentially unchanged if there are more extra dimensions , with a hierarchical radii of compactification .",
    "we will focus on the simplest scenario only .    to get chiral fermions at low - energy ,",
    "one must impose a further @xmath7 symmetry ( @xmath8 ) , so that finally we have an @xmath9 orbifold .",
    "as is well - known , a higher dimension theory is nonrenormalizable and should be treated in the spirit of an effective theory valid upto a scale @xmath10 .",
    "all fields have five space - time components ; when brought down to four dimensions , for each low - mass ( zero - mode ) standard model ( sm ) particle of mass @xmath11 , we get an associated kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower , the @xmath12-th level ( this @xmath12 is the kk number of the particle ) of which has a mass given by m_n^2 = m_0 ^ 2 + .",
    "[ kktree ] this is a tree - level relationship and gets modified once we take into account the radiative corrections .",
    "another important feature of the ued scenario is the conservation of the kk number .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the fact that all particles can go into the fifth dimension and so the momentum along the fifth dimension must be conserved .",
    "also , this means that the lowest - mass @xmath0 particle , which turns out to be the @xmath0 photon , is absolutely stable",
    ". such a lightest kk particle ( lkp ) , just like the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , is an excellent candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "in fact , existence of such a dark matter candidate is a general property of any theory with such a @xmath7 symmetry . to us",
    ", this seems to be the greatest theoretical motivation for ued - type models .",
    "radiative corrections to the masses of the kk particles have been computed in @xcite .",
    "these papers , in particular @xcite , show that the almost mass - degenerate spectrum for any kk level , resulting from eq .",
    "( [ kktree ] ) , splits up due to such correction terms .",
    "there are two types of correction , arising from the fact the fifth dimension is inherently different from the four large dimensions ( a breaking of the lorentz invariance ) .",
    "the first one , which results just from the compactification of the extra dimension , is in general small ( zero for fermions ) and is constant for all @xmath12 levels . this we will call the bulk correction , which arises when the loops can sense the compactification ( _ e.g. _ , loops with nonzero winding number around @xmath4 ) .",
    "the second one , which we will call boundary correction , is comparatively large ( goes as @xmath13 and hence , in principle , can be divergent ) , and plays the major role in determining the exact spectrum and possible decay modes .",
    "the boundary correction terms are related with the interactions present only at the fixed points @xmath14 and @xmath15 . if the interaction is symmetric under the exchange of these fixed points ( this is another @xmath7 symmetry , but not the @xmath7 of @xmath8 ) , the conservation of kk number breaks down to the conservation of kk parity , defined as @xmath16 . thus , lkp is still stable , but one can in principle have kk - number violating vertices in the theory , where the violation is by an even amount .",
    "for example , it is possible to produce an @xmath17 state from two @xmath18 states .",
    "the role of linear colliders in precision study of tev - scale extra dimension models has been already emphasized in the literature @xcite .",
    "the low - energy phenomenology has been discussed in @xcite , and the high - energy collider signatures in @xcite .",
    "the limit on @xmath19 from precision data is about 250 - 300 gev , while the limit estimated from dark matter search @xcite is about a factor of two higher .",
    "the loop corrections are quite insensitive to the precise values of the radiative corrections . with the proposed reach of the international linear collider ( ilc ) in mind",
    ", we will be interested in the range 300 gev @xmath20 500 gev .",
    "it was first pointed out in @xcite that the signals of the ued models may mimic those of r - parity conserving supersymmetry ( susy ) , mainly because of the @xmath7 symmetry of both the theories that predicts a missing energy signal once a sparticle or a kk excitation is produced .",
    "the decay patterns of excited fermions and sfermions are also similar for a significant part of the susy parameter space .",
    "one may hope to discriminate these two models by measuring the spin of the excited particles @xcite , or by producing the @xmath17 gauge bosons as @xmath21-channel resonances @xcite .",
    "the standard verdict is that the excited states are to be first seen at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and a precision study is to be done at the ilc .",
    "one important point that has not been addressed is the production and subsequent decay and detection of the @xmath0 scalars .",
    "this is perhaps the most challenging part of a complete determination of the kk spectrum .",
    "there are four such excited scalars at the @xmath0 level , two charged and two neutral .",
    "not only they are almost mass degenerate , it appears from a study of the spectrum that their only possible decay channel is to the @xmath0 @xmath1 leptons .",
    "ultimately , what we will be left with are 2 - 4 soft @xmath1 leptons plus a huge amount of missing energy",
    ". these @xmath1s may be so soft as to avoid detection .",
    "thus , if we are unlucky , _ the whole excited scalar sector _ may be invisible !",
    "this is to be compared with the susy models , where one is almost certain to detect some of the higgs bosons if they are produced .",
    "a detailed discussion of this follows in sections 2 and 3 .    even if the soft @xmath1 s are visible ( and for most of the parameter space they are ) , the background is still severe .",
    "the most important background comes from another ued process , the @xmath21-channel production of excited @xmath1-lepton pair , which subsequently decays to a pair of @xmath18 soft @xmath1 s and two lkps .",
    "the signal is indeed a fraction of the background , so we need some luck to detect the signal .",
    "there are other backgrounds , but for most of the parameter space they can be brought down by suitable cuts .",
    "the minimal ued model is completely specified by three input parameters : @xmath19 , inverse of the compactification radius , @xmath22 , the effective cutoff of the theory , and @xmath23 , the boundary mass squared ( bms ) term for the excited scalars .",
    "the last parameter can be determined if we can have a precision study of the excited scalar sector .",
    "this appears very tough , if not outright impossible , even at the ilc .",
    "however , we will derive a theoretical bound on @xmath23 from the fact that the @xmath0 charged higgs boson must not be the lkp .",
    "this occurs for large negative values of @xmath23 , of the order of @xmath24-@xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss , briefly , the salient features of the excited higgs sector of the minimal ued model . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the important two- and three - body production processes involving one or more excited scalars , and show their subsequent decay chains .",
    "we also estimate their production cross - section as a function of @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this gives us an idea of the parameter space where such excited bosons can be detected and where they just can not be .",
    "the possible backgrounds are also shown . in section 4 , we find the theoretical lower bound on @xmath23 from the non - lkp condition .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 5 .",
    "let us mention here that though the main focus is on the ilc , an identical study may be performed for clic , the proposed multi - tev @xmath27 machine , with an optimised @xmath28 tev ( and may be upgraded to 5 tev ) , and luminosity of @xmath29 @xmath30 s@xmath31 .",
    "the electron beam at clic may be polarised upto 80% , and the positron beam upto 60 - 80% , from compton scattering off a high power laser beam @xcite .",
    "clearly , the reach of clic will be much higher .",
    "every field in 5 dimension ( @xmath32 ) can be decomposed in terms of even and odd components : _ + ( x^,y ) & = & _ + ^(0)(x^ ) + _ n=1^ _ + ^(n ) ( x^ ) , + _",
    "-(x^,y ) & = & _ n=1^ _ -^(n ) ( x^).at orbifold fixed points @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the odd fields are projected out .",
    "also , any vertex must contain an even number of odd fields to survive under integration over @xmath4 .",
    "for the fermions , left - chiral doublets and right - chiral singlets are even , while the opposite combinations are odd .",
    "it is clear that the higgs fields must be even to maintain the proper yukawa couplings .    in the @xmath0 level , there are four scalar fields : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "higgs boson by @xmath36 . ]",
    "the superscript refers to the charge whereas the subscript refers to the kk number .",
    "the last three fields are just the excitations of the @xmath18 goldstone bosons .",
    "there are three more color - neutral scalars , coming from the fifth components of the gauge fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "they are @xmath7-odd fields , and can occur first only at the @xmath0 level .",
    "they should mix with the goldstone excitations , and a combination of them will act as the goldstone boson of the @xmath0 level . for the neutral fields , this combination , for the @xmath12-th level ,",
    "is given by g^0_n= , and a similar expression for the charged goldstones .",
    "the orthogonal combinations will remain as the physical scalar fields , and we will call them @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath41 , the goldstones are esentially the fifth components of the gauge bosons , whereas the physical scalars are the excitations of the @xmath18 goldstones ( and the @xmath18 higgs boson ) .    in the absence of radiative corrections ,",
    "the tree - level masses of the excited scalars are given by m_h_n^0,a_n^0,h_n^^2= m_n^2+m_h , z , w^^2 , [ higgstree ] but this is modified by radiative corrections , whose effect is simply to add a universal term @xmath42 to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ higgstree ] ) @xcite .",
    "the radiative correction is given by m_h^2 = m_n^2 + , [ radcorhiggs ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 gauge couplings respectively , and @xmath47 is the self - coupling of the higgs boson , given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 gev .",
    "@xmath22 is the effective cutoff scale and @xmath50 is the regularization scale , which may be taken for our case to be @xmath19 .",
    "the term @xmath23 is arbitrary ; this is the bms term for the excited scalars , and is not _ a priori _ calculable . along with @xmath19 and @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 forms the complete set of input parameters to specify the minimal ued model ( of course , one needs to know the @xmath18 higgs boson mass , @xmath51 ) .",
    "note that the hierarchy @xmath52 is fixed .",
    "the necessary feynman rules are easy to derive ; they come from the kinetic term @xmath53 of the higgs field , where @xmath54 runs over all the five dimensions .",
    "after compactification , this generates the couplings of the @xmath18 higgs boson with a pair of excited gauge bosons , with a pair of the fifth component of the gauge bosons , and , the couplings of the excited higgs bosons to @xmath18 and excited gauge bosons . as we have said earlier",
    ", no vertex can have an odd number of @xmath7-odd fields , and higgs excitations are even , so there is no need to take the fifth components of the gauge fields into account ( this can be ensured further by drawing the feynman diagrams and noting that @xmath18 fields are always @xmath7-even ) .",
    "before we go on to the production processes , let us see what these excited scalars should decay into .",
    "unless we go to some bizarre corner of the parameter space with inordinately large value of @xmath23 , these scalars are always lighter than @xmath0 quarks , and so can not decay into them .",
    "similarly , they are also lighter than the excited @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the only @xmath0 states that may be below these bosons are the excited leptons ( including neutrinos ) and @xmath55 , the lkp .",
    "so , almost all the time , they will decay to the excited @xmath1 lepton ( remember that kk - number must be conserved ) .    for large enough values of @xmath23",
    ", all the @xmath0 scalars can be more massive ( albeit very slightly ) than @xmath56 .",
    "however , we have checked that the splitting is almost never sufficient to have a @xmath18 boson at the final state .",
    "a possibility is a three - body decay to a @xmath0 gauge boson and a pair of @xmath18 leptons . with no guarantee of having a soft @xmath1 in the final state ,",
    "such signals are even more difficult to trace than those we will discuss here .",
    "there are two excited @xmath1 leptons , which we will call @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( not to be confused with the @xmath17 excitation of @xmath1 ; we use this notation since we will never talk about @xmath59 excitations in this paper ) . both of them are vectorial in nature , but for @xmath57 , the @xmath60 singlet , the right - chiral state is even while the left - chiral state is odd under @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath58 it is just the opposite . and @xmath58 , but very close to them .",
    "this is due to the off - diagonal term in the @xmath0 @xmath1 mass matrix , which is @xmath61 , and can be safely neglected compared with the diagonal term @xmath19 .",
    "we do not make such hair - splitting distinctions .",
    "the analogy with supersymmetry does not hold , since there is no @xmath62 term to enhance the off - diagonal entries .",
    "] however , all scalars are @xmath7-even , and they must decay to @xmath57 or @xmath58 accompanied by a @xmath18 @xmath1 ( or @xmath63 ) , so @xmath7-odd @xmath1s are not produced from @xmath0 higgs decays .",
    "thus , a neutral excited scalar will decay to an excited @xmath64 and an @xmath18 @xmath65 .",
    "the excited @xmath1s will further decay to the ordinary @xmath1 and the lkp .",
    "the final result of the cascade is two unlike sign @xmath1 leptons and an lkp .",
    "since the lkp will carry most of the energy ( the typical mass difference between lkp and excited scalars is @xmath66 gev ) , both these @xmath1s will be soft .    what about the chirality of these @xmath1s ?",
    "( since they are soft , helicity and chirality can be different . ) the coupling of the scalar with the fermions being yukawa in nature , both right - chiral @xmath57 and left - chiral @xmath58 can be produced , accompanied with a @xmath18 @xmath1 of opposite chirality .",
    "it can be seen from table [ masses ] that @xmath58 is closer to @xmath33 and @xmath39 .",
    "so , from kinematic considerations , more @xmath57s will be produced .",
    "it can so happen that the @xmath58 window is completely closed .",
    ".the masses of @xmath0 scalars . also shown",
    "are the mass of the lkp , @xmath55 , and the masses of the two @xmath0 @xmath1 s ( all in gev ) .",
    "the @xmath0 neutrino is degenerate with @xmath58 . @xmath67",
    "gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ masses ]    for large negative values of @xmath23 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath39 , and even @xmath33 , can go down below the @xmath57 threshold . in that case",
    "they will be comparatively long - lived , decaying into the lkp plus a fermion - antifermion pair at @xmath18 , or simply to a photon and lkp , through a triangle diagram .",
    "the charged boson , @xmath69 , will decay into a @xmath70 and a @xmath63 .",
    "the neutrino , whether @xmath18 or @xmath0 , is left - chiral , so the @xmath1 must be right - chiral in nature .",
    "the @xmath0 neutrino is unobservable ( it decays to a @xmath18 neutrino and the lkp ; note that lkp can directly couple to the neutrino since it is almost an excited @xmath71 , the hypercharge gauge boson ) , and can be called a virtual lkp .",
    "other decay channels are kinematically forbidden ( like @xmath72 ) or highly suppressed ( like @xmath73 ) , so we will not consider them any further .    for large negative values of @xmath23 , the @xmath1 window may be closed . in that case",
    "the only possible decay option is @xmath74 through a virtual @xmath18 @xmath75 .",
    "since lkp has a very small @xmath76-admixture , this decay is bound to have a long lifetime , and may even leave a visible charged track .    in summary",
    ", this means that ( unless we entertain the possibility of large negative @xmath23 ) from pair production of @xmath77 one gets a pair of unlike sign soft @xmath1s plus missing energy . for the neutral pair @xmath78 one gets four soft @xmath1s plus missing energy .",
    "the problem is that some of these @xmath1s ( particularly for the @xmath79 final state ) can be so soft as to miss detection .    in fig .  1 we show the production cross - section for the charged higgs pair as a function of @xmath19 for @xmath80 ( the values are not much sensitive on the cutoff ) .",
    "the numerical cumputations were done with the calchep package @xcite , augmented by the implementation of ued .",
    "figures 2 - 4 show the cross - section for other rare processes , most of them being hopelessly small , even at ilc ( because of backgrounds that are hard to remove , more on this later ) .",
    "@xmath33 is mostly produced through the fusion of two vector bosons , one of @xmath18 and the other of @xmath0 , associated with two neutrinos or two electrons .",
    "as is expected , the cross - sections for those processes that occur via @xmath21-channel exchanges ( like the bjorken process , @xmath81 ) fall with energy , while those from vector boson fusion rise .",
    "thus , the latter may have a better chance at clic .",
    "there are other channels with tiny contributions , like @xmath82 , which we have not included in the analysis .",
    "this channel , for example , is tiny even on the @xmath83 resonance and completely negligible off it .",
    "we have also studied four - body processes like @xmath84 .",
    "these cross - sections are too small even at ilc , and is without any hope of detection .",
    "clic may do a better job , since these channels , mediated mostly by fusion of @xmath0 vector bosons , rise with @xmath85 .",
    "the first channel may have a cross - section of 14 fb at @xmath86 tev .",
    "the signal process is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
    "remember that these @xmath1s must be soft .",
    "for example , with @xmath89 tev , @xmath90 gev , @xmath80 , @xmath91 , and @xmath67 gev , the maximum energy of the @xmath18 @xmath1s coming from @xmath40 decay is about 12 gev .",
    "this value is sensitive to the excited scalar-@xmath1 mass splitting , which in turn depends on @xmath23 .",
    "the sm background mostly comes from @xmath92-pair production , both of which decays to @xmath1 leptons and @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "these leptons are generally hard , and this background can effectively be put under control if we apply an upper energy cut of 12 - 15 gev to the @xmath1 leptons .",
    "a subdominant background comes from @xmath38 pair production , where one of them decays to @xmath93 and the other one decays invisibly .",
    "such backgrounds may be eliminated by reconstructing the @xmath38 .",
    "similar considerations apply for 3 - 4 @xmath1 signals , where a reconstruction can effectively eliminate such backgrounds .",
    "another prominent source of sm background is the @xmath94 events , where @xmath95s originate from the initial electron - positron pair which go undetected down the beam pipe @xcite .",
    "the @xmath96 production cross section is @xmath97 pb . about half of these events results in final state @xmath27 pair as visible particles .",
    "the background @xmath93 pairs are usually quite soft and coplanar with the beam axis .",
    "an acoplanarity cut significantly removes this background .",
    "such a cut , we have checked , does not appreciably reduce our signal .",
    "for example , excluding events which deviate from coplanarity within 40 mrad reduces only 7% of the signal cross section .",
    "in fact , current designs of ilc envisage very forward detectors to specifically capture the ` would - be - lost ' @xmath27 pairs down the beam pipe    the ued backgrounds are more severe .",
    "there are at least three two - body processes which can potentially swamp the signal : @xmath98 and @xmath99 . among them",
    "the @xmath76 pair production cross - section is largest @xcite : at @xmath90 gev , this is approximately 540 fb for @xmath89 tev .",
    "since @xmath76 must decay through leptonic channels , the cross - section for getting two @xmath1s plus missing energy in the final state is about 60 fb .",
    "this can come from two different subprocesses : @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( remember that @xmath0 neutrinos are invisible ) . whether one can apply a suitable upper energy cut depends on the precise position of these higgses , _",
    "i.e. _ , on @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath91 and @xmath90 gev , the @xmath1s coming from @xmath76 can have energies ranging from @xmath102 to 48 gev .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1s coming from @xmath69 are softer , between @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev .",
    "thus , one can avoid the @xmath76-background by putting an upper cut at @xmath104 gev .",
    "this method fails completely if @xmath23 is large and positive , say @xmath105 gev@xmath26 ; the reason is that @xmath69 becomes more massive , almost degenerate with @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , we have no way to guess the value of @xmath23 beforehand , so even the @xmath92-background removal is quite difficult .",
    "similar backgrounds also come from @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the first one is about five times smaller than the @xmath76 pair production rate , but the decay nature of @xmath108 ( only to leptons ) make the @xmath109 background about one - fourth as significant as the other . @xmath76 and @xmath108 being almost degenerate , the energies of the @xmath1s are going to be similar .",
    "a much smaller background comes from @xmath110 channel .",
    "a more serious background comes from the excited @xmath1 ( @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) pair production through @xmath21-channel photon or @xmath38 ( unless one sits precisely on the @xmath111 or @xmath83 resonances , their contribution can be neglected ) .",
    "the @xmath58 pair production cross - section is about 100 fb for @xmath90 gev , and slightly less for @xmath57 .",
    "( the difference is due to their couplings with @xmath38 . )",
    "it falls with increasing @xmath19 , but so does the @xmath40 production rate .",
    "the excited @xmath1s decay only to normal @xmath1s emitting an lkp , so the background is identical to the signal , even in angular distribution .",
    "again , @xmath23 plays an important role : for @xmath91 , @xmath58 backgrounds can be removed by an identical mechanism to that of @xmath76 .",
    "however , the @xmath57 background is impossible to remove , or even to reduce significantly .",
    "we show , in figures 5 and 6 , the possible range of @xmath1 energies coming from @xmath76 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath69 , for two values of @xmath23 : 0 and 5000 gev@xmath26 .",
    "this seems to be almost a no - go : if @xmath76 and @xmath58 backgrounds can be removed , one gets stuck at @xmath57 , or vice versa . for one of the most favorable situations ( @xmath90 gev , @xmath80 , @xmath91 , and @xmath67 gev ) , the signal , after providing optimum cuts , is at about @xmath112 level , assuming that we know @xmath23 beforehand , which is an impossibility ( unless there is some theoretical model ) .",
    "one way out may be to use the muon channel , @xmath113 , coming from the production of excited muons only , as a calibration and look for excess events in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "there is also a case where the @xmath1s coming from @xmath0 higgs decays can not even be detected .",
    "this happens when @xmath114 is close to @xmath115 .",
    "all the excited scalars will lie close to the lkp , and the @xmath1s will be so soft as to avoid detection . of course , it may so happen that the @xmath1-window is completely closed for @xmath69 , which should then decay to @xmath116 with a much longer lifetime .",
    "thus , there are three levels of challenge .",
    "first , to have a theoretical prediction for @xmath23 , perhaps from some more fundamental theory .",
    "this appears impossible at present , but we will try to get a bound on @xmath23 in the next section .",
    "second is to detect the soft @xmath1s , which , hopefully , is not a major problem ; one can expect @xmath1s with energy more than @xmath117 - 2 gev to be detected at the ilc .",
    "the third , which is the most challenging , is the observation of the excited scalar sector .",
    "since the radiative correction to the excited scalar masses is universal in nature , it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ radcorhiggs ] ) that among those scalars , @xmath40 will be the lowest - lying one . for sufficiently negative values of @xmath23 , the @xmath69 mass can go down below that of @xmath55 , the lkp , and this sets the lower bound on @xmath23 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath22 .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the minimum allowed value of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath51 .",
    "these curves are not overly sensitive to the precise value of @xmath118 ; the dependence is shown in fig .",
    "since @xmath23 can not have a large negative value , for most of the parameter space the @xmath1 window will remain open .",
    "however , it can have large positive values . for such values , the excited higgs masses may go above the corresponding electroweak gauge boson masses .",
    "this will open up a new set of decay channels , like @xmath119 .",
    "they are comparable to the two - body channels , since the coupling is a gauge one , not yukawa .",
    "the final state may not have any @xmath1-lepton in them . since @xmath76 lies below the excited quarks",
    ", the final state must be hadronically quiet .",
    "also note that for large values of @xmath19 and a heavy sm higgs boson , the lower limit on @xmath23 may turn out to be positive .",
    "however , this region is mostly outside the reach of ilc .",
    "is it possible to measure @xmath23 from precision studies at ilc ?",
    "for that matter , let us look at the most promising channel , pair production of @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "9 we show how the cross - section changes for different values of @xmath23 .",
    "the change is perceptible but may be too small for an experimental detection ( also note that the curves are drawn for a favourable point in the parameter space , we may not be so lucky ) .",
    "the problem is further aggravated by the fact that most of the energy in the final state is missing , so it is almost impossible to reconstruct the @xmath69 invariant mass . since leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons",
    "do not feel the effect of @xmath23 , we conclude that this is one parameter likely to remain unknown .",
    "in this paper we have focussed on the possible production , decay , and detection for the @xmath0 excited scalar sector of the universal extra dimension model .",
    "these scalars will , with almost 100% branching ratio , decay to soft @xmath18 @xmath1 leptons , accompanied by huge missing energy .",
    "once a ued - type new physics is established at the lhc and subsequently at the ilc ( by the study of kk leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) , it seems imperative to study the scalar sector , at least to determine the third and last input parameter to this model , namely , @xmath23 , the boundary mass squared term for the higgs boson .",
    "unfortunately , such a thing is easier said than done . by itself ,",
    "the soft @xmath1 detection is a challenge , but most likely it will be overcome at both lhc and ilc .",
    "the problem is to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "the sm backgrounds can be removed by judiciously choosing the cuts , but the backgrounds coming from other ued processes ( pair production of @xmath76 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath121 , etc . )",
    "are more difficult to handle . for most of the parameter space ,",
    "such processes give identical signals as the excited scalar production , and with almost identical energies and angular distribution .",
    "thus , it needs a precision study to detect those scalars , and can be performed only at ilc , or clic .",
    "one may use the excited muon channel as a calibration .",
    "the best channel to look for is the charged scalar pair production , for which the signal may just be detected .",
    "thus , @xmath23 seems to be one of the most challenging parameter to extract .",
    "one can , of course , get a theoretical lower bound on @xmath23 , stemming from the fact that among all the scalars , @xmath69 is the lowest - lying , and for sufficiently large negative values of @xmath23 , it can go down below @xmath115 and become the lkp .",
    "this sets a lower bound on this term , which is large and negative for most of the parameter space that can be probed at ilc .",
    "however , this bound can even be positive for large values of @xmath19 and a large sm higgs mass .",
    "one can say more about this bound once the sm higgs boson is detected at the lhc .",

    "he also thanks the theoretical physics division of universitt dortmund , where a part of the work was done , for hospitality .",
