    "_ discrete tomography _ is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving information about some discrete object from ( generally noisy ) information about its incidences with certain query sets .",
    "a typical example is the _ reconstruction _ of a finite point set from its line sums in a small number @xmath0 of directions .",
    "the term @xmath1-ray ( or @xmath1-ray projection ) is a _",
    "generic _ name here which stands for a mechanism that produces _ weighted _ projection data .",
    "more precisely , a ( discrete parallel ) @xmath1-ray of a finite subset of euclidean @xmath2-space @xmath3 in direction @xmath4 gives the number of points in the set on each line in @xmath3 parallel to @xmath4 .",
    "( this concept should not be misunderstood in the sense of diffraction theory , where @xmath1-rays provide rather different information on the underlying structure that is based on statistical pair correlations ; compare with  guinier ( 1994 ) , cowley ( 1995 ) and fewster ( 2003 ) . )    many papers focus on the discrete tomography of subsets of lattices since lattices are good models for crystalline structures",
    ". however , nature provides us also with _ structured _ non - lattice sets , the so - called _",
    "quasicrystals_. in the present paper , we shall investigate the discrete tomography of systems of _ aperiodic order _",
    ", more precisely , of so - called _ model sets _ ( or _ mathematical quasicrystals _ ) , which are commonly accepted as a mathematical model for perfect quasicrystalline structures in nature  ( steurer , 2004 ) .",
    "as model sets possess a ` dimensional hierarchy ' , which means that any model set in @xmath2 dimensions can be sliced into model sets of dimension @xmath5 , solving the reconstruction problem for two - dimensional systems with aperiodic order lies at the heart of solving the corresponding problem in three dimensions .",
    "the main motivation for our interest in the discrete tomography of model sets comes from the demand of materials science to reconstruct three - dimensional ( quasi)crystals or planar layers of them from their images obtained with quantitative _ high resolution transmission electron microscopy _ ( hrtem ) in a small number of directions .",
    "in fact , in  schwander _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) and kisielowski _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) , the technique quantitem ( quantitative analysis of the information coming from transmission electron microscopy ) is described , which is based on hrtem and can effectively measure the number of atoms lying on lines parallel to certain directions . at present",
    ", the measurement of the number of atoms lying on a line can only be achieved for some crystals ; see  schwander _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) and kisielowski _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) . however , it is reasonable to expect that future developments in technology will improve this situation .    roughly speaking , planar model sets are projections of certain subsets depending on some _ window _ @xmath6 of a higher dimensional lattice into the plane . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we will define model sets in general , but we will mainly restrict ourselves to a well - known class of _ planar _ model sets , the _ cyclotomic model sets_. on the one hand , cyclotomic model sets exhibit a particularly nice and useful algebraic structure , while on the other hand real - world quasicrystals can be sliced into parallel planar layers that can be modeled by cyclotomic model sets  ( pleasants , 2000 ) . also , in a certain sense , cyclotomic model sets can be seen as a direct generalization of the square lattice @xmath7 , the classical planar setting of discrete tomography .    naturally , all classic issues of discrete tomography including uniqueness , reconstruction and stability ( see _ e.g. _ the book by herman & kuba ( 1999 ) and , in particular , the papers by gardner & gritzmann ( 1997 ) , ( gritzmann _ et al . _",

    "( 2001 ) and alpers & gritzmann ( 2006 ) ) can be studied for model sets as , in principle , they are just different ground sets , for the potential solutions . as it turns out , however , the more general setting does disclose some new aspects , and the present paper will stress these . in particular , it is a priori not even clear how to decide whether a translate of a given finite point set occurs within an aperiodic structure .    as a matter of fact",
    ", previous studies have focussed on the ` anchored ' case that the underlying ground set is located in a linear space , i.e. , in a space with a specified location of the origin .",
    "the @xmath1-ray data is then taken with respect to this localization .",
    "this assumption is mainly justified by the fact that , as point sets , one has the equality @xmath8 for all @xmath9 .",
    "hence , in the lattice case , one can always assume that  if a solution exists ",
    "it is close to the origin . in the affine and aperiodic",
    "case of planar model sets it is a priori not clear how far out solutions may exist and how one can systematically search for them .    the main result of this paper is , however , that for cyclotomic model sets ( coming from polyhedral windows ) all possible localizations can be determined efficiently . in fact , we shall solve a corresponding _ decomposition problem _ and a _ separation problem_. this will allow us to reduce tomographic problems such as reconstruction and uniqueness for cyclotomic model sets to the corresponding classical problems with certain restrictions .",
    "one difference is manifest in the fact that potential solutions are subsets of a finite list of patches , whose number typically grows polynomially in the size .",
    "in fact , using the algebraic and the geometric structure of cyclotomic model sets we show that in a well - defined way the algorithmic methods that have been developed for the lattice case can be extended to the discrete tomography of cyclotomic model sets .",
    "( note , however , as a warning that even in the ( linear ) lattice case @xmath7 these problems are @xmath10-hard for three or more lattice directions ; see  gritzmann _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) and gardner _",
    "( 1999 ) . )",
    "let us be more specific . by using the minkowski representation of algebraic number fields ,",

    "( here , and in the following a subset @xmath18 of @xmath19 is said to _ live on _ a subgroup @xmath20 of @xmath19 if its difference set @xmath21 is a subset of @xmath20 . obviously , this is equivalent to the existence of a suitable @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . )",
    "the @xmath24-module @xmath13 $ ] is the ring of integers in the @xmath15th cyclotomic field @xmath25 , and , for @xmath26 , when viewed as a subset of the plane , is dense ; see section [ sec2 ] for details .",
    "in contrast , ( cyclotomic ) model sets @xmath27 are _ delone sets _ , i.e. , they are uniformly discrete and relatively dense .",
    "in fact , model sets are even _ meyer sets _ , meaning that also @xmath28 is uniformly discrete ; see  ( moody , 2000 ) .",
    "it turns out that , excepting the cyclotomic model sets living on @xmath13 $ ] with @xmath29 ( these are exactly the translations of the square and the triangular lattice , respectively ) , cyclotomic model sets @xmath27 are _ aperiodic _ , meaning that they have no translational symmetries .",
    "well - known examples with @xmath30-fold cyclic symmetry are the vertex sets of the square tiling ( @xmath31 ) , the triangle tiling ( @xmath32 ) , the ammann - beenker tiling ( @xmath33 ) , the tbingen triangle tiling ( @xmath34 ) and the shield tiling ( @xmath35 ) , respectively ; see below for details .",
    "observe that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are standard cyclic symmetries of genuine planar quasicrystals  ( steurer , 2004 ) .    whether or not one has future applications in materials science of quasicrystals in mind , the starting point will always be a specific structure model .",
    "this means that the specific type of the ( quasi)crystal is known , and one is confronted with the @xmath1-ray data of an unknown finite subset of it .",
    "let us point out that the rotational orientation of the probe in an electron microscope can rather easily be ascertained in the diffraction mode , prior to taking images in the high - resolution mode , though a natural choice of a translational origin is not possible .",
    "hence a first task is to ` localize ' a given probe within @xmath13 $ ] . to be more specific ,",
    "suppose @xmath1-rays of some planar ( quasi)crystalline set @xmath38 are taken in some directions @xmath39\\setminus\\{0\\}$ ] . obviously , every point of @xmath38 is ` registered ' by every @xmath1-ray image , hence @xmath38 is contained in the _ grid _",
    "@xmath40 see definition [ m - def : thegrid ] . of course",
    ", in general @xmath20 contains many more points than @xmath38 , hence does not disclose @xmath38 . on the other hand , only those subsets @xmath41 of @xmath20 whose @xmath1-rays coincide with the given data are feasible solutions which lie in a translate of the underlying model set .",
    "hence a first problem is to determine the decomposition of @xmath20 into the subsets which are compatible with the underlying @xmath24-module @xmath13 $ ] , i.e. , which lie in a common translate of @xmath13 $ ] ; see section [ m - sec : sec4 ] for details .",
    "this problem has its origin in the practice of quantitative hrtem since , in general , the @xmath1-ray information does not allow us to locate the underlying @xmath24-module @xmath13 $ ] . using standard results of algebra , we will actually show much more , namely that the solution of this _ decomposition problem _ only depends on @xmath15 and the given @xmath13$]-directions but not on the specific @xmath1-ray data .",
    "hence , conceptually , we can consider the different equivalence classes separately .",
    "of course , even if a @xmath13$]-equivalence class of the grid @xmath20 contains a set @xmath41 whose @xmath1-rays coincide with the given data , this set need not belong to the underlying cyclotomic model set .",
    "hence it is clear that additional constraints that are induced by the construction rules of the underlying model set have to be satisfied to guarantee feasibility .",
    "one possible approach could be to first reconstruct a potential solution that is compatible with the given @xmath1-ray data and then check whether it actually belongs to the underlying model set .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not lead to an efficient algorithm ( see remark [ m - rem : firstsep ] ) .",
    "therefore , we use the specific structure of model sets ( originating from some window through a projection process ) and determine which subsets of @xmath20 can possibly arise .",
    "in fact , all possible solutions ( that might actually lie ` far out ' in the defining model set ) can be found and explored by translating the given window ; see section [ m - sec : sec4 ] .",
    "for many types of windows , this _ separation problem _ can be handled by geometric techniques based on the theory of arrangements ; see section [ m - sec : results ] .",
    ".2 cm the present paper is organized as follows .    as a service to the reader , we begin with two preliminary sections that put together the notions required and recall several tools from algebra and the mathematical theory of quasicrystals . in fact",
    ", the algebra is needed not only to properly explain cyclotomic model sets but is crucial for devising algorithms for checking containment of points in this structure and also yields best - known bounds for the running time of our basic algorithms .",
