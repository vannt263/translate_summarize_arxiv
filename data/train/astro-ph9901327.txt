    "in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , a neutron star or black hole primary accretes material from its late - type companion star , producing intense x - ray emission .",
    "lmxbs can be divided into subclasses according to location within the galaxy , accretion characteristics , and luminosity ( _ e.g. _ van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "the `` bright galactic bulge '' sources ( gbs ) are located within @xmath3 longitude and @xmath4 latitude of the galactic centre ( see _ e.g. _ warwick _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) and are among the most luminous x - ray sources in the galaxy ( typical @xmath5 @xmath6erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the gbs have shown no x - ray bursts and attempts to detect orbital variability have been unsuccessful , suggesting that their periods may be longer than those of canonical lmxbs ( charles & naylor 1992 , hereafter cn92 ) .",
    "in addition , heavy obscuration in the galactic centre region has made optical study of the gbs nearly impossible .",
    "there are as yet no observations which explain the dichotomy between the poorly understood gbs and the rest of the lmxbs .",
    "the most likely theories suggest that the secondary stars in the gbs are late - type giants , in contrast to the quasi - main sequence stars in other lmxbs .",
    "however , the infrared provides us with an ideal window for observing these systems .",
    "the ir has two primary advantages : the late - type secondaries in lmxbs are brighter relative to the accretion discs , and , more importantly for the gbs , the ratio of @xmath8- to @xmath9-band extinction is nearly 10 ( naylor , charles , & longmore 1991 , hereafter ncl91 ) . over the past eight years , we have developed a program of ir observations of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , beginning with the discovery via colours or variability of candidates for the ir counterparts to the x - ray sources using precise x - ray and radio locations ( ncl91 ) . following this photometric survey we began an ir spectroscopic survey of lmxbs . in 1995",
    "we obtained ir spectra of the lmxb sco x-1 and the gbs systems gx1 + 4 and gx13 + 1 ; these results were published in bandyopadhyay _",
    "( 1997 ) , hereafter paper i.    continuing our spectroscopic survey of lmxbs , in this paper we present new results obtained from ukirt in 1997 . in paper",
    "i , we presented a @xmath10spectrum of the prototype lmxb sco x-1 taken in 1992 with an older , low resolution array and a short integration time .",
    "we have now observed sco x-1 at higher resolution and with a substantially longer exposure time .",
    "we have also obtained the first @xmath9-band spectrum of the ir counterpart to the gbs sco x-2 ( gx 349 + 2 ) , which was initially identified with a variable radio source ( cooke & ponman 1991 ) ; variability in the @xmath11-band counterpart was later found by wachter & margon ( 1996 ) . in paper",
    "i we presented a spectrum of the heavily obscured gbs gx13 + 1 which confirmed the identity of the ir counterpart .",
    "we now present a new spectrum of this source which clearly shows the co bands and metal lines of its late - type secondary .",
    "finally , we have obtained ir spectra of candidate stars within the x - ray / radio error circles of the gbs gx5 - 1 , gx17 + 2 , and the lmxb 4u2129 + 47 .",
    "we obtained @xmath9-band ( 2.002.45 @xmath0 m ) spectra using the cooled grating spectrometer ( cgs4 ) on the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope on mauna kea during the nights of 1997 july 1 - 3 ut .",
    "the 75 l / mm grating was used with the 150 mm camera and the 256@xmath12256 pixel insb array .",
    "target observations were bracketed by observations of a - type stars for removal of telluric atmospheric features .",
    "a journal of observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "the standard procedure of oversampling was used to minimise the effects of bad pixels ( wright 1995 ) .",
    "the spectra were sampled over two pixels by mechanically shifting the array in 0.5 pixel steps in the dispersion direction , giving a full width half maximum resolution of 34   ( @xmath13460 @xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7at 2.25 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "we employed the non - destructive readout mode of the detector in order to reduce the readout noise .",
    "the slit width was 1.23 arcseconds which corresponds to 1 pixel on the detector . in order to compensate for the fluctuating atmospheric emission lines we took relatively short exposures and nodded the telescope so that the object spectrum switched between two different spatial positions on the detector .",
    "for some objects , the slit was rotated from its default north - south position to avoid contamination of the target spectrum by nearby stars .",
    "details of the design and use of cgs4 can be found in mountain _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    ".journal of observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     first we determined the velocity shift of the spectrum of gx13 + 1 with respect to each template star spectrum by the method of cross - correlation ( tonry & davis 1979 ) .",
    "we then performed an optimal subtraction between each template star and the gx13 + 1 spectrum .",
    "the optimal subtraction routine minimizes the residual scatter between the target and template spectra by adjusting a constant @xmath14 , which represents the fraction of light contributed by the template star .",
    "the scatter is measured by carrying out the subtraction and then computing the between the resultant spectrum and a smoothed version of itself .",
    "the constant @xmath14 is therefore the fraction of light arising from the secondary star .",
    "the optimal values of @xmath14 are obtained by minimizing .    for this analysis we used a variety of giant and subgiant templates , ranging from g5 to m4 .",
    "the optimal subtraction was performed in the spectral range 2.282.39 @xmath0 m in order to encompass the first four @xmath15co bands , which are the most prominent absorption features in the gx13 + 1 spectrum .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in table 5 .",
    "the minimum occurs for a k5iii companion star , where the secondary contributes about 45% of the flux at @xmath132.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the result of the optimal subtraction of the k5iii template from the gx13 + 1 spectrum .",
    "we note that the large ir variability which was observed by cn92 ruled out the possibility of the ir flux arising primarily from the mass - donating star ; in other words , if the disc contribution to the ir flux was small , then we would expect the ir magnitude of gx13 + 1 to remain largely constant ( as it does in gx1 + 4 ) .",
    "the substantial ir variability ( @xmath13  1 mag at @xmath9 ) indicates that we should expect x - ray heating of the disc and secondary to be a major contributor to the ir flux from the system .",
    "the result of our optimal subtraction , which indicates that the k5iii secondary contributes less than half of the @xmath9-band flux , is completely consistent with this expectation .",
    "the ratio of the equivalent widths of @xmath15co to @xmath16co depends upon luminosity class ( see _ e.g. _ dhillon & marsh 1995 ) , ranging from 90 in main sequence stars to @xmath1310 in giants ( campbell _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) . to obtain a rough estimate of this ratio in gx13 + 1 , we measured equivalent widths by first establishing the continuum as a linear function between marked points on either side of each feature .",
    "the flux was then determined by summing the pixels within the marked area and subtracting the continuum .",
    "measurement of the ratio of the most clearly resolved @xmath15co and @xmath16co pair , the ( 2,0 ) bandheads , yielded a value of @xmath139 , which is comparable to that expected for a field giant and inconsistent with a main sequence secondary .",
    "in addition to the absorption features from the secondary , the br @xmath2 line in our gx13 + 1 spectrum exhibits a prominent p cygni profile .",
    "similarly to sco x-1 , using the emission lines we have estimated the radial velocity of gx13 + 1 as well as measuring the location of the profile edges ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the inferred wind velocity , @xmath13  2400@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 , is similar to that calculated for sco x-1 ; as in sco x-1 , the outflow probably originates in the disc rather than the mass - donating star .",
    "a high resolution spectrum of the br @xmath2 line is necessary to obtain accurate information about the outflow in this system .",
    "there have been several attempts at finding an orbital period in gx13 + 1 .",
    "( 1996 ) have observed a possible 12.6@xmath171 day modulation , while corbet ( 1996 ) has reported a 25.2d period in the gx13 + 1 xte asm light curve .",
    "we note that the groot _",
    "et al . _ period is half of that found by corbet .",
    "in contrast , wachter ( 1996 ) found some evidence for a 19.5h periodicity in @xmath9-band photometric data . using paczynski s formula for a roche lobe filling star and an orbital period @xmath18  =  25.2d , the mean density for the secondary would be 0.0003@xmath6g@xmath6@xmath19 ; for a giant , this density corresponds to an approximate spectral type of k5 .",
    "the k5iii spectral type we find for the secondary in gx13 + 1 therefore correlates well with the reported 25.2d period , and supports the possible identification of this period as an orbital modulation .",
    "in addition , the low @xmath20 ratio in gx13 + 1 , possibly the result of having a large region involved in x - ray reprocessing ( _ i.e. _ a large disc ) , also reinforces the probability of a long orbital period in this system ( cn92 ) .",
    "our spectrum rules out an orbital period of 19.5h , which would be insufficient to contain the orbital separation of a 1.4  neutron star and a roche lobe filling k5iii companion ( @xmath21  5 , @xmath22  25 ; allen 1973 ) .",
    "the nature of the 19.5h periodicity is therefore unclear .    using an apparent @xmath9 magnitude of 12 ( cn92 ) and an absolute magnitude @xmath23 = -3.8 for a k5iii star ( allen 1973 ; koorneef 1983 ) , together with a colour excess of @xmath24 = 5.7 ( van paradijs 1995 )",
    ", we find a distance to gx13 + 1 of 6.9 kpc .",
    "there are several published estimates for the reddening ( @xmath25 ) of gx13 + 1 , ranging from @xmath1317.6 to @xmath1313.2 ( see the discussion in cn92 ) , leading to an uncertainty in our distance calculation of approximately 1 kpc .",
    "therefore we adopt a value of 7@xmath171 kpc for the distance to gx13 + 1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the previous estimate of 8 - 9 kpc , which was based upon the mean distance to the galactic centre and has been used generally as an estimate for the distances to all of the gbs ( see _ e.g. _ naylor & podsiadlowski 1993 ) .      on the basis of their x - ray properties , lmxbs",
    "have been divided into two classes , known as @xmath26 and atoll sources from the shape of their x - ray colour - colour diagrams ( see van der klis 1995 for a review ) .",
    "gx13 + 1 has been classified as an atoll ( less luminous ) source ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 , hereafter hk89 ) , although earlier studies placed gx13 + 1 into the category with the @xmath26 ( high luminosity ) sources ( _ e.g. _ white , stella , & parmar 1988 ) .",
    "hk89 suggested that the evolutionary history of the @xmath26 and atoll lmxbs could account for their observational differences , with the @xmath26 sources having evolved secondaries and hence long orbital periods ( @xmath2715h ) whereas the atoll sources would have main sequence secondaries and @xmath285h .",
    "all of the proposed orbital periods found to date in gx13 + 1 are substantially longer than the @xmath135h periods predicted for an atoll source and in fact are similar to the periods found in the @xmath26 sources sco x-1 and cyg x-2 .",
    "additionally , our spectrum shows unequivocally that the mass - donating companion in gx13 + 1 is an evolved late - type star , making a @xmath135h orbital period impossible .",
    "there are several possibilities for resolving the discrepancy between the observed nature of gx13 + 1 and the predictions arising from the @xmath26/atoll classification scheme .",
    "first , gx13 + 1 may be mis - classified as an atoll source .",
    "both the high x - ray luminosity of gx13 + 1 and the detection of radio flux from the source are more typical of the luminous @xmath26 lmxbs than atoll sources ; additionally , a @xmath1360hz qpo has recently been found ( homan _ et al .",
    "however , its colour - colour diagram is not consistent with the x - ray properties of the six known @xmath26 sources .",
    "a second possibility is that the existence of `` hybrid '' systems such as gx13 + 1 , gx9 + 9 , and gx9 + 1 , which exhibit both @xmath26 and atoll characteristics , should be considered as a third `` intermediate '' class of objects where the @xmath26 and atoll classes overlap ( _ e.g. _ kuulkers & van der klis 1998 ) . finally , it is possible that the evolutionary distinction between @xmath26 and atoll lmxbs does not arise from a straightforward dichotomy between evolved and main sequence secondaries .",
    "for example , some systems could have evolved companions but lower accretion rates and/or weaker magnetic fields than canonical @xmath26 sources . in this case",
    ", sources could exhibit atoll - type x - ray properties as well as long periods ; in addition to gx13 + 1 , the atoll source ac 211 ( @xmath29 = 17.1h ) could fit into such a category ( van der klis 1992 ) .",
    "it would then become difficult to make predictions about the orbital period and nature of the companion star in a given system purely on the basis of its x - ray behaviour .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath26/atoll evolutionary dichotomy _ could _ still arise from fundamental differences in the types of mass - donating star in the two classes , but in a more specific manner than a simple division between evolved and main sequence companions .      in figures 6 and 7",
    "we show the spectra obtained of candidate ir counterparts to the gbs gx5 - 1 and gx17 + 2 and the lmxb 4u2129 + 47 .",
    "to date , no ir counterpart has been confirmed for any of these elusive lmxbs .",
    "other than sco x-1 , gx5 - 1 is the brightest of the persistent lmxbs , but no x - ray periodicity has been found nor has an ir counterpart been identified ( van der klis _",
    ". an _ einstein _",
    "x - ray position and a precise radio position exist for gx5 - 1 , but candidates for the ir counterpart to this heavily obscured source only become visible at @xmath9 ( see _ e.g. _ the finding charts in ncl91 ) .",
    "we obtained spectra of the two stars closest to the radio error circle , designated by ncl91 as stars 502 and 503 .",
    "neither of the spectra , shown in figure 6 , show any evidence for the signature br @xmath2 emission we would expect in an lmxb .",
    "both stars 502 and 503 are faint , with @xmath9 magnitudes of @xmath1314 and @xmath1315 respectively ( ncl91 ) ; combined with the relatively short integration time ( 16 min on each source ) , the generally poor quality of the two spectra ( s / n @xmath13  3 ) is unsurprising .",
    "however , in such a bright x - ray source , we might expect the emission lines from the disc to be especially strong ; while not conclusive , our spectra therefore cast doubt on the potential of either of these two stars to be the ir counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "we note that there is a star northeast of star 502 ( designated as star 513 by ncl91 ) which also lies within the radio error circle of gx5 - 1 and as such is also a prime candidate for the ir counterpart . due to",
    "the star s extreme faintness ( @xmath30 ) , we did not obtain a spectrum for this candidate .",
    "obtaining photometric and spectroscopic information on star 513 should therefore be a primary objective for future ir observations of gx5 - 1 .      on the basis of its x - ray position ,",
    "the gbs gx17 + 2 was optically identified with a g star known as `` star tr '' more than 25 years ago ( tarenghi & reina 1972 ; davidsen , malina , & bowyer 1976 ) . the location of gx17 + 2 was further refined by a subarcsecond radio position ( hjellming 1978 ) but the putative counterpart has shown almost no optical variability ( _ e.g. _ margon 1978 ) .",
    "we note , however , that deutsch _",
    "( 1996 ) have found a small discrepancy between the optical and radio positions of gx17 + 2 .",
    "the ir counterpart to star tr ( @xmath3114 ) has shown variability , but a consistent fit for the colours , extinction , distance , and spectral type could not be found ( ncl91 ) .",
    "based on the variety of x - ray periods which have been suggested for this source , bailyn & grindlay ( 1987 ) theorized that gx17 + 2 is a triple system , with a giant star in orbit around a short - period lmxb .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the extinctions derived from optical and x - ray measurements led ncl91 to conclude that star tr is a foreground star unassociated with the x - ray source which is superimposed upon a highly reddened ir counterpart to gx17 + 2 .",
    "our @xmath9-band spectrum , shown in the top panel of figure 7 , shows no evidence either for emission lines or absorption features from a late - type ir counterpart obscured by star tr .",
    "indeed , the featureless spectrum is consistent with an early g - type evolved star or a main sequence star earlier than g5 ( kh86 ) , as would be expected from star tr if it is an unassociated , foreground g star .",
    "therefore , our spectrum has too short an integration time and/or insufficient resolution to show features from a faint , variable ir counterpart to gx17 + 2 which may be partially hidden behind star tr .",
    "the neutron star lmxb 4u2129 + 47 is known to have an orbital period of 5.2h and has an optical counterpart , v1727 cyg ( thorstensen _ et al .",
    "radial velocity studies produced estimates for the masses of the compact object and secondary star of 0.6@xmath170.2  and 0.4@xmath170.2  respectively ( thorstensen & charles 1982 ) .",
    "then , after entering x - ray quiescence in 1983 , all evidence of photometric variability and radial velocity variations disappeared ( _ e.g. _ garcia _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , hereafter g89 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart visible during the low state is an f8iv ( cowley & schmidtke 1990 ) whose colours were initially observed to be inconsistent with a normal star ( kaluzny 1988 ) .",
    "however , subsequent observations failed to confirm this abnormality in the optical colours of the f star ( deutsch _ et al .",
    "g89 proposed that 4u2129 + 47 is a triple system , although it has also been suggested that the f star is a foreground source unassociated with the system .",
    "our @xmath9-band spectrum of the f star appears in the bottom panel of figure 7 .",
    "the spectrum is featureless ( the spike at @xmath132.05 @xmath0 m is a residual of the telluric absorption feature removal ) ; we see no indication of emission from an accretion disc , nor do we see any evidence for absorption features from the mv star suggested by g89 as a hypothetical third member of the triple system . however , we note that even in the @xmath9-band , the flux from a faint mv star would likely be obscured by the brighter f star .",
    "we have presented @xmath9-band spectra of the lmxbs sco x-1 , sco x-2 , and gx13 + 1 .",
    "the ir spectrum of sco x-1 exhibits the emission features expected from a luminous accretion disc but does not show any absorption features arising from the system secondary , reinforcing our conclusion that the secondary is a subgiant of spectral type g5 or earlier .",
    "the spectrum of the proposed counterpart to sco x-2 shows br @xmath2 emission from the accretion disc , confirming the identification .",
    "the @xmath9-band spectrum of gx13 + 1 exhibits both br @xmath2 emission and co absorption bands ; optimal subtraction indicates that the secondary in gx13 + 1 is most likely a k5iii , with the accretion disc contributing @xmath1350% of the @xmath9-band flux .",
    "in addition , the br @xmath2 emission lines in both sco x-1 and gx13 + 1 show p cygni profiles , indicating the presence of outflows in both systems with velocities @xmath132000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "spectra of two stars in the error circle of gx5 - 1 do not show the br @xmath2 emission signature which would identify the ir counterpart .",
    "similarly , spectra of the g star at the position of gx17 + 2 and the f star at the position of 4u2129 + 47 fail to exhibit any evidence that they are physically associated with the x - ray sources .",
    "it is interesting to note that while our gx13 + 1 spectrum clearly shows the features of the k giant secondary , neither sco x-1 nor sco x-2 appear to exhibit any spectral lines characteristic of late - type ( late g to m ) stars .",
    "significant similarities in the behaviour of sco x-1 and sco x-2 have also been seen in the optical and x - rays , indicating a fundamental similarity in the nature of the two systems .",
    "furthermore , the clear differences in these spectra occur _ despite _ the fact that gx13 + 1 , sco x-1 , and sco x-2 all have relatively long orbital periods and are luminous , persistent xrbs .",
    "far from supporting the idea that most of the gbs have late - type evolved secondaries , this result leads us to speculate that the mass - donating stars in sco x-1 and sco x-2 may prove to be very different than previously assumed .",
    "there have been two primary schemes proposed for the classification of lmxbs . in a statistical study of a flux - limited sample of lmxbs ,",
    "naylor and podsiadlowski ( 1993 , hereafter np93 ) asserted that the gbs distribution is associated with that of m giants in the galactic bulge .",
    "they classified sco x-1 , sco x-2 , and gx13 + 1 ( along with seven other xrbs ) as bulge sources on the basis of their location , the characteristics of their x - ray spectra , and the fact that they are persistent x - ray sources .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath26/atoll scheme categorizes lmxbs based on the shape of their x - ray colour - colour diagrams ( hk89 ) . with this method ,",
    "six of the sources classified as gbs by np93 , including sco x-1 and sco x-2 , are labelled as @xmath26-sources , whereas the remaining gbs , including gx13 + 1 , are placed in the atoll category .",
    "note that the @xmath26 and atoll sources appear to be randomly scattered amongst the bulge and disc populations categorized by np93 .",
    "hk89 suggested that a primary difference between the @xmath26 and atoll sources may originate with the mass - donating stars ; namely , that the @xmath26 sources have evolved secondaries while the atoll sources have main sequence companions .",
    "it is clear from our spectra that the dichotomy between @xmath26 and atoll sources can not be this straightforward , as both sco x-1 and gx13 + 1 have evolved secondaries .",
    "however , if the spectral type of the secondaries in sco x-1 and sco x-2 prove to be considerably earlier than the k giant found in gx13 + 1 , then the evolutionary scenarios of sco x-1 and sco x-2 are indeed likely to be quite distinct from sources such as gx13 + 1 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath26 source cyg x-2 has an evolved a9 companion ( casares , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) ; sco x-1 also has an evolved secondary of type earlier than g5 , and sco x-2 may be similar .",
    "we therefore hypothesize that the secondaries in the six @xmath26 sources may all be _ early - type evolved stars_. we speculate further that the distinction between the evolutionary history of the @xmath26 and atoll sources may not be that the former have evolved secondaries and the latter have main sequence companions , but instead that @xmath26 sources have _ evolved early - type _ companions while most other lmxbs have _ late type _ ( either evolved or main sequence ) secondaries . if this were the case , it may also help to explain why the ir counterparts for the other three @xmath26 sources ( gx5 - 1 , gx17 + 2 , and gx340 + 0 ) have proven so elusive ( although gx17 + 2 is a special case due to the foreground star ) .",
    "until now it has been assumed that the secondaries in these systems would be late - type evolved stars and therefore bright in the @xmath9 band ( @xmath32  4 ) . yet",
    "the few candidate stars found in deep @xmath9-band images of the gx5 - 1 and gx340 + 0 fields have failed to show photometric or spectroscopic evidence that they are in fact the counterparts . to elude detection",
    ", a late - type evolved counterpart would have to be at a greater distance than we believe from estimates of the x - ray column densities . however , if the secondaries in these systems are early - type stars ( with @xmath32  0 ) , then the counterparts would naturally be fairly faint in the @xmath9-band .",
    "it would then be unnecessary to invoke a significantly larger extinction and/or distance to these sources in order to explain our inability to locate their ir counterparts .",
    "our spectra provide clear evidence that neither the bulge / disc nor the @xmath26/atoll schemes can be explained by a simple distinction between evolved and main sequence secondary stars .",
    "however , we note that the early - type / late - type dichotomy proposed here _ could _",
    "fit into the @xmath26/atoll classification scheme _ without _ having to disregard the bulge / disc association made by np93 .",
    "although currently the evidence for this claim is limited , we believe that this hypothesis is well worth exploring .",
