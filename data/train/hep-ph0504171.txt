    "over the past few years , our knowledge of cp violation in particle physics has improved significantly .",
    "experiments have confirmed the so - called ckm paradigm , in that all the cp - violation processes measured with good precision in particle physics to date seem to be described by the cp - violating phase present in the ckm matrix .",
    "cp - violating phases are usually parametrized in the @xmath10 phase convention .",
    "we have two precise b - factory measurements of @xmath3 extracted from the cp asymmetries in @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 the current world average is @xmath13 , which translates to a value for @xmath3 of , @xmath14 the phase @xmath8 is not so well known .",
    "the first experimental result , which has been obtained at belle , is @xmath15 , while babar s preliminary result is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "both experiments have directly measured @xmath8 by studying the time - independent cp asymmetries in @xmath17 decays to @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the direct determination carries a large combined uncertainty ( statistical+systematic+model dependent ) of about @xmath20% to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "there are other methods to extract @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recently a new method has been proposed that makes use of an scet analysis of the @xmath22 decays .",
    "while this method reduces the theoretical uncertainty of the final result , the experimental error remains large @xcite .",
    "these measurements are compatible with the indirect determination through ckm global fits @xcite and earlier constraints developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provide approximately the following value for the phase @xmath8 at @xmath23 c.l .",
    ", @xmath24    regarding the phase @xmath25 , although none of the decays @xmath26 used for the determination of @xmath27 @xcite gives a precise number , the combination of the three modes @xcite gives a result that is in agreement with the value obtained from ckm global fits @xcite .",
    "the latter , combining statistical and systematic uncertainities , is approximately , @xmath28 it is the main goal of any theory of flavor to explain the measured cp phases , as well as the ckm elements and fermion mass ratios",
    ". it may be useful when searching for a fundamental theory of flavor to know _ a priori _ if there is something special about the measured values of @xmath27 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 that could give us some clue regarding the origin of cp violation .",
    "let us suppose that we had experimental information on the absolute values of the ckm elements but not on the cp - violating phases .",
    "we could then expect that the hierarchies observed in the absolute values of the ckm elements would constrain the range of possible values for the cp phases .",
    "the question is the following : are the measured values of @xmath3 and @xmath8 a special pair out of all the possible values compatible with the measured absolute values of the ckm elements ? it is the main purpose of this short paper to argue that this may be the case .",
    "we will show that the measured value of @xmath3 is approximately the maximum allowed by the measured absolute values of the ckm elements . in sec .",
    "[ alter ] we will introduce an alternative parametrization of the ckm matrix , which helps to make our point more clear . in sec .  [ maxb ] we will give a simple formula for the maximum value of @xmath3 and compare the numerical results with the measurements . in sec .",
    "[ prospects ] we will briefly comment on near - future prospects for testing the maximality of @xmath3 .",
    "it is convenient for the subsequent discussion to adopt the following alternative parametrization of the ckm matrix .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath29 can be expressed to leading order as a function of three real parameters @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32 and a complex phase @xmath8 , @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{ckmcp}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath31 is given to leading order by @xmath34 .",
    "we note that based on the experimental value for @xmath35 , the parameter @xmath31 is approximately @xmath36 .",
    "accordingly , in the previous parametrization the ckm matrix is unitary to order @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38",
    ". the parameter @xmath32 can be determined from the absolute values of the ckm elements .",
    "we find it convenient for the rest of the discussion to introduce a new parameter @xmath39 , which can be expressed as , @xmath40 it is easy to obtain the relation between the new parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the usual wolfenstein parametrization @xcite , @xmath44 the parameter @xmath1 can be determined from the measured absolute values of the ckm elements .",
    "using the values given by the pdg collaboration , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite , we obtain , @xmath48 using the newer and more precise value , @xmath49 @xcite , we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "it is a trivial check to prove that the angle @xmath8 introduced in the parametrization of the ckm matrix given in eq .",
    "[ ckmcp ] coincides with the standard definition , @xmath51 $ ] . using our parametrization for the ckm matrix",
    ", we obtain a simple expression for the leading - order relation between the angles @xmath3 and @xmath8 , @xmath52 =   { \\rm arg } \\left [ 1 - \\zeta e^{-i \\gamma}\\right ] \\label{betagamma}\\ ] ] if we consider @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 , we can determine the value of @xmath8 that maximizes @xmath3 , or in other words solve the equation @xmath53 .",
    "we find that at the maximum , @xmath54 where @xmath55 must be interpreted as the value of the phase @xmath8 that maximizes @xmath3 , and not the maximum value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition , @xmath56 thus , the maximality condition predicts not @xmath3 or @xmath8 but @xmath27 , @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the measured absolute values of the ckm elements indicate that @xmath57 .",
    "we can therefore expand the maximal @xmath3 solution in powers of @xmath1 around @xmath58 and obtain the following expression for the maximum , @xmath59 using the numerical value of @xmath1 as calculated in eq .",
    "[ zexp ] from the absolute values of the ckm elements , we obtain the following numerical values for the maximum , @xmath60 these values are close to the central measured value for @xmath3 and the global fit for @xmath8 given in eqs .  [ betaexp ] and [ gammaexp ] respectively .",
    "they can be observed graphically in figure [ fig : betagamma ] as the intersection between the diagonal line of maximum and the red sinusoidal strip .",
    "if we use the value of @xmath1 determined using the measured ratio for @xmath61 , we obtain a narrower strip that is shown as the hatched - yellow area in fig .",
    "[ fig : betagamma ] .      in some applications , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the ckm matrix play an important role .",
    "we are interested in calculating the effect that these corrections may have on the location of the maximum @xmath3 phase , as they may be crucial for testing the maximality of @xmath3 with precision . requiring unitarity to order @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 , we obtain , @xmath64 . \\label{ckmcpnlo}\\ ] ] we note that the parameter @xmath31 is determined from @xmath65 to nlo from @xmath66 .",
    "we can use the general definition of the @xmath3 phase given in eq .",
    "[ betagamma ] and expand in powers of @xmath1 and @xmath31 .",
    "we obtain the following expression for the maximal @xmath3 phase at nlo in the ckm matrix , @xmath67 where the parameter @xmath43 is related to @xmath1 and @xmath31 by , @xmath68 using the measured values of the ckm elements , we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "this translates to the following numerical values for the maximum at nlo , @xmath70 alternatively , assuming that @xmath3 is exactly maximal and using the experimental measurement @xmath7 , the phase @xmath8 is predicted to be @xmath9 .",
    "we would like to note that the approximate maximality of the @xmath3 phase was pointed out in the context of a particular yukawa ansatz in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the generality of this observation was not emphasized .",
    "the underlying flavor symmetry is broken at an energy scale much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore , the issue of the renormalization - scale evolution of the cp phases may be very relevant if @xmath3 is approximately maximal .",
    "the evolution equations for the entries of the ckm matrix have been known for quite a long time @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that using the measured hierarchies of the ckm elements simplifies these expressions considerably .",
    "the entries @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 receive an identical and sizeable correction given by , @xmath75 here @xmath76 for the sm , and @xmath77 for the mssm .",
    "this equation can be approximately solved to yield , @xmath78 therefore , @xmath79 can receive a correction of about @xmath80% in the sm and about @xmath81% in the mssm . on the other hand ,",
    "the entries @xmath82 and @xmath83 receive a tiny identical rge correction given by , @xmath84 this generates a correction to @xmath85 and @xmath83 , which in the sm and mssm is at most of the order , @xmath86 this amounts to a correction of about @xmath87% , which can be neglected for practical purposes .",
    "therefore @xmath85 and @xmath83 can be considered renormalization - scale independent . as a consequence , the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath32 are to a very good approximation renormalization - scale independent , and the ckm matrix at the scale @xmath88 , @xmath89 , adopts the same functional form as the electroweak scale ckm matrix , with the replacement @xmath90 . since the parameter @xmath31 does not enter into eq .",
    "[ betagamma ] , and the renormalization - scale dependence of @xmath91 and @xmath92 cancels in the definition of @xmath8 , we can claim that the cp phases are to leading order renormalization - scale independent .",
    "therefore , the maximality of @xmath3 is an approximately renormalization - scale independent fact that should be addressed by the theory of flavor , irrespective of the flavor breaking scale .",
    "the usual @xmath10 phase convention is just one particular convention out of a continuum of other possible conventions to parametrize the cp - violating phases in the sm .",
    "if we were using a different phase convention @xmath93 , it would be a certain combination of these phases that would become maximal , corresponding to the phase @xmath3 .",
    "although this would make it more difficult to notice the correlation , it would have the same observable implications .",
    "one may wonder whether this fact is physically relevant .",
    "is it just a coincidence that one of the phases , in the convention that became of common use for historical reasons , is maximal ?",
    "we note that even though all phase conventions are mathematically equivalent , a good choice must display simple relations to measurable quantities , and this may shed light on some important qualitative issues .",
    "for instance , in the standard convention , @xmath3 parametrizes cpv in the mixing of the two b - meson mass eigenstates .",
    "a related topic is the issue of maximal cp violation .",
    "it is known that the standard invariant measure of cp violation @xcite is given by the jarlskog parameter , @xmath94 $ ] ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) . using the parametrization given in eq .",
    "[ ckmcp ] we obtain , @xmath97 the jarlskog parameter is determined experimentally to be @xmath98 .",
    "substituting @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 determined from the measured absolute values of the ckm we obtain @xmath99 as the central value , which is fully consistent with the value provided by the current global fit .",
    "there are several definitions of maximal cp violation .",
    "originally , the term referred to the phase that maximizes @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this definition , however , is not well - defined , as it is phase - convention dependent .",
    "moreover , it would correspond to @xmath101 , which is in poor agreement with experiment , as was pointed out a long time ago .",
    "there have been a few proposals to define phase - convention independent parametrizations of maximal cp violation @xcite , which if true would predict an amount of cp violation much larger than is observed .",
    "what is relevant is that once the absolute values of the ckm elements have been fixed , the maximal @xmath3 hypothesis uniquely determines @xmath27 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 , as we have shown in the previous section .",
    "this has distinct observable implications that are phase - convention independent .",
    "we have used the current measured values of the ckm elements to determine the location of the maximal @xmath3 phase solution with about @xmath102 uncertainty .",
    "this has been shown to be consistent with the current measured value of @xmath3 , which carries an uncertainty of about @xmath103 . @xmath104 and @xmath65 are known at the @xmath105 and @xmath106 level , respectively .",
    "it is expected that the uncertainty in the experimental determination of @xmath107 will decrease in the near future from its present value of about @xmath108 to the present theoretical limit of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "such an improvement in the determination of @xmath107 would allow us to calculate the maximal @xmath3 phase and the corresponding @xmath8 phase with much better precision , about @xmath110 optimistically .",
    "the crucial test of the maximal-@xmath3 hypothesis will no doubt be provided by a precise determination of the phases @xmath8 and @xmath27 .",
    "the experimental situation looks favorable .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath8 is the next challenge for b factories .",
    "it is expected @xcite that if the luminosity in the upgraded b factories is high enough , @xmath8 could be determined with approximately @xmath103 percent uncertainty ; a measurement with an uncertainty at the level of @xmath111 will require a superb factory .",
    "a determination of @xmath27 at less than the @xmath103 level may also have to wait for the superb factories @xcite .",
    "solving a problem sometimes requires that one ask the right question . the question of why @xmath112 or the question of why @xmath113 are equally puzzling .",
    "these values of @xmath27 and @xmath3 are at first sight two seemingly arbitrary numbers . on the other hand , the observation that this is approximately equivalent to assuming that the phase @xmath3 is the maximum allowed by the measured absolute values of the ckm elements may give us a clue about the mechanism that determines the amount of cp violation measured in nature .",
    "if a mechanism exists in the underlying theory of flavor that selects the maximum allowed value of the phase @xmath3 , we can succesfully predict the measured cp violation once the hierarchies in the absolute values of the ckm elements are fixed .",
    "the maximality of @xmath3 , if confirmed with precision by future measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath27 , could be a guiding light in our search for a fundamental theory of flavor .",
