    "in the current framework of the @xmath4cdm cosmological model , the possibility that dark matter ( dm ) annihilation effects may impact stellar evolution has recently received renewed attention . after the original works of bouquet , dearborn , freese , gould , griest , krauss , olive , press , raffelt , renzini , salati , silk , spergel , srednicki and wilczek in the80s and early  90s , several authors have recently re  examined the effects that dm , if made of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , would have on compact objects @xcite and on the zero - age main sequence of low  mass stars @xcite .",
    "this exciting activity has been motivated by a double scope : any peculiar and distinguishable feature of wimp annihilation on observable stellar quantities is extremely precious in the `` quest '' for dark matter evidence ; on the other hand , all possible effects impacting the life of celestial objects must be taken into account by astrophysicists in the current precision era .    in particular , the first stellar episode at high redshift occurs under very different conditions from those in the present universe .",
    "the higher concentration of dark matter , the short hubble time which prevents dm self  annihilation from severely affecting the central density , and the characteristic formation of a single popiii star in the center of the halo are the most favorable conditions for dm annihilation effects to be very efficient in the first stars . in their pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite first found the possibility of very high dm density in primordial halos at high redshift to such an extent that energy released from dm annihilation at the center may halt the gravitational collapse of the baryonic cloud , calling such a dm powered object a _ dark _ star .",
    "* hereafter i08 ) and @xcite also noticed that wimp capture is most efficient in population iii stars .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite further investigated the role of annihilation of adiabatically contracted dm in the formation of the first stars .",
    "@xcite have also followed the evolution from the pre - main sequence phase to helium exhaustion in the presence of wimp capture and annihilation ( hereafter , dm burning ) , showing that this can severely delay the evolution of pre ",
    "ms objects in the early universe , as well as extend their ms lifetimes .",
    "all of these studies motivate us to explore possible consequences of dm burning for the final fate of the first stars and their feedback effects on the evolution of the early universe , even if the role of dm annihilation in the formation of the first stars still remains subject to many uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "in this letter , we address the issue by discussing the evolution of the first stars of @xmath5 up to the carbon burning stage ( sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) .",
    "we also investigate the interplay of rotation with dm burning in the evolution of the first stars of @xmath6 , given the particular importance of rotation for the evolution and deaths of metal poor massive stars ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "implications of our results for the history of reionization in the early universe are briefly discussed ( sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] ) .",
    "we have implemented the dm capture and annihilation process in a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code , following @xcite .",
    "the dm capture rate @xmath7 is calculated using gould s equations as reported in eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) of i08 . throughout this letter",
    "we assume the dm ",
    "baryon scattering cross section @xmath8 is @xmath9 for the spin - dependent scattering , to which only hydrogen is sensitive , and @xmath10 for the spin - independent one .",
    "these correspond to the current upper limits of wimp direct detection search  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same values for other parameters as those used in i08 to calculate @xmath7 , except for the ambient dm density ( see below ) .",
    "the wimps captured by a star eventually reach thermal equilibrium with the gas , in a configuration dictated by the gravitational potential : the consequent dm density can be given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are temperature and density at the stellar center , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the speed of light and boltmann s constant , respectively",
    ". the energy generation rate due to dm annihilation is given by @xmath17~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mass of the dm particle ; we assume it to be m@xmath19=100 gev , which is often taken as a fiducial value in astrophysical studies for dm search .",
    "we use @xmath20 , the value best fitting the relic dm abundance  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the factor @xmath21 is to consider that part of the energy is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "we consider the time dependent evolution of the total number of wimps ( @xmath22 ) in the star , and the number of thermally relaxed wimps in the core ( @xmath23 ) by the following equations in order to normalize @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the thermalization rate that can be approximated by @xmath27 see @xcite for detailed discussion on the thermalization time scale @xmath28 .",
    "our models show that equilibrium between @xmath7 and @xmath26 is well maintained up to the core helium burning phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below ) .",
    "we consider several different values for the ambient dm energy density @xmath0 ranging from 0 to @xmath29 .",
    "for the initial composition of the first stars , we assume the mass fractions of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be 0.76 , 0.23999 , and 0.00001 , respectively . the mass loss rate from metal free stars is assumed to be zero if the eddington factor @xmath33 is smaller than 0.84 and @xmath34 otherwise , following  @xcite .",
    "if a star becomes a helium star by rotationally induced mixing ( see below ) , we assume that the mass loss rate from such a metal free wolf - rayet ( wr ) star is the same as that from a corresponding wr star at @xmath35 , as implied by @xcite .",
    "the code also implements the transport of chemical species and angular momentum due to rotationally induced hydrodynamic instabilities and the spruit - tayler dynamo .",
    "other details on the stellar evolution code are described in @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the hr diagram of the constructed non  rotating first star models on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the luminosity for a given mass does not significantly change with varying @xmath0 .",
    "this represents the well  known nature of the mass  luminosity relation , which is largely independent of any particular mode of energy generation  @xcite .",
    "the stellar structure is adjusted such that the ratio of the nuclear to the dm luminosity decreases with increasing @xmath0 , while the total luminosity remains nearly constant , leading to prolonged lifetimes of the stars , our models give longer life times than those by @xcite .",
    "this is because these authors used an approximation for the dm capture rate @xmath7 , while we integrate eq ( 2 ) of i08 over the entire stellar structure . ]",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is above a critical value ( @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at a given stellar mass the central density and temperature decrease to such an extent that the stars would live forever on the zams , having no nuclear reactions .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with @xcite who find that pre ",
    "ms evolution is `` frozen '' before reaching the zams at high enough @xmath0 ; and with @xcite , who find ( for m@xmath374@xmath38 ) that stars move rightward of the zams locus on the hr , and eventually join the hayashi track , if `` fed '' with increasing dm annihilation luminosities .",
    "no meaningful change in the stellar structure according to different values of @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ) is observed in non - rotating models . since",
    "dm burning only occurs within a very small radius @xmath40 , stars with different @xmath0 at a given mass have similar amounts of energy flux from the core and produce helium cores of a similar size ( e.g. @xmath41 from @xmath6 stars ) .",
    "the luminosity resulting from dm burning gradually increases early on the main sequence as the star expands , but continuously decreases in later stages since the significant reduction of the number of hydrogen atoms lowers the dm capture rate .",
    "rapid increase of the stellar radius after helium exhaustion makes the thermalization time very long , leading to reduction of the number of thermalized wimps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the dm luminosity accordingly decreases further from @xmath42 to about @xmath43 during the carbon burning phase , in the given example with @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "carbon burning and particularly neutrino cooling ( @xmath44 ) dominate the evolution at this stage as shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "as the evolution of the star beyond carbon exhaustion should also be governed by neutrino cooling and other nuclear reactions such as oxygen burning , the effect of dm burning on the pre - supernova structure must be minor .",
    "as the situation remains similar in the other models of @xmath45 , we conclude that dm burning may not change the final fate of the non - rotating first stars .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that rotation can dramatically change the evolution with dm burning .",
    "fluids in rotating massive stars are subject to various rotationally induced hydrodynamic instabilities such as eddingon - sweet circulations , which can cause mixing of chemical species across the boundary between the hydrogen burning core and the radiative envelope .",
    "such mixing is usually stabilized by the strong buoyancy potential due to the chemical stratification between the hydrogen burning core and the envelope . however , if chemical mixing can occur faster than the building - up of chemical gradients by nuclear burning ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , then ( quasi- ) chemical homogeneity can be maintained on the main sequence ( so - called chemically homogeneous evolution )  @xcite .",
    "the condition , @xmath46 , can be met either by reducing @xmath47 or increasing @xmath48 .",
    "rapid rotation tends to do the former , and we find that dm burning tends to do the latter .",
    "this is because the mixing time scale due to eddington ",
    "sweet circulations remains almost unchanged with increasing @xmath0 ( for @xmath49 ) , while the nuclear burning time scale increases due to the dm burning .",
    "this explains the remarkable impact of dm burning in the evolution of our rotating models as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as shown in the upper panel , rotation in this model ( @xmath50 )",
    "is not rapid enough to cause the strong mixing by itself without dm burning . with @xmath51 ( see lower panel ) , however , the @xmath6 star lives about 10 times longer than in the corresponding non  dm burning case , and the star undergoes the quasi- chemically homogeneous evolution even with slow initial rotation because of the dm burning effect on nuclear burning time scale ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the star is thus gradually transformed into a massive helium star by the end of main sequence as almost all of the hydrogen atoms in the star are fused into heliums due to mixing .",
    "our results indicate that dm burning should not significantly alter our view on the final fate of the non  rotating first stars : pair  instability supernovae for @xmath52 , and core  collapse events for other masses @xcite , although their life times may be significantly prolonged",
    ". however , the impact of dm burning appears more important for rotating stars",
    ". the quasi - chemically homogeneous evolution can be rather easily realized even with moderate rotation velocities with @xmath53 \\la 10^{11}$ ] .",
    "such evolution can lead to production of massive helium stars that emit large amounts of helium ionizing photons , as well as abundant production of primary nitrogen , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "note also that the quasi - chemically homogeneous evolution scenario ( ches ) is one of the favored ones for the production of long grbs from metal poor stars  @xcite .",
    "our result therefore indicates that dm burning might promote the production of long gamma ",
    "ray bursts from the first stars of @xmath54 via the ches channel ( see * ? ? ?",
    "dm burning in the first stars must have consequences in the history of reionization in the early universe .",
    "table  1 lists the number of hydrogen and helium ionizing photons emitted from @xmath6 models .",
    "if @xmath55 , the total number of ionizing photons increases proportionally to the dm density , as a direct consequence of the life  prolonging effect of dm burning . for a given @xmath0 rotation does not significantly alter hydrogen ionizing photon counts nor the lifetime",
    "however , for models that take path of the ches , the helium ionizing photon counts is increased by more than a factor of 2 compared to the non  rotating case .",
    "if @xmath0 is very large , on the other hand , the surface temperature of the star drops significantly enough ( fig .",
    "1 ) that the total number of ionizing photons is reduced even with much longer lifetimes due to the dm burning . for example , with @xmath56 , it would have to take @xmath57 10 gyr to emit as many hydrogen ionizing photons as a non  dm burning counterpart . therefore ,",
    "if most of the first stars had been born with such high @xmath0 their contribution to reionization would have been dramatically reduced . the effect of the temperature drop on the number of helium ionizing photons is even more prominent : with @xmath58 , it decreases by more than 19 orders of magnitude compared to the other cases with lower @xmath0 .",
    "future study on the history of helium ionization at high redshift might therefore be a strong probe of dm burning in the first stars .",
    "in this study we assume that the background dm halo density stays constant throughout the stellar evolution .",
    "this assumption may be valid if the stellar life times are shorter than about 100 myr  which is the expected merger timescale of dm halos at at z @xmath57 20  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  as in our model sequences with @xmath59",
    ". the evolution of dm burners in halos with higher @xmath0 , however , should be critically determined by the change of dm halo environments .",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently reduced due to merger events and/or to displacement of the star from the densest region of the dm halo , the dm burners will become `` normal '' stars , dominated by nuclear burning .",
    "the star may then die quickly as we expect for normal stars , or become a `` born  again '' dm burner if @xmath0 increases again in later stages for some reason .",
    "the detailed history of the feedback from the first stars ( e.g. metal enrichment and reionization ) on the evolution of the early universe may depend on the nature and evolution of dm halos where the first stars are formed .",
    "this issue should be addressed in future work .",
