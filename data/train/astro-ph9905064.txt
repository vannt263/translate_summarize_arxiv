    "the existence of tight scaling relations between observable photometric and kinematic galaxy parameters , in particular the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies ( jrgensen et al .",
    "@xcite , scodeggio @xcite ) , and the tully - fisher relation for spirals ( tf , tully & fisher @xcite ) , finds its most straightforward application in the evaluation of galaxy distances .",
    "the small scatter observed in both relations implies a fine tuning between parameters strictly related to the stellar component alone , such as the optical luminosity , and the kinematic properties of the galaxy , which are affected by the overall mass distribution ( both dark and visible ) .    in the case of spiral galaxies , it is therefore suggestive that a tight scaling relation may also exist between photometric and kinematic properties _ of the disks alone _ , with a scatter as low as , or even lower , than the tf relation .",
    "karachentsev ( @xcite ) found that , for a sample of 15 edge - on galaxy , the disk scale length @xmath1 was connected to the 21  cm line velocity width @xmath2 and the @xmath3band central disk brightness @xmath4 by the relation @xmath5 , with a scatter in @xmath6 of 0.048 .",
    "the uncertainty implied in the distance is around 12% , smaller than the one usually achieved by the tf relation ( @xmath7% ) .",
    "more recently chiba & yoshii ( @xcite , cy95 hereafter ) tested on a sample of 14 nearby spirals the relation @xmath8 in the @xmath9 band , where @xmath10 is the galaxy rotation velocity measured at 2.2 disk scalelengths . since the contribution from the disk to the overall rotation curve ( rc ) has a maximum at this particular distance , the authors argue that the contributions from bulge and dark halo are likely to be less important , and therefore the measured velocity should represent a good estimate for the rotation of the disk alone . for a set of exponential disks of fixed mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath11 ) one would expect @xmath12 $ ] , corresponding to @xmath13 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : cy ] ) as a distance indicator is inferior to the one attained by the traditional tf relation by at least a factor of 2 .    besides beeing a tool to provide redshift - independent distances",

    "respect , spiral disks are a potentially `` easy '' class of systems , since they are all characterized by well defined shape and kinematics : if the effects of extinction on their surface brightness distribution are accounted for , and a reliable estimate of their mass is obtained , the subsequent scaling relations will be directly related to systematic variations in the disks stellar content .",

    "we investigate the existence and tightness of a general scaling relation in the near infrared ( nir ) , similar to the one defining the fp , for both structural components ( disks and bulges ) of a sample of 40 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "our aim is to test the power of these relations as tools to measure galaxy distances , and use them to provide new information about the stellar content and star formation history of spiral galaxies . in the present paper we are going to deal mainly with the problem of the distance measurements , leaving a thorough discussion of the second point to future work .",

    "the 40 spiral galaxies considered for this study are drawn from a larger sample selected in the pisces  perseus supercluster region , for which @xmath0 band images are available ( see moriondo et al . @xcite and @xcite for a thorough description of the original sample ) .",
    "this subset in particular contains the galaxies for which a rc is also available both from the literature or the private database of rg and mh , and includes morphological types ranging from sa to scd . in most cases ,",

    "most of the 14 galaxies , for which the disk contribution alone is sufficient to match the inner rc , are characterized by the smallest bulge  to  disk ratios ( @xmath19 ) of the sample ( @xmath20 ) , or by the faintest bulge luminosities ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that in these cases the bulge contribution to the overall rc can not be adequately resolved .",

    "the remaining `` low mass '' bulges are placed well below the sequence , out of the plot window , suggesting that their mass is largely underestimated . in the following analyisis , therefore , we will consider only the bulges plotted in fig .",

    "to derive an @xmath0-band tf relation for our galaxies the 21  cm line velocity widths from the rg and mh database ( table 3 ) have been corrected for instrumental smoothing , redshift , turbulence , and inclination of the galaxy to the line of sight , according to the prescriptions in giovanelli et al .",

    "the absolute galaxy magnitudes in the @xmath0 band ( table 2 ) are derived integrating the surface brightness profiles extrapolated up to 8 disk scalelengths ; a small correction to face - on aspect is applied , using the results obtained for the disks alone in moriondo et al .",

    "figure [ fig : tf ] shows the plot we obtain , with the best fit to the data after the exclusion of the three discrepant points to the right . in the case of ugc  12618 , our value for the inclination is probably underestimated , leading to an exceedingly large correction for @xmath2 ; on the other hand , due to its large errorbars , the contribution of this galaxy to the fit is not very significant anyway . in the case of ugc  1350 and ugc  2617 , the observed @xmath2 is likely to be overestimated , maybe for a misidentification of the galaxy ; we note that for these two objects an estimate of the rotation derived from the rc is , respectively , about 75% and 50% smaller than @xmath2 .",

    "we now fit separately to bulges and disks a relation @xmath31 involving a scalelength , a velocity , and a surface brightness , analogous to the fp of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the designated parameters for the bulges are the effective radius @xmath32 , the surface brightness at @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and a velocity defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bulge mass , in units of 10@xmath36 . since for all the bulges selected ( the ones with @xmath37 ) the brightness distribution is fitted by a pure exponential ",
    "i.e. they all have the same shape  this velocity scales as the rotation velocity , measured at 2.2 bulge scalelengths @xmath38 .",
    "also , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related by constant factors respectively to @xmath38 and the central surface brightness @xmath4 ( the two parameters usually adopted for the disks ) : @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . for the disks we choose the exponential scalelength @xmath1 , the central surface brightness @xmath4 , and a velocity @xmath41 defined via a relation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_b ] ) , with the disk mass and the disk scalelength .",
    "again , this velocity differs from the value at 2.2 @xmath1 by the same factor for all the exponential distributions .",
    "following cy95 , we also consider a relation involving @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and the _ total galaxy rotation velocity _ at 2.2 @xmath1 , derived directly from the rc , which we will indicate as @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out that the three parameters to be fitted have comparable uncertainties , and each point needs to be weighted by a combination of them . in the case of the structural parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath3 ) , besides the formal error from the fit to the brightness distributions , a major contribution is added from the errors in the corrections to face - on aspect , that is from the uncertainty in the amount of internal extinction .",
    "these are evaluated according to the results in moriondo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the velocity depends in principle on the errors associated both to the rc measurement and to the scale length .",
    "however we expect this latter contribution to be less important , especially for the disks , whose scalelength is always the best determined parameter in the surface brightness decompositions .",
    "therefore we assume the uncertainty on the velocities to be well represented by the formal error derived from the fitting routine .",
    "the errors on all other quantities are derived from these values : for example , the error on the disk mass is obtained combining the uncertainties on the velocity and the scale length , since @xmath43 .",
    "the fit to the disk parameters yields @xmath44 where `` @xmath45 '' designates the average over the sample .",
    "if @xmath10 is chosen , instead of the value defined in terms of the disk mass and scalelength , we obtain @xmath46 we note that these coefficients are close to the values implied by the tf relation derived in sect .",
    "[ sec : tf ] : in fact , from @xmath47 , we derive @xmath48 . therefore , the tf relation is a nearly edge - on projection of the fp .",
    "also , these values are not inconsistent with the constraint implicit in the relation suggested by cy95 ( eq .",

    "the best fit to the bulge parameters yields : @xmath50 again , a relation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : cy ] ) is not ruled out , even if with a slope @xmath51 slighlty different from the disks value .",
    "the errors associated to the various coefficients are estimated by performing a large number of monte carlo simulations of the data sample and fitting each simulation , to derive a distribution of values for each coefficient .",
    "figures [ fig : fpd ] and [ fig : fpd2 ] show the relations we find for the disks , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : fpb ] shows the one for the bulges .",
    "the coefficients we derive for the disks are different from the values found by cy95 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , but closer to the ones reported by karachentsev ( @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; we note however that , in the case of cy95 , the photometric data were in a very different passband ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "both our coefficients and the other quoted values are not consistent with what would be expected on the basis of the virial theorem and a universal mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath13 and @xmath56 ) .    the various sets of coefficients can also be compared to the ones which define the fp of elliptical galaxies , evaluated using the central velocity dispersion as the kinematic parameter , and the effective surface brightness .",
    "for example , bender et al . ( @xcite ) report for the virgo cluster @xmath54 and @xmath57 , in the @xmath9 band ; more recently jrgensen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the gunn @xmath60 band , with a scatter of 0.084 in @xmath61 ; pahre et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate the nir coefficients of the plane to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the various fp s are not very different , and actually the existence of a `` cosmic metaplane '' has already been claimed by bender et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and bbfn .",
    "in particular they defined a set of three parameters ( the @xmath64 parameters ) particularly suited to represent the fp of elliptical galaxies in the @xmath9 band , and found that basically all the self  gravitating systems show a similar behaviour in the @xmath64-parameter space . in the case of spiral galaxies",
    ", they considered their global properties , without attempting a decomposition into structural components , and for the bulges in their data sample they used the central velocity dispersion as the kinematical parameter .",
    "this work improves the approach by characterizing separately bulges and disks from the photometric point of view ; in addition , we are able to determine the bulge mass independently of its kinematical status ( i.e. , if it s more or less supported by rotation ) , and obtain an independent estimate of the coefficients of the bulge fp .    figure [ fig : ksp ] shows our data in the @xmath65band @xmath64space , with bulges denoted as open circles , and disks as triangles .",
    "we have defined the three coordinates as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total mass in units of @xmath70 , @xmath11 is the stellar mass  to  ligth ratio in solar units , and @xmath33 is the effective surface brightness in @xmath71 . these definitions , besides being applied to a different passband , are slightly different from the ones introduced by bender et al .",
    ". we can calculate the transformations between the two sets of coordinates from the relations reported in the appendix a to bbfn , and assuming that all our bulges and disks are adequately described by exponentials . using a typical @xmath72 for both components ,",
    "we find    @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the @xmath77band bbfn parameters .",
    "the dotted line in the upper right corner of the @xmath78 vs. @xmath79 plot corresponds , in our set of coordinates , to the boundary of the so  called zone of exclusion ( zoe ) , defined in the @xmath9 band by @xmath80 : it is consistent with our data , in the sense that most bulges and all the disks are placed to its left side .",
    "the bbfn database for the bulges is here extended to lower masses , with several data ",
    "points falling in the typical range of dwarf ellipticals ( @xmath81 ) ; the two classes of objects appear however separated , with the bulges shifted towards higher values of @xmath79 , and therefore higher concentrations ( note that , for a given mass , @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath82 , which is higher for compact , bright objects ) .    for what concerns spiral galaxies , bbfn find that their average distance from the zoe increases steadily with morphological type , from sa s to irregulars ; the data points of our disks , however , are all placed in about the same region of the @xmath78@xmath79 plane , quite distant from the zoe , and roughly coincident with the locus occupied by scd s galaxies in the bbfn s plots .",
    "most likely , this difference arises from the separation of the two structural components , which has allowed us to plot the @xmath64 parameters of the _ disks alone _ :",
    "if the values for the whole galaxies are considered , one would expect the systems with higher @xmath19 ( namely , the early  type spirals ) to lie closer to the zoe , due to the contamination of the bulge .",
    "the bbfn sequence , therefore , would be mainly driven by the average @xmath19 , which in turn is roughly correlated with morphological type . when considered separately ,",
    "on the other hand , disks and bulges are located in two distinct , contiguous regions of the @xmath83space , as it is also evident from the @xmath79@xmath84 projection , with the disks shifted towards higher masses and lower concentrations .",
    "a different zoe could in principle be defined for the disks , with about the same slope but shifted by about two decades towards lower @xmath79 values .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ksp ] , we have plotted the slope of the @xmath77band fp for the virgo cluster , scaled to the centroid of the bulges ( dashed line ) and of the disks ( solid line ) .",
    "it appears to be consistent with our data , as suggested by the similarity of our coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpd ] ) and ( [ eq : fpd2 ] ) to the ones reported by bender et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "also , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) and the definition in bbfn , we can estimate the quantity @xmath85 for bulges and disks , representing their average vertical distance from the ellipticals fp in the @xmath74@xmath76 projection . in the case of the bulges , we find @xmath86 dex , in fair agreement with the bbfn estimate ( -0.03 ) ; for the disks we find a shift of -0.19 dex , which is about the value found by bbfn for spirals from type sa to sc .",
    "in order to assess the goodness of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpd ] ) and ( [ eq : fpd2 ] ) as tools to measure galaxy distances , we compare the scatter of the data points , with respect to the best fit , to the scatter associated to the tf relation .",
    "the dispersion is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the residual on the i - th data point and @xmath89 the associated weight , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wei ] ) .",
    "we find a dispersion of 0.38 mag for the tf relation , implying an uncertainty of 19% on the distance of a single galaxy .",
    "we note that the galaxy distances used in this context have been estimated purely from redshifts .",
    "the peculiar velocity field thus adds scatter to the corresponding tf relation in a measure which we estimate on the order of 0.15 to 0.20 mag , at the typical distance of these objects .",
    "had peculiar velocity  corrected distances been used , the tf scatter would have been so that distance estimates would have uncertainties of about 16% , rather then 19% .    in the case of the fp",
    ", we find a dispersion of 0.11 in @xmath90 if we use velocities derived from the best fits ( eq . ( [ eq : fpd ] ) ) , and of 0.09 if the velocities are the actual rotation velocities ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpd2 ] ) ) .",
    "the associated uncertainties in the distance are respectively about 29% and 23% . even if these two values are less than 1/2 of the dispersion quoted by giovanelli for the relation proposed by cy95 and a sample of 153 spiral galaxies ( 0.25 in @xmath90 , not based on a detailed disk  bulge decomposition analysis as we use here ) , they are still larger than the uncertainty yielded by the tf relation for our sample .",
    "therefore , according to our data , the disk fp is not as accurate , as a distance indicator , as the tf relation , even if it allows for one more free parameter in the relation .",
    "this result could be imputed to the scatter added to the relation by the uncertainties introduced in the data analysis process ( in particular , the decomposition of the surface brightness distribution and the fit to the rc ) .",
    "on the other hand , we find that a modified tully - fisher relation , in which the velocity width is replaced by @xmath10 , is characterized as well by a larger dispersion of 0.45 mag .",
    "this value is equivalent to the dispersion of 0.09 in @xmath90 associated to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpd2 ] ) . in a similar way ,",
    "if the total luminosity is replaced by the luminosity within 2.2 @xmath1 s , we find a very large dispersion of 0.64 mag .",
    "since these alternative parameters are not strictly derived from the surface brightness decompositions or by the fit to the rc s , as it is the case for the fp ones , we argue that using parameters associated with the inner part of the galaxy ( rather than global quantities ) , is in itself a major source of scatter in the scaling relation considered .",
    "thus , the fine tuning between photometric and kinematic parameters that yield the tf relation would be more effective because of their global character . about the much reduced dispersion with respect to the giovanelli data",
    ", we attribute this difference to the use of a more refined data - analysis technique for our sample .",
    "eqs .  ( [ eq : fpd])([eq : fpb ] ) show that for both disks and bulges a systematic variation of @xmath11 exists , if we assume that we have properly evaluated their shape , photometric properties ( including the effect of internal extinction ) , and contribution to the rc .",
    "in particular we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpd ] ) and ( [ eq : fpb ] ) as @xmath91 and @xmath92 whereas for elliptical galaxies the @xmath93 plane shows an edge - on view of the fp , this is not the case for disks and bulges , and a residual dependence on the scalelength is left ; this dependence is such that , if a given mass settles into a larger size , the corresponding @xmath11 ratio is larger . actually , this result is already implicit in the work by cy95 : a good match to equation [ eq : cy ] with @xmath94 is possible only if @xmath11 is a function of @xmath1 alone .",
    "previous results , both observational ( persic et al . 1996 ) , and theoretical ( navarro et al",
    ". @xcite , navarro @xcite ) , have suggested that the stellar @xmath11 in the @xmath9 band increases with the galaxy luminosity , rather than with its size .",
    "this conclusion is probably consistent with ours , since the total galaxy luminosity , especially in the @xmath9 band , is mainly determined by the disk scalelength . since the average stellar @xmath11 ratios are determined by the star ",
    "formation history of the galaxy , a connection must necessarily exist between the structural properties of the system , in particular its size , and the characteristics of its average stellar population .",
    "this is not surprising , since connections of this kind also exist for ellipitical galaxies : for example the one at the base of the well  known color  magnitude relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters which characterize stellar populations ( age , metallicity , star  formation rate , etc . ) , whose systematic variation could be responsible of the observed trend , are far too many to be constrained by our @xmath65band data alone . some additional information on this issue could be provided by a detailed multiband analysis  possibly integrated by spectroscopic data  as the one recently carried out by pahre et al .",

    "of course , any intermediate scenario between the two extremes discussed here ( `` maximum disk '' solutions and constant stellar @xmath11 ) could be considered as well . from the observational point of view , again , more detailed spectrophotometric data might better constrain possible variations in the average stellar population of different galaxies , and help to distinguish between the different possibilities .",
    "using near  infrared images and rotation curves of a sample of 40 spiral galaxies , we have determined the scaling relations , between structural and kinematic parameters of bulges and disks , analogous to the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies .",

    "<S> it is speculated that the difference is due to the more robust character of global parameters , rather than those associated with the inner parts of disks . </S>",
    "<S> it also apperas that ( a ) either the stellar mass - to - light ratios of bulge and disk increase with the size of the components , or ( b ) the bulge and disk relative contributions to the overall rotation of the galaxy ( and , as a consequence , to its total mass ) become steadily smaller with increasing size . </S>"
