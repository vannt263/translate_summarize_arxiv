    "the search for dark matter is currently one of the most active fields of research in experimental astroparticle physics .",
    "common candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , with only weak and gravitational interactions with normal matter , and which encompass a variety of particle types in the mass range from a few tens of gev to a few hundred tev , where the upper limit is based on theoretical arguments to preserve unitarity  @xcite . among wimp candidates",
    "are the lightest neutralino arising in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , or the lightest kaluza - klein mode in models of universal extra dimensions ( ued )  @xcite .",
    "these candidates are thermal relics from the big bang , and since they are stable , assumed to be able to contribute to the dark matter content in the halos of galaxies .    in a different scenario",
    ", it has been shown that super - massive particles can be produced in the early universe and account for dark matter , independently of their interaction strength with normal matter . in order to avoid the mass limit imposed by unitarity constraints",
    ", one can model non  thermal production of super - massive particles  @xcite .",
    "the large mass will prevent the particle to ever get into thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma .",
    "super - massive dark matter candidates were coined wimpzillas  @xcite if assumed to interact weakly with matter and simpzillas  @xcite if the interaction is strong . the production mechanism discussed in  @xcite favours particles with masses of the order of the inflaton mass ( @xmath310@xmath4  gev ) , but particles of masses as low as a few hundred gev",
    "can also be produced , normally denoted as strongly interacting massive particles ( simps ) .",
    "although simps are in general taken to be in the mass range @xmath310@xmath5 m@xmath610@xmath7 gev , and simpzillas , with masses m@xmath810@xmath7 gev , we will generically call them either simpzillas .    searches for simpzillas have been carried out in a variety of ways in the past .",
    "figure  [ fig : pexc ] shows the current exclusion region in the mass versus simpzilla  nucleon cross section parameter space .",
    "the `` mine / space '' region ( blue square hatched ) was ruled out by many different experiments underground or space - borne  @xcite  .",
    "more recently , a search for simpzillas using results from direct detection experiments excluded most of the remaining parameter space for high masses ( solid yellow , labeled `` direct '' )  @xcite . a recent analysis further constrained the allowed region by using the earth heat flow to set constrains on the annihilation of captured dark matter in the earth s center ( green striped , labelled `` earth heat '' )  @xcite .",
    "the blank triangular regions in figure  [ fig : pexc ] remained unprobed until this work .    whether thermally produced or not , stable dark matter candidates can gravitationally accumulate as a halo in our galaxy , becoming bound in orbits in the solar system .",
    "further energy losses can occur in elastic interactions with matter in large celestial bodies , like the sun .",
    "if they lose enough energy they can fall below the escape velocity of the object , accumulating in its center and annihilating therein  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos of energies _ o_(100 gev ) can be produced from the decays of the annihilation products .",
    "this allows for an indirect search for dark matter with neutrino telescopes , based on a search for an excess neutrino flux from the direction of the sun over the known atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "predictions of simpzilla event rates and neutrino telescopes sensitivity have been anticipated in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the capabilities of icecube to detect high - energy neutrinos from simpzilla annihilations in the sun .",
    "the baseline icecube geometry consists of 80 strings with 60 digital optical modules each , instrumenting 1 km@xmath9 of ice at depths between 1450  m2450  m near the geographic south pole  @xcite .",
    "recently , an addition of six strings forming a denser core in the middle of the icecube array has been proposed in order to lower the neutrino energy threshold of the detector to about 10  gev , the so  called `` deepcore '' array  @xcite .",
    "although the icecube geometry has been optimized to detect ultra - high energy ( @xmath10tev ) neutrinos from potential cosmic sources with sub - degree angular resolution , its angular response is still adequate at _ o_(100 gev ) to perform directional searches for dark matter .",
    "icecube has recently published results on the searches for wimps arising in the mssm  @xcite or the simplest ued model  @xcite using 22 strings deployed in the 2006/2007 antarctic season . in this work",
    "we use this 22-string detector ( hereafter referred to as icecube-22 ) which took data during the 2007 austral winter .",
    "we set a limit in the simpzilla mass , m@xmath11 , versus simpzilla - nucleon cross section , @xmath12 , phase space using the fact that icecube-22 has not detected any neutrino excess from the direction of the sun .",
    "we also estimate the sensitivity of the full icecube detector in its expected final configuration with 86 strings ( hereafter referred to as icecube-86 ) .",
    "in order to estimate the neutrino rate from simpzilla annihilations in the sun , we use the capture rate , as well as the full - flavour neutrino flux and energy spectrum at the core of the sun as determined in  @xcite .",
    "we then simulate the neutrino propagation to the earth , including energy losses and oscillation effects .",
    "the capture rate , @xmath13 , depends on the mass of the simpzilla , m@xmath11 , and the strength of the interaction of simpzillas with nucleons , @xmath12 .",
    "the capture efficiency can be described by the parameter @xmath14 , where m@xmath15 is the average nucleon mass , n@xmath15 is the number density of nucleons in the sun and r@xmath16 is the radius of the sun . for large cross sections , q",
    "@xmath17 1 , and simpzillas lose enough energy in their passage through the sun to be efficiently captured .",
    "the capture rate ( in s@xmath18 ) is then given by @xmath19    on the other hand , if q@xmath101 , capture is determined by the relative velocity , and only low velocity simpzillas are trapped .",
    "in such case , the capture rate is @xmath20\\left(\\frac{10^{12}\\ , \\text{gev}}{m_\\text{\\tiny x}}\\right)\\,\\times \\\\   & \\times \\left ( \\frac{\\text{u}_{th}}{240\\ , \\text{km}\\ , \\text{s}^{-1}}\\right ) \\,\\left ( \\frac{r_\\odot}{7\\times 10^{10 } \\text{cm}}\\right)^2 \\\\ \\end{split } \\label{eq : gamma2_c}\\ ] ]    where in the above expressions @xmath21 and u@xmath22 is the speed of the sun in the galaxy and @xmath23 is the sun escape velocity . note that if @xmath12 goes to zero , then the capture rate goes to zero through its dependency on @xmath24 , as it is expected .",
    "the simpzilla capture rate is large enough to reach equilibrium with the annihilation rate , @xmath25 , in the lifetime of the solar system , and therefore we can assume  @xmath26 . +    the neutrino spectrum from simpzilla annihilations is modeled as producing a pair of quarks or gluons , which will fragment into high multiplicity hadronic jets .",
    "long - lived light and charmed hadrons will lose energy through interactions in the dense solar interior before decaying , producing low energy neutrinos .",
    "on the other hand , due to its short lifetime , @xmath27 s , the top quark will not have time to hadronize or lose energy through interaction in the medium before decaying into w@xmath28 .",
    "the w then decays into @xmath29 , with similar probability into each flavour @xmath30 .",
    "annihilations into top quarks is therefore a promising channel to produce high energetic neutrinos detectable by neutrino telescopes .",
    "bottom quarks are also a potential source of high energy neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "however in this work we only consider neutrinos produced from the top decay chain , which makes our results conservative .",
    "note that although the initially available energy for each top is very high ( the mass m@xmath31 of the simpzilla ) , the available phase space is shared among many produced particles ( 2.8@xmath3210@xmath33 tops are produced per annihilation  @xcite , where @xmath34 is the mass of the simpzilla in units of 10@xmath4  gev ) , so the average energy per produced particle is of _ o _ ( tev ) .",
    "the main consequence of this is that initial - state gluon radiation can be neglected , not playing an important role in further degrading the energy of the tops before they decay .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : e_t ] , which shows the energy distribution of the tops at the production point ( dashed line ) and just before decaying ( full line ) , obtained with a full ` pythia `  @xcite simulation .    taking into account the above considerations",
    ", the energy distribution of the neutrinos produced from top decays at the center of the sun can be parametrized as    @xmath35[(e_{\\nu}+\\text{m}_{\\mbox{\\tiny w}})^2-\\text{m}_{\\mbox{\\tiny w}}^2]}}\\\\ \\label{eq : parametrization}\\ ] ]    where m@xmath36 and m@xmath37 are the w boson and top quark masses respectively , and we have omitted a constant normalization factor .",
    "the energy dependence of the neutrino flux at the detector ( earth ) will be modified by neutrino energy losses in their way out of the sun and by oscillations . in order to include these effects we use the publicly available wimpsim code  @xcite , which we have modified so it takes the neutrino spectrum from equation  ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) .",
    "we use as input the three flavours with their correct relative intensity from the top decay chain . figure  [ fig : nuflux ] shows the injection spectrum of muon neutrinos at the sun from simpzilla annihilations according to equation  ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) ( dashed line ) , and the resulting spectrum at the earth ( full line ) .",
    "the injection spectrum has been truncated at 10 tev for display purposes .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the initial energy available in the annihilation is shared among an enormous amount of annihilation products and , furthermore , the energy of the resulting neutrinos is further reduced by energy losses in the sun .",
    "the spectrum at the detector is therefore not very different from those of lighter dark matter candidates , like mssm neutralinos or kaluza - klein modes .",
    "this allows us to use icecube-22 background determination found in both wimp and kaluza - klein dark matter analysis @xcite .",
    "since icecube is mainly sensitive to muon neutrinos through the detection of muon tracks , we only use the muon - neutrino flux at the detector for our calculations in what follows .",
    "the number of signal events , n@xmath38 , from simpzilla annihilations in the sun predicted in a neutrino telescope of effective area a@xmath39 during an exposure time t , is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the muon neutrino flux at the detector , @xmath42 is the number of tops per annihilation , @xmath43 is the branching ratio of w decaying into neutrinos ( 0.326 ) and @xmath25 is the annihilation rate in the center of the sun . the effective area is a measure of the efficiency of the detector and includes the neutrino - nucleon interaction probability , the energy loss of the produced muon from the interaction point to the detector and the detector trigger and analysis efficiency .    in order to compare our expected signal with icecube-22 observations",
    ", we use the neutrino effective area of icecube-22 published in  @xcite , and shown in figure  [ fig : icecube_aeff ] . in 104.3 days of live time icecube-22",
    "has detected 13 events from the direction of the sun , while the expected number of atmospheric neutrinos is 18.5  @xcite .",
    "the expected signal strength for the given live time is shown in figure  [ fig : evr ] . we have assumed a 15% uncertainty in the expectation of the atmospheric neutrino flux at the relevant energies ( e@xmath4450 gev ) in order to calculate the 90% cl upper limit on a possible signal , @xmath45 , following the prescription in  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 = 3.1 . a scan in the ( m@xmath11 , @xmath12 ) parameter space , selecting models that predict less events than @xmath45 leads to the 90% cl exclusion region shown in figure  [ fig : exclusion ] ( read cross  hatched area ) .",
    "the results disfavour a large region of the parameter space , and we discuss their significance in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the completed icecube detector can be estimated from the expected number of background events ( due to atmospheric neutrinos ) and the detector effective area .",
    "an estimation of the expected effective area of icecube-86 at trigger level has been given in  @xcite .",
    "previous analyses of icecube and amanda show that the effective area is reduced between a factor of 5 to 10 between trigger level and the final analysis level , due to the cuts that are applied to clean the data sets and select high quality tracks .",
    "we have taken a conservative approach here and we have reduced the trigger effective area given in  @xcite by a factor between 15 for low energies down to 5 at the higher energies , and used that as our estimate of where the effective area of icecube-86 at a final analysis level might be .",
    "the curve used is shown as the upper curve in figure  [ fig : icecube_aeff ] .",
    "we have calculated the number of atmospheric neutrino events in icecube using the measured atmospheric neutrino flux by amanda  @xcite .",
    "we parametrized the curve in figure  10 in  @xcite as dn@xmath46/ded@xmath47 = a e@xmath48 gev@xmath18 @xmath49 s@xmath18 sr@xmath18 , with a=0.11407 and @xmath50 = 3.142 .",
    "the expected number of atmospheric neutrino events in icecube-86 from the direction of the sun in a exposure time t is then given by @xmath51 , where the angular integration is performed over the 0.5@xmath52 that the sun subtends in the sky .",
    "we have assumed no contamination of misreconstructed atmospheric muons in the final sample , and therefore we use only the 3.4 atmospheric neutrino events from the direction of the sun predicted by the integral above in 365 days live time . as in the previous section ,",
    "we have used a 15% uncertainty on the overall normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux , as also indicated by the amanda measurement , and calculated the sensitivity including this uncertainty .",
    "the 90% cl exclusion region from icecube-86 is shown in figure  [ fig : exclusion ] as the black line .",
    "it agrees well with the predictions made in  @xcite .",
    "we have used recently published results from the 22-string icecube detector on wimp dark matter searches  @xcite to extend the search to strongly interacting dark matter candidates in the mass range @xmath310@xmath5 m@xmath610@xmath2 gev .",
    "the fact that the icecube results are compatible with the expected atmospheric neutrino background allows us to set restrictive limits on the mass versus nucleon cross section parameter space .",
    "a note on the complementarity of direct and indirect searches is due at this point .",
    "generally , the total cross section with nucleons , @xmath12 , can have at least two contributions , a spin - independent ( or scalar ) component and a spin - dependent ( or axial - vector ) component , the relative strength of each depending on the exact assumptions made on the structure and interaction of the simpzilla .",
    "there is no detailed modelling in the literature of the way that simpzillas interact with matter , other than the interaction is assumed to be `` strong '' , as opposed to weak as in the case of wimps .",
    "however for experimental searches such distinction is important because different experiments probe different components of the cross section .",
    "the results from the experiments shown in figure  [ fig : pexc ] refer mainly to the spin - independent component of the simpzilla - nucleon cross section , due to the nature of the targets involved or , in the case of the earth heat flow analysis , due to the fact that the capture of dark matter candidates in the earth proceeds mainly through scattering on spinless nuclei ( fe , si , o , mg ) . on the other hand",
    "the icecube results are sensitive to the spin - dependent cross section since the sun is the target for capture , which is essentially a proton target .    in view of the previous considerations ,",
    "the current results from icecube provide the most restrictive limits so far on the spin - dependent cross section of simpzillas .",
    "the fact that they overlap in the ( m@xmath11 , @xmath12 ) parameter space with previous exclusion regions from experiments which probe mainly the spin - independent cross section , practically rules out simpzillas as dark matter .",
    "it would require an unreasonably narrow fine tuning of the mass and the structure of the cross section to propose a viable candidate that would evade all the current limits .    in conclusion , strongly interacting heavy relics from the early universe can only account for the dark matter if they have masses above @xmath53  gev .",
    "as these ultra heavy masses are not currently favored by any model , the window for simpzillas as the only component of dark matter can be considered closed .",
