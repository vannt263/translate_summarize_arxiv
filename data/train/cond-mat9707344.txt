    "considerable interests have been generated recently in understanding the statistics of first passage events in spatially extended nonequilibrium systems .",
    "these systems include the ising or potts model undergoing zero temperature phase ordering dynamics@xcite , simple diffusion equation with random initial conditions@xcite , several reaction - diffusion systems@xcite and fluctuating interfaces either in the steady states or approaching steady states starting from random initial configurations@xcite .",
    "typically one is interested in persistence , i.e. , the probability @xmath5 that at a fixed point in space , the quantity @xmath6 $ ] ( where @xmath7 is a fluctuating field e.g. , the spin field in the ising model or the height of a fluctuating interface ) does not change upto time @xmath1 . in all the examples mentioned above , this probability decays as a power law , @xmath8 , where the exponent @xmath9 is nontrivial .",
    "this nontriviality is due to the fact that the effective stochastic process in time at a fixed point in space becomes non - markovian due to the coupling to the neighbours . for a non - markovian process , calculation of any history dependent quantity such as persistence",
    "is extremely hard barring a few special cases@xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 has also been measured in a recent experiment on a liquid crystal system which has the same dynamics as the @xmath10 ising model in @xmath11-d@xcite .",
    "the experimental value was in good agreement with the analytical prediction of @xmath9 in @xmath11-d ising model@xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 has also been measured in a recent experiment on two dimensional soap froth@xcite .    in the above",
    ", one studied the persistence of a _ single _ spin ( e.g. , in the ising or potts model ) of the initial random configuration .",
    "a natural generalization of this would be to study the persistence of a _ pattern _ , and not just a single spin , present in the initial configuration .",
    "persistent patterns are quite abundant in nature .",
    "examples include persistent eddies and vortices in turbulence , the great red spot of jupiter or certain patterns of stock prices in financial markets .",
    "another example is the so called activity - centered pattern in a self - organized system such as an interface in a random medium@xcite and also in certain models of evolution@xcite .",
    "a natural question then is : what is the probability that a given pattern survives upto time @xmath1 ?",
    "such persistent patterns exist also in phase ordering systems such as the @xmath2-state potts model .",
    "for example , one such pattern is an original domain of a specific colour present in the random initial configuration of the potts model .",
    "one can then ask : what is the survival probability of such a domain upto time @xmath1 ? this quantity for the @xmath12-d potts model has recently been studied by krapivsky and ben - naim@xcite .",
    "however this can be a more general question for any fluctuating field such as the solution of diffusion equation with random initial configuration or a fluctuating interface approaching the steady state .",
    "in such examples , a domain would be a connected set of points where the sign of the fluctuating field is positive ( or negative ) .",
    "another example of  pattern \" persistence would be to study the probability that two adjacent domains in the initial configuration both survive upto time @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we develop a general framework to study the persistence of patterns of a fluctuting field and discuss a few examples in detail where explicit results can be obtained .    the general framework to study",
    "some of these  pattern \" persistence problems consists of monitoring the motion of an external test particle launched in the fluctuating field .",
    "the dynamics of the test particle is suitably chosen so that the particle evaluates where the specific pattern of the fluctuating field is and moves there .",
    "the persistence of the pattern is then precisely the survival probability of the test particle .",
    "this led us naturally to study a more general  persistence of a mobile particle ( p ) in a field ( f ) \" problem ( henceforth the pf problem ) , special cases of which correspond to the  pattern \" persistence in the underlying field . in this paper",
    "we study in detail a few examples of this general pf problem and find very rich , though often nonuniversal , behaviour .",
    "the general pf problem can be defined as follows .",
    "let us consider a field @xmath7 that fluctuates in both space and time .",
    "for example , the field @xmath7 may be the solution of the simple diffusion equation @xmath13 , or the order parameter profile of the ising model undergoing @xmath10 coarsening dynamics or the height profile of a fluctuating interface or may even be spatially uncorrelated brownian signal @xmath14 where @xmath15 is spatially and temporally uncorrelated gaussian white noise .",
    "a test particle is launched at an arbitrary initial point at time @xmath16 . the particle moves according to some prescribed deterministic or stochastic rules which in general depend on the local field profile .",
    "we now ask the question : given the dynamics of the particle , what is the probability @xmath0 that the field seen by the particle at its own location does not change sign upto time @xmath1 ?",
    "the survival probability of a mobile particle in a field has been studied before in the context of heterogeneous reaction - diffusion systems@xcite where the test particle was an external impurity diffusing through a homogeneous background .",
    "these studies dealt with a special case of our general pf problem , namely when the test particle is a simple random walker and the field is the coarsening  colour \" field of the @xmath2-state potts model at @xmath10@xcite . amongst other studies on the similar line was the computation of the trapping time distribution of a diffusing tracer particle on a solid - on - solid surface@xcite . in this paper , we extend these studies to several other examples arising naturally in the context of our general pf problem .    in the pf problem",
    ", one needs to specify the dynamics of the field as well as that of the test particle . for the field",
    ", we will consider three different cases , namely when the fields are : ( i ) the solution of diffusion equation ,",
    "( ii ) the spin profile of the ising model or in general the  colour \" profile of the @xmath2-state potts model undergoing @xmath10 coarsening dynamics and ( iii ) spatially uncorrelated brownian signals .",
    "the motion of the test particle , in general , consists of two separate moves .",
    "in the first part of the motion the particle sees the local field profile and then adopts a strategy to move in such a way so that it can live longer . this is the  adaptive \" part of the motion that depends on the local field profile .",
    "in addition to this  adaptive \" move the particle in general may be subjected to an external noise which consitutes the second part of the motion .",
    "this  noisy \" part consists of brownian moves of the particle that is independent of the local field profile .",
    "while the motion consisting of both  adaptive \" and  noisy \" moves is more general , for the sake of simplicity we will restrict ourselves to two separate cases when the motion is either purely  adaptive \" or purely  noisy \" .",
    "in the first case , the survival probability is larger than the  static \" case ( when the particle is at rest ) and in the second case , it is smaller . in cases where survival probabilities both in the mobile and the static cases decay as power laws , the exponent inequality @xmath17 holds where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the persistence exponents associated with the  adaptive \" and the  random walk \" motion of the test particle .",
    "the relationship between the survival probability of the test particle and the persistence of  patterns \" in the underlying field is established wherever possible . in all these studies",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to one dimension although in most cases the generalizations to higher dimensions is quite straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section-1",
    ", we consider the  adaptive \" motion of the test particle .",
    "three cases of the fields are considered . by suitably choosing the adaptive strategy ,",
    "the survival probability of the particle is related to that of a  pattern \" ( original domain in the potts model or diffusion equation ) .",
    "an exact solution is presented for the special case when the motion of the  adaptive \" particle is  directed \" and the field is spatially uncorrelated brownian signals . in section-2 , we consider the  noisy \" motion of the test particle where it performs simple  random walk \" .",
    "approximate analytical methods are developed to calculate the exponent characeterizing the power law decay of the survival probability of the particle . in section-3 , a special case of the survival of the the diffusive test particle in the @xmath12-d potts model",
    "is shown to be related to the persistence of an initial pattern , namely two adjacent original domains .",
    "this is also related to the fraction of _ uncollided _ domain walls at time @xmath1 in the @xmath12-d potts model which we study both by numerical and analytical methods .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary , some suggestions for future directions and possible experimental realizations or tests of our results .",
    "some details about a variational calculation are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section we consider the adaptive motion of the test particle in which the particle adopts a strategy to move in a way such that it can live longer .",
    "the model and the strategy is as follows .",
    "consider a lattice with periodic boundary conditions for convenience .",
    "the field @xmath20 evolves with time according to some prescribed dynamics .",
    "a test particle is launched at @xmath16 , at an arbitrary site say the origin .",
    "let us assume that at @xmath16 , the sign of the field @xmath21 at the origin is positive ( or negative ) . as time changes , the field @xmath20 changes .",
    "as long as the sign of the field at the origin is positive ( or negative ) , the particle does not move .",
    "when the sign changes at the origin , the particle looks for a nearest neighbour where the field is positive ( or negative ) .",
    "if it finds such a neighbour it goes there . in case",
    "there are more than one neighbours with positive ( or negative ) fields , it chooses one of them at random .",
    "then it waits there till the sign of @xmath21 at the new site changes and then again it moves to one of its current neighbours and so on . if at some stage , the sign changes at the particle s current site and it fails to find a neighbour with positive ( or negative ) field , then it dies .",
    "then we ask : what is the probability @xmath22 that the particle survives upto time @xmath1 .",
    "note that if the particle did not move at all and stayed put at one site only , then the survival probability @xmath5 is the usual  static persistence \" .",
    "we first consider the case when the field @xmath23 is the solution of the simple diffusion equation @xmath24 , starting from a random initial configuration of @xmath21 .",
    "for this simple field , analytical computation of even the static persistence @xmath5 turned out to be quite nontrivial@xcite . in @xmath12-d , it was found that @xmath8 for large @xmath1 where @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the reason for the nontriviality once again can be traced to the fact that the effective gaussian process that a static particle sees in time is non - markovian .",
    "nevertheless , an  independent interval approximation \" ( iia ) was developed in@xcite , which produced analytical predictions for @xmath9 for all dimensions that were extremely accurate .    in case of the moving particle with the adaptive strategy",
    ", we carried out a numerical simulation .",
    "the results are presented in fig . [ 1 ] .",
    "we find , @xmath26 for large @xmath1 , where @xmath27 , compared to @xmath28 .",
    "thus the strategy adapted by the particle is  successful \" in the sense that the exponent , and not just the amplitude , characterizing the decay of persistence decreases .",
    "thus in the renormalization group language , the adaptive strategy is a relevant perturbation .",
    "it is clear from above that the strategy that the particle adopts is basically to move towards the local maximum ( or minimum ) of the underlying field if the initial sign of the field that the particle sees is positive ( or negative ) . by symmetry of the initial condition the survival probability of the particle",
    "does not depend on the initial sign of the field that it sees . hence without any loss of generality it is sufficient to consider the case when the particle moves only towards local maximum .",
    "this observation may be used to develop a possible continuum approach to this problem .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the position of the particle measured from a fixed point in space and @xmath30 denote the co - ordinate of an arbitrary point in space measured from the location of the particle .",
    "then , the effective field @xmath31 as seen by the particle is given by , @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath33 denotes the position of the particle .",
    "given that @xmath21 satisfies diffusion equation , the equation of motion of @xmath31 is given by , @xmath34 .",
    "we now model the adaptive strategy ( namely that the particle tries to move towards the local maximum ) by assuming that the velocity of the particle is proportional to the local slope of the field that the particle sees , i.e. , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "the implication of this assumption is clear .",
    "if the local slope is positive , the particle moves to the right and if the local slope is negative , the particle moves to the left .",
    "thus the particle always tries to move towards the local maximum .",
    "so , the equation satisfied by @xmath31 is @xmath38 which is a non - local and nonlinear kpz type of equation .",
    "then the adaptive persistence in this formulation is the probability that the local field @xmath39 does not change sign upto time @xmath1 . while a continuum formulation does not make it easier to compute the adaptive persistence exponent , but it relates the problem to the more familiar problem of persistence of fluctuating interfaces@xcite .",
    "however we will not study this equation any further in the present paper and will defer its discussion for future@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case when the field is the",
    " colour \" field of the @xmath2-state potts model undergoing @xmath10 temperature dynamics .",
    "at each site of a lattice , the field can take @xmath2 possible colours .",
    "one starts from a random initial configuration of colours .",
    "a site is chosen at random and its colour is changed to one of its neighbours .",
    "this is how the colour field evolves .",
    "a test particle is launched as usual and it waits at its initial site till the colour of that site changes .",
    "then it tries to find a neighbour with the same colour and if succeeds it goes to that neighbouring site . when it does not find any neighbour of its own colour , the particle dies .",
    "then the question is as before , what is the probability @xmath22 that the particle survives upto time @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding ",
    "static persistence \" exponent has been calculated exactly for all @xmath2 recently@xcite .",
    "our job for calculating the adaptive persistence for the @xmath2-state potts model is simplified by making the observation that the test particle survives as long as the original domain of the potts model that contained the test particle at @xmath16 survives .",
    "thus the adaptive persistence is precisely the survival probability of an  original domain \" that has recently been studied both numerically and analytically within an independent interval approximation ( iia ) for all @xmath2 by krapivsky and ben - naim@xcite .",
    "in fact , even for the diffusion equation , adaptive persistence is also the survival probability of an original domain .",
    "however , the iia approximation developed in@xcite for the potts model can not be easily extended to the diffusion equation for the following reason .",
    "the evolution of the potts model is particularly simple in terms of the domain walls where the field changes colour in space .",
    "these domain walls perform independent random walks ( the rates of which do not depend on the local spins ) and when two walls meet , they either annihilate ( with probability @xmath40 ) or aggregate ( with probability @xmath41 ) . therefore ,",
    "for the potts model it is quite simple to write down an evolution equation for @xmath42 ( probability that a domain of length @xmath43 contains @xmath44 original domains ) within iia@xcite and thereby calculate the domain survival probability .",
    "however , writing down a similar evolution equation for the diffusion equation does not seem to be easy as the domain walls in the diffusion equation ( i.e. , the zeroes of the diffusive field ) undergo complicated motion that depends upon the local field profile .",
    "however we want to stress that the concept of  adaptive persistence \" is more general than just being equivalent to the persistence of a pattern , e.g.,the domain survival probability in case of potts model or diffusion equation .",
    "in fact , it does not necessarily require that the evolving field has domain structures coarsening in time .",
    "for example , even in the simplest case where at each site of the lattice there is an independent brownian signal ( completely uncorrelated spatially ) , one can define the  adaptive persistence \" and has a nontrivial exponent as we will show below via an exact solution . in cases when the evolving field has a structure of coarsening domains ,",
    "the adaptive persistence is equivalent to the domain survival probability .",
    "we now turn to the last case for which we present an exact solution of the adaptive persistence . in this case , the field is spatially uncorrelated brownian signal at each lattice site , @xmath45 where @xmath46 s are spatially uncorrelated gaussian white noises with zero mean and @xmath47 .",
    "a test particle is launched as usual at @xmath16 at the origin .",
    "let us assume that the signal at the origin at @xmath16 is positive .",
    "the particle does not move as long as the sign of the signal @xmath21 at the origin does not change sign .",
    "when it does , the particle either dies with probability @xmath48 or survives with probability @xmath49 and then tries to jump to its neighbour on the _ right _ hand side .",
    "if the sign of the signal at that neighbour is positive at the time of jumping , the particle stays there till the signal is positive there and so on . finally , if it does not find a _",
    "right _ neighbour with a positive signal at the moment of jumping , the particle dies . note the two new aspects in this problem from before .",
    "a survival factor @xmath49 is introduced .",
    "@xmath50 is the fully adapted case considered earlier for the diffusion equation or the potts model .",
    "@xmath51 will correspond to the  static persistence \" .",
    "the second aspect is that the motion of the particle is _ directed _ as opposed to the _ undirected _ case considered for the diffusion equation or the potts model .",
    "this assumption of _ directedness _ turns out to be important for exact solution and thus serves as an useful exactly solvable toy model of adaptive persistence .",
    "it turns out , as we show below , that the exponent @xmath18 can be calculated exactly and depends on the parameter @xmath49 continuously .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the probability that a brownian signal at a given site does not change sign from time @xmath53 to time @xmath1 .",
    "this is the usual static persistence , which can be computed exactly since it is a markovian process and is given by , @xmath54@xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the probability that the signal crosses zero for the first time at time @xmath1 .",
    "then clearly , @xmath56 .",
    "then the probability of no zero crossing @xmath57 for the adaptive particle is given by the convolution , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and so on .",
    "the first term is the probability that the sign of the signal at the starting site did not change upto time @xmath1 and hence the particle did not jump at all .",
    "the second term denotes the probability that the particle jumped once .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is the survival factor and @xmath60 is the probability that the sign of the signal of the right neighbour ( to which the particle jumps ) is positive .",
    "the third term denotes the probability that the particle jumped twice and so on .    to perform the convoluted integrals in eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , we make a change of variable , @xmath61 . in this new variable ,",
    "the effective process that the particle sees , though not gaussian , becomes stationary .",
    "one can then use the laplace transforms to solve eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) .",
    "let @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the respective laplace transforms of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then , by taking the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , one gets , @xmath68 using the realtion , @xmath69 , one further gets , @xmath70 .",
    "this enables us to write @xmath71 entirely in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath72    we expect @xmath57 to decay as @xmath73 for large @xmath1 .",
    "this means that in the variable @xmath74 , @xmath75 for large @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the laplace transform @xmath62 will have a pole at @xmath77 , i.e. , the denominator of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lap ] ) will have a zero at @xmath77 .",
    "using @xmath78 , one therefore sees that that the exponent @xmath18 is given by the positive root of @xmath79 this integration can be evaluated by parts and one finally gets , @xmath80= { { 2\\pi}\\over { p}}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 $ ] is the usual beta function .",
    "it is clear that in the limit , @xmath82 , one recovers the usual  static \" persistence exponent @xmath83 . for the fully adapted model ( @xmath50 )",
    ", we get @xmath84 which agrees very well with our numerical simulations .",
    "it is also clear that for any nonzero @xmath49 , the adaptive exponent @xmath85 as expected .",
    "the reason that the exponent @xmath18 is exactly soluble for the _ directed _ case is that the effective process seen by the test particle is markovian . in the _",
    "undirected _ case , this is not so because the particle can jump back to a site already visited before and therefore the probability that the signal is positive there at the time of current jumping is conditioned by the fact that the signal had crossed zero there at some earlier time .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to compute @xmath18 exactly for the _ undirected _ case .",
    "in the previous section we considered the adaptive motion of the test external noise . in this section we consider the other case when there is only noise and no adaption . in this case",
    "the particle just moves randomly through the medium in which a field @xmath7 is evolving according to its own prescribed dynamics .",
    "as before , the test particle is launched at the origin at @xmath16 where the sign of the field is positive ( say ) at @xmath16 .",
    "the particle then performs a brownian motion , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and the correlator , @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath29 denotes the position of the particle from some fixed reference point .",
    "the motion of the field and that of the particle are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the particle dies when the field that it sees changes sign .",
    "then we ask : what is the probability that the particle survives upto time @xmath1 ?",
    "we first consider the case when the field @xmath7 is evolving according to diffusion equation , @xmath89 .",
    "we performed numerical simulation to compute the survival probability of the test particle .",
    "this probability decays as a power law , @xmath90 for large @xmath1 where the exponent @xmath91 is found to depend continuously on the ratio of the two diffusion constants , @xmath92 .",
    "the results are presented in the second column of table ( 1 ) under the heading @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear from this table that for any nonzero @xmath94 , @xmath95 where @xmath9 is the corresponding  static \" persistence exponent , i.e. , when @xmath96 .",
    "this continuous non - universal dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath94 is , however , not very surprising for the following reason .",
    "the test particle dies whenever it crosses any ",
    "zero \" of the field @xmath23 .",
    "thus two zeros of the field on either side of the test particle act like two boundary walls .",
    "but these walls are not static .",
    "they themselves are moving as the field @xmath23 is evolving in time .",
    "in fact , since the typical distance between zeroes of the diffusing field increases as @xmath97 , the walls bounding the test particle are therefore diffusing as @xmath97 . this particular case is known to be marginal@xcite in the sense that the exponent , characterizing the power law decay of survival probibility of the particle , depends continuously on the ratio of the diffusion constants of the particle and the walls .",
    "while this explains qualitatively why @xmath91 depends continuously on @xmath94 , it does not give any quantitative estimate of the exponent . to make progress in that direction ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath30 be the coordinate of an arbitrary point in space measured from the rest frame of the particle .",
    "then the field @xmath32 as seen by the particle evolves as , @xmath98 the field @xmath99 and the noise @xmath100 are completely uncorrelated .",
    "note that for a given realization of the noise process @xmath101 , the process @xmath31 at a fixed @xmath30 as a function of @xmath1 is a gaussian process .",
    "however , when the distribution of @xmath87 is also taken into consideration , @xmath31 at a fixed @xmath30 no longer has a gaussian distribution due to the multiplicative nature of the noise in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to calculate the the two time correlator , @xmath102 that characterizes the temporal process at the location of the particle , i.e. , at @xmath33 .",
    "this can be easily performed in the @xmath103 space where the solution is given by , @xmath104 we then compute @xmath105 where the @xmath106 is done over both the initial conditions of @xmath99 and the history of the noise @xmath100 .",
    "the initial consition is taken to random , so that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a constant .",
    "since the noise @xmath100 is gaussian white noise , we use the property , @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "it is then easy to see that in @xmath110 , @xmath111 the normalized autocorrelator , @xmath112 when expressed in terms of the variable @xmath113 , becomes stationary , i.e. , only a function of the time difference @xmath114 . denoting , for convenience , this time difference by @xmath76",
    ", one finds that the stationary autocorrelator @xmath115 is given by , @xmath116 where @xmath92 is the ratio of the two diffusion constants .",
    "note that for @xmath96 , @xmath115 reduces to the  static \" autocorrelator @xmath117^{-1/2}$]@xcite .",
    "however , there is an important difference between @xmath96 and @xmath118 cases . for @xmath96 , the stochastic stationary process ,",
    "whose correlator is given by @xmath119 , is gaussian . however , for @xmath118 , while the process is still stationary in the variable @xmath76 , it is non - gaussian as mentioned earlier .",
    "this is evident from eq.([fourier ] ) , since @xmath120 is a product of two random variables , @xmath121 and @xmath122 $ ] and hence is not clearly gaussian , even though both @xmath121 and @xmath123 are individually gaussian .",
    "therefore , the approximate method developed@xcite for the case @xmath96 , to compute the asymptotic distribution of the interval between successive zero crossings , @xmath124 for large @xmath1 , can not be simply extended to the @xmath118 case .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to calculate @xmath91 by approximating the process by a gaussian process having the same two - point correlator for two reasons .",
    "first , comparision between @xmath91 obtained numerically for the actual process and that obtained for the corresponding gaussian process will tell us how important are the non gaussian effects .",
    "secondly , there have been some recent developments@xcite in approximate analytical calculations of the exponent for gaussian stationary processes which one can use in the present context .",
    "therefore , in the following , our strategy would be to to estimate the exponent @xmath125 ( that characterizes the exponential decay of the distribution of intervals between successive zero crossings , @xmath126 for large @xmath76 ) for the gaussian process with the correlator @xmath115 as in eq .",
    "( [ auto ] ) and then compare it with the @xmath91 for the actual process .    we first present the numerical results for @xmath125 for the gaussian process with the correlator as in eq .",
    "( [ auto ] ) .",
    "this is done by constructing a time series having the same corelation function .",
    "it is most conveninent to work in the frequency domain rather than time domain .",
    "details of this simulation procedure can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results of @xmath125 for different values of @xmath94 are presented in the third column of table ( 1 ) . by comparing column ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", it is evident that the non - gaussian effects are indeed quite small , and gaussian approximation seems to be quite good .",
    "however , exact analytical calculation of @xmath125 even for a gaussian stationary process with a general corelator @xmath115 is difficult and remains an unsolved problem for many years@xcite .",
    "exact results are known only in a few special cases@xcite .",
    "one such case is when @xmath127 for all @xmath76 . in this case",

    "presumably the mean field value forms a lower bound to the true exponent value , though we have not been able to prove it",
    ".    however , one can obtain rigorous upper bounds to @xmath161 as follows .",
    "this can be done by generalizing the arguments used by derrida@xcite to obtain upper bounds to the",
    " static \" persistence exponent @xmath176 .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "it was noted by monthus@xcite that the problem of a diffusing tracer particle moving amongst the domain walls of the potts model can be mapped to a reaction diffusion problem where particles are generated from a source , diffuse around and aggregate upon contact .",
    "the only difference from the  static \" case@xcite was that the source is now  moving \" .",
    "in fact the source diffuses with the same diffusion constant as the tracer particle .",
    "it is then possible to write the survival probability @xmath159 as@xcite , @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the probability of having @xmath44 particles in the corresponding reaction diffusion problem . writing the above equation for @xmath179 in the following way ,",
    "@xmath180 , @xmath181^{{\\log q_2}/{\\log q_1}},\\ ] ] and then using jensen s inequality [ @xmath182 for @xmath183 and @xmath30 a positive random variable ] as was used in the  static \" case@xcite , we immediately obtain the following inequality , @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "for example , using the exact result , @xmath186 for @xmath153 and the above inequality we get , @xmath187 for @xmath188 , this gives @xmath189 , which should be compared with its numerical value @xmath190 .",
    "for higher values of @xmath2 , one can have a numerical estimate of a tighter upper bound of @xmath161 by using the numerical value of @xmath191 in the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "this would be an improvement over the exact bound ( [ q ] ) obtained by comparing with @xmath153 .",
    "these improved numerical bounds @xmath192 are presented in the column ( 3 ) of table ( 2 ) .",
    "it was pointed out by monthus@xcite that carrying out the same formalism that led to the exact determination of the static persistence exponent @xmath176@xcite is not so straighforward to compute the exact value of @xmath147 for general @xmath94 .",
    "however , one may hope that some special simplifications might occur for @xmath130 leading to the exact computation of the exponent @xmath161 though we have not succeded yet in that direction .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the persistence of some patterns present in the initial configuration of a fluctuating field .",
    "it was shown that some of these pattern persistence problems are related to the survival probability of a mobile particle launched into the field . by suitably adjusting the rules of the dynamics of the particle one",
    "can study persistence of different patterns in the underlying field .",
    "this led us to study the pf problem in general .",
    "several special cases were studied in detail and new results were derived .",
    "it is clear from ours as well as other studies that there is a whole hierarchy of exponents associated with the decay of persistence of different patterns in the phase ordering systems .",
    "it is not clear at present whether these exponents are independent of each other or not . while these exponents do not depend on the details of the initial configuration ( as long as it is short ranged )",
    ", it is not clear whether they can be considered  universal \" and if so , in what sense .",
    "for example , if the diffusion constant of any single domain wall of the potts model changes slightly , then the exponent @xmath163 characterizing the decay of survival of the wall ( probability that it remains uncollided ) also changes . clearly in this respect the exponent is non - universal .",
    "so the important question that remains to be answered is : what are the criteria one should use to decide whether an exponent in the phase ordering dynamics is universal or not ?",
    "one of the interesting extensions of the present work would be to study the pf problem when the fluctuating field is the height of an interface in or approaching the steady state .",
    "the  static \" persistence for interfaces have been recently studied in some detail@xcite .",
    "also anomalous diffusive behaviour of a tracer particle on a solid - on - solid surface was noted@xcite and was attributed to the temporary trapping or burial of the particle in the bulk of the crystal . besides , given that sophisticated techniques using scannning tunneling microscope already exist for determining temporal step fluctuations on crystal surfaces@xcite , it is not unreasonable to hope that such techniques may be refined in future to measure the survival probabilities of the  static \" as well as the  mobile \" particle in a fluctuating interface .",
    "finally it has recently been noted@xcite that  static \" persistence exponent for the diffusion equation may possibly be measured in dense spin - polarized noble gases ( @xmath193he and @xmath194xe ) using nmr spectroscopy and imaging@xcite . in these systems the polarization acts like a diffusing field . with a slight modification these systems",
