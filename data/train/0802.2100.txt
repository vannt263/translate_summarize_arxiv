    "baryons make up about 4.5% of the mass / energy budget of the universe , and only 1/6 of its matter density . at @xmath0 the vast majority of baryons",
    "are thought to exist in the form of coronal and intergalactic gas , at temperatures @xmath1 k ; @xmath2 is a tiny 0.0027 and @xmath3 an even smaller 0.0008 , of which a bit over half is neutral hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "this unimpressive budgetary datum could well prompt the question : why do we care about hi ?",
    "several reasons for caring are relevant to the purview of this conference .",
    "first , hi is easy to detect at 21 cm wavelength , most of the emission originates in optically thin regions and cold gas masses are reliably measured ; the abundance of cold gas is a reliable indicator of star forming potential for an extragalactic system .",
    "second , the distribution of hi , which extends farther out than other easily detectable components in a galaxy , makes it an excellent tracer of the large  scale dynamics of its host .",
    "third , scaling relations of disks , such as that between luminosity and rotational width , make hi measurements good cosmological tools : for example in the measurement of @xmath4 , peculiar velocities , the convergence depth of the universe and the local matter density field .",
    "fourth , because of its distribution at relatively large galactocentric distances , hi is vulnerable to external influences and thus constitutes a good tracer of tidal interactions , mergers and other environmental effects .",
    "fifth , it can be the dominant baryonic component in low mass galaxies and thus provide a reliable census of low mass systems in the galactic hierarchy . hence , alfalfa .",
    "wide angle surveys of the extragalactic hi sky became possible with the advent of multifeed front ",
    "end systems at l  band .",
    "the first such system with spectroscopic capability was installed on the 64  m parkes telescope in australia , and has produced the excellent results of the hipass survey @xcite .",
    "the 1990s upgrade of the arecibo telescope optics made it possible for that telescope to host feed arrays , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "eventually a 7-beam radio `` camera '' , named alfa ( arecibo l  band feed array ) , became operational enabling large  scale mapping projects with the great sensitivity of the 305m telescope .",
    "alfalfa will map the extragalactic hi emission at @xmath5  over 7074 . exploiting the large collecting area of the arecibo antenna and its relatively small beam size ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "alfalfa will be eight times more sensitive than hipass with @xmath7four times better angular resolution .",
    "the combination of sensitivity and angular resolution allows dramatically improved ability in determining the position of hi sources , a detail of paramount importance in the identification of source counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , its spectral backend provides 3 times better spectral resolution ( 5.3  at @xmath8 ) and over 1.4 times more bandwidth .",
    "these advantages offer new opportunities to explore the extragalactic hi sky .",
    "a comparison of alfalfa and other past and current hi surveys is given in table 1 .",
    "data taking for alfalfa was initiated in february 2005 and , in the practical context of time allocation at a widely used , multidisciplinary national facility , completion of the full survey is projected to require a total of 6 years .    cccccccc survey & beam & area & res & rms@xmath9 & v@xmath10 & n@xmath11 & ref + & ( ) & ( ) & ( ) & & ( ) & & + ahiss & 3.3 & 13 & 16 & 0.7 & 4800 & 65 & @xmath12 + adbs & 3.3 & 430 & 34 & 3.3 & 3300 & 265 & @xmath13 + wsrt & 49 . &",

    "some of the main science goals to be addressed by alfalfa which are of special relevance to these proceedings include : ( i ) the determination and environmental variance of the hi mass function , especially at its faint end and its impact on the abundance of low mass halos ; ( ii ) the large  scale structure characteristics of hi sources , their impact on the `` void problem '' and metallicity issues ; ( iii ) providing a blind survey for hi tidal remnants and `` cold accretion '' ; ( iv ) determining a direct characterization of the hi diameter function ; ( v ) the alfalfa survey area includes @xmath25 continuum sources with fluxes sufficiently large to make useful measurements of hi optical depth , and hence to provide a low z link with dla absorbers .",
    "the minimum integration time per beam in seconds @xmath26 necessary for alfa to detect an hi source of hi mass @xmath27 , width @xmath28 , at a distance @xmath29 is @xmath30 where the exponent @xmath31 for @xmath32 and increases to @xmath33 for sources of larger width .",
    "thus the depth of the survey , i.e. the maximum distance at which a given hi mass can be detected , increases only as @xmath34 .",
    "a corollary of this scaling law is the fact that , once @xmath27 is detectable at an astrophysically satisfactory distance , it is more advantageous to maximize the survey solid angle than to increase the depth of the survey through longer dwell times . in passing ,",
    "we note that the @xmath26 required to detect a given @xmath27 at a given distance decreases as the 4th power of the telescope diameter : arecibo offers a tremendous advantage because of its huge primary reflector .",
    "the effective integration time per beam area of alfalfa is of order of 40 sec , which yields a minimum detectable hi mass of @xmath35 @xmath36 at the distance of the virgo cluster and in a catalog of sources with a median @xmath37 . as of mid2007",
    ", 44% of the survey solid angle has been fully mapped .",

    "http://egg.astro.cornell.edu / alfalfa_.    two catalogs of hi sources extracted from 3-d spectral data cubes have been accepted for publication in 2007 @xcite @xcite , and several others are in preparation . as of summer of 2007 , more than 5000 hi sources have been identified , over a solid angle representing 15% of the total alfalfa survey .",
    "figure [ cones ] shows those sources in the framework of two wedge plots , corresponding to contiguous declination strips . while the two strips are non - overlapping , repeatability of the large scale features bears witness to the correlation scale in the galaxy distribution .",
    "note that , due to the impact of local rfi , alfalfa is effectively blind in the redshift range @xmath3815000 to 16000 .",
    "figure [ himd ] shows a hi mass vs. distance diagram of the hi sources in figure [ cones ] .",
    "two smooth lines are overplotted , identifying respectively the completeness limit ( dotted ) and the detection limit ( dashed ) for sources of 200 linewidth for the hipass survey .",
    "this diagram dramatically illustrates the improvement alfalfa represents , over previous surveys .",
    "the median redshift of the catalog is @xmath77800  and its distribution reflects the known local large scale structure .",

    "for the same set of sources , the top panel on the right of fig .",
    "[ himd ] displays s / n vs. velocity width , while the bottom panel displays the flux integral vs. velocity width .",
    "the quality of the alfalfa signal extraction is apparent : the s / n of detections exhibits no significant bias with respect to velocity width .",
    "spectroscopic hi surveys are not single flux limited .",
    "the flux limit rises as @xmath39 for low velocity widths , changing to a linear rise for the wider line profiles .",
    "such a transition is observed near @xmath40 .",

    "the positional accuracy of hi sources is a very important survey parameter , especially in the identification of hi sources with sources at other wavelengths .",
    "the quality of the positional centroiding of a source depends roughly linearly on source s / n and inversely on the telescope beam angular size .",
    "consider , for example , a source barely detected by hipass at s / n@xmath42 .",
    "the error box of its positioning will have a radius of approximately 2.5. the same source can be detected by alfalfa with @xmath43 ; as the arecibo beam is about 4 times smaller than that of parkes , the positional error box for the alfalfa observation is @xmath44 , thus making an optical identification far more reliable .",

    ", interesting statistical properties are starting to emerge from the alfalfa data , some of which are illustrated in m. haynes s presentation in these proceedings .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to discussion of hi sources with no obvious optical counterparts in the virgo cluster region .",
    "what should we refer to as a `` dark galaxy '' ( perhaps a misnomer ) ?",
    "a dark galaxy would be a starless halo , yet detectable at other than optical wavelengths , possibly in hi or through lensing experiments .",
    "such objects are likely to exist , but hard to find . within the cdm galaxy formation paradigm",
    ", such objects would have relatively low mass , were unable to form stars before re  ionization and either lost their baryons or were prevented from cooling them thereafter , by the ig ionizing flux . yet we know of low mass galaxies in the local group which not only made stars early on , presumably before re  ionization , but they were also capable of retaining cold gas and make stars at later cosmic times .",
    "why then should we not expect the existence of low mass systems that were unable to form stars but have retained baryons and have been able to cool them , as the ig ionizing flux rarefies ?",
    "we have extremely little observational evidence for the existence of such systems .",
    "the sw component of the system known as hi1225 + 01 @xcite has @xmath45 and exhibits evidence for dynamical independence ( a very small amplitude rotation curve ) from the ne component , which has an optical counterpart .",
    "however , the sw component is not an isolated object and it can not be excluded that it originated from a high speed tidal encounter of the ne component with a now remote passer  by , as the system lies in the outskirts of the virgo cluster . in that case",
    "the velocity gradients interpreted as a rotation curve may just be tidal .",
    "the burden on observers is that of finding isolated systems resembling hi1225 + 01sw .",
    "virgohi21 was discovered at jodrell bank , corroborated by arecibo and wsrt observations ( @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "it lies some 100 kpc n of ngc4254 , in the nw periphery of the virgo cluster , projected @xmath46 mpc from the cluster center and has a relative velocity of more than 1000 with respect to the cluster . because of its large separation from optical galaxies and the gradient seen in its velocity field , it was interpreted by its discoverers as a dark galaxy .",
    "the alfalfa data suggest a different scenario .",
    "the left  hand panel in figure [ virgohi21_pv ] displays alfalfa contours of hi flux , superimposed on an optical image , showing a gas streamer extending some 250 kpc n of ngc 4254 .",
    "the velocity field of the stream , which matches the velocity of ngc4254 to the s , is shown on the center panel of the figure .",
    "the observations by the previous group did not reveal the hi stream in its full extent : what they called virgohi21 is the bright section of the hi stream extending from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the hi mass in the disk of ngc2454 is @xmath49 m@xmath50 and that associated with the stream is @xmath51 m@xmath50 .",
    "one of the driving arguments for the interpretation of virgohi21 as an isolated disk galaxy is the gradient seen in the velocity field@xcite ; alfalfa data shows that gradient to be just a part of the varying , large  scale velocity field along the stream .",
    "ngc 4254 is a system well known for its prominent @xmath52 southern spiral arm .",
    "it is reasonable to postulate that this special feature is related with the existence of the stream .",
    "note the following :    * ngc 4254 moves at a large velocity with respect to the cluster ( @xmath53 ) and lies at a projected distance of @xmath7 1 mpc from m87 . *",
    "the prominent m=1 arm is visible in the gas and in the disk stellar population : gravity , rather than hydro phenomena such as ram pressure , is at work . *",
    "the hi mass in the stream is only @xmath54% of that in the ngc 4254 disk : the disturbance of ngc 4254 is relatively mild ( it would not , in fact be classified as an hi deficient galaxy ) . *",
    "the velocity field of the stream shows the coupling of the tidal force and the rotation of ngc 4254 , which suggests an interesting timing argument : 1 .",
    "the stream exhibits memory of a full rotational cycle of the ngc 4254 disk ; 2 .   from the ngc 4254 vla map of @xcite",
    ", we can get the present outer radius of the hi disk ( 18.5 kpc ) and the rotational velocity at that radius ( 150 ) ; from those we compute a rotation period of @xmath55 myr . *",
    "hence we estimate that the tidal encounter which gave rise to the stream initiated some 800 myr ago , a time comparable with the cluster crossing time . if the interaction resulted from a high speed ( of order of 1000 , the velocity differential between ngc 4254 and the cluster ) close encounter with another galaxy and/or the cluster potential , the culprit for the tidal damage would now be @xmath46 gpc away .",
    "we conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the system is that of a relatively mild episode of harassment , resulting from the high speed passage of ngc 4254 through the cluster periphery .",
    "these results are discussed in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "duc & bournaud @xcite have produced a computer simulation of a high speed encounter of ngc 4254 with another peripheral cluster galaxy .",
    "the simulation matches extremely well both the morphology and the velocity field of the stream .",
    "a comparison of the model and the alfalfa data is shown in figures [ virgohi21 ] ( stream morphology ) and [ virgohi21_pv ] , right hand panel ( position  velocity ) .",
    "the culprit responsible for the harassment of ngc 4254 could now be located far from ngc 4254 .",
    "the authors of the simulation speculate that , given its location and velocity , the culprit could be m 98 = ngc 4192 .",
    "alfalfa finds an extended hi appendage apparently emanating from that galaxy .",
    "the overall evidence for virgohi21 to be part of the phenomenology associated with a tidal episode of harassment , rather than an isolated `` dark galaxy '' is thus quite strong .",
    "this pair of galaxies is located to the south of the virgo cluster .",
    "the two galaxies are of late type ( smiii / smiv ) and very gas rich .",
    "arecibo observations ( @xcite  and refs . therein ) revealed that some of the hi in the system is well beyond the optical disks of the two galaxies .",
    "vla observations@xcite   confirmed those results .",
    "alfalfa maps expand on both of those results , revealing the presence of cold gas at significantly larger galactocentric distances than previously realized .",
    "the left panel of figure [ koop ] covers a solid angle of about 3 , with a bold solid contour approximately tracing the outer envelope of the hi gas reported by @xcite . within that region",
    ", alfalfa@xcite detects an hi mass of 6.2 x 10@xmath56 , in agreement with previous reports .",
    "an additional 1.3 x 10@xmath57   is contained within a partially resolved clump @xmath7 20@xmath58 west of ngc 4532 , labelled ` western clump ' ( wc ) .",
    "a set of discrete clumps , numbered 1 through 8 , outline the ridges of two streams , connected by low column density emission not displayed by the contour plots .",
    "they have hi masses varying between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "clumps 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 8 outline one stream , while clumps 7 and 8 appear to be on a separate stream .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure [ koop ] provides an elementary position - velocity map of the system , showing the streamer system apparently emerging from the low velocity side of ngc 4532 ( solid contours ) .",
    "no apparent optical counterparts are seen associated with wc and the numbered clumps in the system ; the overall hi mass associated with them is about 5 to @xmath61 , which is approximately 10% of the galaxy pair s hi mass , a ratio similar to that of the stream  to  galaxy in the ngc 4254 system discussed above . at the virgo cluster distance ,",
    "the stream system associated with ngc 4532/ddo 137 extends over 500 kpc . as in the case of ngc 4254 ,",
    "the disturbance is spectacular , but the `` damage '' caused to the galaxy pair appears to be mild .",
    "the size , velocity and other characteristics of the system suggest , again , a galaxy harassment scenario .",
    "modelling of the interaction that may have caused the streams is underway .",
    "roughly halfway in the sky between m87 and m49 , alfalfa detects a conspicuous complex of hi clouds , shown in figure [ complex ] .",
    "the nearest optical galaxy with a velocity near that of the complex is ngc 4424 , located some 40 w of the complex center .",
    "an optical image of ngc 4424 is shown in figure [ complex ] , at its approximate sky location with respect to the cloud complex .",
    "the optical image is however enlarged by a factor of 2.5 with respect to the features shown in the hi map .",
    "the velocities of the individual clouds are ( s to n ) 476 , 490 , 601 , 605 and 527 , and their velocity widths are 48 , 66 , 45 , 257 and 120 .",
    "ngc 4424 has heliocentric velocity of 441 . at the virgo cluster distance ,",
    "the individual clouds in the complex have hi masses between @xmath62  ( to the se ) and @xmath63 .",
    "the total hi mass of the complex is @xmath64 .",
    "the hi mass of ngc 4424 is @xmath65 . given its hi mass and optical size , ngc 4424 is very hi deficient ( @xmath66 , corresponding to having lost most of its cold gas@xcite ) .",
    "stretching over 200 kpc ( at the virgo cluster distance ) , the cloud complex does not appear to be gravitationally bound . with cloud",
    " to  cloud velocity differences of order of 100 , the mean cloud separation will double over @xmath46 gyr . the complex thus appears to be a transient phenomenon .",
    "plausible interpretations of its nature are : ( a ) detached ism from a single galaxy , either by ram pressure or tidal forces ; ( b ) group of mini halos falling in the cluster for the first time .",
    "the absence of conspicuous ( given the velocity widths involved ) optical counterparts argues strongly ( b ) .",
    "the hi deficiency and other properties of ngc 4424 are is strongly suggestive of environment  driven mechanisms at work , and likelihood of association with the cloud complex .",
    "occam s razor does not favor the idea of a cluster of dark galaxies , albeit the possibility that some of the clumps may give rise to the formation of tidal dwarfs is an attractive hypothesis .",
    "ngc 4192 = m 98 is a galaxy located in the nw periphery of the virgo cluster , with a negative @xmath67 ) indicative of large relative motion with respect to the cluster itself .",
    "a number of hi clouds with velocities between 60 and 100  are found in its vicinity , spectrally well separated from milky way emission .",
    "they would typically be cataloged as high ( or intermediate ) velocity clouds , perigalactic ( or local group ) dwellers , and most of them may very well be just that .",
    "some of the clouds , however , appear to stream out of m 98 , stretching over more than @xmath68 , well matched both spatially and kinematically to the disk of m 98 .",
    "the characteristics of this system are under close scrutiny .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that @xcite suggest that m 98 may be the culprit responsible for the harassment of ngc 4254 , observed in the form of the stream virgohi21 is a part of .",
    "alfalfa has detected several other features lacking obvious counterparts , as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "figure [ cl2 ] shows two such examples : the hi sources are unresolved by the arecibo beam and thus extend fewer than @xmath69 kpc at the virgo distance , at which their hi masses would be @xmath70 ( left panel ) and @xmath71 ( right panel ) ; the second object may however be part of the m cloud , in the background of the cluster .",
    "no clear clues are available as to the nature of these objects .",
    "they are sufficiently removed from the cluster center that ram pressure effects are small . while the possibility that they may be primordial remains open , the likelihood is high that they may constitute tidal remnants , the consequence of events such as those discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the hi content and extent of hi disks of galaxies that venture in the inner regions of clusters have been known to be strongly affected(@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ virgo ]  clearly illustrates the matter .",
    "about 200 hi sources are detected by alfalfa in the virgo region shown in that graph ; they are identified by blue circles , the area of which is proportional to the hi mass , varying between @xmath35 and @xmath72 .",
    "the orange  to  red contours represent the intensity of the x  ray emission , as imaged by rosat @xcite . in hi ,",
    "the virgo cluster appears as a ring of emission surrounding the x  ray emiting igm .",
    "sources detected in the inner parts of the cluster typically correspond to highly hi deficient galaxies .",
    "the red stars in the graph show the locations of hi sources found by alfalfa not to have obvious optical counterparts .",
    "the vast majority of those lie in the outer parts of the cluster and are possibly remnants of tidal events . with a complete census of the hi sources in the cluster",
    " a goal nearly at hand  and a fair understanding of the cluster structure and dynamics , it will soon be possible to estimate the frequency and longevity of environment driven events in the nearest cluster to us .",
    "it is interesting to conclude with the emerging realization that the wealth of optically inert sources found in the vicinity of the cluster does not appear to be matched in other regions for which alfalfa mapping is becoming complete .",
    "this work has been supported by nsf grants ast0307661 , ast0435697 , ast0607007 . the arecibo observatory is part of the national astronomy which is operated by cornell university under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
