    "[ fig8_experimental_morphologyii](a ) , we plot the location @xmath106 of the first maximum of both @xmath97 and @xmath98 as a function of @xmath0 . since the two curves agree excellently with each other ,",
    "we conclude that the average cluster area and perimeter reach their extreme values for the same @xmath28 for each @xmath0 , which is plausible .",
    "clearly , for low @xmath0 , @xmath106 lies close to the particle radius @xmath7 , indicating that neighboring particles in this antinode cluster regime are relatively close to one another in all spatial directions . at the boundary of the intermediate regime , the location of the maximum shifts quite suddenly to @xmath112 as an indication of the formation of loose filamentary structures with holes in the order of 10 particle radii .",
    "when @xmath0 increases even further , the location of the maximum shifts back to lower values of @xmath28 , because the system as a whole is becoming denser , and consequently the holes in between structures necessarily become smaller again . from the corresponding maxima themselves [ fig .",
    "[ fig8_experimental_morphologyii](b ) ] a similar picture emerges . for the antinode clusters ( small @xmath0 )",
    ", the average cluster size is small , and in the intermediate region rises quite steeply to an approximately constant large value , which it keeps inside the node cluster region ( large @xmath0 ) .    finally , in fig .  [ fig8_experimental_morphologyii](c ) , we plot the maximum value of the average aspect ratio @xmath108 in the grey area of fig .",
    "[ fig6_experimental_characterization](c ) . for low @xmath0 , there is no maximum value and @xmath113 throughout the shaded region , but then a finite maximum @xmath114 suddenly appears for @xmath115 , as evidence of the formation of structures that are elongated rather than circular . for higher @xmath0 , the maximum @xmath108 gradually decreases again and becomes approximately equal to 2 in the grid - shaped node clusters .",
    "the pattern analysis performed in this paper gives us an extensive characterization of the experimentally observed clustering patterns as a function of @xmath0 . in our previous study  @xcite ,",
    "the clustering patterns have also been examined by introducing the global correlation coefficient @xmath116 , which nicely separate the antinode ( low @xmath0 ) and the node ( high @xmath0 ) clusters as a function of @xmath0 with a broad intermediate transition region . in agreement with @xmath116 ,",
    "the intermediate transition region suggested by the global analysis lies in the same region as the one indicated by @xmath116 .",
    "( the analysis here suggests a slightly larger intermediate transition region . ) in addition to what we could learn from @xmath116 , we can now also understand the detailed morphology of the clusters .",
    "even though the minkowski point pattern analysis developed in this paper mainly aims to quantifying the clustering patterns globally , local information can also deduced from the derived quantities such as @xmath106 as was discussed above [ fig .",
    "[ fig8_experimental_morphologyii](a ) ] .",
    "we have characterized the morphology of the experimentally observed clusters as a function of the floater concentration @xmath0 from the antinode clusters to the node cluster regime . in a global picture ,",
    "cluster area , perimeter , and aspect ratio are quantified utilizing the minkowski functional point pattern approach .",
    "the results show the large variety of floater patterns generated as a result of the competition between the attractive capillary force and the drift due to the standing wave . on this large scale , we can distinguish three regions : circular antinode clusters ( low @xmath0 ) , filamentary and more heterogenous clusters ( intermediate @xmath0 ) , and grid - shaped node clusters ( high @xmath0 ) .",
    "this richness in the clustering patterns explains the broad transitional region between the antinode and node clusters , and why it is difficult to pinpoint the transition at a single @xmath0 . in the energy argument of refs .",
    "@xcite , only hexagonally symmetric patterns were designed without considering the rich morphological details of the structures that form at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "however , in this paper , we successfully characterize these details . in future work",
    ", one could improve the energy argument of the previous work by incorporating these details .    in conclusion",
    ", this paper is devoted to developing a detailed methodology to characterize the complex floater patterns we observed in the experiment .",
    "we believe that the methods developed here are applicable to other physical , chemical , biological , and also social systems that exhibit pattern formation , in order to learn more about common large scale motion observed in particulate flow , and so to examine to what degree there is universality in these large scale behaviors .",
