    "over the past 10 - 20 years a multitude of kinetic and macroscopic models have been introduced to investigate the formation and movement of various biological aggregations : from cells @xcite and bacteria @xcite to flocks of birds , schools of fish and even human aggregations ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the use of kinetic or macroscopic approaches is generally dictated by the problem under investigation : ( i ) kinetic ( transport ) models focus on changes in the density distribution of individuals that have a certain spatial position , speed and movement direction ( or are in some activity state @xcite ) ; ( ii ) macroscopic models focus on changes in the averaged total density of individuals @xcite . due to their complex structure ,",
    "the kinetic models are more difficult to investigate .",
    "although progress has been made in the past years , mainly in regard to the existence and stability of various types of solutions exhibited by these models and the asymptotic methods that allow transitions from kinetic ( mesoscopic ) to macroscopic models ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein ) , it is still difficult to study the spatial and spatio - temporal aggregation patterns exhibited by the kinetic models .",
    "for example , there are very few studies that investigate the types of spatiotemporal patterns obtained with 2d and 3d kinetic models ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "generally , these kinetic and macroscopic models assume that individuals / particles / cells can organise themselves in the absence of a leader .",
    "the factors that lead to the formation of these self - organised aggregations are the interactions among individuals as a results of various social forces : repulsion from nearby neighbours , attraction to far - away neighbours ( or to roosting areas @xcite ) and alignment / orientation with neighbours positioned at intermediate distances .",
    "these interaction forces are usually assumed to act on different spatial ranges , depending on the communication mechanisms used by individuals ; e.g. , via acoustic long - range signals , or via chemical / visual short - range signals .",
    "the non - locality of the attractive and alignment / orientation interactions is supported by radar tracking observations of flocks of migratory birds , which can move with the same speed and in the same direction despite the fact that individuals are 200 - 300 meters apart from each other @xcite . for the repulsive forces",
    "some models consider non - local effects generated by decaying interactions with neighbours positioned further and further away @xcite , while other models consider only local effects @xcite . in the case of continuous mesoscopic and macroscopic models",
    ", these non - local interactions are modelled by interaction kernels ( see figure  [ spatial_ranges ] for 2d and 1d kernels ) .",
    "the most common choices for these kernels are morse potential - type kernels @xcite ( see figure [ spatial_ranges](b ) ) and gaussian kernels ( see figure [ spatial_ranges](c ) ) .",
    "the presence of these non - local interaction terms increases the complexity of the models , rendering them more difficult to be analysed mathematically ( see , for example , the 2d model introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "it also makes it more difficult to investigate numerically the types of spatial and spatio - temporal patterns exhibited by these models .",
    "in general , it is expected that these non - local models would exhibit a variety of patterns . while numerical and analytical studies have been conducted to investigate the patterns in 1d non - local models @xcite ,",
    "such an investigation is still difficult for 2d non - local models , see @xcite .",
    "another aspect not investigated enough by the existent studies is related to the multi - scale aspect of various self - organised biological aggregations and , in particular , the preservation of patterns between the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales . in the last two decade , various asymptotic methods have been employed to derive macroscopic - level models from kinetic models for self - organised biological aggregations ( see , for example , @xcite and the reference therein ) . while asymptotic preserving numerical schemes have been derived since late 1990 s to investigate the asymptotic dynamics of various transport models @xcite ,",

    "similar scalings have been done in one dimension in the context of bacterial chemotaxis @xcite and for the kinetic model ( [ 1d_model ] ) for individuals moving along a line @xcite . however , in 2d , the non - local dependence on the three types of social interactions adds another level of complexity compared to the 1d problem . moreover , to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of the models following the scaling approach",
    ", we also investigate whether various spatial and spatio - temporal patterns exhibited by the kinetic models are preserved in the limiting parabolic models . for simplicity ,",
    "here we focus only on the 1d case .",
    "we use asymptotic preserving methods to investigate numerically the preservation of stationary aggregations ( that arise via steady - state bifurcations ) and moving aggregations ( that arise via hopf bifurcations ) , as the scaling parameter @xmath0 is varied from large positive values ( @xmath1 ) corresponding to the kinetic models to zero values corresponding to the limiting parabolic models . to show the transitions between different patterns as @xmath14",

    "all these assumptions are incorporated into the following equation for the turning rates , where we denote @xmath28 the total population density :    @xmath29=&\\lambda_{1}+ \\lambda_3 \\big ( \\lambda_{2 } f(y_{n}[u ] ) +   f(y_{d}^{\\pm}[u^{+},u^{- } ] ) \\big ) .",
