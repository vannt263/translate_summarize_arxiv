    "the origin of brown dwarfs ( bds ) remains the subject of intense discussions .",
    "there are two broad ideas on their origin : 1 .  the classical star - like formation scenario of bds ( e.g. @xcite ) , and 2 .",
    "bds and some very - low - mass stars ( vlmss ) form as a separate population ( hereafter named bd - like besides the classical star - like population ) with a different formation history than stars , e.g. as ejected stellar embryos @xcite or as disrupted wide binaries @xcite .",
    "additionally , the formation of bds from jeans instabilities in high - density filaments near the centre of a massive star - forming cloud has been recently suggested implying such bds to be preferentially located in clusters with strong gravitational potentials @xcite .",
    "the star - like formation scenario fails to reproduce the observed different binary properties of bds and stars .",
    "especially the truncation of the semi - major axis distribution between 10 and 20  au for bds and the different mass - ratio distribution of bds and stars @xcite , as well as the bd desert @xcite , are difficult to account for if bds form indistinguishably to stars .",
    "this implies the need of treating bds as a separate population to stars .",
    "the assumption of two separate populations would then require two separate initial mass functions ( imfs ) of the individual bodies of a star cluster . although the observed mass function may appear approximately continuous from the lowest mass bds up to the highest mass stars @xcite ,",
    "a discontinuity in the imf may be present but be masked by ` hidden ' ( unresolved ) binaries only emerging if the observed mf is corrected for unresolved multiplicity .",
    "this issue has been discussed in greater detail in thies & kroupa ( 2007 , hereafter tk07 ) for the case of a low multiplicity of 15  of the bd - like population . however , a higher bd multiplicity between 20and 45  had been reported by some authors , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this raises the need , dealt with this contribution , for including higher multiplicities as well as for an analysis of the general effects of a high multiplicity on the imf and on the bd - to - star ratio .    in section [ sec : bdpop ]",
    "we review the evidence for a separate bd - like population .",
    "section [ sec : method ] briefly introduces the mathematical method of calculating the imf including unresolved binaries . in section [ sec : results ] the new results are presented and compared to those of tk07 .",
    "the summary follows in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "mass ratio distribution of binaries in a monte carlo sample cluster following the canonical stellar mass function (   [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "upper panel : binaries formed via random pairing over the complete mass range of a single population of bds and stars ( dots ) .",
    "the companions have masses down to 0.01  ( thin dashed line ) for all kinds of primaries .",
    "this is in contradiction with observations ( @xcite , black diamonds ) .",
    "lower panel : binaries from random pairing within separate populations of bds between 0.01 and 0.075  , and stars above 0.075  , i.e. there are no stellar companions below 0.075  ( thick dashed line ) .",
    "the resulting mass - ratio distribution fits well to the one observed by @xcite in the stellar regime .",
    "the regime of the ( approximately equal - mass companion ) bd - like binaries is indicated by the shaded region.,width=302 ]    it may be argued that by treating the bds as a separate population this forces an imf discontinuity near the stellar / sub - stellar mass limit by construction .",
    "indeed , the semi - major axis data and binary fraction ( here used as a simplification for the multiplicity , neglecting multiples of higher order , @xcite ) as a function of the primary mass can be interpreted to be continuous with no evidence for bds being a separate population @xcite .    given this argumentation ,",
    "it is essential to describe the methodology applied in our analysis : we seek one mathematical formulation which is a unification of the binary population for g- , k- , m - dwarfs and vlm - stars and bds .",
    "this is found to be possible for g- , k- and m - dwarfs : thus , for example , g - dwarfs have mostly k- and m - dwarf companions , and the period - distribution functions of g- , k- and m - dwarf primaries are indistinguishable .",
    "further , the mass - ratio and period - distribution functions for g- , k- and m - dwarf primaries derive from a single birth mass - ratio and period distribution which does not differentiate according to the mass of the primary @xcite . one single mathematical model can therewith be written down which treats g- , k- and m - dwarfs on exactly the same footing",
    " one can say that g- , k- and m - dwarf stars mix according to one rule ( random pairing from the imf at birth )",
    ".    if bds are to be introduced into a similar mathematical formulation which does not differentiate between bds and stars , then the model fails , because it leads to ( 1 ) a too wide bd period - distribution function , ( 2 ) too many bd binaries , ( 3 ) far too many stellar  bd binaries , and ( 4 ) far too few star ",
    "star binaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the mass - ratio of binaries depends on the primary - star mass in a way that results in an almost constant lower mass limit of the companions near 0.075  for the chamaeleon  i star - forming region ( see the figures 7 and 12 in their paper ) .",
    "this distribution can be reproduced by random pairing over the stellar mass range , while global random pairing over bds and stars yields a different distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ q2random ] . in order to avoid these failures , and in particular ,",
    "in order to incorporate the bd desert ( ` stars and bds do nt mix , while g , k and m dwarfs do mix ' ) into the mathematical formulation of the population , it is unavoidable to invent special mathematical rules for the bds .",
    "that is , stars and bds must be described separately .",
    "tk07 show that this necessarily implies a discontinuity in the imf , given the observational data .",
    "we emphasise that the observational mass distributions lead to this conclusion , once the correct mathematical description is incorporated consistently .",
    "however , tk07 assume a rather low binary fraction of the bd - like population of 15 .",
    "some papers @xcite that report the discovery of close bd binaries instead conclude that these may imply a significantly higher binary fraction between 20  and 45@xcite , the latter being similar to that of stars in dynamically evolved environments @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to re - address the problem tk07 posed by incorporating a larger bd binary fraction into the analysis .",
    "this contribution is , like tk07 , part of a series on the theoretical interpretation of observational stellar cluster data .",
    "@xcite showed for the first time that the true individual - body stellar imf is changed significantly by correcting for the bias due to unresolved binary stars .",
    "a detailed study in @xcite , in @xcite , and in @xcite of the observed binary properties of field stars , stars in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , the pleiades and the taurus - auriga association ( ta ) led to a thorough understanding of the energy distribution of binary systems .",
    "this work established that simply taking observed distributions can lead to wrong interpretations , unless the counting biases and stellar - dynamical evolution is treated systematically and consistently ; the basis of the argument being that newton s laws of motion can not be ignored . in a recent paper @xcite have supported the predictions made by @xcite concerning the binary population in the onc , by uncovering a radially dependent binary fraction in nice agreement with the theoretically expected behaviour .",
    "the late - type stellar binary population is therewith quite well understood , over the mass range between about 0.2  and 1.2  .",
    "the above work has also established the necessity to correctly dynamically model observed data in order to arrive at a consistent understanding of the physically relevant distribution functions .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) , which extend the mass scale down to 0.01  , have been added into the theoretical analysis in @xcite .",
    "this theoretical study of observational data @xcite showed that bds can not be understood to be an extension of the stellar mass regime ( as is often but wrongly stated ) .",
    "the hypothesis of doing so leads to incompatible statistics on the star - star , star - bd and bd - bd binary fractions , and on their energy distributions .",
    "this work showed that bds must be viewed as a separate population , and the theoretical suggestion by @xcite , that bds are ejected stellar embryos , is one likely explanation for this .",
    "in fact , their proposition logically implies different binary properties between stars and bds , because ejected objects can not have the same binding energies as not - ejected objects .",
    "likewise , the model of @xcite , according to which bds are born in the outer regions of massive accretion disks , implies them to have different pairing rules than stars .",
    "tk07 and this contribution are a logical extension of the above findings . here",
    "we repeat parts of the analysis of tk07 with assumed bd - like binary fractions up to 60  as an upper limit .",
    "the clusters we analyse are the onc ( @xcite ) , ta ( @xcite ) , ic  348 @xcite and the pleiades based on data by @xcite , @xcite and the prosser and stauffer open cluster database .",
    "the aim is to check whether our previous results are still valid for a higher binary fraction , and how robust they are for different accounting of unresolved binary masses .",
    "the imfs are constructed from power - law functions similar to that proposed by @xcite , @xmath1 or in bi - logarithmic form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalisation constant and @xmath4 . while salpeter found @xmath5 , the canonical stellar imf , @xmath6 ,",
    "is constructed as a two - part - power law after @xcite , with @xmath7 for a stellar mass @xmath8  and @xmath9 for higher masses .",
    "the substellar imf , @xmath10 , is taken to be a single power - law with cluster - dependent exponent @xmath11 .",
    "the basic assumption is that a large fraction of binaries remains unresolved since cluster surveys are often performed with wide - field surveys with limited resolution .",
    "one may be tempted to use the observed imf ( hereafter ) as a direct representation of the true imf of individual bodies ( simply the imf hereafter ) .",
    "however , the observed imf ( ) can differ largely from the imf , especially at the low - mass end of the population which contains most of the stellar companions .",
    "if the companion has a much lower mass than its primary , then its light does not contribute much to the combined luminosity and spectral type , and thus the derived mass is essentially that of the primary . if , however , both components have near - equal masses ( as expected from random pairing for very low primary masses ) , the low - mass region of the  may be depressed even further , since the combined luminosity can be up to twice the luminosity of the primary alone . therefore a fraction of unresolved low - mass binaries is counted as single stars , maybe even of higher mass , while their companions are omitted , attenuating the  at the lower mass end .",
    "possible approximations to the  are the system imf ( ) , that is the imf as a function of system mass ( see equations 6 to 8 in tk07 ) , and the primary body imf ( ) , the imf as a function of the primary object mass , @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total number of objects , @xmath15 is the minimum mass of an individual body in the given population , @xmath16 is the total binary fraction , and @xmath17 is the normalised individual - body imf .    in tk07",
    "the  has been used for the fitting process .",
    "however , one may argue that the mass derived from the system luminosity is closer to the mass of the primary star since the luminosity is mainly given by the primary object and the spectral features of the companion are outshone by those of the primary .",
    "therefore , the  has been used as the workhorse in the current contribution .    to obtain the true imf from an observed mass distribution a binary correction has to be applied to each native population ( i.e. a population of objects that share the same formation history ) the cluster consists of .",
    "this is done here via the semi - analytical backward - calculation method and @xmath18 minimisation against the observational data introduced in tk07 .",
    "it assumes two native populations with different imfs , different overall binary fractions and different mass - ratio distributions ( namely the two extreme cases of random pairing and equal - mass pairing for bds while random pairing is always applied to stars ) . for each cluster",
    "the bd imf slopes , the population ratio , @xmath19 and the upper mass limit of the bd - like imf , @xmath20 , are to be fitted , while the lower mass limit of bds ( 0.01  ) and of the star - like population ( 0.07  ) is kept constant . here , the number of bd - like and star - like objects is given by @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the imfs are then transformed into separate primary mass functions . before being compared to the observational mfs",
    "the fitted  has been smoothed by a gaussian convolution along the mass axis in order to simulate the error of the mass determination ( see tk07 for a more detailed description ) .",
    "this process is repeated iteratively until @xmath18 reaches a minimum .    for the pleiades",
    "the bd data do not constrain the power - law index , so fixed power - laws with @xmath22 ( the canonical value ) and @xmath23 have been used here .",
    "it should be noted that the power - law indices are in rough agreement with the power - law index @xmath24 deduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since they use bds and low - mass stars up to 0.48  while only bds and vlmss are used in our contribution these values have to be compared with caution .",
    "the crucial point in performing the binary correction is that the assumed number and mass range of a native population largely affects the resulting .",
    "if , for example , only one overall population is assumed ( as in the traditional star - like scenario for bds and stars ) but there are actually two separate bd - like and star - like populations with different mass ranges , then the binarity is corrected for wrongly at the lower mass end of the star - like population since a mixing of binary components between bds and stars is assumed that does not exist in reality .",
    "reversely , the observed ( primary ) imf of a cluster may appear as being continuous while actually consisting of two populations , because the discontinuity is masked by the interference of different probability densities of the populations in the transition or overlap region on the one hand and different binary fractions on the other , as well as being smeared out by measurement uncertainties .",
    "thus , an apparently continuous  or  may be related to a discontinuous imf or , more precisely , a composite imf which can only be revealed by reducing the fraction of unresolved binaries to insignificance by high - resolution observations .",
    "the magnitude of the discontinuity , measured as the number ratio of bd - like to star - like objects at the hydrogen - burning mass limit ( hbl ) , @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 if there is no overlap of the fitted bd - like and the star - like population ( which is actually the case for the onc and the pleiades ) , @xmath25 is calculated from extrapolation of the bd - like imf to the hbl . since @xmath25 depends on the binary fraction among each population , the binary fraction is varied from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in order to include even the most extreme bd binary fraction .",
    "the unresolved stellar binary fraction , @xmath29 , is set to 0.4 for the onc , ic  348 and the pleiades while that of ta is assumed to be 0.8 , as in tk07 .",

    "the assumed fraction of unresolved star - like binaries is @xmath32 . despite the high binary fraction in the lower panel the discontinuity near the stellar - substellar border",

    "similarly , the lower panel shows the trends with @xmath33 in the case of equal - mass pairing if the bd - like  is used for fitting .",
    "the most remarkable feature is that @xmath11 remains almost constant for equal - mass pairing in bd - like binaries . for random - pairing @xmath11 increases with @xmath33 in a similar way for all three clusters .",
    "a similar growth is found even for equal - mass pairing if  is used for fitting . for comparison ,",

    "[ fbd_a ] ( straight dashed lines at @xmath22 and @xmath39 ) .    the fitting of @xmath20 yields values slightly below 0.07  for the onc and the pleiades .",
    "this is probably due to the gaussian smearing of @xmath42 that has been used for smoothing the fit .",
    "for ta and ic  348 , however , @xmath20 is found to be around 0.1  and between 0.15 and 0.23  , respectively .",
    "furthermore , our results for the best - fit @xmath43 , the population ratio , and the magnitude of the discontinuity can be summarised as follows : for @xmath27 the best - fit @xmath43 is about 0.07 for the onc and the pleiades while it is about  0.15 for ta and ic  348 .",
    "it increases for larger @xmath33 , reaching about twice these values for the extreme binarity of @xmath28 .",
    "that is , if a realistic value of @xmath44 is assumed , we expect about  1 bd - like body per  10 star - like ones for the onc and the pleiades , and about  1 bd - like body per  5 star - like bodies for the others .",
    "this result is remarkable given that e.g. @xcite state a higher bd - to - star ratio for the onc than for ta and ic  348 .",
    "the result can be interpreted as a consequence of the large mass overlap of the bd - like and the star - like regime in ic  348 ( and a moderate overlap in ta ) , i.e. that many bd - like bodies are in actually very - low mass stars and thus are counted as normal stars .",
    "another issue is whether the substellar peak in the onc mf ( see the thin dashed histogram in fig .",
    "[ imf2tp ] ) is an artefact @xcite or a real feature . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath43 would be significantly higher ( about 75 , given the histogram data ) for the onc than suggested by our results .",
    "one may criticise the way of assigning a mass to an observed system . in tk07",
    "the model - observed imf has been created by simply adding the masses of all components , i.e. @xmath45 . because the observed data are being derived from luminosity functions rather than from mass functions , the correct way would be to convert luminosities into masses via the mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) .",
    "this would require rather complicated calculations because full - scale modelling would involve age - spreads and age - dependent mlrs with very significant uncertainties @xcite .",
    "instead , a simpler way to at least embrace the real relation is to repeat the analysis ( or parts of it ) by using the primary mass instead of the system mass .",
    "this corresponds to the extreme case that the contribution of less - massive companions is negligible .",
    "this method has been used in the present contribution with similar results as in tk07 . in addition",

    "a discontinuity in the imf near the hydrogen burning mass limit appears if the binary properties of bds and vlmss on the one hand , and of stars on the other , are taken into account carefully when inferring the true underlying single - object imf .",
    "this implies that bds and some vlmss need to be viewed as arising from a somewhat different formation channel than the stellar formation channel , but this result has been obtained by tk07 under the assumption that bds have a binary fraction of only  15 .",
