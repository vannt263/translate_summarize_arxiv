    "the interest for a fundamental understanding of strongly correlated systems has led to the development of a number of electronic structure methods . among the most successful are the lda+@xmath0 approach proposed by anisimov and coworkers @xcite and the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) proposed by georges and coworkers @xcite . very recently a new scheme , dubbed the lda+gutzwiller method @xcite , for treating strong electron correlations was introduced . in all these methods the strong coulomb onsite correlations for electrons residing in the localized orbitals are explicitly taken care of via a set of hubbard like _ parameters _ or the hubbard _",
    "u_. this is evidently unsatisfactory from the point of view of quantitative prediction of materials properties , since optical and magnetic excitations are of vital importance in many technological applications such as solar cell design , optical memories , photo luminescent devices ( semiconductor lasers and diodes ) and photo chemical reactions .",
    "often it has been shown that by adjusting the hubbard @xmath0 one can get results in good agreement with experiment but not for a good reason .",
    "hereby lies the importance of determining @xmath0 entirely from first - principles .    over the last two decades",
    "a number of methods for calculating the hubbard _ u _ from first principles have been proposed .",
    "the pioneering work may be traced back to the paper by gunnarsson _",
    "@xcite who proposed to calculate _",
    "u _ using the constrained lda ( clda ) scheme .",
    "a few years ago , a new method for calculating the hubbard _ u _ , named the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa ) method in analogy to the clda  method , was proposed @xcite .",
    "the method allows for a systematic and precise determination of the hubbard _ u _ entirely from first - principles from the knowledge of the bandstructure alone .",
    "the method was based on the intuitive idea that the hubbard _ u _ can be viewed as a coulomb interaction screened by the polarization of the whole system excluding the polarization arising from a set of bands which are treated in the hubbard model . in other words ,",
    "the hubbard _ u _ when further screened by the electrons in the hubbard model yields the screened interaction of the full system .",
    "this intuitive idea was recently shown to be rigorously correct and the crpa is just an approximate way of calculating the screened interaction _ u _ within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .    by determining the hubbard _ u _ from first - principles the crpa method offers the possibility of making methods based on the hubbard _ u _ fully first - principles schemes .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to develop a scheme for calculating the electronic structure of correlated materials based on a truly _ self - consistent _ _ first - principles _",
    "lda+@xmath0 scheme . in conventional lda+@xmath0 scheme as it was originally proposed @xcite , the hubbard @xmath0 is taken as an adjustable parameter which is fixed for a given calculation . in our proposed self - consistent lda+@xmath0 scheme , we calculate the lda+@xmath0 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and use these to calculate @xmath0 using the crpa method . the new @xmath0",
    "is then used in the next iteration to obtain a new set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and the iteration is continued until convergence is achieved .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is no longer an arbitrarily adjusted parameter like in the original lda+@xmath0 scheme but rather it is determined self - consistently within the theoretical scheme .",
    "our first target will be to calculate the electronic structure of the transition metal oxide series and as a test case we consider nio , which is regarded as the epitome of mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "we are also aiming at obtaining a more satisfactory description of the electronic structure of the @xmath4 electron series which is highly problematic for the lda .",
    "the path is then opened for more complex materials , such as magnetic semiconductors , for which no realistic methods are in existent at present .    in the present paper we present some results for nio and gd , which we believe should provide us with a stringent test of the applicability of our method .",
    "the most important finding is that our numerical approach is indeed stable i.e it is possible to find @xmath0 and @xmath5 self - consistently .",
    "the bandgap in nio and the spin - splitting of the @xmath2-bands in gd are found to compare well with experiment using our self - consistent determined values of the correlation parameters .",
    "we first give a short summary of the crpa method presented in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the fully screened coulomb interaction is given by @xmath6^{-1}v\\ ] ] where _ v _ is the bare coulomb interaction and _ p _ is the non - interacting polarization given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are one - particle bloch eigenfunctions and eigenvalues corresponding to the system s band structure .",
    "for systems with a narrow @xmath9 or @xmath4 band crossing the fermi level , typical of strongly correlated materials , we may divide the polarization into @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 includes merely the transitions within the narrow band ( @xmath9-@xmath9 _ or _ @xmath4-@xmath4 transitions ) and @xmath12 be the rest of the polarization , which includes transitions from the 3d band to the rest of the bands and vice - versa .",
    "it was noticed that the following quantity can be interpreted as the effective interaction among electrons living in the narrow band ( hubbard _ u ) _ : @xmath13^{-1}v \\label{wr}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 can be related to the fully screened interaction _ w _ by the following _ identity : _ @xmath14^{-1}u . \\label{w}\\ ] ] this identity explicitly shows that the interaction between the @xmath9 or @xmath4 electrons is given by a frequency - dependent interaction @xmath0 . thus the remaining screening channels in the hubbard model associated with the localized @xmath15 electrons , represented by the @xmath15-@xmath15 polarization @xmath16 further screen @xmath0 to give the fully screened interaction @xmath17 .",
    "we refer the method of calculating the hubbard _ u _ according to ( [ wr ] ) as crpa because we have constrained the polarization to exclude transitions within the narrow band ( @xmath15-@xmath15 transitions ) .",
    "although the formula in ( [ wr ] ) has been obtained within the rpa , the result is actually exact provided @xmath12 is exact , as was shown recently @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we retain only the local components of the effective interaction on the same atomic site by taking the following matrix element : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20 lmto @xcite orbital ( @xmath9 or @xmath4 ) centered on an atomic site and the interaction @xmath21 is the static ( @xmath22 value of eq .",
    "( [ wr ] ) . in calculating _",
    "u _ we have approximated @xmath19 by the `` head '' of the lmto , i.e. , the solution to the schrdinger equation inside the atomic sphere .",
    "this is expected to be a reasonable approximation because the @xmath23 states are rather localized .",
    "lmto is just one possible choice for the one - particle orbitals but other choices are perfectly legitimate .",
    "for example , the newly developed nmto ( where n is the number of energies chosen to span the region of interest ) @xcite and the recently proposed maximally localized wannier orbitals @xcite are possible choices .",
    "it is worth noting that the _ u _ entering the hubbard model will inevitably depend on the choice of the one - particle basis @xmath19 defining the annihilation and creation operators , no matter what method we use to calculate @xmath21 , which is independent of the basis functions used in the band structure method .      in the spirit of the lda+@xmath0 approach@xcite",
    ", we introduce an orbital - dependent exchange - correlation operator @xmath24 acting among a localized set of electrons .",
    "the lmto head is in general denoted by site index @xmath25 , angular quantum number @xmath26 and spin @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to the usual single - particle lda hamiltonian , we include appropriate matrix - elements of @xmath28 . in the tb - representation@xcite",
    "we get @xmath29 with @xmath30 we have used @xmath31 , an assumption which is confirmed numerically .",
    "further , the diagonal overlap matrix @xmath32 as well as the hamiltonian matrix @xmath33 are given in @xcite .",
    "consider next @xmath34 . assuming a spin - independent hubbard @xmath0 , and a diagonal spin - density matrix @xmath35@xcite we obtain : @xmath36 now @xmath37 is substantial for all @xmath38 in contrast to @xmath39 which is rather small , except when @xmath40 .",
    "we shall use @xmath41 independent of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 which result in the simple form @xmath45,\\ ] ] where the double counting term suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite has been added . for a fixed value of @xmath0 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the matrix - elements are evaluated and added to the lmto - hamiltonian prior to diagonalization .",
    "the density - matrix @xmath46 is updated every iteration using the eigenvectors as well as the overlap matrix .",
    "the corresponding term , which has to be added to the total energy functional , is given by @xmath47\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "it should be noted that already the simple form of the non - local potential gives rise to upper and lower hubbard bands with an energy separation given by @xmath49 .",
    "the crpa method requires as input eigenfunctions and eigenvalues ( fixed during the calculation ) and delivers as output the hubbard @xmath0 matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "the lda+@xmath0 method needs a @xmath0-matrix ( fixed during the calculation ) as input and gives as output eigenfunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "the main point of the present work is to merge these two schemes in a selfconsistent way .",
    "we summarize the iterative steps :    \\1 .",
    "firstly we do a normal crpa calculation @xcite in order to achieve the initial hubbard @xmath0 matrix ( iteration one ; matrix @xmath50 ) to be used in the lda+@xmath0 calculation .",
    "2 . after the lda+@xmath0 calculation has converged we save the output lda+@xmath0 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and use these to calculate @xmath0 within crpa ( eqs .",
    "( [ p],[wr],[u ] ) ) , in order to find the updated @xmath0-matrix for the next lda+@xmath0 calculation ( iteration two ; matrix @xmath51 ) .",
    "the procedure is continued until the @xmath0-matrix is stable i.e after @xmath52 iterations we have @xmath53 .",
    "the size of the @xmath0-matrix is rather large , however many elements are related by symmetry .",
    "all the results presented in this paper used the simple form of the non - local potential , because a substantial number of tests have shown that more elaborate forms of the potential do not influence the final results .",
    "the most important finding in the present work is indeed the possibility to converge the @xmath0-matrix within the defined self - consistency cycle . in all cases",
    "studied convergency is reached within a reasonable number of iterations .    to illustrate the applicability of the present scheme to real materials we have applied the scheme to nio , which is an epitome of the charge transfer insulators , and gd .",
    "these two systems have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the nio lda band gap is known to be too small and likewise the lda exchange splitting in @xmath4 gd is too small .",
    "these provide a motivation for improving upon the lda .    a summary of some results for our prototype systems : for nio , the self - consistent determined values @xmath54 ev and @xmath55 ev , improves the bandgap ( 2.5 ev ) , compared with conventional lda , though too small in comparison with experiment ( 4 ev ) .",
    "the exchange spin - splitting of the @xmath2-bands in gd are found to compare rather well with experiment ( @xmath56 ev ) using our self - consistent determined values of @xmath57 ev and @xmath58 ev .",
    "we have also calculated the gd ( nio ) magnetic moment to be @xmath59 ( 1.5 ) , which is comparable to the experimental value @xmath60@xcite ( 1.6 - 1.9 @xmath61 ) , and an improvement compared to lda .",
    "we first discuss gd , where the lda+@xmath0 bandstructure corresponding to the self - consistent values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 are displayed in figs .",
    "( [ fig : gd - up]-[fig : gd - do ] ) . the majority ( spin up ) @xmath2 bands",
    "are centred around -11 ev and the minority ones around 3 ev .",
    "the occupied spin up bands are very narrow due to shielding by the @xmath62 and @xmath63 electrons , due to the hybridization with other bands the unoccupied minority bands display some dispersion , making it difficult to extract the exchange splitting .",
    "however , we estimate that our calculated exchange splitting at convergency is somewhat too large by say @xmath64 ev .    we note that our parameters differs significantly from those previously used in literature .",
    "_ et al__@xcite found @xmath65 ev and @xmath66 ev using a supercell approach .",
    "the experimental gap ( splitting between the pes and bis main - peaks ) is given by @xmath67 , which from purely atomic considerations is predicted to be @xmath68 , using @xmath69 spin - up electrons in the groundstate ( gs ) .",
    "with the parameters of harmon _ _ et al.__@xcite , an underestimation is obtained , resulting in a splitting of 11 ev . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the 4f states no longer form a narrow atomic - like band but hybridized with other states in the same energy range . thus ,",
    "the atomic picture used to estimate the exchange splitting may not be valid anymore .",
    "the frequency - dependent @xmath0 @xcite from the normal crpa calculation , i.e. , from calculation starting from the lda bandstructure , is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : uw - gd ] ) .",
    "we note the dramatic change in @xmath0 for small energies , shooting up to the self - consistent value of @xmath0 already within 2 ev .",
    "in fact , the frequency dependence would have become even stronger if we had not used a life - time broadening when calculating the response function . using a tetrahedral method for the brillouin zone integration without a life - time broadening would probably result in a decrease in @xmath0 from its zero - energy value before it shoots up to a large value at around 1.5 ev .",
    "this behavior is in contrast to the transition - metals studied earlier@xcite . towards self - consistency",
    "we noticed a significant change in @xmath0 already in the second crpa calculation ( 1 iteration ) ; @xmath0 is in fact enhanced for small energies giving rise to a quite smooth curve with weak dependency on frequency .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : uw - gd ] ) , the frequency dependence of @xmath0 is indeed much weaker after self - consistency , with a relatively constant value of @xmath70 ev in the frequency range around 5 ev .",
    "the weakening of the energy dependence of _ u _ for small energies may be explained by the increase in the exchange splitting of the up and down @xmath4 states . as the occupied @xmath4 states are pushed down the excitation energies from the occupied @xmath4 states to unoccupied states",
    "similarly , as the unoccupied @xmath4 states are pushed up , the excitation energies from occupied states to the unoccupied @xmath4 states increase .",
    "thus , the peak structure in the imaginary part of the screened interaction arising from these excitations is shifted to higher energy . through the kramers - kronig relation",
    "this results in much smoother behavior of _ u _ at low energy .",
    "this result is very encouraging since it gives justification for using a static value of _",
    "u_.    finally we consider nio , where the lda+@xmath0 bandstructure corresponding to the self - consistent values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nio - band ] ) . for this system clda calculations yields",
    "@xmath71 ev and @xmath72 ev @xcite , which is comparable to our self - consistent values of @xmath0 = 6.6 ev and @xmath5 = 0.9 ev .",
    "the gap obtained using the clda parameters is 3 ev@xcite , compared to the experimenal gap of 4 ev@xcite .",
    "the difference between our and the clda @xmath0 ( 1.4 ev ) is reflected in our decreased bandgap of 2.5 ev .",
    "[ c]llll & @xmath0 ( ev ) & @xmath5 ( ev ) & magnetic moment ( @xmath73 ) + nio & 6.6 ( 8.0 @xcite ) & 0.9 ( 1.0 @xcite ) & 1.5 ( 1.6 - 1.9 @xcite ) + gd & 12.4 ( 6.7 @xcite ) & 1.0 ( 0.7 @xcite ) & 7.8 ( 7.6 @xcite ) +    [ tab : i ]    as in the case of gd , the hubbard _ u _ as a function of frequency undergoes a significant change as self - consistency is achieved .",
    "starting from the lda bandstructure , the resulting _ u _ calculated using the crpa method exhibits a strong energy dependence at low energy . as the band gap increases ,",
    "the energy dependence of _ u _ at low energy becomes smoother .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is similar to the case of gd , namely , as the gap increases the peak structure in the imaginary part of the screened interaction is shifted to higher energy , and through the kramers - kronig relation , it results in a smooth behavior of _ u _ at low energy .",
    "the too large 4@xmath2 separation obtained in the self - consistent lda+@xmath0 scheme may arise from a shortcoming of the lda+__u _ _ scheme itself rather than in the rpa used in calculating _",
    "u_. a similar problem is also observed in the so - called quasiparticle self - consistent gw ( qsgw ) scheme @xcite .",
    "as the 4@xmath2 separation becomes larger , the screening associated with the 4@xmath2 bands becomes weaker , which leads to a larger @xmath0 .",
    "this in turns tends to decrease the screening strength and so forth .",
    "this indicates a shortcoming of the theory , namely , the absence of energy - dependent self - energy and the vertex correction , the latter is also left out in the qsgw schemes .    a further problem that plagues the lda+@xmath0 scheme is the double - counting problem .",
    "this problem becomes apparent when the relative position of the correlated bands with respect to other bands is important .",
    "this relative position is rather sensitive to the double - counting formula used in the scheme .",
    "we believe this double - counting problem is responsible for the incorrect positioning of the 4@xmath2 bands in ce as well as the 3@xmath15 bands in nio , giving a too small band gap in the latter , which has also been found in other works @xcite . while the separation between the unoccupied @xmath74 and occupied @xmath75 bands of nickel is reasonably well reproduced , the relative position of these 3@xmath15 bands with respect to the oxygen 2@xmath76 bands is presumably incorrect . in the case of the transition metal oxides , such as nio , the band gap is formed between the unoccopied ni @xmath74 band and the occupied o 2@xmath76 band .",
    "we have developed a new self - consistent lda+@xmath0 scheme , in which the important parameter _",
    "u _ is determined self - consistency using the crpa method . as test cases we have considered nio and gd and",
    "it is shown that the scheme does yield converged results .",
    "the exchange splitting in gd has been found to be too large by 1 - 2 ev whereas the band gap in nio has been found to be too small , 2.5 ev compared with the experimental value of about 4.0 ev .",
    "an interesting finding is that the energy dependence of _ u _ at low energy is found to be much smoother after self - consistency compared with the result obtained from the lda bandstructure .",
    "this provides justification for using a static value of _",
    "u_. our results indicate some short - comings of the lda+__u _ _ scheme , in particular the incorrect positioning of the 4f states in gd and the 3d states in nio points to a problem with the double - counting term . investigating different forms of the double - counting term within the newly developed self - consistent lda+__u",
    "_ _ scheme could be a fruitful direction to pursue in the future .",
