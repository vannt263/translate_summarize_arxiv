    "<S> extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) line emission of impurities has attracted less attention than the x - ray lines , in part because the flux of emitted photons in the euv region is typically smaller due to lower transition probabilities . </S>",

    "<S> for instance , for the highest nominal beam energy of e@xmath49 = 25 kev , the best - fit theoretical energy was only 10.5 kev , while for e@xmath49 = 8.8 kev the fit energy was about 6.2 kev . </S>",
    "<S> although space - charge effects in the trap may effectively reduce the beam energy , for the present values of the nominal voltage and beam current this would result in a less than 300 ev shift .    </S>",
    "<S> calculation of ionization balance in an ebit plasma was a subject of several studies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> each ion is normally modelled as one state with no internal structure , and approximate formulas , such as lotz formula for ionization cross sections , are used for description of atomic processes . in constrast , our collisional - radiative modelling emphasizes the atomic physics component of simulations by implementing detailed descriptions of charge stages ( about 1000 levels per ion ) and relevant physical processes affecting populations of atomic levels . </S>",
    "<S> this is a necessary condition for the accurate modelling of well - resolved ebit spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the relative line intensities _ within _ a particular ionization stage are only weakly sensitive to variations in the ebit beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the observed disagreement with the simulations is most likely due to modification of the ionization distribution in the ebit plasma . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be explained by charge exchange ( cx ) with neutral particles ( mostly nitrogen and oxygen ) that are always present in the trap . </S>",
    "<S> first , note that the only important electron - ion recombination process in the ebit is the radiative recombination . </S>",
    "<S> dielectronic recombination ( dr ) would generally be very important for the high ion charges in question ; however , it is an energy - selective process , and for all cases considered here the electron beam energy is outside the range of importance for dr . </S>",
    "<S> our present calculations show that the typical radiative recombination cross sections for the relevant ions of tungsten are on the order of 10@xmath50 cm@xmath19 ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the cx cross sections are normally much larger . </S>",
    "<S> the classical trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) theory @xcite gives the approximate dependence as :    @xmath52    and thus for 60 to 70 times ionized atoms the cx cross section is close to 10@xmath53 cm@xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple formula agrees within 40% with the semiempirical scaling law for charge exchange @xcite that is often used in charge distribution simulations of ebit plasmas .    </S>",
    "<S> the cx rate depends on the density of the neutrals @xmath54 , relative velocity of neutrals and tungsten ions @xmath55 , and the cross section @xmath56 . for simplicity , the product @xmath57 , averaged over the relative energy distribution of neutrals and w ions , can be replaced by the product of @xmath56 and effective averaged velocity @xmath58 , so that the cx rate becomes @xmath59 . both @xmath54 and @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> are unknown parameters that may actually vary from measurement to measurement . </S>",
    "<S> ( a slight enhancement of lower ionization stages at @xmath7 = 9.0 kev vs. @xmath7 = 8.8 kev may be due to this uncertainty . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , since they enter only as a product , one can use this single parameter to fit the ionization balance . as there exist no calculations of cx for such highly - charged ions </S>",
    "<S> , we used the cx cross section of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigcx ] ) and varied the @xmath60 product to reach agreement with experimental spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the example of correspondence for the most complex spectrum at @xmath7 = 8.8 kev is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sim ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the calculated spectrum that uses only one fit parameter ( the theoretical beam energy was fixed at 8.8 kev ) correctly reproduces relative intensities for practically all observed lines . </S>",
    "<S> the derived value of @xmath61 @xmath62 4@xmath1010@xmath63 @xmath64s@xmath18 is consistent with general estimates for @xmath54 and @xmath58 expected inside the ebit . </S>",

    "<S> thus , dependence on @xmath9 is effectively removed from the modelling .    at the lowest energies @xmath7 = 8.8 kev and 9.0 kev ( see figure [ exper ] ) , one can clearly identify two groups of strong lines , namely , in the range of 4 nm to 8 nm and 14.5 nm to 17.5 nm . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath81  @xmath83 transition in w@xmath24 , and their value of @xmath66 = 15.959 nm is within the experimental uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength of the 3s@xmath19 @xmath76 - 3s3p @xmath77 transition in mg - like w@xmath48 was calculated at @xmath66 = 8.0509 nm using the relativistic model - potential method @xcite , compared to our measured value of 7.991(2 ) nm . among the recent calculations for the 3s@xmath46 - 3p@xmath46 transition in the na - like ion , </S>",
    "<S> the mcdf @xcite and many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) @xcite results should be mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> the latter give a wavelength @xmath66 = 7.7659 nm in very good agreement with the present experiment , and the mbpt transition probability a = 4.296 @xmath10 10@xmath43 s@xmath18 agrees with our calculations within 2  % . </S>",
    "<S> the ab initio mcdf wavelength of seely @xcite @xmath66 = 7.7479 nm is also close to the measured value , while baik s result of @xmath66 = 7.8184 nm @xcite is higher by 0.05 nm . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the wavelength predicted in @xcite by extrapolation along isoelectronic sequence , @xmath66 = 7.7661 nm , agrees well with the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the low electron density in the ebit , two to three orders of magnitude lower than that in typical tokamaks , allows one to observe weak spectral lines that might be collisionally quenched in fusion reactors . </S>",
    "<S> a recently discussed example is provided by the magnetic - octupole line in the ni - like w@xmath84 @xcite , with a radiative transition probability on the order of @xmath85 s@xmath18 , that becomes quenched at densities above 10@xmath86 @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> . the higher degree of ionization for the lines considered here should be more favorable for their survival as the most important @xmath13=0 collisional cross sections decrease with an increase of ion charge . to test this assumption , we used the nomad code to solve the steady - state system of rate equations for approximately 6000 levels of the ions w@xmath0 through w@xmath8 at an electron temperature @xmath3 = 10@xmath38 ev and density @xmath9 = 10@xmath87 @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that for all lines in table [ table1 ] , including the weakest lines with transition probabilities a @xmath6 10@xmath23  s@xmath18 , the radiative decays are still the dominant depopulation process for the upper levels of corresponding transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this result remains valid for a large range of electron temperatures since the typical energy difference for collisional processes is much smaller than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these lines will not be collisionally quenched in the iter plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we presented here the first measurements of euv spectra from highly - charged ( @xmath4 = 54 to 63 ) ions of w that are important for plasma diagnostics in iter - class fusion reactors . using advanced collisional - radiative modelling of line spectra from the non - maxwellian plasma of ebit </S>",
    "<S> , we identified 26 new electric - dipole and magnetic - dipole lines from 10 consecutive ionization stages w@xmath0 through w@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also measured wavelengths of three important spectral lines for al- , mg- , and na - like ions of hf , ta , and au and used them to confirm our identifications of corresponding lines in w. these prominent lines may be used as tracer identifications in the iter plasma interior . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing importance of charge exchange for ionization balance of high - z ions in the ebit plasmas was pointed out as well . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the modelling and a discussion of various spectral features will be provided elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> this research was performed while one of us ( i.n.d . ) </S>",
