    "the dense and warm circumstellar material at scales of 200  au ( as traced by the 1.35  mm dust continuum emission ) is about ten times more massive in vla  3 than in vla  2 ( @xmath10.25 and @xmath10.023  m@xmath86 , respectively ; table  [ t1 ] ) .",

    "the stellar mass for vla  2 is even more uncertain since the bolometric luminosity is unknown . yet",
    ", its 11.8  @xmath79 m flux is @xmath12.5 weaker than that of vla  3 @xcite , which suggests that vla  2 is also an intermediate mass star .",
    "in fact , from the observed centimetre continuum emission of vla 2 , @xcite infer a bolometric luminosity of @xmath150  l@xmath86 for this object which can be provided by a protostar of a few solar masses .",
    "an educated guess of the mass can be also done by comparing the velocity range of the emission for vla  2 and vla  3 : at 2-@xmath24 level the emission spreads out @xmath120 and 12  km  s@xmath4  for vla  3 and vla  2 , respectively ( see section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "if the kinematics is dominated by keplerian motions ( although with the present data we can not discard the possibility that the motions around vla  3 are just due to an overlapping of unbound motions of two independent sources , vla  3a and vla  3b ) , then the mass ratio between the two sources would be @xmath87 , where the subindices 2 and 3 refer to vla 2 and vla 3 . assuming that the radius of emission , @xmath88 , is approximately the same for the two sources ( see section [ t3 ] ) , then the vla 2 mass is roughly 40% smaller than the vla  3 , @xmath12 - 4  m@xmath89 .",

    "the sio 5 - 4 emission appears to originate from two different types of regions .",
    "first , there is a low radial velocity ( @xmath17  km  s@xmath4 ) bipolar outflow in the northeast - southwest direction arising from vla  2 .",
    "[ fig - sio ] shows that the sio is relatively compact ( @xmath14  arcsec , @xmath14000  au ) , specially in the blueshifted lobe and , more importantly , it is contained within the dense molecular gas structure traced by the h@xmath5co  @xmath90-@xmath91 line .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.2.1 , the relatively low radial velocities , with the northern blueshifted lobe also having weak redshifted emission , suggest that the outflow is close to the plane of the sky",
    ". there is also redhsifted sio emission @xmath14  arcsec south of vla  3 .",
    "if this emission is associated with the sio bipolar outflow , then it would imply that the redshifted lobe has suffered a deflection of @xmath150@xmath43 .",
    "we identify the bipolar molecular outflow seen in sio as the `` extended '' outflow counterpart of the very compact ( @xmath10.2  arcsec ,",
    "@xmath1180  au ) , short - lived ( kinematic age @xmath140  yr ) , episodic , bipolar outflow observed through h@xmath5o maser proper motions also expanding close to the plane of the sky in the northeast - southwest direction with velocities of @xmath120  km  s@xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig - sio ] ) .",
    "in fact , from the proper motions and radial velocities of the h@xmath5o masers reported by torrelles et al .",
    "( 2014 ) we estimate that the outflow axis has an inclination angle of @xmath115@xmath50 with respect to the plane of the sky . from the observed spatial extension and radial velocity of the sio bipolar outflow",
    ", we estimate a kinematic age of @xmath1350  yr for this outflow ( after correcting for the inclination angle of @xmath115@xmath50 ) .",
    "we therefore propose that this more extended and `` older '' outflow seen in sio has been created by the accumulation of the ejection of several episodic collimated events of material as the one observed through the h@xmath5o masers .",
    "we note , however , that the position angle of the sio bipolar outflow is @xmath1206@xmath50 , while the position angle of the very compact h@xmath5o maser outflow is @xmath1247@xmath50   @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this difference in position angles of @xmath140@xmath50   between the extended sio outflow and the compact h@xmath5o maser outflow is due to several short - lived episodic ejection events , which would have slightly different position angles at their origin .",

    "the wedge on the top indicates the velocity range ( in  km  s@xmath4 ) of the three panels .",
    ", width=302 ]      the other type of emission traced by sio arises at the systemic velocity of the core ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "the sio emission is a signpost of strong shocks , since it can be generated after sputtering in shocks of the si locked in the dust grains @xcite .",
    "however , in other star - forming regions sio is detected at velocities close to the systemic velocity of the cloud , with relatively narrow line widths and with no obvious association with the protostellar outflow activity @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that , in these cases , the sio can be produced in low velocity shocks ( @xmath96  km  s@xmath4 ) if about 10% of the si is already in the gas phase or in the icy mantles @xcite .",
    "although this can explain the sio emission at velocities close to the systemic velocity of the core , it is unclear what would be the origin of the initial si abundance outside of the dust grains .",
    "sio emission at velocities close to the systemic velocity of the cloud is detected both in vla 2 and in the bridge of molecular emission connecting vla  2 and vla  3 ( hereafter `` vla  32 bridge '' ; see fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "thus , we think that this sio emission is probably due to the interaction ( resulting in low velocity shocks ) , either between the vla 2 and vla 3 circumstellar gas , or between the vla 2 circumstellar gas and the dust ridge gas that surrounds the two circumstellar structures .",
    "this latter case is less probable , since the vla  32 bridge shows emission from hot core - like molecular lines that are also present in vla  2 and vla  3 , but not in the dust ridge .",
    "therefore , we favour a kinematical scenario with a stream of gas between vla  3 and vla  2 , producing shocks and releasing sio . however , with the present data we can not discern the direction of the stream of gas ( either from vla  3 to vla  2 or from vla  2 to vla  3 ) , particularly considering that vla  3 is a binary source where we are not able to resolve the kinematics and spatial distribution of the gas contents of each component ( 3a and 3b )",
    "nevertheless , if the stream of gas is from vla  3 to vla  2 , this scenario would increase the accretion rate onto vla  2 , and could explain why this protostar has a high outflow activity .",

    "the outflow activity detected in this region is diverse , but all the signposts indicate that there is a preferential direction of the various outflow axes @xcite . besides the aforementioned h@xmath5o maser and sio outflows associated with vla  2 , vla  3a and vla  3b are radio jets with position angles of @xmath155@xmath50  and @xmath157@xmath50 , respectively @xcite .",
    "vla  1 is also a radio jet with a position angle of @xmath145@xmath50  @xcite .",
    "there is a large scale ( @xmath11  pc ) ne - sw co bipolar outflow , with the ne red lobe being more extended and brighter than the sw blue lobe @xcite .",
    "interestingly , and in spite of having a similar orientation as the sio bipolar outflow ( this paper ) , the co outflow has an inverted velocity pattern , suggesting a different powering source .",

    "recently , @xcite have detected a very high velocity blueshifted [ feii ] knot , a few arcseconds south of vla  3 , which appears to be associated with the vla  3b radio jet .",
    "finally , @xcite detect a chain of hh objects , hh 815 - 822 , centred around the lkh@xmath0  234  region , with an outflow axis at pa@xmath9760@xmath50/240@xmath50   and extending @xmath16  pc .",

    "[ fig - cont - out ] shows the dust emission traced by our sma observations with the directions of the outflows identified in the region .",
    "it is clear that the overall trend of the activity of the outflows occurs in a direction that is approximately perpendicular to the dust ridge .",
    "we think that a magnetic field perpendicular to the dust ridge could produce the general alignment of the different outflows in the region .",
    "although in general there is not a clear correlation between the magnetic field and the outflow direction at core scales , @xmath98  au @xcite , there are some cases where they are aligned @xcite .",
    "this can be tested with dust polarisation measurements along the dust ridge .",
    "the most evolved source , lkh@xmath0  234 , is located at the south - eastern edge of the dust ridge , whereas the two apparently youngest sources , mm  1 and vla  1 , are located at the opposite side of the dust ridge .",
    "our estimate of these sources being the youngest is based on two main facts .",
    "first , they are not detected at mid - ir or shorter wavelengths .",
    "second , the circumstellar gas is as dense and massive as in vla 2 and vla 3 , but it is significantly colder ( there is no indication of hot core tracers as in vla  2 and vla  3 ) .",
    "therefore , these properties suggest an overall evolutionary sequence along the dust ridge , where star formation started in the southeastern part of the dust ridge and has proceeded with time toward the northwest .",
    "we speculate that a compression wave has continued toward the northwest extreme , once the star formation started in lkh@xmath0  234 .",
    "this , together with the fact that the outflow activity occurs in a direction perpendicular to the dust ridge suggests that the present star formation activity in the region around lkh@xmath0  234   is taking place in an organised fashion .",
    "we report sma 1.35  mm continuum and spectral line observations ( angular resolution @xmath10.5 - 0.8  arcsec ) towards the intermediate - mass star - forming region around the optically visible star lkh@xmath0  234 .",
    "we have detected a dust ridge of @xmath15  arcsec ( @xmath14500  au ) size containing the cluster of ysos vla  1 , vla  2 , vla  3a , vla  3b , and mm1 .",
    "the mass of the dust ridge is @xmath17  m@xmath89 while the circumstellar masses around these ysos are in the range of @xmath10.020.3  m@xmath89 .",
    "we find an evolutionary star formation sequence along the dust ridge , with the most evolved objects located at the southeastern edge of the ridge and the youngest ones located at the northeastern edge .",
    "the outflow activity of the different ysos in the region occurs approximately perpendicular to the dust ridge .",
    "this overall trend of orientation of the outflows could be explained by the presence of a ",
    "large - scale \" magnetic field perpendicular to the dust ridge .",
    "our sma observations reveal towards vla  2 , a compact ( @xmath14  arcsec , @xmath14000  au ) , sio bipolar outflow , moving close to the plane of the sky in the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "the kinematic age of the sio outflow is @xmath1350  yr .",

    "there is a bridge of molecular gas connecting vla  3 and vla  2 having sio emission at ambient velocities .",
