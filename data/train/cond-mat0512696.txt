    "much attention has been focused on the occurrence of superconductivity in na@xmath0coo@xmath14h@xmath1o .",

    "@xcite the low temperature scale and the kadowaki - woods ratio are strongly field dependent with the system becoming more weakly correlated with increasing field .    interestingly , some of the above properties are reminiscent of the predictions of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of the hubbard model.@xcite at half filling ( @xmath26 ) dmft predicts a mott metal - insulator transition for @xmath27 . in the metallic phase close to the mott transition",

    "electrons behave as quasi - localized moments which leads to a curie - weiss behavior of the magnetic susceptibility . @xcite",
    "the above discussion suggests that dmft , which treats the local electronic correlations exactly , may capture the relevant physics needed to describe the temperature dependence of many of the transport and magnetic properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "an important first step in studying the properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is to consider the two - dimensional triangular lattice hubbard model .",
    "this is motivated by the arrangement of the co atoms and because correlation effects can be singled out and better understood in the simplest model .",
    "related models such as the @xmath29 model on the triangular lattice have been recently analyzed using resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory.@xcite the implicit assumption in this kind of approach is that many important aspects of more realistic models for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 are already contained in the simpler triangular lattice model .",
    "our present study , however , leads to the important conclusion that a single band hubbard model on a triangular lattice is not enough to describe the magnetic and electronic properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 and a more realistic model is proposed .",
    "our main finding , summarized in fig .",

    "we find that in the electron doped triangular lattice a curie - weiss metal and metallic ferromagnetism arise when only local coulomb correlations are taken into account .",
    "the curie ",

    ", the local magnetic susceptibility smoothly changes from the curie form characteristic of local moments at high temperature to fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the fermi energy . in the curie - weiss metal",
    "the uniform susceptibility is strongly enhanced by both band narrowing due to correlations and the proximity to the ferromagnetic instability .",
    "in contrast , the electron doped triangular hubbard model with @xmath2 and @xmath35 displays pauli paramagnetism weakly enhanced by the coulomb repulsion ; a behavior typical of weakly correlated metals .",
    "thus our analysis shows how the non - interacting dispersion has a dramatic effect on the electronic and magnetic properties of a frustrated hubbard model .",

    "for @xmath43 the above model gives a tight - binding dispersion @xmath44 with bandwidth @xmath45 .",
    "for the hubbard model on the square lattice at half filling , the ground state is believed to be a mott insulator with nel order for all values of @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that this occurs even for arbitrarily small @xmath46 is due to the perfect nesting of the non - interacting fermi surface at half filling .",
    "in contrast , the triangular lattice may exhibit diverse phases as @xmath46 is varied .",
    "possible ground states that have been proposed include the mott insulator , commensurate non - collinear antiferromagnetism , incommensurate spin - density wave ( both metallic and insulating ) , spin liquid , superconducting , and metallic states .    in the strong correlation limit , @xmath47",

    "numerical calculations from a range of techniques including exact diagonalisation,@xcite variational quantum monte carlo,@xcite coupled cluster methods,@xcite and series expansions@xcite suggest that this has a magnetically ordered ground state in which neighbouring spins are rotated by 120 degrees relative to one another , as in the classical ground state .",
    "this agrees with the predictions of spin wave theory.@xcite however , series expansions calculations suggest that the excitation spectrum is qualitatively different from that predicted by non - linear spin wave theory.@xcite    at half - filling there is no nesting of the non - interacting fermi surface and so for small @xmath46 a metallic state is possible .",
    "exact diagonalisation calculations of the drude weight for lattices with 12 sites suggest that there is a first - order transition from a metal to a mott insulator when @xmath49,@xcite mean - field rvb calculations in the thermodynamic limit find a remarkably similar result with a first order mott transition occurring at @xmath50.@xcite when @xmath51 the effective spin hamiltonian in mott insulating phase should include ring exchange terms of order @xmath52 ( ref . ) . on the triangular lattice",

    "extensive studies of this model have been made.@xcite these studies show that the sign of @xmath30 has a significant effect on the type of ground state.@xcite rvb calculations@xcite found that , for @xmath4 , @xmath57 superconductivity was possible for a range of dopings and suggested a variety of unusual metallic states .",
    "series expansions@xcite have emphasised the competition between singlet and triplet formation on the triangular lattice in terms of competition between rvb states and nagaoka ferromagnetism .",
    "this work concludes that for hole doping the rvb state is favoured by @xmath4 and the nagaoka state is favoured by @xmath2 .",
    "changing the sign of @xmath30 is equivalent to changing from electron to hole doping , therefore this result is entirely consistent with the results summarised in fig .",

    "however , the band structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is still controversial .",
    "@xcite seems to suggest that a simple tight binding model with @xmath2 on the triangular lattice may be sufficient to describe the @xmath59 bands of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "however , even within a single band model hopping matrix elements up to at least 3rd nearest neighbors @xcite need to be included in order to correctly reproduce the lda band structure .",
    "further , lda calculations @xcite predict the existence of six small elliptical hole pockets near to the k - points if @xmath60 .",
    "it is not clear , at this point , whether or not the elliptical pockets actually exist.@xcite in contrast to the @xmath59 bands , the lda dispersion of the @xmath61 bands is better fitted to a @xmath4 triangular lattice tight - binding dispersion@xcite .",
    "several attempts @xcite have been made to estimate @xmath3 for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 ; all of these find that @xmath62 .",
    "this is much larger than in the organic charge transfer salts such as @xmath8-(et)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath9 or @xmath10-[pd(dmit)@xmath1]@xmath12 , in which @xmath35 ( ref . and references therein ) .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind the limitations of this hamiltonian as a model for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the charge ordered state observed in a narrow region around @xmath15 seems likely to be due to the response of the electronic system to the ordering of the na atoms which is observed even at high temperatures by x - ray diffraction .",
    "@xcite therefore one does not expect this phase to appear in purely electronic models such as those considered here . nevertheless , before attempting to understand more complicated models with realistic band structures ( including possibly multiple bands ) or including the effects of na ordering",
    ", it is important to have a firm understanding of strong correlations in simple frustrated models .",
    "therefore , despite the remarks above , we present below a dmft study of the hubbard model on a triangular lattice ( [ tight ] ) . in section [ sec : beyond - hub ] we discuss extensions to the hubbard model which allow one to investigate such effects .",
    "geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetism has been studied extensively and the triangular lattice provides a model system to investigate .",
    "three of the most widely used quantitative measures of frustration in antiferromagnets are ( i ) the degeneracy of the ground state , ( ii ) the magnitude of the entropy at low temperatures , and ( iii ) the ratio of the ground state energy to the total energy of maximising the individual interaction energies.@xcite    in a non - interacting electron model the only proposal we are aware of for a quantitative measure of the geometrical frustration of the kinetic energy is due to barford and kim.@xcite they noted that , for @xmath4 , an electron at the bottom of the band does not gain the full lattice kinetic energy , while a hole at the top of the band does .",
    "they suggested that for tight binding models a measure of the frustration is then @xmath63 are the energies ( relative to the energy of the system with no electrons ) of the top and bottom of the band respectively .",
    "this frustration increases the density of states for positive energies for @xmath4 ( negative energies for @xmath2 ) which represents an increased degeneracy and enhances the many - body effects when the fermi energy is in this regime . however , perhaps a simpler measure of the kinetic energy frustration is @xmath64 , where @xmath32 is the bandwidth and @xmath65 is the coordination number of the lattice",
    ". the smaller this ratio , the stronger the frustration is , while for an unfrustrated lattice @xmath66 .",
    "for example , on the triangular lattice the kinetic energy frustration leads to a bandwidth , @xmath67 , instead of @xmath68 as one might navely predict from @xmath69 since @xmath70 .",
    "we show below that geometrical frustration of the kinetic energy is a key concept required to understand the properties of the hubbard model on the triangular lattice .",
    "in particular it leads to particle - hole asymmetry which enhances many - body effects for electron ( hole ) doped @xmath4 ( @xmath2 ) lattices .",
    "it should be noted that geometrical frustration of the kinetic energy is a strictly quantum mechanical effect arising from quantum interference .",
    "this interference arises from hopping around triangular clusters which will have an amplitude proportional to @xmath71 which clearly changes sign when @xmath30 changes sign .",
    "in contrast on the , unfrustrated , square lattice the smallest possible cluster is the square the amplitude for hopping around a square is independent of the sign of @xmath30 as it is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "barford and kim@xcite noted that the phase collected by hopping around a frustrated cluster may be exactly cancelled by the aharonov - bohm phase associated with hopping around the cluster for a particular choice of applied magnetic field .",
    "thus a magnetic field may be used to lift the effects of kinetic energy frustration .",
    "the quantum mechanical nature of kinetic energy frustration is in distinct contrast to geometrical frustration in antiferromagnets which can occur for purely classical spins .        in order to gain some basic insights into some of the rich physics associated with the triangular lattice hubbard model",
    ", we now review the exact solution on a single triangle .",
    "this is the simplest possible model with kinetic frustration and strongly correlated electrons .",
    "this model already contains some of the features found in the solution of the hubbard model on the triangular lattice in the thermodynamic limit and gives significant insight into that problem .",
    "in particular the solution of this toy problem illustrates why the sign of @xmath30 is important and why ferromagnetism arises in the solution to a problem that only contains kinetic , local and ( via superexchange ) antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "let us begin by recalling the solution of the two site cluster with @xmath43 and spinless fermions .",
    "let us label the wannier functions on the two sites @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ". for @xmath4 the single electron ground state is the bonding orbital with wavefunction @xmath75 and energy @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath2 the single electron ground state is the antibonding orbital with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "( note that in general changing the sign of @xmath30 reverses the ordering of the energy levels . )",
    "thus @xmath79 for the two site cluster which , as @xmath80 for the two site lattice , fits with the general expectation that , for an unfrustrated lattice , the bandwidth is given by @xmath81 .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath43 triangular cluster has some significantly different properties compared to the two - site cluster . for @xmath4 the single electron ground state is completely bonding with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , but for @xmath2 we can not construct a completely antibonding solution and so the single electron ground state is degenerate with @xmath84 or @xmath85 and @xmath78 . thus even at the non - interacting level the bandwidth is reduced ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 which implies @xmath88 ) by the effects of geometric frustration . moving to noninteracting spin @xmath89 fermions",
    ", one can already see how the three site cluster with @xmath4 is easier to magnetize than the @xmath2 case . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the energy level structure of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 three site clusters containing four electrons are displayed .",
    "it costs no energy to flip one spin in the cluster , @xmath90 , for @xmath4 whereas there is an energy cost of @xmath91 associated with flipping a spin in the @xmath2 case .",
    "we will see in section [ secferro ] that this tendency to ferromagnetism persists in the non - interacting triangular lattice .      for a strongly interacting system",
    "the filling factor @xmath93 will play an important role in the solution .",
    "a non - trivial case in the triangle relevant to na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath95 case is trivial as is simply the case of a single ( and therefore non - interacting ) hole , while the half filled case will not be studied in detail in this paper .",
    "the relevant basis set is rather different from that for non - interacting particles and we therefore illustrate the solution in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . to represent this basis set",
    "more precisely we will adopt the notation @xmath96 where the values of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 indicate the state on the first , second and third sites respectively .",
    "we allow @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 to take the values @xmath100 , indicating an unoccupied site , @xmath101 , indicating a site singly occupied with a spin up electron , @xmath102 , indicating a site singly occupied with a spin down electron , and @xmath103 which indicates a doubly occupied site.@xcite for @xmath2 we find that for any finite @xmath3 the ground state has energy@xcite @xmath104 and is a superposition of singlets @xmath105 and the normalisation factor is @xmath106 .",

    "we sketch this wavefunction in the lower part of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath111 is a superposition of the resonating valence bond state and the states with two doubly occupied sites .",
    "the fact that @xmath107 as @xmath108 indicates that the amplitude for having two doubly occupied sites vanishes in this limit as one expects .",
    "clearly @xmath111 has no net magnetization , this state leads to the paramagnetic state found in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath2 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath111 has significant short - range antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which are not captured in the purely local dmft treatment that follows , although it is likely that these persist in the true thermodynamic ground state ( see section [ sec : tri - lat - rev ] ) .",

    "@xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 display short range ferromagnetic fluctuations for all finite @xmath3 , in particular the total spin of the system is a maximum along one axis as the ground state consists of a superposition of triplets .",
    "as the ferromagnetism is associated with kinetic energy frustration , we have a nagaoka type ferromagnet for any finite value of @xmath3 .",
    "in the calculations for the infinite triangular lattice with @xmath4 presented below we will again see this type of magnetism for some fillings , but with a phase transition from a curie - weiss metal to a nagaoka ferromagnet at some finite value of @xmath3 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in order to quantify the nature and magnitude of the spin interactions induced by the correlations we evaluate the expectation value of @xmath119 for neigbouring sites on the triangle .",
    "we find that for @xmath120 , this expectation value is 1/12 , whereas for @xmath121 it is @xmath122 $ ] which becomes more negative with increasing @xmath3 and tends to -1/6 for @xmath123 . for reference , for the two site hubbard model , with two electrons ,",
    "this expectation value is always negative , regardless of the sign of @xmath30 , indicating antiferromagnetic spin correlations . here",
    ", we see that for the triangular cluster , the sign of @xmath30 determines whether the nearest neighbour spin correlations are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "before presenting our results an important issue to address is the relevance of dmft to model ( [ hamilt ] ) which describes a two - dimensional system .",
    "dmft is only exact in infinite dimensions or for a lattice with infinite coordination number .",
    "we will see below that an important role of the triangular lattice , as compared to other , non - frustrated , lattices , is not just that the shape of the bare dos changes ( which is extremely important ) but also to make dmft a good approximation .",
    "dmft has become an important tool in the description of strongly correlated systems .",
    "it has provided a realistic description of transport and dynamical properties of materials such as transition metal oxides and layered organic superconductors with frustrated lattices such as @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath124 where @xmath12 is an anion , e.g. , i@xmath9 or cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath124 family have a phase diagram ( as a function of pressure , uniaxial stress , or chemical substitution ) in which a superconducting phase is in close proximity to a mott insulating phase . in the metallic phase of the @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath124",
    "there is a temperature scale , @xmath7 , at which there is a smooth crossover from a fermi liquid to an incoherent `` bad metal '' [ characterized by the absence of a drude peak in the frequency dependent conductivity , a resistivity of the order of the ioffe - regel - mott limit ( @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the lattice constant ) , a thermopower of the order of @xmath127 , and a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the thermopower and resistivity].@xcite the temperature dependence of transport properties displays a crossover from coherent fermi liquid behavior to incoherent excitations . in the case of the organic superconductors it has been found that the dmft of the hubbard model gives both a qualitative@xcite and quantitative@xcite description of this crossover from a fermi liquid to a `` bad metal '' in which there are no quasi - particles .",
    "the crossover temperature scale is related to the destruction of kondo screening and fermi liquid behavior with increasing temperature ( above the kondo temperature @xmath128 ) in the anderson model ( which is the effective model solved in the dmft equations as described above ) . in the anderson model",
    "the conduction electrons are strongly scattered by a ( localised ) magnetic impurity for @xmath129 .",
    "but for @xmath130 a singlet forms between the impurity and the conduction electrons . in the dmft of the hubbard model for @xmath6",
    "the electrons are quasi - localised and the electrons on the single site treated exactly strongly scatter those in the bath . however ,",
    "for @xmath131 transport is coherent and the electrons only scatter one another weakly , thus fermi liquid behaviour is regained .",
    "this is why , for example , the temperature dependence of the resistivities of the anderson and hubbard models are so similar .    the success of dmft in describing the transport properties and the phase diagram of many organic charge transfer salts down to temperatures of about 10 - 20 k ( where , for example , superconductivity becomes important ) has been rather puzzling given that these materials are quasi - two - dimensional and dmft is only expected to be a good approximation in the limit of high dimension or co - ordination number .",
    "however , the applicability of dmft to low - dimensional systems with large frustration is consistent with the fact that for frustrated magnetic models a curie - weiss law holds down to a much lower temperature than for unfrustrated models@xcite indicating the presence of well formed local moments .",
    "recently , zheng _",
    "et al_. @xcite calculated the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "they found that for models close to the isotropic triangular lattice ( i.e. , models with significant magnetic frustration ) that the curie - weiss law ( which is a mean - field , single site approximation ) holds down to relatively low temperatures .",
    "deviations from curie - weiss behavior result from spatially dependent correlations .",
    "hence , we expect that a dmft treatment of the hubbard model on the triangular lattice will be a good approximation down to much lower temperatures than unfrustrated models .",
    "furthermore , in the `` bad metal '' region magnetic properties such as the uniform susceptibility and spin relaxation rate , can be described by the heisenberg model because the electrons are essentially localized due to the proximity to the mott insulating phase .",
    "this means that the susceptibility can be fit to a curie - weiss form down to temperatures much less than the exchange energy @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , the spin correlation length of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model increases with temperature @xmath133 much more slowly for the triangular lattice than the square lattice.@xcite specifically , at @xmath134 the spin correlation length is only one lattice constant for the triangular lattice .",
    "in contrast , for the square lattice the correlation length is about 50 lattice constants , at @xmath134.@xcite    the above arguments have been recently tested by means of cluster dmft calculations .",

    "in particular for the triangular lattice with @xmath2 ( which , of the two cases we considered , gives the band structure closest to those suggested by both arpes and lda - dft ) the dmft of the electron doped hubbard model closely resembles a weakly interacting metal .",

    "on the other hand many of the results for @xmath4 are qualitatively consistent with the picture drawn by experiments on na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "in particular we propose that the experimental ` curie - weiss metal ' is little more than the `` bad metal '' in the extreme situation of very strong electronic correlations and high frustration .",
    "important experimental support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that a fermi liquid like resistivity has only been observed@xcite when @xmath25  k which suggests that @xmath302  k. an obvious objection , that @xmath7 predicted by dmft will not be this small for any reasonable parameters , will be discussed below ( sec .",

    "our results for @xmath4 show that magnetism is a genuinely quantum many - body effect , in particular the magnetism has little resemblance to simple stoner ferromagnetism .",

    "the observation@xcite that the strength of the effective in - plane ferromagnetic coupling in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is the same order of magnitude as the effective interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction despite of the highly two - dimensional crystal- and band - structures of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 is naturally explained in this scenario as the effective ferromagnetic interaction in the nagaoka is much weaker than the intrinsic antiferromagnetic interaction which gives rise to the phase .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , here @xmath197 becomes positive and ferromagnetism is suppressed by reducing the doping towards the critical doping which is the lower bound for which ferromagnetism is observed .",

    "lda calculations predict that the dispersion of the bands is rather different to the dispersion obtained from a nearest - neighbor isotropic triangular lattice .",
    "in particular the lda band is much flatter close to the @xmath179-point .",
    "indeed this is just the sort of change that is likely to have a significant effect on the results of the type of calculations we have presented above . in the current work we have also neglected the possibility of fermi surface pockets near the @xmath308-points arising from the @xmath309 band . @xcite",
    "recall that , for example , we demonstrated that the magnetism and curie - weiss metal behavior we observed in the triangular lattice depend crucially on the dos _ near _ to the fermi level and not just on the dos _ at _ the fermi energy .",

    "this has the same frequency and wavevector dependence as one obtains from an rpa treatment of a fermi liquid metal .    within this framework",

    "also a small magnetic field is expected to rapidly suppress @xmath156 and @xmath99 as experimentally observed in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "the above arguments are consistent with evidence of strong ferromagnetic fluctuations acting in the co - planes for @xmath364 from recent neutron scattering experiments.@xcite in order to determine the importance of these spatial correlations it is desirable to compare the measurements of @xmath365 in ref . with the form ( [ moriya1 ] ) .",

    "hence , @xmath370 k and so the ferromagnetic fluctuations could be the origin of the low energy scale in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "we believe that the a - type antiferromagnetic phase observed experimentally corresponds to the ferromagnetic phase predicted by dmft and many of the metallic state properties can be interpreted in terms of their proximity to a ferromagnetic transition and strong coulomb repulsion effects .",
    "however , a number of experiments suggest that na@xmath0coo@xmath1 behaves like it is more strongly correlated as the doping , @xmath21 , is increased .",
    "these results are difficult to understand from a simple model which only contains the co planes as such models become more weakly correlated as the electronic doping is increased due to the small number of holes left in the co - planes . below",
    "we propose that the ordering of the na atoms observed at many dopings provides a natural explanation of these effects as it can effectively drive the system towards half filling by introducing a spatial modulation of the site energy of the co atoms .",
    "the suggestion that na ordering plays a crucial role that has not been appreciated until now is made more plausible by the very sensitive dependence of the magnetic and transport properties on the exact details of the dos that we have demonstrated above .",
    "it seems likely that the charge ordering of the electrons in the coo@xmath1 layers observed at @xmath15 is induced by na ordering.@xcite recently , experimental studies by zandbergen _",

    "for each of these we take the orderings proposed by zhang _",
    "et al_. @xcite and zandbergen _",
    "et al_. @xcite although we note that in two of these cases ( @xmath375 and 0.75 ) roger _ et al_. have proposed different na ordering patterns which involve the formation of ` vacancy droplets ' .",
    "we stress that this work has nothing to contribute to the debate over which patterns are , in fact , realised and we take these patterns at @xmath375 and 0.75 merely to exemplify our point . in the cases of @xmath376 and 0.5 we find that the na ordering introduces two co sublattices while for @xmath375 we find three co sublattices and for @xmath377 we find four co sublattices . for this analysis one needs to consider the two possible locations of na in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , referred to as na(1 ) and na(2).@xcite the coo@xmath1 planes are at @xmath378 , where @xmath23 is the lattice constant perpendicular to the cobaltate layers .",
    "the na(1 ) sites lie directly above ( at @xmath379 ) and below ( @xmath380 ) the co atoms , while the na(2 ) sites are above or below the centres of the triangles in the triangular lattice formed by the co atoms .",
    "the simplest model which can include the effects na ordering is a hubbard model which includes the co site energy modulated by the number of nearest na sites that are occupied .",
    "clearly , one expects that occupied na(1 ) and na(2 ) will modulate the co site energy by different amounts which we denote @xmath381 and @xmath382 respectively .",

    "this model assumes that the electronic degrees of freedom relax on much shorter time scales than the na ions move , which is reasonable because of the relative masses , even though the effective quasiparticles mass is an order of magnitude larger than the bare electronic mass .    to simplify our notation",
    "we now introduce the following nomenclature , @xmath387 this allows us to sketch the relevant lattices in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",

    "for example for @xmath15 and @xmath395 ( as one might expect ) and @xmath27 a charge ordered insulator is likely to be the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eqn : order ] ) , this is the state observed in na@xmath396coo@xmath1 .",
    "et al_. have estimated from classical electrostatics that @xmath397  mev which is consistent with this scenario .",
    "further this kind of effect will drive the system closer to mott insulating phase if the occupation of one or more of the sublattices is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus we expect that the dmft treatment of ( [ eqn : order ] ) will have significantly better qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 than the dmft treatment of the hubbard model on a triangular lattice does .",
    "finally we note that , if one of the sublattices of @xmath15 can be ` integrated out ' of the effective low energy theory due to a large disparity in the site energies we are left with a mott insulator on a rectangular lattice .",

    "no ferromagnetism has been found for any band filling or any value of @xmath3 when @xmath2 , which is qualitatively different from the prediction of stoner theory .",
    "we conclude that the ferromagnetism we have observed is much more closely related to nagaoka ferromagnetism .",
    "the different behaviour of the two lattices is due to kinetic energy frustration which dramatically reduces the energy cost of polarizing the system for @xmath4 .",
    "we have therefore proposed that the a - type antiferromagnetic phase observed in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 for @xmath22 is the result of in plane nagaoka type ferromagnetism .",
    "the different behaviors encountered away from half - filling for the different signs of @xmath30 contrasts with the system sufficiently close to the mott insulating phase ( @xmath238 and @xmath414 or @xmath415 and @xmath26 ) . in this case , the model displays very similar properties including curie - weiss susceptibility with @xmath416 ( due to antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction close to half - filling ) , a large effective mass enhancement , ( @xmath417 for @xmath188 ) , large low-@xmath133 resistivity coefficient , and enhanced kadowaki - woods ratio .",
    "thus our results show that the details of the band structure are extremely important for understanding the metallic and spin ordered phases of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 . in particular , a simple one - band hubbard model on a triangular lattice is not enough to understand the unconventional properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "our results however do suggest that the curie - weiss susceptibility observed in the metallic phase of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 results from incoherent quasi - localized electrons .",
    "remarkably , the dmft estimate of @xmath418  k is in good agreement with the curie - weiss constant @xmath357  k experimentally measured .",
    "many of the thermodynamic and transport properties observed in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , for large @xmath21 , are consistent with the dmft prediction of the transport and magnetic properties of the metal very close to the mott transition .",
    "we have proposed that mott physics is relevant to na@xmath5coo@xmath1 even when @xmath21 is large and the system is far away from the mott insulating phase because of experimental observation of charge ordering in the co planes .",
    "the @xmath133 dependence of several transport and magnetic properties is consistent with the dmft description of a metal close to the mott transition for @xmath6 .",
    "however , at very low temperatures , experimental observations on na@xmath5coo@xmath1 , depart from our dmft results .",
    "for instance , the susceptibility deviates significantly from the curie - weiss behavior being strongly enhanced below @xmath419 k. also transport and thermodynamic quantities are very sensitive to a small applied magnetic field .",
    "one is tempted to associate the very low temperature scale of about @xmath420  k experimentally determined to the dmft coherence scale , @xmath7 , which goes to 0 as the system approaches the mott insulating state .",
    "however , such a small value of @xmath7 implies an extremely large effective mass enhancement in clear disagreement with experimental values , @xmath421 .",
    "we conclude that this very small energy scale is due to low energy ferromagnetic fluctuations in the co - planes which are neglected within the dmft",
    ". these fluctuations would scatter the strongly renormalized quasiparticles which are properly described by dmft .",
    "we have then used this analysis to help identify the simplest relevant model that captures the essential physics in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "we have proposed a model which contains the charge ordering phenomena observed in the system that we have proposed drive the system close to the mott insulating phase for the large dopings .",
    "band structure calculations find that the a@xmath406 band can be roughly fitted to a tight - binding model with @xmath2 which roughly describes the large hole pocket around the @xmath179 point .",
    "additional small hole pockets may be present in the fermi surface associated with the e@xmath407 bands crossing the fermi energy .",
    "these bands can be fitted to a @xmath4 tight - binding band for which ferromagnetic fluctuations are likely to exist .",
    "hence , a multiband dmft treatment containing the a@xmath406 and e@xmath407 bands as well as charge ordering phenomena should describe both the following aspects : ( i ) the proximity of the metal to a mott insulating phase leading to renormalized quasiparticles and curie - weiss behavior for @xmath6 and ( ii ) the strong ferromagnetic fluctuations appearing at low temperatures .",
    "we believe that a model including both of these ingredients is needed to fully understand the physics of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
