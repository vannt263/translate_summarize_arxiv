    "combinatorial optimization stands as one of the most fruitful fields in the intersection of applied and pure mathematics : it connects the theory of the computational hardness to the techniques widely used in the search for global minima for complex functionals , i.e. functions with many local minima . over the years",
    "there have been many strategies proposed to solve efficiently hard computational problems @xcite . among them the statistical mechanics approach @xcite has opened new interesting perspectives . in this paper",
    "we study the interpolation between two algorithms , the greedy and the reluctant .",
    "the first is the standard decrease along the deepest descent direction , while the second is the closest decrease to the level lines . in previous works",
    "@xcite we have studied and compared the two algorithms focusing on relaxation time and minimum reached level .",
    "we observed , moreover , how a simple convex interpolation between them could improve the performances of both of them in large size regime . in this work",
    "we push further such analysis introducing a _ smooth interpolation _ between greedy and reluctant depending on a parameter @xmath0 : small @xmath0 plays the role of the greedy algorithm , while large @xmath0 that of reluctant .",
    "this allows us a better tuning among the two and especially a parameter optimization .",
    "the newly introduced algorithm is tested against a model which has become the standard of np complete problems : the sherrington kirkpatrick model of the mean field spin glass .",
    "our results confirm and extend those in @xcite : we find that the relaxation time grows linearly when the algorithm is close to the greedy regime and quadratically when it is close to the reluctant one with a progressive condensation for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics is then tested in the search for low energy configurations for fixed values of initial conditions , where the reluctant dynamics works substantially better than any other .",
    "the main result of this work is then the minimization at fixed elapsed computer time . in this case ,",
    "in fact , we find that in the small size regime ( compared to total search time ) the greedy component performs better than any other due the short relaxation time and the fact that , basically , the dynamics is able to find the ground state or , at least , to get very close to it . moreover and more interestingly , we find that increasing the system size does not lead to a uniform deteriorating of the greedy performance toward an improvement of the reluctant one .",
    "we find , in fact , an optimal value of @xmath1 , for which the lowest energies are reached against a rather poor performance of the greedy @xmath2 and reluctant algorithm @xmath3 .",
    "this optimal value appears to be independent of the size .",
    "let us consider the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 for @xmath6 are spin variables which interact through an @xmath7 symmetric matrix with @xmath8 independent , identically distributed gaussian random couplings @xmath9 with zero mean and variance @xmath10 .",
    "we focus our attention on a stochastic energy - decreasing dynamics that , starting from any initial spin configuration at time @xmath11 ( which we choose at random with uniform distribution ) , ends up on a local energy minimum .",
    "the evolution rule is :    1 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the spin configuration at time @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   calculate the spectrum of energy change obtained by flipping the spin in position @xmath14 , for @xmath15 : @xmath16 if @xmath17 , @xmath18 , then the algorithm stops ( @xmath19 is a local minimum ) .",
    "3 .   generate a random number @xmath20 with probability density @xmath21 4 .",
    "select the site @xmath22 associated with the closest energy change to the value @xmath20 , i.e. : @xmath23 5 .",
    "flip the spin on site @xmath22 : @xmath24    this algorithm generates a dynamics that , following a @xmath25-spin flip decreasing energy trajectory , arrives at a @xmath25-spin flip stable configuration , that is a configuration whose energy can not be decreased by a single spin - flip .",
    "the speed of convergence to local energy minima is tuned by @xmath0 , the control parameter in the probability distribution function for the move acceptance . of course , the larger is @xmath0 , the bigger it is the probability of doing small energy - decreasing steps , so that the trajectory will follow an evolution path close to level curves ( reluctant ) . on the other hand , small values of @xmath0",
    "enrich the probability of large negative energy steps , which will quickly drive the dynamic to the end - point ( greedy ) . in the next section , by varying the control parameter @xmath0 , we study the efficiency of the algorithm by measuring the average time to reach a metastable configuration and the lowest energy value found as the system size is increased .",
    "we performed a set of experiments for different values of @xmath26 , starting from @xmath26 initial conditions ( for a system of size @xmath26 ) and averaging the data on @xmath27 disorder realizations .",
    "we probed basically two quantities to measure the performance of the algorithm :    * the average time ( i.e. the number of spin flips ) to reach a minimum energy level @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 the time for each initial condition * the lowest energy found ( averaged over disorder ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the minimum value of the energy of the metastable states attained starting from @xmath26 initial conditions .    in fig.1",
    "we represent @xmath34 as a function of @xmath26 in the range @xmath35 $ ] for six distinct values of @xmath0 ( @xmath36 ) , together with the best numerical fits .",
    "because of high computational costs ( which increase with @xmath0 ) , the case @xmath37 is studied in details only for @xmath38 and @xmath39 . on the other hand , the average time has good self - averaging properties so that , in order to have the trend for `` large '' @xmath0 we focused on the case @xmath40 with @xmath41 disorder realizations instead of @xmath27 . from fig.1",
    "we observe the progressive increase of the slope in log - log scale from an almost linear law in @xmath26 for @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) to an almost quadratic one for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , this algorithm behaves as a `` smooth interpolation '' between the two deterministic dynamics : `` greedy '' , that we obtain for @xmath38 , and `` reluctant '' , here represented by @xmath43 .",
    "more in detail , the numerical fits of fig.1 are : @xmath45 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the fits are quite good for all the cases but @xmath39 and @xmath55 . in these cases",
    "the quality of the fit is enhanced excluding the data corresponding to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "so we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 .     to reach a metastable configuration as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath39 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath61 ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath43 ( @xmath44).,title=\"fig:\",width=491,height=377 ] ( -1.5,0)@xmath26 ( -12.5,9)@xmath34 ( -1.8,9.36 ) ( -1.95,9.1 ) ( -1.95,8.79 ) ( -1.95,8.51 ) ( -1.95,8.22 ) ( -2.05,7.95 )    next , we measured the lowest energy found by the algorithm . in fig.2",
    "we represent @xmath62 as a function of @xmath26 for different values of @xmath0 and for a fixed number of @xmath26 initial conditions .",
    "while , for small @xmath26 , the ground state is believed to be closely approximated for all values of @xmath0 ( in fact , varying @xmath0 , the lowest energy @xmath62 undergoes a relative change of @xmath63 for @xmath56 and of @xmath64 for @xmath57 and @xmath65 ) , the best results for large @xmath26 @xmath66 are obtained for @xmath43 which corresponds to deterministic reluctant dynamics .",
    "therefore , this confirms that , for a fixed number of initial spin configurations , the algorithm that makes moves corresponding to the `` smallest '' possible energy decrease is the most efficient in reaching low - energy states . in other words , the slower @xmath67 the better",
    "however , this is reflected in an increasing cost for the computational time .",
    "as a function of @xmath26 obtained using a protocol with @xmath26 initial conditions for @xmath68 disorder realizations for @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath39 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath61 ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath43 ( @xmath44).,title=\"fig:\",width=491,height=377 ] ( -0.9,0)@xmath26 ( -12.7,9.2)@xmath62 ( -1.8,9.36 ) ( -1.95,9.1 ) ( -1.95,8.79 ) ( -1.95,8.51 ) ( -1.95,8.22 ) ( -2.05,7.95 )    indeed , when the analysis is focused on the performances for a fixed elapsed time , the situation changes drastically . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the minimum energy values @xmath62 , obtained considering different system sizes and , for each of them , five different parameter values ( @xmath69 ) for an elapsed time of @xmath65 h of cpu on a ibm sp4 .",
    "the system size @xmath70 is studied only for @xmath39 , @xmath55 and @xmath60 . each run",
    "( i.e. for fixed @xmath26 and @xmath0 ) consists of @xmath68 disorder realizations , with the same cpu time length ( @xmath71 min . ) assigned to each sample .",
    "for @xmath72 we believe to find the ground state of the system , since varying @xmath0 the values of @xmath62 coincide , within our numerical accuracy ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the best result is obtained for the case @xmath39 , which seems to be the best compromise to obtain a dynamical trajectory that is able to arrive deep enough with respect to energy levels but without wasting all the time in the search for the slower of possible path .",
    "we note that this finding is in good agreement with the result of previous analysis @xcite , where a convex linear combination of reluctant ( with probability p ) and greedy ( with probability @xmath74 ) dynamics was considered .",
    "the optimal value @xmath1 is the one for which the relaxation time @xmath75 grows with a scaling exponent @xmath76 which is the closest , among the others , to the value @xmath77 of the optimal convex combination with @xmath78 .     as a function of @xmath26 for a fixed cpu time of @xmath65 h on a ibm sp4 for @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath39 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath43",
