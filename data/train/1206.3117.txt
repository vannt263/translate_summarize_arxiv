    "note that in order to have a state to state correspondence between the boson and fermion theory , the fermion theory contains both the periodic and anti - periodic sectors .",
    "since the @xmath8 symmetry in the nontrivial @xmath8 spt phase only act on , say , the right moving sector , one may naively guess that only @xmath180 change sign , while @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 do not change under the @xmath8 transformation : @xmath184 . in this case , the fermion mass term , such as @xmath185 , will be allowed by the @xmath8 symmetry .",

    ", we will show that the @xmath8 symmetry is actually realized in a different way .",
    "the @xmath89 edge state is stable if the @xmath8 symmetry is not broken .",
    "so the @xmath89 edge state represents the minimal edge state for the @xmath8 ( as well as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) spt phases .",

    "therefore , the fermion theory contains two sectors , one with an even number of fermions and therefore anti - periodic boundary condition and one with an odd number of fermions and periodic boundary condition . without terms mixing the two sectors , we can solve the free fermion hamiltonian in each sector separately .",

    "note that with this filling the parity constraint in each sector is automatically satisfied .",
    "the ground state energy in the periodic sector is higher than in the anti - periodic sector and the difference is inverse proportional to system size @xmath48 .      the @xmath200 operator or the @xmath201 operator in the boson theory ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy_z2x ] ) corresponds to changing the boundary condition of the dirac fermion from periodic to anti - periodic .",
    "such operators would totally gap out the edge states .",

    "@xmath217 ) becomes exponentially small with nonzero @xmath213 .",
    "therefore , upon adding the @xmath206 and @xmath207 terms , the ground state becomes two fold degenerate .",
    "such an operator does carry trivial quantum number in the nontrivial @xmath8 spt phase and renders the gapless edge unstable .",
    "however , a two fold degeneracy would always be left over in the ground states , indicating a spontaneous @xmath8 symmetry breaking at the edge .",

    "its combination with the @xmath220 operator ( @xmath221 in the fermion theory ) would gap out the system .",

    "however , for the periodic sector , such a construction fails since there is a @xmath226 = even number of negative energy modes , and the periodic sector must contain an odd number of fermions .",
    "so we have to add an fermion to a positive energy mode ( or have a hole in a negative energy mode ) , to have an odd number of fermions .",
    "therefore , the ground state in the periodic sector has a finite energy gap above the anti - periodic one and the ground state of the whole system is nondegenerate .",

    "<S> the experimental detection of such edge modes@xcite has attracted much attention and a lot of efforts have been put into the exploration of new spt phases .    </S>",

    "<S> understanding of how symmetry acts chirally on the edge state of the @xmath8 spt phase suggests that similar situations might appear in other spt phases as well . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we are going to show that it is indeed the case for @xmath0 bosonic spt phases . from the group cohomology construction , we know that there are @xmath48 @xmath0-spt phases which form a @xmath0 group among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to construct 1d rotor models to realize the edge state in each spt phase which satisfies certain non - onsite symmetry related to the nontrivial elements in @xmath49 $ ] . from these models </S>",
    "<S> we can see explicitly how the symmetry acts in a chiral way on the low energy states . </S>",
    "<S> taking the limit of @xmath50 in @xmath0 will lead to the understanding of the edge states in @xmath1 spt phases which we discuss in the next section . </S>",
    "<S> note that the choice of the local hilbert space on the edge , here a quantum rotor , is arbitrary and will not affect the universal physics of the spt phase as long as the effective symmetry belongs to the same cohomology class .    consider a 1d chain of quantum rotors describe by @xmath51 $ ] with conjugate momentum @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the chain is given by hamiltonian h_r=_i ( l_i)^2 + v ( _ i-_i-1 ) [ hr ] when @xmath53 , the system is in the gapless superfluid phase . at low energy , @xmath54 varies smoothly along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the gapless low energy effective theory is again described by a compactified boson field @xmath19 with compactification radius @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy excitations contain both left and right moving bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> the generator of the non - onsite @xmath0 symmetry related to the @xmath56th element ( @xmath57 ) of the cohomology group , hence the @xmath56th spt phase with @xmath0 symmetry , takes the following form in this rotor chain : u^(m)_n = _ i cp^(m)_i , i+1 _ i e^i2l_i / n [ umn ] where @xmath58 acts on two neighboring rotors and depends on @xmath56 as @xmath59 here we need to be careful with the phase factor @xmath60 because it is not a single - valued function </S>",
    "<S> . we confine @xmath61 to be within @xmath62 $ ] and denote it as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath64 becomes single valued but also discontinuous when @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity will not be a problem for us in the following discussion . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is important that @xmath66 , because otherwise the symmetry factors into onsite operations and becomes trivial . </S>",
    "<S> we show in appendix c[umn_coh ] that @xmath67 indeed generates a @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover from its matrix product unitary operator representation we find that the transformation among the representing tensors are indeed related to the @xmath56th element in the cohomology group @xmath49 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the 1d rotor model represents one possible realization of the edge states in the corresponding spt phases . </S>",
    "<S> ( the matrix product unitary operator formalism and its relation to group cohomology was studied in and we review the main results in appendix b[mpuo ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry operator @xmath68 has a complicated form but its physical meaning will become clear if we consider its action on the low energy states of the rotor model in eqn.([hr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> first the @xmath69 part rotates all rotors by the same angle @xmath70 , which can be equivalently written as @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the total angular momentum of the rotors . at low energy </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath73 is the total boson number with integer values @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at low energy @xmath54 varies smoothly along the chain therefore @xmath74 and @xmath58 adds a phase factor to the differential change in @xmath54 along the chain </S>",
    "<S> . multiplied along the whole chain @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 where @xmath39 is the winding number of the boson field @xmath19 along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> put together we find that the symmetry acts on the low energy modes as [ umn1 ] u^(m)_n ~e^i2(l+mm)/n if @xmath56 is zero , this symmetry comes from a trivial spt phase and @xmath77 depends only on @xmath38 which involves the left and right movers equally , as one can see from right- and left - scaling dimensions @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath56 is nonzero , this symmetry comes from a nontrivial spt phase and @xmath68 depends on @xmath79 which involves the left and right mover in an unequal way . </S>",
    "<S> put it differently , the symmetry on the edge of nontrivial @xmath0 spt phases acts chirally . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath80 , the symmetry will act only on the right movers . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the discussion in the @xmath8 case , we can see that the chiral symmetry protects the gaplessness of the edge by preventing direct scattering between the left and right branches .    </S>",
    "<S> one may notice that @xmath81(eqn.([hr ] ) ) does not exactly commute with the symmetry @xmath68 , but this will not be a problem for our discussions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the potential term @xmath82 does commute with @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic term @xmath83 commute with the part that rotates @xmath54 but not the phase factor @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low energy , @xmath84 , therefore this term becomes irrelevant locally and commutation between the hamiltonian and the symmetry operator is restored . at high energy , in order for the hamiltonian to satisfy the symmetry , we can change the kinetic term to @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy dynamics will be changed . however , because @xmath53 and we know that the modified hamiltonian does not break the @xmath1 symmetry of the rotor model and the system can not be gapped ( due to the nontrivial cohomology class related to the symmetry ) , the system remains in the superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the kinetic term does not affect our discussion about low energy effective physics .    </S>",
    "<S> _ edge state of @xmath1 spt phase _  taking the limit of @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> , we can generalize our understanding of @xmath0 spt phases to @xmath1 spt phases . as we show in this section , the chiral symmetry action on the low energy effective modes on the edge of the @xmath1 spt phases leads to a chiral response of the system to externally coupled @xmath1 gauge field , even though the low energy edge state is non - chiral . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate explicitly the quantized hall conductance in these spt phases from the commutator of local density operators on the edge and find that they are quantized to even integer multiples of @xmath87 . in these spt phases , a nonzero @xmath1 hall conductance exists despite a zero thermal hall conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> > from group cohomology , we know that there are infinite 2d bosonic spt phases with @xmath1 symmetry which form the integer group @xmath88 among themselves . </S>",
    "<S> generalizing the discussion in the previous section we find that the low energy effective theory can be a @xmath89 free boson theory and the @xmath1 symmetry acts on the low energy modes as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , @xmath38 is the total boson number , @xmath39 is the winding number and @xmath92 labels the @xmath1 spt phase . </S>",
    "<S> the local density operator of this @xmath1 charge is given by @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the conjugate momentum of the boson field @xmath19 , because the spatial integration of this density operator gives rise to the generator of the @xmath1 symmetry @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the commutator between local density operators is given by @xmath96 = -i\\frac{2m}{2\\pi}\\delta'(x - x').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this term will give rise to a quantized hall conductance along the edge when the system is coupled to an external @xmath1 gauge field . compared to the commutator between local density operators of a single chiral fermion @xmath97 = -i\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\delta'(x - x'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the hall conductance is quantized to even integer @xmath98 multiples of @xmath87 .    as a consistency check </S>",
    "<S> we see that the quantized hall conductance is a universal feature of the edge states in the bosonic @xmath1 spt phases and does not depend on the particular form the @xmath1 symmetry is realized on the edge . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the @xmath1 symmetry can be realized as @xmath99 , with arbitrary @xmath100 . from the group cohomology calculation ( reviewed in appendix b[mpuo ] ) we find that it belongs to the cohomology class labeled by @xmath101 . from the calculation of the commutator between local density operators </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the magnitude of the commutator is proportional also to @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the hall conductance depends only on the cohomology class  hence the spt phase  the system is in and not on the details of the dynamics in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion _  in this paper , we have construct the gapless edge states for _ each _ of the bosonic @xmath0 or @xmath1 spt phases in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> we show that those edge states are described by a @xmath89 non - chiral free boson theory where the symmetry acts chirally on the low energy modes . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral realization of the symmetry not only prevents some simple mass terms from gapping out the system but also leads to a chiral response of the system to external gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by constructing explicit 1d lattice models constrained by a non - onsite symmetry related to _ </S>",
    "<S> each _ nontrivial cohomology classes . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates that the field theory approach based on the @xmath4 chern - simons theory@xcite and @xmath5 non - linear @xmath6-model@xcite indeed produce all of the @xmath1 spt phases .    </S>",
    "<S> we want to emphasize that although we have focused exclusively on the 1d edge , a 2d bulk having the 1d chain as its edge always exists and can be constructed by treating a 1d ring as a single site and then putting the sites together . </S>",
    "<S> note that while the stability and chiral response of the edge in spt phases are very similar to that of the edge in quantum hall systems , the underlying reason is very different . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum hall edge states are chiral in its own , which remains gapless without the protection of any symmetry and leads to a nonzero thermal hall conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we want to point out that the edge theory constructed in this paper is only one possible form of realization . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that other gapless theories can be realized on the edge of spt phases , for example with central charge not equal to @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to understand in general what kind of gapless theories are possible and what their universal features are .    </S>",
