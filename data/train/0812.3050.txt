    "consider a mesh having one special @xmath1-vertex face and a `` strip '' of faces attached to the special face along the perimeter , such that any vertex of a special face is a vertex of exactly three faces in the strip .",
    "this mesh is called a _",
    "kokotsakis mesh_. kokotsakis meshes with polygonal faces are known in the literature as _ polyhedral surfaces of kokotsakis type_. in this paper we study conditions of flexibility and infinitesimal flexibility for kokotsakis meshes .    the first steps in studying such meshes were made in 1932 by a.  kokotsakis in his paper  @xcite , where he found conditions of infinitesimal flexibility .",
    "recently kokotsakis meshes for @xmath2-gons ( such meshes are also called _ @xmath3-meshes _ ) were used in the study of discrete conjugate nets flexibility .",
    "a.  i.  bobenko , t.  hoffmann , w.  k.  schief proved in  @xcite that a nondegenerate discrete conjugate net is isometrically deformable if and only if all its @xmath4 subcomplexes are isometrically deformable @xmath5-meshes . in",
    "@xcite they also showed that the conjugate nets admit infinitesimal second - order deformations if and only if their reciprocal - parallel surfaces constitute discrete bianchi surfaces ( see also  @xcite ) .    in this paper we give a geometrical interpretation of infinitesimal flexibility in terms of ceva and menelaus configurations .",
    "further we work with equations that define the set of flexible kokotsakis meshes , in particular we show semi - algebraicity of this set .",
    "the technique developed in this paper allows us to calculate linear independence of the gradients of the first 6 flexibility conditions for a chosen flexible quadrangular kokotsakis mesh .",
    "this means that we can check if the codimension of a stratum of meshes is smaller than or equal to 6 .",
    "the computational complexity of the problem does not allow us to proceed further .",
    "we remind the reader that the codimension of the set of flexible voss meshes as well as that of symmetric flexible meshes is 8 , for information on voss surfaces we refer to  @xcite .",
    "so it is most probable that the codimensions of irreducible components coincide , and equal  6 , 7 , or  8 .",
    "if we are lucky and these codimensions are exactly  8 , than the geometric solution of the problem can be obtained by enumeration of all possible components .    to check the conditions at a single point we introduce more simple `` flexibility vector calculus '' conditions . in the case of @xmath5-meshes",
    "we now able to calculate the 8 first such conditions .",
    "finally , for the case of quadrangular kokotsakis @xmath3-meshes we show that the property of the mesh to be flexible depends only on the shapes of faces but not on the geometry of the mesh in @xmath6 .",
