    "accretion onto a compact object invariably results in x - ray emission , with the luminosity determined by such important parameters as the size and mass of the accreting object , and the mass accretion rate .",
    "binary stars represent the best laboratories for the study of such accretion processes , where the accreting star can be a white dwarf , neutron star or a black hole . whereas known white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables are generally low luminosity x - ray sources , and relatively nearby ( most 1 kpc ) , the neutron star sources are often extremely luminous , and detectable at extragalactic distances .",
    "most ( 80% ) of the higher mass systems ( high mass x - ray binaries , or hmxbs ) , which consist of early spectral type ( o or b ) stars losing mass to their neutron star companions , are be / x - ray or supergiant binaries .",
    "the orbits of these binary systems are generally wide and eccentric , with periods in the range 0.7/1.4d for rx j0050.7 - 7316 ( coe & orosz , 2000 ) to 262d for sax j2239.3 + 6116 ( int zand et al , 2000 ) .",
    "usually the only optical signature of these stars is balmer emission , and in that respect alone it is often difficult to ascertain the x - ray nature of these systems . with",
    "be stars being relatively common in the galactic plane , it has only been possible to confirm be counterparts to x - ray sources using imaging x - ray instruments , as provided by such satellites as _ einstein _ ( heao-2 ) and _",
    "rosat_.    much progress in understanding the physics of these systems has resulted from multiwaveband campaigns , spanning the ir ",
    "uv  x - ray@xmath3-ray domains .",
    "observations of the be star in the optical and ir sheds light on the physical conditions under which the neutron star accretes .",
    "in addition , with contemporaneous x - ray observations , which provide direct information on the accretion process , it is possible to investigate the correlation between the mass loss rate from the be star and the accretion rate .",
    "thus it is possible , through long - term multi - wavelength programs , to build a more complete picture of the whole accretion process , and to study it as a function of time .    in this paper",
    "we report on two possible counterparts to a hard x - ray transient source in the smc , , which is most likely a new member of the be / x - ray binary subclass of hmxbs .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "position coincides with a previously know hard spectrum source from heao-2 ( _ einstein observatory _ ) ipc pointings .",
    "our optical / ir observations of one of the candidates reveal ir variability of 0.5 mag and persistent balmer emission , with a redshift consistent with smc membership .",
    "the ubvri colours and optical spectra of both candidates indicate an early b - spectral type .    in 1997",
    "november , following our observations , an x - ray source identified as xte j0053 - 724 went into outburst and revealed a 46 s x - ray pulsation ( corbet et al .",
    "though originally , and incorrectly , identified as smc x-3 , subsequent asca observations in 1997 december revealed that the pulsating source was actually 8 away from smc x-3 , establishing it to be a new x - ray pulsar .",
    "its new asca - determined position is coincident with the previously catalogued x - ray source and the data we present here confirms this association and provides convincing evidence that it is a be / neutron star binary .",
    "the wga catalogue ( white , giommi , angelini 1994 ) was generated using all pointed rosat pspc data available in the archive up to 1994 november and its first revision includes data up to 1995 march .",
    "the catalogue was created using the rev1 rosat data files , where data taken several months apart belonging to the same sequence were combined in one file .",
    "a variability test for each detected source was included as part of the processing .",
    "the method used compares the time arrival distribution of the photons collected in each pixel with the corresponding distribution of the entire image using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( giommi , angelini , white 1995 ) . the transient nature of was discovered using this method , in the sequence 600195 , which included data from 1991 october and 1992 april .",
    "the source was detected in 1992 april at coordinates r.a.=00@xmath4 and dec=@xmath5 ( j2000 ) .",
    "positional errors from the wga positions vary from @xmath6 , depending how far the source is off - axis .    after discovering the transient behaviour ,",
    "the rosat public archive was searched for additional pspc and hri public data containing the source position .",
    "table 1 gives the observation log together with the nominal exposure , the off - axis position of the source in the hri or pspc field of view measured from the nominal pointing , and the count rate .    a count rate ( or upper limit )",
    "is given in table 1 for most of the observations with the following caveats .",
    "for a large off - axis angle , the point spread function ( psf ) is very large : at 50 arcmins the 50% power radius is @xmath7 arcmins ( see rosat handbook ) .",
    "that far off - axis , the source position is typically at the detector boundary and the optimized radius falls outside the detector image , resulting in an underestimate of the countrate .",
    "is at @xmath8  5 arcmin from another transient rx j0054.9 - 7210 ( kahabka and pietsch 1996 ) , which is also an _ einstein _ ipc source : no . 9 in bruhweiler",
    "et al ( 1987 ) and no . 35 in wang and wu ( 1992 ) . at such large off - axis angles ,",
    "if this second source was active , the optimized radius to evaluate the count rate for is contaminated by emission from rxj0054.9 - 7210 .",
    "for these observations no count rate or upper limits are given in table 1 , although a column indicates whether was detected ( ` on ' or ` off ' ) .",
    "0.99    the source is highly variable and it was detected in 1992 april ( pspc ) , 1993 october ( pspc ) , and 1996 june ( hri ) . although the coverage is not complete , the outbursts for the 1992 april and 1993 october observations last more than a month .",
    "figure 1 shows the background subtracted lightcurve for the 1992 april outburst combining data from the sequence 600195 and 600196 , where only the declining phase is seen . the pspc spectrum obtained for the 1992 april observation ( only when the source is at @xmath9 arcmin off - axis , because of the response uncertainties at large off - axis angles ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we fit the spectrum using a power law and absorption .",
    "the best fit parameter values are a spectral index of 1.6 with an equivalent hydrogen absorption of @xmath10  @xmath11 ( shown in figure 2 ) , but these two parameters can not be simultaneously constrained .",
    "a model with a fixed absorption at the galactic value in the smc direction ( @xmath12  @xmath11 ) and a power law , overestimates the low energy part of the spectrum . if 1wga j0053.8 - 7226 is a be star , as argued later , it is reasonable to assume that the outburst spectrum should be similar to that of 1wga j0051.8 - 7231 ,",

    "this value seems consistent with the contour map in kahabka & pietsch ( 1996 ) where is close to source number 103 in their paper .",

    "0.99    the 1996 june hri observation allowed us to derive a better position because of the higher hri angular resolution compared to the pspc , and because the source location is at a smaller off - axis angle ( @xmath7  arcmins ) compare to the pspc observations . at equinox 2000",

    "spectra in the interval 3300 - 7500 , at a resolution of 7 , were obtained using the reticon photon counting system ( rpcs ) . because the two components of star a were separated by only a few arcsec in the e - w direction , it was impossible to get separate spectra of the two .",

    "although the rpcs is only a 1d detector , it was possible to determine which of the two stars was responsible for the balmer emission .",
    "this was done by driving the stellar image off to one extreme of the slit decker , thereby excluding most of the light of the companion .",
    "the exercise was then repeated for the other star .",
    "it was therefore possible to obtain two spectra , whose major light contribution was one or other of the two stars . from these observations we were able to show that the fainter , easternmost , star was the h@xmath1 emitter . this has been subsequently confirmed from both optical photometry and ccd spectroscopy , reported later in this paper .    0.99    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.99    0.99    the remaining stars observed in , or near , the error circle are very unlikely to be the counterpart to the x - ray source .",

    "apart from h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and the other balmer lines ( seen in absorption h@xmath3 , h@xmath56 , h@xmath57 , h8 ) , there appears to be no other significant features in the spectra of stars a and b. regrettably the s / n ratio of the spectrum is insufficient to obtain further spectral typing information .    however , for the be component of star a we can use the contemporaneous optical and ir photometry from 1995 november to model the spectral shape . assuming a value of e(b  v ) = 0.15 , we de - reddened our data and fitted a kurucz model atmosphere to the photometry . normalizing the model to our u band point results in an acceptable fit for t = 22000 2000 k and log_g _ = 4.0 .",
    "this fit is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , from which the ir excess over the stellar model is clearly visible .",
    "this temperature range corresponds to a b1-b2 spectral type .",
    "unfortunately we have no ir data for star b to demonstrate that the ir excess for that object also exists .",
    "however , the ( u  b ) and ( b  v ) optical colours are very similar to those of star b indicating a similar spectral type .    in the case of the be star component to star a membership of the smc is clearly established .",
    "hence we can estimate the absolute magnitude of this system using the observed apparent _ v _ magnitude in table 2 , correcting for an assumed absorption of _",
    "e(b  v ) _ 0.2 , implying an @xmath58 0.6",
    ". this gives @xmath59 14.3 , and for a distance modulus of @xmath60 ( westerlund 1997 ) , implies @xmath61 = 4.6 .",
    "this suggests a luminosity class iii - v .",
    "for the nearby contaminating f2 star , the absolute magnitude is estimate to be @xmath62 = 4.8 to 5.4 , respectively , for an @xmath63 in the range 0.0 to 0.2 .",
    "this star is therefore most likely a supergiant f - star .",
    "the degree of reddening seems consistent with the column density , @xmath64 , determined from the _ rosat _ observations .",
    "an @xmath65 of 0.15 implies a column of @xmath66 , which compares favourably with the value obtained from the x - ray spectrum ( section 2 ) , namely @xmath67 .",
    "these column densities are all much larger than the column density to the smc ( @xmath68 ) , implying a local source of reddening consistent with a circumstellar disk around the be star .    in section 2",
    "we estimated the unabsorbed 0.12.0 kev x - ray flux as 7.5 @xmath69 . using the same power - law model , we calculate the unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev flux as 3.2 @xmath69 , which we use to determine the luminosity ratio , @xmath70 : @xmath71 , the ratio used by bradt & mcclintock ( 1983 ) in their survey of x - ray source optical counterparts .",
    "our estimate of @xmath72 2 @xmath73 for star a comes from the optical spectrum ( fig .",
    "4 ) , where we integrated the flux over the interval 4000 - 7000 , and extrapolated linearly to 3000 .",
    "the derived @xmath74 (= @xmath75 ) ratio of 0.010.02 is very typical of hmxrbs , and the more active be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the ratio is some 4 orders of magnitude greater than that expected from pure coronal emission from early type stars ( caillault & helfand 1985 ) , and consistent with accretion powered x - ray emission .",
    "the inferred luminosity of , @xmath76 ( 2 - 10kev ) = 1.6@xmath77 ergs s@xmath18 , is lower than x - ray `` high - state '' luminosities often seen in transient be / x - ray systems , which are typically in the range @xmath78 .",
    "the value is far more typical of the quiescent luminosity produced by stellar wind accretion ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that does not appear in the _ rosat _ hri survey of the smc ( cowley et al .",
    "an upper limit of 0.001 cts s@xmath18 was placed on the flux , whereas it was expected to be 0.007 cts s@xmath18 based on the _ einstein _ count rate reported in wang and wu ( 1992 ) .",

    "is clearly a transient source , with excellent _ bona fides _ for a be / neutron star system . the x - ray , optical and ir variability ( at least for one candidate ) , combined with the 92 s x - ray pulse period ( corbet et al .",
    "1997 ) , convincingly demonstrates that is a be / neutron star binary system , though we are unable to distinguish between the two possible optical counterparts at this stage .",
    "only if correlated optical / x - ray variability is seen , or a much more accurate x - ray position determined , will this point be resolved .",
    "this makes it the @xmath79 such system discovered in the smc , following the discovery of rx j0117.67330 ( clark , remillard and woo 1997 and coe et al 1998 ) .",
    "we also note that a significant number of x - ray pulsars have recently been discovered in this region of the smc .",

    "we have identified the optical counterparts to these x - ray pulsars to be smc be stars through similar optical programs as described here ( stevens , coe and buckley , 1999 ) .",
