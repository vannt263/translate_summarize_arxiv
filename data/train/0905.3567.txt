    "psr  j1846@xmath00258  is a young ( @xmath2800yr ) , 326ms pulsar , discovered in 2000 with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "no radio pulsations have been detected despite deep searches @xcite .",
    "psr  j1846@xmath00258  has a large inferred magnetic field of @xmath3 g , above the quantum critical limit , and a braking index of @xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lkgk06 ) .",
    "the pulsar was therefore believed to be simply a high - magnetic field rotation - powered pulsar ( rpp ) , with radio pulsations that do not cross our line of sight .",
    "however , in 2006 may , the source experienced a series of x - ray bursts and a sudden increase in x - ray flux , which strongly suggest magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "the source also showed spectral variations and changes in the surrounding nebula @xcite .",
    "a magnetar is a neutron star whose magnetic energy powers the bulk of its emission @xcite , while a rpp produces radiation via the loss of rotational kinetic energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "psr  j1846@xmath00258  is a unique transition object between these two source classes .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of psr  j1846@xmath00258  can be entirely accounted for by the spin - down power of the pulsar , however , the observed x - ray bursts and flux flare are phenomena only seen thus far from magnetars @xcite .",
    "a neutron star glitch is defined as a sudden , usually unresolved , increase in spin frequency , @xmath5 .",
    "glitches are often accompanied by an increase in the frequency derivative , @xmath6 , and are sometimes followed by an exponential decay on timescale @xmath7 , where some of the initial jump in @xmath5 is recovered . in general , a glitch at time @xmath8 can be modeled as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the frequency of the pulsar prior to the glitch and @xmath11 is the initial frequency jump , which can be decomposed into the part of the glitch that is permanent , @xmath12 , and that which decays , @xmath13 .",
    "the recovery fraction is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the variety of observed pulsar glitches is interesting .",
    "the fractional magnitude of the observed change in @xmath5 ranges over 6 orders of magnitude from @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "some glitches are characterized only by a @xmath5 increase ( e.g. , psr b1758@xmath023 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while some glitches ( typically in young pulsars ) are dominated by an increase in the magnitude of @xmath6 ( e.g. , the crab pulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "some glitches decay on timescales of @xmath2days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others display very long decay time scales ( @xmath2 hundreds of days ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of the glitch that decays is also highly variable . in older pulsars",
    "the amount of glitch recovery is typically small ( @xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while in the crab pulsar the recovery can be nearly complete ( e.g. , @xmath17 , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in many glitches , no recovery is detected .",
    "glitches are now known to be ubiquitous in magnetars as well as rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "what remains to be seen is whether glitches have the same physical origin in both types of objects , or if the super - critical magnetic fields of magnetars are responsible for different glitch origins and evolutions .",
    "while some magnetar glitches are indistinguishable from those observed in rpps , others occur contemporaneously with radiative changes such as bursts , flux enhancements , and spectral or pulse profile variations , such as in the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "no radiative changes have been observed with rpp glitches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "rpp glitches are believed to arise from a sudden unpinning of vortices in the superfluid interior crust of the pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "magnetar glitches , on the other hand , may be triggered by strong internal magnetic fields as the crust is deformed , either plastically or cracked violently @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the timing behavior of psr  j1846@xmath00258  prior to , during , and following the period of magnetic activity observed in 2006 .",
    "we show that a large glitch occurred contemporaneous with the x - ray bursts and onset of the flux flare , accompanied by an unusual increase in the timing noise of the pulsar .",
    "we show that the glitch recovery is very unusual for a rpp but is reminiscent of timing behavior observed from magnetars and is further evidence of magnetic activity in psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258  were made using the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) on board _",
    "rxte_. the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the 2    60kev range , with a total effective area of approximately @xmath18 and a field of view of @xmath19  fwhm .",
    "our entire _ rxte _",
    "data set spans 9.7yr from 1999 april 18 through 2008 december 10 ( mjd 51286  54810 ) .",
    "data from 2000 january 31 - 2005 july 27 ( mjd 51574  53578 ) were reduced and analyzed previously and details can be found in lkgk06 .",
    "eleven observations taken in 1999 april 18 - 21 are of limited use for the current analysis since they can not be unambiguously phase connected to the rest of the data .",
    "analysis of data spanning 2005 july 27 - 2008 december 10 ( mjd 53578  54810 ) is presented here .",
    "data were collected in `` goodxenon '' mode , which records the arrival time ( with 1-@xmath20s resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of every unrejected event . typically , two to three pcus were operational during an observation .",
    "we used the first xenon layer of each operational pcu and extracted events in channels 4    48 ( approximately 2  ",
    "20kev ) , as this maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio for this source .",
    "observations were downloaded from the heasarc archive and data from each active pcu were merged and binned at ( 1/1024)s resolution .",
    "photon arrival times were converted to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the j2000 source position ra = @xmath21 , decl @xmath22 @xcite and the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris .",
    "the known ephemeris from lkgk06 was used to fold each time series with 16 phase bins .",
    "resulting profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise ratio template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from all observations .",
    "the cross - correlation process assumes that the pulse profile is stable ; indeed , we found no evidence for variability that could bias toa measurement , as shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the figure shows average profiles from before , after , and throughout the outburst and unusual timing behavior . for each individual observation ,",
    "the cross - correlation yielded the time of arrival ( toa ) of phase - zero of the average pulse profile at the fold epoch .",
    "the toas were fitted to a timing model ( see section [ sec : timing ] ) using the pulsar timing software package tempo .",
    "after phase - connecting the data , we merged observations occurring on a single day and used the ephemeris to re - fold the data in order to obtain more precise toas .",
    "this process produced 199 toas with a typical uncertainty @xmath29ms ( @xmath22.7% of the pulse period ) .",
    "further details of the observation and analysis are given in lkgk06 .",
    "phase - coherent timing is a powerful method for obtaining accurate pulsar parameters , but can only be used when timing noise and glitches are relatively small ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . to obtain a phase - coherent timing solution , each turn of the pulsar is accounted for by fitting toas with a taylor expansion of the pulse phase @xcite .    phase - coherent timing for psr  j1846@xmath00258  spanning 2000 january 1  2005",
    "july 27 ( mjd",
    "5157453578 ) is discussed in lkgk06 .",
    "phase coherence was maintained for the next 308 days without incident .",
    "phase coherence was lost with the observation occurring on 2006 may 31 ( mjd  53886 ) which contained 4 x - ray bursts and a pulse flux increase @xcite . for the following 32 observations spanning 192 days , no unambiguous phase coherent timing solution was possible .",
    "instead , we performed periodograms to determine the pulse frequency .",
    "uncertainties were determined from a monte carlo simulation , where noise was added to simulated sinusoidal pulses and the frequency for each trial was determined in the same way as for the real data ( see lkgk06 for further details ) .",
    "phase coherence was once again obtained starting 2007 january 26 ( mjd  54126 ) with closely spaced bootstrapping observations after the source reappeared from behind the sun after 48 days .",
    "a single phase coherent timing solution was obtained spanning 2007 january 26  2008 december 10 ( mjd  5412654810 ) .",
    "this timing solution is severely contaminated by long - term glitch recovery and timing noise , so the fitted parameters for the global solution are of limited value .    to analyze the long - term rotational behavior of the pulsar , we created short phase - coherent timing solutions from 2000 until the onset of bursts , and from 2007 and 2008 .",
    "each timing solution included only @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and included as much data as possible while requiring the reduced @xmath23 value of the fit to be @xmath21 .",
    "this resulted in 11 measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 pre - glitch and 11 measurements post - glitch . in order to better utilize the available data in the post - glitch period",
    ", we created short overlapping timing solutions , each of which uses approximately half the data from two of the above described short data subsets , and has the same fitted parameters and @xmath23 requirements .",
    "this can be useful because the short coherent timing solutions result in parameter fits that are dominated by the end points , which can be problematic when @xmath5 is varying rapidly from glitch recovery as in this case , or when timing noise is a significant effect .",
    "this produces an additional 9 post - glitch measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "coherent frequency measurements ( crosses ) , overlapping frequency measurements ( filled circles ) and frequency measurements obtained via periodograms ( open circles ) , are plotted in the top panel of figure  [ fig : freq ] , with the pre - burst @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath24 removed .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : freq ] shows measurements of @xmath6 from the short coherent timing solutions as crosses , with the overlapping @xmath6 measurements in filled circles .",
    "in addition , open circles show three measurements of @xmath6 that are calculated from weighted least - squares fits to nine periodogram measurements of @xmath5 .",
    "a frequency increase is apparent in the frequency residual plot ( top panel and inset , figure  [ fig : freq ] ) , indicating that a glitch occurred ( also noted by * ? ? ?",
    "two measurements of @xmath5 are larger than the pre - glitch predicted value .",
    "we calculated the average @xmath25 at mjd  53890 ( 4    11days after the glitch occurred ) .",
    "the initial value of @xmath11 at the time of the glitch was presumably larger than this value , as indicated by the exponential fit to the data discussed below .",
    "we fitted the measured frequencies of psr  j1846@xmath00258  ( fitting only 3 pre - glitch @xmath5 values ) with an exponential recovery glitch model ( eq .",
    "1 ) , the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig : glitchresids ] .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows frequency measurements with the pre - glitch ephemeris ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath24 ) removed ( as in figure  [ fig : freq ] ) , while the bottom panel shows residuals from the glitch fit .",
    "the uncertainties from the periodogram measurements of @xmath5 are @xmath26 orders of magnitude larger than those from short coherent fits to the data and thus contribute minimally to the overall @xmath23 value .",
    "thus the glitch residuals ( bottom panel , figure  [ fig : glitchresids ] ) are shown to highlight the deviation from the fit of the coherent frequencies , which dominate the @xmath23 .",
    "significant deviations from the fit can be seen during the period of glitch recovery , giving rise to a large reduced @xmath23 value of @xmath27 for 45 degrees of freedom for the best fit ( bottom panel , figure  [ fig : glitchresids ] ) .",
    "given the poor fit , the formal uncertainties underestimate the true values .",
    "to determine more reasonable uncertainties on the glitch parameters , we multiplied the uncertainties on the coherent @xmath5 measurements by a factor until the reduced @xmath23 of the fit @xmath28 .",
    "we applied a multiplicative factor only to the phase coherent @xmath5 measurements because these uncertainties were @xmath29 orders of magnitude smaller than those from periodogram @xmath5 measurements , determined in a different way , and the contribution to @xmath23 was mainly from the coherent @xmath5 values .",
    "quoted uncertainties on the glitch parameters are from @xmath30 contours from the fit with multiplied uncertainties .",
    "the fitted value of the initial fractional frequency increase is @xmath31 , very large for such a young pulsar , where a typical value is @xmath32 .",
    "more remarkable yet , however , is the amount by which the frequency recovers .",
    "we find @xmath33 , corresponding to a net decrease in frequency of @xmath34hz .",
    "all fitted glitch parameters are given in table  [ table : glitch ] .    while the deviation from the exponential fit is very significant for several months ( bottom panel , figure  [ fig : glitchresids ] ) the overall evolution after the glitch",
    "is dominated by the exponential recovery : the deviation from the fit is @xmath22 orders of magnitude smaller than the overall post - glitch decrease in @xmath5 .",
    "the deviation from exponential recovery may well have been larger in the period just following the glitch , however , the large uncertainties on the periodogram measurements of @xmath5 ( @xmath35hz ) prevent any firm conclusion .",
    "however , since the corresponding pulse toas can not be unambiguously phase - connected , it is likely that large variations in @xmath5 and @xmath6 occurred during the 240-day period between the glitch epoch and when we regained phase - coherence .",
    "it is also possible that a second , smaller glitch ( @xmath36 ) occurred during this period .",
    "the observed deviation from the exponential recovery decreases as the glitch recovers .",
    "thus , in the closing months of 2008 , the pulsar was rotating very regularly again , similar to its pre - glitch behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : nudot ] shows post - glitch phase - coherent measurements of @xmath6 ( a subset of the @xmath6 measurements shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : freq ] ) .",
    "the pre - glitch measurements are excluded here for clarity .",
    "the solid line is the derivative of the glitch model fitted to the @xmath5 measurements , clearly showing that there is significant deviation .",
    "the overall effect of the glitch recovery on @xmath6 is clear , however , from mjd 54100 - 54300 the @xmath6 measurements deviate from the exponential recovery by @xmath37% .",
    "the effect of this anomalous change in @xmath6 is not directly evident in the measurements of @xmath5 ( which are dominated by the exponential recovery ) but does help explain why the exponential glitch fit is not a satisfactory description of the data , and is clear in the residuals of the glitch fit in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : freq ] .",
    "the glitch during psr  j1846@xmath00258 s outburst was accompanied by a major pulsed flux enhancement @xcite . in order to quantify the radiative properties of the source during the glitch recovery , we extracted its pulsed flux using all available _ rxte _  observations .",
    "first , we generated separate event lists for each pcu in fits format using the standard ` ftools ` .",
    "we then filtered our event lists such that we only preserved photons in the 2  ",
    "20kev band , from the first xenon layer .",
    "the photon arrival times were then barycented using the source position and the jpl de200 solar system ephemeris .",
    "we folded the filtered barycented photon arrival times using the ephemeris determined in our phase - coherent timing analysis using 16 phase bins . using the folded profiles , we calculated the rms pulsed flux in each pcu using the fourier method described by @xcite keeping only the contribution from the 1st harmonic given the source s roughly sinusoidal profile .",
    "not all the observations were pointed at psr  j1846@xmath00258 , therefore we corrected for the reduced efficiency in each pcu due to the offset pointing using the collimator response of each pcu and the instrument attitude files . finally , we averaged the pulsed flux in each pcu weighted by the fractional exposure of each pcu .",
    "we excluded the contribution from pcu 0 because of the loss of its propane layer and the numerous detector breakdown events .",
    "our pulsed flux time series is presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : freq ] .",
    "the event lists for each pcu created for the pulsed flux analysis were binned into 31.25  ms lightcurves and were searched for bursts using the burst search algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "no additional bursts were found other than the 5 reported in @xcite .",
    "we checked for a correlation between torque and pulsed flux by plotting the pulsed flux against the spin frequency derivative in log - log space , shown in figure  [ fig : torqueflux ] .",
    "all measurements of @xmath6 before and after the glitch and bursts are shown , including 3 measurements of @xmath6 obtained from weighted least - squares fits to @xmath5 measurements obtained from periodograms .",
    "these 3 @xmath6 measurements have uncertainties @xmath26 orders of magnitude larger than those for @xmath6 measurements from coherent timing .",
    "the plot shows a possible correlation between flux and torque when both parameters are extreme . fitting a power law to the data gives a power law index of @xmath28 .",
    "however , this value is constrained by a single measurement of @xmath6 when the flux , and timing noise , are both very large . excluding this point ,",
    "there is no significant correlation between flux and @xmath6 .",
    "the observed variations in @xmath6 during the later phase connected period , are at the @xmath38 level , while the variation in @xmath6 immediately following the glitch are at the @xmath39 level ( figure  [ fig : nudot ] ) .",
    "correspondingly small fluctuations in pulsed flux are not detectable in these data .",
    "four x - ray bursts in psr  j1846@xmath00258  coincided with the onset of a flux flare on 2006 may 31 ( mjd 53886 ) .",
    "the pulsed flux decayed over @xmath22 months and reached quiescence around the time of the fifth burst on 2006 july 27 ( mjd 53943 ) @xcite .",
    "significant spectral changes also occurred @xcite and flux enhancement up to 300kev was observed @xcite .",
    "contemporaneous with the sudden change in the x - ray emission from psr  j1846@xmath00258 , we observed a large glitch with an initial frequency increase of @xmath40 .",
    "the glitch decayed over @xmath41days , with a recovery fraction of @xmath33 , resulting in a net decrease of the pulse frequency of @xmath42hz .",
    "furthermore , the timing behavior during the period of recovery is not well modeled by a simple exponential function and measurements of @xmath6 in particular are suggestive of a high level of timing noise for several hundred days following the glitch .",
    "this glitch and subsequent recovery reinforces that psr  j1846@xmath00258  underwent a period of magnetic activity in 2006 .",
    "this glitch is entirely different from the previous glitch in this source , which was radiatively silent , small in magnitude ( @xmath43 ) , dominated by a change in @xmath6 ( @xmath44 ) , and had no measurable recovery ( lkgk06 ) .",
    "this small glitch is similar to those observed in the crab pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other very young rotation - powered pulsars such as psr  b0540@xmath069 @xcite .",
    "it is unusual to have two such disparate initial @xmath11 magnitudes in the same source , particularly in such a young pulsar , though this has been seen in some older pulsars such as psr  b1737@xmath030 , which has glitch magnitudes spanning four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in fact , the glitch reported here is the largest glitch ever observed in any of the pulsars with characteristic ages less than @xmath45kyr ( the crab pulsar , b0540@xmath069 , b1509@xmath059 , and j1119@xmath06127 ) , none of which have experienced glitches with fractional magnitudes larger than @xmath32 .",
    "the glitch reported here has a recovery fraction of @xmath46 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath47 implies that the net frequency change after the glitch recovery is negative , @xmath48 , as shown in figure  [ fig : freq ] .",
    "a similar effect was recently observed in the axp 4u 0142 + 61 , though with much smaller magnitude of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the negative change in @xmath5 resulting from the over - recovery of the psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch is similar in magnitude to the unresolved timing event seen in the magnetar sgr 1900 + 14 in the months before the giant flare in 1998 @xcite . in that case , an enhanced spin - down of the magnetar was observed over @xmath23 months .",
    "well spaced timing observations around the time of the timing event were not available , so no glitch could be resolved , if indeed one occurred .",
    "@xcite attribute the observed behavior in sgr 1900 + 14 to one of two possibilities .",
    "the first is an increase in the magnitude of @xmath6 by a factor of @xmath50 , persisting for @xmath51days .",
    "the second is that a negative glitch , that is , a sudden spin - down occurred , with magnitude @xmath52 .",
    "however , a timing event similar to that observed in psr  j1846@xmath00258   could also describe the data .",
    "it is curious , however , that such similar fractional changes in @xmath5 should occur in two sources that experienced such disparate radiative changes , with the energy output from sgr  1900 + 14 being several orders of magnitude larger than from psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "axp 1e  2259 + 586 experienced a glitch contemporaneous with 80 x - ray bursts , a flux flare and pulse profile changes in 2002 @xcite .",
    "neither this glitch nor the large psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch can be described with a single exponential decay model .",
    "the addition of an exponential growth component better describes the 1e 2259 + 586 glitch , however , the addition of a similar component for the psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch does not provide a significant improvement to the fit .",
    "interestingly , the flux enhancement observed in 1e  2259 + 586 lasted much longer ( @xmath53yr ; * ? ? ? * ) than the glitch recovery time scale ( @xmath54days ) , whereas the reverse is true for psr  j1846@xmath00258 , with @xmath55days and a flux decay timescale of @xmath56days @xcite .",
    "the 1e  2259 + 586 event can also be distinguished from the psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch in that its recovery fraction is much smaller , with @xmath57 .",
    "in 2001 , the axp 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 also experienced a glitch with recovery that was not well described by a simple exponential , and not improved with the addition of a second exponential term @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that it is unlikely that 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 experienced bursts or a pulsed flux flare associated with this glitch because a flux flare would have had to decay on a time scale less than the glitch decay time scale .",
    "however , this is exactly the behavior observed from psr  j1846@xmath00258 , albeit with a much longer time scale .",
    "long - term spectral changes and flux variations have been claimed in 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 @xcite .",
    "an interesting characteristic of some axp glitches is a period of enhanced spin - down immediately following the glitch , as observed in 1e  1841@xmath0045 , 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and 1e",
    "2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "the additional instantaneous spin - down at the glitch epoch owing to the exponential recovery can be quantified as @xmath58 ( found by taking the derivative of the exponential term in eq . 1 and setting @xmath59 ) .",
    "for the 1e  2259 + 586 glitch , @xmath60 , while a typical value for a rpp is @xmath61 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references contained therein ) . for psr  j1846@xmath00258  the instantaneous spin - down is @xmath62 , larger than for any rpp glitch , but not as large as those measured for axps .",
    "it should be noted , however , that an enhanced spin - down is not observed in every axp glitch .    in psr  j1846@xmath00258",
    ", there is evidence for a @xmath2200-day interval where @xmath6 deviates significantly from an exponential glitch recovery , and it is possible that further significant deviation occurred during the 240-day period of unconnected data directly following the glitch . perhaps @xmath6 is varying in a stochastic fashion similar to that observed in the axp 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 @xcite .",
    "in this axp , a @xmath2year - long period of rapid @xmath6 variations followed a large pulsed flux flare and a possible glitch in 2002 .",
    "another glitch in 2007 coincided with the onset of a pulsed - flux flare , again followed by stochastic variations in @xmath6 .",
    "another similarity between these sources is that the flux enhancement decayed away long before the timing variations subsided .",
    "alternatively , perhaps the variations are more simply attributed to timing noise , as is seen in many young rpps .",
    "the behavior remains unusual however , since this is qualitatively very different from the mild timing noise observed in psr  j1846@xmath00258prior to magnetic activity , and such a large change in timing noise behavior is unprecedented among rpps .",
    "a simple estimate of the transfer of rotational kinetic energy at the time of the glitch can be obtained by treating the star as a solid rotating body .",
    "assuming the canonical neutron star moment of inertia of @xmath63g@xmath64 , the energy deposited in the solid crust at the time of the glitch owing to the increase in @xmath5 is @xmath65ergs .",
    "however , it is well established that neutron stars are comprised of at least two components , a solid crust coupled to the core and a loosely coupled superfluid component in the crust .",
    "taking the two - component model into account but not making any further assumptions about the nature of the two components , we can calculate the energy transferred between the components at the time of the glitch .",
    "the first constraint is that angular momentum is conserved , that is , @xmath66 where @xmath11 is the observed increase in spin - frequency , and @xmath67 is the unknown change in spin - frequency of the superfluid , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the moment of inertia of the solid crust and core , and superfluid , respectively .",
    "an estimate of the energy contained in the glitch can then be calculated as @xmath70 the frequency lag between the crust and superfluid can be estimated from the glitch decay time , @xmath7 , as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the characteristic age of the pulsar @xcite . for psr  j1846@xmath00258 ,",
    "the frequency lag is @xmath73hz , giving a glitch energy of @xmath74ergs for the measured glitch parameters ( see table  [ table : glitch ] ) . if the measured glitch decay timescale , @xmath7 , in this case is dominated by processes external to the neutron star ( as discussed in section  [ sec : magglitchdisc ] ) , any other glitch decay timescale would occur on a shorter timescale than the one observed , so this estimate of the frequency lag and thus glitch energy can be considered an upper limit .    for a distance to the pulsar of 6kpc @xcite the energy estimated to have been released in the bursts and flux",
    "flare , assuming isotropic emission , is @xmath75ergs ( 2  ",
    "a new estimate of the distance to the pulsar of @xmath210kpc @xcite increases the amount of energy contained in the radiative outburst to @xmath76ergs ( 2  ",
    "for either distance , the energy contained in the radiative outburst is several orders of magnitude larger than that contained in the glitch .",
    "this is similar to the bursts and glitch from 1e  2259 + 586 , for which the energy contained in the glitch was @xmath22 orders of magnitude less than the energy contained in the bursts and flux flare @xcite .",
    "this is suggestive that the glitch alone is not responsible for the radiative outburst , in contrast to the argument put forward by @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence for this event ( or in any other similar axp event ) that the glitch preceded the radiative event .",
    "this could be tested only by sensitive continuous x - ray monitoring of this and other similar sources .",
    "rotation - powered pulsar glitches are thought to arise from differential rotation in the neutron star , where the crust contains superfluid neutrons rotating more rapidly than the surrounding matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the angular momentum of a rotating superfluid is quantized in vortices which are thought to become pinned to nuclei in the star s crust .",
    "the vortex lines are therefore under extreme stresses due to the differential rotation between the crust and the superfluid .",
    "it is thought that the vortex lines experience sudden unpinning , resulting in the transfer of angular momentum to the crust , observed as an increase in the spin - frequency of the neutron star .",
    "magnetar glitches may instead be triggered by strong internal magnetic fields as the crust is deformed , either plastically or cracked violently @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by the large number of glitches now observed to occur at the same epoch as magnetically powered radiative events , such as bursts and flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physics underlying glitches with @xmath47 is unclear",
    ". the classical glitch model of vortex unpinning in the superfluid crust of the neutron star does not readily produce such dramatic glitch recoveries .",
    "one possibility is that some parts of the superfluid are in fact rotating more slowly than the crust . then the initial @xmath5 increase would be from a transfer of angular momentum from a more rapidly rotating region of the superfluid to the crust , which is then followed by a transfer of angular momentum from the crust to the more sluggish region of the superfluid .",
    "this is the explanation put forward by @xcite to explain the net spin - down event in sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "they argue that regions of slowly rotating superfluid can occur in magnetars because vortex motion is dominated by advection across the neutron star surface by the deforming crust and that gradual plastic deformation of the neutron star crust will cause the superfluid to rotate more slowly than the crust .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such behavior is expected in a neutron star with a magnetic field of @xmath77 g , spinning relatively rapidly compared to the magnetars .    that the recovery of the psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch so far overshoots the initial frequency increase is suggestive of an external torque following the glitch .",
    "previous evidence for an external torque includes the large fraction of @xmath78 implied to have decoupled in the 1e  2259 + 586 glitch .",
    "however , this may also be explained with a core glitch , that is , where the core of the pulsar ( and thus a large fraction of @xmath78 ) decouples temporarily from the crust @xcite . in psr",
    "j1846@xmath00258 , however , the post - glitch relaxation amplitude is much greater than the initial glitch amplitude , offering support for the idea that the post - glitch spin - down behavior results from an external source .",
    "one possibility is that a magnetic field twist responsible for the x - ray bursts and flux enhancement also affects the spin - down of the pulsar . in this case",
    "the observed recovery is driven by the propagation of magnetic field untwisting ( similar to a shock wave ) through the magnetosphere . during this process , the spin - down of the star may increase because the effective magnetic field has increased .",
    "when the `` shock '' reaches the light cylinder , which can take place on few month time scales , the spin - down should return to its pre - burst value @xcite .",
    "this theory also allows for non - monotonic behavior in the spin - down after an event , as observed in both axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 @xcite and psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "this model allows for a delay between flux variations and the onset of timing variability , as was observed in 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , though not observed in psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "however , as in the model of variably rotating superfluid , it is not immediately clear how the more rapid rotation and smaller magnetic field affect the relevance of this model . in particular ,",
    "the different light cylinder radii of psr  j1846@xmath00258  compared to the axps should result in different shock propagation times .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that fallback disks from the supernova explosion creating the neutron star could be interacting with magnetars and be responsible for some of the observed emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , the initial x - ray bursts could irradiate a fossil disk commencing a period of disk activity .",
    "the interaction between the neutron star and a disk could cause the enhanced spin - down , which would decay as the disk cooled .",
    "however , in the framework of this model , it is difficult to understand how accretion causing variations in the spin - down rate could continue for so much longer than the pulsed - flux enhancement .",
    "another rpp , psr  j1119@xmath06127 , has very similar spin properties to psr  j1846@xmath00258 .",
    "its @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath72 are all similar , and notably , it has a similarly large magnetic field of @xmath81 g @xcite .",
    "this pulsar has shown some indication of unusual x - ray emission .",
    "no magnetospheric x - ray emission is detected , but thermal pulsations with a @xmath82 pulsed fraction and a large surface temperature are detected @xcite .",
    "no direct evidence of magnetic activity ( i.e. bursts or flux enhancements ) is present in this pulsar . given the similarities between psr  j1119@xmath06127 and psr  j1846@xmath00258 , both sources , as well as other high b - field rpps are currently being monitored with _ rxte _",
    "for similar magnetic activity .",
    "psr  j1846@xmath00258  may be related to the transient axps ( taxps ) .",
    "psr  j1846@xmath00258appears to be a typical rpp for @xmath83 of the time , with brief periods of magnetic activity occurring approximately once a decade .",
    "the taxp xte  j1810@xmath0197 increased in brightness by a factor of @xmath2100 and was subsequently visible for several years as a pulsed x - ray source @xcite .",
    "another taxp , 1e  1547@xmath05408 was detected as a pulsed radio source after an x - ray outburst in which the flux increased by at least a factor of 16 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both xte  j1810@xmath0197 and 1e  1547@xmath05408 , two _ bona fide _ taxps , are the only two magnetars with detected radio pulsations .",
    "by contrast , no radio pulsations have been detected from psr  j1846@xmath00258despite extensive searches both before and after the magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "in _ rxte _  observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258 , we have observed a large glitch with an unusual quasi - exponential over - recovery of @xmath5 and substantial timing noise contemporaneous with x - ray bursts and a flux increase .",
    "these observations strengthen the tie between magnetic activity in neutron stars and unusual glitch activity , as has been previously noted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a glitch with recovery fraction @xmath47 has never before been observed from a rotation - powered pulsar and is not compatible with the standard model of pulsar glitches .",
    "the unusually large glitch recovery reported here for psr  j1846@xmath00258 , as well as the radiative changes occurring contemporaneously with the psr  j1846@xmath00258  glitch and several axp glitches , together provide the best evidence that there are physical differences between typical rpp glitches and some glitches observed in magnetars .",
    "ongoing timing observations of psr  j1846@xmath00258  are required to obtain a deterministic post - outburst braking index measurement that is uncontaminated by long - term glitch recovery .",
    "a measurement of the braking index for this source after outburst is of considerable interest as a change would strongly suggest that a magnetic reconfiguration occurred at the time of the outburst .",
