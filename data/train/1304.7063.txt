    "substitutions in differential operators now referred to as darboux transformations were already known to euler and laplace .",
    "darboux  @xcite pioneered their application ( his terminology was `` les expressions @xmath0 '' ) for studying surfaces .",
    "these transformations were rediscovered in 1970s in integrable systems theory and applied to kdv type non - linear partial differential equations that can be presented in the lax or zero curvature form ( ` soliton equations ' ) .",
    "deep results on darboux transformations have been obtained by many prominent mathematicians , in particular , s.  tsarev , s.  novikov , a.  mikhailov , p.  olver , and a.  veselov  @xcite .    in the early period of integrable systems",
    "theory , particular cases of darboux transformations were used for obtaining exact solutions with remarkable properties for the nonlinear equations from solutions of the corresponding linear problems .",
    "the known application of darboux transformation is for the 1d and 2d ( 1 and 2 spatial dimensions ) cases .",
    "the 2d darboux transformations have even more interesting properties distinguishing them from the classical 1d case .",
    "it may be pointed out that initially linear operators such as the schrdinger operator appeared just as a technical tool for solving nonlinear equations by the inverse scattering method , but gradually a different understanding has emerged .",
    "namely , integrable equations of kdv type can be regarded as continuous symmetry transformations ( spectral symmetries ) for sturm - liouville / schrdinger type operators . from the same viewpoint",
    "one can treat darboux transformations as discrete spectral symmetries  @xcite .",
    "it was found that darboux transformations for 1d schrdinger operator can be regarded themselves as liouville ",
    "arnold integrable discrete time hamiltonian systems in the sense of veselov  @xcite .",
    "recently even more remarkable connections were discovered . by an analysis of discrete symmetries such as darboux transformations for",
    "the schrdinger type operators in the 1d and 2d cases , one can obtain deep results about their spectral properties ; the very existence of such symmetries serves as a guiding principle for the `` correct '' discretization of the 1d and 2d continuous systems  @xcite .",
    "about 20 years ago it was proved that every darboux transformation for 1d schrdinger operator can be represented as a product of darboux transformations of order one .",
    "first , it was proved  @xcite ( theorem 5 ) in the special case when application of darboux transformations leads to operators @xmath1 with the potential is different from the initial potential @xmath2 by a constant",
    ". then it was proved  @xcite in the special case when the darboux transformation has order two . and ,",
    "finally , in  @xcite and the follow - up paper  @xcite ( sec.3 ) it was proved for arbitrary potentials .",
    "a factorization of a darboux transformation into elementary darboux transformations is not unique in this case and it turned out that different factorizations of the same darboux transformation are related to the yang - baxter maps  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate and prove an analog of this statement for 2d case . in  @xcite darboux",
    "considered operators of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and in particular , hinted at the possibility of factorization of darboux transformations for such operators , but the conjecture was not formulated explicitly .",
    "thus , it was a problem on its own to formulate the precise statement .    for 1d schrdinger operator darboux transformations of first order can be only of _ wronskian type _",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : wronsk_transf ] ) . for 2d schrdinger operator",
    "there have been two known types of darboux transformations of first order : of _ wronskian type _ and _ laplace transformations _ ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : laplace_transf ] ) . as the first step , in  @xcite , we showed that there are no other types of darboux transformations of order one . in  @xcite",
    "we proved the factorization conjecture for the special case of darboux transformations of order two .",
    "the idea there was the transition to the space of ( differential ) invariants .",
    "in general the existence of a factorization for a darboux transformation of order two is equivalent to a complicated system of nonlinear partial differential equations . by using differential invariants",
    ", we were able to split this system into two : one linear system in terms of invariants ( the linearization ) and another still non - linear but much simpler system ( expressions of these differential invariants in terms of the coefficients ) , and solved them completely . in this work we found suitable invariants by using the regularized moving frames method of fels and olver  @xcite .",
    "later , in  @xcite , we found compact formulas for differential invariants for darboux transformations of arbitrary order in terms of complete bell polynomials .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an algebraic approach to darboux transformations , and prove the conjecture for darboux transformations of arbitrary orders . the correct algebraic framework ( as we believe ) giving the general notion of darboux transformations",
    "is described in  sec.[sec : def ] . there",
    "we define a _ category of darboux transformations _ as follows .",
    "its objects are operators @xmath7 with the same principal symbol , and for a pair of objects @xmath7 and @xmath1 , a morphism ( a darboux transformation from @xmath7 to @xmath1 ) is the equivalence class of a pair of operators @xmath8 that satisfy @xmath9 and are considered up to the equivalence @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary differential operator .",
    "we showed that the result of the composition of two darboux transformations does not depend on the choice of its representatives . in practice ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are not on an equal footing : once @xmath7 and @xmath12 are fixed , equality   implies that there are only algebraic conditions on the coefficients of the operators @xmath13 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the principal symbol of @xmath13 is the same as the principal symbol of @xmath12 , and the order of these operators is called the order of the darboux transformation .",
    "an operator @xmath12 may generate several , infinitely many or no darboux transformations for a given @xmath7 .",
    "we would stress that this definition does not define a new object but provides a correct algebraic framework for the existing one .",
    "note that our algebraic approach is applicable to arbitrary differential operators with arbitrary number of variables , while in this paper ( from the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : lada ] ) we apply it to 2d schrdinger operator .",
    "this algebraic framework and some preliminary facts are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : lada ]",
    ". the practical result of this part is visible in sec .",
    "[ sec : make_ordinary ] , in which we show that for 2d schrdinger operator @xmath7 by a combination of darboux transformation with certain number of laplace transformations , we can obtain a darboux transformation where the differential operator @xmath12 contains derivatives with respect to one variable only .",
    "there we give a rigorous formulation and a proof of the idea originally mentioned by darboux in very general terms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with the original text ) .",
    "[ sec : new ] is devoted to a few facts about darboux transformations which we use in further sections .",
    "[ sec : yes ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : no ] are the two cases of the proof of the main result of the paper . in the case",
    "where the intersection of the kernels of the operators @xmath12 and @xmath7 is not trivial , we can factor out a wronskian type elementary darboux transformation ( sec  [ sec : yes ] ) , and if this intersection of kernels is trivial , we can factor out a laplace transformation ( sec  [ sec : no ] , this is also the most difficult case ) . in both cases",
    "the proof is constructive . in sec .",
    "[ sec : main ] we give the main result of the paper ( theorem  [ thm : main_very2 ] ) and discuss its corollaries .    among remaining related open problems",
    "there is the following . in the 1d case",
    "the factorization is not unique and the relations between different factorizations can be described in terms of yang ",
    "baxter maps ( adler and veselov ) .",
    "any analogs of that for the 2d case studied in this paper , remain an open question .",
    "since darboux himself , many authors who have used the notion of darboux transformations may understand by them different albeit closely related objects . in this section",
    "we propose an algebraical formalization of this notion .",
    "we shall start from describing elementary darboux transformations of order one that will be the building blocks of general transformations .    in this paper",
    "we follow algebraic approach and work with elements of some differential field @xmath14 of characteristic zero with commuting derivations @xmath15 . by @xmath16",
    "$ ] we denote the corresponding ring of linear partial differential operators over @xmath14 .",
    "one can either assume the field @xmath14 to be differentially closed , or simply assume that @xmath14 contains the solutions of those partial differential equations that we encounter on the way .",

    "the second lower index attached to a symbol denoting a function means the derivative of that function with respect to the variables listed there .",
    "for example , @xmath24 .",
    "we also use einstein summation convention .      in sec .",
    "[ subsec : laplace_transf ] and  [ sec : wronsk_transf ] we outline some known facts about particular types of darboux transformations , for more details see  @xcite . if for an operator @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , the expression @xmath27 known as _ laplace invariant _ @xmath28 , is not zero , then the operator @xmath29 generates a darboux transformation for @xmath7 .",
    "if for an operator @xmath7 the function of its coefficients @xmath30 known as _ laplace invariant _ @xmath31 , is not zero , then the operator @xmath32 generates a darboux transformation for @xmath7 .",
    "these two transformations are called _ laplace transformations_. laplace transformations are inverses of each other up to a gauge transformation .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath7 there is a chain of laplace transformations @xmath33 we shall refer to it briefly as the _ laplace chain _ of @xmath7 .",
    "one moves along this chain to the right using the laplace transformation defined by @xmath34 and to the left using the laplace transformation defined by @xmath35 . as mentioned above , @xmath36 is the condition of moving from @xmath7 to the right . for",
    "the resulting operator @xmath1 one can also compute its @xmath28- and @xmath31-laplace invariants : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which as one can show is just @xmath28 .",
    "thus , moving along this chain at each step only one of the laplace invariants may be changed . if at some step either @xmath39 or @xmath40 , then taking into account that @xmath41 this means that @xmath7 can be factored . in the latter case",
    "the corresponding differential equation can be solved , as well as the initial equation can be solved , and explicit formulas to obtain such general solution are known .",
    "the pair of laplace invariants completely defines operator @xmath7 up to a gauge transformation @xmath42 since laplace invariants are the only ( differential ) invariants of the operator   under the action of the gauge transformations .",
    "there are no analogs of laplace transformations in 1d case , while another type of transformations , wronskian type occurs in both 1d and 2d cases .      for operator @xmath25 , where @xmath26 consider a non - zero @xmath43 .",
    "then each of the following operators generates a darboux transformation for @xmath7 : @xmath44 operators   and   can be equivalently defined as @xmath45 this can be generalized further  @xcite , and some darboux transformations of arbitrary orders can be constructed for a given operator @xmath7 of the form   provided we know a certain number of ( linearly independent ) elements in the kernel of @xmath7 . precisely , if @xmath46 linearly independent and non - zero @xmath47 then operator @xmath12 given by @xmath48 defines a darboux transformation for @xmath7 . here , given functions @xmath49 @xmath50 is a determinant of order @xmath51 called the @xmath52-wronkian , where @xmath53 .",
    "the constructed in such a way darboux transformation is of order @xmath54 .    in  @xcite",
    "we proved that for operators @xmath25 there are only two kinds of darboux transformations of order one : wronskian type darboux transformations of order one and laplace transformations .",

    "the darboux s idea that we start with was originally hinted in @xmath59 sentences in his book , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( at the moment there is no english translation of the book ) .",
    "the general structure of darboux transformations for 1d case was suggested in  @xcite , and some idea for 2d case is mentioned .",
    "here we finally find a way of dealing with these ideas by introducing the following algebraic definition of a general darboux transformation .",
    "+    consider differential operators @xmath7 and @xmath1 with the same principal symbol .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is obtained by a _ darboux transformation _ of @xmath7 if there exist differential operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 of arbitrary orders such that the following intertwining relation holds : @xmath60 we view a darboux transformation as an arrow with source @xmath7 and target @xmath1 . by definition , this arrow is a pair @xmath61 satisfying   considered up to the equivalence : @xmath62 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary differential operator .",
    "the equivalence is motivated by the following linear map corresponding to every intertwining relation  : @xmath63 it is clear that @xmath64 , where @xmath11 is an arbitrary differential operator , defines the same linear map of kernels . on the level of operators we have @xmath65 now",
    ", we see that the equivalence of pairs @xmath61 defined above is such that equivalent pairs define the same transformation of the solution spaces .",
    "thus , we have defined darboux transformations as equivalence classes .",
    "now we define the composition of darboux transformations .",
    "suppose we have operators @xmath66 , and @xmath67 linked by darboux transformations by pairs @xmath61 , @xmath68 , respectively , so that @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "we define the _ composition _ of these darboux transformations as the darboux transformation @xmath71 represented by the pair @xmath72 .",
    "[ lem : comp ] the result of the composition of two darboux transformations does not depend on the choice of their representatives .",
    "this lemma was essentially proved in our earlier paper  @xcite , and here we re - formulate it so that it would fit the context .",
    "hence , the composition of darboux transformations is is well - defined .",
    "everything above is true for arbitrary operators @xmath66 and @xmath73 of arbitrary orders and depending on arbitrary number of variables .",
    "darboux himself considered operators @xmath7 only in the form @xmath74 . from now on , we shall restrict ourselves to these operators too , which are often referred to as algebraic 2d schrdinger operators , or simply 2d schrdinger operators .",
    "the form of such operators allows us to find an operator @xmath11 so that @xmath75 does not contain mixed derivatives .",
    "this means , that in every equivalence class we can choose a _ standard representative _  a pair @xmath61 , such that @xmath12 does not contain mixed derivatives",
    ". we shall call it _ the projection of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath7 _ and denote @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for some @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 @xmath80 where we assume summation by index @xmath81 and by index @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath12 be an operator of the form  , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then we define the _ bi - degree _ of @xmath12 as follows : @xmath85    let @xmath12 be an arbitrary operator in @xmath86}$ ] , then we define the bi - degree of such operator with respect to some given operator @xmath7 of the form   as follows : @xmath87    there is a number of interesting works that touch on the problem of a definition of darboux transformations from different prospectives .",
    "the intuition about darboux transformations as mappings of kernels  @xcite is most closely followed in the recent work  @xcite of cassidy and singer , where the related problem of factorization of operators is viewed as the problem of filtration of the corresponding differential algebraic group .",
    "they showed that a filtration by a finite subnormal series of algebraic groups ( and such that successive quotients are almost simple ) exists and is unique .",
    "this work has overlap with ideas of the earlier work  @xcite of tsarev .",
    "although these results significantly clarify the general picture , they did not lead to a constructive algorithm .",
    "another notable approach has been suggested in  @xcite . in there",
    "an initial differential operator @xmath7 of an arbitrary order @xmath51 is represented as a system of first - order partial differential equations .",
    "then a generalized version of darboux transformation is constructed as a transformation of this system of first - order partial differential equations .",
    "the idea is very interesting , but needs further development and working out many details .",
    "for example , there is probably no one - to - one correspondence between darboux transformations defined by intertwining relation   and the generalized darboux transformations suggested in  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite some work is done towards finding a general type of transformations that includes darboux transformations .",
    "to summarize , in this subsection we have defined a category of darboux transformations .",
    "its objects are operators @xmath7 , and for a pair of objects @xmath7 and @xmath1 we defined an arrow ( or a morphism ) as the equivalence class of a pair @xmath61 as above . note that we have actually defined many categories , one for each principal symbol of the operator @xmath7 .",
    "discussion of the previous section implies in particular that for each darboux transformation of a 2d schrdinger operator we can choose a representative transformation defined by an intertwining relation   with @xmath12 that has no mixed derivatives .",
    "now we reduce this case to the case where operator @xmath12 is an ordinary differential operator of order less than @xmath88 .",
    "the latter is achieved by a composition of the initial darboux transformation with a series of laplace transformations . unlike the algebraic definition of darboux transformation above , where only the motivating idea was due to darboux",
