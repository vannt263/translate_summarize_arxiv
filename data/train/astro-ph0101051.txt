    "a hard x - ray selection is one of good selection methods that can sample agns without bias against heavy absorption to the nucleus .",
    "_ asca _ is the first satellite that is sensitive enough to detect agns beyond nearby universe in the hard x - ray band .",
    "many optical spectroscopic - follow - up observations have been and being done for x - ray sources detected in _ asca",
    "_ surveys that range from wide - area medium sensitivity surveys ( e.g. , della ceca et al . 2000 ) to deep surveys with a few pointings ( e.g. , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "1997 ) . to understand luminous agns in the @xmath0 universe ,",
    "the _ asca _ agn sample is still better than samples of agns from deep _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ surveys ( figure 1 ) .    here , the results of optical identification of the _ asca _ large sky survey ( hereafter lss ; ueda et al . 1999a ; akiyama et al .",
    "2000a ) and the _ asca _ medium sensitivity survey ( hereafter mss ; ueda et al .",
    "1999b ) are summarized .",
    "an advantage of the two surveys is high completeness of the optical identification ( 33/34 for _ asca _ lss and 51/55 for _ asca _ mss , so far ) .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "lss covers 5 degree@xmath6 area near the north galactic pole down to @xmath7 erg@xmath3 @xmath4 s@xmath3 . the optical identification is done for 34 x - ray sources detected by sis detector and 30 agns are identified . on the other hand , the _ asca _ mss is a serendipitous survey of gis pointing observations from 1993 to 1996 .",
    "the original sample consists of 55 x - ray sources with flux more than @xmath8 erg@xmath3 @xmath4 s@xmath3 in the northern sky selected from 15 arcmin radius areas of 176 gis field of views .",
    "the sample contains 48 agns so far .",
    "the optical identification of the _ asca _ mss is now being extended to x - ray sources detected in outer area of gis and in southern sky observations .",
    "finally the _ asca _ mss sample will contain more than 100 identified sources .",
    "a sample of hard x - ray selected agns enables us to estimate the fraction of absorbed agns .",
    "the redshift vs. luminosity distribution of the identified agns is shown in figure 1 .",
    "squares and large circles represent _ asca _ lss and mss agns respectively .",
    "one fifth of identified agns are narrow - line ( broad - line - weak ) and absorbed agns . in the luminosity range below @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 , one third of agns are absorbed narrow - line agns .",
    "considering the fact that objects with absorption column densities of up to @xmath10 of @xmath11 @xmath4 can be detected without bias using 210  kev emission , the fraction of absorbed narrow - line agns is consistent with the absorption column density distribution of nearby seyfert galaxies ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand , in the luminosity range above @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 , 14 broad - line agns are detected in total , but no narrow - line agn is found .",
    "the result suggests lack of absorbed luminous agns ( deficiency of type 2 qsos ) .",
    "similar tendencies also appear in the _ heao1 _",
    "a2 sample ( small circles in figure 1 ; piccinotti et al .",
    "1982 ) and recent results of _ chandra _ optical identification ( small triangles in figure 1 ; hornschemeier et al .",

    "_ chandra _ agns with a strong broad - line(s ) in their optical spectra or listed as a qso are plotted with open symbols , and filled symbols represent other agns or galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the optical identificaiton of _ chandra _ sources is not complete at this moment and unidentified x - ray sources with red optical couterparts may be a missing population of type 2 qsos .",
    "some of broad - line z@xmath11 qsos have harder x - ray spectra than typical x - ray spectra of qsos ( power - law with photon index of 1.7 ) , although their optical colors , optical spectra , and x - ray to optical flux ratios are same as normal qsos . in the _ asca _ lss agns , four high - redshift broad - line qsos show hard x - ray spectra with apparent photon indices of 1.3@xmath130.3 . the hard x - ray spectra",
    "may also be explained by absorption with log @xmath10(@xmath4)=22@xmath123 at the object s redshift , if we assume an intrinsic photon index of 1.7 ( figure 2 , it should be noted that redshifts and hard x - ray luminosities correlate each other in the _ asca _ lss sample .",
    "therefore , the hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath3 corresponds to the redshift of @xmath15 ) .",
    "similar hardenings of x - ray spectra of high - redshift broad - line qsos are also reported in other _",
    "asca _ surveys ( della ceca et al . 2000 ) and _ beppo - sax _ surveys ( la franca et al . 2000 ) . the origin of the hardness is not clear yet .",
    "the hardness of the x - ray spectra of high - redshift qsos may be explained by the existence of the reflection component . because of a bump of the reflection component , observed photon indices of type 1 seyferts in the 0.710  kev band",
    "is expected to get harder to @xmath16 .",
    "a few candidates of narrow - line - strong absorbed qsos were found in the _ asca _ surveys , though the fraction of absorbed agns in the high luminosity range is not as high as that in the low luminosity range .",
    "ax  j131831 + 3341 is a moderately absorbed ( @xmath10 of @xmath17 @xmath4 ) qso at z=0.65 found in the _ asca _ lss ( akiyama et al .",
    "2000b , akiyama et al . 2001 ) .",
    "its optical spectrum shows strong emission lines , such as broad mg ii 2800  , narrow [ o ii ] 3727  , and narrow [ o iii ] 5007  , but no broad h@xmath18 emission line .",
    "its small h@xmath18-to-[o iii ] 5007  equivalent width ratio [ log(h@xmath18/[o iii])@xmath19 is comparable to those of seyfert 1.82 galaxies ( winkler 1992 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is estimated to be @xmath20 , which is as large as the luminosity of the knee of the agn luminosity function in the 210  kev band at @xmath21 ( e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "1998 ) , and corresponds to the luminosities of qsos .",
    "the optical and near - infrared images show a nucleus and an extended host galaxy around the qso ( left panel in figure 3 ) . in the right panel of figure 3 ,",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 colors of nuclear and host galaxy components are shown . the nuclear component have blue @xmath22 colors but red @xmath23 color .",
    "the @xmath23 color of the nuclear component is much redder than optically - selected qsos at similar redshifts ( open squares ; elvis et al .",
    "a possible explanation of these colors is that , in the @xmath24 band , heavily absorbed ( @xmath25 mag ) nucleus emerges , while optical light originates from scattered blue nuclear light .",
    "the estimated fraction of scattered light is 2% , which is similar to that observed in narrow - line radio galaxies ( alighieri et al .",
    "such a red optical to near - infrared color and a blue optical color may be common characteristics of x - ray selected absorbed qsos at intermediate redshifts .",
    "recent observations reveal that another absorbed qso at a redshift of 0.9 , ax  j08494 + 4454 , also has a blue optical color and a red optical to near - infrared color ( @xmath26 mag and @xmath27 mag ; nakanishi et al .",
    "2000 ; akiyama et al . in preparation ) . also , a significant fraction of the optical and near - infrared counterparts of _ chandra _ hard x - ray sources show similar red near - infrared colors ( @xmath28 mag ) and blue optical colors ( @xmath29 mag ) ( mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the host galaxy extends 62 kpc away from the nucleus .",
    "the asymmetric and extended structure of the component suggests a galaxy interaction or merging in the host galaxy .",
    "the @xmath30 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 colors of the host galaxy are consistent with a stellar population with age of 1 gyr .",
    "thus , ax  j131831 + 3341 may have a post - starburst galaxy as the host galaxy like a `` post - starburst quasar '' , un  j1025 - 0040 ( brotherton et al .",
