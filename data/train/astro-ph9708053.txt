    "equivalent widths of the absorption features can not be used directly in most cases , because they are affected by continuum from the wd+accretion structure , but flux deficits relative to a reference continuum remain unaffected .",
    "we followed roughly the procedure described by wade & horne ( 1988 ) .",
    "first , we subtracted the telluric line at @xmath72 by fitting each component by a gaussian using the outer wings on three spectra obtained in phases 0.90.1 .",
    "then we fitted the continuum to the spectra with a second order polynom , which is almost a straight line in that part of the spectrum , and finally calculated the flux deficits of @xmath73 of the tio bands .",

    "the accuracy of our measurements does not allow a more precise estimate .",
    "this is not surprising , because the majority of the short - period cvs below the period gap have late - type companions ( echevarra ( 1983 ) , tovmassian ( 1984 ) ) .",

    "when we see the back - side of the companion - the v brightness drops down to v@xmath7619 mag .",
    "this implies a lower limit for a distance of 100150 pc , consistent with the rough guess from the x - ray absorption measure .",
    "the basic results of our observational study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "based on the nature of the x - ray spectrum , the synchronized wd spin and orbital period , and despite the moderate strength of he  ii relative to h@xmath52 , the rosat all - sky survey source is identified as a new eclipsing polar .",
    "the orbital period is found to be 98.2 min .",
    "narrow eclipses are observed which correspond to the occultation of the hot spot on the accretion stream by the companion .",
    "the eclipse period coincides with the radial velocity variations of the major emission lines . 2 .   the high amplitude of the radial velocity variations and its phasing relative to the eclipses allow us to conclude that the major line emission also comes from the frame of the accretion stream and hot spot",
    "however , line emission requires different conditions ( e.g. density ) then continuums emission , so that the two emission regions are expected to be distinct .",
    "we were successful to retrieve also the weaker component of emission lines formed on the heated side of the secondary .",
    "the geometric interpretation fits well the usual picture of eclipsing polars in analogy with other similar magnetic cataclysmic variables .",
    "3 .   from the absorption of the x - ray spectrum and the inferred absolute magnitude of the companion as compared to the observed one we estimate a lower limit of the distance to d @xmath77 100150 pc .",
    "the phase - averaged , unabsorbed x - ray luminosity is 2.5@xmath1110@xmath78 ( d/100 pc)@xmath79 erg / s in the 0.12.4 kev range .",
    "4 .   the doppler tomography localizes the source of strong he  ii line emission to the accretion stream / hot spot .",
    "other lines with lower excitation levels are more spread out over the system .",
    "the detection of the two emission lines at 8200   and 8660   is one of the most exciting ( and barely understood ) results of these observations .",
    "although we were unable to identify them with any known lines , their presence implies the existence of conditions in which arise in very few systems only ( based on the lack of detections in many other polars ) .",
    "unfortunately , the amount of existing data does not yet allow any further conclusions .",
    "6 .   a low magnetic field for the white dwarf is suggested by three facts : ( a ) the optical spectrum does not show hints for cyclotron lines .",
    "( b ) the x - ray spectrum is observed to be rather hard .",
    "the soft - to - hard x - ray flux ratio for polars with measured magnetic field strengths has been shown to increase with magnetic field ( beuermann & schwope 1994 ) .",
    "( c ) the stronger photometric modulation in red than in blue and its phasing also argues for a low magnetic field .",
