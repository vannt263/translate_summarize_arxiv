    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     for the proposed quantum simulation , the interacting quantum systems can be prepared individually and their mutual coupling strength can be controlled by varying the distance @xmath34 between ions and fermions . the ion crystal can be cooled to its ground state using resolved sideband cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the motional state of the ion crystal can be initialized and read out by laser - induced coupling to internal states of the ions which can be measured with standard fluorescence measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> building on these techniques , interferometric methods have been proposed to probe ion crystals near structural phase transitions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> precise control over small numbers of ultracold fermions in optical traps has recently been demonstrated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic density profile is accessible via absorption imaging in combination with time - of - flight analysis . for low densities </S>",
    "<S> , the atoms can be retrapped in an optical molasses trap to prevent them from leaving the imaging region during detection . </S>",
    "<S> while we have focused on fermionic atomic species in this letter , it is also possible to trap bosonic species such as @xmath118li , where ion - controlled tunneling dynamics and josephson physics may be investigated  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> hybrid ultracold atom - ion systems pose several challenges for experimental realization . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic collisions  in particular charge transfer and molecular ion formation  may limit the lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that for some species the rates may be sufficiently small to study intricate setups , such as in a recent experiment where the spin relaxation of a single yb@xmath2 ion immersed in a bosonic rb bath has been studied  @xcite . however , no experimental data are available for inelastic rates between ultracold k or li with trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> the use of polarized fermionic systems may reduce the effects of three - body recombination as binary atom collisions are suppressed in the ultracold regime  @xcite . in the geometry in which we studied the peierls transition , </S>",
    "<S> ions and atoms are separated and inelastic collisions are suppressed . for the reduction of atomic heating effects due to ion micromotion we rely on the largest experimentally feasible mass ratio between ions and atoms ( @xmath1yb@xmath2 and @xmath0li )  @xcite and prevent the atoms from approaching the ions too closely  @xcite . to further mitigate micromotion - induced heating , it may be feasible to use heavier molecular ions , which could be sympathetically cooled by suitable cotrapped ion species .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed an analog quantum simulator for lattice hamiltonians that can be tuned into a regime of strong coupling to vibrational phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the simulation of complex many - body hamiltonians that even go beyond seminal condensed matter models , such as the frhlich and holstein models , known to be relevant for phenomena such as superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> future work will focus on solving the 3d many - body atom - ion problem including short - range interactions , considering the time - dependent potential of the ions and the role of the spin degrees of freedom in order to engineer entanglement between the atoms and ions .    </S>",
