    "turbulent particle pair diffusion has attained somewhat of an iconic status in the turbulence community , many researchers having addressed this topic over the decades . nevertheless , most if not all theories of turbulent particle pair diffusion in homogeneous turbulence with extended inertial ranges have been based upon the hypothesis of locality since richardson in 1926 @xcite , and obukov in 1941 @xcite .",
    "richardson pioneered this field and introduced the idea of a scale dependent pair diffusivity as the fundamental quantity of interest in turbulent pair diffusion studies .",
    "the turbulent pair diffusivity is defined as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pair displacement vector at time @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the pair relative velocity , and @xmath15 is the ensemble average over all particle pairs .    the locality hypothesis can readily be applied to generalized power law spectra of the type , @xmath16 , for @xmath17 ; the pair diffusivity then scales like @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xcite , where @xmath20 . for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath21 , this gives the well known richardson scaling @xmath22 , which is equivalent to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "kinematic simulations ( ks ) @xcite has often been used to investigate turbulent pair diffusion , even though it does not yield the assumed locality scaling ; for @xmath21 , ks gives @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason , it has been widely assumed that ks must be in error .",
    "thomson & devenish @xcite argue that the turbulent pair diffusivity must scale like , @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the structure function of the turbulence velocity field and @xmath27 is an effective time scale of velocity increments . in real turbulence",
    ", assuming locality scaling for @xmath28 and for @xmath29 leads to richardson s classical scaling @xmath30 , where we evaluate @xmath1 at typical values of @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 which is commonly assumed in these studies .",
    "thomson & devenish argue that in ks because of the lack of true dynamical sweeping , the time scale must be a sweeping time scale , namely @xmath33 which is a time scale for the large scales flow to cut through smaller local eddies , @xmath34 being the sweeping velocity scale .",
    "this leads to , @xmath35 .",
    "even when the rms turbulence velocity @xmath36 is taken instead of @xmath34 , they obtained @xmath37 .",
    "they concluded that whereas locality is true in real turbulence , it is not true in ks . in turbulence",
    "the large energy containing eddies carry the smaller eddies , but in ks as there is an absence of true dynamics the large scales force the fluid particles to cut through the smaller eddies in an unphysical manner , a view supported by nicolleau & nowakowski @xcite , and eyink & benveniste @xcite",
    ".    however , thomson & devenish s scaling argument leading to equation ( 2 ) adresses only the scaling laws for @xmath1 , but does not quantified the actual errors in the diffusivity @xmath1 in ks  is it large or small ? it is prudent , therefore , to seek an alternative , a more analytic , approach to address this question , which is the main concern of this work .",
    "here we re - examine the sweeping effect in ks with a view of quantitfying the error in the ks pair diffusivity @xmath38 compared to the physical pair diffusivity @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose , we focus upon the _ differences _ in the relative velocities along pairs of particle paths in the _ sweeping frame of reference_. this frame of reference accounts for the physical sweeping effect of the largest energy containing scales ; but a residual sweeping effect still remains due to the largest inertial range eddies sweeping the smaller inertial range eddies .    consider fig . 1 which shows a particle pair with separation @xmath39 in the inertial subrange being swept by a large scale flow .",
    "a real fluid particle pair will be swept by the physical velocity field @xmath40 and will follow certain particle paths ; but a ks flow will transport the pair along neighbouring particle paths due to an additional ks sweeping motion , @xmath41 , and thereby force the particles to cut through local flow structures .    the large scale physical sweeping velocity are assumed not to affect the relative motion of particles in a pair in the inertial subrange .",
    "the critical question is , are the deviations from the physical trajectories induced by ks in the pair diffusion process large or small ?    in the ensuing analysis , it is the error between the ks and the physical pair diffusivities , @xmath42 , that will be calculated .",
    "we will consider generalised power law energy spectra , @xmath16 , because the analysis must be valid for all such power spectra and this will add weight to the results and conclusions that can be drawn from this work if validated over the wholw range of @xmath43 considered .",
    "the main questions of interest are , is the ks sweeping error large or small , and in what range of separations ?",
    "these questions are addressed first through a novel mathematical analysis focussing upon pairs of neighbouring particle trajectories .",
    "this is then verified against simulations using ks with very large inertial subranges .    in section 1",
    ", we derive an expression for the error in the pair diffusivity in ks flows by analysing neighbouring trajectories in the swept frame of reference . in section 2",
    ", the ks method is discussed and simulation results presented . in the final section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the results and its implications for theory and modeling .",
    "in the swept frame of reference , the relative motion of a particle pair in the inertial subrange is unaffected by the sweeping action itself .",
    "this can be mimicked in ks by setting @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "however , there still remains a residual sweeping caused by the largest of the inertial scales sweeping the scales local to the pair separation .",
    "consider an ensemble of particle pairs released in a field of homogeneous turbulence at time @xmath46 with some small initial separation @xmath47 . at some time @xmath12 later , the ensemble average of the separation is assumed to be well inside the inertial subrange and the relative motions are independent of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "consider the particles in one of these pairs , labeled @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the particle locations are @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively at time @xmath12 ; and the pair displacement is @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the physical flow is @xmath54 .",
    "all quantities are assumed at time @xmath12 unless otherwise stated .    at time",
    "@xmath12 the _ additional _ ( or _ residual _ ) ks sweeping flow @xmath55 is swiched on  this is not to be confused with the total ks velocity field which is @xmath56 , see fig",
    ". 1 .    the physical flow @xmath54 transports the particles to @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively at the next time step @xmath59 ; while the ks flow @xmath56 transports the particles to @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the superscript @xmath64 will refer to quantities at time @xmath65 , e.g. @xmath66 .",
    "the superscript @xmath67 will refer to quantities related to the ks residual sweeping , e.g. @xmath68 .",
    "the following quantities are defined :    @xmath69 + @xmath70 + @xmath71 + @xmath72 + @xmath73 + @xmath74    simplifying the notation as much as possible , e.g. @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , yields    @xmath77    @xmath78 is calculated at the new ks swept particle locations . using taylor expansions wherever necessary , assuming that the velocity fields are at least twice differentiable in space and at least once in time ,    @xmath79    the pair diffusivity at time @xmath65 is , @xmath80  we ignore constants of proportionality , like @xmath49 , because we are interested only in the power scalings in this work .",
    "the ks equivalent is @xmath81 . using equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and ignoring terms of order @xmath82 and higher ,",
    "@xmath83    the timestep error between the ks and physical diffusivities for a given timestep @xmath84 is , @xmath85 .",
    "using the expansion @xmath86 in equation ( 7 ) , yields    @xmath87    the time scale of the sweeping @xmath88 is much larger than the local time scale of the pair separation .",
    "hence , in the last four terms @xmath11 is replaced by @xmath89 without affecting their magnitudes or scalings ( the associated errors are @xmath90 which is neglected ) .",
    "all the terms in equation ( 8) are now evaluated at the same time @xmath65 , so without loss of generality @xmath65 is replaced by @xmath12 and the superscritp @xmath91 is dropped .",
    "the subscript @xmath92 is also dropped because of homogeneity .",
    "equation ( 8) now simplifies to ,    @xmath93    it is reasonable to assume that the ( residual ) sweeping flow field @xmath41 , which is caused by the largest of the inertial range eddies , is close to uniform across small distances , and therefore the relative velocities across local scales @xmath31 that it induces is small .",
    "however , gradients of the relative velocity @xmath14 itself can be large . the magnitude @xmath94 is assumed large compared to @xmath95 , and also as compared to @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 scales differently to @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath98 also scales differently to @xmath99 , the former being governed by inertial range turbulence scaling , and the latter by _ differences _ in the residual sweeping velocity across a small distance @xmath31 .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the limit of uniform ( parallel ) sweeping flow , where the @xmath14 is unaffected , but @xmath100 and all the terms on the right hand side in equation ( 9 ) are zero except for the second term .",
    "this indicates that the second term in equation ( 9 ) makes the dominant contribution to the error .",
    "consider generalized energy spectra of the form @xmath101 , for @xmath102 and for @xmath17 , and with @xmath103 .",
    "in the swept frame of reference , @xmath44 for @xmath45 . the rate of energy dissipation is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the velocity scale in the energy containing scales .",
    "the previous discussion implies that @xmath106 and therefore , @xmath107 the energy in turbulent inertial scales local to @xmath31 is , @xmath108 , and therefore , @xmath109    it is usual to assume the scaling @xmath110 as previously mentioned .",
    "then , the second term in equation ( 9 ) is given by , @xmath111    all the other terms in equation ( 9 ) , labeled respectively @xmath112 , scale proportional to @xmath97 or are much smaller , and this leads to the following estimates ,    @xmath113    all of these ratios are small for @xmath114 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is true even in the expression for @xmath115 because the factor @xmath116 is subdued by the very small factor in the brackets .",
    "it is reasonable to conclude that the 2nd term in equation ( 9 ) is dominant and therefore @xmath117 .    to estimate @xmath118 itself , an estimate for @xmath119",
    "is needed .",
    "the inertial subrange contains only about @xmath120 of the the total energy in the turbulence across the entire wavenumber range , @xmath121 , such as in a von karman spectrum @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "this means that the root mean square turbulent velocity in the inertial range is approximately , @xmath124 , where @xmath125 .",
    "the wavenumbers that contribute to the sweeping of particle pairs at separation @xmath2 are in the range @xmath126 , where @xmath127 . in the ks sweeping frame of reference ,",
    "the larger inertial scales are the sweeping scales , and the energy in these scales is approximately ,    @xmath128    and using @xmath129 , this gives    @xmath130    using this in equation ( ) , the residual error between the physical and the ks pair diffusivities in the inertial subrange of pair separations in the swept frame of reference , per unit timestep ( retaining @xmath131 to represent this quantity ) , is    @xmath132    @xmath133 is the constant of proportionality , which can depend upon @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath21 , the residual error per unit timestep is ,    @xmath134    as @xmath135 , @xmath136 for @xmath137 , but is nearly zero close to @xmath138 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath135 , the pair diffusion is strongly local and is not affected by long range sweeping .    for @xmath139 ,",
    "the residual error per unit timestep is negligibly small for @xmath137 ,    @xmath140    in this limit , nearly all the energy is contained in the largest scales and inertial subrange scaling is no longer applicable .",
    "equations ( 17 ) provides a way of estimating an upper bound for the integrated residual error .",
    "2 shows the log - log plots of the factor @xmath141 for selected powers in the range @xmath142 .",
    "the range over which @xmath143 is very short and close to @xmath144 ; but over the rest of the range @xmath145 .",
    "hence , to a good approximation , @xmath146 for all @xmath147 , and using this in equation ( 17 ) with @xmath148 yields ,    @xmath149    the integrated residual error , @xmath150 , over a period of time is ,    @xmath151    assuming the pair separation scaling @xmath152 , where @xmath12 is the time and for some @xmath153 , yields ,    @xmath154    if the pair diffusivity scales like , @xmath155 , for some @xmath156 then @xmath157 is an exact relation .",
    "the most important quantity is the normalised integrated residual error with respect to the pair diffusivity , @xmath0 .",
    "using the above expression for @xmath158 , and replacing the scalig with @xmath159 by scaling with @xmath7 , and absorping all ensuing constants in to a new constant @xmath160 , leads to    @xmath161    for strict locality scaling @xmath162 , and this becomes    @xmath163    since @xmath164 , @xmath165 decreases with increasing pair separation for all @xmath166 . for @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath167 and we obtain ,    @xmath168    thus , as @xmath4 then @xmath0 decreases ; and as @xmath6 then @xmath0 increases .    even for non - local scaling , assuming that @xmath169 does not deviate too far from the local scaling , the above order of magnitude for @xmath0",
    "is still approximately true .",
    "in fact , in ks we know , section 2.3 , that @xmath169 is slightly greater than locality so the errors will be slightly smaller than in eqution ( 25 ) .",
    "the magnitude of these errors will also depend upon @xmath160 ; but @xmath160 can not be determined from theoretical considerations alone , although it is reasonable to assume that @xmath160 is small enough for the @xmath0 to be negligible towards larger separations as @xmath4  this assumption will be justified by numerical simulations . even so this does not guarantee that the error will remain small at smaller separations , since @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "however , between these two asymptotic limits there must exist an intermediate range of separations , between @xmath170 , where the errors remain negligible .",
    "the crucial question is , how wide is this range of scales ?",
    "if this intermediate range is short then the ks errors will be significant at almost all separations .",
    "however , if it is long then the ks errors will be negligble inside this intermediate range where true inertial subrange scaling can be expected to be manifested .    to determine the extent of this intermediate range of scales , if it exists at all , simulations with ks must be performed with very large inertial subranges",
    "the normalised integrated error , @xmath0 , is scale dependent and reduces with increasing separation .",
    "the ks diffusivity is given by , @xmath171 as @xmath4 .",
    "it is expected that if there is an appreciable intermediate range where the errors are negligible , then the power scaling in @xmath38 must be constant and asymptotic to the limiting case where @xmath4 .",
    "the extent of this intermediate range is determined by the range over which the power scaling in @xmath38 is constant .",
    "furthermore , significant levels of the sweeping error means that the fluid particles cut through ks eddies , and therefore must be accompied by high levels of noise  the larger the relative sweeping error the larger the noise level .",
    "thus , where the errors are negligible it is expected that the correct power law scaling , @xmath172 , will be observed in that part of the of the inertial subrange .    on the other hand , where the errors are significant",
    "it is expected that @xmath38 will deviate from the true power law scaling for @xmath1 and also be accompanied with significant statistical noise due to fluid particles being swept through local eddies in that part of the inertial subrange . even in this case , however , it is expected that the errors and the associated noise diminish as the pair separation increases .",
    "comparison will be made between two cases : first , where @xmath38 is obtained from ks in the physically correct sweeping frame of reference ; and second , the case where large scale random sweeping velocities are explicitly added to the flow .",
    "the analysis for the latter case is similar to that which leads to equation ( 24 ) , except that the factor of @xmath173 in the denominator is now @xmath48 .",
    "both of these cases can therefore be written collectively as ,    @xmath174    where @xmath175 in the swept frame of reference , and @xmath176 when large random scales are included in the simulations ",
    "the residual errors are an order of magnitude smaller in the swept frame of reference .",

    "kinematic simulation [ 4,5 ] is a lagrangian method for particle diffusion in which the velocity fileld is prescribed as a sum of energy - weighted fourier modes .",
    "it is akin to the widely used random flight type of statistical models in which the dynamical interactions between turbulent length scales is not explcitly modeled , rather the overall effect on the statistical moments of particle diffusion is mimicked . in ks",
    "this is accomplished by specifying the energy spectrum @xmath183 .",
    "ks continues to be used in turbulent diffusion studies for both passive and inertial particle motion , including cases with generalized power - law energy spectra of the form @xmath16 for @xmath184 , maxey @xcite , turfus @xcite , fung & vassilicos @xcite , malik & vassilicos @xcite .",

    "the flow field ensemble generated in this manner is statistically homogeneous , isotropic , and stationary .",
    "an important feature of ks is that unlike some other lagrangian methods , by generating entire kinematic flow fields in which particles are tracked it does not suffer from the crossing - trajectories error which is caused when two fluid particles occupy the same location at the same time in violation of incompressibility ; but because ks flow fields are incompressible by construction this error is completely eliminated .",

    "the constant power law scaling over most of the inertial subrange of separations , @xmath246 , and the very low level of statistical noise in the swept frame of reference are especially important .",
    "( the departure from this for @xmath247 observed in fig .",
    "3 is outside of the inertial subrange . )",
    "the ks sweeping errrors in this frame of reference is thererfore negligible for most practical purposes .",
    "it is possible that ks could produce negligible sweeping errors in even bigger intermediate ranges than reported here , but the current simulations are the maximum size of inertial subrange possible , @xmath248 , with double - precision accuracy .",
    "it is remarkable that even when large scale sweeping is included , the ks sweeping errors remain small in the range @xmath244 .",
    "it is also noted that some direct numerical simulation ( dns ) show pair diffusion which appear to display locality scaling , see @xcite for example .",
    "however , the maximum inertial range obtained in dns to date is around @xmath249 , which is much shorter than required to test pair diffusion scaling reliably  that requires @xmath250 .",
    "thus the current ks results can not be compared directly with dns at the present time . however ,",
    "for low reynolds ks has been validated against dns for turbulent pair diffusion by malik & vassilicos @xcite ; here not only did the pair diffusion from ks closely match the dns results with the same energy specturm , but the fourth order statistic , the kurtosis in the pair separation , also matched remarkably well .",
    "the main contribution of this work is that it has been demonstrated that in a reference frame moving with the large energy containing scales the sweeping errors in the turbulent pair diffusion process in ks is negligible in the inertial subrange where , @xmath246 .",
    "this is significant not only because it amends the previous theory of @xcite , but it is important for turbulent diffusion modeling and applications in general , and especially for pair diffusion studies .    if the sweeping errors are negligible , why is locality scaling not oberved for @xmath21 where ks yields @xmath24 ?",
    "there are two possible explanations .",
    "first , other errors could be present in ks , not due to the sweeping , but to as yet unknown sources ; but no one has proposed any such source of error in , and so this remains very speculative .",
    "the second possibility is that the locality hypothesis itself may be error .",
    "this goes against the widely accepted theory of richardson [ 1 ] , and no one has proposed alternative theory . on the other hand , it should be noted that the locality scaling for the pair diffusion has never been confirmed unequivocally as noted by salazar & collins @xcite  so there is room for new thinking in this field .",
    "these are currently the subjects of active research by the author .",
    "what can be said for certain at the present time is that the departure from locality scaling observed in ks can not be attributed to the sweeping effect .",
