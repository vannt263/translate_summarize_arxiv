    "ever since zariski s pioneering work , valuations have been considered to be natural generalizations of points . however , in the context of linear systems defined by multiple base points on projective varieties , positivity , and seshadri constants , this point of view seems to have been explored explicitly only recently .    in @xcite and @xcite , s. boucksom , m. dumnicki , a. kronya , c. maclean , and t. szemberg introduced the constant @xmath5 of a valuation ( here denoted @xmath6 ) , analogous to the @xmath0-invariant introduced by l.  ein , s.  d.  cutkosky and r.  lazarsfeld in @xcite for ideals ( see also @xcite ) . for a valuation @xmath7 centered at the origin of @xmath8 $ ]",

    "jonsson @xcite ) or spaces of _ seminorms _ , usually called berkovich spaces @xcite , which essentially coincide in dimension two ( see m.  jonsson @xcite for a description in the plane case ) .",
    "being compact and arcwise connected , the topology of such spaces has very interesting and useful properties .",
    "the work of s.  boucksom , c.  favre and m.  jonsson @xcite , @xcite implicitly reveals connections between such valuation spaces , positivity , and birational geometry .    in this paper the invariant @xmath6",
    "is studied as a function on the space @xmath10 of plane valuations of real rank 1 , which is continuous along arcs in @xmath10 .",
    "motivated by what is known in the case of points and by the conjectures of nagata and segre  harbourne  gimigliano  hirschowitz , our focus will be on valuations along a _ very general _ half - line in @xmath10 .",
    "we let @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a very general quasimonomial valuation with characteristic exponent @xmath14 ( we refer the reader to sections [ sec : preliminaries ] and [ sec : quasimonomial ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "divisorial valuations are dense in each arc of the valuation space ; we will be primarily interested in such valuations ; therefore we often work on the minimal proper birational model @xmath15 where the center of @xmath13 is a divisor .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath16 , and the equality is expected to hold unless there is a good geometric reason , in the form of a @xmath17-curve on @xmath15 with value higher than expected .",
    "when @xmath15 supports an effective anticanonical divisor , we have extensive knowledge on its geometry , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the cone of curves is generated by the @xmath18-curves on the model and components of the anticanonical divisor , which allows one to compute @xmath6 . in this case there",
    "exists in fact a @xmath17-curve computing @xmath19 , which as a result is piecewise linear near @xmath14 ; see theorem [ lastthm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : supraminimal ] contains a description of a ( countably infinite ) family of @xmath17-curves determining @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and other small values of @xmath14 .",
    "we conjecture that this list is complete . if that is indeed so , then in particular @xmath21 for @xmath22 , which implies nagata s conjecture .",
    "indeed , integer values of @xmath14 can be interpreted as the _ number of points _ that have been blown up , and we can look at @xmath19 as a continuous function that interpolates between the inverses of seshadri constants at @xmath14 very general points whose values at non - integer @xmath14 also have geometric meaning .",
    "in addition , it is not hard to show ( proposition  [ squares ] ) that for integer values of @xmath14 that are squares , @xmath23 holds .    as an unexpected connection , we want to mention that , except for 9 cases , the @xmath17-curves of section  [ sec : supraminimal ] are the same unicuspidal curves which give the asymptotically extremal ratio between degree and multiplicity , as explained in orevkov s work @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .     for @xmath24 ; in yellow , the lower bound @xmath25 .
