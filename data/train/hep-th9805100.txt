    "the burgers equation with a random external force is considered to be the first exactly solvable model of @xmath1  turbulence and has been extensively studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "though rather simplified , this model can serve as a test model for some general ideas within the theory of strong turbulence . in  1995 ,",
    "methods of quantum field theory were applied to this problem by a.  polyakov  @xcite which enabled a qualitative explanation of velocity - difference probability density functions ( pdfs ) measured numerically by a.  chekhlov and v.  yakhot  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the approach  @xcite allows one to obtain quantitatively correct results .",
    "extensive numerical simulations published recently by t.  gotoh and r.  kraichnan  @xcite show that the predictions of  @xcite are quite accurate , and coincide with the numerical simulations to within about  5@xmath2",
    ". v.  yakhot has shown in  @xcite that the ideas introduced in  @xcite can have much wider application , and can also work for incompressible velocity fluctuations .",
    "we believe that the operator product expansion ( ope ) , introduced in  @xcite to take into account the viscous term , is an adequate language to treat compressible turbulence in higher dimensions as well , where shock structures and associated local dissipation persist . in the present paper",
    "we find a closed equation for the velocity - gradient probability - density function ( pdf ) for compressible turbulence in any number of dimensions .",
    "we investigate the asymptotics of the pdf and present the numerical solution for the  @xmath3 case .",
    "the basic equation we will study is the following :    @xmath4    the force  @xmath5 is chosen to be gaussian with zero mean and white in time variance : @xmath6    where the @xmath7  function is concentrated at some large scale  @xmath8 , and can be expanded as follows    @xmath9    for @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the steady states for velocity gradient and velocity difference exist ; for this we can require , for example , that periodic boundary conditions on a scale much larger that  @xmath8 be imposed , and that the zero harmonic in the @xmath7  function be absent .",
    "these assumptions are usually used in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we appeal to the results obtained for the  @xmath1 burgers turbulence without pressure in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the velocity - gradient  pdf @xmath11 and the velocity - difference  pdf @xmath12 , where the velocities are taken at the same time at some fixed points  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 .",
    "the physical picture presented in these papers allows us to consider a general phenomenon such as intermittency on a rigorous basis ; it is related to the spontaneous breakdown of the galilean invariance of the forced equation and to the algebraic decay of the pdfs .",
    "we will not repeat these arguments here ; instead , we will concentrate on the main ideas which allow us to consider the multi - dimensional case",
    ".    we will be interested in the case of small dissipation @xmath15 , and will consider distances @xmath16 .",
    "the following order of the limits should be considered to get the steady state : we first set @xmath17 , and then consider the limit @xmath18 .",
    "to proceed quantitatively , consider the following characteristic function ( @xmath19 function ) for the velocity gradient @xmath20 :    @xmath21    due to eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , this function satisfies the following fokker - planck equation :    @xmath22z+d , \\label{fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where summation over repeated indices is assumed . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath23 . to derive this equation we differentiated  ( [ zfunction ] ) with respect to  @xmath24 and expressed  @xmath25 using eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "we made use of the following identities : @xmath26    @xmath27    and @xmath28    the  @xmath29 term describes the contribution of the dissipation and in steady state is given by :    @xmath30    without this term the steady state in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) does not exist .",
    "this term can not be closed without further assumptions . in @xcite , assumptions about scaling invariance , galilean invariance , and the operator product expansion were applied to close the analogous term for the velocity-_difference _ pdf . it is not obvious _ a priori _ that these methods can be applied to our problem , since the limits  @xmath31 and  @xmath18 may not be interchangeable .",
    "nevertheless , it was observed in the numerical simulations in  @xcite that the velocity - difference and the velocity - gradient pdfs coincide for the galilean invariant region  @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in the one - dimensional case .",
    "this suggests that the velocity - difference pdf is contributed to by _ smooth _ parts of the velocity field in the galilean invariant region , and therefore the limits  @xmath31 and  @xmath18 _ are _ interchangeable .",
    "another important result of @xcite is that the @xmath34  anomaly introduced in  @xcite is absent for regular forcing .",
    "we assume that this is true for the multi - dimensional case as well . under this assumption",
    ", the  @xmath29 term in the multi - dimensional case should be expanded as @xmath35    this is the only assumption we use in what follows .",
    "we refer the reader to papers  @xcite for more details and discussions on the underlying ideas .",
    "we will see that this assumption is self - consistent ; the anomaly @xmath36 can be found from the conditions of positivity , finiteness , and normalizability of the pdf .",
    "these conditions can be easily imposed on the  pdf in @xmath37-space .",
    "we therefore transform eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) to @xmath37-space , using : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the measure in @xmath40-dimensional space of the elements of the matrix  @xmath41 . in the steady state",
    ", the equation takes the form : @xmath42p =- ap .",
    "\\label{fp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the general equation for the  pdf .",
    "the force in this equation can have different symmetry properties , which correspond to different values of the parameter  @xmath43 in  ( [ force ] ) .",
    "no restrictions have so far been imposed on the velocity field either .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) can be simplified for the _ gradient _ force  @xmath44 .",
    "this choice corresponds to  @xmath45 and allows us to look for a solution in the factorized form : @xmath46\\,{\\tilde p}({\\tilde u})\\,\\ , , \\label{factorization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath47 denotes the symmetric part of the matrix  @xmath48 .",
    "physically , this means that we have restricted our consideration to _ gradient _ fluctuations of the velocity field , @xmath49 .",
    "we refer to this case as multi - dimensional burgers turbulence .",
    "it was considered by completely different methods in  @xcite .",
    "the spirit of our method is most close to the consideration of  @xcite .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) with ansatz  ( [ factorization ] ) can be cast into the following form : @xmath50{\\tilde p}=-a{\\tilde p}. \\label{fp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we will consider only the function  @xmath51 , and will omit the overtilde sign .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) and  ( [ fp2 ] ) help to reveal the physical sense of the @xmath36  anomaly . integrating these equations with respect to  @xmath52",
    "one gets :    @xmath53    which means that this anomaly describes the average measure loss due to compressibility and presence of shocks .",
    "it can also be interpreted as the mean rate of density accumulation on shocks in the lagrangian picture :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the lagrangian coordinate , @xmath52 represents the smooth part of the velocity field , and @xmath56 .",
    "the lagrangian pdf  @xmath57 and the eulerian pdf  @xmath58 are related as follows :    @xmath59    that leads to eq .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) .",
    "we note an interesting analogy with a mean field approximation : @xmath36 is introduced as the mean field in the dynamical equations and then is found self - consistently from eq .",
    "( [ fp2 ] ) .",
    "the interpretation  ( [ langevin ] ) is important , since it allows one to introduce the anomaly on the level of the stochastic langevin equation .    in general",
    ", the pdf should depend only on invariants with respect to space rotations .",
    "for the @xmath0-dimensional space , there are exactly  @xmath0 such invariants , which can be chosen as the eigenvalues of the matrix  @xmath60 .",
    "let us denote them as @xmath61 .",
    "( [ fp2 ] ) can be rewritten for the function @xmath62 depending on only these variables :    @xmath63p + \\left ( \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{d}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\lambda_k } \\right)^2 p \\nonumber \\\\ & + 2 \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{d } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\lambda_k}\\right)^2p   + \\sum\\limits_{i , k}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i-\\lambda_k}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i}-\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\lambda_k}\\right)p =- ap . \\label{fp3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to derive this equation we used the following expression for the matrix laplacian , known in the theory of matrix models  @xcite : @xmath64    equation  ( [ fp3 ] ) has an infinite number of solutions .",
    "the physically reasonable solution should satisfy conditions of positivity , finiteness , and normalizability ; exactly in the same manner as the ground state is determined in quantum mechanics .",
    "the solution should also be symmetrical with respect to the arguments  @xmath65 .",
    "these conditions should determine the unknown parameter  @xmath36 .",
    "this parameter depends only on the symmetry properties of the external force and on the space dimensionality .    as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the asymptotics of the solutions can be found by balancing different terms in eq .",
    "( [ fp3 ] ) .",
    "if we balance the advective and force terms , we will get the pdf tail in the region where the dissipative effects are negligible . in the one - dimensional case this corresponds to the right tail of the pdf .",
    "this tail decays hyper - exponentially fast . in the multi - dimensional case",
    "the analogous asymptotic should have the form : @xmath66 .",
    "the function  @xmath67 should be symmetric with respect to its arguments  @xmath65 .",
    "the asymptotic can be simply found for large positive @xmath68 s in the direction close to @xmath69 : @xmath70\\,\\ , ,   \\label{asymptotics1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",
    "the same asymptotic for large @xmath68 can also be obtained by the instanton methods  @xcite applied directly to quantum mechanics  ( [ fp3 ] ) .",
    "the tail , corresponding to large negative  @xmath68 s ( the  left \" tail ) decays rather slowly .",
    "the explanation is simple .",
    "burgers shocks always have negative velocity jumps , and therefore large positive velocity gradients are less probable than large negative ones",
    ". the left tail is determined by large negative gradients , and to obtain it we should neglect the force term in  ( [ fp3 ] ) . we find : @xmath72 where @xmath73  is some function , and @xmath74 are @xmath75  invariants of the characterictic equations for  ( [ fp3 ] ) .",
    "the finite solution which is non - vanishing for @xmath69 has the form :    @xmath76    the function obtained from ( [ fp3 ] ) should be normalized with respect to the flat measure in the @xmath77-dimensional space of elements of the symmetric matrix  @xmath60 . in @xmath68-space , this normalization is performed as follows :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the vandermonde determinant ; for details , see @xcite .",
    "in this section we solve eq .",
    "( [ fp3 ] ) numerically in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the purpose of these calculations is to show that eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) with the anomaly term  ( [ ope ] ) does have a steady state , at least for the gradient velocity field .",
    "we have used the relaxation method and started with some arbitrary but _ symmetrical _ initial distribution . the numerical value for the anomaly turned out to be  @xmath80 .",
    "the pdf has hyper - exponential and power - like tails and is presented in  fig .",
    "the pdf is normalized according to ( [ normalization ] ) . plotted on the horizontal axes are  @xmath81  and  @xmath82 .",
    "[ tbp ]    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the same pdf for the diagonal direction @xmath83 .",
    "the left tail decays as  @xmath84 , the right tail asymptotic is  @xmath85 , in agreement with  ( [ asymptotics1 ] ) and  ( [ asymptotics2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath86  is plotted vs. @xmath87 .",
    "the crucial assumption in our treatment of the dissipative anomaly is the assumption that only smooth parts of the velocity field contribute to the velocity-_difference _  pdf . after the velocity - gradient @xmath19  function  ( [ zfunction ] )",
    "is found , the velocity - difference @xmath19  function can be constructed as follows :      i.e. , we simply changed @xmath89 in  ( [ zfunction ] ) .",
    "the fourier transform with respect to @xmath90 will then give the velocity - difference  pdf . as an example",
    ", let us consider the longitudinal velocity - difference pdf :      where  @xmath92 is a unit vector in the direction of  @xmath93 . since  @xmath94 does not depend on  @xmath92 , one can average with respect to all possible directions of this vector and get the following result :          in general ,  @xmath97 can be represented as  @xmath98 . if we assume that for large negative  @xmath99 the integral  ( [ p_l - integral ] ) is contributed to by the force - free asymptotic  ( [ left ] ) , we immediately get the left tail asymptotic for the longitudinal velocity - difference pdf :      analogously , one can obtain a pdf for @xmath101 . for this purpose one should set @xmath102 .",
    "such a pdf was investigated numerically in  @xcite , though the  @xmath103 number was not large enough to obtain the inertial range .    finally , we would like to note that the absence of the @xmath34  anomaly , that we assumed in our consideration , can be not a universal fact .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite that different dissipative regularizations ( e.g. hyper - dissipation @xmath104 ) can lead to different steady states .",
    "this assumption is natural for the language of the ope : different dissipative operators should have different expansion coefficients  @xmath36 and  @xmath105 ( we use the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , some analog of the @xmath34 anomaly can also be present in eq .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) , since it describes a general velocity field , without  gradient \" restriction  ( [ factorization ] ) .",
    "i am indebted to a.  polyakov and v.  yakhot for many important discussions and comments .",
    "i would also like to thank t.  gotoh , v.  gurarie , and r.  kraichnan for useful conversations , d.  uzdensky for helpful discussions on both the physics and the numerics of the problem , and t.  munsat for valuable remarks on the style of the paper ."
