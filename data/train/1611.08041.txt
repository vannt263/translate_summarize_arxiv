    "during a first - order phase transition , the system has to overcome a free energy barrier in order to transform to the thermodynamically stable phase .",
    "when this process is driven only by thermal fluctuations , it is called _ homogeneous nucleation_. more often , nucleation is facilitated by external surfaces and the corresponding process is known as _",
    "heterogeneous nucleation_. nucleation is an important process for its many practical applications , as it is ubiquitous in various types of technologically important materials such as metals , semiconductors , pharmaceuticals , and foods .",
    "nucleation has been thoroughly studied ( for recent reviews see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but it is still not entirely understood , due to the experimental difficulty in accessing the small size of the crystalline nuclei involved in the transition ( which is of the order of 10 - 1000 molecules in usual conditions ) .",
    "the difficulty in observing the nucleation process at the microscopic level has profound repercussions not only on our theoretical understanding , but also on the practical task of estimating nucleation rates , where considerable disagreements between experimental measurements and numerical predictions are often reported even for the simplest systems .",
    "one notable example is the condensation of argon , a noble gas , where reports of theoretical and experimentally measured nucleation rates can differ even by 26 orders of magnitude  @xcite .    a molecular system whose crystallization represents the most important physical transformation on earth is water .",
    "understanding nucleation of water is of fundamental importance in many industrial and natural processes .",
    "for example , the nucleation of ice nuclei in atmospheric clouds is an important factor in establishing earth s radiation budget .",
    "our lack of understanding of the freezing mechanisms of water in clouds has a negative impact on many climate models : ice crystals control the amount of light reflected by clouds , which is one of the largest unknown parameters that affect atmospheric warming  @xcite    differently from atomic and molecular systems , colloidal systems are characterized by lengthscales ( of the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 m ) and timescales ( of the order of seconds ) that can be accessed at a single particle level with microscopy techniques .",
    "moreover , the interactions between colloids are mediated by fast degrees of freedom ( like the solvent ) ; these effective interactions  @xcite can be controlled to a high degree by changing a few external parameters , like the quality and concentration of the dissolved salts .",
    "these considerations give to colloidal suspensions the quality of ideal systems , where our theoretical understanding of crystallization can be benchmarked against accurate experimental results .",
    "for a recent review of nucleation in colloidal systems see ref .",
    "it is surprising to observe that even for the simplest colloidal system , i.e. colloidal hard spheres  @xcite , discrepancies between the observed and predicted nucleation rates can be as big as ten orders of magnitude  @xcite . while numerical simulations have found a rapid increase of the nucleation rate with increasing colloid volume fraction @xmath2 , growing by more than 15 orders of magnitude from @xmath3 to @xmath4  @xcite , experiments on both polymethyl methacrylate and polystyrene microgel systems , instead report nucleation rates that are much less sensitive to volume fraction  @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most general understanding of nucleation is embodied in classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite .",
    "focusing here on the liquid - to - solid transition , the process starts from small crystalline nuclei that spontaneously form in the supercooled liquid from thermal fluctuations . at any temperature below the melting temperature",
    ", there is a characteristic size at which these nuclei are equally likely to dissolve or to grow until the liquid - to - solid transition is complete .",
    "this size is called _ critical nucleus size_. classical nucleation theory rests on the assumption that the critical nucleus is amenable to a thermodynamic description , and that the process is effectively one - dimensional , meaning that it can be described by just one reaction coordinate , with all order parameters involved in the transition proceeding simultaneously .",
    "the idea of describing crystal nucleation as a one - dimensional process is borrowed from first - order phase transitions between phases with the same symmetry , most notably the gas - liquid nucleation , or its reverse process , cavitation . but the liquid - to - solid phase transition is different , as both the translational and orientational symmetries of the liquid are broken with crystallization .",
    "this is seen by expanding the density of the crystal in its fourier components  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density of the liquid phase , @xmath7 is the fractional density change at freezing , and @xmath8 are the fourier components associated with the crystalline periodic structure ( @xmath9 for the liquid phase ) .",
    "the liquid - to - solid transition is thus associated with an infinite number of order parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath8 ) . by assuming the crystal to be harmonic at melting",
    ", all high order order parameters can be related to @xmath11 . in this effective case ,",
    "the transition is thus represented by two order parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are associated with translational and orientational order respectively .",
    "we note , however , that the latter still includes translational order due to the constraint on the wave vector , @xmath12 , which is a feature of the density functional theory of crystallization .",
    "the fact that nucleation is inherently multi - dimensional is obvious in all those systems where the breaking of positional and orientational order occurs at different temperatures , the most famous example being the freezing of two dimensional hard disks . here , between the liquid and solid phases",
    ", an intermediate phase appears , called the hexatic phase , characterized by quasi - long range orientational order , but short - range positional order . in one of the most important cases of algorithmic development in recent years  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the transition between the liquid and hexatic phase is first - order , while the hexatic - to - solid is a second order transition .    but a decoupling of translational and orientational order can occur even when both symmetries break down simultaneously as in the case of crystallization in three dimensions .",
    "note that translational ordering automatically accompanies orientational ordering .",
    "in particular , in the next sections we show examples where two - step ordering can be identified prior to the transition : in the first step crystallization involves an increase of orientational order even in the liquid state , only later followed by a change of density ( positional order ) . this decoupling can be intuitively understood on the basis that liquids are difficult to compress , and some order has to appear for realizing efficient packing before density can increase .    in this article",
    ", we will consider several examples of two - step crystallization .",
    "the term `` two - step '' was originally applied to crystallization processes which involved an intermediate step corresponding to metastable phases where nucleation occurs at a higher rate .",
    "it has then been extended to describe crystallization processes that are continuous , but where nucleation occurs in preordered regions of the melt",
    ". we will start with considering how a metastable gas - liquid phase separation alters the nucleation pathway by adding an intermediate step , i.e. the formation of a dense liquid droplet , whose high density considerably increases the crystallization rate .",
    "we will then consider examples where the nucleation pathway occurs through crystallization precursors spontaneously formed in melts . in this case",
    "we show that the liquid - to - solid transition is effectively driven by structural fluctuations , and the nuclei reach their bulk density only when their size considerably exceeds the critical nucleus size . in the case of spherically symmetric interaction potentials , we show that crystallization occurs in regions of high crystal - like bond - orientational order , and that these regions effectively select the polymorph that will be nucleated from them .",
    "connection are made also with vitrification phenomena for hard spheres , in which we associate crystalline orientational order with slow regions in the system , and identify five - fold symmetric regions as inhibitors of crystallization .",
    "it is worth stressing that such bond orientational ordering does not accompany the density change .",
    "we will then focus on the special case of water , where the presence of directional hydrogen bonds considerably alters the pathway to nucleation .",
    "all these indicate that a liquid is not a homogeneous isotropic state at the microscopic level , but generally tends to have more local structural order to lower its free energy .",
    "this tendency , which increases for a lower temperature , has an impact on the structural and dynamical properties of a supercooled liquid state , which further influences crystal nucleation and vitrification @xcite . in this article",
    ", we consider only a ( nearly ) single - component system , where density and bond orientational order are two important order parameters to describe the liquid state .",
    "however , for a multi - component system , we need an additional order parameter , local composition , to describe it . here",
    "we do not discuss this important but difficult case .",
    "we are going to show that the multiple - order - parameter description is crucial to understand the low - temperature phenomena seen in a supercooled liquid state .",
    "the simplest and most general understanding of nucleation is embodied in classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite . focusing here on the liquid - to - solid transition , the process starts from small crystalline nuclei that spontaneously form in the supercooled liquid from thermal fluctuations . a critical nucleus size , at which these nuclei are equally likely to dissolve or to grow , can be easily obtained from the gibbs - thomson equation .",
    "the chemical potential of a solid particle inside a nucleus of size @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bulk chemical potential of the solid phase , @xmath16 is the interfacial tension , and @xmath17 is the bulk density of the solid . at the critical nucleus size @xmath18 , the crystalline nucleus is in equilibrium with the liquid phase , @xmath19 , from which we obtain @xmath20    below the critical nucleus size",
    ", the clusters made of @xmath21 particles are thermally equilibrated at all times , meaning that they are evolving in a free energy landscape where the nucleation rate density can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a kinetic factor , and @xmath24 is the height of the free energy barrier separating the liquid from the solid phase .",
    "here @xmath25 is the number of particles in the critical nucleus . according to cnt",
    ", the kinetic term takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density , @xmath28 is the molecular mass , @xmath29 is the attachment rate of particles to the critical nucleus , and @xmath30 is the curvature of the barrier at the critical nucleus size @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath31 is also known as the zeldovich factor .",
    "the free energy barrier @xmath32 is instead derived from a competition between a bulk term which accounts for the free energy gain of transforming to the stable phase , and a surface term which expresses the free energy penalty in creating a liquid / solid interface @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a numerical factor that depends on the shape of the nucleus ( @xmath35 for a spherical nucleus ) , @xmath36 is the liquid - solid chemical potential difference , and @xmath16 is the liquid - crystal surface tension .    here",
    "it is worth mentioning that the transport crucial for crystal nucleation and growth is not controlled by viscosity , but by translational diffusion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this is important below the melting point , where the stokes - einstein relation rather significantly breaks down .    in the case of heterogeneous nucleation",
    ", the free energy barrier is decreased by a geometrical factor @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the contact angle of the crystal nucleus with the external surface .",
    "classical nucleation theory provides a successful framework to understand and analyze data from nucleation for a large variety of processes .",
    "but , on quantitative level , its predictions are hard to test , as small changes in the experimental conditions can significantly impact the yield rates of crystallization . in the introduction section",
    ", we highlighted the large discrepancies in the nucleation rates obtained experimentally and theoretically for arguably the simplest system that exhibits a liquid - to - solid transition , i.e. colloidal hard spheres .",
    "several attempts have been made at solving this inconsistency , but no consensus has been found yet .",
    "approximations in the calculations of nucleation rates can be found both for experiments and simulations , and explanations are being proposed which take into account the limitations of both methods .",
    "in one recent proposal  @xcite , the effects of the gravitational fields on the experimental nucleation rates are considered .",
    "the difficulty of exactly density matching colloidal samples implies that gravitational lengths are not negligibly short compared to the size of colloidal systems .",
    "the coupling between the gravitational force with long range hydrodynamic effects can then cause an increase of density fluctuations in the sample , followed by an increase of nucleation rates compared to the gravity - free case .",
    "a different proposal  @xcite instead focuses directly on hydrodynamic interactions , which are often neglected in simulations .",
    "it is argued that hydrodynamic interactions can effectively increase nucleation rates to account for the discrepancy between experiments and simulations . to this day ,",
    "consensus on the resolution of the discrepancy in nucleation rates has not been found .",
    "classical nucleation theory rests on several approximations .",
    "the most important one is the so - called _ capillarity approximation _ , which is the assumption that small crystalline nuclei ( or the order of 100 of particles ) are still amenable to a thermodynamic description , as they retain the same properties of the bulk solid .",
    "this assumption has been challenged in many studies  @xcite .    , and the average density at the center of mass is plotted against the radius @xmath13 of the nucleus . @xmath39 and @xmath17 are the equilibrium densities of the fluid and of the crystal respectively , while @xmath18 is the critical nucleus radius.,width=302 ]    as an example we consider here a hard sphere system at reduced pressure @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the diameter of the spheres ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at these conditions",
    "the critical nucleus size consists approximately of @xmath43 spheres , and direct crystallization events can be observed in simulations . by gathering statistics on many independent crystallization events , in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_nucleus ] we plot the average density at the center of mass of the nucleus as a function if its radius @xmath13 .",
    "density is normalized with the density of the fluid @xmath6 and of the solid @xmath17 at their equilibrium values , so that it is @xmath44 in the bulk @xmath45 solid , and @xmath46 in the metastable liquid phase .",
    "the radius is instead scaled with the critical radius @xmath18 . from the figure",
    "we can see that at equilibrium , @xmath47 , the density at the center of the nucleus is far below the equilibrium density of the crystal @xmath48 .",
    "another parameter that is not well described by the capillarity approximation is the surface tension @xmath16 .",
    "several studies have found that the surface free energy cost at equilibrium is not the relevant free energy penalty for nucleation , both in metals and charged colloids  @xcite .    among the many theoretical treatments that go beyond the capillary approximation",
    "see for example ref .",
    "@xcite : these include modifications of cnt ( as for example introducing a lenghtscale - dependent surface tension , i.e. tolman length )  @xcite , and new applications like density functional theory  @xcite and kinetic nucleation theory  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in most descriptions of nucleation , the melt is described as structure - less and homogeneous .",
    "several studies have shown instead that the supercooled state contains a lot of structural order aside from crystalline order  @xcite .",
    "for hard spheres , for example , the competition between crystalline order and icosahedral ( or five - fold symmetric ) order plays a big role in the nucleation process , and on its avoidance  @xcite . for systems with a metastable critical point ,",
    "e.g. with short - range attractions , spatial heterogeneity due to critical fluctuations also plays a big role  @xcite .",
    "cnt rests on the assumption that the nucleation process can be described by just one reaction coordinate , and that all order parameters involved in the transition proceed simultaneously .",
    "several works have addressed this assumption in systems where different reaction coordinates can be followed simultaneously during nucleation , and have demonstrated that a single - order parameter description fails at capturing important aspects of the transition  @xcite . in the following we will focus on this particular aspect of the nucleation process , and show how new insights can be obtained with a multi - dimensional ( or , multi - order - parameter ) representation of the transition .    in colloidal systems , unlike metals and noble gases , polydispersity plays a big role in the crystallization process . formally speaking",
    ", a continuous polydispersity introduces a new order parameter for each specie in the mixture  @xcite . at high polydispersities , crystallization requires fractionation , and generally destabilizes the crystal . at low polydispersities , it is possible to treat the system like an effective one - component system , but care has to be taken in describing the nucleation process , as several thermodynamic quantities are very sensitive to polydispersity , such as surface tension  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that kinetic effects can have a profound impact on the crystallization process .",
    "kinetic effects become especially important at high supercooling , where diffusion becomes the rate limiting process for both nucleation and crystal growth . according to classical nucleation theory , the kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : k ] ) is controlled by a thermally activated process  @xcite , usually thermal diffusion ( at low temperatures diffusivity and viscosity can have different activation energies , i.e. stokes - einstein violation ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the atomic jump distance in the liquid . in the crystallization of a lennard - jones system  @xcite , it was shown that the crystallization rate predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : k2 ] ) is two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured one .",
    "this suggests that , for simple monoatomic systems , the kinetic factor is not controlled by thermally activated processes .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the growth of the lennard - jones crystal  @xcite where the crystallization rates were found to be independent of diffusion , but determined by the ideal gas thermal velocity @xmath51 .",
    "this means that , at high supercooling , crystal growth can proceed despite diffusive processes becoming negligible , even below the glass transition temperature . in a series of experiments  @xcite on molecular liquids ( both organic and inorganic glass formers )",
    ", it was discovered that the crystal growth rate can display an unusual enhancement below the glass transition temperature .",
    "the growth rate becomes orders of magnitude faster than expected for diffusion - controlled growth , in conflict with the established view that the kinetic barrier for crystallization is similar to that for diffusion .",
    "simulations of hard spheres have also shown crystallization without diffusion  @xcite , that the static properties of the crystals are not much affected by dynamics  @xcite , and that the dynamics in a crystallizing glass becomes intermittent ( avalanche like )  @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts at describing the process by which particles move from the liquid to the crystal without assuming an activated process analogous to that which governs self - diffusion .",
    "these include the substitution of diffusion with secondary relaxations  @xcite ( the so called @xmath52 processes ) , or by taking into account the extensional stress around crystals growing inside a glass of lower density  @xcite . despite these attempts",
    ", a clear explanation is still lacking .",
    "for example , simulations of binary metallic glasses have instead confirmed diffusional growth of the interface  @xcite .",
    "these simulations have noticed a connection between the attachment rate of liquid particles to the crystal surface with the width of the surface , which suggests that the structural properties of the melt , and its preordering in advance of the front propagation , might play a bigger role than dynamics .",
    "we will investigate the role of structural preordering of the fluid in detail in section  [ sec : precursors ] .    despite its limitations , cnt is still our best effective theory of the nucleation process . rather than focusing on the underlying symmetries ( translational and orientational order ) cnt uses the size of the nucleus as its reaction coordinate , and gives a unified description of nucleation in a big variety of systems .",
    "but the simplifications that are adopted ( capillarity approximation , and reduction to a one - dimensional description ) hide a lot of the phenomenology of the nucleation process , and in the next sections we unveil some of the steps that have been made in understanding nucleation from a microscopic perspective .",
    "one of the first demonstrations of a non - classical pathway to nucleation was given by ten wolde and frenkel  @xcite .",
    "they considered how the crystallization pathway is influenced by the presence of a metastable gas - liquid transition , whose order parameter is a scalar density field .",
    "the model considered was an adapted lennard - jones potential , with a hard - repulsion at contact , and short - range attraction .",
    "in soft matter systems , reducing the range of the attractions pushes the gas - liquid critical point to lower temperatures , where it eventually becomes metastable with respect to crystallization  @xcite .",
    "the parameters were chosen in order to have a critical point lying approximately 20% below the equilibrium crystallization curve , a condition that is found to be common in globular protein solutions . according to the study , a novel crystallization pathway was found in proximity of the gas - liquid critical point . instead of direct nucleation from the gas phase ( one - step crystallization ) ,",
    "the system was found to crystallize inside disordered liquid regions of higher density that form due to critical density fluctuations .",
    "this process is referred as two - step crystallization : the first step involves the formation of dense liquid regions , and the second step is the nucleation of the crystal phase inside these dense regions . in the original work  @xcite the formation of dense precursors",
    "was attributed to the long - range density fluctuations that originate from the presence of the metastable critical point .",
    "it is thus expected that the nucleation rate would have maximum around the critical point .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has instead found that that the nucleation rate monotonically increases going from the supercritical region towards the two - phase coexistence region .",
    "the two - step mechanism is thus not strictly due to critical fluctuations , but rather to the formation of a dense liquid phase that is thermodynamically stabilized below the critical point .",
    "away from the metastable critical point , the system was found to crystallize classically in one step , where densification and structural ordering happen simultaneously .",
    "thus it was demonstrated how a very simple model ( spheres with short range attractions ) can display very complex crystallization behavior depending on the thermodynamic parameters  @xcite .    in experiments , two - step pathways",
    "have been first considered in protein crystallization  @xcite , most notably lysozyme , but were quickly observed also in colloidal systems  @xcite .",
    "numerous examples of two - step crystallization from solutions has been reported in the last years , and several reviews have been written on the subject  @xcite .",
    "probably the best evidence for two - step nucleation pathways came from theoretical investigations , where microscopic information is readily available .",
    "the main theoretical tool for the study of crystallization in simple model systems are density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and molecular simulations  .",
    "two - step crystallization pathways have been suggested to occur also outside the region of stability of the dense fluid phase . in this case , crystallization starts inside metastable liquid drops ( also called pre - nucleation clusters  @xcite ) whose lifetime has to be long enough to promote nucleation .",
    "the first example came from experimental studies of lysozyme crystals , which were found to crystallize more easily just outside the metastable gas - liquid phase separation transition  @xcite .",
    "similar processes have been found in both small molecules , like glycine  @xcite and calcium carbonate  @xcite , and colloidal systems  @xcite .",
    "two - step crystallization in absence of a metastable liquid phase was also confirmed theoretically in spin models  @xcite and density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "even the presence of metastable liquid phases might not be a necessary condition , as several studies have reported two - step nucleation pathways in systems where a dense fluid phase does not exist .",
    "hard spheres , due to the lack of attractive interactions , are an example of such systems : the stable phases are a fluid phase and close - packed crystalline phases , such as hcp , fcc and the phase obtained by random stacking of hcp and fcc layers .",
    "the large size of colloidal particles means that the lengthscales and timescales can be ( relatively ) easily observed experimentally , and many classical experiments have examined the process of crystal nucleation in microscopic detail  @xcite . also simulations have studied in detail the composition , shape and free energy barrier to nucleation  @xcite .",
    "leveraging the sensibility of light scattering experiments to density fluctuations , dense amorphous precursors were reported in colloidal hard spheres  @xcite , pmma particles  @xcite , and microgel colloids  @xcite .",
    "these experiments were also corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .    whether dense precursors can be formed in systems without a metastable fluid - fluid demixing transition ( like hard spheres )",
    "is not so clear physically and has been debated in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite we argued that orientational order foreshadows translational order in hard - spheres , i.e. that the nucleation process is accompanied by a faster increase of bond - orientational order than translational order .",
    "this also implies that precursor regions , defined as the regions of the melt from which the critical nucleus will emerge from , are better characterized by bond orientational order than density . in the next section",

    "the idea of studying crystallization under external fields by studying the effects of the field on the bond orientational order is also a new direction for future research , which has been considered for example in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of crystallization in sheared suspensions .",
    "there has been some debate in the literature as to whether the nuclei appear in dense - precursors  @xcite or in bond - orientational - ordered precursors  @xcite .",
    "a very recent  @xcite re - analysis of the simulation trajectories of ref .",
    "@xcite ( `` density - first '' case ) showed a simultaneous increase of density and bond - orientational order leading up to nucleation . as we observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] there is a ( weak ) linear coupling between bond - orientational order and density which ensures that fluctuations toward high bond - orientational order will on average lead to a higher density than the melt .",
    "this also means , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , that following crystal nucleation in time will lead to a simultaneous increase of density and bond - orientational order , as was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this consideration may also have an implication on light scattering results of crystal nucleation @xcite .",
    "light scattering measurements are basically sensitive to the development of translational order , but not to that of bond orientational order . thus , the nucleation process can only be followed as soon as the scattering from the [ 111 ] plane is observed , but still before the formation of any higher order peaks .",
    "at these resolutions , the distance between [ 111 ] planes is observed to be considerably shorter than the nearest neighbour spacing in the remaining melt , which signals that densification is also occurring during the formation of 2d sheets of hexagonal order .",
    "the fact that both order parameters are changing during the transition , does not mean that their role is the same .",
    "positional order and orientational order are characterized by their spatial correlation functions .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite , in both mono- and poly - disperse systems , that with supercooling ( compression over the freezing pressure ) hard - spheres rapidly develop orientational order with negligible signs of increase in translational order : while the correlation length of positional correlation stays constant with supercooling , the bond - orientational correlation length steadily increases , almost doubling its size with respect to fluid state below the freezing pressure .",
    "so there is a clear decoupling between orientational and positional order , even if it is not strong enough to sustain an intermediate phase between the fluid and crystal ( analogous to the hexatic phase in two - dimensional hard - disks  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the simple first - order nature of the fluid - to - solid transition , dictates a discontinuous change of positional and orientational order , and instead of two - step crystallization ( like what happens near a metastable critical point ) it is more appropriate to speak of precursors mediated crystallization in hard sphere like systems .    as we have observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , the two order parameters do not have symmetric roles in the free energy , and while higher bond - orientational order corresponds to higher density , the opposite is not true . as we discussed in section",
    "[ sec : two - step ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) , the linear coupling between the two order parameter is weaker than the term @xmath60 , and higher density does not imply higher bond - orientational order .",
    "in fact , there are many local configurations which increase the density locally , but do not increase crystalline bond - orientational order .",
    "the most notable of these structures are icosahedral clusters , which correspond to the highest local packing of hard - spheres , but that are incompatible with crystalline bond - orientational order .",
    "while at the fluid - to - solid transition , both order parameters become long - ranged , the transition state ( the critical nucleus ) has a more developed bond - orientational order , while the density is still comparatively low compared to the bulk crystal density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "confocal experiments have the great potential of following the early stages of the nucleation process , and they do confirm a more rapid development of orientational order over densification  @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of the ideas presented in the previous section is their application to polymorph selection , which has attracted a lot of investigations  .",
    "the observation that structuring foreshadows densification and crystallization leads to the idea that these pre - structured regions ( precursors ) could play a role in determining which polymorph is being nucleated .",
    "this idea requires the precursors to have some underlying symmetry that is common with the crystalline structures that are nucleated from them .",
    "such behavior was observed for hard spheres , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first studies of polymorph selection from precursor regions were done with the gaussian core model ( gcm ) , which is a good model for the effective interaction between the centers of mass of polymers dispersed in a good solvent  @xcite .",
    "the model presents two stable crystalline phases : the fcc at low pressures , and the bcc phase at high pressures .",
    "the density of the bcc phase is lower than the fcc phase , and it becomes lower than the density of the fluid phase above a certain pressure , after which re - entrant melting is observed .",
    "nucleation in the gcm model was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the pre - structured cloud surrounding the nuclei was taken into account to obtain a better description of the transition . ref .",
    "@xcite then proposed a link between the precursor regions and the crystal phase which was nucleated from them .",
    "contrary to thermodynamic predictions , it noted that the gcm model has a kinetic preference for the bcc phase , even in regions where the stable phase is fcc .",
    "@xcite then found that the nuclei have a mixed nature , not consisting of a single polymorph , and that the kinetic pathway selected during nucleation persists even when the nucleus is many times above its critical size .",
    "another example comes from hard spheres . here",
    "the relevant crystalline structures are the close - packed fcc and hcp crystals . despite a negligible bulk free energy difference ( of the order of @xmath66 of the thermal energy in favor of fcc  @xcite )",
    ", simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite have both found that nucleation predominantly forms fcc .",
    "this preference for the fcc crystal form is indeed found in the precursor regions  @xcite , which show a clear preference for fcc - like local environments over the hcp - like ones .",
    "this somehow highlights the idea that the kinetic pathway by which nuclei appear plays a fundamental role in polymorph selection .",
    "the melt is not simply a structure - less background where nucleation can occur homogeneously , but it is instead composed of local structures with different symmetries .",
    "symmetries that are compatible with long - range crystalline order serve as precursors , and their relative abundance dictates the likelihood of formation of a specific polymorph .",
    "structures found in the supercooled melt are most often incompatible with crystalline order .",

    "frustration effects of local structures of five - fold symmetry on crystallization were also discussed in two - dimensional single - component spin liquids @xcite .",

    "it was found that open crystalline structures ( as the structure of ice in water ) are instead comparatively more stable to disorder .",
    "angular disorder , in particular , was shown to have little effect on the crystallizability of systems with directional interactions  @xcite .",
    "the effects of external fields on precursor regions were also considered  @xcite .",
    "external walls were considered experimentally and numerically in vertically vibrated quasi - two - dimensional granular liquids and two- and three - dimensional colloidal systems respectively  @xcite , showing that the walls enhance structural order in the fluid , in a manner that is consistent with the bulk behavior , under an influence of wall - induced short - range translational ordering ( i.e. , layering ) .",
    "this not only leads to the enhancement of glassy slow dynamics but also may induce heterogeneous nucleation near walls .",
    "@xcite instead considered the effect of rough walls on colloidal suspensions under the effects of gravity , where the suppression of bond orientational order and layering next to the walls results in a strong suppression of nucleation .",
    "also shear was shown to suppress precursor regions  @xcite , while at the same time increasing the rate of growth of crystals .",
    "the interplay between these two effects is at the origin of the non - monotonous crystallization rate as a function of the shear rate  @xcite .      up to now",
    "we have addressed the role of structural heterogeneity in the melt .",
    "this not only promotes crystal nucleation , but also causes heterogeneous dynamics , which may be related to the so - called `` dynamic heterogeneities '' , widely observed in glass - forming liquids .",
    "it is natural to expect that more structurally ordered regions are more stable and have slower dynamics than less ordered regions .",
    "the lifetime of these heterogeneous regions , @xmath67 , is comparable to / much longer than structural relation times for three-/two - dimensional systems respectively @xcite . for hard - sphere systems ( both mono and poly - disperse systems )",
    ", the study of dynamic heterogeneities in supercooled melts has showed that there is a close match between slow regions and regions with high bond - orientational order  @xcite .",
    "this is suggestive of a possible general link between the glass transition and the growing length - scale of structural order , such as bond orientational order , at least for ( nearly ) single - component systems .",
    "a link between static and dynamic properties was found to apply also to system of monodisperse ellipsoids , where lenghtscales corresponding to glassy dynamics , heterogeneous dynamics , and structural order , where all found to diverge at a common volume fraction for both translational and orientational degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we mention that in polydisperse emulsions a link between dynamic heterogeneities and local order was found , but the order corresponds to the development of five - fold symmetric structures  @xcite .",

    "once a glass is formed , devitrification is still possible , but the mechanism is still not fully understood ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : extending ] ) , despite the importance that nucleation from the glassy state has in many systems that have industrial applications , like pharmaceuticals and metallic glasses .",
    "recent investigations  @xcite suggest that the devitrification phenomena is linked to an intermittent dynamic in the melt . during a series of discontinuous events , called _ avalanches _ , a small fraction of particles undergoes rapid motion , which is followed by an increase of the crystalline order in the melt .",

    "this partly explains why water has such a large metastability gap , in which , in absence of impurities , it can persist in its liquid form down to very low temperatures .      the existence of the homogeneous crystallization line , where the relaxation time of the liquid becomes shorter than the homogeneous crystallization time , implies that , at the best of today s knowledge , deeply supercooled liquid states will never be reached at bulk conditions , as already is found in simulations of coarse - grained water models  @xcite .",

    "when we study crystal nucleation by numerical simulations , the choice of order parameters relevant for describing the miscroscopic pathway of crystal nucleation is crucial . in previous researches of ice nucleation ,",
    "the bond orientational order parameter @xmath54 and the hydrogen - bond network topology characterized by six - member rings are often used as key parameters .",
    "these choices are based on the assumption that the stable ice forms at ambient conditions are either hexagonal ice ih or cubic ice ic . however , we recently showed @xcite that these order parameters may not be sufficient for describing the crystal nucleation pathway of water - type liquids @xcite .",

    "both melting lines of the stable ice i phase ( in blue ) and of the metastable ice 0 phase ( in red ) are depicted .",
    "the homogeneous nucleation line , where the liquid phase looses its metastability , is represented with open ( red ) dots and it is seen coinciding with a line of constant thermodynamic driving force with respect to ice 0 ( i.e. , the homogeneous nucleation line is the locus of constant chemical potential difference between the melt and ice 0 ) , rather than the stable phase ice i. in this scenario , it is shown that the presence of a metastable crystalline phase can fundamentally alter the pathway to nucleation in water .",
    "in the above , we show that local structural ordering in a liquid state plays a significant role in both its static and dynamical behavior and non - equilibrium transitions taking place there , such as crystallization and vitrification .",
    "conventional liquid - state theories are based on a physical picture that the liquid state is spatially homogeneous and disordered as in the gas state .",
    "this is of course true on a macroscopic scale , however , may not necessarily be the case on a microscopic scale , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "this local structural ordering can not always be detected by the density order parameter and we need additional order parameters such as bond orientational order parameters .",
    "this indicates that the liquid state can not be specified by the density field alone .",
    "such ordering must be driven by the free energy of the system , and structural ordering should be a consequence of these low free - energy structures .",
    "the many - body nature of this structural ordering is a direct consequence of rotational symmetry selection either by excluded volume effects under dense packing or by directional interactions that often have three - body nature .",
    "as seen in the case of water , structural ordering can play a role also above the melting transition , the density anomaly at @xmath77c being the most famous example of this .",
    "for ordinary fluids , dominated by repulsive interactions ( such as the hard sphere model ) structural order seems to play an increasing role below the melting transition , and a liquid - state theory would require the addition of these features to effectively describe the supercooled state . on noting that crystallization and vitrification take place in a supercooled state",
    ", such an extension may be essential for the description of these phenomena , as shown here ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we note that the former - type ordering can be induced by excluded volume effects under dense packing for systems having rather hard repulsive interactions .",
    "for very soft systems , however , excluded volume effects may not be strong enough for symmetry selection due to large thermal symmetry fluctuations .",
    "so crystallization and vitrification phenomena may have different characters between soft and hard systems .",
    "as reviewed above , pre - ordering in a liquid plays a crucial role in all kinds of phenomena taking place at rather low temperatures , such as crystallization , thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of water - type liquids , liquid - liquid transition , and vitrification @xcite .",
    "pre - ordered regions in a supercooled state act as precursors for crystal nucleation since the local symmetry of these regions should be similar to that of crystals because both symmetries are selected by the same free energy .",
    "this matching of the symmetry leads to a large reduction of the liquid / crystal interfacial energy . when there are more than two polymorphs , a polymorph whose symmetry is similar to precursors should be statistically favored upon nucleation .",
    "this should favor sequential ordering , known as the ostwald step rule , in which such a metastable polymorph is first formed , and then transforms to another polymorph having a lower free energy .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the selection rule explained above , which is based on the symmetry matching and the resulting low interfacial energy cost , is different from the original ostwald step rule , which is based on the liquid / crystal free energy difference .",
    "thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of water - type liquids can be explained by a two - state model that assumes that the anomalies are caused by the formation of locally favored structures , which have static and dynamic properties different from normal liquid structures .",
    "although we did not discuss liquid - liquid transition in this article , it can be viewed as cooperative local structural ordering and the two liquid states can be regarded as the gas and liquid states of locally favored structures @xcite .",
    "finally , vitrification can be viewed as failure of crystallization because of frustration on crystalline preordering or competing ordering @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we mainly focus on ( nearly ) single - component systems . for multi - component systems , which are a quite important class of materials ,",
    "we should consider compositional order in addition to density and structural order .",
    "even for binary mixtures , thus , we need at least three order parameters to describe their liquid state .",
    "this is quite important to understand crystallization and vitrification in multi - component systems .",
    "this important and complex problem , in which one has to deal with a larger number of order parameters and with their couplings , is open for future investigation .",
    "in the present focus article we examined nucleation as a multi - dimensional process in which the transition from the liquid to the solid phase is driven by fluctuations in two ( or more ) order parameters . after a short introduction to classical nucleation theory , we showed that the first non - classical pathways to crystallization were discovered in the context of two - step crystallization in models for proteins or colloids with short - range attractions . in two - step crystallization scenarios ,",
    "nucleation is aided by the the formation of metastable liquid droplets that considerably increase the crystallization rate .",
    "this pathway was found to apply broadly for a variety of systems , from small molecules , to colloidal solutions , and protein solutions .",
    "even more surprisingly , the pathway of densification prior to nucleation was proposed to apply to systems outside the gas - liquid binodal , meaning that nucleation can occur even outside the region of metastability of the liquid droplets",
    ". this may be worth further investigation .    in the absence of a metastable liquid - gas phase separation , recent simulation and experimental work on colloidal systems",
    "have shown that , for spherically symmetric interactions , the precursor field is not density but bond orientational order .",
    "nucleation occurs first in regions with high bond orientational order , which then compactify as crystallization proceeds .",
    "this is quite natural , on noting that an increase in orientational order is necessary for compactification of a dense system .",
    "moreover , with a high degree of orientational symmetry , the precursor regions can select the type of polymorph which will nucleate from it .",
    "several simulation results have shown that the polymorph that has been selected during nucleation can persist to sizes far bigger than the critical size .",
    "the nucleation process , i.e. the first stage of formation of tiny crystal nuclei , has a fundamental impact on the final state , or the macroscale structure .",
    "we also touched upon the relation between precursor regions and heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids , and the effect of external fields ( walls and shear ) on these regions .",
    "we then considered the case of water .",
    "water has many unique thermodynamic and dynamic properties .",
    "the study of the nucleation pathway for both the translational and orientational field has shed new light on these properties .",
    "the translational order parameter field was described in terms of a new structural parameter ( @xmath81 ) which was used to divide the population of water structures in two states . a low - energy , high volume , ordered state ( at high values of @xmath81 ) , and a high - energy , low volume and disordered state ( at small values of @xmath81 ) .",
    "the two - state model that derives from this microscopic description is able to quantitatively capture the anomalous behavior of water .",
    "the orientational order of water is instead captured by another order parameter , @xmath79 .",
    "we have shown that the development of orientational order , and the formation of small crystalline nuclei could be influenced by a new metastable phase , ice 0 , whose structure is intermediate between that of the stable ice forms and of the supercooled liquid state .    finally , we discuss the general implications of this type of approach in our understanding of liquid - associated phenomena and mention important open problems .",
    "we hope that a liquid - state theory constructed on the basis of multiple order parameters and their static and dynamical couplings will be developed in the near future , and contribute to a better understanding of these fundamental open problems .",
