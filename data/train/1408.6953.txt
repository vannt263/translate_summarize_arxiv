    "in the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , given the number of light neutrino species , the abundances of light elements d , @xmath14he , @xmath6he ( hereafter he ) and @xmath15li depend only on one cosmological parameter , the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath16 , which is related to the baryon density parameter @xmath17 , the present ratio of the baryon mass density to the critical density of the universe , by the expression 10@xmath18@xmath16 = 273.9 @xmath19 , where @xmath20  =  @xmath21/100  km  s@xmath22  mpc@xmath22 and @xmath21 is the present value of the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "because of the strong dependence of the d / h abundance ratio on @xmath19 while the he mass fraction depends only logarithmically on the baryon density , deuterium is the light element of choice for determining the baryon mass fraction .",
    "its abundance can accurately be measured in high - redshift low - metallicity qso ly@xmath23 absorption systems .",
    "although the data are still scarce  there are only ten absorption systems for which such a d / h measurement has been carried out @xcite  the measurements appear to converge to a mean primordial value d / h  @xmath24  ( 2.5 - 2.9 )  @xmath9  10@xmath10 , which corresponds to @xmath19  @xmath24  0.0222 - 0.0223 @xcite .",
    "this estimate of @xmath19 is in excellent agreeement with the value of 0.0221 - 0.0222 obtained from studies of the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with _ wmap _ and _ planck _ @xcite .",
    "however , although deuterium is sufficient to derive the baryonic mass density from bbn , accurate measurements of the primordial he abundance @xmath7 are also needed as it plays a crucial role in determining cosmological parameters .",
    "first , it is needed to check the consistency of sbbn since this requires knowledge of the primordial abundances of at least two different relic elements .",
    "second , while he is not a sensitive baryometer , its primordial abundance is much more sensitive to a non - standard , early universe expansion rate and thus provides stronger constraints on non - standard physics , as compared to other primordial light elements .",
    "thus the primordial helium abundance can help constrain the effective number of neutrino species and hence place restrictions on the presence of any `` dark radiation '' component ( e.g.  sterile  neutrinos , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it also put constraints on any possible lepton asymmetry ( an excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos , or vice versa ) that may exist @xcite .    to detect small deviations from sbbn and constrain cosmological parameters , the primordial he abundance @xmath7 has to be determined to a level of accuracy of better than one percent .",
    "the primordial abundance of he can in principle be derived accurately from observations of the helium and hydrogen emission lines from low - metallicity blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , which have undergone little chemical evolution .    to attain the above accuracy",
    ", many conditions have to be met .",
    "in particular , the observational data should be of good quality and the observational sample should be large to reduce statistical uncertainties .",
    "the primary concern of our group over the last two decades has been to gather such good data for large galaxy samples . @xcite and @xcite have obtained high signal - to - noise spectra of a total of 86 low - metallicity extragalactic h  ii regions in 77 galaxies @xcite , constituting the hebcd sample .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite have used archival data to collect a sample of 75 very large telescope ( vlt ) spectra of low - metallicity h  ii regions .",
    "finally , 1442 high - quality spectra of low - metallicity h  ii regions have been extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) @xcite .",
    "these were chosen to have the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 emission line measured with an accuracy better than 25% , and to have all strongest he  i emission lines in the optical range , @xmath03889 , @xmath04471 , @xmath05876 , @xmath06678 , and @xmath07065 , measured with good accuracy . because of the large sizes of these samples , it is now generally agreed that the accuracy of the determination of the primordial he abundance is limited at present more by systematic uncertainties and biases than by statistical errors .",
    "there are many known effects that need to be corrected for to transform the observed he  i line intensities into a he abundance . neglecting or misestimating them may lead to systematic errors in the @xmath7 determination that can be larger than the statistical errors .",
    "different empirical methods have been used to derive the he primordial abundance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of them make use of analytical fits for various physical processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including fits of he  i and h  i emissivities and of effects that make the observed line intensities deviate from their recombination values .",
    "these effects include for instance collisional and fluorescent enhancements of he  i recombination lines and underlying he  i stellar absorption lines . a detailed discussion of the role of each of these various effects is given in @xcite .",
    "most of the known systematic effects have generally been taken into account in the most recent work on the determination of the helium abundance(e.g . * ? ? ?",

    "subsequent to this work , a new set of he  i line emissivities was put forward by @xcite . with this new emissitivity set , @xcite derived @xmath7 = 0.254  @xmath8  0.003 ( 1@xmath25 ) based on a large sample , while @xcite obtained @xmath7 = 0.2465  @xmath8  0.0097 with the same restricted sample .",

    "our near - infrared spectroscopic data come from three sources .",
    "the majority of the near - infrared spectra of our sample galaxies were obtained with the 3.5 m apache point observatory ( apo ) telescope , in conjunction with the triplespec spectrograph , on a number of nights during the 2008  2013 period .",
    "triplespec @xcite is a cross - dispersed nir spectrograph that provides simultaneous continuous wavelength coverage from 0.90 to 2.46 @xmath37 m in five spectral orders during a single exposure .",
    "a 11@xmath943  slit was used , resulting in a resolving power of 3500 . during the course of each night ,",

    "finally , we have retrieved from the european south observatory ( eso ) data archives vlt / isaac nir spectra for two objects and ntt / sofi nir spectra for another two objects .",
    "in addition , all galaxies listed in table [ tab1 ] possess good optical spectra either obtained by our group in the past for the determination of the primordial helium abundance , or from the sdss spectral data base .",
    "the optical data is described in @xcite and in other references given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the complementary optical data are necessary to derive physical conditions and abundances in the sample galaxies .",
    "we have carried out the reduction of the data according to the following procedures .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were first cleaned for cosmic ray hits using the iraf routine crmedian .",
    "then all a and b frames were separately co - added and the resulting b frame was subtracted from the resulting a frame .",
    "finally , the ( negative ) spectrum at position b was adjusted to the ( positive ) spectrum at position a and subtracted from it .",
    "the same reduction scheme was applied to the standard stars .",
    "we then use the iraf routines identify , reidentify , fitcoord , and transform to perform wavelength calibration and correction for distortion and tilt for each frame . for all galaxies ,",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum was extracted from the two - dimensional frames using the apall iraf routine .",
    "flux calibration and correction for telluric absorption were performed by first multiplying the one - dimensional spectrum of each galaxy by the synthetic absolute spectral distribution of the standard star , smoothed to the same spectral resolution , and then by dividing the result by the observed one - dimensional spectrum of the same star . since there does not exist published absolute spectral energy distributions of the standard stars that were used , we have simply scaled the synthetic absolute sed of the star vega ( @xmath23 lyrae ) , also of a0v spectral type , to the brightness of the standard star .    the emission - line fluxes were measured using gaussian fitting with the iraf splot routine .",
    "the line flux errors were estimated by monte carlo simulations in splot , setting the number of trials to 200 .",
    "two representative spectra , one of a high - density h  ii region ( left ) and the other of a low - density one ( right ) are shown in fig .",
    "the fluxes and equivalent widths of the he  i @xmath010830  emission line , needed for the @xmath7 determination , and of the p@xmath40 @xmath010940  emission line , needed to adjust nir and optical spectra , are presented in table [ tab2 ] .",

    "the references to these studies are shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we have listed the main physical parameters along with their uncertainties in table [ tab3 ] .",

    "they were propagated to derive the oxygen and helium abundances .",
    "whenever there exists several observations of the same object in the optical range , we treat those as independent observations to increase the statistics .",

    "to carry out our empirical method to determine helium abundances in real h  ii regions , several effects need to be considered and corrections applied .    first , the balmer decrement corrected for the non - recombination contribution was used to simultaneously determine the dust extinction and equivalent widths of underlying stellar hydrogen absorption lines , as described e.g. in @xcite , and to correct line intensities for both effects .",

    "we present for the first time spectroscopic observations in the near - infrared ( nir ) range of the high - intensity density - sensitive he  i @xmath010830  emission line for a large sample of 45 low - metallicity high - excitation h  ii regions in star - forming dwarf galaxies . using this nir line flux in combination with existing spectroscopic data in the optical range of the same h  ii regions , we have obtained a new determination of the primordial he abundance . at the same time , we have also shown the importance of the he  i nir line for improving the accuracy of he abundance determinations .",
    "our main results are summarised below .",
    "we demonstrate that the use of the he  i @xmath010830emission line greatly improves the determination of the physical conditions in the h  ii regions because of the strong dependence of its flux on the electron number density .",
    "we find that the linear regressions @xmath2  o / h used for determination of the primordial he mass fraction @xmath7 are much tighter than those studied previously if the nir he  i @xmath010830  emission line is included , rather than relying only on the optical he  i lines .",
    "3 . using the linear regression @xmath2  o / h for a sample of 28 highest - excitation h  ii regions , we have derived a primordial he mass fraction @xmath7 = 0.2551 @xmath8 0.0022 .",
    "this is higher than the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) value of 0.2477 @xmath8 0.0001 inferred from the temperature fluctuations of the microwave background radiation .",
    "this difference possibly indicates deviations from the standard rate of hubble expansion in the early universe , and hence the possible presence of dark radiation .",
    "4 . using our derived he primordial abundance together with the most recently derived primordial abundance of d , and the @xmath11 technique , we found that the best agreement between the abundances of these light elements is achieved in the bbn model with a baryon mass fraction @xmath12 = 0.0240@xmath80.0034 ( 99% cl ) and an effective number of neutrino species @xmath13 = 3.58@xmath80.50 ( 99% cl ) .",
    "both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values agree with those inferred from the temperature fluctuations of the microwave background radiation .",
    "a non - standard value of @xmath13 is preferred at the 99% cl , implying the possible existence of additional types of neutrino species .",
