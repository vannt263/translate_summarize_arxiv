    "there is a strong correlation between the total luminosities of galaxies and the global rotation velocities ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "the correlation can be applied to give distances to galaxies .",
    "the rotation parameter gives an expectation luminosity and the apparent luminosity falls off from this value as the square of the distance .",
    "aaronson , huchra , & mould ( 1979 ) noted the advantages of _ infrared _ luminosities : obscuration is minimized and the light comes from old stars which have less stochastic variability than the young stars .",
    "there is a substantial correlation between color and luminosity for spirals so the detailed correlations between luminosity and the rotation rate parameter depend on wavelength ( tully , mould , & aaronson 1982 ) , steepening toward the infrared .",
    "the original demonstration of the correlation used photographic or @xmath2 band data while the aaronson et al .",
    "collaboration pioneered work at aperture @xmath3 band ( @xmath4 m ) . in recent years",
    ", there has been a great deal of work at intermediate bands ; either in the red where the contrast against the sky background is optimal ( pierce & tully 1988 , 1992 ; willick 1991 ; courteau 1996 ) or at @xmath5 band where obscuration effects are the most diminished within the spectral domain accessible to ccd cameras ( pierce & tully 1988 , 1992 ; han 1992 ; mathewson , ford , & buchhorn 1992 ; giovanelli et al 1997 ) .    since the seminal aperture photometry work by aaronson et al .",
    ", there has been only limited work at longer wavelengths ( eg , peletier & willner 1991 , 1993 ) although electronic imagers have become available with reasonably large formats .",
    "the primary disadvantage at wavelengths greater than 1  micron is the strong and variable atmospheric emission .",
    "all but the very centers of the highest surface brightness galaxies emit below the flux levels of the sky .",
    "our experience is at , ( @xmath0 m ) a shift of the @xmath6 band to avoid thermal emission ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) .",
    "one observes several scalelengths farther out in a galaxy at @xmath7 or @xmath5 than at  with a fixed integration at the same telescope focus ( tully et al .",
    "on the other hand , there is the considerable advantage that obscuration problems are almost eliminated by  ( 25% of the @xmath5 extinction according to tully et al .",
    "if extinction can be largely negated then one can restrict to samples that are highly inclined which minimizes the corrections required for projection effects in the kinematic parameter .",
    "arguably the most dangerous potential systematic effects arise out of uncertain inclination and extinction corrections . hence , although the correlations at  are no better than at @xmath5 and are a lot more work to acquire , they do eliminate some systematic problems .",
    "the first order of business is to see if one gets the same results across the spectrum from blue to infrared bands .",
    "our strategy parallels the optical band procedures described by tully & pierce ( 1999 ; hereafter tp ) .",
    "template luminosity  hi profile linewidth correlations are produced for magnitude - limited cluster samples . in the present case , data are available for two clusters .",
    "we vary the assumed differential distance modulus between clusters until an rms minimization is achieved with a linear regression slope to the common data set .",
    "the regression takes errors to be in linewidths , the prescription described by tp to avoid the malmquist ( 1920 ) bias caused by a magnitude limit .",
    "the absolute scale of the correlation is set by least squares fit of the template relation to the luminosity  linewidth properties of a small number of galaxies with accurate independent distances .",
    "the ursa major cluster is as close to home as the virgo or fornax clusters but it is much more irregular , with no defined center , and a dynamical collapse time not much less than the age of the universe .",
    "the 79 known members are predominantly hi - rich disk systems , similar to those found in low density environments . the sample was discussed by tully et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the data used in the current paper are presented in that earlier publication .",
    "there are 38 galaxies with @xmath8 ( after corrections ) , inclination @xmath9 and type s@xmath10 or later .",
    "the same sample is used to study optical band luminosity  linewidth correlations by tp and we use the same hi profile and inclination information .",
    "the small corrections for extinction as a function of galaxy inclination are those described by tully et al .",
    "the tiny corrections for galactic extinction are derived from the selected reddening given by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) ; we take @xmath11 .",
    "the relevant data are gathered together in table  1 .",
    "the sample to be considered is a spatially restricted subset of the material discussed by tp .",
    "the perseus - pisces filament is a prominent structure at roughly 5,000  that includes several abell and other clusters .",
    "the study of optical correlations by tp drew galaxies from a @xmath12 length of the filament . here",
    "we consider 27 galaxies drawn from the restricted range @xmath13 .",
    "there are several sub - condensations of galaxies in this so - called pisces cluster but the structure is irregular and probably dynamically young overall .",
    "sakai , giovanelli , & wegner ( 1994 ) identify separate ngc  383 and ngc  507 groups within this region .",
    "tp failed to find any differential in distances between separate components .",
    "the  photometry to be used is published here for the first time although it was involved in the analysis by tully et al .",
    "the observations were made on 10 november , 1995 , with the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea .",
    "a 1024x1024 hgcdte detector provided a field of 193 arcsec with 0.19 arcsec pixels .",
    "five dithered 60 sec exposures were combined .",
    "the observing sequence would run sky - object 1 - object 2 - sky - object3 - object4 - sky ... hence object observations were always either immediately preceded or followed by sky observations so there could be proper subtraction of the sky background .",
    "pixel to pixel variations are eliminated using a combination of dome and sky flats .",
    "dithered images were registered and median filtered to eliminate defects .",
    "reductions were carried out with iraf routines .",
    "once contaminating sources were masked , elliptical isophotes were fit progressively with radius , exponential disks were fit , and fluxes were extrapolated to infinity to give total magnitudes .",
    "the small reddening corrections follow the same prescriptions mentioned in the previous sub - section .",
    "the hi profile information and inclinations are again the same as those used in the optical study of tp .",
    "the relevant material is presented in table  1 .      a special set - up provides a very wide field for  observations .",
    "the university of hawaii 0.61 m telescope is used to piggyback an 0.25 m telescope that feeds the 1024x1024 hgcdte detector .",
    "the set - up gives a 29 arcmin field with 1.69 arcsec pixels .",
    "this field of view is greater than the dimensions of all galaxies in the northern sky with the exceptions of m31 and m33 .",
    "observations of many of the largest galaxies were undertaken 6 - 11 february , 1997 . among",
    "the galaxies successfully observed , there are four that have accurate independent distances .",
    "cepheid variables have been observed in ngc  3031 ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 : @xmath14 ) , ngc  3198 ( kelson et al .",
    "1999 : @xmath15 ) , ngc  3627 ( saha et al .",
    "1999 ; gibson et al . 1999 : @xmath16 ) , and ngc  4258 ( maoz et al . 1999 : @xmath17 ) .",
    "hi line profile information is available for each of these galaxies .",
    "the 4 galaxies are among the expanded set of calibrators used in the tp optical band study .",
    "the observing strategy with the small telescope is similar to that used with the 2.2 m telescope except the exposures extend over an hour per object so more frequent excursions are needed between object and sky .",
    "we observe in the pattern object - sky north - object - sky south - object - sky east - object - sky west ( 5 object , 4 sky ) .",
    "exposures were 120 seconds and the pattern was repeated twice per object , resulting in a cumulative on - target exposure of 20 minutes .",
    "reduction procedures are similar between the observations taken with the large and small telescopes except for a caveat about flat fielding .",
    "dome flats are not possible with the 0.25 m telescope because the dome is not sufficiently out of focus .",
    "the observations with the small telescope were obtained remotely and we were not successful with twilight flats during the run in question . hence flats were exclusively generated by median filtering all the off - object frames .",
    "adjustments for inclination and extinction within our galaxy follow the same recipes previously mentioned . again , inclination and hi linewidth information is taken from tp .",
    "this material is gathered in table  1 .",
    "the data is accumulated in table  1 and provides information comparable to that in a table in tp .",

    "in the two panels of figure  1 , one sees apparent magnitudes plotted against a logarithmic linewidth parameter for the two separate clusters .",
    "the linewidth parameter is derived from the 21  cm hi profile width and approximates @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rotation curve maximum velocity ( tully & fouqu 1985 ) . within type and inclination limits , the ursa major sample is complete to @xmath31 and the pisces sample is almost complete to @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 magnitudes are extrapolated to infinity and the superscripts indicate corrections have been made for galactic and internal extinction and the redshift effect ) .",
    "in figure  2 , the pisces sample has been shifted @xmath34 to achieve a best fit with the ursa major data .",
    "the fitting procedure is described in tp .",
    "here is a brief review .",
    "least squares fits are made with errors taken in linewidths , the procedure that nulls the malmquist bias that arises with magnitude - limited samples .",
    "( naive application of the regression with errors in magnitude to give distances would result in biased distances @xmath35 low . )",
    "a fit is made to the ursa major data alone , and the slope is force fit to the pisces data to obtain a preliminary offset .",
    "once this offset is applied , a fit is made to the combined data sets , then the new fit is applied separately to the two clusters to determine a residual difference .",
    "the pisces offset is corrected by the residual , the process is repeated , and convergence is rapidly achieved .",
    "the best fit is illustrated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "the rms scatter of the 65 points is @xmath36 .",
    "accurate distances are known for 4 galaxies with  apparent magnitude and hi linewidth information : ngc  3031 , ngc  3198 , ngc  3627 , and ngc  4258 . the intrinsic luminosity ",
    "linewidth relation for the four systems is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the dashed line has the slope derived from the ursa major + pisces template and a zero - point that minimizes the sum of the deviations squared .",
    "this line is described by the formula : @xmath37 the @xmath38 error on the slope is derived from the 2 cluster fit . the error on the zero - point",
    "is derived from the constraint from the 4 galaxies with cepheid distances .",
    "the rms scatter of the four points is @xmath39 .",
    "the fit of the template data to the absolute calibration is seen in figure  4 .",
    "this fit requires a distance modulus for the ursa major cluster of 31.31 and a modulus for pisces of 33.86 .",
    "ten additional galaxies were observed at  with the 0.25 m aperture wide field arrangement .",
    "the absolute calibration of the luminosity  linewidth correlation given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be used to establish the distances of these galaxies .",
    "information about these systems is provided in table  2 .",
    "the format of this table resembles that of table  1 with small differences .",
    "the systemic velocities are the @xmath40 values of the third reference catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) rather than velocities in the frame of the microwave background and the absolute magnitudes are calculated from eq .",
    "there are two additional hi profile references : 613 @xmath28 cayatte et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and 638 @xmath28 rupen ( 1991 ) .    from the scatter in the luminosity ",
    "linewidth plots , the rms uncertainty for an individual modulus is judged to be @xmath41 .",
    "the corrected linewidth for ngc  2841 is larger than the value for any of the calibrator or template systems .",
    "hence application to this galaxy involves an extrapolation of the luminosity  linewidth correlation .",
    "the constraints on the hubble constant provided by tp are more restrictive but this first determination with the  correlation is worth noting .",
    "the ursa major cluster is strongly disturbed from hubble expansion by its proximity to the virgo cluster but the pisces cluster is distant enough that its velocity may predominantly reflect the hubble flow .",
    "the velocity of this cluster in the microwave background frame is 4771  ( han & mould 1992 ) and the distance from the  calibration is 59  mpc , whence h@xmath42  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the statistical errors in this determination of h@xmath43 are dominated by the small number of zero - point calibrators .",
    "a reduced @xmath44 goodness of fit is presented in figure  5 .",
    "the 95% probability limits on the hubble constant _ from this uncertainty alone _ are @xmath45 .",
    "there is limited value in exploring all the potential uncertainties in the current analysis because the same issues are addressed in tp , but in that paper we use many more template galaxies , more calibrators , and more clusters extending to larger velocities .",
    "the present  sample is a subset of the optical sample and we use the same hi profile and inclination information .",
    "with so many factors held the same , we are able to see if there are any significant systematics due only to the photometry . in particular , the  version has little sensitivity to extinction .",
    "the scale difference is a remarkably small @xmath46 , a 1% distance effect ( the @xmath38 uncertainty with the use of only 4 calibrators is 5% ) .",
    "the analysis at @xmath47 bands by tp gives h@xmath48 with essentially the entire difference a result of extending the analysis to include twelve clusters .",
