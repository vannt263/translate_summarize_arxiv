    "b physics experiments provide a good test of the standard model and severe constraints of new physics parameters .",
    "recent years more and more efforts have been made to the study of b meson decays both experimentally and theoretically . in the near future , there will be more and more data in @xmath12 physics thanks to the run of b factories , tevatron and lhcb .",
    "theoretically , a great improvement has been made to the study of exclusive decays of b mesons . in the history ,",
    "naive factorization @xcite is a successful method to explain many decay branching ratios @xcite , but it failed to explain color - suppressed processes such as @xmath13 @xcite . currently , perturbative qcd factorization approach ( pqcd ) @xcite is one of the popular methods to deal with the two - body non - leptonic decays of b mesons .",
    "it explains the experiments successfully , especially for the direct cp asymmetries @xcite when the final states are two light mesons , which inspires people to see how far it will go .",
    "charmed decays of @xmath12 ( @xmath9 ) mesons are more complicated than the decays with only light mesons as final states .",
    "the @xmath14 transitions involve three scales : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the factorization was proved in soft - collinear effective theory @xcite with less predictions than pqcd approach , since they need more inputs than pqcd approach . in @xmath18 light transition ,",
    "the light spectator quark in @xmath12 meson is soft , while it is collinear in the final state meson , so that a hard gluon is needed to connect it to the four quark operator shown in figure  1 .",
    "the momentum square of the hard gluon connecting the spectator quark in @xmath14 transition is only a factor of @xmath19 than the @xmath18 light transition , which shows pqcd should also work well in @xmath14 transitions .",
    "the hierarchy : @xmath20 is used in pqcd framework @xcite .",
    "some separate calculations on @xmath14 decays in pqcd approach are carried on  @xcite in the leading order of @xmath21 and @xmath22 expansions .",
    "it s found that the pqcd do work well since the @xmath6 meson recoils fast .",
    "decays ]    in this paper , we calculate all the processes of a @xmath23 meson decays to a @xmath24 meson and a light pseudoscalar meson or vector meson .",
    "only tree diagrams contribute to these processes involving only one kind of ckm matrix elements .",
    "so there s no direct cp asymmetry in these decays .",
    "the light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcda ) of mesons are necessary inputs in the pqcd framework .",
    "the light mesons distribution amplitudes ( das ) have been well studied and calculated by qcd sum rules .",
    "but there are little studies on heavy mesons das , especially for d meson . in this paper",
    "we collect several candidate distribution amplitude models for d meson , then we fit out the parameters using the experimental results and make a comparison among them .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ section : analytic_formulae ] contains the conventions and notations that we adopt , together with all the wave functions used in this paper .",

    "we should mention that , these results are just indicative , because transverse polarizations are power suppressed by @xmath90 or @xmath91 to make it more sensitive to small parameters and higher order contributions than the longitudinal contribution .",
    "although the transverse polarization is suppressed in @xmath92 decays , in some channels , such as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , etc , it has 40% contributions .",
    "the reason is that the dominant contribution in these channels is from @xmath95 in eq.([md ] ) , which is @xmath52 suppressed , while the transverse contribution in eq.([mint ] ) is only @xmath91 suppressed .",
    "they are comparable numerically to make a large contribution for transverse polarizations in these color suppressed channels .",
    "this mechanism is different from those charmless @xmath12 decays where the dominant transverse polarizations are from the space like penguin ( penguin annihilation ) contributions @xcite . here",
    "the annihilation type contributions are mainly from w exchange diagrams contributing little to transverse polarizations .    for those previous calculated channels in pqcd approach @xcite ,",
    "our results are slightly different due to parameter changes .",

    "our predictions will soon be tested by the lhcb experiments .",
    "for comparison with other methods , we also give the form factors at the maximal recoil @xmath97 these are comparable with other methods @xcite .    if applying the naive factorization approach , we can get @xmath98 substituting our results for @xmath99 and @xmath100 in eq.([a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , we can extract the bsw parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 from our pqcd approach @xmath103 if the annihilation diagrams contribution is excluded , the results are @xmath104 indeed , the large @xmath105 implies that the color suppressed decays not very suppressed as previous expected @xcite .",
    "the relative strong phase between the two contributions is not small as naive expectations .",
    "these results are consistent with recent direct studies from experiments @xcite . but",
    "the difference is that our results come from direct dynamical calculation not from fit .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the branch ratios of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels , with the d meson wave function obtained through fitting .",
    "we also calculate the ratios of transverse polarized contributions in @xmath92 decays .",
    "most of the results agree well with the experiments .",
    "it seems that there s a disagreement with the experimental data in the relative size of branching ratios for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "some channels of the @xmath92 decays may receive large contribution from the transverse polarization .",
    "the results of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 decays will be tested in the future experiments .",
