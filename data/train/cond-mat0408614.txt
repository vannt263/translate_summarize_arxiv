    "i address the question , what is the appropriate stochastic equation of motion to use when modelling a driven steady state ( including chaotic and fluctuating steady states ) such as that of a fluid under continuous shear flow ? at equilibrium , the solution is well understood . to generate configurations consistent with the equilibrium ensemble",
    ", one may use any equation of motion that respects the principle of detailed balance , which is a constraint on ratios of forward and reverse transition rates .",
    "that condition ensures that every thermally - driven flux is balanced by an equal and opposite flux . for non - equilibrium systems in",
    "continuously driven steady states , no such guidance is hitherto available in choosing an equation of motion consistent with the _ mechanically _ ( externally ) driven fluxes , so arbitrary choices are often made .",
    "the aim of this work is to eliminate arbitrariness , and determine what transition rates are implied by the macroscopic state of the non - equilibrium system , i.e. its mean energy and flux , combined with our knowledge of the microscopic laws of physics .",
    "the objective is to use _ only _ the information that is available , without unwittingly introducing any arbitrariness , deriving from personal prejudices .",
    "the method for keeping the amount of information constant throughout the calculation is jaynes information - theoretic method of maximum entropy inference @xcite(maxent ) , which is often misunderstood in the context of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , despite recent notable achievements @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully used to derive fluctuation theorems @xcite and linear transport theory @xcite , and to explain self - organised criticality @xcite .",
    "jaynes gives a nice explanation of maximum entropy inference in his original paper on the subject @xcite , where he uses the method to re - derive equilibrium statistical mechanics without the need for many microscopic details that had previously been considered necessary .",
    "the application of the method to equilibrium systems is uncontroversial .",
    "however , the history of non - equilibrium information theory can be confusing because it has been used in so many different ways , some of them exact , some only approximate .",
    "in fact , information theory itself is not a physical theory , but a mathematical method , providing a logical structure .",
    "some physical input is required if such a method is to make physical predictions .",
    "if one throws away too much relevant information about some non - equilibrium system before applying maxent , it will still provide answers , but they will be inaccurate .",
    "for instance , using the method to minimise the information content of the momentum distribution in a non - equilibrium gas , although efficacious , is not an exact method , as was recently shown @xcite . in fact , there is no justification for discarding all information content except for some averaged features .",
    "indeed , particles possess their individual velocities for a reason : they have each come from somewhere , and are going somewhere , and their journeys will affect the trajectories of other particles .",
    "these facts are relevant to the physics of a non - equilibrium system , and lead to temporal correlations .    at the other extreme ,",
    "if one retains all the details of a system s phase - space trajectory , allowing no stochastic input ( e.g.  from a reservoir ) , then maxent becomes a null procedure , since it is asked to choose the most likely distribution from a choice of only one physical scenario - a delta function distribution of trajectories .",
    "such a null procedure may be regarded as an extreme case where maxent can correctly  predict \" any and all physics .",
    "there is thus no reason in principle why maxent should be expected to fail in non - equilibrium situations , if we ask it the right questions .",
    "the choice of the prior set of options that is presented to maxent is of crucial importance .",
    "it should be a set of physical paths through phase space , that each obeys newton s laws , so that all physics ( the navier - stokes equation , long - range correlations , etc . )",
    "is respected _ a priori_. maxent then tells us which of these trajectories is most likely to be chosen , under the influence of a non - equilibrium reservoir that is coupled to the system but uncorrelated with it .",
    "this is the application of information theory that should be understood here and in refs .",
    "i derive its implications for transition rates .    alternatively , as is often done in theoretical modelling",
    ", one can settle for a physically imprecise prior set of dynamical rules  such as brownian particles , or a discrete state space , or discrete time steps  so that things become easy to solve . then applying the methods below will , accordingly , yield only approximate physics , but at least one will know exactly what information went into the simplified model .",
    "such an application of the present theory would yield transition rates that are somewhat arbitrary , due to the arbitrariness of the prior rates that are chosen . however",
    ", it will provide strictly _ the least _ arbitrary model .",
    "such a model will be derived in section [ applications ] for a stochastically hopping particle , that demonstrates some features of the method .",
    "it is important to realise that the approximations introduced in that section are only for expediency in that particular model .",
    "the general derivation of the method for obtaining transition rates from prior dynamical rules combined with non - equilibrium macroscopic observables , presented in sections [ presentation ] and [ variants ] , remains exact .",
    "the conditions derived here for macroscopically driven steady states are analogous to the equilibrium principle of detailed balance . like detailed balance ,",
    "the conditions are not sufficient to completely determine the microscopic transition rates , but are necessary to be satisfied by any equation of motion that generates an unbiased ergodic driven steady - state ensemble .",
    "the derivation of detailed balance relies on two assumptions : time - reversal symmetry of the microscopic laws of motion , and the ergodic hypothesis which implies that a heat reservoir can be characterised by the boltzmann distribution with temperature as the only parameter .",
    "similarly , the non - equilibrium conditions assume the same microscopic laws that govern equilibrium motions ( therefore implicitly requiring microscopic time - reversal symmetry , broken only by imposition of the macroscopic flux ) , and rely also on a hypothesis of ergodicity implying that the driven reservoir is fully characterised by its macroscopic observables ( mean energy and flux ) . many quiescent systems ( those without fluxes )",
    "are at thermodynamic equilibrium , but exceptions include glasses @xcite , granular media @xcite , and certain cellular automata @xcite , in which the ergodic hypothesis and/or microscopic reversibility fails . boltzmann s law and the principle of detailed balance apply only to that class of quiescent systems that are , by definition , at equilibrium . that class of systems has of course proved to be large , significant and interesting .",
    "similarly , not every non - equilibrium steady state should be expected to respect the conditions presented here ; exceptions include traffic flow and fluids of molecular motors , in which the constituents violate time reversal symmetry .",
    "the ergodic hypothesis may also fail in some systems , implying that hidden information that is not apparent in the macroscopic observables is nonetheless significant . however , it is anticipated that the ergodicity criteria are respected by the transition rates of many macroscopically driven systems , defining a special and important class .",
    "the method outlined in section [ presentation ] was presented in a recent letter @xcite .",
    "it is explained here in more detail , and the analysis extended to an alternative non - equilibrium ensemble in section [ variants ] .",
    "the method is demonstrated in section [ model ] where rates are derived for the stochastic transitions of a particle hopping in a non - trivial energy landscape , subject to a driving force .",
    "applications to other models are also discussed in section [ applications ] .",
    "using jaynes interpretation of gibbs entropy @xcite , it is possible to make a  maximum entropy inference \" @xcite to assess the probability that a system , subject to random influences , ( whether at equilibrium or not ) takes a particular trajectory @xmath0 through its phase space , thus allowing us to assess the _",

    "the recipe for the probability @xmath1 of trajectory @xmath0 is to maximize the shannon entropy , or information entropy , @xmath2 subject to constraints that some averaged properties of the trajectories conform with our knowledge of the macroscopic features such as mean energy , volume , flux etc .    in principle",
    ", this formalism gives us a full solution of the statistics of any ensemble , be it at equilibrium or not . in the absence of any macroscopic fluxes ( i.e.  at equilibrium )",
    ", the prescription reduces to a maximization of the gibbs entropy with respect to a distribution of instantaneous states rather than trajectories , yielding boltzmann s law . in the non - equilibrium case",

    "it would be more useful to have a formula for the probability of a short segment of the trajectory , a single transition from a state @xmath3 to a subsequent state @xmath4 .",
    "such a transition probability is what we require for designing a stochastic model or simulation .",
    "this would allow us to generate trajectories belonging to the non - equilibrium ensemble .",
    "let us now derive that formula .",
    "we begin with some trivial calculations to establish notation .      at any instant @xmath5",
    ", the entire state of a system is represented classically by its phase - space position vector @xmath6 .",
    "this is a high - dimensional vector specifying the positions and momenta of all the particles constituting the system .",
    "as time progresses from the beginning @xmath7 to the end @xmath8 of the experiment or simulation , @xmath6 traces out a trajectory @xmath0 through phase space .",
    "it will prove useful to label each probability distribution function with a subscript indicating the duration of the trajectories to which it applies thus : @xmath9 .",
    "for a deterministic system with definite initial conditions , only one trajectory is possible , so the probability distribution is a delta function . in the presence of randomness , such as coupling to a reservoir of systems with similar properties ,",
    "the distribution is finite for all trajectories that respect some prior dynamical rules , such as conservation of momentum for all internal degrees of freedom not directly coupled to the reservoir .    in the _ absence _ of any posterior constraints other than normalization ,",
    "@xmath10 all trajectories of a given duration @xmath11 have equal _ a priori _ probability .",
    "that is not an independent postulate , but is embodied in the maximum entropy principle of information theory @xcite , since the entropy - maximizing distribution is given by @xmath12 with a lagrange multiplier @xmath13 chosen for consistency with eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ prior ] ) is solved by @xmath14 , indicating that the unconstrained ( ` prior ' ) set of trajectories of a given duration have equal probability .",
    "we now impose a posterior constraint , and calculate the statistical properties of that sub - set of trajectories that respect the constraint .",
    "let us not necessarily conserve the energy @xmath15 of the system at each instant ( since we allow energy exchange with a reservoir ) , but rather demand that its time - average over the whole trajectory @xmath0 is fixed at @xmath16 .",
    "we shall use a bar to indicate time averages , so that @xmath17    let us divide the trajectory @xmath0 into shorter segments @xmath18 , each of duration @xmath19 .",
    "then the constraint on the time - averaged energy may be written @xmath20 assuming ergodicity , time - averages are equivalent to ensemble - averages in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "so this constraint , for a time - average on @xmath0 , defines the equilibrium canonical ensemble for @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , the conditional probability of encountering a particular trajectory segment @xmath18 of duration @xmath19 , given that the whole trajectory has a time - averaged energy @xmath16 , is found by maximizing the information entropy for @xmath18 subject to eq .",
    "( [ canonical ] ) .",

    "a transition rate , for any transition between states @xmath27 say , can be written as a conditional probability . if we consider a trajectory segment @xmath28 of duration @xmath29 , representing the transition @xmath27 , then the transition rate at some time , which we may define without loss of generality to be @xmath7 , is @xmath30 this is the probability ( per unit time ) of encountering the trajectory , _ given _ that we begin at @xmath3 .",
    "equation  ( [ priorrate ] ) gives the _ prior _ rate of the particular transition .",

    "we have looked so far at the prior phase - space trajectories , and those for systems in the equilibrium ensemble . our goal is to determine the transition rates appropriate to a non - equilibrium ensemble , for which there is an imposed flux @xmath33 .",

    "let us allow the flux to fluctuate , and demand only that the dynamics will result in some finite value @xmath34 of the flux time - averaged over the whole trajectory : @xmath35 we ask , what is the probability , in time @xmath29 , of encountering the transition @xmath36 , given that we begin in state @xmath3 , and that the dynamics will eventually conspire to produce a mean flux @xmath34 and energy @xmath16 ?",

    "let us say that this axis represents integrated flux , i.e. the flux that the system has accrued since @xmath7 .",
    "we must imagine that all the other coordinates required to fully describe the state of the system , are on axes perpendicular to the page .",
    "a sample of trajectories representing the equilibrium distribution is shown ( in grey and black ) .",
    "these trajectories are concentrated close to the time axis ( zero flux ) . if another axis measuring instantaneous energy @xmath38 were constructed perpendicular to the page , then the density of trajectories would be exponentially distributed along that axis , by boltzmann s law .",

    "[ trajectories ] ( the single transition @xmath27 ) of microscopic duration @xmath29 , given that we are currently ( at @xmath7 ) in state @xmath3 , and that the whole trajectory belongs to this equilibrium set .",
    "equation ( [ drivenrate ] ) asks for the frequency with which that trajectory segment @xmath39 occurs in the sub - set of trajectories shown in black in fig .",
    "[ trajectories ] , for which a given integrated flux will be accumulated by time @xmath8 .",
    "this sub - set of trajectories is the driven ensemble .",
    "note that we shall not require @xmath29 to vanish .",
    "the discussion will cover discrete - time processes for which the microscopic time step is @xmath40 , as well as continuous - time dynamics for which @xmath41 .      to mathematically manipulate conditional probabilities , we appeal to bayes theorem .",
    "it states that the joint probability of two outcomes @xmath42 and @xmath43 both occurring , given a third fact @xmath44 , may be written in two equivalent ways : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is simply used to mean ` probability ' for any event ( appropriately normalised ) , as opposed to a particular distribution function .",
    "we can now assign the following meanings : @xmath42 is the fact that the transition @xmath27 takes place within @xmath29 , represented by the trajectory @xmath28 ; @xmath43 says that the flux has a mean value @xmath47 averaged over the entire duration @xmath11 ; and @xmath44 is the combined statement that the initial state at @xmath7 is @xmath3 and that the trajectory s time - averaged energy will be @xmath25 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ bayes ] ) expresses the probability of the transition taking place within @xmath29 _ and _ the flux averaged over @xmath11 being @xmath34 , for the given initial state and average energy .",
    "it is re - written thus : @xmath48 notice that it is redundant to specify the two conditions @xmath49 , since the trajectory segment @xmath28 is the transition @xmath27 which includes the initial state @xmath3 . substituting from eqs .",
    "( [ eqrate ] ) and ( [ drivenrate ] ) yields a theorem for transition rates in the driven steady - state ensemble , @xmath50 notice that all quantities on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) are defined _ at equilibrium _",
    ", not on the driven ensemble .",
    "this is indicated by the superscript ` eq ' , which is equivalent to the condition fixing @xmath51 , the time - averaged energy .",
    "equation  ( [ relation ] ) tells us that the transition rate in the driven ensemble is given by the transition rate in the equilibrium ensemble , multiplied by an enhancement or attenuation factor .",
    "we shall see below that the theorem makes intuitive sense .",
    "given that the dynamics must be consistent with the macroscopically observable mean energy and flux , and with the same microscopic laws of motion that hold sway in an equilibrium system , maxent yields an unbiased description ofthe dynamics , and thereby constrains the system the least .",
    "equation([relation ] ) specifies explicitly the dynamical rules implied bymaxent .",
    "how do we know that eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) constrains the dynamics the least ? it does , because all the quantities on the rhs are defined for the maximum - entropy ensemble at equilibrium , i.e.  without the extra constraint on the flux .",
    "given that we start with an unbiased set ( the equilibrium ensemble ) , bayes theorem gives us the least biased set subject to the extra posterior constraint .",
    "let us examine the enhancement factor in eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) in detail .",
    "it is a ratio of conditional probabilities for encountering a flux @xmath34 in the equilibrium ensemble . of course",
    ", we do not expect a system at equilibrium to exhibit any net flux , averaged over its whole trajectory .",
    "the chance of such a flux arising spontaneously at equilibrium is vanishingly small ( as @xmath52 ) .",
    "so the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) is the ratio of two vanishingly small terms",
    ". however unlikely it may be for an equilibrium system to spontaneously exhibit the desired macroscopic flux , we ask , how much would that probability be enhanced as a result of the putative transition @xmath27 ?",
    "if the dynamics of the transition itself contributes some flux to the trajectory , it is favoured by the enhancement factor .",
    "the factor also favours transitions to configurations that give a greater than average probability of subsequently obtaining the desired flux , for the given starting point .",
    "if the new state @xmath4 is more likely to initiate high - flux trajectories , then the transition rate is boosted over and above the equilibrium rate .",
    "we shall examine the implications of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) in some examples , but firstly let us interpret the meaning of its derivation .",
    "imagine that a lazy physicist wishes to collect data from a driven steady state , such as continuous shear flow of a complex fluid .",
    "our physicist has a computer program that simulates the fluid at equilibrium ( with free or frictionless boundaries , say ) , and is too lazy to write a new program that simulates shear .",
    "instead , ( s)he runs the equilibrium simulation , in the hope that it will spontaneously exhibit shear flow .",
    "it does not .",
    "so the dilettante updates the program s random number generator and runs it again .",
    "having tenure and little imagination , the physicist repeats this process countless times until , one day , the fluid fluctuates into a state of sustained shear flow .",
    "the delighted simulator records this fluke , but continues the project for many more years until a large number of such accidents have been observed , exhibiting the same shear rate .",
    "finally , the researcher discards an enormous set of simulated trajectories , and publishes only that subset which happened to perform the desired shear . on analysing this subset of trajectories",
    ", one might expect to observe the equilibrium transition rates that were coded into the algorithm .",
    "but this is a biased data set , subject to an _ a posteriori _ constraint of shear flux @xmath34 .",
    "so this sub - set of the equilibrium ensemble exhibits exactly the transition rates specified by eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) .",
    "although the programmer has published a biased account of the equilibrium simulations , there was no unwarranted or subjective bias other than the flux constraint , hence the project was a success in producing the physics of shear flow .",
    "note that , despite extracting a sub - ensemble from the equilibrium ensemble , the lazy physicist has _ not _ produced a near - equilibrium approximation .",
    "the  sub - ensemble dynamics \" of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) has features qualitatively different from the equilibrium dynamics .    in section [ applications ] , i shall use some examples to demonstrate the correctness of the physics generated by sub - ensemble dynamics ( eq .  ( [ relation ] ) ) . before doing so ,",
    "in section [ variants ] , i develop a useful variant of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) , analogous to an alternative thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "equation ( [ relation ] ) gives the frequency of observing a particular trajectory segment ( e.g.  a single transition @xmath27 ) of microscopic duration @xmath29 , in the driven ensemble which is a sub - set ofall trajectories , shown in black in fig .",
    "[ trajectories ] .",
    "these trajectories lie in the extreme tails of the equilibrium distribution .",
    "note that they have common end points , since we have specified the exact net flux that must flow during the duration of the experiment .",
    "any nearby trajectories , that do not have _ exactly _ the specified flux , do not contribute to the quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) .",
    "even very nearby trajectories are completely discarded by eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by re - writing the probability of thespecified flux @xmath34 as a sum over trajectories @xmath0 with fluxes @xmath53 , so that eq .  ( [ relation ] ) becomes @xmath54 here , the dirac delta functions kill all trajectories with anything but the exact net flux @xmath34 .",
    "this can be a disadvantage for practical applications of the formula .",
    "( the lazy physicist , discussed above , must discard data even from simulations that produce _ nearly _ the right flux . )",
    "an alternative expression is now derived , that samples trajectories with less stringent conditions on their eventual flux content .      in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , the constraint of energy conservation is relaxed by dividing the isolated microcanonical system into a relatively small sub - section , defining the canonical system , and the large remainder , known as the reservoir . similarly , we shall relax the strict constraint on the time - averaged flux , by dividing the total trajectory of duration @xmath11 into a part ( see fig .  [ trajectories ] ) of duration @xmath19 ( where @xmath55 ) , whose properties are examined in detail , and the large remaining part of duration @xmath56 , for which the system s motion is uncorrelated with the earlier trajectory segment .",

    "another example of such a model , that was previously discussed only heuristically @xcite , is a set of dimers ( particles that occupy two adjacent lattice sites ) that perform random walks on a two - dimensional triangular lattice , while the lattice itself is driven into shear flow by sporadically cleaving and re - positioning its horizontal layers .",
    "certain arrangements of the dimers ( analogous to @xmath93 states of the comb model ) allow these quanta of shear , while other states ( analogous to @xmath22 states ) are prevented from shearing , due to the unbreakable dimers straddling two layers of the lattice , thus jamming the system .",

    "such arbitrariness is not condoned for equilibrium models , and the same should be the case for macroscopically driven steady states .",
    "for example , consider how we design a stochastic model of an equilibrium system .",
    "the system is defined by some set of available states , and we must choose the rates of transitions between those states .",
    "canonical equilibrium is defined by a fixed volume , particle number , and mean energy of the system .",
    "we might choose any arbitrary set of rates , and then measure or calculate the mean energy that results when the system arrives at a steady state . certainly , that procedure would give rise to a well defined mean energy , volume and number , but that is not sufficient for us to say that the system is at equilibrium and that the transition rates are acceptable .",
    "there are constraints arising from the principle of detailed balance , which ensure that @xmath134 are the _ only _ parameters characterising the macroscopic state of the ensemble , beyond the definition of the system in terms of its accessible states and reversibility .",
    "we have found the generalisation of those constraints to non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "the prior is central to the formalism , and is often misinterpreted in non - equilibrium applications of information theory . in the present context , it is used to mean the complete set of _ physically valid _ paths that a system might take in response to the stochastic forces arising from a particular coupling to a non - equilibrium reservoir .",
    "if the reservoir can exchange energy with the system , then conservation of energy can be violated in the prior .",
    "if the coupling is only to particles at the system s boundary , then energy , momentum and angular momentum must be conserved by all internal interactions , so the prior does not include scenarios for which those laws are violated .",
    "this has not been the usual definition of the prior , in previous attempts at non - equilibrium applications of information theory .",
    "it is often assumed that our knowledge of microscopic dynamics can be discarded , and maxent will correctly reconstruct that missing information .",
