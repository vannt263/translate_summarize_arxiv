    ", the study of black holes in a background anti - de sitter spacetime has been well motivated from developments in string / m - theory , which naturally incorporate black holes as solitonic d - branes , or simply branes as the higher - dimensional progenitors of black holes .",
    "an intriguing example of this is the conjectured duality  @xcite between string theory on @xmath2 background and @xmath3 super yang - mills theory in four dimensions , and in particular , witten s interpretation  @xcite of the hawking - page phase transition between thermal ads and ads black hole  @xcite as the confinement - deconfinement phases of the dual gauge theory defined on the asymptotic boundaries of the ads space .",
    "much effort has been put into the weak ads gravity regime , analyzing the implications of ads black holes on dual ( gauge ) theories at non - zero temperature , using the conjectured ads / cft correspondence . in this context ,",
    "the most interesting black hole solutions are presumably the five dimensional kerr - ads solutions for a stationary black hole  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of ads quantum gravity has been extensively used to infer the thermodynamics of quantum field theory in the large @xmath4 ( or weak field ) limits , with an ads gravity dual , such as schwarzschild - ads  @xcite , kerr - newman - ads  @xcite and hyperbolic - ads  @xcite black holes .",
    "the kerr metric  @xcite is a simple explicit exact solution of the einstein vacuum equations describing a rotating black hole in a four - dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "shortly after kerr s discovery , carter  @xcite provided an elegant generalization of the kerr solution in four - dimensional de - sitter and anti - de sitter backgrounds .",
    "a higher dimensional generalization of kerr metric in a flat background was given by myers and perry  @xcite .",
    "but its generalization to five and higher dimensions with a non - zero cosmological constant was given , only recently , by hawking _",

    "there has been recent interest in constructing the analogous charged rotating solutions in gauged supergravity in four , five and seven dimensions  @xcite , and also on non - uniqueness  @xcite of those solutions in five and higher dimensions .",
    "the study of non - charged rotating ( kerr ) black holes is interesting at least for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the thermodynamics of kerr black holes , in a background ads space , can give rise to interesting descriptions in terms of cfts defined on the ( conformal ) boundary of ads space , leading to a better understanding of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . secondly ,",
    "astronomically relevant black hole spacetimes are , to a very good approximation , may be described by the kerr metric .    as not much is known about the stability of kerr - ads black holes in higher dimensions , in this paper we study the thermodynamic stability of these black holes in five and higher dimensions .",
    "we also investigate the gravitational stability of a background kerr-(a)ds spacetime under metric perturbations .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "ii by outlining the ( anti)-de sitter background metrics in @xmath5 dimensions and their generalizations to kerr - ads solutions . in sec .",
    "iii we pay special attention to the thermodynamic stability of kerr - ads black holes by studying the behavior of hawking temperature , free energy and specific heat in various dimensions . in section",
    "iv we study the gravitational stability of background kerr-(a)ds metrics under linear tensor perturbations .",
    "the stability of a rotating anti - de sitter background spacetime in dimensions higher than four was not previously studied .",
    "our linearized perturbation equations have other interesting applications .",
    "in particular , they allow us to study the stability of background ads metrics with non - trivial rotation parameters .",
    "separability of hamilton - jacobi and klein - gordon equations in the kerr ( anti)-de sitter backgrounds was discussed in  @xcite , especially in the limit when all rotation parameters take the same value , see  @xcite for a discussion in five dimensions . an earlier work on separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation and quantum radiation from a five dimensional kerr black hole with two rotation parameters ,",
    "but in an asymptotically flat background , can be found in  @xcite",
    ". however , our analysis is different .",
    "it corresponds not to a separability of the wave equations for a particle but rather to a separability of radial and angular wave equations under linear tensor perturbations .",
    "one of the interesting features of the kerr metric in ( anti)-de sitter spaces is that it can be written in the so - called kerr - schild form , where the metric @xmath6 is given exactly by its linear approximation around the ( anti)-de sitter metric @xmath7 as follows  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a null geodesic with respect to both the full metric @xmath6 and the ( a)ds metric @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the ricci tensor of @xmath6 is related to that of @xmath10 by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the parameters proportional to the mass and gravitational potential of a kerr black hole respectively .",
    "thus , the stability of a kerr metric under metric perturbation is specific to the stability of the background metric , which is given by @xmath15 .",
    "let us begin with a five dimensional ( anti)-de sitter metric in the standard form : @xmath16 which satisfies @xmath17 , with @xmath18 in ads space .",
    "the apparent singularities at @xmath19 are merely coordinate singularities . by defining @xmath20",
    ", one sees that the coordinate @xmath21 has range @xmath22 while @xmath23 have a period @xmath24 , so @xmath25 parameterizes ( topologically ) a @xmath26-sphere , while @xmath27 parameterizes an @xmath28-fiber .",
    "the metric ( [ 5dads ] ) is easily generalized to six and higher dimensions . in six dimensions",
    ", one has @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the apparent singularities at @xmath19 are again merely coordinate singularities . by defining @xmath33",
    "one easily sees that @xmath34 parameterize ( topologically ) a @xmath35-sphere .",
    "in fact , the generalized ( anti)-de sitter metric can be written in a more compact form : @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( if @xmath5 is odd ) , or @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( if @xmath5 is even ) . both in odd and even dimensions , there are @xmath4 azimuthal coordinates @xmath42 , each with period @xmath24 .",
    "but when @xmath5 is even there is an extra coordinate @xmath43 , which lies in the interval @xmath44 .    in @xmath45 spaces the rotation group is @xmath46 and",
    "the number of independent rotation parameters for a localized object is equal to the number of casimir operators , which is the integer part of @xmath47 .",
    "thus in four dimensions the metric of a kerr black hole can have only one casimir invariant of the rotation group @xmath48 , which is uniquely defined by an axis of rotation , while in five dimensions it can have two independent rotation parameters associated with two possible planes of rotation .",
    "one may introduce to  ( [ compact1 ] ) @xmath4 rotation parameters , for example , using the following coordinate transformation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the constants @xmath1 which are introduced in  ( [ first - co - trans ] ) merely as parameters in a coordinate transformation may be interpreted as genuine rotation parameters after one adds to  ( [ compact1 ] ) the square of an appropriate null vector , as in  ( [ kerr - schild1 ] ) .",
    "using the following coordinate transformations  @xcite : @xmath51 and combining the expressions  ( [ kerr - schild1 ] ) , ( [ compact1 ] ) , ( [ first - co - trans ] ) , one would obtain the kerr ( a)ds metrics in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "we are not going into details of this construction but refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for an elegant discussion . in five dimensions ,",
    "the metric of kerr - ads solution is @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 in the limit @xmath56 , one recovers the standard schwarzschild - ads metric . as we see",
    "shortly , black holes with non - zero rotation parameters , or , in general , kerr - ads black holes , enjoy many interesting properties distinct from schwarzschild - ads black holes .",
    "using the standard technique of background subtraction , gibbons  @xcite have recently calculated the regularized ( euclidean ) actions for the kerr - ads black holes in arbitrary @xmath57 dimensions .",
    "the results are @xmath58 for odd @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for even @xmath61 , where @xmath62},\\ ] ] is the volume of the unit @xmath63-sphere . in the above",
    "we have defined @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the curvature radius of the ( bulk ) ads space .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are : @xmath66 and @xmath67 . , where , as usual , @xmath68 is the radius of the horizon , which occurs at a root of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the hawking temperature , which is the inverse of euclidean period , @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 for odd @xmath5 and @xmath73 for even @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of total energy in an asymptotically ( a)ds background is somewhat trickier ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , mainly because the analogous komar integral for the relevant time - like killing vector diverges , which then requires a regularization , see also ref.@xcite which presents a general analysis for the conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics for the four dimensional kerr - newman - ads and the five dimensional kerr - ads black holes . in this context , the conserved charges ( energies ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 associated with different killing vectors , respectively , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are different .",
    "however , the calculation of free energy itself is unambiguous .",
    "in fact , one can always identify the free energy of a kerr - ads black hole as @xmath78 , and hence @xmath79 this result is modified from that of a schwarzschild - ads black hole by certain terms in the product which are now functions of @xmath80 and the rotation parameters @xmath81 .      in four spacetime dimensions",
    "black holes are stable ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but the issue of stability may be raised in five and higher dimensions .",
    "the five - dimensional kerr - ads solutions are particularly interesting as these could be embedded into iib supergravity in ten dimensions .    from  ( [ free - energy - gen ] )",
    ", it is readily seen that a phase transition between the background ads space and the black hole is set by the scale @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 corresponds to ads black hole ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 to a thermal ads space ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this behavior may be seen also in terms of the charge or potential if present . in general ,",
    "when the values of the rotation parameters @xmath81 are decreased , the free energy lowers towards zero at low temperature . for @xmath87 , in the small @xmath80 region , @xmath88 nearly approaches but never touches the @xmath89 axis ( see figs . @xmath90 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "that is , the free energy curve crosses the @xmath89 axis only once , namely when @xmath82 , which usually corresponds to the hawking - page phase transition point .",
    "but , in dimensions @xmath91 , this alone does not mean that a first order phase transition of hawking - page type is essentially present .    in five dimensions , with @xmath92 ,",
    "there is a minimum @xmath80 below which the temperature appears to be negative and also diverges as @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "in fact , there is a minimum in temperature below which the kerr black holes simply do not exit . nevertheless , the plots in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] show the free energy can be a well defined function of temperature .",
    "we also note that the specific heat is a monotonically increasing function of temperature when @xmath94 .",
    "the hawking temperature of a kerr - ads black hole with a non - vanishing rotation parameter approaches zero as @xmath80 goes to zero .",
    "the free energy is still a smooth function of both the horizon size and the temperature ( see figs .",
    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "these all imply a thermodynamic stability of a small kerr black hole in @xmath95 space .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior above is essentially the opposite in six dimensions , where the temperature always diverges at @xmath96 . as the plots in figs .",
    "[ figure5][figure8 ] show the thermodynamics of single parameter solutions are quite different from those with equal rotation parameters .",
    "we also note that the @xmath84 region in figs .",
    "[ figure9][figure12 ] corresponds to @xmath83 , while the region @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath91 , in the case of equal rotation parameters , only small black holes are globally preferred and locally stable , while in the case of single rotation parameter , a thermal ads phase is more preferred .",
    "the behavior in five dimensions is special in that there is no high temperature thermal ads phase regardless of the choice of rotation parameters .",
    "one of the simplest ways of calculating the energy in an asymptotically ads background is to integrate the first law of ( bulk ) thermodynamics : @xmath99 where the entropy @xmath100 and angular momenta ( of a rotating black hole ) @xmath101 are defined via @xmath102 where @xmath103 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass ( energy ) of kerr ads black hole was evaluated , by demanding _ as a priori _ that entropy of the black hole is one - quarter the area , @xmath104 , in order to satisfy  ( [ firstlaw ] ) .",
    "the results are @xmath105 @xmath106 this result differs from the expression of energy suggested by hawking _",
    "et al . _ in  @xcite , both in odd and even dimensions , @xmath107 the reason for this is that the energy  ( [ energy - hawking ] ) is measured in a frame rotating at infinity with the angular velocities : @xmath108 instead of  ( [ ang - velo ] ) . since the angular velocities differ by @xmath109 , the two results above , ( [ energy - odd - d ] ) or ( [ energy - even - d ] ) , ( [ energy - hawking ] ) , agree only in the limit @xmath110 ( i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "the energy of background ads spacetime ( i.e. @xmath112 ) is expected to be the same as the casimir energy of a dual field theory in one dimension lower , up to a conformal factor .",
    "but from the above result one finds @xmath113 when @xmath112 . to understand this apparent discrepancy",
    ", it should be noted that the adm mass @xmath13 is only a local definition of black hole energy , while the total energy of a localized object in a curved background normally takes into account the asymptotic value of the background itself ( which is non - zero in the ads space ) . and , in general , one can write @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is an integration constant .",
    "for example , for a schwarzschild - ads black hole with hyperbolic symmetry ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath115 may be given by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the black hole mass at the extremal limit , see e.g.  @xcite .      a black hole as a thermodynamic system is unstable if it has negative specific heat .",
    "as it known , small schwarzschild - ads black holes ( i.e. with @xmath119 ) have negative specific heat but large size black holes have positive specific heat .",
    "while there also exists a discontinuity of the specific heat as a function of temperature at @xmath120 , and so small and large black holes are found to be somewhat disjoint objects .",
    "however , this is essentially not the case when some of @xmath1 are non - trivial , and especially , when @xmath121 , e.g. , the small kerr black holes in @xmath95 space also have positive specific heat .    to this end",
    ", we shall study the thermodynamic stability of a kerr - ads black hole by evaluating its specific heat , which is given by @xmath122 figures  [ figure13 ] and [ figure14 ] show the plots of energy and temperature differentials as functions of the horizon size @xmath80 . in the @xmath123 case , with equal rotation parameters ,",
    "there is clearly a minimum @xmath80 , below which the temperature diverges .",
    "there is also a minimum value of rotation parameter below which @xmath124 can be negative , which is @xmath125 in five dimensions . above this value ,",
    "both the temperature differential and the specific heat are positive , see figs .",
    "[ figure15 ] and [ figure16 ] .",
    "when plotted as a function of temperature , the minimum of energy corresponds to the minimum in temperature , and hence the specific heat is a monotonically increasing function of hawking temperature .",
    "this is also the case with a single rotation parameter ( see fig .",
    "[ figure17 ] ) , but now the critical value is @xmath126 .    it should also be noted that , with @xmath123 and @xmath127 , the thermodynamic behavior of a kerr - ads black hole at high temperature can be very different from that at low temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ figure17 ] ) .",
    "a similar behavior is found in the case of a single non - vanishing rotation parameter , though up to a slightly larger value of @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "put another way , in the @xmath95 background , small rotating black holes are unstable only for rotation parameters of order @xmath130 or less ; the precise limit is dimension dependent and black holes with larger angular velocities are thermodynamically stable .",
    "similarly , in dimensions @xmath91 , the kerr - ads black holes become unstable below some critical values of rotation parameters , for which a new branch would appear . when @xmath131 , with equal rotation parameters , the critical value is @xmath132 ( see figs .  [ figure18][figure20 ] ) and it is slightly higher in the case of a single rotation parameter .    looking at the behavior of free energy and specific heat as functions of horizon position @xmath80 , we remark that a five dimensional kerr - ads black hole with a single rotation parameter is thermodynamically more stable over two ( equal ) rotation parameter solutions . but",
    "this is essentially not the case in dimensions six or more .    in all odd dimensions ,",
    "the specific heat has a single branch at high rotation but two branches at low rotations : the critical value of @xmath128 which distinguishes these two cases increases with the number dimensions , and also with number of non - trivial rotation parameters .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in all even dimensions @xmath91 , but in this case an interesting difference is that the specific heat can never be zero with @xmath133 .",
    "it seems relevant to ask what happens at the critical angular velocity limit , @xmath134 .",
    "apparently , the action as well as the entropy is divergent in this limit .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , there exists a scaling of the mass parameter @xmath135 which makes the physical charges of the configuration finite . with equal rotation parameters , when @xmath136 , a kerr - ads black hole is more preferred than a thermal ads phase even at low temperature .",
    "in fact , in all dimensions @xmath91 , small kerr - ads black holes with a single non - vanishing rotation parameter are unstable .    in our plots",
    "we have used the energy expressions suggested by gibbons _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which differ from those suggested by hawking _",
    "_  @xcite by some overall constant factors .",
    "this itself does not introduce any significant difference in the behavior of specific heat and hence the thermodynamic stability of kerr - ads solutions . at any rate ,",
    "the energy measured in a non - rotating frame appeared more suggestive to be used because it can be derived using various other methods  @xcite ; the energy ( or total mass ) expressions given in  @xcite , however , disagree with those in  @xcite in odd spacetime dimensions .",
    "it was shown recently in @xcite that at fixed entropy , the temperature of a rotating black hole is bounded above by that of a non - rotating black hole , in four and five dimensions , but not in six or more dimensions .",
    "we verify this claim by plotting temperature as a function of entropy , in various dimensions ; some of the plots are depicted in figs .",
    "[ figure21]-[figure23 ] . in dimensions six or more",
    ", the minimum of entropy is not always the minimum of temperature , it actually depends upon the choice of rotation parameters .",
    "this is precisely the case where the inequality @xmath137 may be realized with a very small entropy .",
    "but in this limit the temperature actually diverges , so the effect like this might be absent in a physical picture . at fixed entropy , but @xmath138 , the hawking temperature of a rotating black hole is always suppressed relative to that of a non - rotating black hole and the inequality @xmath139 holds in all dimensions .",
    "this result , presumably , holds with various charges and classical matter fields ( such as gauge fields , dilaton , etc ) and is in accord with the earlier observation made by visser while studying a static spherically symmetric case in four dimensions with no cosmological term  @xcite .",
    "a five dimensional kerr - ads black hole with a single non - vanishing rotation parameter possesses an interesting ( and perhaps desirable ) feature ; in this case the entropy vanishes when the temperature becomes zero .",
    "a similar feature is present in seven dimensions , but with two equal rotation parameters : @xmath140 , @xmath141 .    in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "on the evolution of a five dimensional rotating black hole via the scalar field radiation , maeda  observed that , in a flat background ( @xmath142 ) , the asymptotic state of a five dimensional rotating black hole with a single non - vanishing parameter is described by @xmath143 .",
    "it would be interesting to know a similar result in an anti - de sitter background , @xmath18 .",
    "following  @xcite , one would expect the partition function of a kerr - ads black hole to be related to the partition function of a cft in a rotating einstein universe on the ( conformal ) boundary of the ads space .    a curious observation in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the cardy - verlinde entropy formula works more naturally using the bulk thermodynamic variables defined by hawking _",
    "et al . _",
    "this seems to indicate that the energy expression ( [ energy - hawking ] ) is still relevant in a dual cft .",
    "the killing vector is then given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 are the angular coordinates .",
    "this property normally allows the thermal radiation to rotate with black hole s angular velocity all the way to conformal infinity .    one could ask whether or not the bulk thermodynamic variables suggested by gibbons",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which were measured with respect to a frame that is non - rotating at infinity , can be mapped onto the boundary cft variables by using the usual scaling argument .",
    "this does not seem to be the case as long as the cft is assumed to be on a surface of large @xmath80 in boyer - linquist coordinates .",
    "however , such a mapping might exist when the cft is assumed to be on a large spherical surface , that is one for which the coordinate @xmath146 at large @xmath147 .",
    "that is to say , it is possible that the set of bulk variables for kerr - ads black holes given by gibbons _ et al._@xcite , in some ( modified ) form , match onto the boundary cft variables that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "this was indeed shown to be the case in  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss the role of non - trivial rotation parameters on the existence of an equilibrium between kerr - ads black hole and rotating thermal radiation around it .",
    "for this the requirement of a positive specific heat is a necessary condition . in five dimensions ,",
    "the specific heat is always positive and also a monotonically increasing function of temperature when one ( or both ) of the rotation parameters takes a value at least one - quarter the ads length scale @xmath65 .",
    "this means , unlike in minkowski ( infinite ) space , the rotating kerr - ads black holes can be in equilibrium with rotating thermal radiation around it , when @xmath148 ; that is , the rotation parameter is not significantly smaller than the ads curvature radius , so as to attain a stable equilibrium .",
    "in this section we study the gravitational stability of kerr - ads background metrics ( with @xmath15 ) in dimensions five and higher . for this purpose , it is sufficient to consider the following @xmath5-dimensional ( time - independent ) metric _ ansatz _ : @xmath149 where the metric @xmath150 is effectively separated into two parts : a diagonal `` bulk '' line element and @xmath151 , which is the metric on an @xmath152-dimensional base manifold whose curvature has not been specified , ( so @xmath153 or @xmath154 ) , and hence can be replaced by any einstein - khler metric with the same scalar curvature .",
    "however , in the present work we study only the @xmath155 case , and hence the base @xmath156 may be viewed as an @xmath28 fiber over @xmath157 ( for odd @xmath152 ) or as @xmath158 ( for even @xmath152 ) . for example , in the @xmath123 ( or @xmath159 ) case , the event horizon is @xmath160 .    under a small linear metric perturbation @xmath161 with @xmath162 , the variation in the ricci tensor",
    "is given by @xmath163 where the spin-2 lichnerowicz operator @xmath164 is defined by ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) @xmath165 the stability of background metrics of the form  ( [ metric - gen ] ) with @xmath166 , under certain metric perturbations , is specific to tensor perturbations .",
    "we therefore would like to restrict our analysis here to the tensor mode fluctuations that satisfy @xmath167 unless @xmath168 , where the indices @xmath169 run from @xmath170 and the indices @xmath171 will run from @xmath172 for the @xmath152-dimensional base .",
    "the variation of the ricci tensor on the base @xmath173 must then satisfy @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the @xmath5-dimensional cosmological constant , with @xmath176 h_{i j}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\nu=1}^{d - n}\\left[\\partial^\\sigma g_{\\sigma \\nu } -\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\sigma\\rho}\\partial_\\nu g_{\\sigma\\rho } + ( 4-n)\\frac{\\partial_\\nu\\gamma}{\\gamma}\\right]\\partial^\\nu h_{ij}\\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{4}{\\gamma^2}\\left[g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu \\gamma(x ) \\partial_\\nu \\gamma(x)\\right ] h_{i j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 is the spin-2 lichnerowicz operator acting on the base @xmath173 .",
