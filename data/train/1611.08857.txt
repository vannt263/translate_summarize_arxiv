    "the assouad dimension is an important concept in geometric measure theory and analysis . roughly speaking it quantifies the ` thickest ' part of a given metric space , and appears naturally in a wide variety of contexts , such as embedding theory . indeed , proving his celebrated embedding theorem was assouad s main motivation for studying and popularising the concept during his phd @xcite .",
    "generally , we will be interested in ` how big ' a set @xmath0 is at a small scale @xmath1 ( as @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is made precise by the covering function @xmath3 which is defined to be the minimal number of @xmath4-balls required to cover @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the ( upper ) box dimension extracts the smallest exponent @xmath5 such that @xmath6 as @xmath2 .",
    "the assouad dimension , on the other hand , considers two scales @xmath7 .",
    "the large scale @xmath8 focuses ones attention on a small @xmath8-ball @xmath9 centered in @xmath10 and then one extracts the smallest exponent @xmath5 such that @xmath11 for some constant @xmath12 and for all centres and pairs of scales . in @xcite",
    "we proposed the following modification of the assouad dimension where one _ fixes _ the relationship between the two scales .",
    "more precisely , we define the _ assouad spectrum _ of a nonempty set @xmath0 in a metric space to be the function @xmath13 where @xmath14 varies over @xmath15 . if one replaced @xmath16 by a ` free scale ' @xmath17 , then one obtains the familiar assouad dimension , which we denote by @xmath18 .",
    "we also consider a ` dual spectrum ' , which is motivated by the lower dimension .",
    "the _ lower spectrum _ is given by the function @xmath19 where @xmath14 varies over @xmath15 .",
    "again , if one replaced @xmath16 by a ` free scale ' @xmath17 , then one obtains the familiar lower dimension , which we denote by @xmath20 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the basic properties of the assouad and lower spectra .",
    "we will sometimes refer to specific results from @xcite when we require them , but we summarise the most important properties in the following section .",
    "the key motivation behind these assouad type spectra is that they provide more detailed and precise information about the scaling structure of the space . in particular , one obtains a spectrum of exponents , rather than a single one . in this paper",
    "we will explicitly compute the spectra in a variety of important contexts .",
    "what we find is that the spectra display a wide variety of different features and forms , reflecting the differences between the models we consider .",
    "specifically , our main results are contained in four virtually stand alone sections where we consider : self - affine carpets ( section [ carpetssect ] ) , self - similar and self - conformal sets with overlaps ( section [ self - similarsect ] ) , mandelbrot percolation ( section [ mandelbrotsect ] ) , and moran constructions ( section [ moransection ] ) .",
    "we begin with a summary of some notation we will use throughout the paper . for real - valued functions @xmath21 , we write @xmath22 to mean that there exists a universal constant @xmath23 , independent of @xmath24 , such that @xmath25",
    ". some readers may be more familiar with the notation @xmath26 , which is sometimes more convenient and means the same thing .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 means that @xmath28 with a universal constant independent of @xmath24 . if both @xmath22 and @xmath27 , then we write @xmath29",
    ". generally one should think of @xmath24 as being the tuple consisting of all variables in the expression ` @xmath30 ' .    for a real number @xmath31 , we write @xmath32 to denote a real number that is strictly larger than @xmath31 but can be chosen as close to @xmath31 as we wish .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath33 to denote a real number that is strictly less than @xmath31 but can be chosen as close to @xmath31 as we wish . for real numbers",
    "@xmath34 , we write @xmath35 for the minimum of the two numbers and @xmath36 for the maximum . also , for a non - negative real number @xmath37 , we write @xmath38 $ ] for the integer part of @xmath24 .",
    "the assouad and lower spectra are closely related to the upper and lower box dimension .",
    "upper _ and _ lower box dimensions _ of a totally bounded set @xmath0 are defined by @xmath39 and if the upper and lower box dimensions coincide we call the common value the _ box dimension _ of @xmath0 and denote it by @xmath40 . note that , similar to the assouad and lower spectra , the covering function @xmath41 can be taken to be numerous related covering or packing functions and it is sometimes convenient to use a variety of different definitions in practice . in particular we note the following general relationships which hold for any totally bounded set @xmath0 : @xmath42 for more detailed information on dimension theory and the basic properties of the various dimensions we consider here , we refer the reader to @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we conducted a thorough investigation of the analytic and geometric properties of the assouad and lower spectra .",
    "some of the key properties we will use in this paper are as follows :    1 .",

    "self - affine sets are an important class of fractal subsets of euclidean space .",
    "they are attractors of finite iterated function systems consisting of affine contractions . due to the fact that affine maps can scale by different amounts in different directions ,",
    "the dimension theory of self - affine sets is much more complicated than their self - similar counter parts ; where the defining maps are similarities .",
    "self - affine sets have been studied intensively for over 30 years and have important connections with many other fields , such as non - conformal dynamical systems . an important contribution to this area was bedford and mcmullen s independent treatments of a restricted class of self - affine sets @xcite .",
    "these ` bedford - mcmullen carpets ' are planar self - affine sets where the affine maps all have the same linear part ; which is a simple diagonal matrix .",
    "these sets are much simpler than general self - affine sets , but still display many of the key features : the maps scale by different amounts in the two principle directions and so the constituent pieces become increasingly elongated as one iterates the construction . due to their simple and explicit form ,",
    "the dimension theory of bedford - mcmullen carpets is rather well - developed .",
    "indeed , bedford and mcmullen computed their hausdorff and box dimensions in the mid-1980s , mackay computed their assouad dimensions in 2011 @xcite , and fraser computed their lower dimensions in 2014 @xcite . in this section we give explicit formulae for the assouad and lower spectra .",
    "we begin by recalling the construction .",

    "we thus obtain a symbolic coding of the set @xmath0 , but we note that some points may not have a unique code .",
    "the set @xmath0 can be viewed in several other contexts .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is the attractor of the _ iterated function system _ ( ifs ) @xmath63 , i.e. it is the unique non - empty compact set satisfying @xmath64 in the context of hyperbolic dynamical systems , bedford - mcmullen carpets are also of particular interest . identifying @xmath48 ^ 2 $ ] with the 2-torus in the natural way , @xmath0 is a ( forward and backward ) invariant repeller for the hyperbolic toral endomorphism @xmath65     and @xmath66 and on the right @xmath67 and @xmath68.[carpets],width=472 ]    in order to state the dimension results mentioned above we need some more notation .",
    "let @xmath69 be the projection onto the first coordinate .",
    "for @xmath70 , let @xmath71 be the number of chosen rectangles in the @xmath72th column , let @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "[ carpetdimensions ] the assouad , box , hausdorff and lower dimensions of a bedford - mcmullen carpet @xmath0 are given by @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78    observe that the term @xmath79 appears in three of the dimension formulae .",
    "this is the dimension of the self - similar projection of @xmath0 onto the first coordinate .",
    "where this term appears , the second term relates to the dimension of fibres : for the assouad dimension , @xmath80 is the maximal fibre dimension ( also given by a self - similar set ) , for the lower dimension , @xmath81 is the minimal fibre dimension and , for the box dimension , the second term can be interpreted as an ` average fibre dimension ' , observing that @xmath82 is the arithmetic average of the @xmath83 .",
    "the box , hausdorff , assouad and lower dimensions coincide if and only if @xmath83 is the same for all @xmath84 , commonly referred to as the _ uniform fibres case _ , and otherwise they are all distinct , see @xcite .",
    "before we discuss our main results we provide a minor addition to theorem [ carpetdimensions ] .",
    "the lower dimension is well - known to have many strange properties which may not be seen as desirable for a ` dimension ' to satisfy .",
    "for example , it is not monotone and it may take the value 0 for sets with non - empty interior , see ( * ? ?",
    "* example 2.5 ) .",
    "one can modify the definition to get rid of these ( perhaps ) strange properties by defining the _ modified lower dimension _ by @xmath85 we mention this here simply to point out that this can be computed for self - affine carpets as a direct consequence of results of ferguson - jordan - shmerkin @xcite and the formula for the lower dimension given by fraser @xcite .",

    "[ modifiedlower ] the modified lower dimension of a bedford - mcmullen carpet @xmath0 is given by @xmath86 moreover , it is also true that if @xmath0 is a self - affine carpet of the type considered by baraski @xcite or lalley - gatzouras @xcite , then @xmath87 we refer the readers to @xcite for the precise formulae .    since the modified lower dimension of a compact set",
    "is always bounded above by the hausdorff dimension we need only prove the lower bound .",
    "it suffices to prove that for any @xmath88 we can find a subset of @xmath0 which has lower dimension within @xmath89 of the hausdorff dimension . via an elegant application of stirling s formula , ferguson - jordan - shmerkin ( *",

    "[ carpetsspectrum],width=548 ]    a , perhaps surprising , corollary of theorem [ carpetsspectra ] is that the lower spectra is not uniformly bounded above by the hausdorff or modified lower dimension .",
    "this might be surprising because the lower spectrum is based on the lower dimension , which _ is _ bounded above by the hausdorff and modified lower dimension for compact sets .",
    "the assouad spectrum does not violate any of the general inequalities between the assouad dimension and the other common dimensions since it is uniformly bounded below by the upper box dimension , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.1 ) .",
    "in fact it follows that for any bedford - mcmullen carpet with non - uniform fibres there will be an open interval @xmath106 within which the lower spectrum is strictly larger than the hausdorff and modified lower dimension .",
    "this follows since for such carpets the lower spectrum is continuous and converges to the box dimension as @xmath107 which is strictly larger than the hausdorff and modified lower dimension .",

    "theorem [ carpetsspectra ] proves that the ratio @xmath108 is a bi - lipschitz invariant within the class of bedford - mcmullen carpets . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this has not been observed before . since",
    "sets are bi - lipschitz equivalent to themselves this invariant can be useful in determining what kinds of affine ifss give rise to a particular carpet .",

    "assume that @xmath0 does not have uniform fibres and that it can also be viewed as a bedford - mcmullen carpet generated by an ifs using an @xmath110 grid for some @xmath111 .",
    "then we may conclude that @xmath112 the question of when two bedford - mcmullen carpets are bi - lipschitz equivalent has been considered by li - li - miao @xcite , where they give positive results assuming some natural conditions , including that @xmath113 are constant . in some sense , our results compliment these results as we provide a mechanism for proving negative results .",
    "we demonstrate this by the following example .",
    "[ t2 ] we can find two topologically equivalent bedford - mcmullen carpets with the same box counting , lower and assouad dimensions , but different spectra . therefore @xmath10 and @xmath0 are not bi - lipschitz invariant despite this not being revealed by knowledge of the other dimensions .",
    "we construct the first bedford - mcmullen carpet such that @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath101 and the second carpet such that @xmath114 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , we may choose the rectangles satisfying these parameters so that they do not touch each other , rendering both carpets totally disconnected and thus homeomorphic .",
    "it follows from theorem [ carpetdimensions ] that for both carpets @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 but , since the ratio @xmath126 is not the same for both constructions , they necessarily have different spectra .    for the above examples",
    ", we guaranteed the spectra would be different by ensuring that @xmath127 .",
    "this turns out to be necessary in finding such examples .",
    "the following corollary expresses this precisely and follows immediately by rearranging the formulae given in theorems [ carpetdimensions ] and [ carpetsspectra ] .",
    "the dimension spectra of bedford - mcmullen carpets are completely determined by the ratio @xmath128 and the box , lower and assouad dimensions of the carpet .",

    "these strips are images of @xmath0 under @xmath158-fold compositions of maps from @xmath63 and so to keep track of how many there are , one counts rectangles in the appropriate columns for each map in the composition .",

    ", width=453 ]    the assouad dimension of a lalley - gatzouras carpet is given by a formula similar to that used in the bedford - mcmullen case .",
    "indeed , it is equal to the dimension of the projection onto the first coordinate plus the largest dimension corresponding to a particular column .",
    "this is related to ` tangent sets ' having a ` product structure ' , see @xcite .",

    "when @xmath190 , the approximate squares have a ` discretised product structure ' viewed at the pair of scales @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , if @xmath191 , then one has to iterate the construction for a longer time before the height of the basic sets is roughly @xmath16 .",
    "this means the approximate squares lose their discrete product structure and the box dimension starts to contribute to the formula for the spectrum .",
    "we would expect a similar phenomena to occur for lalley - gatzouras sets , but different columns may have a different _ threshold _ for witnessing a product structure .",
    "for example , suppose the column with the largest dimension , i.e. , the one which contributes to the assouad dimension consisted only of @xmath192 rectangles .",
    "this would give rise to a discrete product structure ( and so the assouad spectrum would be equal to the assouad dimension ) for @xmath193 , but for smaller values of @xmath14 the spectrum would decay towards the box dimension . however ,",
    "if there was another column which corresponded to a smaller dimension but which consisted only of @xmath194 rectangles , then this column would allow a discrete product structure to appear on small scales for @xmath195 .",
    "this would mean that the assouad spectrum was at least equal to the dimension of the projection plus the dimension corresponding to the second column for @xmath196 .",
    "we expect that this could lead to phase transitions at @xmath197 and @xmath198 ; recall that the assouad spectrum in the bedford - mcmullen case always has precisely one phase transition .",
    "moreover , by carefully arranging many columns which have smaller dimension as the log - log eccentricity increases could lead to the same phenomena many times , perhaps leading to arbitrarily many phase transitions .",
    "computing the dimension spectra in this setting seems like a delicate and interesting problem . even in the simpler subcase ( which we allude to here ) where the matrices are constant within each column seems challenging and probably a good place to start .",
    "the advantage of this case is that each column has a well - defined log - log eccentricity .",
    "what are the dimension spectra for the more general self - affine carpets considered by lalley - gatzouras and baraski ?",
    "another possible generalisation of our results on self - affine sets would be to consider the higher dimensional analogue of the bedford - mcmullen carpets ; the so - called _ self - affine sponges_. these were first considered by kenyon and peres @xcite and recently the assouad and lower dimensions were computed by fraser and howroyd @xcite . here",
    "the maps act on @xmath199-dimensional space ( instead of the plane ) and the matrices associated to the affine maps are constantly equal to @xmath200 for some fixed integers @xmath201 .",
    "again we believe that more complicated spectra are possible , with phase transitions possibly occurring at the @xmath202 ( possibly distinct ) ratios @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "recall that in the ( non - uniform fibres ) planar case precisely one phase transition occurs at the ratio @xmath205 .",
    "what are the dimension spectra for self - affine sponges ?",
    "self - similar and self - conformal sets are another important class of fractals generated by iterated function systems .",
    "they are simpler than the self - affine sets considered in the previous section in that the defining maps locally scale by the same amount in every direction .",
    "if the constituent pieces making up the set do not overlap too much , then the situation is quite straightforward and it follows from standard results that the lower and assouad dimensions coincide , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.11 ) , rendering the dimension spectra not interesting .",
    "however , if there are overlaps in the construction then fraser proved that the assouad dimension can be strictly larger than the upper box dimension , but the lower dimension always equals the upper box dimension , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 and corollary 2.11 ) .",
    "therefore , the interesting problem is to consider the assouad spectrum in the case of complicated overlaps .",

    "this is a very simple observation , but it allows one to build examples with lower spectrum equal to @xmath515 which has not been seen yet and tends not to turn up as naturally as the analogous formula for the assouad spectrum .",

    "this can be done by choosing as many first level vertices as there are sets @xmath524 and then mimicking the constructions of each @xmath524 independently within each first level child . finally , using the fact that the assouad spectrum is stable under taking finite unions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1 ) , the assouad spectrum of @xmath391 is given by the maximum of the assouad spectra of the @xmath524 .",
    "finally , by ` inverting ' the construction of each @xmath524 to @xmath525 as above , we get a corresponding example with lower spectrum mirroring the assouad spectrum of the initial example .",

    "* proposition 4.1 ) .",
    "some examples of this type are given in figure [ moranfig ] , with the details below .",

    "an arbitrarily large ( but finite ) number of disjoint intervals where the spectrum is constant ( with different constants ) .",
    "3 .   as @xmath14 approaches 1 ,",
    "the spectra approach intermediate values , not equal to any of the familiar dimensions .      for completeness",
    "we provide the precise construction data for the above examples .",

    "the third example is produced with three basic moran constructions .",
    "the first two have @xmath528 and @xmath535 , and @xmath536 and @xmath531 , respectively , and the third one is again the construction with assouad dimension 1 and upper box dimension 0 ."
