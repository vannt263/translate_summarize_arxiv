    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most luminous objects in the universe .",
    "they emit large amounts of radiation over a wide range of wave - bands ( from radio to @xmath6-rays ) , and sometimes produce relativistic jets .",
    "it is a goal of modern astronomy to understand the origin of the extreme activities in agn .",
    "one of the key observational clues in the x - ray band to understand agn is the iron line profile in the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "a broad and skewed line feature around 57  kev was clearly detected by asca for the first time in an energy spectrum of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 @xcite . since then , a similar feature was detected by asca from several seyfert galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the broad and skewed feature has been interpreted as an iron fluorescent line originating from the innermost region of an accretion disk ( @xcite , so - called `` disk - line '' model ) . in this model , a broad and skewed feature is explained by the combination of doppler broadening due to the relativistic motion of the line emitting matter and gravitational redshift due to the central massive black hole .",
    "if the broad and skewed feature in the energy spectra is really a `` disk - line '' , we can determine the inclination angle of the accretion disk through an analysis of the line profile @xcite .",
    "however , the thus - obtained inclination angle is sometimes inconsistent with that estimated with other methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it may also be inconsistent with an expectation from the unified scheme , in which the accretion disk in seyfert 2 galaxies should have an edge - on geometry .",
    "asca observations have revealed the presence of a broad and skewed line feature in several seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the inclination angles have been deduced for these seyfert galaxies from an analysis of the `` disk - line '' , and always found to be around @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this inclination angle is unexpectedly small .",
    "this problem may be partially solved if we assume that the line is a composite and consists of a narrow line centered at 6.4  kev and a disk line with intermediate inclination angle @xcite .",
    "however , we still need an observational confirmation on such a composite model .    ngc  4151 is a bright , nearby seyfert galaxy ( type 1.5 ; @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) . the presence of the broad and skewed line feature in 4.57.5  kev has been known through asca observations @xcite .",
    "thus , ngc  4151 is one of the best targets to precisely study the line feature .",
    "a `` disk - line '' analysis of ngc  4151 has resulted in a face - on geometry of the accretion disk @xcite , while observations of the [ o iii ] @xmath85007 image with the hubble space telescope indicate an inclination angle of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency might be partially resolved if we assume two disk lines and an additional narrow peak centered at 6.4  kev to reproduce the profile @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how the two disk lines with different inclination angles can be produced simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the broad and skewed feature observed from ngc  4151 using a model - independent method as much as possible , and try to identify the origin of the feature . for this purpose",
    ", we analyze the long observations of ngc  4151 made with asca ( in 2000 ) and rxte ( in 1999 ) , while focusing on the spectral variations on various time scales .",
    "the results from another set of long asca observations of ngc  4151 have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the primary asca data set used for the present analysis was acquired from 2000 may 13 through 25 . concerning the instrumentation on board asca , see the following references : @xcite for a general description of asca , @xcite for the x - ray telescope , @xcite and @xcite for the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) , and @xcite for the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) . in the observations ,",
    "sis was operated in the 1-ccd faint mode and gis in the standard ph mode .",
    "a lower level discriminator was applied to sis at 0.48  kev to avoid telemetry saturation due to flickering pixels .",
    "the data selection criteria for sis and gis are summarized in table  [ tbl : crit ] . when the elevation angle , i.e.  the angle between the field of view and the earth limb , was less than @xmath10 , the data were discarded because they were affected by scattered x - rays from the day earth or by the absorption due to the atmosphere .",
    "some of the optical light leakage is known in sis , and the sis data obtained when the elevation from the day earth was less than @xmath11 were discarded .",
    "the data with telemetry saturation are also discarded to avoid any deterioration of the detection efficiency .",
    "the net exposure of sis was about 350  ks , which spans @xmath12  s , and an average count rate of sis was 0.8  count  s@xmath13 after data screening and reduction .",
    "an x - ray source was detected with both sis and gis at a position consistent with the optical position of ngc  4151 within the positional accuracy of asca . a bl lac object ( 1207 + 39w4 ; @xcite )",
    "was detected in the field of view of asca about north of ngc  4151 .",
    "contamination by this source was found to be negligible above 2  kev , which was used for the current data analysis . according to the chandra observations , a faint source was also present at from ngc  4151 to the southwest @xcite .",
    "this source was not resolved with asca .",
    "contamination by this source was completely negligible .",
    "the energy spectra and light curves of each detector were accumulated from a circular region centered on the source . the extraction radius of sis was set to , which is the maximum radius fit in both chips , on the whole .",
    "the background spectra of sis are accumulated from the source free region on the chip .",
    "the extraction radius of gis was set to 6  arcmin , because various calibrations of gis had been done with this standard extraction radius .",
    "the background data of gis were accumulated from a circular region opposite to the target position against the bore - sight axis , excluding the source region .",
    "we usually obtained 4 sets of energy spectra from the asca data , two from sis and the other two from gis , for a single set of observations . to make the analysis simple",
    ", we summed up the two energy spectra from sis and the two corresponding response matrices , respectively , which produced a single sis spectrum with the corresponding response .",
    "similarly , we summed up the two gis spectra and the corresponding responses , respectively .",
    "the summed sis and gis spectra were fitted with a model spectrum simultaneously .",
    "the simultaneous fitting made a full utilization of the asca data in the sense that the higher detection efficiency below 5  kev and better energy resolution of sis , and the higher detection efficiency above 5  kev of gis are all reflected in the best - fit spectral parameters . because there is 3% uncertainty of flux normalization between sis and gis , a systematic error of 3%",
    "was conservatively added to the sis energy spectra in the simultaneous fitting .",
    "although a decrement of sis detection efficiency below 2  kev was reported by the instrument team ( t. yaqoob , private communications ) , we did not include the effect in the analysis because the spectral fittings were carried out only for the energy range above 2  kev .",
    "data obtained by the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) were also used in the present analysis .",
    "details of rxte and pca can be found in @xcite .",
    "rxte observations of ngc  4151 were carried out every @xmath45  days from the beginning of 1999 to study the long - term variations of the x - ray flux .",
    "we used the data obtained from 1999 january 1 through july 24 , which were publicly available from the archive in heasarc at the time of data analysis .",
    "reduction of the pca data was carried out using the standard procedure @xcite . in the analysis , we discarded data obtained when the elevation from the earth limb was less than @xmath14 , data obtained within 30  minute after the satellite s passage of saa , data obtained when the pointing offset was greater than , and data when the count rate of electrons was greater than 0.1 .",
    "the background spectra were calculated using a faint - source model according to a method described in the rxte cook book .",
    "figure  [ fig : ascalc ] shows the x - ray light curve at 0.710  kev from ngc  4151 obtained with asca gis on 2000 may 1325 . here",
    ", the data are shown in 5.6  ks binning .",
    "this 5.6  ks bin - time corresponds to the orbital period of asca around the earth .",
    "we chose this bin time because : ( 1 ) time variations shorter than the orbital period were not significant , ( 2 ) data gaps are usually much shorter than the orbital period and we can get continuous light curve , ( 3 ) possible background variations , which are correlated with the orbital period , could be largely reduced .",
    "note that data gaps were produced mainly by the earth occultation of the source , high background regions on the earth , and down - link to the ground stations .",
    "x - ray flux variations of a factor of 23 are clearly seen in the figure .",
    "we next studied the energy dependence of the flux variations . for this purpose",
    ", we calculated the ratios of the time - resolved energy spectra to the average energy spectrum .",
    "considering the statistics of the data and the amplitude of the time variations , the time - resolved energy spectra were calculated every @xmath15  s and six spectra were obtained in total .",
    "we also calculated the average spectra for gis and sis , each of which correspond to the average of 6 time - resolved spectra , as shown in figure  [ fig : avespe ] .",
    "the ratios of the six time - resolved spectra to the average spectrum are presented in figure  [ fig : pharatio ] .",
    "large time variations in both the flux and the shape can be seen at 25  kev , while the ratios are almost flat at 0.71.5  kev and 710  kev .",
    "the flat spectral ratios mean that the shape of the energy spectra does not vary at 0.71.5  kev and 710  kev . furthermore , those at 0.71.5  kev are always close to unity",
    "this indicates that the energy spectra change neither their shapes nor the fluxes in this energy range . it should be noted that a local structure is seen just around 6.4  kev and the ratios are closer to unity only in this narrow energy band .",
    "at least three spectral components may be required to reproduce these time variations of the spectral ratios : a stable soft component below @xmath42  kev , a variable hard component above @xmath42  kev , and a relatively stable component around 67  kev . because we are mostly interested in the feature around 67  kev",
    ", we do not discuss the soft stable component hereafter by limiting the energy range in the spectral analyses to above @xmath42  kev .    in order to study the nature of the relatively stable component around 67  kev",
    ", we need to separate the component from the underlying variable hard component .",
    "we first determined the shape of the variable hard component by performing a model fit to the average spectrum at 24  kev and 810  kev after masking the 48  kev range .",
    "the results show that a simple model of a power law with a single absorption can not reproduce the spectrum , and that a `` dual absorber '' model is necessary .",
    "the need for a dual absorber for the asca spectrum was already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the `` dual absorber '' model is expressed by the following formula : @xmath16          + ( 1 - c_{\\rm f } ) \\exp[-\\sigma(e ) n^{2}_{\\rm h } ] \\right\\ } e^{-\\gamma } , \\label{eq : dualabs}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a normalization factor , @xmath18 the photon index , @xmath19 the column density , @xmath20 the photo - electric absorption cross - section , and @xmath21 the source covering fraction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the superscript to @xmath19 indicates two different column densities . in the following analysis ,",
    "the photo - electric absorption cross - sections compiled by @xcite are considered .",
    "the thus - determined continuum spectrum was subtracted from the average spectrum ; the residual feature at 48  kev is shown in figure  [ fig : fe ] .",
    "the presence of a narrow peak at 6.4  kev and a broad feature skewed toward the lower energy can be clearly seen .",
    "we then studied the time variations of the residual feature at around 6.4  kev . for this purpose",
    ", we used the 6 sets of sis spectra , which have a better energy resolution than the gis spectra .",
    "the continuum shape was determined separately for the 6 sets of spectra using the same method for the average spectrum .",
    "we set @xmath23 in equation  ( [ eq : dualabs ] ) to 0 to simplify the model fitting , considering the statistics of the data .",
    "we confirmed that setting @xmath23 to zero did not change the continuum shape at 48  kev more than 3% while taking the 4th data set",
    "( those with the largest flux ) as an example .",
    "the model was found to be acceptable for all 6 sets of the spectra with the largest value of @xmath24 .",
    "when the continuum model was interpolated to the 48  kev band , an excess feature could be clearly seen in all 6 sets of the energy spectra .",
    "we show them in figure  [ fig : feindiv ] after subtracting the continuum model from the observed spectra .",
    "a prominent narrow peak at around 6.4  kev , and broad features at 4.56.0  kev ( hereafter referred to as a red wing ) and at 6.87.5  kev ( a blue wing ) are clearly seen in all 6 data sets .    in order to study any profile change of the broad and skewed feature",
    ", we made the ratios of each of the 6 excess features to their average .",
    "the ratios were calculated by dividing the individual excess feature ( after subtracting the interpolated continuum ) by the excess feature in the average spectrum ( figure  [ fig : fe ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : excesspha ] . by performing a @xmath25 test for the hypothesis that the ratios have no energy dependence",
    ", we found that the 6 sets of ratios are consistent with being constant in terms of the energy , and that the time variation of the profile of the broad and skewed feature is not significant . at the same time",
    ", we calculated the flux ratio of the red wing ( 4.56.0  kev ) to the narrow core ( 6.06.8  kev ) and that of the blue wing ( 6.87.5  kev ) to the narrow core for the 6 sets of sis spectra .",
    "no significant time variation was found at the 90% confidence limit in the two sets of ratios ( @xmath26 at most ) .",
    "the standard deviation to the mean for the flux ratio of the red wing to the narrow core was calculated to be 20% at most . although the time variation is not significantly found , a variation of less than 20% in amplitude",
    "is not rejected .",
    "we analyzed the rxte pca data in order to study the spectral variations on a time scale longer than the @xmath12  s covered by asca .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : rxtelc ] the light curve calculated from the pca data obtained from 1999 january 1 through july 24 .",
    "significant flux variations can be clearly seen .",
    "the pca spectrum averaged over the rxte observations is shown in figure  [ fig : rxteave ] .",
    "as was done for the asca spectra , we fit a power law modified by `` dual absorption '' ( @xmath27 ) to the average spectrum in 2.810  kev after masking the 48  kev energy band .",
    "we also checked how it affected the continuum shape to set @xmath23 to zero , and found that there was no noticeable impact if the fit range was restricted to 2.84 and 810 kev .",
    "the ratio of the observed spectrum to the continuum model is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : rxteave ] .",
    "we can clearly see the presence of a broad and skewed feature at 48  kev again .",
    "next , in order to search for the time variations of the broad and skewed feature on time scales longer than @xmath12  s , we divided the data into 11 subsets on a time bin of @xmath28  s and calculated an energy spectrum for each subset of data .",
    "we then fit a power law modified by `` dual absorption '' to the 11 spectra in 2.810  kev while excluding the 48  kev band again .",
    "the fit was acceptable for all of the spectra .",
    "the residuals of the 11 spectra after subtracting the best - fit continuum model are shown in figure  [ fig : rxteindiv ] . a significant excess flux over the continuum model",
    "is always seen at 4.57.5  kev .",
    "the excess has a peak at around 6.06.5  kev as well as a significant tail feature on the lower energy side .",
    "then , we again investigated the time variations of the spectral shape of the excess by comparing the 11 excess spectra with their average .",
    "the spectral ratios of the 11 spectra to their average are shown in figure  [ fig : rxteratio ] .",
    "we performed @xmath25 tests to check whether or not each of the 11 ratio - spectra is consistent with being flat .",
    "a flat model was found to be acceptable for all 11 ratios with @xmath29 , although the flux level of the excess shows a significant variation .",
    "this indicates that , although the excess flux at 4.57.5  kev is variable on a time scale longer than @xmath28  s , the profile does not change significantly .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the time variability of the flux and the profile of the broad and skewed feature consisting of a narrow peak at 6.4  kev and red / blue wings in a way fairly independent of any spectral models . in this section ,",
    "we introduce two different model functions to reproduce the profile : one is the so - called `` disk - line '' model , and the other is a `` reflection '' model .",
    "it is widely accepted that the broad and skewed feature at around 57  kev often seen from agn is composed of gravitationally redshifted iron - fluorescent lines from matter orbiting in an accretion disk very close to the central black hole  @xcite .",
    "hence , we first tried to fit the broad line - like feature observed from ngc  4151 with the disk - line model .",
    "we adopted a spectrum described by equation  ( [ eq : dualabs ] ) as the continuum , where @xmath30 was set to 0 to simplify the model .",
    "the outer and inner radii of the accretion disk were set to 1000  @xmath31 and 10  @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath31 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the emissivity of the line emission is assumed to have a power - law dependence on the radius with the index of @xmath322 @xcite .",
    "the model fitting was carried out in the energy range of 2.210  kev simultaneously to the sis and gis data for each of the 6 sets of the asca energy spectra .",
    "the photon index was fixed to 1.55 , which was the average value when we fit a power law with a partial covering absorber to the spectra after masking 48  kev .",
    "the model was found to be acceptable for all of the spectra at 2.210.0  kev with @xmath33 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : ascapar ] .",
    "the inclination angles and the line center energies obtained from the spectral fits to the 6 spectra are not significantly different from one another .",
    "the reduced @xmath25 values for the hypothesis that the 6 values are constant were 1.35 and 0.89 for 5 d.o.f .  for the inclination angle and the line center energy , respectively .",
    "this means that these two parameters are consistent with being constant . the average inclination angle and the line center energy are @xmath34 and @xmath35  kev , respectively .",
    "we applied the same model to the 11 energy spectra of pca at 2.824  kev .",
    "however , the fit was not acceptable with @xmath36 .",
    "the deviation of the model from the observed spectra became noticeable above 16  kev .",
    "hence , we replaced the power law in equation  ( [ eq : dualabs ] ) with a broken power law as described below : @xmath37 where @xmath17 is a normalization , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are photon indices , and @xmath40 is a break energy at which the spectral index changes .",
    "note that the broken power - law is required due to the apparent change in the spectral slope above @xmath416  kev , not because we set @xmath30 to zero .",
    "the 11 energy spectra of pca were all reproduced by the new model with @xmath41 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : rxtepar ] .",
    "we checked the time variation of the 11 values of each parameter by performing a @xmath25 test .",
    "the photon indices , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and the break energy , @xmath40 , are found to have not changed significantly during the observational period .",
    "we cross - checked the spectral slope above the break energy , which was found to be @xmath42 , using the data from another detector hexte ( high energy x - ray timing experiment ) on board rxte .",
    "hexte consists of two clusters of 4 nai / csi phoswich scintillation detectors sensitive to x - rays from 15 to 250  kev .",
    "the photon indices obtained from a simultaneous fit of a power - law model to the 11 sets of the pca spectrum ( 1824  kev ) and hexte spectrum ( 18100  kev ) are found to fall around @xmath43 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath44 .",
    "it is noteworthy that , although the disk line model can always reproduce the excess feature around 57  kev , the continuum spectrum needs a break at around 17  kev to reproduce the energy spectrum up to 100  kev .      in the disk - line model , the peak at 6.4  kev",
    "is considered to be a blue part of fluorescent lines coming from matter orbiting in an accretion disk very close to the central black hole .",
    "however , the peak energy is just the k@xmath45 line of a neutral , or a lowly ionized iron , in the rest frame ; furthermore , the profile around the peak can be reproduced by a single narrow line .",
    "hence , it would be more natural to consider that the peak at 6.4  kev is a single fluorescent iron line coming from a region free from relativistic effects .",
    "if the line is emitted through the fluorescent process as a result of x - ray illumination on relatively cold matter far outside the central x - ray source , x - ray reflection at the surface of the matter should take place simultaneously with the fluorescent line emission .",
    "the x - rays reflected by the cold matter emitting the fluorescent lines could be a possible origin of the broad red and blue wings accompanied by the narrow line feature on both sides .",
    "because x - ray reflection is due to thomson scattering , the reflected x - rays should have the same spectrum as the illuminating x - rays in a typical x - ray band , but suffer from absorption when they pass through the cold mater .",
    "thus , the reflected component may be approximated by applying cold - matter absorption to the continuum model .    in order to test this possibility , we introduced the following model spectrum : @xmath46 + 1-c_{\\rm f}^1\\ } \\exp[-\\sigma(e )                    n_{\\rm h}^2 ]                     + i(e_{\\rm line } )   + c_{\\rm f}^2 p(e,\\gamma )                     \\exp[-\\sigma(e ) n_{\\rm h}^3 ] .",
    "\\label{eq : ref}\\ ] ] here , the first term is the same as equation  ( [ eq : dualabs ] ) , representing continuum x - rays directly coming from the central x - ray source .",
    "the second term represents the fluorescent iron line at 6.4  kev and @xmath47 is a gaussian function . the line width is assumed to be zero .",
    "the third term is for the reflection component .",
    "the efficiency of the x - ray reflection is represented by @xmath48 , which corresponds to a covering fraction of the x - ray reflector optically thick for thomson scattering .",
    "the function , @xmath49 , is a power law with a photon index of @xmath18 .",
    "the photon index is optimized in the course of the fitting , because it may be affected by the introduction of a highly absorbed component .",
    "the column densities and covering fractions are also optimized .",
    "model fitting was firstly carried out to the 11 pca spectra in the energy range of 2.824  kev . in this energy range , because the effect of absorption by @xmath30 was negligible , we omitted this term .",
    "the fit was acceptable for all energy spectra with @xmath50 .",
    "an example of the results of the model fitting is shown in figure  [ fig : rxteref ] and the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : rxteref ] .",
    "the results show that 4050% of the direct flux is reflected .",
    "we checked the constancy of the 11 values of each spectral parameter with a @xmath25 test .",
    "we found that the photon index and the absorption column of the reflected component , @xmath51 , are both consistent with being constant ( @xmath52 , and 1.25/10 , respectively ) .",
    "we confirmed that the profile of the broad and skewed feature did not change significantly during the rxte observations .",
    "the weighted mean of the 11 photon indices is @xmath53 .",
    "this is comparable to @xmath54 , which we obtained from a simultaneous fitting to the 11 sets of the pca energy spectra at 1824  kev and the hexte energy spectra at 18100  kev .",
    "if we extrapolate the best - fit model at 2.824  kev to 100  kev , no significant discrepancy is recognized between the model and the observed energy spectra with hexte .",
    "this indicates that the intrinsic spectrum emitted from the central source should be a single power law with an index of @xmath41.9 , and should extend up to 100  kev without a break , if the `` reflection '' model explains the broad and skewed feature at around 57  kev .",
    "although the best - fit line energies are found to be consistent with being constant , the mean line center energy is @xmath55  kev .",
    "this is slightly lower than the center energy of the iron fluorescent line from neutral matter ( 6.4  kev ) .",
    "however , it is known that there is a systematic uncertainty of about 23% in the energy scale of the rxte instrument .",
    "thus , the line energy can still be interpreted as the iron fluorescent line .",
    "the time variation of the line flux is shown together with that of the continuum flux at 810  kev in figure  [ fig : rxtefe ] .",
    "the time variation of the line flux is clearly seen in a time scale of @xmath56@xmath57  s.    next , we also applied the model function ( equation  [ eq : ref ] ) to the asca data . because the energy range of the asca detectors is limited below 10  kev , some of the model parameters were not well constrained .",
    "hence , we fixed the following parameters in the fitting : @xmath18 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath51 ( @xmath59 atom  @xmath60 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath61  % ) .",
    "other parameters were optimized during the course of fitting .",
    "the model fitting was carried out to each of the 6 sets of the asca data , simultaneously to the sis and gis spectra .",
    "fittings of this model were all acceptable with @xmath62 .",
    "an example of the results of the model fittings to the asca sis spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : ascaref ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : ascaref ] .",
    "the time histories of the line flux and the continuum flux at 810  kev for the asca data are plotted in figure  [ fig : ascalcfe ] .",
    "no significant change of the line flux can be seen on time scales of @xmath63@xmath56  s. as can be seen from the table , the values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath30 obtained from the spectral fits to the 6 sets of asca spectra significantly change on time scales of @xmath63@xmath56  s. the relative amplitude of the variations of @xmath64 and @xmath30 are @xmath420% and @xmath412% , respectively .    finally , we investigated the parameters of the narrow line component .",
    "we optimized the center energy and the intrinsic width of the narrow line component in the `` reflection '' model by fitting it to the average spectra of the asca observations in 2000 .",
    "the line center energy and the intrinsic width were found to be @xmath66  kev and less than 92  ev ( gaussian @xmath67 ) , respectively .",
    "an analysis of the time - resolved energy spectra showed that the iron line flux was consistent with being constant on time scales of @xmath63@xmath56  s , while significant variations were seen in its flux on time scales of @xmath56@xmath57  s. in order to study the origin of the line emission , the relation between the continuum flux and the line flux was studied . here , the continuum flux was calculated in the energy band of 810  kev , which is higher than the k edge energy of neutral iron . in this energy range",
    ", the flux variation should reflect the variation of the intrinsic , power - law component .    because the line emission probably results from a reprocessing of the continuum x - rays by matter ambient to the continuum source , the light curve of the line flux might suffer from some amount of smearing and/or time delay to the continuum flux light curve .",
    "in fact , if we compare the light curves of the continuum flux and the line flux ( figure  [ fig : rxtefe ] ) , the line flux variation seems to follow the smeared variations of the continuum flux . in order to see the effect of smearing , we applied smearing to the continuum light curve using a following simple method .",
    "we redistributed the continuum flux of @xmath68-th time bin into @xmath69 bins starting from @xmath68-th bin .",
    "thus , the smeared light curve is expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the flux of @xmath68-th bin in the original light curve , @xmath72 the flux of @xmath68-th bin in the smeared light curve , and @xmath69 the number of bins to smear .",
    "we then fitted the smeared light curve to the line flux light curve .",
    "we increased @xmath69 from 1 until we obtain an acceptable fit .",
    "note that @xmath73 corresponds to the case without smearing .",
    "the relation between @xmath69 and @xmath74 is plotted in figure  [ fig : rxtesmear ] .",
    "we could obtain an acceptable agreement with @xmath75 between the smeared light curve of the continuum flux and the line flux light curve .",
    "the smeared light curve in the case of @xmath75 is compared with the light curve of the line flux in figure  [ fig : rxtesmcomp ] .",
    "the above - mentioned smearing algorithm of the continuum flux also introduces a delay of @xmath76 bins together with smearing of @xmath76 bins to both sides .",
    "thus the typical delay and smearing time scale may be regarded as @xmath77  s.    we then checked whether or not smearing of @xmath78  s can explain the absence of a correlation between the continuum flux and the line flux on shorter time scales for the asca data . since the asca data is shorter than @xmath78  s , we could not smear the continuum flux light curve directly .",
    "hence , we assumed that the observed light curve of the continuum flux in the asca observations repeats periodically .",
    "we then smeared the assumed light curve using the method described above . the fractional variation (",
    "i.e.  standard deviation divided by the average ) of the continuum flux was originally @xmath40.25 , but was reduced to @xmath40.06 by smearing .",
    "the reduced value is consistent with the observed upper limit , 7% , of the fractional variation of the line flux in the asca observations .",
    "we analyzed the asca data obtained in 2000 may which covered time intervals of @xmath79  s. the data were divided into 6 sets with an integration time of @xmath80  s each to study the time variabilities of the spectrum . in order to analyze the excess component separately from the continuum",
    ", we masked a range of 48  kev in spectral fitting and determined the continuum model .",
    "we found that a power law with a photon index of @xmath41.55 modified by two absorbers with different column densities and covering fractions can smoothly connect the two spectral parts at 24  kev and 810  kev . above this continuum , an excess",
    "is clearly detected in 4.57.5  kev , which has a broad and skewed feature .",
    "the feature has a prominent narrow peak at 6.4  kev , but accompanies a broad red wing at 4.56.0  kev and a blue wing at 6.87.5  kev .",
    "the flux and shape of the excess feature obtained from each of the 6 spectra were compared with one another .",
    "it is found that the excess flux is consistent with being stable , concerning both the flux and the spectral shape , over the observations of @xmath79  s.    we also analyzed data obtained by rxte from january through july in 1999 in order to search for any time variations of the iron line on a time scale of @xmath81  s. we obtained 11 sets of time - resolved energy spectra , each of which covers a time interval of @xmath82  s. if we selected only the energy bands free from the iron structures , i.e.  the 2.84.0  kev and 810  kev bands , each energy spectrum could be reproduced again by a power law with a photon index of @xmath41.5 modified by the partial covering absorption . this result is consistent with that of asca . in 4.57.5",
    "kev , an excess flux over the continuum is clearly seen as a broad feature , in which significant flux variations are detected .",
    "however , no clear change was noticed in its profile .",
    "the absence of a profile change in spite of the significant flux variations in the broad and skewed feature strongly indicates that the feature is produced through a single mechanism .",
    "we studied the time scale of the flux variations of the narrow line .",
    "it was found that the flux variations are not significant on time scales of @xmath63@xmath56  s , whereas they become significant on time scales of @xmath56@xmath57  s. we also studied whether or not an introduction of a smearing effect can improve the correlation between the line flux and the continuum flux .",
    "we redistributed the continuum flux light curve with a simple method approximating a smear and delay .",
    "we found that the agreement between the line flux light curve and the smeared light curve of the continuum flux becomes acceptable when we introduce a smear and a delay on a time scale of @xmath77  s. these results concerning the line flux variations and the effect of a smear strongly suggest that the line emitting region should have a size extent of 10@xmath83  cm .",
    "we further studied the time scale of the variation in the absorption column density .",
    "a column density of the order of @xmath84 atom  @xmath60 is necessary to reproduce the continuum spectrum , and is found to vary significantly on a time scale of @xmath63@xmath56  s with a relative amplitude of @xmath420% . taking account of the relative amplitude of the variation ,",
    "the size of the absorber is indicated to be no larger than @xmath1  cm , which is just the size of the line emitting region .",
    "the absorber should be around , or inside , the line emitting region .",
    "we tried a continuum plus a disk - line model to reproduce the energy spectra , and found that this model can reproduce the energy spectra at 210  kev for both asca and rxte data .",
    "as a result of the previous discussion , the size of the line emitting region should be as large as @xmath1  cm . in the disk - line model",
    ", the line is assumed to be emitted from a region with a size of several to ten times the schwarzschild radius .",
    "if the size of @xmath1  cm deduced from observational results corresponds to several to ten - times the schwarzschild radius , we need to assume a central mass close to @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "this central mass is not consistent with @xmath57  @xmath3 estimated for ngc  4151 from various methods , e.g.  x - ray variability time scale @xcite and the analysis of the high ionization lines in the broad line region @xcite .",
    "this mass is rather close to the typical mass of a galaxy , and would be too large as the mass of the central black hole",
    ".    the presence of the absorber around or inside the line emitting region would also be difficult to explain in the context of the `` disk - line '' model .",
    "if the line emitting region has a size of several to ten - times the schwarzschild radius , the absorber should necessarily be located at a region very close to the central black hole .",
    "this may not be consistent with the unified scheme in which the heavy absorption as seen in ngc  4151 is considered to be due to a dusty torus around the central active region .",
    "we obtain an inclination angle of the disk to be @xmath85 . this inclination angle is smaller than the generally accepted value @xmath86 , which is supported by the chandra observation @xcite and the optical observations .",
    "this is also a disadvantage of the `` disk - line '' model .    as discussed above ,",
    "there exist some serious difficulties in the disk - line model , which are not consistent with a reasonable , common picture of agn , although we can not completely exclude its possibility .",
    "we consider here an alternative explanation for the origin of the broad and skewed profile , in which the narrow peak at 6.4  kev should be a narrow line and the red and blue wings should be a part of the continuum .",
    "however , according to the constant profile of the broad feature around 57  kev , the narrow line and the continuum should have a strong physical connection .",
    "the line energy at 6.4  kev strongly suggests that the line is the fluorescent k - line from neutral or low ionization iron .",
    "if the line is really emitted through a fluorescent process , it implies that some amount of matter exists in the vicinity of the x - ray source .",
    "this matter should be irradiated by x - rays from the x - ray source and the fluorescent lines should be emitted there . if this is the case , continuum x - rays should also be emitted from the matter through electron scattering of irradiating x - rays .",
    "this reflected component should be observed together with the fluorescent line , and could be the red and blue wings .",
    "when an x - ray from the source is absorbed by an iron atom in the x - ray reflector through photo - ionization of a k - electron , a fluorescent k - line is emitted with a certain probability called a fluorescent yield . on the other hand ,",
    "when an x - ray from the source hits an electron in the reflector , it could be re - emitted towards us through thomson ( compton ) scattering .",
    "the cross section of thomson scattering is about @xmath87  @xmath88 .",
    "hence , if the column density of the x - ray reflector is sufficiently large , an x - ray penetrated into the reflector would , on average , experiences photo - electric absorption by matter with a column density of about @xmath89  @xmath60 before being scattered by an electron . as a result ,",
    "x - rays reflected by sufficiently thick matter should have a spectrum with a continuum shape being the same as the intrinsic x - rays , but suffering from photo - electric absorption by matter with a column density of about @xmath89  @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the broad and skewed feature can be reproduced by a model consisting of a narrow line at 6.4  kev , and a power law with the same slope as the remaining continuum and with a photo - electric absorption by a column of @xmath89  @xmath60 .",
    "the equivalent width of the 6.4  kev line with respect to the heavily absorbed component is about 2  kev .",
    "this is roughly consistent with a value expected from a case when the heavily absorbed component is just the reflected component ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if we adopt the above model for the broad and skewed feature around 4.58  kev , the total spectrum becomes to have three differently absorbed components with the same continuum shape .",
    "the absorption column densities are about @xmath90  @xmath60 , ( 12)@xmath91  @xmath60 , and about @xmath89  @xmath60 . among the three components ,",
    "two components absorbed by smaller columns are found to be variable on a time scale of @xmath63@xmath56  s , whereas the component with the absorption by @xmath92  @xmath60 was steady on that time scale .",
    "this strongly suggests that the heavily absorbed component has a different origin from the other two components .",
    "the time variability of the heavily absorbed component is rather similar to that of the fluorescent iron line .",
    "this indicates a strong physical coupling between the fluorescent iron line and the heavily absorbed component , and strongly supports the idea that the heavily absorbed component is a reflected emission by cold matter which is also responsible for the fluorescent iron line .",
    "the above model fits both the asca spectra at 210  kev and the rxte spectra at 224  kev well .",
    "the model can also fit the data in a higher energy range . actually ,",
    "if we extrapolate the best - fit model in the energy range of 2.824  kev to 100  kev , no significant discrepancy is recognized between the model and the observed energy spectra .",
    "therefore , this model can explain wider range of energy spectra without the spectral break than the model based on the disk - line .",
    "if the reflection is really at work , the covering fraction of the absorber may be related to the solid angle of the reflector , @xmath93 , subtending to the x - ray source .",
    "the covering fraction that we obtained for an absorber of @xmath89  @xmath60 is @xmath94 , which corresponds to @xmath95 .",
    "the reflection structure was detected in the energy spectra of ngc  4151 with the ginga / osse data @xcite and the bepposax data @xcite .",
    "the bepposax data indicated that the relative contribution of the reflection changed with time .",
    "the covering fraction of the reflector so far reported ranges over @xmath96 @xcite . the covering fraction which we obtained is slightly larger than this range , but is not very different , if we consider the different modeling of the reflection component .",
    "based on the reflection model , we may be able to constrain the mass of the central black hole using the iron line parameters . from the model fitting",
    ", we found that the iron line is consistent with having no intrinsic width , and its upper limit is 92 ev .",
    "we also found that the iron line emitting region has a size of @xmath1  cm .",
    "it may be natural to assume that the line emission region is located around the central black hole and is rotating at the kepler velocity around the black hole .",
    "then , the line width may be determined by the doppler effect ; the upper limit of the line width can be related to the upper limit of the kepler velocity as @xmath97 .",
    "this may be converted to the mass of the black hole using the relation @xmath98 , which yields the upper limit of the black hole mass , @xmath99  @xmath100 . here , we assume @xmath101  cm .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated mass of @xmath57  @xmath100 .",
    "if the mass of the central black hole is @xmath57  @xmath100 , a few times 10@xmath102  cm corresponds to @xmath103  @xmath31 . at this distance , the x - ray reflector should exist .",
    "since the reflected component shows evidence of absorption by a column of @xmath89  @xmath60 , the reflector should be thomson thick .",
    "the solid angle of the reflector , as viewed from the central x - ray source , should be about @xmath104 .",
    "this reflector would be a so - called dust torus , which is generally believed to exist around the central engine in seyfert galaxies .",
    "it has been shown that the continuum spectrum of ngc  4151 needs a partial covering by x - ray absorbers with a column density of ( 12)@xmath91  @xmath60 .",
    "the absorption column and the covering factor have been found to vary on a time scale of @xmath63@xmath56  s. as already discussed above , this leaky absorber should exist around or inside the line emitting region .",
    "if a dusty torus emits the line , a geometrical relation between a dusty torus and a broad line region seems to be consistent with the observed constraint on the geometrical relation between the line emitting region and the leaky absorber .",
    "the absorbers could be relatively cold clouds in the broad line region .",
    "if so , the typical time scale of a change of the leaky absorption should be roughly estimated by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the size of the x - ray emitting region and @xmath107 the velocity of the x - ray absorbing clouds .",
    "since the typical velocity of the broad line clouds is several times @xmath108  cm  s@xmath13 and the typical time scale of the absorption change is a few times @xmath63  s , the size of the emission region may be about @xmath109  cm .",
    "this size corresponds to a few ten - times @xmath31 of a black hole with a mass of @xmath57  @xmath100 , and is consistent with a natural expectation that a region close to the central black hole should be emitting the continuum x - rays .",
