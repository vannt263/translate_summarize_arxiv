    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory underlying strong interactions . however ,",
    "ab initio calculations of hadronic and nuclear properties remain one of the largest theoretical challenges of the standard model .",
    "lattice simulations provide a numerical approach , but do at present not usually operate at the physical point  ( for reviews on the lattice simulations of light nuclei see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in a complementary approach , effective field theories ( eft ) describe the effective degrees of nuclear physics , namely nucleons and pions , and allow for accurate calculations of low - energy observables with a direct link to qcd through the symmetries of the theory , see e.g.  @xcite .    in lattice simulations ,",
    "the qcd path integral is evaluated in a discretized euclidean space - time using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "this approach requires a large numerical effort , which in turn strongly constrains the parameters of the simulation .",
    "in particular , the considered system is necessarily placed in a finite volume .",
    "present day calculations use cubic boxes with periodic boundary conditions and relatively small side lengths of a few  fm .",
    "momentum quantization due to the boundary conditions causes a shift of the finite - volume spectrum relative to the infinite - volume energies  @xcite .",
    "a model - independent determination of this shift is necessary in order to extract physical observables from lattice results .",
    "calculations at large volumes are possible , but rendered inefficient by the enormous numerical effort necessary .",
    "therefore , the use of well - known physics to perform the extrapolation is warranted .",
    "the volume dependence of the spectrum also provides access to scattering parameters .",
    "most prominently , lscher showed that infinite volume scattering phase shifts as well as resonance properties are encoded in the finite - volume spectrum of two - particle states  @xcite .",
    "the correlation function for the three - nucleon system in the triton channel has been calculated in lattice qcd recently  @xcite , but because of the relatively large uncertainties no triton properties could be extracted . with quantitative lattice data on light nuclei and their scattering properties within reach ,",
    "lscher s results need to be extended to the three - body sector in order to understand the finite volume effects in these results .",
    "the desired incorporation of well - known physics , combined with the demand of model independence and the ability to achieve a given level of accuracy , are preconditions well met by the eft approach . in the nuclear sector , the pionless eft , which is valid for processes with typical momenta below the pion mass , has been successfully used to describe the properties of light nuclei  ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) . to leading order ,",
    "the three - body sector is described by the nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels and a wigner su(4 ) symmetric three - body force  @xcite .",
    "the pionless eft in the nucleonic sector can be seen as part of a larger family of efts for systems with resonant two - body interactions .",
    "they are characterized by the appearance of a two - body scattering length  @xmath2 that is unnaturally large compared to the range of interaction .",
    "such systems display interesting universal properties .",
    "if  @xmath2 is positive , two particles of mass  @xmath0 form a shallow two - body bound state with binding energy  @xmath9 , independent of the detailed mechanism generating the large scattering length .",
    "for example , @xmath10he atoms have the unnaturally large scattering length 189  @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the bohr radius .",
    "using the aforementioned relation to extract @xmath2 from the energy of the helium dimer , on the other hand , yields a scattering length of 182  @xmath11 , deviating by only 3.7% . in the pionless eft , the shallow two - body bound state is identified as the deuteron .    in the three - body system ,",
    "the universal properties include the efimov effect  @xcite .",
    "if at least two of the three particles have a scattering length  @xmath12 that is large compared to the range of their interaction , a sequence of three - body bound states exists . in the limit of diverging scattering length , there are infinitely many geometrically spaced bound states with an accumulation point at threshold .",
    "this spectrum is the signature of the efimov effect , namely a discrete scaling symmetry whose consequences can be calculated in an eft for short - range interactions . here",
    ", it appears because the renormalization group flow of the three - body coupling is a limit cycle  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this is the case for the wigner su(4 ) symmetric three - body force in pionless eft  @xcite , but also for the three - body force needed to renormalize the simpler eft of three identical bosons  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will therefore study systems of three identical bosons inside a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions using the eft framework . transferring the methods developed in this publication to the pionless eft",
    "will give an understanding of the finite volume corrections in lattice calculations of the three - nucleon system .",
    "in this paper , we study the volume dependence of three - boson states below the three - body break - up threshold inside a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one of the authors performed similar studies before  @xcite .",
    "we developed the new framework presented in this paper for several reasons .",
    "first , the new approach provides access to the energy region above the boson - diboson break - up threshold .",
    "second , it does not rely on the use of basis functions but remains in close contact with the discrete space of allowed momenta .",
    "it further allows for a faster numerical implementation when higher partial waves are taken into account .",
    "thus , for the first time , we are able to study the size of these higher partial wave contributions in a systematic manner as well as how they can be included perturbatively .",
    "the application of eft to finite volumes , especially for three - particle systems , has sparked interest in recent years .",
    "the volume dependence for three spin-1/2 fermions with perturbative interactions in a box has been studied previously  @xcite .",
    "epelbaum and collaborators have calculated the energy of the triton in a finite volume by implementing a discretized version of chiral eft on a lattice  @xcite .",
    "also , the triton has been considered in pionless eft in a nuclear lattice formalism but the volume dependence was not investigated @xcite .",
    "other volume shapes have also been studied , most prominently the harmonic oscillator  @xcite , which allows to compute finite volume effects inside atomic traps .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the basic equations and sketch the ideas of our numerical implementation .",
    "we furthermore present two different approaches to include higher partial wave corrections perturbatively . in section  [ results ] , we provide a detailed discussion of our numerical results , including a study on the perturbative nature of higher partial waves .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes our findings and provides an outlook for future work .",
    "in the following , we derive a set of coupled equations governing the partial waves of the amplitude and explain how to prepare these equations for a numerical implementation . in the last part of this section ,",
    "we show two ways to take higher partial waves into account perturbatively .      the lagrangian for three identical bosons interacting via short - range forces can be written as  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath13 where the dots indicate higher order terms of the effective theory .",
    "the lagrangian is formulated in terms of the boson field  @xmath14 and a non - dynamical auxiliary field  @xmath15 with the quantum numbers of two bosons .",
    "units have been chosen such that @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the mass of a single boson .",
    "the system of three bosons is assumed to be contained in a cubic box with side length  @xmath1 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to quantized momenta  @xmath17 , @xmath18 . as a consequence ,",
    "the loop integrations of the infinite volume case are replaced by sums .",
    "if loop sums are divergent , they are regulated by a cutoff  @xmath19 similar to the infinite volume case .",
    "while the finite volume modifies the infrared regime of the theory by introducing the low - momentum scale  @xmath20 , the ultraviolet behavior does not change .",
    "therefore , its renormalization is the same in the finite and infinite volume cases .",
    "of course , this statement is only valid as long as the infrared and ultraviolet regime of the theory characterized by the scales  @xmath20 and  @xmath19 , respectively , are well separated , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we will explicitly demonstrate that the numerical results in this publication are indeed renormalized .",
    "the cutoff dependence in the two - body sector can be removed completely by matching the coupling constant  @xmath22 to a low - energy two - body observable , namely the two - body scattering length  @xmath2 or , if applicable , the two - body binding energy .",
    "as the cutoff is increased , the three - body coupling approaches a renormalization group limit cycle , leading to a log - periodic dependence of the coupling constant  @xmath23 on the cutoff  @xmath19 . for convenience ,",
    "@xmath23 is often expressed in terms of a dimensionless function  @xmath24 via @xmath25 .",
    "the phase of the log - periodic dependence of  @xmath24 has to be fixed from a three - body datum  @xcite .",
    "the central quantity in the three - body sector is the boson - diboson amplitude .",
    "the derivation of the equation governing this object in finite volume has been shown in detail in a previous publication  @xcite and is therefore only briefly sketched in the following .",
    "a discussion of the infinite - volume case can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "starting point for both cases is the lippmann - schwinger equation for the boson - diboson amplitude . in a finite volume",
    ", there is no continuous scattering spectrum , but only discrete energy levels .",
    "the analytic structure of the amplitude is given by a number of simple poles at the energies of these discrete states , just like the analytic structure of bound states in the infinite volume .",
    "in addition , the incoming and outgoing quantum numbers separate .",
    "the residue at the pole is the amplitude  @xmath26 .",
    "comparing the residues of both sides of the lippmann - schwinger equation at any of the discrete energy levels yields the homogeneous equation depicted diagrammatically in figure  [ fig : inteq ] .    in the center of mass frame ,",
    "the momenta of the outgoing single boson and diboson are  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the outgoing single boson is taken to be on - shell , giving the four - momentum  @xmath29 .",
    "the four - momentum of the outgoing diboson line is  @xmath30 , making the total kinetic energy  @xmath31 a parameter of the equation .",
    "the equation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : inteq ] then serves as a consistency condition .",
    "values of the energy parameter  @xmath31 for which the equation has a solution are identified as the energies of the discrete finite volume spectrum .    using the kinematics outlined above , the sum equation for the boson - diboson amplitude  @xmath26 reads @xmath32 the quantity @xmath33 contains the interaction kernel of the sum equation , while @xmath34 is essentially the diboson propagator inside the loop .    for the diboson lines in the three - body equation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : inteq ] , the interacting diboson propagator has to be used .",
    "this quantity is obtained by dressing the bare propagator , which is a constant , with bosonic loops ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the sum equation",
    ", it appears via the quantity  @xcite @xmath35 which is identical to the full propagator up to a prefactor .",
    "the absolute value of the integer three - vector  @xmath36 is denoted  @xmath37 . in the limit @xmath38",
    ", the propagator reduces to the infinite volume expression .",
    "the interaction kernel is given by the one - boson exchange term and the boson - diboson contact interaction .",
    "since the time direction is considered to be of infinite extent , the integration over the loop energy remains continuous and can be performed analytically by using the residue theorem .",
    "the resulting interaction kernel depends only on incoming and outgoing three - momenta as well as the total energy : @xmath39\\ ] ]    in the present calculation , only energies below the threshold for the break - up into three individual bosons , i.e. @xmath40 , are considered .",
    "this keeps the investigated states below any inelastic thresholds , in particular the @xmath41 threshold .",
    "the amplitude  @xmath26 is strictly speaking only defined for the discrete momenta inside the box .",
    "one ansatz for the solution of the sum equation   is therefore to use the quantized momenta themselves as sampling points . in this approach ,",
    "the value of the amplitude at the sampling points is written as @xmath42 , where the index @xmath43 labels all momenta @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "this yields the finite - dimensional eigenvalue equation @xmath46 f_j\\ ] ] the range of box side lengths that allow for the use of this ansatz is limited .",
    "the number of points to consider roughly scales as @xmath47 , while the complexity of the necessary matrix diagonalization scales like the number of points to the third power .",
    "we will therefore only show results for @xmath48 in this publication .",
    "another drawback of this approach is that it is cumbersome to disentangle the contribution of different partial waves to the finite volume spectrum .",
    "we will refer to this ansatz as the _ grid approach_.    the momentum quantization inside a finite volume is tantamount to a reduction of the spherical symmetry of the infinite volume to a discrete symmetry , namely in our case the point symmetry of the cube . in the language of group theory ,",
    "the infinitely many irreducible representations of the rotational group  so(3 ) become reducible in terms of the five irreducible representations of the cubic group  @xmath49 .",
    "hence , a quantity  @xmath50 transforming according to the irreducible representation  @xmath51 of  @xmath49 can be written in terms of the basis functions of spherical symmetry , i.e. spherical harmonics  @xmath52 , via @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the unit vector in @xmath27-direction and  @xmath55 is the radial function .",
    "the index  @xmath56 is needed if the representation labeled by  @xmath57 appears in the irreducible representation  @xmath51 more than once .",
    "the coefficients  @xmath58 are real and normalized for given values of @xmath51 , @xmath57 and @xmath56 via @xmath59 ^ 2 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the linear combinations  @xmath60 of spherical harmonics are called `` kubic harmonics '' ( sic ! )  @xcite .",
    "the values of the coefficients  @xmath58 are known for  @xmath57 as large as  12  @xcite and are readily computed from group theory  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to amplitudes  @xmath26 transforming under the trivial ( @xmath61 ) representation of the cubic group , because it contains the trivial representation of spherical symmetry , namely @xmath62 .",
    "this is because the investigated efimov states are s - wave states in the infinite volume .",
    "in addition , @xmath61 receives contributions from @xmath63 since all @xmath57-values appear only once below @xmath64 , the index  @xmath56 is dropped in the following .",
    "the coefficients  @xmath65 for @xmath66 are summarized in table  [ tab : clm ] together with the resulting kubic harmonics in cartesian coordinates , normalized to @xmath67 .",
    ".coefficients @xmath68 of the kubic harmonics  @xcite as well as @xmath69 in cartesian coordinates  @xcite for @xmath66 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to see that this is indeed the case , we summarize the finite volume shifts at @xmath6 calculated using the grid approach for all four states and the two investigated cutoffs table  [ tab : leqa ] .",
    "the results for the two cutoffs agree with each other , again showing that the finite volume results are renormalized . comparing the shifts , we notice that state  a is shifted by 45% , while the more shallow and , therefore , larger state  b is already shifted by 137% . for all states except the deepest state  a the relative deviation from the infinite volume energy exceeds 100% .",
    "it is even larger than 400% for the shallowest state  d. the shift at @xmath6 is strongly dependent on the size of the state in the infinite volume , and therefore on the infinite volume energy .",
    "thus , a given finite volume affects a shallow state with a large spatial extent more than smaller , more deeply bound state , as expected .    the volume dependence of the three - body energy as shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : voldep ] seems identical for the three plotted approaches . however , there are small differences between the different runs .",
    "we use the exact result from the grid approach as a baseline and also present the differences @xmath70 in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : voldep ] . here",
    ", @xmath71 can be any of the four runs employing the sum approach .",
    "namely , these are the s - wave only calculation , the full calculation including the g - wave and the two perturbative approaches .",
    "the differences to the respective baseline appear cutoff independent .",
    "some variation is visible in the strictly perturbative treatment , but it is within the uncertainty from the finiteness of the cutoff which is of the order @xmath72 .    the full results with and without the g - wave as well as the partially resummed results are always larger than the grid results .",
    "the s - wave only result in general deviates from the grid result by more than 0.001@xmath73 .",
    "the inclusion of the g - wave consistently reduces the difference to the full grid result by about two orders of magnitude . in other words ,",
    "the inclusion of higher partial waves lowers the energy of the investigated state .    for the very deeply bound state  a",
    ", the difference between the respective sum approach runs and the grid approach does only weakly depend on the volume . for volumes with side lengths",
    "larger than @xmath74 , state  b shows the same qualitative behavior .",
    "below @xmath75 , the difference between the sum approach and the grid approach becomes larger , but is still very small compared to the energy of the state itself .",
    "this can be understood as higher partial waves with @xmath76 having a larger and larger contribution . in addition , the absolute size of the g - wave contribution strongly increases , as expected , when going to smaller volumes .    turning to state  c",
    ", we observe a behavior similar to that of state  b. the strong increase in the spread between the sum approach runs and the grid approach as well as in the size of the g - wave contribution starts at a larger volume , namely around @xmath77 .",
    "this reflects the larger spatial extent of the more shallowly bound state  c compared to state  b. the differences of the sum approach to the grid results grow by two orders of magnitude within the investigated volume range . for the full result ,",
    "for example , the difference increases from @xmath78@xmath73 at @xmath6 to 0.004@xmath73 at @xmath79 . for the very shallow state  d ,",
    "we observe a strong increase of the differences when going towards smaller volumes .",
    "they also grow by two orders of magnitude , albeit over a much smaller volume range .",
    "the difference of the full result at @xmath6 is @xmath80@xmath73 , about twice as large as for state c. it has grown by two orders of magnitude to 0.004@xmath73 already at @xmath81 .",
    "the size of the higher partial wave contributions is comparable to the uncertainty due to the finiteness of the cutoff , which is of order @xmath72 .",
    "this should change when including higher orders of the eft .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections are governed by the effective range @xmath82 and are of the order @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a typical momentum .",
    "their inclusion will be part of the extension of this framework to the three - nucleon system .",
    "overall , the g - wave and higher corrections are indeed small compared to the s - wave energies , justifying their perturbative treatment . in particular",
    ", the partial resummation approach captures the g - wave corrections almost completely .",
    "more than 99% of the shift from the s - wave result to the full result are accounted for using this approach .    for sufficiently large box sizes , states  c and  d",
    "show a different volume dependence than the more deeply bound states ( bottom left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : voldep ] ) . for both states , we find energies above the two - body energy depicted by the dashed line . for state  c ,",
    "this is the case for the smallest investigated volume @xmath79 only .",
    "the data points for @xmath86 suggest a flattening out of the volume dependence , allowing the two - body energy to catch up when further decreasing the box size .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the volume dependence of state  d. at @xmath77 , the two- and three - body energy in the finite volume are equal . for smaller volumes ,",
    "the three - body state is found above the two - body state .",
    "decreasing the volume further increases the energy of the state , until it reaches the three - body breakup threshold @xmath87 for a volume with side length @xmath81 .",
    "we also observed this behavior in the framework developed earlier  @xcite .",
    "our interpretation is that , as the two - body energy reaches the three - body energy , the state behaves like a boson - diboson scattering state when further shrinking the volume .",
    "indeed , the data points above the threshold are compatible with a power - law behavior that is known to describe two - body scattering .",
    "note , however , that we are not in the lscher limit @xmath88 and therefore do not expect a leading @xmath89 behavior  @xcite .",
    "the presence of three - body effects in the volume dependence of such a state will be the subject of further study .",
    "it was recently shown that , in this case , a topological phase is to be expected  @xcite .",
    "the volume size at which this crossing happens is again tied to the infinite volume energy .",
    "state d has a smaller infinite volume binding energy , and therefore a larger spatial extent .",
    "thus , the box which is not able to hold the complete three - body bound state is larger than for the smaller state  c.    turning back to the differences shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : voldep ] , we note that the volume dependence of the higher partial wave contributions does not show any distinctive features at the crossover box sizes .        in the following ,",
    "we compare the poisson approach from refs .",
    "@xcite to the approaches developed in the present paper .",
    "the values for the poisson and sum approach in fig .",
    "[ fig : poisson ] have been obtained by truncating the partial wave expansion of the angular dependence at @xmath62 .",
    "we observe a visible spread between the sum approach and the grid approach on the one hand and the poisson approach on the other . in the poisson approach ,",
    "the sum equation   is rewritten as @xmath90        \\tau(e ; q)\\ , \\mathcal{f}(\\vec{q } ) .",

    "we note again that the s - wave component of the sum approach almost completely captures the full result , as discussed before . in the poisson approach , in contrast , the higher partial wave contributions are sizable .",
    "this is encouraging in view of the extension of this framework to the three - nucleon system , which will be the subject of a future publication . in the old framework , we compared the volume dependence of the triton  @xcite to results of a lattice chiral eft calculation  @xcite .",
    "the decline of the energy observed in the latter was much stronger .",

    "the most costly operation in this framework is finding eigenvalues , which is equivalent to performing a matrix diagonalization .",
    "this is in general an @xmath92 process for real non - symmetric matrices of dimension  @xmath93 . in both the grid and the sum approach ,",
    "the dimensionality of the matrix is dependent on the box side length as it determines the size of the discretized momentum space .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : count ] shows the number of vectors @xmath94 with @xmath95 , relevant for the grid approach , as well as the number of distinct absolute values of these vectors , relevant for the sum approach , for the two investigated cutoffs @xmath96 and @xmath97 . as @xmath1 increases ,",
    "the vectors in the discrete space @xmath98 lie closer to each other , eventually resembling the continuum .",

    "the scaling of the sum approach is much better than that of the grid approach , as expected . in the latter",
    ", the dimensionality of the matrix that has to be diagonalized in an @xmath102 operation scales like @xmath99 compared to @xmath103 for the sum approach .",
    "therefore , we expect the runtime of the grid approach to scale with three additional powers of @xmath104 . indeed , fitting power laws to the runtime behavior yields a scaling of @xmath105 for the sum approach and @xmath106 for the grid approach . the inclusion of the g - wave does not change the scaling of the code but merely increases the runtime by about 10% , independent of the cutoff .",
    "this is a significant improvement in comparison to the poisson approach employed in previous publications , where the inclusion of the g - wave increased the runtime by a factor of  4  @xcite . by using parallelized code",
    ", one should be able to significantly reduce the runtime for larger volumes where the matrix dimensionality exceeds about 2000 .",
    "the volume range where this is the case depends on the approach employed as well as the cutoff chosen .",

    "both approaches yield results that are in good agreement with the full calculation , with the former performing slightly better and the latter offering a significant reduction of runtime .",
    "this is an improvement compared to our previous framework where higher partial waves play a more pronounced role and their numerical treatment is more tedious .",
    "the next step is to extend the framework to the three - nucleon system and include higher orders of the eft .",
    "the latter is necessary in order to perform precision extrapolations of finite volume results .",
    "work in this direction is in progress and will be the subject of a future publication . with the new framework , it is also possible to study states that extrapolate to a scattering state in the infinite volume .",
    "this also allows one to examine , for example , three - body effects in lattice qcd simulations of nucleon - deuteron scattering .",
