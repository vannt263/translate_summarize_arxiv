    "arma identification methods usually lead to nonconvex optimization problems for which global convergence is not guaranteed , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "although these algorithms are simple and perform effectively , as observed in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) , no theoretically satisfactory approach to arma parameter estimation appears to be available .",
    "alternative , convex optimization approaches have been recently proposed by byrnes , georgiou , lindquist and co - workers @xcite in the frame of a broad research effort on analytic interpolation with degree contraint , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . in particular , @xcite describes a new setting for spectral estimation .",
    "this so - called _ three _ algorithm appears to allow for higher resolution in prescribed frequency bands and to be particularly suitable in case of short observation records .",
    "it effectively detects spectral lines and steep variations ( see @xcite for a recent biomedical application ) .",
    "an outline of this method is as follows .",
    "a given realization of a stochastic process ( a finite collection of data @xmath0 ) is fed to a suitably structured bank of filters , and the steady - state covariance matrix of the resulting output is estimated by statistical methods .",
    "only zeroth - order covariance lags of the output of the filters need to be estimated , ensuring statistical robustness of the method .",
    "finding now an input process whose _ rational _ spectrum is compatible with the estimated covariance poses naturally a nevanlinna - pick interpolation problem with bounded degree .",
    "the solution of this interpolation problem is considered as a mean of estimating the spectrum .",
    "a particular case described in the paper is the _ maximum differential entropy _ spectrum estimate , which amounts to the so - called central solution in the nevanlinna - pick theory .",
    "more generally , the scheme allows for a non constant _ a priori _",
    "estimate @xmath1 of the spectrum .",
    "the byrnes - georgiou - lindquist school has shown how this and other important problems of control theory may be advantageously cast in the frame of convex optimization .",
    "these problems admit a finite dimensional dual ( multipliers are matrices ! ) that can be shown to be solvable .",
    "the latter result , due to byrnes and lindquist @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is , however , nontrivial since the optimization occurs on an open , unbounded set of hermitian matrices .",
    "the numerical solution of the dual problem is also challenging @xcite , since the gradient of the dual functional tends to infinity at the boundary of the feasible set . finally , reparametrization of the problem may lead to loss of global concavity , see the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vii ) .",
    "this paper adds to this effort in that we consider estimation of a multivariate spectral density in the spirit of three @xcite , but employing a different metric for the optimization part , namely the _",
    "hellinger distance _ as in @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite , byrnes , gusev and lindquist chose the kullback - leibler divergence as a frequency weighted entropy measure , thus introducing a broad generalization of burg s maximum entropy method .",
    "more recently , this motivation was supported by the well - known connection with prediction error methods , see e.g. @xcite . in the multivariable case ,",
    "a kullback - leibler pseudodistance may also be readily defined @xcite inspired by the _ von neumann s relative entropy _ @xcite of statistical quantum mechanics .",
    "the resulting spectrum approximation problem , however , leads to computable solutions of bounded mcmillan degree only in the case when the prior spectral density is the identity matrix @xcite ( maximum entropy solution ) . on the contrary , with a suitable extension of the scalar hellinger distance introduced in @xcite , the hellinger approximation generalizes nicely to the multivariable case for any prior estimate @xmath1 of the spectrum .",
    "the main contributions of this paper , after some background material in sections ii - iv , are found in sections v - viii . in section",
    "v , we establish _ strong convexity _ and _ smoothness _ of the dual functional on a certain domain of hermitian matrices . in section",
    "vi , we analyze in detail a variant of a newton - type _ matricial _ iteration designed to numerically solve the dual of the multivariable spectrum approximation problem . it had originally been sketched in @xcite .",
    "the computational burden is dramatically reduced by systematically resorting to solutions of lyapunov and riccati equations thanks to various nontrivial results of _ spectral factorization_. we then show in section vii that the algorithm is _ globally _ convergent . finally , in section viii",
    ", we present guidelines for its application to multivariate spectral estimation and present some simulations comparing to existing methods .",
    "simulation in the multivariable case shows that , at the price of some moderate extra complexity in the model , our method may perform much better than matlab s pem and matlab s n4sid in the case of a short observation record .",
    "paper @xcite introduces and solves the following moment problem : given a bank of filters described by an input - to - state stable transfer function @xmath2 and a state covariance matrix @xmath3 , give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of input spectra @xmath4 such that the steady state output has variance @xmath3 , that is , @xmath5 moreover , parametrize the set of all such spectra ( here , and in the sequel , integration takes place on the unit circle @xmath6 with respect to normalized lebesgue measure @xmath7 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use the following notations : @xmath8 for matrices and @xmath9 for spectra and transfer functions .",
    "the scalar product between square matrices is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the family of @xmath12-valued functions defined on the unit circle which are hermitian , positive - definite , bounded and coercive .",
    "we have the following _ existence _",
    "result @xcite : there exists @xmath13 satisfying ( [ constraint ] ) if and only if there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath15 paper @xcite deals with the following ( scalar ) spectrum _ approximation _ problem : when constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is feasible , find the spectrum @xmath16 which minimizes the kullback - leibler pseudo distance @xmath17 from an `` a priori '' spectrum @xmath1 , subject to the _ constraint _ ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "it turns out that , if the prior @xmath1 is rational , the solution is also rational , and with degree that can be bounded in terms of the degrees of @xmath18 and @xmath1 .",
    "this problem again admits the maximum differential entropy spectrum ( compatible with the constraint ) as a particular case ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the above minimization poses naturally a variational problem , which can be solved using lagrange theory .",

    "we restated and solved a similar variational problem with respect to a different metric , namely the hellinger distance : @xmath20 equation ( [ scalarhellinger ] ) defines a _ bona fide _ distance , well - known in mathematical statistics .",

    "@xmath61 2ex    the underlying statement in proposition [ rangegammaprop ] , facts 1 and 2 , is that if we defined @xmath21 over the vector space of finite linear combinations of functions in @xmath62 , its range would remain the same .",
    "[ rangegammaremark ] proposition [ rangegammaprop ] shows that @xmath63 is the set of all the hermitian matrices @xmath3 for which there exists @xmath64 such that ( [ feasibility ] ) holds .",

    "another simple choice is @xmath380 , where @xmath381 is a low - order ar , ma or arma model estimated from @xmath364 by means of predictive error minimization methods or the like .",

    "these facts justify the theoretical interest in algorithms for constrained spectrum approximation , if for no other reason , as tools to compute at least _ one _ solution to a nevanlinna - pick interpolation or to a covariance extension problem , respectively .",
    "but the freedom in choosing @xmath18 has implications also in the above practical application to spectral estimation , where the key properties , not surprisingly , depend on the poles of @xmath18 , i.e. , the eigenvalues of @xmath75 . in general , as described in @xcite , the _ magnitude _ of the latter has implications on the variance of the sample covariance @xmath370 : the closer the eigenvalues to the origin , the smaller that variance ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii.d ) ) .",
    "moreover , at least as far as three @xcite is concerned , the _ phase _ of the eigenvalues influences resolution capability : more precisely , _ the spectrum estimation procedure has higher resolution in those sectors of the unit circle where more eigenvalues are located_. according to simulations , the latter statement appears to be true also in our setting ( the fundamental difference being that the metric which is minimized is the hellinger distance instead of the kullback - leibler one ) .    in the above setting @xmath370 is a consistent estimate of the true steady - state variance . although @xmath370 must belong to @xmath63 as @xmath386 ( this being the case",

    "the latter was constructed with random coefficients , except for one fixed conjugate pair of poles with radius @xmath416 and argument @xmath417 , and one fixed conjugate pair of zeros with radius @xmath418 and argument @xmath419 .",
    "the transfer function @xmath18 was chosen with one pole in the origin and @xmath420 complex pole pairs with radius @xmath416 and frequencies equispaced in the range @xmath421 $ ] . then the above estimating procedure was applied , with prior spectrum chosen as the constant density equal to the sample covariance of the bivariate process @xmath367 .",
    "figure [ estimfigure ] shows a plot of @xmath422 , @xmath423 , @xmath424 and @xmath425 , respectively for the true spectrum and for the estimation of the latter based on one run of 100 samples .        in figure [ comparisonfigure ]",
    "we compare the performances of various spectral estimation methods in the following way .",
    "we consider four estimates @xmath426 , @xmath427 , @xmath428 , and @xmath429 of @xmath16 .",
    "the spectral density @xmath426 is the estimate obtained by the procedure described above in subsection [ sep ] .",
    "the spectral density @xmath427 is the maximum entropy estimate @xcite obtained using the same @xmath18 employed to obtain our estimate .",
    "the spectral densities @xmath428 and @xmath430 are the estimates of @xmath16 obtained by using `` off - the - shelf '' matlab procedures for the prediction error method ( see i.e.  @xcite or @xcite ) and for the n4sid method ( see @xcite or @xcite ) : the former is a multivariable extension of the classical approach to armax identification , while the latter is a standard algorithm in the modern field of subspace identification . in order to obtain a comparison reasonably independent of the specific data set",
    ", we have performed @xmath431 independent runs each with @xmath432 samples of @xmath367 . in such a way we have obtained @xmath431 different estimates @xmath433 , @xmath434 , for each method .",
    ", @xmath435 , @xmath436 , and @xmath437 ( average over 50 simulations).,width=491 ]    we have then defined @xmath438 where @xmath439 denotes the spectral norm .",
    "this is understood as the average estimation error of our method at each frequency .",
    "similarly , we have defined the average errors @xmath440 , @xmath441 , and @xmath442 of the other methods . in the each of the plots of figure [ comparisonfigure ]",
    ", we depict the average error of our method @xmath443 together with the average error of one of the other methods .",
    "more explicitly , the first diagram shows the error for the hellinger approximation method and for the maximum entropy spectrum described in @xcite .",
    "the second diagram shows the error for the hellinger approximation and for the spectrum obtained via matlab s pem identification method .",
    "the third diagram shows the same for hellinger approximation and matlab s n4sid method .",
    "the hellinger approximation based approach appears to perform better or much better than the other methods .",
    "the simulation yields similar results with @xmath444 data points . with @xmath445 data samples , pem and n4sid perform as well as our method .",
    "of course , one should always take into account the complexity of the resulting spectrum . in this example , @xmath18 being of order @xmath446 , the resulting spectral factor ( or `` model '' ) produced by the hellinger approximation has order @xmath447 , whereas the corresponding maximum entropy model has order @xmath446 and both n4sid and pem usually choose order @xmath448 .    in our simulation ,",
    "the norm of the difference of two estimates produced by pem or by n4sid is sometimes very large when compared to the norm of the difference between any two of the estimates produced by our method .",
    "that is , although pem and n4sid are provably consistent as @xmath449 , when few data are available both of them may introduce occasional artifacts , which are well visible as `` peaks '' in figure [ comparisonfigure ] ( a `` peak '' in the 50-run average is due to a very high error in one of the runs , not to a systematic error ) .",
    "our method appears to be more robust in this respect .",
    "in this paper , we considered the the new approach to multivariate spectrum approximation problem with respect to the multivariable hellinger distance , which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we developed in detail the matricial newton algorithm which was sketched there , and proved its global convergence .",
    "finally , we described an application of this approach to spectral estimation , and tested it against the well - known pem and n4sid algorithms .",
    "it appears that approximation in the hellinger distance may be a useful tool to gain insight into the dynamics of a multivariate process when fewer data are available .",
    "in particular , simulations suggest that this method is less prone to produce artifacts than pem and n4sid .",
    "another advantage of our method and of the maximum entropy paradigm is that a higher resolution estimate in a prescribed frequency band can be easily achieved by properly placing some poles of @xmath18 close to the unit circle and with phase in the prescribed band .    _",
    "numerical _ robustness of the algorithm with respect to the number and the position of the poles is an open challenge .",
    "also , the analysis of the achievable precision of the results ( in a statistical sense ) has still to be developed .",
