    "temporal periodic modulation of scattering length by exploiting a feshbach resonance is given a central importance in recent times .",
    "earlier studies show that , in certain circumstances , periodically varying scattering length can stabilize the collapsing condensate  @xcite .",

    "resonance is an interesting feature of an oscillation under the action of an external periodic force manifesting in a large amplitude , when the frequency of the external force equals an integral multiple of the natural frequency of oscillation .",
    "although , the phenomenon of resonance is well understood in linear systems , the nonlinearity that arises in the bose - einstein condensates due to the inter - atomic interactions leads to an important problem of nonlinear resonance of wide interest .    in general , there are two ways of driving a nonlinear oscillator by small driving periodic force , namely , external and parametric .",
    "if the driving frequency is constant ( that is , driving force is exactly periodic with time ) , the initial growth of the oscillator s amplitude with time is arrested by its nonlinearity . on the other hand , if the driving frequency is slowly varying with time (",
    "driving force is almost periodic with time ) , the oscillator can stay phase locked but , on an average , increase its amplitude with time or a persistent growth in the amplitude takes place , and this phenomenon is known as _",

    "the nonlinear frequency is slowly varying with time .",
    "this autoresonance phenomena is also referred as adiabatic nonlinear phase locking and synchronization . however , in certain nonlinear systems , frequency is independent of the amplitude of oscillation @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "when the driving frequency is slowly varying with time , one might expect successive resonance excitations at subharmonic frequencies .",
    "we refer this type to resonance as a kind of subharmonic autoresonance @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we identify such a subharmonic autoresonance in bose - einstein condensates where it shows successive resonance excitations due to periodic modulation with slowly varying frequency . in bose - einstein condensates",
