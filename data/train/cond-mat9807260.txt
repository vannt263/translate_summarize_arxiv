    "the statistical physics of random and frustrated systems has received a considerable deal of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the presence of quenched disorder has been found to greatly change the bulk and interface properties of a variety of systems as compared with their pure counterparts , leading to new and very interesting equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "unfortunately the progress has been many times rather slow , primarily because random systems pose sometimes insurmountable theoretical difficulties even to the most stubborn theorists .",
    "computer simulations have played and continue to play an important role in the field , being at times the only guide through a very complicated energy landscape . while the traditional monte carlo method @xcite proved its usefulness again and again , it was soon realized that other approaches should be considered , depending on the nature of the problem at hand . since",
    "then a variety of algorithms , previously known only within the computer science community , have been successfully brought to bear on numerous statistical mechanics problems with quenched disorder , from spin glasses @xcite to rigidity percolation @xcite .",
    "such algorithms , generally known as combinatorial optimization algorithms , have been typically used to find the exact @xmath1 ground states of the system being studied , completely avoiding the equilibration problems specific to the monte carlo simulations .    in the following",
    "i will focus on a single class of such algorithms , network flow algorithms , that have been put in the limelight by the work of ogielski @xcite , who applied them to the study of the random field ising model ( rfim ) .",
    "since then the same method was also successfully applied to the study of equilibrium interfaces in disordered systems @xcite , becoming an important tool for the physicists working in the field .",
    "the method is generally based upon mapping the system being studied onto a network of capacities through which an incompressible fluid obeying local mass conservation flows .",
    "the problem of finding the ground state turns out to be equivalent to finding the maximum flow that can be pushed through the network between two special nodes , the source and the sink , the so called max - flow / min - cut problem of operations research @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that polynomial time algorithms have been developed for this problem@xcite , some of which are much older than the field of random systems .",
    "one of the problems that was usually not addressed using these algorithms and an important problem in the physics of random systems is the degeneracy of the @xmath1 ground states . in terms of the associated network flow problem",
    "this is the question of minimum cut degeneracy .",
    "an approximate algorithm dealing with this issue was proposed in @xcite and applied to the rfim problem . in this paper",
    "i build on the max - flow / min - cut approach , relying strongly on the concept of residual graph @xcite , and design an exact algorithm for finding all the minimum - cuts ( or equivalently all the ground states for a certain class of systems ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : for the sake of completeness section ii introduces the mapping of the ground state problem to the max - flow / min - cut problem along with the network flow terminology and two combinatorial results that will be used in the design of the algorithm , section iii describes the degeneracy algorithm , section iv presents a number of applications of the algorithm and the appendix includes the proofs to propositions 1 - 4 .",
    "in the following i will present the mapping of the ground state problem to the max - flow / min - cut problem and then proceed to describe what kind of information one can extract from this mapping .",
    "i will use the @xmath1 interface problem in the random bond ising ferromagnet to illustrate the method because it is somewhat easier for the unfamiliar reader to understand it intuitively ( see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ferromagnetic couplings between neighboring spins .",
    "@xmath5 are fixed independent identically distributed random variables - quenched randomness .",
    "if the system is a @xmath6-dimensional cube , an interface with dimension @xmath7 can be induced by using periodic boundary conditions along @xmath7 directions and setting the spins in the two @xmath7 dimensional hyperplanes that represent the boundaries of the system along the last direction to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the interface that will form in the system between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 hyperplanes will generally be rough , because it will wander in order to break the weakest bonds .",
    "the energy is a minimum over all the possible spin configurations ( with the @xmath10 boundary spins fixed ) and therefore the problem of finding the minimum energy configuration(s ) would appear to be computationally very hard , even for small system sizes .",
    "as it turns out , this is not the case if one takes advantage of the similarity between this problem and the max - flow / min - cut problem , very well known in the study of transportation networks @xcite .",
    "the idea is the following : two new extra sites are introduced , a source node @xmath11 that is connected to all the spins of the @xmath8 hyperplane , and a sink node @xmath12 connected to all the spins of the @xmath9 hyperplane . the ferromagnetic constants coupling the source node @xmath13 and the sink node @xmath14 to their corresponding hyperplane",
    "are chosen to be strong enough so they are not broken in the ground state . then by setting @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 an interface is induced as before .",
    "now we view the system , including @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as a graph whose arcs are the bonds between the spins .",
    "the arcs have forward and backward capacities equal with the corresponding coupling constants , @xmath17 , or we can imagine that the nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are connected by both forward and backward arcs with capacities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so this is a directed graph .",
    "( the constraint that @xmath22 is dictated by the physics and is not specific to the general max - flow / min - cut problem .",
    "it can be relaxed for the interface problem , but not for the random field problem . )",
    "we define the set of nodes as @xmath23 and a partition @xmath24 of the nodes as @xmath25 @xmath26 then @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the knowledge of such a partition determines the energy of the spin configuration and the position of the interface .",
    "this is readily seen if we write the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy of the fully aligned system , @xmath33 , and we defined @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus the problem of finding the ground state interface , which has minimum energy , is equivalent to finding a partition @xmath24 , also called a cut , that minimizes @xmath37 - _ minimum cut_. ( note that @xmath32 is a constant for a given random sample . )",
    "if we imagine fluid flowing through the network from the source @xmath11 to the sink @xmath12 , the minimum cuts are the bottlenecks of the network of capacities because they determine the maximum flow that can be pushed through the network from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "it is useful at this point to put the problem in a more general setting . for this",
    "a number of definitions are in order .",
    "a _ transportation network _ is a directed graph @xmath38 with two special nodes , @xmath11 - source and @xmath12 - sink or target ; @xmath23 is the set of nodes and @xmath39 the set of arcs .",

    "( note that @xmath50 follows from the flow conservation @xcite . )",
    "the _ maximum flow problem _ of network flows is concerned with finding the flow @xmath45 through the transportation network @xmath51 that has maximum value @xmath49 .    for any feasible flow through the network",
    "we define the _ residual graph _ as the graph @xmath52 with positive _ residual capacities _ of the arcs , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the net flow from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",

    "an _ augmenting path _ is a directed path from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in the residual graph @xmath59 .",
    "a _ cut _ is a partition of the nodes set @xmath23 into two subsets @xmath60 and @xmath61 , denoted by @xmath24 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the _ capacity of a cut _ is defined as : @xmath62    in the following i will concentrate on the case of a transportation network @xmath38 in which if the arc @xmath40 exists and has capacity @xmath42 than the arc @xmath43 also exists and has capacity @xmath58 .",
    "this kind of network is the most relevant one in the physics applications that i described before . for these networks",
    "the following two propositions can be proven ( the proofs are contained in the appendix ) , that can be used to design an algorithm that finds all the minimum cuts in the network @xmath38 .    :",

    "the first such algorithm , the _ augmenting path algorithm _ @xcite , was proposed originally by ford and fulkerson and it is also a way to prove the max - flow / min - cut theorem ( see appendix ) . however , much faster algorithms have been developed in recent years , in particular push - relabel methods with global updates , that allow one to deal with much bigger systems than before @xcite .",
    "these algorithms can be and have been used in such a way as to improve the computational speed by providing only the value of the maximal flow and a minimum cut , but not an actual maximal flow through the network @xcite .",
    "however , the knowledge of an actual maximal flow through the network is crucial for finding all the minimum cuts .",
    "fortunately , such a calculation can be made without a major loss of speed @xcite .",
    "in the following i will use propositions 1 and 2 to design an algorithm that finds all the minimum cuts .",
    "the algorithm will be aimed at finding the set of arcs @xmath68 , denoted thereafter by @xmath69 , and a procedure for determining the actual minimum cuts .",
    "let us assume that we constructed a maximal flow @xmath70 through the network @xmath71 using an appropriate algorithm and let @xmath72 be the associated residual graph .",

    "( _ proof _ : let us assume @xmath78 ; then @xmath79 .",
    "because @xmath63 is a directed cut ( proposition 2 ) , for any node @xmath80 there is no directed path from @xmath18 to the sink @xmath12 in @xmath67 , which must also be true for any @xmath81 .",
    "but @xmath82 , so this is a contradiction . ) we also define : @xmath83 @xmath84 then @xmath85 is also a minimum cut that we call the @xmath86 cut .",

    "( note that these arcs are saturated by the flow , that is @xmath64 , so in @xmath67 only the arcs @xmath43 are present ) . by the construction of @xmath92 we also know that all the remaining arcs that make up @xmath69 connect nodes that are included in @xmath92 .",
    "the first part of the algorithm is aimed at finding the disconnected pieces ( clusters ) that make up @xmath92 , and is therefore called _",
    "cluster counting_. a look at fig .",
    "[ rfim ] , which is an application of the algorithm to the bimodal rfim , clarifies the significance of this step .",
    "the idea is to determine the connectivity of @xmath92 in @xmath72 using as connectivity rule @xmath93 , which is equivalent to @xmath94 .",
    "this procedure does not reveal any new arcs of @xmath69 , but shows how the minimum cuts are constructed using the arcs of @xmath69 that we know at this moment .",
    "the well known hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite , which is a an efficient cluster labeling procedure , can be readily adapted for the cluster counting task , and allows such a calculation to be made in a time proportional with the number of nodes in @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "[ 2step ] summarizes our knowledge of the minimum cuts after this step .",
    "it is easy to see that the number of minimum cuts that we can construct at this time is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the number of independent clusters making up @xmath92 . our search for the remaining minimum cuts",
    "is then reduced to finding the minimum cuts in each of the independent clusters . if @xmath97 the algorithm can be stopped here as everything is known about the minimum cuts .",
    "any partition of the @xmath96 clusters is a minimum cut and the total number of minimum cuts is @xmath95 .",
    "( note that if @xmath66 the zero step of the algorithm should be to find the cluster percolating from @xmath11 to @xmath12 with the above connectivity rule .",
    "all the other clusters contribute in a trivial manner to the minimum cuts , therefore in the following we assume that they have been already discarded . )    in the second part of the algorithm we perform a _",
    "subcluster counting _",
    "procedure on each of the independent clusters found at the first step .",
    "the connectivity rule that we use is @xmath98 .",
    "it is clear , using proposition 1 , that the subclusters so obtained can only be on one side or the other of a minimum cut , i.e. the set @xmath69 is included in the set of arcs that connect these subclusters to one another ( we formally call @xmath99 and @xmath100 subclusters ) . in order to eliminate the overcounting",
    ", we apply a third procedure called _ subcluster coagulation_.    at the end of the second step of the algorithm the subclusters",
    "are connected with each other possibly through multiple arcs with @xmath64 and @xmath101 .",
    "subcluster coagulation _ procedure is applied iteratively on each of the independent clusters and consists of the coagulation of subclusters that make up a directed cycle .",
    "a directed cycle is an ordered sequence of subclusters , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , ... , @xmath104 , such that for all @xmath105 , @xmath106 , exist @xmath107 , @xmath108 nodes , @xmath109 , not necessarily distinct , with the property that @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "the idea is that , according to proposition 2 , subclusters making up a such directed cycle can not be on different parts of a minimum cut , therefore the arcs connecting them are not included in @xmath69 ( see also the discussion following proposition 4 ) .",
    "a hoshen - kopelman type algorithm , in which the subcluster coagulation is achieved through relabeling of the subclusters , is again rather efficient at handling this task , but managing the data structure requires rather intricate coding .    at the end of the algorithm",
    "we have constructed a supergraph like the one in fig .",
    "[ 3step ] , which we denote by @xmath113 , with single directed arcs and no cycles .",
    "the nodes are now the subclusters and the arcs stand , as before , for possibly more than one arc of @xmath114 .",
    "formally , the arc @xmath115 going from the subcluster @xmath116 to subcluster @xmath117 is defined by : @xmath118 and by the construction of the algorithm @xmath64 and @xmath101 for all arcs @xmath119 .",
    "then we define @xmath120 , the set of arcs of @xmath114 represented by the arcs of @xmath113 .",
    "the following proposition is then true ( see appendix for the proof ) :    : at the end of the algorithm @xmath121 .",
    "when the algorithm terminates @xmath69 is known and moreover , the problem of counting the minimum cuts is reduced to finding all the directed partitions in a directed , much smaller supergraph - @xmath113 - with single arcs and no cycles .",
    "simple enumeration is therefore feasible if the independent clusters are not too big .",
    "the degeneracy ( total number of minimum cuts ) @xmath122 can be written as : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the degeneracy associated with cluster @xmath18 , @xmath125 .",
    "one additional result can be proven ( the proof is contained in the appendix ) , that was also probably known by ford and fulkerson @xcite , that further clarifies the meaning of @xmath69 .",
    ": @xmath69 is the set of arcs of @xmath91 that will be saturated by all the maximal flows ( the weak links of the network ) .",
    "the above proposition makes it easier to understand intuitively the significance of the subcluster coagulation step of the algorithm .",
    "it is clear that the flows between subclusters are all saturating and also that the flow conservation holds for each subcluster as a unit .",
    "therefore , if for a certain maximal flow we identify a saturating flow cycle between subclusters , we can reduce the flow around the cycle by its smallest value between two subclusters making up the cycle , while keeping the overall flow maximal .",
    "this implies that none of the arcs making up the cycle is necessarily saturated when the flow is maximal , therefore , according to proposition 4 , they are not part of @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , because of the way the subclusters have been constructed , none of the arcs connecting the subclusters making up the cycle is part of @xmath69 , so the subclusters can be coagulated .",
    "our interest in designing a degeneracy algorithm arose in connection with our desire to study the ground state properties of random magnets .",
    "we first used the above algorithm to study the ground state structure of the two - dimensional @xmath126 random field ising model ( rfim ) , that we expected to have a large degeneracy .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rfim is : @xmath127 @xmath128 and @xmath129 s are independent random variables drawn from a symmetric distribution @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in the case of the @xmath126 rfim the @xmath133",
    "are , with equal probability , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "this problem is mapped onto the network flow problem by connecting the sites with positive fields to the source and the ones with negative fields to the sink through arcs with capacity @xmath136 ( see for example @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the structure of a @xmath126 rfim ground state is shown in fig .",
    "[ rfim ] : two frozen ferromagnetic domains of up and down spins and a number of isolated clusters that can be flipped ( colored ) independently of each other to generate new ground states .",
    "there is also a degeneracy associated to flipping certain groups of subclusters inside a cluster .",
    "surprisingly , domains that can be flipped without changing the energy exist even if @xmath137 is irrational . in this case",
    "they have zero field energy and the same exchange energy in the up and down states , and are located at the boundary of the frozen domains .",
    "the smallest such clusters have only two spins ( see fig . [ rfim ] ) . as a result of this structure",
    "the @xmath126 rfim has a strictly positive entropy for a range of @xmath137 , and related with it a new order parameter , the paramagnetic response associated with the orientation of the above domains .",
    "this result may be relevant to universality issues that are currently being debated @xcite .",
    "a similar structure is found for the dilute ising antiferromagnet in a constant field ( daff ) , fig .",

    "<S> it has been known for a long time that the ground state problem of random magnets , e.g. random field ising model ( rfim ) , can be mapped onto the max - flow / min - cut problem of transportation networks . </S>",
    "<S> i build on this approach , relying on the concept of residual graph , and design an algorithm that i prove to be exact for finding all the minimum cuts , i.e. the ground state degeneracy of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate that this algorithm is also relevant for the study of the ground state properties of the dilute ising antiferromagnet in a constant field ( daff ) and interfaces in random bond magnets .    </S>",
