    "optical system for imaging and low resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris ) is an imager and spectrograph for the optical wavelength range , located in the nasmyth - b focus of the 10.4-m _ gran telescopio canarias _",
    "( gtc ) @xcite .",
    "apart from the standard broad - band imaging and long - slit spectroscopy , it provides additional capability such as narrow - band tunable filter ( tf ) imaging , charge - shuffling and multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "osiris covers the wavelength range from 0.365 to 1.05  @xmath9 m with an unvignetted field of view ( fov ) of @xmath10arcmin@xmath11 , for direct imaging .",
    "narrow - band imaging is made possible through the use of a tf , which is in essence a low resolution fabry - perot etalon .",
    "the filter is tuned by setting a specific separation between the optical plates of the fabry - perot .",
    "osiris has two different tfs : one for the blue range ( 37506750 ; yet to be commissioned ) , and another for the red range ( 65109350 ) . in this work ,",
    "we describe the results for the latter ( red ) etalon .",
    "the relatively large fov on a 10-m telescope , combined with the tunable nature of the filters , opens up a new method of observation , which can be useful in a variety of astrophysical contexts , both galactic and extragalactic .",
    "the use of narrow - band filters , adequately defined to map certain spectral regions , allows the detailed study at seeing - limited resolution , of the spatial distribution of the ionized gas properties and recent star formation , and of the associated stellar populations . flux calibrated images in the bright lines of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen and sulphur in the optical , allow us to map , among other parameters , the metallicity gradients in galaxies using imaging techniques rather than the time - consuming spectroscopic techniques that are in use currently @xcite .",
    "this has motivated recently built large telescopes such as the 11-m south african large telescope @xcite or the magellan baade 6.5-m telescope @xcite to have tfs for imaging .",
    "we are presently engaged in a survey of galaxies in the local universe ( lusgtc - lus/]= local universe survey ) that includes all galaxies inside a volume of 3.5  mpc in radius that are visible from la palma .",
    "ifu observations of these galaxies present two problems : ifu observations would represent a huge drop in spatial resolution and , with a median d@xmath12 of 4.5@xmath13 , they are too large to be observed even with the largest available ifu .    @xcite used template spectra typical of star - forming galaxies to estimate the errors in derived flux for extragalactic point - like sources on the osiris tf images .",
    "however , photometric accuracy of the tf images of extended objects using observed data is yet to be evaluated . in this study",
    ", we explore the capabilities of tf for obtaining flux calibrated images using observations acquired with osiris tf .",
    "the osiris etalon is placed in a converging beam , which results in the variation of the effective wavelength over the fov @xcite . for the red etalon ,",
    "the change is as much as 80 over the 4@xmath13 radius , thus limiting the monochromatic fov to less than 2@xmath13 radius @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tf spectral response function ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn_rlambda ] ) has a long tail , which difficults the flux calibration of a faint line in the neighborhood of a bright one .",
    "for example h@xmath2 line contaminates even if the tf is tuned to detect the [ nii]@xmath3 line .",
    "given that these characteristics of tf are well - understood , flux calibrated monochromatic images over the entire fov can be obtained using a tailor - made post - observation reconstruction software .",
    "the fact that the filters are tunable , in addition , creates its own problems for absolute flux calibration due to the non - standard nature of the filters .",
    "observing spectrophotometric standard stars at each tuned wavelength is a solution , but it is costly in terms of telescope time .",
    "alternatively , small telescopes could be used to carry out spectrophotometric observations of the in - frame field stars . the recent sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "spectrophotometric survey of field stars @xcite offers an attractive solution to the problem , that does not require any telescope time for calibration purposes . in this paper , we explore the use of this database to spectrophotometrically calibrate the in - frame sdss photometric stars .    in  2",
    ", we describe the data used in this work .",
    "the method we followed for reconstructing a monochromatic image and its implementation are described in ",
    " 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity of the reconstructed emission line fluxes to various observational parameters is studied using simulated images in  5 where we also suggest guidelines for planning imaging observations with osiris / tf .",
    "the flux calibration technique and accuracy are described in  6 .",
    "fluxes of selected hii  regions in the reconstructed image are compared to an h@xmath2 image obtained in a traditional way in  7 .",
    "the results of this study are summarized in  8 .",
    "osiris uses two ccds of @xmath14 pixel format to cover its total fov of @xmath0 , with a physical gap of @xmath15 between the two ccds .",
    "each one has 50 additional overscan pixels at the beginning of the array , thus resulting in a format of @xmath16 for each image .",
    "the optical center of osiris lies in the central gap as described in @xcite and also in the osiris user manual .",
    "astrometric calibration is required before being able to mosaic the images registered in the two ccds . by performing astrometry of 10 stars on each ccd that are distributed over the entire fov",
    ", we found that the image scale is slightly different for the two ccds .",
    "the left and right ccds have values of 0.127/pixel and 0.129/pixel , respectively , with an average value of 0.128/pixel .",
    "this average value agrees well with the theoretically expected value of the plate scale for the gtc / osiris instrument parameters listed in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the reconstruction technique using observations of m101 aimed at obtaining continuum - free images of the h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath3 , [ sii]@xmath4 and [ sii]@xmath5 emission lines over a fov of @xmath0 .",
    "the observations were carried out at the gtc in two observing runs on june 22 and 26 in 2009 , the former for the [ sii]@xmath17 lines and the latter for the h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath3 lines .",
    "table  1 describes the details of these two observing runs .",
    "the telescope pointing remained the same for all images ( wavelengths ) constituting a tf scan .",
    "the telescope position was then dithered by 6  and the entire sequence was repeated .",
    "this was done in order to facilitate removal of any detector artefacts . for a given region in the galaxy ,",
    "the two dithered tf images have slightly different wavelength and hence different response for the detection of a line .",
    "thus it is important to take into account these response differences before coadding them .",
    "we handled the dithered image sets as independent sets of data and used them to estimate internal errors in the flux calibration ( see  6 ) .",
    "for the h@xmath18[nii ] scan , observations were carried out at two dithered positions ( p1 and p2 , henceforth ) , whereas for the [ sii ] scan , three dithered positions were used ( p1 , p2 and p3 , henceforth ) .",
    ".[tab : obs]gtc observing blocks summary [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    when these systematic variations in @xmath19  are taken into account , the calibration coefficients obtained using different stars in different ccds and in different tf images , agree to within 3% of each other .",
    "the mean calibration coefficients obtained from the stars on the right ccd of the first image of the h@xmath2 and [ sii ] scans are given in table  [ tab : calcoef ] .",
    "the difference in the calibration coefficients for the two h@xmath2 scans is of the order of 1% , whereas for the [ sii ] scans this difference is around 3% .",
    "the mean difference in the calibration coefficients for the h@xmath2 and [ sii ] scans is @xmath20% .",

    "the h@xmath2 line being a good tracer of ionized gas , this image shows the location of hii  complexes and ionized filaments .",
    "it can be seen from the image that we are able to detect hii  regions in the entire field of view .",
    "the @xmath32 surface brightness limit in this image is @xmath33  erg@xmath34s@xmath35arcsec@xmath36 .",
    "all the regions seen in the image are recovered in the two independent scans . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we compare the fluxes of recovered emission lines of hii   regions in these two independent scans .",
    "our h@xmath2 fluxes are also compared with the h@xmath2 fluxes obtained using traditional narrow - band imaging technique .",
    "we performed photometry of 23 hii  regions using an aperture radius of 4  on our reconstructed h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath3 , [ sii ] images and also on an h@xmath18[nii ] image that was obtained in the traditional way using narrow - band filters ( downloaded from ned : telescope : kpno schmidt ; observers : b. greenawalt , and r. walterbos ) .",
    "the selected regions are among the brightest regions in the fov .    with a sampling of @xmath37",
    "  for our dataset , @xmath38 should be at least 0.45 in order to obtain an image without data gaps",
    ". however , we found systematically larger dispersion in fluxes for regions with response values less than 0.5 .",

    "eight regions have data in only one of the dithered scans . in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp1]a , we show a comparison of the fluxes of the 15 hii  regions whose fluxes could be measured on the reconstructed images from both the scans .",
    "the mean ratio of the h@xmath2 fluxes is unity over 2 orders of magnitude in flux , confirming the accuracy of the method we adopted for the flux calibration .",
    "the rms dispersion of the h@xmath2 fluxes of the same region obtained on images for the two scans is 16% .",
    "this value is within the flux errors expected for the 12    error in @xmath40 .    in order to check whether the reconstruction process rightly reproduces relative fluxes of different regions over the entire fov",
    ", we plot the ratio of the h@xmath18[nii]@xmath3 fluxes measured from our reconstructed images ( p1 and p2 ) , and that from traditional narrow - band filters in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp1]b .",
    "our fluxes are given as the average when data are available from both scans .",
    "as the intention here is a comparison of relative fluxes , we set the mean value of the flux ratio to unity .",
    "there is @xmath7% scatter on this mean value , which is marginally better than that between p1 and p2 , as expected due to the use of averaged fluxes .",
    "there is a marginal trend for the mean ratio to be @xmath41% different between the bright and faint regions , which is nevertheless smaller than the scatter .",
    "we did not find any trend of these two ratios against the distance of the region from the optical center .",
    "three sources of error are included in calculating the sizes of the error bars plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp1 ] .",
    "they are ( 1 ) photon noise of the object , ( 2 ) the error in the subtraction of the sky value and ( 3 ) the error in the recovered flux due to an error in @xmath42 .",
    "the last of these errors , which is discussed in detail in  5 , dominates for the 23 regions for which we performed photometry , contributing around 10% for the majority of the regions .    as a second test of the reliability of the flux ratios obtained using the tf images",
    ", we compare the flux ratios of emission lines relevant for diagnostic diagrams with those values obtained using spectra from the literature for the same regions .",
    "seventeen hii  regions in m101 were observed spectroscopically by sdss @xcite .",
    "six of these lie within the usable fov of our images ( radial distance from the optical center @xmath43 ) . flux ratio of nebular diagnostic lines from our reconstructed images are compared with those obtained from the sdss spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig_sdss_comp ] .",
    "our fluxes were obtained over apertures of @xmath44 radius at the coordinates associated with the sdss spectra .",
    "the adopted apertures , though almost 3 times bigger than the fiber sizes of sdss spectra ( 3  diameter ) , are the minimum area over which reliable fluxes can be measured in our images .",
    "given that the spectroscopic ratios of giant hii   regions are not expected to vary much with aperture size , our relatively bigger apertures are not expected to introduce additional errors .",
    "the difference in the flux ratios between ours and sdss values are plotted both against flux ratios ( in the left panel ) and h@xmath2 fluxes ( in the right panel ) .",
    "the plotted error bars take into account all the errors discussed in the paragraph above .",
    "the errors in the spectroscopic ratios are expected to be almost negligible , and hence we did not include these errors in our analysis .",
    "the majority of the points lie close to the horizontal line within the plotted errors , indicating that the ratios of lines relevant for diagnostic purposes can be obtained using tf imaging .",
    "there are a few ratios that deviate from the spectroscopic ratios by more than the estimated errors .",
    "the most important of them is the right - most point in panel ( a ) .",
    "apart from being the faintest in h@xmath2 , the spectroscopic [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath2 value for this region is 0.4 , a value that is too high as compared to the assumed value of 0.1 in eqn  [ eqn_recon8 ] . this is the most likely reason for the large deviation of this region .",
    "kinematics of individual regions with radial velocities @xmath45  kms@xmath35 ( i.e. 0.5    around the h@xmath2 wavelength ) can also be responsible for the observed deviations of some of the points .",
    "the errors in the measured radial velocities of the regions from sdss spectra do not permit us to carry out a more elaborate analysis of the deviations of individual regions .    in summary ,",
    "the ratios recovered from the tf images for individual regions have larger errors than the corresponding spectroscopic ratios .",
    "nevertheless , the capability of tf images to derive such ratios for large number of regions , makes tf imaging a scientifically attractive option , as we illustrate below using the flux ratio of 23 hii  regions in m101 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp2 ] , we plot the [ nii]@xmath256583/h@xmath2 , [ sii]@xmath26/h@xmath2 , and the [ sii]@xmath27 ratio of hii  regions against their h@xmath2 fluxes in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . in each of these panels ,",
    "we indicate the observed / theoretical ranges of these ratios in hii   regions , which cover @xmath46 times the errors on the ratios .",
    "this relatively large dynamic range , combined with the intrinsic multi - object capability of tf imaging , makes it competitive with traditional spectroscopic observations .",
    "the [ nii ] and [ sii ] lines originate in low ionization zones in hii  regions .",
    "their ratio to the h@xmath2 flux depends not only on the ionization parameter , but also on the abundance of these ions .",
    "the utility of these ratios for diagnostic purposes has been discussed in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_comp3 ] , we show the values for these ratios expected for a range of ionization parameters ( @xmath47 ) and metallicities ( @xmath48 ) , using the models of @xcite",
    ". the observed values of these ratios in our selected 23 regions lie within the range of model values .",
    "the regions having high values of [ nii]/h@xmath2 have most likely high nitrogen abundances , as was found by @xcite for hii  regions in a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "thus , osiris tf imaging is very promising for the study of nebular line ratio diagnostics of nearby large galaxies .",
    "in this work , we have explored the capability of tunable filter imaging with the osiris instrument at the 10.4-m gtc , using real data .",
    "the changing wavelength across the field and the non - flat functional form of the response curves makes it essential to have a sophisticated analysis package to completely take advantage of the relatively large field of view of the instrument . with the set - up that we have used to observe m101",
    ", we were able to obtain monochromatic images in the emission lines of h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath3 and the [ sii ] doublet .",
    "we demonstrate that line fluxes and their ratios for prominent hii  regions can be obtained to better than @xmath615% , which is basically limited by the current 1    uncertainty in setting the central wavelength of the tf . though these errors are much larger than the spectroscopic ones , the multi - object capability of tf imaging , combined with the relatively high sensitivity of the flux ratios to variations in density , excitation and metallicity , makes tf imaging an attractive option for investigating the point - to - point variation of these physical quantities in galaxies .",
    "we also demonstrate that the emission - line maps can be flux - calibrated to better than 3% accuracy , using the @xmath8 sdss magnitudes of in - frame stars , and the spectral database of sdss , without the need to invest extra telescope time to perform the photometry of spectrophotometric stars .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank an anonymous referee , whose thoughtful comments helped us to improve the original manuscript .",
