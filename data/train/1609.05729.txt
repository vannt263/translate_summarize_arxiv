    "planets around k - giant stars may provide us with clues on the dependence of planet formation on stellar mass .",
    "the progenitors of k - giant stars are often intermediate - mass main - sequence a - f stars . while on the main sequence these stars are not amenable to precise radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "there is a paucity of stellar lines due to high effective temperatures and these are often broadened by rapid rotation .",
    "therefore one can not easily achieve the rv precision needed for the detection of planetary companions . on the other hand ,",
    "when these stars evolve to giant stars they are cooler and have slower rotation rates and a rv accuracy of a few@xmath6 can readily be achieved .",
    "the giant stars thus serve as proxies for planet searches around intermediate - mass ( 1.22 @xmath7 ) early - type main - sequence stars .",
    "since the discovery of the first exoplanet around k - giant stars @xcite , over 90 exoplanets ( 3 per cent of the total in september 2016 ) have been discovered orbiting giant stars .",
    "these planet - hosting giant stars are on average more massive than planet - hosting main - sequence stars .",
    "@xcite showed , based on an empirical correlation , that the frequency of giant planets increases with stellar mass to about 14 per cent for a - type stars .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical predictions of @xcite , who concluded that the probability that a given star has at least one gas giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 to 3 @xmath8 .",
    "statistical analysis of microlensing and transiting data reveals that cool neptunes and super - earths are even more common than jupiter - mass planets @xcite .    unlike for a main - sequence star where there is more or less a direct mapping between effective temperature and stellar mass , it is more problematic to determine the stellar mass of a giant star .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for stars covering a wide range of masses all converge to the similar region of the h - r diagram .",
    "one way to obtain the stellar mass is to rely on evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , they are not only model dependent , but they require accurate stellar parameters such as the effective temperature and heavy element abundance .",
    "@xcite argued that the masses of giant stars in doppler surveys were only in the range 1.0  1.2 @xmath8 and thus were not intermediate - mass stars .",
    "clearly , we can not disentangle the effect of stellar mass on the observed planet properties if we can not get a reliable measurement of the stellar mass .    the stellar mass",
    "can be derived from solar - like oscillations .",
    "the first firm discovery of solar - like oscillations in a giant star was made using rvs by @xcite .",
    "however , it was only recently that solar - like oscillations were unambiguously found in late - type giant stars , owing to space - based photometric observations by the _",
    "corot _ @xcite and the _ kepler _",
    "@xcite missions .",
    "solar - like p - mode oscillations of the same degree are equally spaced in frequency and the spacing is related to the square root of the mean stellar density ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) , whereas the frequency of maximum oscillation power is @xmath9 @xmath11 @xcite . from these empirical relations",
    "we can calculate both the stellar mass and radius in a more or less model independent way .",
    "the _ kepler _ space mission has been monitoring a sample of over 13,000 red - giant stars which can be used for asteroseismic studies .",
    "all stars show stellar oscillations that have been analysed to determine their fundamental stellar parameters @xcite and internal stellar structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an estimate of the stellar age can be obtained using stellar models @xcite .",
    "giant stars observed with _ kepler _",
    "represent a unique sample for planet searches as a planetary detection would mean that we can determine reliable stellar properties via asteroseismic analysis , characteristics not well known for many other planet - hosting giant stars .",
    "for this reason , we started a planet - search program among _ kepler _ asteroseismic - giant stars in 2010 .",
    "we have distributed our targets over four different telescopes in order to maximize the detection and to minimize the impact of telescope resources at a single site .",
    "these telescopes include the 2-m telescope at thringer landessternwarte tautenburg ( tls ) , germany ( 29 stars , since 2010 ) , the 1.2-m mercator telescope , la palma , spain ( 38 stars , since 2011 ) , the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope , la palma , spain ( 12 stars , since 2012 ) and the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory , texas , us ( 33 stars , since 2012 ) . in total",
    "our sample contains 95 giant stars , a statistically significant number given an expected detection rate of @xmath1215 per cent .",
    "we observe some targets in common at different sites , in order to check our measurements independently .    until now ,",

    "[ plot5 ] and the frequency spectrum is displayed in the second panel from the bottom of fig .",
    "[ plot6 ] .",
    "we found a dominant period of 370 d which agrees very well with the orbital period of the _ kepler _ satellite .",
    "every 3 months , the _ kepler _ satellite was reoriented ( rotated one - quarter turn ) and then the light from each target star was collected by a new set of pixels on a different ccd . for precision photometry , this will introduce systematic errors .",
    "in addition , the orbital period of the _ kepler _ satellite , 372.5  d , will also introduce systematic errors in the relative photometry .",
    "therefore , finding a period in the _ kepler _ data which is close to the orbital period of the satellite is suspicious .",
    "if one would like to use _ kepler _ light curves to find periods of real physical processes close to the orbital period of the satellite , one would have to look at all k giants in the field and detrend them using a program like sys - rem @xcite .",
    "such systematic detrending would be useful for hd  175370 , however , it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we have looked at _ kepler _ light curves of all 41 giant stars from our sample which we follow from tautenburg and mercator and which have corrected timeseries by the kasc data analysis team .",
    "76 per cent of targets show the dominant period of @xmath25 , implying that the orbital period of the _ kepler _ satellite can be really seen in the relative photometry of most of the giant stars .",
    "7 per cent show the second dominant period of @xmath26 .",
    "finally , 17 per cent of targets show dominant periods which are clearly related to real physical processes and are not close to the orbital period of the satellite .",
    "both periods of 389.4 d and 370 d are also similar to the planetary orbital period of 349.5 d. we subtracted a linear trend from the photometric data shown in the second panel from the top of fig .",
    "[ plot5 ] and phase - folded them to the orbital period of the planet .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ plot10 ] , where the black dashed curve connects average values of the relative flux in bins of width 0.1 in phase .",
    "there is a modulation with an amplitude of about 0.0021 mag .",
    "the photometric time series cover nearly 3.5 planetary orbits .",
    "a careful look reveals that during the first two planetary orbits when photometric data were taken , photometric and rv variations agree quite well in phase , and only since the third orbit photometric and rv variations differ from each other ( see fig .",
    "[ plot10 ] ) .",
    "we have also phased the rv data to both photometric periods of 389.4  d and 370  d , and results are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot11 ] .",
    "the solid curve represents a best fit allowing periastron epoch and semi - amplitude of the rv curve to vary and assuming a constant period and zero eccentricity .",
    "it can be seen that the rv data do not phase well with the photometric periods 370 and 389.4 d , having the scatter of rv residuals 63.6 and 75.4@xmath6 , respectively . even though the above is not a proof that the rv period is unrelated to the photometric periods",
    ", there is no evidence to contradict this when taking into account that the _ kepler _ photometry is suspicious for periods close to the orbital period of the satellite .",
    "in addition , a stellar rotation period is expected to be shorter than the period of the planetary candidate . with the measured projected rotational velocity of @xmath27 and the radius of @xmath28 ( rgb star ) and @xmath29 ( agb star ) ,",
    "the expected upper limit for the stellar rotation period is 194@xmath30 d and 199@xmath31 d , respectively .",
    "it is unlikely that the 349.5-d rv period represents the rotation period of the star .",
    "assuming it did , this would result in a _ maximum _",
    "projected rotational velocity of 3.4 @xmath32 0.5 @xmath33 ( rgb star ) and 3.5 @xmath32 0.5 @xmath33 ( agb star ) , or nearly a factor of two smaller than our measured @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , if the apparent sinusoidal photometric variations in the second panel from the top in fig .  [ plot5 ] are due to cool spots , they can not explain the observed rv variation .",
    "the amplitude of the photometric variations is @xmath12  0.21 per cent .",
    "this results in a spot - induced rv amplitude of @xmath12  11 ms@xmath35 @xcite , or more than a factor of ten smaller than the observed @xmath36-amplitude .",
    "stellar rotational modulations of inhomogeneous surface features can create variable asymmetries in the spectral line profiles . the best way to describe",
    "this asymmetry is with the line bisector , which consists of the midpoints of horizontal line segments extending across the line profile . in a typical case , due to stellar granulation ,",
    "the red wing of the stellar line is depressed , which causes the bisector to have a positive slope and curve to the right near the continuum level .",
    "we used the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the hermesdrs data reduction pipeline to calculate bisectors ( see fig .",
    "[ plot7 ] ) .",
    "our ccf is typically based on @xmath121650 spectral lines for each spectrum and this results in a very good accuracy for the bisector measurement .",
    "we are interested in relative and not absolute bisector measurements and according to @xcite , the use of the average of many lines is appropriate for studying variations of line bisectors with time ( see also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best way to detect bisector changes is to calculate the bisector velocity span ( bvs ) , which is the difference between bisectors at two different flux levels of a spectral line . as in @xcite , we measured the bvs of the profile using the difference of the average bisector values between flux levels of 0.1  0.3 and 0.7  0.9 of the continuum value , therefore avoiding the spectral core and wing , where errors of the bisector measurements are larger . to estimate errors of bisectors",
    "we have used a formula of @xcite , who modified the expression given by @xcite .",
    "errors of our bvs measurements were then calculated by adding quadratically the errors for the top and bottom zones of the bisector measurements .",

    "8662    is not contaminated by atmospheric lines near the core .",
    "additionally , mercator spectra are contaminated by a light leak from the calibration fibre into the science fibre as displayed on the ccd in spectral regions containing bright calibration lines , but the region around the 8662   line is free from the contamination . according to @xcite ,",

    "no carbon depletion or oxygen enhancement was detected in high - resolution spectra indicating that hd  175370 is a low - mass star , where hydrogen burning occurred in a radiative core , dominated by the proton - proton reactions so that the cno cycle did not play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "based on the gbm code @xcite , we deduce that hd  175370 is most likely a rgb or agb star , and not a rc star .",
    "we conclude that the rv variations of hd  175370 are caused by a low - mass stellar companion with an orbital period of @xmath4 years in a highly eccentric orbit and a possible planetary companion with an orbital period @xmath37 , eccentricity @xmath38 , and a semi - amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "our interpretation of the rv changes in terms of a planet is supported by the lack of variability in the spectral line bisectors , _ kepler _ light curve , and the lack of chromospheric activity corresponding to the orbital period of the planet .",

    "however , even the lack of stellar variability in stellar activity indicators corresponding to the orbital period of the planet do not prove its existence .",
    "one caveat is 42  dra which has been claimed to host a planetary companion @xcite .",
    "our continued rv measurements of 42  dra show that in the past three years the amplitude of the orbital motion decreased by a factor of four ( hatzes et al .",

    "this casts serious doubts on the planet hypothesis for the rv variations . when the rv amplitude was high there were no variations in h@xmath40 , the spectral line bisectors , or in the _ hipparcos _ photometry . in this case",
    "the standard tools for planet confirmation - the same ones that we use for hd 175370 - failed .",
    "we suggest that measurements of such standard activity indicators may not be sufficient and that long - term monitoring is essential in order to confirm planets around k - giant stars .",
    "we note that we do not see any variations in the rv amplitude of the orbital motion due to hd  175370  b. the star 42  dra showed coherent rv variations with a constant amplitude over three years .",
    "the rv variations in hd  175370 are constant for more than five years .",
    "we found two periods in the _ kepler _ light curves of 389.4  d and 370  d. both of them are very close to the orbital period of the satellite , 372.5  d. we have shown that most of the _ kepler _ giant stars from our sample show the dominant period of @xmath41 , which agrees with the orbital period of the _ kepler _ satellite within the 1-@xmath42 error bars .",
    "we therefore believe that finding a period in the _ kepler _ photometry which is close to the orbital period of the satellite is suspicious and should not be related to a real physical process unless one looks at all k giants in the field and detrends them systematically . even though we can not prove that the rv period is unrelated to the photometric periods , there is no evidence about the opposite",
    ". continued rv monitoring of this system may help answer this uncertainty .    a possible explanation of the rv changes observed for hd  175370 could be an unknown envelope pulsation causing photometric and spurious keplerian - like rv variations .",
    "@xcite found among 13 low - metallicity giants three cases where small amplitude variations ( @xmath36 ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 @xmath33 ) with periods very close to 1 year are superimposed on a long - period keplerian orbit .",
    "they do not give a conclusive answer on the origin of these variations , but leave an envelope pulsation as an option .",
    "in choosing a hypothesis based on a known phenomenon ( exoplanets ) as opposed to an unknown phenomenon ( envelope oscillations ) we chose the former until more evidence comes to light .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the photometric periods we have found in the _ kepler _ light curves of hd  175370 are suspicious of being due to the orbital period of the satellite .",
    "oscillation modes dominate the short time - scale variations in the light curve and their amplitudes are at least ten times larger than the expected transit depth",
    ". it would therefore be difficult to detect any transit events in the light curve , which would constrain the orbital inclination .",
    "hd  175370 is one of the few close binary systems to host a giant planetary candidate and thus may be important for understanding planet formation in binary systems . to date , only about six binary systems with separations less than 25  au have been found to host giant planets @xcite . with a binary orbital separation of 22  au hd  175370",
    "adds to this small list .",
    "hd  175370 is unique in that it has the largest binary eccentricity ( @xmath43 = 0.88 ) of these binary systems hosting planetary candidates . at closest approach",
    "the primary - secondary separation is only a factor of 2.7 larger than the planet - star semi - major axis .",
    "however , we fixed the orbital period and eccentricity of the binary orbit to values obtained from varying these parameters separately and searched for a minimum in the residuals , and therefore the errors of both parameters are expected to be large , which also implies a large error on the orbital separation .",
    "we estimate that uncertainties of the period and eccentricity are @xmath124000 d and @xmath120.02 , respectively , which implies that at closest approach the primary - secondary separation could be a factor of 3.5 larger than the planet - star semi - major axis .",
    "a dynamical study may place additional constraints on the age and future evolution of this system .",
    "hd  175370  b is one of the first planetary candidates discovered around a _ kepler _",
    "giant star via the rv method .",
    "unlike for other evolved giant stars with extrasolar planets detected by ground - based rv surveys , for hd  175370 we have high - quality _ kepler _ photometry from which we can determine the stellar mass and radius in a more or less model independent way .",
    "the relative uncertainties of our derived stellar mass , stellar radius , and @xmath21 are 16 , 14 , and 1 per cent , respectively .",
    "hd  175370 is a relatively old star with an age of at least 5.4 gyrs .",
    "more discoveries of planets around evolved giant stars can give us a better understanding of the mass dependence of planet formation and the evolution of planetary systems .",
