    "satellite ( e.g. , swanenburg et al.1981 ) . observations with _",
    "egret showed that this source ( 2egj2020 + 4026 = 3egj2020 + 4017 = gevj2020 + 4023 ) , whose photon flux is @xmath11 1.2 @xmath12 above 100 mev ( sturner & dermer 1995 ; hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , is the brightest among apparently steady unidentified egret sources .",
    "_ whipple _  telescope observations ( e.g. , buckley et al .  1998 ) have established an upper limit of 2.2 @xmath13 for the flux above 300 gev , indicating a break in the spectrum above a few gev .",
    "bykov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that the egret and sources could be the @xmath9-ray and hard x - ray counterparts of the same source in , e.g. , a geminga - like pulsar or extended emission from particles accelerated in the supernova ejecta / shell .",
    "in particular , the interaction of the wind of the early type o9v star hd 193322 , located just 7  from igr j2018 + 4043 , with  would be a plausible mechanism of particle acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , the  source position within the snr field does not necessarily imply their physical connection .",
    "an example of such a confusion is the source igr j172043554 projected onto the rich galactic starforming region ngc 6334 .",
    "the most likely identification of that source is a highly obscured extragalactic object ngc 6334b ( see bassani et al .  2005 ; bykov et al .",

    "2003 ) , a reliable identification of the relatively weak ( 45 @xmath14 ) isgrisource requires high - resolution observations with other instruments .",

    "the accurate positioning of the _ swift _ source allowed us to find its possible radio / ir / optical counterparts in archival data (  2.3 and  2.4 ) .",

    "we used 1.5 ms of isgri  good time archival fcfov data taken at revolutions 19255 ( 2002 dec 9  2005 nov 16 ) .",
    "we applied the selection criteria taking only the science windows where the count rate was within @xmath15 around the mean value determined by the whole 1.5 ms exposure .",
    "the standard reduction was performed with the osa 5.1 software @xcite .",
    "pixel spreading was switched off for a more accurate flux estimation .",

    "the source was detected with a flux of ( 1.2@xmath160.2 ) @xmath1710@xmath18 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 in the 20 - 40 kev band , and ( 1.4@xmath160.4)@xmath1710@xmath18 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 in the 40 - 80 kev band , obtained by cross calibration with the crab ( see , e.g. , lubinski et al .",
    "2004 ) . the flux in 20- 40 kev band is below that quoted in bykov ( 2004 ) due to the new background model used in osa 5 and more conservative selection criteria that we applied now to the much longer exposure dataset available .",

    "the radio image at 1.4 ghz was produced from vla archival data obtained in d configuration on 1996 sep 19 .",
    "the data were processed with the miriad software following standard procedures .",

    "the total flux density of the radio feature is about 480 mjy .",
    "the resolution in d configuration is too low to resolve a possible point source within the structured extended feature .",
    "overall , we can not rule out the possibilty that the radio source is a counterpart of j2018 , although the connection is not very certain yet .",
    "having the position of j2018 well constrained by the _",
    "swift_observations , we looked for counterparts of the x - ray source in archival optical and ir data .",
    "we found a likely counterpart , with the flux of 88@xmath169 mjy at 8.28 @xmath39 m , in the 6th msx catalog @xcite at @xmath19 = 20@xmath2018@xmath2139@xmath221 , @xmath40 ( about @xmath41 positional accuracy ) .",
    "we also found an extended nir source centered at @xmath19 = 20@xmath4218@xmath2138@xmath2273 , @xmath23 = + 40@xmath2441@xmath2500@xmath261 ( 26 from the _ swift _ position ) in the 2mass xsc catalog @xcite , with magnitudes @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "these magnitudes are brighter than reported by kennea et al.(2006 ) because those authors did not account for source extension .    the optical images , taken from the poss - ii survey @xcite , are also shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "a counterpart to j2018 can be seen in the poss - red ( 5878 - 7121  ) and poss - ir ( 6939 - 9030  ) filters at the same position as the 2mass source , and with a similar spatial extent .",

    "we estimated @xmath46 and @xmath47 via aperture count - rate calculations .",
    "the absence of the source in the poss - ii blue image yields an upper limit @xmath48 .",
    "the aperture boundaries were set at the count rate corresponding to half a difference between the brightest source pixel value and the local background level .",
    "two reference stars in each band were used to estimate the zero - point and the count - rate vs.  magnitude dependence .",
    "the same local background was subtracted from all the count rates , normalized by the aperture size . to convert the magnitudes into fluxes",
    ", we used the @xmath49 and poss - ii magnitudes of the standard secondary spectrophotometric objects hz4 and g191b2b @xcite and obtained @xmath50jy , @xmath51 mjy , @xmath52 = 0.76 mjy for the optical source .",
    "we estimate the error of the cross - calibration , about 20% , to be mainly due to the extended nature of the source .",
    "the _ swift_-isgri spectrum of j2018 shows that it is a nonthermal , highly obscured source .",
    "the hydrogen column density estimated from the _ swift _ data (  2.2 ) looks too high for an object in the  snr ( @xmath53 kpc , expected @xmath54@xmath55 @xmath3 ; landecker et al . 1980 ) .",
    "j2018 is likely a more distant object , not associated with .",
    "a number of isgri sources have been identified as galactic x - ray binaries , mostly hmxbs ( e.g. , filliarte & chaty 2004 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the j2018 s x - ray spectrum (  2.2 ) and luminosity , @xmath56 ergs s@xmath4 in 180 kev range , as well as the magnitudes of the ir - optical counterpart (  2.4 ) do not contradict such an interpretation .",
    "the apparent @xmath11@xmath57 extension of the optical and 2mass counterparts could be associated with a powerful wind of an hmxb s o or b companion .",
    "alternatively , the extended ir - optical source could be interpreted as a galaxy that hosts an agn detected in x - rays .",
    "an extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum of j2018 into the egret range reaches the flux level of gev j2020 + 4023 , which suggests that these sources could be x - ray and @xmath9-ray counterparts of the same object .",
    "an extensive dedicated search for a counterpart to 3eg j2020 + 4017 with  and the green bank radio telescope in a close vicinity of its nominal position failed to show any clear candidate object ( becker et al .  2004 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "however , j2018 is located outside the fields of these searches .",
    "the position of j2018 is 306 ( 355 ) offset from the nominal position of gev j2020 + 4023 ( 3eg j2020 + 4017 ) , exceeding the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) 95% localization accuracy in those catalogs ( lamb & macomb 1997 ; hartman et al .",
    ". however , such offsets are not unusual among egret sources .",
    "the position accuracy of relatively faint egret sources in the galactic plane was estimated by gehrels et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as @xmath11@xmath60 .",
    "moreover , even the very bright vela and geminga pulsars are located outside their egret 99% confidence contours ( see hartman et al .",
    "3eg j2020 + 4017 is a bright source , but it is located in a very crowded region of the plane , with enhanced , highly inhomogeneous diffuse emission from the  snr and nearby molecular clouds , and at least two other egret sources ( 3eg j2021 + 3716 and j2016 + 3657 ) within the 3@xmath61 vicinity , which may have affected the source localization . in such an environment , systematic uncertainties can increase the localization error up to @xmath1105 . thus , despite the positional discrepancy , we believe that one can consider the possibility that _ swift_-isgri and egret detected the same source .",
    "future _ glast _",
    "( e.g. , gehrels & michelson 1999 ) observation could resolve the issue .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the @xmath62 detection of a possible fe k@xmath63 feature at 6.2 kev in the _ rxte _ spectrum of  ( bykov et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the feature , which could be attributed to a putative hidden accreting source ( e.g. , an agn ) , does not appear in the _ asca _ spectra of the  regions observed by this satellite , which did not include the j2018 position , while this position was well within the _ rxte _ collimator field .    to investigate the nature of j2018",
    ", we constructed its spectral energy distribution ( sed ; fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) using the  and  observations and the archival data described above .",
    "it should be noted that the data are noncontemporaneous , which is a point of some concern because the source could be variable . the galactic absorption ( @xmath64 )",
    "was accounted for in the unabsorbed nir - optical spectrum using the reddening maps by @xcite .",
    "being rather accurate for high latitude sources , the method often overestimates the reddening by a factor of up to 1.5 for strongly reddenned objects ( arce & goodman 1999 ) .",
    "the optical emission is apparently extended , but with the data available it is not possible to disentangle the core component , corresponding to the point source detected by _ swift _ , from the extended halo .",
    "therefore , the optical points can be lower than shown in figure 3 , and the extinction corrected ( with @xmath65 ) optical fluxes in figure [ fig3 ] should be regarded as upper limits , because of a possible overestimation ( up to 3 mag ) in the @xmath66 used .",
    "the hypothesis that the 1.4ghz vla excess is due to a point - like source at the  source position ( e.g. , an agn ) projected onto an extended radio source is not in conflict with the data available .",
    "therefore , we conditionally include the vla point , as well as the egret data , in figure 3 . within a more conservative approach",
    ", they should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "the radio through hard x - ray sed in figure [ fig3 ] is consistent with that expected for a nearby seyfert agn or a radio - galaxy ( e.g. , dermer & gehrels 1995 ) .",
    "for instance , at @xmath67 the source luminosity below 100 kev would be about @xmath68 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "if gev j2020 + 4023 is indeed associated with j2018 , then the radio through @xmath9-ray source could be a blazar . given the @xmath66 uncertainties discussed above , the multiwavelength spectrum resembles the two - peak synchrotron self - compton sed of s5 0716 + 714 , a blazar studied by foschini ( 2006 ) .",
    "simultaneous multiwavelength observations are required , however , to verify the blazar hypothesis and understand the processes responsible for such a spectrum . on the other hand , the leptonic jet model for a microquasar , such as discussed by dermer & bttcher ( 2006 ) for ls 5039 , also provides a sed generally consistent with that given in figure 3 .",
    "nir and optical spectroscopy could distinguish between the two interpretations by measuring the redshift of the galaxy that hosts the putative agn .",
    "also , microquasars are usually variable on minutes scale , while agns are variable on longer time scales making a variability study conclusive .",
    "the analysis given above allows us to conclude that the properties of the source discovered by _ swift _",
    "are consistent with those of .",
    "however , that does not exclude a sizable extended hard x - ray flux from the possible interaction of the  snr with stellar winds as discussed by bykov et al .",
    "the extended vla feature seen in figure 1 can also be attributed to the snr - wind interaction .",
    "high - resolution observations with  and , as well as simultaneous multiwavelength studies , are needed to separate the components and to make a firm conclusion on the nature of igr j2018 + 4043 .",
