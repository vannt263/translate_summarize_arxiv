    "an important application is the use of cold molecules for testing fundamental laws of physics @xcite .",
    "cold molecules are being used to test the standard model of particle physics and its extensions via a measurement of the electron s electric dipole moment @xcite .",
    "they can also be used to test the time invariance of the fine structure constant and of the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xcite , test lorentz invariance @xcite , and measure parity - violating interactions in nuclei @xcite and in chiral molecules @xcite .",
    "buffer gas cooling is a very versatile way of producing high densities of atoms and molecules at temperatures down to a few hundred millikelvin @xcite .",
    "the molecules are introduced into a cryogenically - cooled cell where they thermalize with a cold buffer gas .",
    "the buffer gas is usually helium , though neon has also been used @xcite .",
    "the molecules can be brought into the cell in a number of ways , depending on their vapour pressure and reactivity .",
    "methods that have been demonstrated include laser ablation of a precursor target e.g. @xcite , injection through a capillary e.g. @xcite , loading from a molecular beam e.g. @xcite , and direct gas flow loading e.g. @xcite .    once loaded , there are three main options available . in the simplest case",
    "the molecules are allowed to diffuse freely to the cell walls , where they will stick , and measurements are made on the molecules in the interval of time between loading and sticking .",
    "this method has been used to measure molecular parameters by millimetre and submillimetre spectroscopic techniques @xcite , and more recently by laser spectroscopy , e.g. @xcite .",
    "elastic and inelastic collision cross - sections can also be measured this way , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a second approach is to trap the molecules magnetically by placing the cell inside a strong magnetic trapping field and pumping away the helium as soon as the molecules are cold @xcite .",
    "the coldest molecules are then confined in the magnetic trap .",
    "several molecular species have been trapped this way , @xcite , allowing elastic collision and zeeman relaxation rates to be measured at low temperatures , @xcite .",
    "trapping times of 20s have been demonstrated for nh molecules @xcite .",
    "a third approach is to extract the molecules from the cell to make a high intensity cold beam @xcite which could then be used in a molecular beam experiment or for trapping .",
    "the molecules that form the beam can be guided away from the cell and separated from the helium using a magnetic guide @xcite , an electrostatic guide @xcite or an alternating gradient electric guide @xcite .",
    "it is important to have a good understanding of the processes that occur inside the buffer gas cell , since this is the starting point for all experiments whether they be done directly inside the cell , in a magnetic trap loaded from the cell , or in a beam extracted from the cell . in this paper",
    "we focus on the formation , diffusion and thermalization of ybf molecules produced by laser ablation of a target inside a closed helium buffer gas cell .",
    "these molecules are of particular interest for the measurement of the electron s electric dipole moment @xcite and , for that application , the formation of a high density of ybf is one of our aims",
    ". the work presented here will be applicable to many other buffer gas cooling experiments , particularly those where laser ablation is the loading method or where laser spectroscopy is used to make measurements inside the cell .",
    "figure [ fig : experimentsetup ] shows a few details of the experiment . to make the cell we took a solid aluminium cube of side 40 mm and bored three orthogonal 20 mm diameter holes , two passing all the way through the cell and the other half way through .",
    "the face without a hole mounts onto the cold plate of a liquid helium cryostat ( infrared laboratories , model hd3 ) .",
    "vacuum - tight indium seals close the five open faces , three with windows and two with blanks .",
    "one window is used for laser ablation of a target placed on the opposite side of the cell and the other two are used for laser absorption spectroscopy and imaging of the molecules formed inside .",
    "the cryostat is pumped by a turbomolecular pump to a pressure of approximately 10@xmath2 mbar . a radiation shield , in thermal contact with a liquid nitrogen dewar , surrounds the setup and prevents room temperature radiation from reaching the cold surfaces .",

    "the ablation pulses have a duration of 8ns , an energy of approximately 50mj , a wavelength of 1064 nm , and a spot size at the target of 2 mm .",
    "helium gas enters the cell through a hole beneath the target , via a thin - walled tube of inner diameter 2.5 mm .",
    "this is in two parts : a stainless steel tube for most of the length is connected to a copper tube near the cold plate of the cryostat . to ensure that the gas is cold when it enters the cell , the copper tubing winds around , and is silver - soldered to , a copper bobbin connected to the cold plate . at the room temperature end , outside the cryostat",
    ", the feed tube is connected to a chamber where the helium pressure is measured and controlled .",
    "the helium enters this chamber through a leak valve and is pumped away to a rotary pump through a second valve .",
    "these two valves provide fine control over the helium pressure , which is measured by a pirani gauge .",
    "when the cell is cold , there is a thermomolecular pressure drop between the two ends of the tube , and we account for this using the empirical formula given in @xcite .",
    "even when the cell is at room temperature , it is not immediately clear whether the pressure measured at the inlet end of the feed tube is the same as the pressure in the cell . to investigate this",
    ", we temporarily connected a second pirani gauge directly to the cell , via a port in the cryostat usually used as a window .",
    "both pressure gauges were calibrated to a third gauge which , for helium , is accurate to 0.5% .",
    "figure [ fig : pgraph ] shows the pressure in the cell versus the pressure at the inlet .",
    "one set of measurements was taken during ablation of the target at 10hz , another set a few minutes after stopping the ablation , and a final set after pumping the cell through the gas feed tube for about 12 hours .",
    "the figure shows that the cell pressure is equal to the inlet pressure plus a constant offset .",
    "the offset is due to outgassing of the target which raises the total pressure in the cell .",
    "this outgassing is greatest during ablation of the target , when the offset is @xmath4 mbar .",
    "when the ablation is stopped the offset falls with two separate timescales .",
    "first it falls quickly , reaching a steady value of @xmath5 mbar in a few minutes , and then it falls much more slowly , reaching @xmath6 mbar after about 12 hours .",
    "we could only make these direct pressure measurements at room temperature , so we do not know how the offset changes with temperature . the pressure offset has implications for some of our measurements , and we will highlight these where relevant .",

    "however , temperature measurements of the fully thermalized molecules ( sec.[sec : thermalisation ] ) indicate that the cell is about 10k hotter than the cold plate , presumably due to insufficient thermal conduction between the two .",
    "we have also used the doppler broadening of the atomic yb spectrum to determine the temperature , and this agrees with the results obtained from the molecules . using a new experimental setup , where the thermal conduction is improved , we find that the molecules do indeed reach the same temperature as the 4k cell . all the measurements reported here were done with the earlier apparatus and we use the temperature of the molecules as the most reliable measure of the cell temperature .",
    "all the measurements presented in this paper are based on absorption of a cw probe laser beam .",
    "light from a dye laser is used to address individual rotational lines within the ( 00 ) band of the @xmath7@xmath8 transition of ybf , at a wavelength of 552 nm .",
    "the laser frequency is measured with an accuracy of approximately 600mhz using a wavemeter ( highfinesse ws6 ) .",
    "absorption images reveal the spatial distribution of the molecules as a function of time . for these measurements",
    ", the laser beam passes through a 100mhz acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) acting as a fast optical shutter , and is then collimated and expanded to a diameter of 20 mm .",
    "this beam passes through the buffer gas cell and onto a ccd camera ( marlin f033b ) .",
    "the shortest exposure time offered by this camera is 34@xmath9s . to take images with higher time resolution",
    ", we use the aom to turn on the absorption imaging beam for a period of 10@xmath9s . for time - resolved measurements of the ybf density , translational temperature and rotational temperature at a specific point in the cell",
    ", we use a combination of doppler - limited and doppler - free absorption spectroscopy , using 1 mm diameter pump , probe and reference beams , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "data are taken at a repetition rate of 10hz , synchronised to the 50hz line frequency to suppress the effects of line noise in the experiment . in the imaging experiments the laser frequency",
    "is fixed and each shot yields one image from the ccd camera . in the spectroscopy experiments ,",
    "the outputs of the photodiodes are recorded for 8ms with a sample rate of 250khz , and the laser frequency is stepped between one shot and the next . as described in @xcite , the absorption of a fixed frequency probe beam from a second dye laser is used for normalization purposes , factoring out the slow drift in ablation yield that occurs as the target degrades .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] shows a sequence of absorption images for three different buffer gas densities at a cell temperature of 20k . to obtain each image",
    ", we take the difference between two pictures , one where the ablation laser fires and one where it does not .",
    "the field of view is 20 mm wide and the colour represents the fractional absorption of the probe laser .",
    "the target is on the left side of the image , just outside the field of view .",
    "the probe laser is tuned near the p - branch bandhead where there is a high density of overlapping spectral lines from rotational states in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the camera is exposed to the probe for 10@xmath9s with a variable delay relative to the q - switch of the ablation laser .",
    "the images therefore show how the density of ybf molecules in low - lying rotational states evolves with time , and how this depends on the buffer gas density .        in fig.[fig :",
    "images](a ) , the helium density is relatively low , @xmath11m@xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the molecules fill the entire field of view within 30@xmath9s .",
    "their distribution is roughly uniform in all the images .",
    "the overall absorption increases for the first 180@xmath9s , and then slowly decreases after that .",
    "we propose that the molecules are formed close to the target , then expand ballistically , and because their mean free path is relatively long at this density , they rapidly fill the entire cell .",
    "they then diffuse slowly to the walls , where they stick .",
    "the increase in absorption over the first 180@xmath9s suggests either that the formation of new molecules continues for this length of time , or that the rotational temperature starts out high and cools on this timescale , thereby increasing the population of the low - lying rotational states being probed in the experiment .",
    "the measurements presented in sec.[sec : thermalisation ] confirm that the rotational temperature does indeed fall considerably over this initial period .",
    "in the first frame of the sequence of images hardly any molecules are visible because they are too hot during this initial 10@xmath9s period to be observed . in fig.[fig : images](b ) the helium density is increased to @xmath12m@xmath1 , and the evolution has changed considerably . the initial ballistic expansion is arrested before the molecules have filled the cell , so that in the first frame we see the projection of a hemispherical distribution with a radius of about 8 mm .",
    "this distribution then diffuses slowly into the rest of the cell .",
    "the absorption peaks after about 60@xmath9s , indicating that the rotational cooling is faster than before .",
    "we might expect the decay of the molecule density to be slower than before because the diffusion will be slower at higher helium density , but in fact the density appears to decay more rapidly .",
    "this is even more evident in fig.[fig : images](c ) where the helium density is increased to @xmath13m@xmath1 . here",
    ", the ballistic expansion is arrested even closer to the target , the peak absorption occurs at even earlier times , and the propagation into the rest of the cell is even slower .",
    "after 540@xmath9s the molecules have still not filled the entire field of view , and yet most of the molecules have vanished .",
    "the rapid decay of the signal is partly due to the proximity of the molecules to the walls of the cell .",
    "the target is close to the wall , and the molecules are stopped close to the target , so the distance that they have to diffuse before they reach a wall is small .",
    "this tends to lower their survival time in the cell , even though the mean free path is small .",
    "other loss processes may also be contributing to the decay of the molecular density .",
    "the ybf molecules and other ablation products are confined at high density and the ybf radicals may react with these other atoms and molecules to form more stable products .",
    "we investigate the decay times of the molecules more quantitatively in the next section .",
    "we have studied the diffusion of the ybf molecules through the helium buffer gas . in order to obtain an estimate of the ybf - he diffusion cross - section , without needing an accurate measure of the helium density in the cell , we produce and probe lithium atoms in the cell simultaneously with the ybf molecules .",
    "the li - he diffusion cross - section can be calculated accurately , and so the li diffusion times provide a good reference against which the ybf diffusion times can be compared .",
    "following ablation , there is an initial ballistic expansion of molecules away from the target . over a certain distance from the target , depending inversely on the helium pressures ,",
    "this ballistic expansion is arrested and the molecules then diffuse towards the walls .",
    "the flux of diffusing particles , @xmath14 , is proportional to the gradient of the density @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "for diffusion of one gas into another at temperature @xmath17 , the relationship between the diffusion coefficient , @xmath18 , and the thermally averaged diffusion cross - section , @xmath19 , is given , with sufficient accuracy , by the first chapman - enskog approximation @xcite .",
    "since the number density of helium , @xmath20 , is many orders of magnitude larger than that of our diffusing gas , the result is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced mass related to the masses of the helium , @xmath23 , and the diffusing molecules , @xmath24 .",
    "although this expression is only the first term of a series approximation for the diffusion coefficient , it is expected to be accurate to better than 2% for the two cases , li - he and ybf - he , that we consider here @xcite .    the density of molecules in their journey through time and space is described by the time dependent diffusion equation @xmath25 . the solution can be written in the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the amplitude of the diffusion mode @xmath28 , which for a homogeneous diffusion coefficient is a solution of the differential equation @xmath29 subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the walls . since the molecules stick to the walls with high probability , we take @xmath30 at the walls . when there is no particular symmetry in the problem , three indices are needed to label the diffusion modes , represented here by the single label @xmath31 . in all cases ,",

    "the interaction potential for li - he is well established , there being a long history of theoretical and experimental work on this system ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath43 for a range of temperatures using the potential given in reference @xcite .",
    "the results at 293 , 80 and 20k are given in table [ tab : cross - sections ] on page .",
    "there are two sources of error in this calculation .",
    "the first is due to our neglect of quantum effects . using the tabulation in @xcite",
    ", we estimate that quantum effects increase the cross - section by about 2% at 20k , and are negligible at the higher temperatures .",
    "the second source of error is due to the uncertainty in the interaction potential . to estimate this we repeated the calculations using the alternative potential given in @xcite .",
    "the cross - sections obtained from this latter potential are smaller by 0.3% at 293k , 5% at 80k and 6% at 20k . taking these differences as indicative of the likely accuracy , we assign a fractional uncertainty of 5% to the cross - sections calculated at all temperatures . the interaction potential for ybf",
    "- he has also been calculated @xcite and we use this to obtain theoretical values for @xmath44 at these same temperatures . in this case , the potential is not only a function of the ybf - he separation but also of the angle between the ybf internuclear axis and the incident velocity vector of the collision .",
    "we calculate an approximate diffusion cross - section by calculating the cross - section as a function of this angle and then averaging over all angles .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : cross - sections ] .",

    "this model uses the same cell geometry as the experiment and only accounts for diffusion",
    ". it does not include the initial momentum away from the target that the molecules have following ablation . for low helium densities",
    ", this initial momentum helps to distribute the molecules throughout the cell faster than diffusion would be able to do . to understand the effect of this , we study two extreme cases for the initial condition in the model . in one case ,",

    "the behaviour seen in these simulated images is qualitatively similar to that of the experimental absorption images shown in fig.[fig : images ] . in fig.[fig : simulatedimages](a ) the initial density distribution is a constant .",
    "this evolves to a distribution with a maximum at the middle , and that distribution then decays away slowly . in fig.[fig : simulatedimages](b ) the initial density is localized close to the target , and we see that as time progresses the distribution expands slowly away from the target but decays away on a faster timescale than in case ( a ) .",
    "this is because the molecules are localized close to the target and so can diffuse back onto the target and the nearby wall .",
    "the diffusion equation tells us that high spatial gradients in density decay away rapidly .",
    "the highly localized initial distribution is represented by high - order diffusion modes localized close to the target , and these decay away quickly with a large fraction of the molecules quickly reaching the target and nearby wall , leaving only low - order modes whose amplitudes are so small that they are barely visible in the images .    as well as taking absorption images , we measure the absorption locally using a small probe laser . to simulate these measurements ,",
    "we integrate the simulated density over the volume of the probe laser .",
    "doing this , we find that the time evolution of the density is sensitive to the position of the probe , and to the initial condition , as shown in fig.[fig : modeldiffusiontimes ] . in this figure , we plot the simulated time evolution of the density probed at three different distances from the target , as well as the evolution of the density averaged over the whole cell . with reference to the coordinate system shown in fig.[fig : experimentsetup ] , the probe laser is in the @xmath51-plane , displaced along @xmath52 . in each case",

    "taking derivatives with respect to the scaled spatial coordinates the diffusion equation is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a dimensionless time .",
    "this is the time axis we use in fig.[fig : modeldiffusiontimes ] because this makes it obvious how the results scale with the overall size of the cell and with the diffusion coefficient ( and hence the diffusion cross - section , helium density and temperature ) .    in the case where the initial density distribution is uniform [ fig.[fig : modeldiffusiontimes](a ) ]",
    ", the time evolution does not depend strongly on position .",
    "there are some differences in the time evolution for different beam position at very early times , but after that the evolution is well described by a single exponential decay with a time constant which is the same at all positions .",
    "for our cell , this time constant is found to be @xmath61 , where @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient in m@xmath47s@xmath48 and @xmath62 is in s. for example , for a helium density of @xmath63m@xmath1 , a ybf - he diffusion cross - section of @xmath49m@xmath47 and a temperature of 20k , the diffusion coefficient is @xmath64m@xmath47s@xmath48 , and the expected diffusion lifetime is @xmath65ms . for diffusion in a cube of side @xmath66 ,",
    "the time constant associated with the lowest order diffusion mode is @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that the diffusion time constant for our cell is the same as that of a cubic cell with @xmath68 cm .",
    "this is reassuringly similar to the size scale of our cell .",
    "the position sensitivity is far stronger when the molecules are initially concentrated near the target , as in fig.[fig : modeldiffusiontimes](b ) . while the initial density is largest close to the source of molecules , there is a rapid decay of the density at this position .",
    "as time goes on , the rate of decay slows down , and eventually the time evolution becomes a single exponential with the same time constant as in the constant density case .",
    "however , that does not occur until the density has fallen by two orders of magnitude . further away from the source ,",
    "the density first increases with time as the molecules arrive at the probe , and then it decreases again with the same time constant as in the constant density case .",
    "the peak density decreases as we move further from the target , and the time taken to reach this peak increases with increasing distance .",
    "we conclude that at long times the time evolution is insensitive to either the initial condition or the position of the probe , but that at short times it is sensitive to probe position particularly when the initial density is strongly localised .",
    "these observations can be explained by expressing the density distribution as a sum over a set of diffusion modes , the higher order modes representing more rapid spatial variations in density and decaying away more quickly .",
    "when the cell is uniformly filled , the density rapidly settles into the lowest order diffusion mode , which gives us the longest diffusion time . to represent an initial distribution that is strongly localized we need to put large amplitude into high - order modes , and these then decay away rapidly",
    "eventually , only the low - order modes , which persist for much longer , will remain , but the amplitude of the low - order mode may be very small . in an experiment , it may be too small to observe above the noise .    , where @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath58 cm is a characteristic size scale for the cell .",

    "this probe laser was overlapped with the ybf probe beam and the absorption signals for the two species were measured simultaneously on two separate photodiodes . in this way , both species were measured at the same place and at the same time , and both were produced in the same place on the target .",

    ", there is an initial fast rise in the density during the first 20@xmath9s as the atoms fill the cell .",
    "after that , the signal is described well by a double exponential decay , one exponential having a short time constant that dominates during the first 150@xmath9s , and the second having a longer time constant that dominates at later times .",
    "this same behaviour is observed over a wide range of buffer gas densities .",
    "we find that as the helium density increases the short time constant decreases from about 40@xmath9s when the density is @xmath75m@xmath1 to about 20@xmath9s when the density is @xmath76m@xmath1 .",
    "we suppose that this fast decay is the decay of higher - order diffusion modes , the result being sensitive to the initial condition and the position of the probe laser as discussed above .",
    "the long time constant on the other hand increases with buffer gas density , and we take this to be the characteristic diffusion time for li in the cell . the ybf absorption curves are influenced by both diffusion and by rotational cooling which , at early times , increases the relative population in the low - lying rotational states probed in the experiment , particularly for low cell temperatures . in sec.[sec : thermalisation ] we measure how the rotational temperature changes with time . a model that includes both diffusion and",

    "the error bars are determined from the scatter of repeated measurements taken under the same nominal conditions .",
    "they therefore appear as errors in the time constant though we believe the major source of the scatter to be due to the difficulty of setting the buffer gas density , which was very slow to reach equilibrium particularly at low temperatures . for low buffer gas densities , all the measured time constants increase linearly with density and both species diffuse more slowly at lower temperatures as expected in a simple model of diffusion .",
    "at both 293k and 20k the time constant for ybf increases more rapidly with increasing helium density than for li . at higher densities however , the diffusion times stop increasing and become roughly independent of the helium density .",
    "this behaviour is displayed by both ybf and li at 293k , by li at 80k and ybf at 20k .",
    "the data for li at 20k appear to show a more complicated behaviour at high density .",
    "for li , the lifetimes level off at approximately 400@xmath9s at 293k , 600@xmath9s at 80k , and roughly 500@xmath9s at 20k . for ybf ,",
    "the corresponding values are approximately 800@xmath9s at 293k and 1000@xmath9s at 20k .",
    "the density at which the levelling off occurs is about the same for the two species , and shifts to lower values as the temperature is lowered .        at low density ,",
    "the diffusion times show the expected linear increase with helium density , so we fit straight lines to the low density parts of the five datasets .",
    "the fit results are shown by the lines in fig.[fig : experimentaldiffusiontimes ] .",
    "for the 293k and 80k data , the first 10 data points were used for the linear fit . for the 20k data it is unclear whether to fit to the first 4 or first 5 data points ( the latter is shown in fig.[fig : experimentaldiffusiontimes](c ) ) , and so we do both .",
    "the gradients of these two fits are consistent within errors , and we take the mean value as our best estimate .",
    "the gradients of the linear fits , together with eq.([eq : sigma1sigma2 ] ) and the calculated li - he diffusion cross - section , provide a measurement of the ybf - he diffusion cross - section , @xmath44 .",
    "the results are given in the fourth column of table [ tab : cross - sections ] .",
    "the uncertainty is derived by adding in quadrature the statistical errors in the gradients of the linear fits , the error in the li - he cross - section estimated above , and in the case of the 20k result , half the difference between the gradients of the 4-point and 5-point fits . neither the helium density or the cell temperature enter in the determination of the cross - section .",
    "errors arising due to a difference in the initial spatial distribution of the li and ybf or small displacements of the two probes are deemed to be negligible because at these helium densities the initial ballistic expansion fills the cell , as in fig.[fig : images](a ) , and our simulation results indicate that the diffusion time is insensitive to the exact initial distribution or probe position in this case .",
    "errors arising due to a difference in temperature between the two species are also negligible because the time for thermalization with the helium is much smaller than the characteristic diffusion time ( see sec.[sec : thermalisation ] ) .",
    "our experimental values for the ybf - he diffusion cross - section are consistent with our theoretical values .",
    "in particular , the values are in agreement at 293k where the experimental uncertainty is smallest .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     extrapolating the data to zero helium density as shown by the lines in fig.[fig : experimentaldiffusiontimes ]",
    "we observe an offset in all of the lifetimes .",
    "this suggests that the ablation process itself puts a significant density of material in the cell which the ybf and li then have to diffuse through .",
    "this is consistent with the offset observed in fig.[fig : pgraph ] .",
    "the offset is smaller for the li data at 80k .",
    "we do not know the reason for this .",
    "we speculate that , when the cell is warm , vacuum contaminants such as water and hydrocarbons reach the cell and are absorbed into the target , and when the cell is very cold the target absorbs helium just like a cryo - sorb . at 80k neither occur because this is not cold enough to absorb helium but is too cold for water and hydrocarbons to reach the cell .",
    "we have used the li data to calibrate the ybf data and so our determination of the ybf - he diffusion cross - section does not rely on the diffusion model or on knowing the helium density .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to compare the experimental results at low density with the predictions of the diffusion model for li .",
    "we assume that at low helium densities , the cell is immediately filled with a uniform density of particles .",
    "fitting a sum of two exponentials to the results of the model with this initial condition gives the longer of the two time constants as @xmath61 , where @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient in m@xmath47s@xmath48 and @xmath62 is in s. as noted above , the long time constant is insensitive to the initial condition , so the error arising from the uncertainty in the initial distribution is small . using the definition of @xmath18 given in eq.([eqn : diffusioncoeff ] ) and the calculation of the li - he diffusion cross - sections ,",
    "we obtain a theoretical prediction for the gradient @xmath79 .",
    "the theoretical results obtained at 293 , 80 and 20k are given in table [ tab : cross - sections ] where they are compared with the experimental gradients obtained from the fits shown in fig.[fig : experimentaldiffusiontimes ] .",
    "the error bars given here are the fitting errors , and do not include a possible systematic error in the determination of the helium density .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement at 80k and 20k , but disagree by a factor of approximately 2 at 293k .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "the temperature only enters the model through the diffusion coefficient , so if the discrepancy is due to an error in the model it must be that the calculated diffusion cross - section is accurate at 80k and 20k , but not at 293k .",
    "this seems unlikely .",
    "the alternative is that there is a systematic error in the experiment which is large at 293k , but small at the lower temperatures .",
    "the most obvious source of systematic error is in the determination of the helium density , but here we would expect the error to be smallest at 293k since the measurements were carefully calibrated at this temperature . we note that it is quite common to determine diffusion cross - sections from diffusion times in a buffer gas cell . to do so without using a reference atom requires a careful calibration of the buffer gas density and , unless the shape of the cell is particularly simple , a numerical model of diffusion in the actual cell geometry being used .",
    "next , we turn to the question of why the diffusion times flatten off at higher helium density . a similar behaviour , suggestive of an additional loss mechanism , has been noted in several other papers e.g. @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite the decay times were measured as a function of helium density for lithium , rubidium , silver and gold . in all cases , the decay times first increased linearly with helium density , but then turned over and gradually decreased with increasing density .",
    "the authors suggest three possible loss channels that might be responsible for the shortening of the lifetime at high density : the formation of dimers , capture of atoms by clusters formed during the ablation process , or atom loss on impurities present in the buffer gas or ablated off the target .",
    "one of these mechanisms might be responsible for the behaviour we observe . here , we suggest a fourth mechanism , based only on diffusion and on the way the initial molecule distribution depends on helium density .",
    "the absorption images , fig.[fig : images ] , show that there is a rapid initial ballistic expansion of molecules into the cell which sets the initial condition for the subsequent diffusion to the walls .",
    "when the density is low , the molecules rapidly fill the entire cell and so the initial distribution is set by the cell geometry and is independent of density . in this regime",
    "the diffusion time constant is proportional to the helium density . at higher densities",
    "however , an initial cloud of molecules is produced whose size depends on the helium density rather than on the cell size .",
    "the higher the density , the smaller the size of the initial cloud .",
    "this localization of the cloud results in a more rapid initial decay , as indicated in fig.[fig : modeldiffusiontimes ] , particularly if the probe is moved to a place where the signal is initially high , which it is natural to do experimentally .",
    "we see that at high density there are two competing density - dependent effects : increasing the density decreases the diffusion coefficient which slows down the diffusion , but increasing the density also reduces the initial size of the distribution which in turn drives faster diffusion , at least at the beginning .",
    "the turn - over from the proportional to the weakly - dependent regime occurs once the initial ballistic expansion fails to fill the cell , and this will depend on the cell s size and on the energy of the ablation pulse .",
    "ideally , it would be possible to observe the multi - exponential decay that will occur at high density , and to find the longest decay time which will be independent of the initial condition . in practice",
    "the amplitude of the lowest order mode may be too small to observe , in which case the initial condition will inevitably affect the measurement of the time constant in the way we have described .",
    "the translational and rotational temperatures can be determined by recording doppler - broadened spectra of the ybf molecules .",
    "the translational temperature is found from the gaussian widths of the lines , and the rotational temperature is determined from the relative strengths of transitions originating from different rotational states . since we record the time - evolution of the absorption at each laser frequency , we can determine the translational and rotational temperatures as a function of time .",
    "the measurement of the width and the area of the doppler - broadened lines is complicated by hyperfine splittings that are comparable to the doppler widths of the features themselves , and by the existence of several ybf isotopic species .",
    "the use of doppler - free saturated absorption spectroscopy enables us to identify the centre frequencies of the underlying components , and hence to fit a combination of multiple voigt profiles to the doppler - broadened spectra @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dopplerfits ] shows typical doppler - broadened spectra in an experiment where the cell temperature was approximately 20k and the helium density was approximately @xmath80m@xmath1 .",
    "two spectra are shown , one averaged over a 200@xmath9s wide time - window centred 200@xmath9s after the ablation pulse , and the other averaged over a window of the same width but centred 2000@xmath9s after the the ablation pulse . in the early time window",
    "the presence of multiple hyperfine components is hidden by the large doppler width , but this is revealed in the later time window when the translational temperature is lower . underneath the doppler - broadened profiles is shown the saturated absorption spectrum that was recorded simultaneously .",
    "there are four hyperfine components , though two of them remain unresolved in the doppler - free spectrum so we only see three resolved spectral lines .",
    "knowing the spacing of the hyperfine components from the doppler - free spectrum , we fit to the doppler - broadened spectra using a sum of voigt profiles , where the only free parameters are a single gaussian width and the amplitudes of the various components .",
    "the width of the lorentzian in the voigt profile is fixed at 30mhz which is the typical width obtained from fitting lorentzians to a large number of lines in the doppler - free spectrum .",
    "the fitted widths give translational temperatures of 76@xmath814k and 23@xmath811k for the two sets of data shown , clearly indicating the translational cooling of the ybf towards the temperature of the cell walls .",

    "this halves the hyperfine - averaged value of @xmath40 for this line . for the @xmath157 line ,",
    "the situation is different because the hyperfine components are unresolved in the doppler - free spectrum . in this case",
    "it is better to treat the two hyperfine levels as a single level and the value of @xmath40 is unchanged .",
    "these considerations lead us to an averaged branching ratio of @xmath158 .",
    "we do not know of any direct measurements or calculations of the franck - condon factor for the a@xmath159-x@xmath160 transition of ybf .",
    "however , we know that when the molecule is excited strongly on the @xmath161 component of the q@xmath162 line , the mean number of photons scattered is @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "this information , together with the table of branching ratios given in @xcite provides an estimated value of @xmath164 .",
    "a high value for @xmath139 is to be expected since ybf closely resembles the alkaline - earth monofluorides which all have this property @xcite . finally then",
    ", we take @xmath165 for this experiment .    putting these values into eq.([eq : sigmahf ] ) we obtain @xmath166m@xmath47 .",
    "there are a number of uncertainties in determining this value .",
    "the fractional error on the gradient of the straight line fit is 15% . using the spread in the diffusion lifetimes measured at the same nominal helium density we estimate the fractional uncertainty in our measurement of the helium density to be 20% .",
    "the fractional uncertainty in calibrating the laser intensity is also 20% . the fractional uncertainty in the branching ratio @xmath40 is estimated to be 24% , partly from the 5% uncertainty in the franck - condon factor , but mostly from the uncertainty of how best to treat the four unresolved components of the line as discussed above .",
    "this leads to a 19% error in the cross - section which depends on the value of @xmath167 .",
    "other possible errors come from the approximations we have made in our model .",
    "first , we have assumed that the absorption is small ; this does not contribute a significant error at this level .",
    "second , our analysis relies on the approximation that the collision rates are much smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "we have previously estimated @xmath118 to be approximately @xmath168rads@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "when we use our cross - section to calculate the collision rate , we obtain @xmath169s@xmath48 at @xmath170m@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the collision rate is approaching @xmath118 at the upper end of the plot .",
    "however , it is the points at low helium densities that primarily fix the gradient of the fit , since these have far more weight in the fit , and for these values the collision rates are much smaller than @xmath118 , consistent with our original assumption .",
    "third , we have used a fitting function that is appropriate when the laser is resonant for molecules at rest , but this can not be satisfied for all four of the unresolved components . we find that setting @xmath171 decreases the cross - section by 3% , and setting @xmath172 decreases the cross - section by 12% . considering the mean displacement of the components from the line centre at 80k , we conclude that the resulting change in the cross - section , and the associated error , are both negligible for this measurement .",
    "the final result is @xmath173m@xmath47 .",
    "this result is close to our calculated ybf - he diffusion cross - section at 80k , given in table [ tab : cross - sections ] , as one would expect if velocity - changing collisions dominate over inelastic collisions in determining the saturation intensity .",
    "the values of @xmath126 obtained from the fits to the data shown in fig.[fig : saturation](a ) , along with similar datasets taken at other helium densities , are independent of helium density and are consistent with one another across the whole range of helium densities .",
    "the mean value is @xmath174 .",
    "the fact that @xmath175 for the four unresolved components has a much larger effect on @xmath126 than on @xmath120 , and by considering the effect of this we obtain a corrected value of @xmath176 . using the above values of @xmath40 and @xmath137 ,",
    "the value for the optical absorption cross - section given by eq.([eq : crosssectionsimple ] ) is @xmath177m@xmath47 .",
    "taking an absorption length of @xmath178 cm and the fraction of all molecules in @xmath179 to be @xmath180 at 80k , we find the total density of ybf molecules to be @xmath181m@xmath1 in these experiments .",
    "the total number of ybf molecules produced is approximately @xmath182 .",
    "of course , the ybf density depends on the energy and spot size of the ablation laser , the target quality and the buffer gas density .",
    "nevertheless , we consistently produce this density of molecules once the experimental conditions are optimized .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of ybf molecules produced inside a helium buffer gas cell using a combination of absorption imaging , absorption spectroscopy and saturated absorption spectroscopy .",
    "while we have focussed on this particular molecule , we expect our results to carry over to a wide range of other polar radicals produced using similar methods .",
    "the absorption images show that , upon ablation of the target , the molecules that are formed expand ballistically into the cell on a @xmath9s timescale .",
    "when the helium density is low , this initial ballistic expansion completely fills the cell , but at higher helium density the expansion is arrested with the molecules confined to a region around the target .",
    "the molecules then diffuse slowly to the walls of the cell .",
    "we have measured how the diffusion time depends on the helium density and find the expected linear dependence at low density . at higher densities",
    "the diffusion times no longer increase with density but instead reach a roughly constant value .",
    "our modelling of the experiment shows that the diffusion is more rapid when the molecules are localized near the target than when they fill the cell , and that in the former case the decay curves depend strongly on the probe position , with the density decaying much faster when the probe is close to the target .",
    "this observation , along with the insights obtained from the absorption imaging , suggest that the levelling off of the lifetimes is due , at least in part , to the initial confinement of the molecules to a region close to the target . by comparing the diffusion of ybf and li at low helium densities , and using values for the li diffusion cross - section calculated from a well - established interaction potential ,",
    "we have measured the ybf - he diffusion cross - section at two temperatures .",
    "the experimental values agree with the theoretical values we calculate from the ybf - he potential given in @xcite .",
    "this is a first experimental test of that potential .",
    "we have compared our experimental results for the li diffusion times with the results of a numerical model of diffusion in this cell .",
    "the results agree at 80k and 20k , but differ by a factor of two at 293k where the results are most precise .",
    "this discrepancy is not understood but suggests that diffusion cross - sections determined by measuring lifetimes in a cell may not be accurate unless a reference atom is used .",
    "we have measured how the translational and rotational temperatures of the molecules change as a function of the time since their formation , for typical helium densities of about @xmath63m@xmath1 , and have compared our experimental results with those of various thermalization models .",
    "our conclusion is that the ybf molecules thermalize with the helium more rapidly than the @xmath183@xmath9s time resolution of the experiment . instead of observing that thermalization process",
    ", we see the cooling of the helium buffer gas which heats up when the target is ablated and then slowly cools back down to the temperature of the cell walls .",
    "we see that the cooling occurs on two separate timescales which differ by a factor of 10 , and we suppose that the heat of ablation is deposited in a local region close to the target , and that this heat first dissipates quickly into the rest of the gas , and then more slowly as it diffuses to the walls .    finally , we have made a detailed study of the absorption of a probe laser by molecules in a buffer gas cell , elucidating the main dynamical processes that are important . as the power of the probe laser is increased the absorbed power increases at first , but eventually saturates because the population in the resonant state is optically pumped into a multitude of other states that are not resonant with the laser . the resulting hole in the combined velocity and internal state distribution is repopulated by collisions , and so saturation of the absorption sets in when the rate of optical pumping is equal to the relevant collision rates .",
    "we have measured the fractional absorption as a function of laser intensity over a range of helium densities and find that the data fits well to our model .",
    "the intensity needed to saturate the absorption is directly proportional to the helium density for densities up to @xmath63m@xmath1 .",
    "the cross - section for the `` hole - filling '' collisions is consistent with our theoretical value for the ybf - he diffusion cross - section , as we would expect if velocity - change is the dominant hole filling mechanism .",
    "the same data are used to estimate the total ybf density , which is approximately @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "the total number of ybf molecules produced is approximately @xmath182 .    using an improved setup ,",
    "we have now reduced the cell temperature to 3.5k .",
    "at this temperature there will be about @xmath184 molecules in the rotational ground state . using a hydrodynamic flow of helium to sweep the molecules out of the cell",
    ", we expect that at least 10% can be extracted into a beam with a divergence of about 0.1steradian @xcite , resulting in a cold , slow - moving molecular beam with a flux of @xmath184 ground state ybf molecules per steradian per pulse .",
    "this is 2000 times more intense than the flux produced in a supersonic source of the same molecules @xcite , and provides molecules at considerably lower speed , and so promises a large improvement in the sensitivity of molecular beam experiments such as the measurement of the electron s electric dipole moment .",

    "to understand the interaction of the probe laser with the molecules in the buffer gas , we use a 3 level model of the molecule . in this model , a plane polarized laser field , @xmath185 , is detuned from resonance with the transition from level 1 to level 2 by an angular frequency @xmath186 .",
    "level 3 represents all other relevant molecular levels and is not coupled to the laser field .",
    "level 2 can decay by spontaneous emission , either to level 1 at rate @xmath187 , or to level 3 at rate @xmath188 .",
    "inelastic collisions with helium atoms also cause level 2 molecules to decay to levels 1 and 3 , with rates @xmath189 and @xmath190 respectively .",
    "elastic collisions dephase level 2 at a rate @xmath191 .",
    "levels 1 and 3 are assumed to be in the ground electronic state of the molecule , so spontaneous emission out of these levels is negligible .",

    "there is not enough energy for a collision to excite molecules to level 2 .",
    "molecules move in and out of the interaction region with a characteristic rate @xmath193 , which is the inverse of the average time taken to diffuse out of the probe laser beam . following the usual treatment that leads to the optical bloch equations for a two level atom , modified to account for the third level , for the collisions , and for the flux",
    ", we obtain the following equations for the rate of change of the level 1 and 2 populations , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , and of the coherence between these two levels @xmath196 :      here , @xmath198 is the fraction of all molecules in level 1 when the probe laser is off , and @xmath199 is the rabi frequency defined by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the @xmath202 component of @xmath203 and @xmath204 is the dipole moment operator . as the laser propagates a small distance @xmath205 through the molecular sample of number density @xmath15 , its intensity , @xmath206 , changes due to absorption and stimulated emission by the amount      it will be useful to define the dimensionless rates @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , along with a dimensionless quantity proportional to the laser intensity , @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is called the saturation intensity .",
    "it will also be helpful to make use of the relationship between @xmath192 and @xmath129 which is easily found by ensuring that the populations are in a steady state when the laser is turned off : @xmath215    we will calculate the absorption averaged over a time window that is very short compared to the characteristic diffusion time , but very long compared to @xmath216 . in this case",
    ", we can take @xmath15 to be a constant , and we can use the steady state solution to the above dynamical equations .",
    "after some algebra we find the steady state values for the density of molecules in levels 1 and 2 to be @xmath217 where @xmath91 is the laser excitation rate , @xmath218    with the populations in steady - state , the equation for the intensity reduces to @xmath219 it is convenient to rewrite this equation in terms of the reduced intensity @xmath220 , which we can do using the relationships between @xmath116 , @xmath221 , and @xmath199 given above . we also introduce a reduced length @xmath222 , @xmath57 being the total length of the interaction region .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the absorption cross - section of the molecule .",
    "to reach eq.([eq : crosssection ] ) we have used the expression for the decay rate , @xmath225 , have made the approximation that the frequencies of all allowed transitions are equal , @xmath226 , and have generalized the notation in order to handle the prickly issue of degeneracy . to represent the molecule accurately , we have to allow each of levels 1 and 2 to represent a set of degenerate or near - degenerate levels . in eq.([eq : crosssection ] ) , @xmath227 represents a particular zeeman sub - level of level 1 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 is the sub - level @xmath230 of level 2 , and @xmath31 is an index which runs over all the sub - levels of levels 1 and 3 . the branching ratio @xmath40 is the rate for spontaneous decay to _ any _ of the sub - levels in 1 , divided by the total spontaneous decay rate . using this , we see that eq.([eq : crosssection ] ) can be written in the form @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a factor that accounts for the degeneracy , the sum running over all sublevels @xmath233 of level 1 .",
    "finally , when level 1 is degenerate and the molecular sample is unpolarized , we have to remember to take the average value of @xmath95 calculated for each of the ground state sub - levels @xmath234 . using these same definitions ,",

    "this modifies the treatment in two ways .",
    "first , we have to write the equations for the absorption as a function of @xmath253 and then integrate over @xmath253 at the end to obtain the total absorption .",
    "let us use a new symbol , @xmath254 , for the detuning of the laser from the at - rest transition frequency , and use @xmath255 for the doppler shift of a molecule , @xmath256 .",

    "the probe laser tends to modify the velocity distribution by depleting the resonant velocity group , whereas collisions tend to restore the velocity distribution towards thermal equilibrium .",

    "we make the `` strong collisions '' approximation , meaning that @xmath269 is independent of @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "then , to make sure that the system is in equilibrium when the probe laser is turned off , we must have @xmath270 from which it follows that @xmath271 , where @xmath130 is the total collision rate integrated over all final velocities , @xmath272 .",
    "it follows that the extra terms that appear in the rate equation for @xmath265 reduce to @xmath266_c =- n_1(v)\\gamma _ c+f_1 g(v)\\gamma _",
    "c n.\\ ] ]    if we look back at eq.([eq : rho11 ] ) , re - write it as a function of @xmath253 and multiply through by @xmath15 so that it becomes a rate equation for @xmath273 , we find that the last two terms in the equation are @xmath274 , which has exactly the same form as the above equation .",
    "a similar replacement occurs in the equation for @xmath195 .",
    "so we see that to include velocity - changing collisions we simply have to replace @xmath193 with @xmath275 .",
    "these are very general results that can be used to calculate the degree of absorption for almost any case , once the relevant rates are known .",
    "the same equations give the spectral lineshapes to be expected as the laser frequency is scanned , and tell us how the fractional absorption changes with the intensity of the probe laser . in general , we will have to solve eq.([eq : dsdzintegrated ] ) numerically . furthermore ,",
    "if the intensity of the probe laser is not uniform over the interaction volume , we should divide up the volume into small elements and integrate over these too .",
    "however , in many cases of interest the results simplify considerably because some particular quantity is small .",
    "next , we examine some of these simpler cases .      when @xmath279 we can neglect it in the denominator of eq.([eq : dsdzintegrated ] ) , so that we have @xmath280 where @xmath281 the fractional absorption is @xmath282 the full expression for @xmath283 is quite complicated , but when the laser is on resonance with the atomic transition ( i.e. @xmath284 ) it simplifies to a reasonably compact form : @xmath285.\\ ] ] when @xmath286 , which will usually be the case if the gas is warm and the collision rates are not too much larger than @xmath118 , this expression simplifies further to @xmath287 .",

    "let us specialize to the case of just two levels by setting all the rates involving level 3 to zero and by setting @xmath293 . neglecting all the remaining collision rates and the flux term @xmath193",
    ", we obtain @xmath294 when the intensity is low and the velocity distribution is neglected , we have , using eq.([eq : lowintensitya ] ) @xmath295 when the absorption is small and the velocity distribution is neglected , but the input intensity is not necessarily small , we have @xmath296 where @xmath214 is the saturation intensity defined by eq.([eq : is ] ) . in eqs.([eq : exponentialabsorption ] ) and ( [ eq : lowabsorptiongeneral ] ) we have kept @xmath198 in the numerator even though it is unity in this case because , as we shall soon see , the same equations hold for other cases .",
    "we note that in this two level limit , the absorption cross - section may reach its maximum possible value , @xmath297 .",
    "for example , in an atomic transition with zero angular momentum in the ground state and one unit in the excited state ( an s - p transition ) we have @xmath298 and so @xmath299 .",
    "by contrast a p - s transition has @xmath138 for the @xmath300 component and @xmath301 for the other two components meaning that for an unpolarized sample the level - averaged absorption cross - section is @xmath302 .",
    "returning to the 3 level system , let us assume that all the collision rates are much smaller than @xmath304 , and let us also take the flux @xmath193 to be much smaller than the collision rates .",
    "this limit applies to most of the experiments reported in this paper .    in almost all situations we expect @xmath305 because the effective degeneracy of state 3 is vastly larger than that of level 1 .",
    "then we have @xmath306 .",
    "the only exception is when level 1 is the ground rotational state and the rotational temperature is much lower than the rotational spacing . using this approximation , along with the ones discussed above , @xmath72 and @xmath241 simplify to @xmath307 when the laser intensity is low and we neglect the distribution of velocities the fractional absorption is again given by eq.([eq : exponentialabsorption ] ) , just as in the two - level case .",
    "similarly , when the absorption is small and we neglect the velocity distribution , we again have eq.([eq : lowabsorptiongeneral ] ) except that @xmath214 in this equation is replaced by a new saturation intensity @xmath308 when the absorption is small and we include the velocity distribution , the result is the same as in eq.([eq : lowabsorptionintegrated ] ) , but with @xmath214 again replaced by the @xmath120 of eq.([eq : is2 ] ) .",
    "we see that for the three level system in this limit , the intensity required to saturate the absorption is proportional to the sum of two rates , the collision rate that transfers population between levels 1 and 3 , and the rate for velocity changing collisions",
