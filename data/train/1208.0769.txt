    "the recent discovery @xcite of a resonance with a mass of about 125 gev @xcite in @xmath5 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) could well correspond to the long - awaited observation of the higgs boson @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "if so , it would herald another remarkable success of the sm , which predicted the existence of a higgs boson with a mass less than 152 gev at 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "@xcite based on precision measurements of electroweak parameters such as the masses of the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite bosons , and of the top quark @xcite .",
    "while the observed properties of the new resonance are consistent with those of the sm higgs boson , further measurements are required to determine if it has one of the key properties predicted by the sm : couplings to fermions that are proportional to their masses .",
    "fortunately , a higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev provides a wealth of decay modes in which to study its couplings .",
    "in addition to the subleading decays that dominate the sensitivity of the initial observation ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) , the leading decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be observed in various production processes @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a wide variety of higgs boson cross section measurements will provide incisive tests of specific sm couplings @xcite .",
    "the prospects for higgs boson discovery and measurement have been studied extensively @xcite ; however , low - rate processes observable with the full lhc design luminosity have not been completely explored .",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of 100 fb@xmath3 of @xmath4 tev lhc data to the higgs boson production processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , followed by @xmath13 and at least one @xmath14 or @xmath15 decay @xcite .",
    "the potential measurement sensitivity to the @xmath0 process has been considered only perfunctorily @xcite , though the cms experiment has recently performed the first @xmath0 search in the @xmath13 decay channel at the lhc @xcite .",
    "studies of @xmath2 production have been performed in various top - quark and tau - lepton decay channels @xcite ; we revisit @xmath16 production in light of the demonstrated performance of the atlas and cms experiments in separating hadronic tau decays from the large hadronic jet background in data @xcite .",
    "combining the prospects for measurements of associated higgs boson production in the @xmath17 decay channel with those in the @xmath18 decay channel  @xcite improves the expected lhc sensitivity to the yukawa coupling ratio @xmath19 .",
    "this ratio is determined at tree level by the bottom - quark and tau - lepton masses and is thus sensitive to differences in the source of mass for quarks and leptons @xcite",
    ". the ratios of associated higgs production measurements also directly provide the coupling ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section  [ sec : strategy ] outlines the procedures for generating , simulating and selecting higgs boson and background events ; section  [ sec : analysis ] describes the specific selection and expected signal and background yields for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 processes ; section  [ sec : results ] presents the results of the fit to cross section in each channel and the uncertainties on partial - width ratios ; and section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we simulate all signal and background processes using the sherpa @xcite event generator , except for @xmath22 , which is simulated using alpgen @xcite for the hard process and pythia @xcite for the hadronization and showering .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 cross sections are obtained from alpgen ; all other processes are normalized to cross sections calculated at next - to - leading order in @xmath24 .",
    "detector resolutions and efficiencies are modelled using the delphes simulation @xcite with corrections based predominantly on atlas @xcite performance projections ; similar performance is expected with the cms @xcite detector .",
    "events are selected using the reconstructed delphes objects .",
    "we use cteq6 m parton distribution functions @xcite for cross section calculations .",
    "samples are generated with quark and gluon jets included to leading order at the matrix - element level , and additional jets modelled by parton showering .",
    "tau leptons are decayed within sherpa .",
    "the cross sections and branching ratios for the higgs boson production and decay processes are shown in table  [ tbl : s_xsec ] .",
    "we study higgs boson masses ( @xmath25 ) in the 115 - 135 gev range to investigate the dependence of the expected sensitivity on @xmath25 .",
    "cross sections for @xmath26 production are calculated with v2hv @xcite and include qcd corrections at nlo .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd @xcite and nlo electroweak @xcite corrections are @xmath27 relative to the v2hv calculation .",
    "cross sections for @xmath2 production include qcd corrections at nlo @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on all signal cross sections are @xmath28(10% ) , while those on the branching ratios determined from hdecay @xcite are @xmath28(1% ) .

    "with the recent discovery of a resonance with cross sections consistent with that of the sm higgs boson , tests of the specific sm predictions of the higgs boson couplings are a high priority",
    ". a higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev can be measured in a wealth of production and decay channels .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of channels that have not been investigated in this context , or that have not been considered promising because of the expected large jet - to-@xmath30 background . assuming the experiments can achieve similar tau reconstruction performance in @xmath4 tev data as they have in @xmath31 tev data , each experiment can measure the cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath2 production in the @xmath13 decay channels to @xmath32 precision with 100 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity . additionally , with achievable @xmath33 reconstruction , a measurement of @xmath1 production with an accuracy of @xmath34 is possible with the same luminosity . with more data the sensitivity to @xmath1 and @xmath2 production should improve , while sensitivity to @xmath0 production is unlikely to improve significantly due to systematic uncertainties on the background .",
    "if the assumed @xmath30 identification efficiency or @xmath33 resolution can not be achieved , targeted background rejection through e.g. a multivariate analysis or improved mass reconstruction could compensate . including additional decays of the tau leptons or top quarks",
    "would also improve sensitivity . by combining the associated production measurements in @xmath13",
    "decays with measurements of the same production mechanisms in @xmath12 decays  @xcite , a precision of @xmath32 on the ratio of partial widths @xmath35 is achievable .",
    "we expect associated higgs production with @xmath13 to provide an important contribution to higgs coupling measurements with 100 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity at @xmath4 tev .",
