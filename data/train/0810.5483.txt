    "in order to set up realistic models for dark matter haloes , we need to leave the well - trodden path of spherical symmetry and consider structures that reflect this variety in shapes .",
    "a crucial step is the construction of exact flattened or triaxial potential - density pairs with a realistic density structure ( for example a cuspy behaviour at small radii ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to construct such axisymmetric or triaxial potential - density pairs is to consider a spherical density profile @xmath6 with the desired characteristics . if one replaces in this expression the spherical radius @xmath0 by an oblate spheroidal radius @xmath7 or a triaxial radius @xmath8 one obtains an axisymmetric or triaxial density profile @xmath9 whose isodensity surfaces are concentric oblate spheroids or ellipsoids with fixed axis ratios .",
    "this is a very straightforward recipe to construct simple oblate , prolate or triaxial density profiles , but unfortunately the formulae to calculate the corresponding potential @xmath10 are cumbersome and can only be calculated numerically . in n - body or hydrodynamical simulations , the potential ( or its gradient ) has to be calculated very frequently and should be known with as efficiently and accurately as possible to avoid numerical artifacts . as a result , it is worthwhile to look for methods to create exact potential - density pairs for axisymmetric or triaxial configurations in which the potential can be calculated in a more straightforward way .",
    "one general approach one can apply is to modify a spherical potential - density pair by adding a ( finite ) spherical harmonics expansion to it . while this approach can in principle be used to construct exact potential - density pairs for axisymmetric or triaxial systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the number of terms in the expansion typically has to be substantial , such that we approach a similar situation as before . an alternative approach to construct axisymmetric or triaxial potential - density pairs is to apply a transformation @xmath11 on the potential rather than on the density .",
    "if we have an analytical expression for @xmath12 , we can use poisson s equation to calculate the corresponding density distribution @xmath13 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the calculation of the density @xmath13 from the potential @xmath14 requires only differentiations , such that one always obtains potential - density pairs in which both potential and density are analytical functions .",
    "one disadvantage is that one can not a priori set the shape of the isodensity contours ; it is not even guaranteed that the density corresponding to a given potential is everywhere positive .",
    "a second disadvantage is that simple recipes such as equation  ( [ moblate ] ) do not work for the potential , because the isopotential surfaces need to become spherical at large radii .",
    "other , unavoidably more complicated , recipes must be considered .    a successful example to construct an oblate analytical potential - density pair based on this strategy was the seminal work by @xcite .",
    "these authors create an exact potential - density pair by considering the spherical plummer potential @xmath15 and turning it into a flattened potential @xmath16 the resulting density distribution can be calculated fairly easily .",
    "this technique of constructing flattened or triaxial potential - density pairs has been applied to other potentials by e.g.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite . while this recipe provides a straightforward means to create analytical flattened potential - density pairs , it generates densities that do not correspond to astrophysical systems such as dark matter haloes .",
    "indeed , at large radii the miyamoto - nagai type models show a notorious double behaviour , with a thin disc superposed on a roughly spherical density profile . while this could provide a first approximation for disc galaxies ( although the density in galaxy discs is exponential rather than @xmath3 ) , this is obviously not the desired shape for a dark matter halo .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to construct axisymmetric or triaxial potential - density pairs that can be used to model realistic dark matter haloes , starting from an arbitrary spherical potential - density pair . in section",
    "2 we formulate a recipe based on the @xcite approach and we demonstrate that such models always have the conspicuous @xmath3 disc - like behaviour at large radii , such that it can not be used to represent dynamical systems as dark matter haloes . in section  3",
    "we adapt our recipe to cure this conspicuous behaviour and we demonstrate that this new recipe can produce analytical axisymmetric potential - density pairs which retain the original behaviour of the original density profile at both small and large radii . in section",
    "4 we apply this recipe to create a set of flattened potential - density suitable to represent dark matter haloes based on the spherical @xcite models . section  5 sums up .",
    "in order to create a set of oblate spheroidal models , we will replace the spherical radius @xmath0 in the spherical model by a spheroidal radius @xmath17 . we need to find a prescript such that @xmath1 is flattened at small radii and spherical at large radii . a general form that satisfies these requirements",
    "is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a monotonically rising function of @xmath20 which has the asymptotic behaviour that it approaches 1 at large radii and a constant value @xmath21 at small radii .",
    "there are of course infinitely many different functions @xmath19 with these characteristics .",
    "inspired by @xcite we concentrate on one such particular function @xmath22 for which we find @xmath23 substituting expression  ( [ q ] ) into ( [ mgeneral ] ) we obtain @xmath24 when we move to polar coordinates in the equatorial plane using @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we find that at small radii @xmath27 whereas at large radii @xmath28 . the equipotential surfaces of the potential @xmath29 will hence be flattened with flattening @xmath21 at small radii and spherical at large radii , as required .",

    "if the density of the initial spherical model decreases more slowly than @xmath48 , the density of the corresponding oblate model will asymptotically reduce to the density of the spherical model .",
    "there is one caveat , however : the asymptotic expansion for the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 derived above is not valid within the equatorial plane @xmath49 . since @xmath50 in the entire equatorial plane",
    ", we have by construction @xmath51 and @xmath52 at every position @xmath53 in the equatorial plane , such that we have the identities @xmath54 in the equatorial plane , the contribution of the second term in ( [ rhof ] ) will not decrease as @xmath55 , but only as @xmath3 , and it will therefore dominate the contribution of the first term . the mean density term @xmath36 is only dominant at large radii in the equatorial plane , such that the final density @xmath31 will have a discy structure at large radii , with a thin @xmath3 disc superposed on a nearly spherical density profile .",
    "this behaviour is present in all miyamoto - nagai type models @xcite and unfortunately turns this recipe unsuitable for the construction of realistic flattened dark matter halo models .",
    "an inconvenience about the family of models presented in the previous section was the appearance of a discy structure at large radii . at large radii ,",
    "the density profiles of the models behave similarly as their spherical progenitors , at all polar angles except in the equatorial plane @xmath50 .",
    "mathematically , the reason for this discy structure is the discontinuous asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath19 . outside the equatorial plane , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at large radii , such that the coefficient @xmath39 disappears . in the equatorial plane , however , @xmath20 is always equal to zero and @xmath39 does not converge to zero , such that the mean density term @xmath36 contributes to ( and dominates ) the density .",
    "if we want to construct a set of models which do not show this discy structure at large radii , we can try to adapt the recipe from the previous section in a way that @xmath58 smoothly goes to one at large radii , both inside and outside the equatorial plane .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing the oblate radius @xmath1 from equation  ( [ mgeneral ] ) by @xmath59 using the functional form ( [ q ] ) for @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61}.    \\label{m2}\\ ] ] or @xmath62}.    \\label{m2}\\ ] ] this new oblate radius @xmath1 has a similar asymptotic behaviour at small and large radii as the original version ( [ m ] ) . replacing @xmath0 by this oblate radius @xmath1 in the expression @xmath2 for the potential of a spherical model",
    ", we obtain an oblate axisymmetric potential @xmath30 . the density that self - consistently generates this potential can be found through poisson s equation .",
    "going through a similar analysis as in the previous section , we find that the density can be written as @xmath63 where the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are now given by @xmath66 ,    \\label{u1}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 ,    \\label{u2}\\ ] ] with now obviously @xmath68 again , it is elementary to check that for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the trivial case @xmath43 .",
    "after some algebra , one obtains that the asymptotic expansion of the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 at large radii becomes @xmath71 these expansions are valid for all directions ; in particular , there is no different behaviour of these components in the equatorial plane . comparing the asymptotic behaviour of these coefficients to those of the previous section",
    ", we see that the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath64 both have an asymptotic behaviour with simply 1 as the leading term , such that the first term in the total density  ( [ rhof ] ) or  ( [ rhof2 ] ) behaves identically as the density of the original spherical model . the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath65 behave in a different way , however : while @xmath39 decreases as @xmath72 at large radii , @xmath65 decreases only as @xmath73 , with an additional @xmath74 azimuthal dependence . only for",
    "those models where the density of the initial spherical model decreases more slowly than @xmath4 , the density of the corresponding flattened model will asymptotically reduce to the density of the spherical model . for models where the density decreases more rapidly at large radii",
    ", the density will be dominated by the second term .",
    "as this term becomes negative at large radii near the rotation axis , such models are unacceptable .",
    "this method to flatten spherical potential - density pairs is therefore limited to those models where the density decreases more slowly than @xmath4 .",
    "this is typically the case for dark matter haloes .",
    "the goal of this paper was to consider a method to , starting from a spherical potential - density pair , construct a flattened analog that preserves the asymptotic behaviour of the density profile at both small and large radii .",
    "an asymptotic analysis of the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 learns that both terms converge to a finite value at small radii , @xmath75 assume that our density profile @xmath6 behaves as a power law at small radii , @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to check that the mean density @xmath78 has a similar slope , @xmath79 combining the expressions  ( [ msmallr ] ) , ( [ rhof2 ] ) , ( [ u1smallr ] ) , ( [ u2smallr ] ) , ( [ rhosmallr ] ) and ( [ barrhosmallr ] ) , we find the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath31 at small radii , @xmath80 this result demonstrates that the asymptotic behaviour of the original spherical model is preserved after the flattening : the slope of the density profile remains , only the zero point changes and becomes dependent of the polar angle @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , along the major and minor axes we find the expansions @xmath82 using these expressions , we easily find the expression for the flattening @xmath83 of the isodensity surfaces at small radii , @xmath84 for modest flattening ( @xmath85 ) we find a nearly linear relation , @xmath86 apart from the well - known fact that the isodensity surfaces are generally more flattened than the isopotential surfaces , this equation illustrates that the flattening of the inner isodensity surfaces increases with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "as an application of the formalism we have described in the previous section , we construct in this section a set of flattened dark matter halo models . our starting point is the general three - parameter family of generalized nfw models or zhao models @xmath88^{-(\\gamma_\\infty-\\gamma_0)/\\eta}.    \\label{zhao}\\ ] ] the density of this general model is characterized by a power law with ( negative ) slopes @xmath87 and @xmath89 at respectively small and large radii .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath90 , is a measure of the width of the transition region between the two power - law zones .",
    "this three - parameter model , the general dynamical properties of which are described by @xcite and @xcite , includes a large variety of well - known simple potential density pairs used extensively throughout the literature to describe dynamical systems ranging from galactic nuclei to dark matter haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these authors used the jeans equations to derived the density profile of a self - gravitating spherically symmetric dynamical system that satisfy two characteristics of dark haloes observed in cosmological simulations .",
    "the first of these characteristics is the mysterious power - law behaviour of the so - called pseudo phase - space density with @xmath91 the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath92 a free parameter .",

    "@xmath94 with @xmath95 the velocity dispersion @xcite .",

    "constrained by these two assumptions , together with the assumption of spherical symmetry , @xcite derived a dark matter halo density of the form  ( [ zhao ] ) , with @xmath96 with @xmath97 the value of the velocity anisotropy parameter at small radii and @xmath98 the total mass .",

    "the isopotential surfaces ( top row ) are nearly spheroidal , and the flattening decreases smoothly from the centre ( where the axis ratio is equal to @xmath21 ) to spherical at large radii . the bottom row shows the isodensity surface plots of the corresponding models .",
    "the isodensity surfaces are nearly spheroidal in the central regions with a flattening that is much stronger than the flattening of the potential . for increasing radii ,",
    "the isodensity surfaces become increasingly lemon - shaped , and at large radii , they become very discy with an @xmath3 dependence in the equatorial plane , in agreement with the results from section  2 .",

    "compared to figure  2 , the shape of the isopotential surfaces is hardly different , with just a small alteration ( a smoother behaviour ) near the equatorial plane .",
    "this minor change does affect the large - scale behaviour of the isodensity surfaces significantly : the discy structure at large radii disappears and the isodensity surfaces remain roughly spheroidal with a flattening that smoothly disappears for increasing radii .    for models with a modest potential flattening ( @xmath104 ) ,",
