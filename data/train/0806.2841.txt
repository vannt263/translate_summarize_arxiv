    "we are interested in four - image lenses , where the source is within the astroid .",
    "we therefore make no further reference to the radial caustic . a typical astroid is shown in figure [ fig : u - theta - def ] for a lens galaxy modeled by a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) , which is commonly used in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is customary to define source - plane coordinates @xmath13 centered on the caustic and aligned with its symmetry axes .",
    "however , for fold and cusp configurations , where the source is a small distance from the caustic , it is more natural to work in coordinates @xmath14 centered on the fold or cusp point . for convenience ,",
    "we define the @xmath15 axis tangent to ( and the @xmath16 axis orthogonal to ) the caustic at that point .",
    "transforming from the @xmath13 plane to the @xmath14 plane requires a translation plus a rotation . to derive this coordinate transformation ,",

    "<S> some of these results were derived previously for a source asymptotically close to a cusp point , but using a simplified form of the lens equation whose validity may be in doubt for sources that lie at astrophysically relevant distances from the caustic . </S>",
