    "following the experiment by lohmann _",

    "a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath7 is applied to the graphene sheet . by using the tight - binding hamiltonian and the landauer - bttiker formulism in the framework of non - equilibrium green s function method , the longitudinal and",

    "the numerical results show that the longitudinal resistances @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the top and bottom edges , respectively , are usually different in the presence of the magnetic field , as expected from the property of the chirality of hall edge states .",
    "there is an essential difference in the transport behavior between unipolar and bipolar graphene junctions . for unipolar",
    "( n - n and p - p ) junctions , the longitudinal resistances have plateau structures in the case of clean ( no disorder ) graphene .",
    "the resistance plateaus can keep in the moderate disorder strength , and they are destroyed until the very strong disorder . on the other hand , for bipolar ( n - p and p - n ) graphene junctions , the longitudinal resistances @xmath8 and @xmath9 are very large in the clean case .",
    "but in the presence of disorder , they are strongly decreased even when the disorder strength is weak . for n - p junctions ,",
    "the top - edge resistance @xmath10 reduces to a moderate positive value , but the bottom - edge resistance @xmath11 drops to zero or even turns negative . in a suitable range of disorder strength , the resistances @xmath8 and @xmath9 of bipolar junctions also have plateau structures due to the full mixing of hall edge states . for the lowest filling factors ,",
    "the resistance plateaus exist in a very broad range of disorder strength .",
    "hence , they are produced easily in experiment .",
    "but for high filling factors , the plateau only emerges in a narrow disorder range , if it exists .",
    "furthermore , for moderate disorder , the plots of the longitudinal resistances versus the gate voltage exhibit plateau structures in both cases of unipolar and bipolar junctions and the plateau values are only determined by the filling factors @xmath12 , which are in excellent agreement with the recent experiment by lohmann _",

    "terminals 1 and 4 are the current source and drain , respectively , and other terminals are used as the voltage probes .",
    "the whole graphene device is basically divided into three regions : the left , central and right regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "each of the left and right regions includes three terminals .",
    "the dimension of the central region is described by the integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 [ see the red - site ( dark gray ) region in fig .",

    "the width of voltage terminals is chosen as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 nm is the distance between two neighboring carbons .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows the case @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the whole system is subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field which leads to the formation of landau levels . in quantum hall regime , bulk states",
    "are compressible , and the chiral edge states flow along the edges .",
    "this behavior is independent of the type of the edges if the graphene ribbon is wide enough .",
    "so we choose wide zigzag - graphene ribbon for our simulation .",
    "compared to the hopping term , both zeeman splitting and spin - orbit coupling are very small and hence they are negligible .",
    "furthermore , we adopt anderson on - site disorder .",
    "in fact , other types of disorders ( e.g. the interface disorder and the long - range disorder ) may exist in the experimental device and also lead to the edge state mixing .",
    "but from the point of the edge state mixing , these other types of disorders should have the similar effect . here",

    "the reason for using a width of the graphene ribbon far larger than the magnetic length is that edge states can not mix except near the boundary of the junction .",

    "the assumption of partial mixing of edge states in long enough junctions is reasonable , because part of the hall edge states are near the junction boundary but the other hall edge states are far away from the boundary .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath192 edge states taking part in the full mixing [ i.e. , the residual @xmath193 edge states in the left and right regions do not participate in any mixing ] , the plateau values can be analytically obtained by landauer - bttiker formalism : @xmath194 if @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( i.e. full mixing ) , the result of eq.([eq10 ] ) reduces to eq.([eq5 ] ) . by taking @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , the plateau values given by eq.([eq10 ] ) are @xmath189 and @xmath200 , which are well consistent with the numerical results in fig .",

    "finally , we simply discuss how the width @xmath22 of a graphene junction affects @xmath162 and @xmath9 . with increasing @xmath22 at fixed length @xmath23 ,",
    "the resistances @xmath8 and @xmath9 decrease , the resistance plateaus exist in broader disorder range regardless of the type of the junction ( unipolar or bipolar ) .",
    "also , for the large @xmath22 , some high - filling - factors resistance plateaus emerge .",
    "this is expected as hall edge states in a wider junction have more chance to mix with each other .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the longitudinal resistances at the two edges of a six - terminal graphene junction in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . by considering the presence of disorder in the vicinity of the junction interface ,",
    "the longitudinal resistances at opposite edges exhibit different plateaus structures .",
    "it is found that the plateau values are only determined by the landau filling factors .",
    "the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the recent experiment by lohmann _",
    "et al._. furthermore , for unipolar junctions , resistance plateaus exist in clean junctions .",
    "the plateau structure can be kept in the presence of weak and moderate disorder , and they are destroyed by very strong disorder . however , for bipolar junctions , the longitudinal resistances are very large and do not have any plateau structure in the clean case . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the resistances sharply drop even in the case of very weak disorder and they exhibit plateau structures for suitable disorder strength . in addition , we study the effect of the size of a graphene junction on the resistances and find that some extra resistance plateaus emerge in long graphene junctions .",
    "we explain this by proposing that only part of edge states participate in the mixing .",

    "if the disorder region is extended to the whole dashed - box region , including the red - site ( dark gray ) central region and two green - site ( light gray ) regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the numerical results are almost unchanged .",
    "this is because the hall edge states are robust against the disorder .",
    "@xmath201 corresponds @xmath202 t , which is quite a large magnetic field . due to the small size of the present system",
    ", we have to take a strong magnetic field to ensure the magnetic length far smaller than the width of graphene ribbon . for a large system",
    ", the magnetic field can be greatly decreased and the numerical results remain the same .      due to the lateral confinement of the system and the presence of the magnetic field , the carrier concentration @xmath134 is not strictly proportional to @xmath203 .",
    "but it still is a good approximation because the carrier concentrations @xmath134 only are the slight fluctuations around sgn@xmath204 .",
    "in addition , this approximation does not change the value of the resistance plateaus , except for slightly changing the width of the resistance plateaus ."
