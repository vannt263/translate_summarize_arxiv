    "one of the key open questions in the study of relativistic jets is how they interact with the immediate plasma environment .",
    "the above mentioned outflows are commonly thought to be dynamically hot ( relativistic ) magnetized plasma flows launched , accelerated , and collimated in regions where poynting flux dominates over particle ( matter ) flux ( e.g. , blandford & znajek 1977 ; mckinney et al .",
    "this scenario involves a helical large - scale magnetic field structure in some agn jets , which provides a unique signature in the form of observed asymmetries across the jet width , particularly in the polarization ( e.g. , laing 1981 ; aloy et al . 2000 ; clausen - brown , lyutikov , & karb 2011 ) .",

    "the shocks are collisionless and result from the growth of kinetic beam - plasma instabilities : either electrostatic ( e.g. , two - stream or buneman modes ) , quasi electrostatic ( e.g. , bret et al .",
    "2010 ) , or electromagnetic ( e.g. , filamentation ) .",
    "extensive pic simulations have been performed to investigate the microscopic processes of jet - driven collisionless relativistic shocks without implementing jet boundaries .",
    "the simulations have shown that in shocks in un- or weakly magnetized plasmas beam - plasma instabilities produce current filaments and associated magnetic fields that lead to particle acceleration and emission ( e.g. , weibel 1959 ; medvedev & loeb 1999 ; frederiksen et al .",

    "the slightly stronger current filaments around the jet boundary are likely generated by the mi .",
    "these small current filaments merge into the two larger current filaments at @xmath110 shown in figure [ fig12]d .",

    "our jet radius and transverse grid dimensions properly reveal the different evolution associated with the velocity shear instability .",

    ", interaction and magnetic fields do not extend far from the initial velocity shear surface .",
    "for the @xmath1 cases , interaction and magnetic fields extend farther from the initial velocity shear surface although the interaction occurs more inside the jet for higher jet lorentz factor .",
    "differences in velocity shear magnetic field structure resulting from differences in composition should have consequences for the appearance of jets in very high - resolution radio imaging .",
    "for a simple cylindrical geometry velocity shear case , an electron - proton jet would primarily build toroidal magnetic field at the velocity shear surface .",
    "the magnetic field would appear quasi - parallel to the line of sight at the limbs of the jet for typical aspect angles @xmath113 .",
    "in contrast , a pair - plasma jet would generate sizable radial field components that are only about a factor of two weaker than the toroidal field .",
    "the strong electric and magnetic fields in the velocity shear zone will be conducive to particle acceleration as shown in figure [ fig5]b .",
    "since the dc field is stronger than the ac field in the electron - proton case , a kinetic treatment is clearly required in order to fully capture the generated field structure ( alves et al .",
    "the generated field structure is important because it may lead to a distinct radiation signature ( e.g. , medvedev 2000 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2009b ; martins et al .",

    "since the jet length is only @xmath114 , the leading edge shock system is not yet fully formed , but the current filaments are merged as in the shock simulations .    the dissipation of a significant fraction of the magnetic energy , e.g. , via magnetic reconnection , will naturally result in the appearance of flares when the accelerated particle beam is directed along the line of sight ( giannios et al .",

    "recently , beniamini & granot ( 2015 ) have studied the expected prompt grb emission from magnetic reconnection and compare its expected temporal and spectral properties to observations .",
    "therefore , it is very important to investigate any signatures of reconnection .",
    "for example as shown in figure [ fig10]a in the jet around @xmath109 and in figure [ fig10]b around @xmath110 , complicated magnetic field structures may be a signature of reconnection .",
    "future work will address this possibility .",
    "current and magnetic structures are very different in the electron - proton and electron positron cases .",
    "the differences arise from the different mobilities of protons and positrons .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field found for the @xmath0 case would lead to a stratification in the emission across the jet width due to the dependence of the synchrotron emission with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight ( e.g. , aloy et al .",
    "2000 ; clause - brown et al .",
    "furthermore , a toroidal magnetic field would lead to a gradient in faraday rotation across the jet width , produced by the systematic change in the net line - of - sight magnetic field component ( laing 1981 ; blandford 1993 ) .",

    "( 2002 ) based on vlba observations of 3c273 . following this initial detection",

    "furthermore , a sign change from positive to negative faraday rotation was observed in 3c273 , that resembles the change in polarity of the toroidal field found in our electron - proton case .",
    "more recently , gmez et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have investigated the faraday rotation screen in bl lacertae through space - vlbi observations with the radioastron mission .",
    "these observations , achieving an angular resolution of @xmath11520 uas ( the highest obtained to date ) , reveal a gradient in faraday rotation and polarization vectors as a function of position angle with respect to the core , suggesting the presence of a large - scale helical magnetic field threading the jet in bl lacertae .",
    "additional work is required to explore the observational signatures of the different magnetic field properties expected for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "the resulting magnetic field structures are different enough to yield distinctive polarizations in vlbi observations of agn jets .",
    "toroidal magnetic fields inside and outside the electron - proton jet may contribute to circular polarization ( cp ) .",
    "vlbi observations in the mojave sample have revealed cp in about 15% of the observed sources , with a level of cp of the order of 0.5% of the local total intensity ( homan & lister 2006 ) .",
    "subsequent observations by gabuzda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and vitrishchak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) of the same sources for which cp was observed in the mojave sample show no disagreement in the sign of the cp , which supports the idea that the cp is indeed related to the intrinsic composition and magnetic field structure of agn jets . although a pair plasma can not generate intrinsic cp , the cp obtained by wardle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) through vlbi observations of 3c279 is explained if the cp is produced by faraday conversion .",
    "faraday conversion requires a low energy cutoff in the electron energy distribution and a pair plasma is required to avoid the jet carrying more kinetic energy than observed .    in these simulations ,",
    "helical magnetic fields are not included .",
    "this also is a major difference with rmhd simulations which have a helical magnetic field .",
    "therefore the results in this study may not cover all aspects of real extragalactic jets .",
    "nevertheless , the phenomena in this pic simulation study are based on the kinetic effects such as kkhi and mi which are not included in rmhd simulations . for example",
    ", hot - spots in frii jets could be explained due to particle ( electron ) acceleration due to kinetic instabilities .",
    "however , the size of jets in this study is very small compared to the real jets , therefore the macroscopic dynamics of jets may not be included fully .",
