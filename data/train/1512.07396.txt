    "with the latest precise measurement of the top quark mass and properties of the higgs boson , a  question of the stability of the higgs effective potential received a  renewed attention . using flat spacetime methods",
    ", various groups gauged the influence of the quantum effects on this subject , see for example @xcite and the references therein . on the other hand , since symptoms of the instability of the standard model ( sm ) vacuum appear at very high energy ( of the order of @xmath0gev )",
    ", the effect of the gravity may be also important .",
    "the aforementioned role of gravity in the problem of the stability was tackled , to some extent , using the effective operator approach @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the approach presented there , being based on a  non - covariant split of the spacetime metric on the minkowski background and graviton fluctuations , may be unsuitable for the energy scale of the order of @xmath1gev or above .",
    "one of the consequences of this may be the possibility that this method underestimates the importance of higher order curvature terms like for example squares of the ricci scalar , the ricci tensor and the riemann tensor which appear naturally if we demand a  one - loop renormalizability of the theory .",
    "recently , two other papers that consider the influence of gravity on the higgs effective potential appeared @xcite . in the latter , only the tree - level potential was considered , while calculations in the former were based on the assumption of a  flat minkowski background metric . for this reason",
    ", it was impossible to fully take into account the influence of the higher order curvature terms .",
    "after setting the problem of the stability of the sm vacuum in the frame of the hitherto existing attempts , let us discuss the framework we used .",
    "although calculations in the full sm is an ultimate goal , technical difficulties caused by the presence of many interacting fields are formidable .",
    "for this reason , we used a  simplified model consisting of a  real component of the higgs field , top quark and an additional real scalar singlet that may be considered as the mediator between the sm and the dark matter sector .",
    "we placed the matter model in the classical curved spacetime background that took the form of the friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson ",
    "walker metric . using the heat kernel method",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , we calculated the one - loop effective action for the considered model .",
    "this allowed us to find explicit forms of the gravity induced terms in the quantum corrected effective potential and to assess its influence on the problem of the vacuum stability .",
    "let us start the discussion of our results by writing down the bare tree - level action of the theory that we considered @xmath2 , \\\\",

    "our main goal was to investigate the influence of the classical gravitational field on the one - loop effective potential .",
    "to this end , we need to find both uv divergent terms ( that give rise to the running of coupling constants as defined by the appropriate renormalization group equations ) and the finite part of the one - loop effective action . to accomplish both of these tasks we used the heat kernel method @xcite , specifically the r - summed form of the proper time series representation of the heat kernel ( the schwinger - dewitt series ) @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to check that when we set all r - dependent terms in ( [ one_loop_v ] ) to zero we obtain the standard coleman - weinberg form of the one - loop effective potential .    to investigate the influence of the gravity induced terms",

    "in our investigations we ponder the question of the influence of the classical gravitational field on the form of the one - loop corrected scalar potential for the gauge - less top - higgs scalar mediator model .",
    "the approximation to the one - loop effective potential for the considered theory in the curved spacetime background was obtained and presented above as ( [ one_loop_v ] ) . from it",
    "we may see that , within the range of the validity of our approximation , the classical gravitational background will induce new terms in the aforementioned potential . in principle , these terms may influence both the small field region ( electroweak minimum ) and also the large field one ( the region for which the effective quartic coupling for the higgs field becomes negative ) .    as far as the region of the electroweak minimum",
    "is concerned , the results for the radiation dominated era are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    ", where @xmath27 is the top quark mass and the total energy density is given by the relation @xmath28.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    from the diagram we may infer that for the discussed setup gravity will contribute positively to the effective potential .",
    "this means that electroweak minimum becomes shallower",
    ".    on the other hand , to gauge the influence of gravity on the large field region we may do the following .",
    "first of all , let us note that from figure [ fig1 ] we see that the instability region starts on the @xmath29 axis . having this in mind , we may for now put @xmath29 in ( [ one_loop_v ] ) and define the effective quartic coupling of the higgs field in the presence of gravity as @xmath30 h^4 \\equiv \\frac{1}{4 } \\bar{\\lambda}^{eff}_{h}(r , h ) h^4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the effective field dependent quartic coupling defined in a  flat spacetime and @xmath32 is the field dependent coupling defined in the presence of gravity . in this definition we include only the term proportional to the kretschmann scalar @xmath33 since for the radiation dominated era other terms are zero or negligible @xcite .",
    "since the new term contributes positively to the @xmath32 , we may ask the question how big energy density should be to slightly improve the behavior of @xmath31 ? let us assume that for @xmath34gev the flat spacetime effective quartic coupling becomes small and negative . for concreteness , we took @xmath35 . using the relation ( [ r_rho ] ) we may exchange @xmath36 for the energy density ( remembering that for the radiation dominated era we have @xmath37 ) and find the value of the critical  @xmath38 for which @xmath39 . after an appropriate calculation one",
    "founds that @xmath40 this implies that if most of the energy of the matter system is stored in other field than the higgs itself ( which is a  typical situation in the radiation dominated era ) , then inclusion of the gravity induced terms in the effective potential may be of importance in analyzing the problem of the stability of the standard model .",
