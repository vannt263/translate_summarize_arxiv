    "no conclusive fact to support the origin for the full emission from hess  j1841@xmath0055 in any other wavelengths has been found .    in order to search for counterparts of hess  j1841@xmath0055 in x - ray , we investigated the region around hess  j1841@xmath0055 with _",
    "suzaku_. although _ suzaku _ covered only the southern half region of hess  j1841@xmath0055 , we found three diffuse sources .",
    "one is a soft and largely diffuse source with a thermal spectrum .",
    "another is small but has an extended hard x - ray emission with the emission line at 6.1  kev .",
    "the other is a largely extended source with a non - thermal spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we mainly report these new sources and discuss the possible relation to the gamma - ray emission .",
    "we performed observations in the hess  j1841@xmath0055 region with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) onboard the _ suzaku _ satellite @xcite in march 2011 ( obsids=505088010 , 505089010 , and 505090010 ) .",

    "the xis consists of four x - ray ccd cameras which cover the energy range of 0.212  kev .",
    "three of the cameras ( xis  0 , 2 , and 3 ) have front - illuminated devices and the remaining one ( xis  1 ) contains a back - illuminated device .",
    "all of the cameras are placed on the focal planes of the x - ray telescopes ( xrts ; @xcite ) .",
    "the whole region of xis  2 and one - fourth of xis  0 have been out of function since 2006 november and 2009 june , respectively , and hence the data from the remaining devices were used .",
    "the xis was working with the normal clocking mode without window option during all observations .",
    "we used the software packages heasoft v6.15.1 and xspec v12.8 for the data reduction and analysis .",
    "the xis event files were converted to pulse - invariant channels using the xispi software and the calibration database ( caldb ) version 2013 - 12 - 31 .",

    "since this source is a point source while hess j1841@xmath0055 is largely extended , the sfxt would only locally and partially responsible for the high energy gamma - ray emission of hess  j1841@xmath0055 @xcite .",

    "this pulsar , however , is largely offset from the main body of hess  j1841@xmath0055 , and hence could be at most partial ( or local ) origin of the tev emission .",
