    "solar flares are thought to be the result of magnetic reconnection in the corona , which releases vast amounts of energy within a few minutes ( up to hours in the largest events ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the released energy goes initially into the acceleration of suprathermal particles .",
    "nonthermal electrons streaming down along the loops from a coronal acceleration region are stopped in the lower atmosphere due to the steep density increase in the transition region toward the chromosphere . there",
    "they deposit the bulk of their kinetic energy in coulomb collisions with the ambient thermal electron population @xcite . as a consequence of this energy input",
    ", the chromospheric plasma is strongly heated and expands upward , filling the coronal loops , which are then observed via their enhanced soft x - ray ( sxr ) and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation .",
    "this process , known as `` chromospheric evaporation '' , was first proposed by @xcite to explain the observed correlation between the thermal and cumulated nonthermal flare emission .",
    "strongly blue - shifted components and line - asymmetries during the flare impulsive phase evidencing plasma upflows with speeds up to @xmath1300400  km  s@xmath0 have been first observed in spatially unresolved sxr spectroscopy from highly ionized ions formed at temperatures of @xmath2  k with the bent and bragg crystal spectrometer ( bcs ) onboard solar maximum mission ( smm ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and in spatially resolved euv line spectra by soho / cds .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the atmospheric response to electron - beam heating confirmed that strong blue - shifts in hot flare lines should be observed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models also predict a relation between the temperature and the expansion velocity of the evaporated plasma , which was recently confirmed from observations of a c - class flare with the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) onboard hinode covering a multitude of emission lines in the temperature range 0.0516  mk @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that these one - dimensional single - loop models predict that in the early flare phase the total line profile should be blue - shifted by several hundred kilometers per second , but the majority of the observations revealed only a blue asymmetry of the spectral lines indicating the presence of a strong static component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the observations can be reconciled with the numerical simulations if a multi - thread fine structure of the flaring atmosphere is accounted for in the modeling @xcite . in the multi - loop scenario ,",
    "chromospheric evaporation occurs sequentially in a number of individual threads that together make up a larger loop system that may appear as a single loop in x - ray or euv images . as a consequence ,",
    "the integrated emission of the newly heated loops ( subject to chromospheric evaporation plasma flows ) and the previously heated loops ( static ) do not reveal bulk motions .",
    "important observational diagnostics of the energy input by electron beams is provided by their hard x - ray ( hxr ) radiation , assumed to be thick - target bremsstrahlung of electrons scattered off the ions when impinging on the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the kinetic energy of the fast electrons is lost in coulomb collisions with the ambient thermal electrons , which is efficiently heating the flaring chromosphere . only a tiny fraction ( @xmath1@xmath3 ) of the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to hxr radiation when they are decelerated in the fields of the ions .",
    "however , it is the spatial and spectral distribution of this hxr bremsstrahlung , which provides us with important insight into the acceleration , transport , and energetics of electron beams in solar flares .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations predict that depending on the incident energy flux , the atmosphere responds by one of two means ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the energy deposition rate is too small to raise the chromospheric temperature beyond the peak of the radiative loss function at around @xmath4  k , the pressure can be raised by no more than a factor of 10 . in this case , the heated atmosphere moves slowly upwards at several tens of kilometers per second to adjust to a new equilibrium position , so - called `` gentle chromospheric evaporation '' .",
    "gentle evaporation may also be due to thermal conduction from the hot flaring corona , and was observed in small flares as well as in the preflare and late phase of larger events @xcite . for high energy flux densities ( @xmath5@xmath6 ergs  @xmath7  s@xmath0 ) , the chromosphere is unable to radiate away the deposited energy at a sufficient rate and is rapidly heated to coronal temperatures . in this case , the pressure increases by at least a factor of @xmath8 ( up to @xmath9 ) .",
    "consequently , the chromospheric plasma expands explosively upward into the loop at velocities of several hundred kilometers per second , in a process called `` explosive chromospheric evaporation '' .",
    "the overpressure of the hot evaporating plasma relative to the underlying chromosphere pushes cooler , more dense material downward at velocities of several tens of kilometers per second , establishing momentum balance with the hot plasma upflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such momentum balance was deduced from some flare observations to within an order of magnitude @xcite . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite studied the plasma flow behavior at different temperatures with cds high - cadence spectroscopy and finds a change from explosive to gentle evaporation during the m1.5 flare in his investigation .",
    "this change from explosive to gentle evaporation could be due to the atmosphere being heated and filled with evaporated material during the earlier event .",
    "this would reduce the amount of electron beam flux reaching the chromosphere during the second event , since due to the increased column density a larger part of low - energy electrons is already stopped in the coronal part of the loop @xcite .    in this paper , we study a well observed m2.5 flare that occurred on 2006 july 6 , and concentrate on the flare - induced chromospheric evaporation mass flows observed by cds , in comparison to the energy input by electron beams derived from hard x - ray data and the results of hydrodynamic simulations .",

    "in addition , we also have rhessi x - ray observations during the flare impulsive phase , which provide us with imaging and spectroscopy of the hot flaring plasma in the corona ( @xmath5@xmath2  k ) and allow us to deduce the energy input by flare - accelerated electron beams .    the paper is structured as follows . in sect .  2",

    "it is worth noting that the intensity peaks observed in adjacent cds pixels do not necessarily occur at the same time and with the same strength , due to the flare spatial / temporal evolution along the cds slit .",
    "a similar argument holds when we compare the cds intensities in the chromospheric ( hei ) and transition region lines ( ov ) with the rhessi hxr flux : the peaks are somehow related but do not occur simultaneously .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that in the rhessi light curves we observe the spatially integrated x - ray flux , whereas in the cds light curves constructed for individual pixels , we see the emission from a certain ( small @xmath41 ) subfield of the flaring region at a certain instant .",
    "the strongest hxr peaks occur between 08:2008:26  ut , with the increase of the nonthermal emission ( @xmath520  kev ) starting already around 08:18  ut ( see also the top panel in fig .",

    ", the cds slit is crossing the strongest energy deposition site along the southern flare ribbon , as is evidenced by the rhessi 2060 kev images as well as by the bright trace flare kernel within the spectrometer slit ( see fig .",

    "however , in 8 pixels on the lower end of the cds slit , we observe double components in the ov spectra roughly at this period ( 08:27:03 to 08:29:04  ut ) . in figure [ fig_double_comp ]",
    "we show the evolution of ov spectra in three selected cds pixels ( the same pixels , for which we show the intensities and velocities in fig .",
    "[ fig_cds_short ] ) which change from single to double component spectra , together with the single / double component gaussian fits .",
    "this spectral evolution is consistent with the bulk of the emission coming from a stationary plasma volume with an increasing contribution from upflowing plasma elements with velocities in the range of about @xmath44 to @xmath45  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "( the velocities of the first component lie all within the 3@xmath30 uncertainties , which we derived for the cds ov one - component fits ; these uncertainties are even larger for the double component fits .",
    "thus we interpret the velocity derived for this component as consistent with emission from a stationary plasma . )",
    "the upflow velocities obtained from the two - component fits are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_cds_short ] together with the velocities derived from the one - component fits .",

    ", we derive the temperature and emission measure of the hot flaring plasma as well as the spectral slope and power in electrons above a cut - off energy  @xmath46 for thick - target emission @xcite . the observed rhessi spectra ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_rhessi_spec ] ) indicate that the emission @xmath520  kev is dominated by nonthermal power - law emission .",
    "this is also consistent with the ( upper ) estimates of @xmath46 derived from the thick - target fits , which are in the range 15 to 25  kev .",
    "therefore , in the following we use a fixed value of @xmath47  kev to determine the kinetic energy of the fast electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig_rhessi_params ] shows the time evolution of the plasma and electron beam parameters obtained from the fits to the rhessi spectra integrated over consecutive 12  s intervals . from top to bottom we plot rhessi x - ray lightcurves , plasma temperature , plasma emission measure , electron spectral index , and power in electrons for a low - energy cut - off @xmath47  kev and for comparison also for @xmath48  kev .",
    "the temperature peaks already at the first ( small ) hxr burst around 08:19  ut , with a maximum value of 23  mk .",
    "emission measure is steeply growing until the largest hxr peak at 08:23  ut and then gradually increasing beyond the end of the enhanced rhessi hxr emission .",
    "such behavior of emission measure and temperature indicates that first a small volume of coronal plasma is heated to high temperatures , and subsequently more and more loops are filled with hot plasma .",
    "the electron spectra are comparatively steep , with the spectrum being hardest at the time of the largest rhessi peak at 08:23  ut with an electron spectral index @xmath49 .    in order to obtain the energy flux density in fast electrons",
    ", we also need the cross - sectional area of the electron beam , which we estimate from the hxr sources .",
    "hxr footpoint sizes were determined from rhessi images reconstructed over individual peaks in the 2060  kev band using the pixon and the mem - njit algorithms . for the highest rhessi peak during 08:2208:24  ut",
    "the derived area is in the range @xmath50  @xmath51 , and for the small peak during around 08:29  ut , which is accompanied by the highest upflow velocities observed by cds in the ov line , we find @xmath52  @xmath51 .",
    "the uncertainties of about a factor of 2 were obtained from the different image reconstruction algorithms . in fig .",

    "the comparison of the energy flux densities in electrons that we derived from the rhessi observations with the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the atmospheric response to electron beam heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that for the largest rhessi peak during 08:2208:24  ut the derived value of @xmath53  erg  s  @xmath0  @xmath7 is consistent with explosive chromospheric evaporation .",
    "@xcite estimated from their simulations a threshold between gentle and explosive evaporation of @xmath55  erg  s  @xmath0  @xmath7 .",
    "the cds measurements during this period show downflows in the range 2040  km  s@xmath0 in the `` cool '' lines formed in the chromosphere and transition region , while we observe upflows with line - of - sight velocities up to about @xmath42  km  s@xmath0 in the hot coronal si  xii line ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cds_short ] ) .",
    "this flow behavior in the different layers of the flaring atmosphere matches qualitatively the expectations for explosive chromospheric evaporation . during the explosive evaporation process",
    ", strong pressure gradients build up in the chromosphere / lower transition region driving plasma flows in both directions . due to the larger mass and inertia of the chromosphere ,",
    "the downflows are slower than the upflows of the hot plasma , establishing momentum balance .",
    "the characteristics of the transition region lines that we observed during this highest peak is in line with the results of @xcite , who detected short - lived ov transition region downflows at the locations of h@xmath10 flare kernels at the time of the strongest energy input ( as evidenced by the peak of the goes sxr flux derivative ) in all four flares of their study .",
    "in addition , these authors report that the intermediate temperature between chromospheric evaporation upflows and downflows is close to mg  ix ( 1.0  mk ) .",
    "the relatively small upflow velocities observed in the si  xii line ( @xmath23  k ) are basically in line with the recent hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite , who calculated the relation of the plasma flow velocities and the temperature .",
    "however , trace postflare loops ( see last two panels in fig .  [ fig_trace_rhessi ] ) indicate that actually the loop geometry relative to the cds slit is not very favorable to measure line - of - sight velocities in the corona , since the coronal loops cross the slit with a strong transversal component , and the coronal velocities derived from the si  xii line may be underestimated .",
    "we also note that the intensity behavior in the sixii line ( impulsive emission spike followed by a gradual increase , i.e.  a kind of neupert - effect - type plasma response ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_cds_short ] , bottom panels ) indicates that we observe the emission of plasma accumulating in the corona along the line - of - sight in the selected cds pixels , due to the chromospheric evaporation process .",
    "this is quite different to the impulsive peaks observed in hei and in ov ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cds_short ] , middle panels ) , where we observe the emission from narrow layers in the chromosphere and transition region , and the intensity increase occurs instantaneously and correlated with the energy input sequence .",
    "more interesting because difficult to reconcile with the `` simple '' explosive versus gentle evaporation picture is the plasma behavior when compared to the electron beam parameters derived for the small but distinct hxr burst at 08:29  ut . for the energy flux density in electrons",
    "we find @xmath54  erg  s  @xmath0  @xmath7 , which is a heating flux too small to drive explosive chromospheric evaporation according to the model results of @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that gentle chromospheric evaporation is at work , and the transition region is expected to slowly ablate with velocities of the order of some ten km  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , at that period we observe the highest upflow velocity in the ov transition region line during the event , with line - of - sight velocities up to @xmath45  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we note that we can not exclude the possibility that the power in the electron beam is actually higher than we derived in our analysis , since this quantity critically depends on the cross - sectional area of the hxr footpoints and the low - energy cut - off to the accelerated electron spectrum , which are both difficult to be exactly derived from the observations .",
    "the value we derived for the energy flux in electrons is actually close to the threshold between gentle and explosive evaporation .",
    "however , even in case that the energy flux in electrons would indeed suffice to drive explosive chromospheric evaporation , the cds observations can not straightforwardly be reconciled with the hydrodynamic modeling results of the flaring atmosphere in terms of explosive versus gentle evaporation because the velocity of 280  km  s@xmath0 in the ov transition region line is directed upward .",
    "it is also considerably higher than the upper limit derived by @xcite for the expansion velocity of explosive chromospheric evaporation , which is about 2.35 times the sound speed of the evaporating plasma .",
    "the formation temperature of the ov spectral line is @xmath56  k and the corresponding sound speed @xmath170  km  s@xmath0 , giving a limit to the expansion velocity of about 140  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we also stress that during these times , we observe in the ov transition region line contributions from both a stationary and a high - velocity upflowing plasma volume , in single cds pixels which have a size as small as @xmath41 , corresponding to an area of @xmath57  @xmath58 .",
    "this implies intriguing dynamics on fine - structured scales of the flaring atmosphere .",
    "double component spectra in transition region lines during a flare have been observed before in individual pixels during high - cadence cds sit - and - stare spectroscopic observing mode @xcite but  at least to our knowledge  have not been reported and studied in detail in spectra rastering over the flare region .",
    "this is most probably due to the very dynamic nature of the transition region during solar flares , which is difficult to capture in raster mode .",
    "it is also remarkable that this distinct intensity peak showing high upflow velocities in the ov transition region line is not accompanied by an intensity peak or plasma flows in the chromospheric hei line .",
    "this suggests that most of the electron beam energy is deposited in the transition region layers causing the strong plasma upflows there , and does not reach the chromosphere .",
    "finally , we note that the light curves extracted in individual cds pixels in the hei and ov spectral lines show several distinct peaks during the impulsive flare evolution .",
    "this implies that either a ) the same area of the solar atmosphere is energized several times during the event ( which is in conflict with the standard eruptive flare model , where magnetic reconnection driven by the erupting cme activates in sequence different magnetic loops further and further away from the magnetic inversion line ) , or b ) different loops are energized within the same pixel ( multi - thread scenario ) but can not be distinguished within the spatial resolution of the instruments .",
    "the multi - thread interpretation could also explain the double component spectra observed in individual cds pixels .",
    "in addition , in the multi - thread scenario the electron beam flux on individual threads would be larger than we estimated , and could potentially explain the large range of upflow velocities that is observed with each hard x - ray burst .",
    "we presented high - cadence cds spectroscopy combined with high - cadence imaging of the solar atmosphere in comparison with the energy input by fast electrons as derived from rhessi hxrs in an m2.5 flare . for the flare impulsive phase , the plasma flow behavior ( simultaneous downflows in the `` cool '' hei and ov lines formed in the chromosphere and transition region , and upflows in the hot coronal si  xii line ) as well as the derived energy deposition rate by electron beams are consistent with explosive chromospheric evaporation .",
    "however , for a later distinct hxr burst , where the strongest energy deposition site is exactly located on the cds slit , the situation is much more complex .",
    "the energy input by electrons is about an order of magnitude smaller than during the flare peak and too small to drive explosive chromospheric evaporation .",
    "however , at the same time we observe the highest upflow velocities in the ov transition region line during the event , up to 280  km  s@xmath0 , in addition to the contribution of a stationary plasma component within the same cds pixel .",
    "the upflow velocities are much too high for gentle ablation of the transition region .",
    "these findings indicate that the flaring transition region is extremely dynamic , complex and fine - structured on scales that are smaller than can be resolved with present instrumentation , and is thus probably not adequately captured by single - loop hydrodynamic simulations of the flaring atmosphere .",
