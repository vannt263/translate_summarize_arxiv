    "quantum entanglement is one of the most notable features of quantum systems and has been accepted as a key resource for quantum information processing  .",
    "the distribution of entanglement through quantum networks is therefore essential for the future of a variety of applications , ranging from quantum cryptography to quantum teleportation and distributed quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "however , the generation of these entangled states faces a severe obstacle .",
    "quantum channels such as free - space transmission or optical fibers are prone to loss and decoherence .",
    "this causes the desired maximally entangled states to degrade into mixtures and limits the distance over which the quantum information can be sent directly . to overcome these problems ` quantum repeater ' schemes",
    "have been proposed  @xcite which make use of the ability to ` purify '  @xcite and ` swap '  @xcite entanglement to maintain a high fidelity throughout .",
    "quantum repeaters are a promising tool for entanglement distribution , particularly since the amount of required physical resources increases only polynomially with the distance  @xcite , but operate in a 1d setup of network nodes .",
    "real networks are typically two-(or higher ) dimensional and it is therefore desirable to study if entanglement distribution can be made more efficient in these cases .    a scheme for entanglement distribution in higher dimensional networks was recently proposed by acn et al .",
    "@xcite in which ideas from classical bond percolation have been applied to regular , i.e. lattice - shaped , quantum networks .",
    "the scheme makes use of the networks connectivity and allows for the generation of maximally entangled singlet states between arbitrary points of the network , with a probability that is independent of their separation .",
    "the only requirement is that the nodes are initially connected by bipartite _",
    "pure _ states with sufficiently high entanglement .",
    "the restriction to pure states was made since a pure , partially entangled state can be converted into a singlet with finite probability via local operations and classical communication ( locc )  @xcite which is essential for the bond percolation protocol : initially one attempts to convert all bipartite pure states into a singlet which , in each case , succeeds with a certain probability . if this singlet conversion probability ( scp ) exceeds a lattice - geometry - dependent threshold , arbitrarily large clusters of singlet - connected nodes form which can successively be connected via entanglement swapping . in this way we can create a singlet between arbitrarily remote nodes in the network .",
    "however , it was pointed out in  @xcite that this process , known as classical entanglement percolation ( cep ) , is not optimal since certain quantum preprocessing schemes applied to the network can improve the scp  @xcite , and thus it is possible to apply bond percolation to lattices in which this would otherwise not be possible .",
    "clearly , the assumption of having a pure - state network is an idealization and in any practical situation the states connecting the nodes of the network will be mixed . in  @xcite the idea of entanglement percolation was applied to mixed states for the first time . in this paper",
    "we elaborate and extend the ideas presented in  @xcite .",
    "the networks we consider are composed of nodes , each of which can consist of several qubits , and may be connected by a finite number of bipartite mixed states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we aim to create a _",
    "perfect _ singlet between two arbitrary nodes in the network using a _",
    "finite _ amount of resources , i.e. a finite number of initial states which are converted into a singlet , which distinguishes our and other entanglement percolation schemes from , e.g. , the quantum repeater protocol where one aims to generate a state with high but non - unit entanglement fidelity .",
    "particularly we structure the paper as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that a perfect singlet can be generated in a network of arbitrary geometry the nodes of which are initially connected by bipartite mixed qubit states .",
    "we show that singlet generation between two nodes is possible _ if and only if _ they are connected by at least two ` paths ' consisting of a particular class of states .",
    "these states arise naturally in systems undergoing amplitude damping .",
    "thus our result is not only of theoretical but also of practical relevance .",
    "unfortunately , the proof does not deliver an efficient scheme for singlet generation .",
    "we therefore specialize in the remaining sections on networks with regular geometry , i.e. lattices in 2d and 3d and devise generalizations of entanglement percolation to the mixed states described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we briefly summarize the idea of classical entanglement percolation with pure states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we extend the concept of classical entanglement percolation to mixed states . to this end",
    "we consider regular networks where each node is connected to its neighboring nodes by a finite number of the mixed states introduced in sec .",
    "we present two different distillation protocols which are used to convert these states into a singlet with a probability above the percolation threshold of a variety of lattice geometries . after the distillation ,",
    "clusters of singlet - connected nodes emerge and we aim to create a singlet between two nodes in such a cluster by successive application of entanglement swapping . by communicating classically",
    "each node can determine if singlets exist between it and its neighboring nodes .",
    "this information can be communicated and stored classically in a central data processor .",
    "typically one would then use this information to apply a path - finding algorithm which locates a suitable ` path ' of singlets before swapping operations are performed . as an alternative to this",
    "we discuss a classical and a quantum protocol which merely require classical communication between neighboring nodes and basic computing within each node .",
    "the quantum protocol relies on the formation of many - qubit ghz states via local operations and classical communication with neighboring nodes and subsequent measurements at all nodes except the ones to be left in the final singlet .    in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we show that the idea of ` quantum preprocessing ' as it was successfully applied in pure state networks can be generalized to mixed states .",
    "in particular we devise a number of strategies on small networks which improve the scp , and we show that these smaller networks can be embedded into larger networks to enable cep which would otherwise not be possible . furthermore , we discuss ` hierarchical schemes ' , i.e. networks which are defined iteratively and were first discussed in  @xcite . also in these cases it turns out that quantum methods outperform classical percolation . finally , in sec .",

    "this is proven by partitioning the nodes into two groups with one containing a ( shaded region ) and the other b. for it to be possible to generate a singlet between a and b these groups must be linked by at least two states of the form  ( [ eq : state1 ] ) for all possible partitions.,width=226 ]    in this section we consider quantum networks of arbitrary geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the qubits in the nodes are ` connected ' by bipartite mixed states to qubits in other nodes .",

    "we will prove that the generation of a perfect singlet between two arbitrary nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 with finite probability in such a network is possible if and only if there are at least two paths of states linking @xmath0 and @xmath1 which have , up to local unitaries , the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 . we show this by separately proving a necessary and sufficient condition which , together , prove the above statement .",

    "appendix  [ app1 ] contains a concise proof of this fact based on  @xcite which agrees with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , that , in general , a singlet can not be generated with a finite probability from a finite number of mixed states .    with two states of the form  ( [ eq : state1 ] ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we obtain a singlet with a finite probability by first performing two c - not gates locally , with the @xmath8 state s qubits acting as the target qubits .",
    "these target qubits are then measured in the computational basis .",
    "if we find both qubits to be in the state @xmath9 we have generated a pure entangled state between the qubits that originally corresponded to the @xmath7 state .",

    "the state formed is @xmath10 i.e. @xmath11 is a schmidt - coefficient that has the value @xmath12 the probability that the pcm succeeds in generating this state is given by @xmath13 for identical states , i.e. @xmath14 , the pcm already yields a singlet .",
    "otherwise the state can be transformed into a singlet via the ` procrustean method '  @xcite that converts any pure 2-qubit state @xmath15 into a singlet @xmath16 with a probability @xmath17 .",

    "we can perform this partition of the network in an arbitrary way , as long as one group contains @xmath0 and the other contains @xmath1 . to be able to create a singlet between @xmath0 and @xmath1 via locc",
    "we must have at least two states of the form ( [ eq : state1 ] ) in _ all _ possible partitions .",

    "the states of the qubits that are not contained in this path are irrelevant and can therefore be in arbitrary states .     and classical communication between the nodes followed by local unitaries which causes @xmath19 and @xmath20 to become entangled.,width=188 ]    _ sufficient condition . _ in order to show this we make use of entanglement swapping .",

    "unfortunately for the other outcomes the states form is not generally maintained . note that if @xmath29 we can discard these cases by replacing the state with @xmath30 leading to an operation that transforms @xmath31 into @xmath32 which will be useful in sec .  [ sec5a ] .",
    "we can therefore create a state of the form  ( [ eq : state1 ] ) with non - zero probability between two nodes of the network , e.g. @xmath0 and @xmath1 in fig .",

    "the procedure is based on classical bond percolation , where we consider a regular lattice of nodes connected by identical quantum states , as shown in fig .",

    "recently , another method , that transforms the initial bipartite network into a probabilistic multipartite network , has also been shown to yield an improvement  @xcite .",
    "in this section we extend cep to mixed states . we consider regular lattices , e.g. triangular ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , square , or even lattices in higher dimensions .",

    "we will assume that the states forming edges are of the form  ( [ eq : state1 ] ) with @xmath45 .",
    "setting @xmath45 is not a major restriction but allows us to keep the equations manageable .",

    "the @xmath59 line ( dashed ) corresponds to the dss scheme .",
    "the percolation thresholds for triangular ( t ) , square ( s ) and honeycomb ( h ) lattices are given by the horizontal lines . , width=302 ]    an extension of this scheme to @xmath48 identical copies of pmss @xmath51 yields the scp @xmath60 a derivation of this formula is given in appendix  [ app2 ] . as a particular example",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss the case of three states in more detail . in this case",
    "the measurement at @xmath0 is given by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) with the elements @xmath61 the measurement at @xmath1 then depends on this outcome and creates a maximally entangled state with a certain probability .",
    "the scp is obtained by setting @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : gp - probfn ] ) and is given by @xmath62 comparing this with the @xmath50 case [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : scp2 ] ) ] shows an increase in the success probability which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the dashed line represents the scp for three identical states .",
    "the scp using the dss scheme does generally increase with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "however , the scheme does not make use of the available resources in the best way .",
    "indeed , the scp @xmath63 can be significantly improved by grouping @xmath48 identical pmss into sets of @xmath64 and converting each of these sets into a singlet .",
    "for example for @xmath65 we apply the pcm as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] on pairs of states which converts them into singlets with a probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) . if this fails for a given pair we may still find both measured qubits in the state @xmath66 and have generated another pms .",
    "this pms can then be used again in another purification attempt . to be more precise , starting with @xmath48 copies of a state @xmath51 ( with @xmath67 )",
    "we apply a 2-state purification protocol on groups of two .",
    "if no singlet is obtained the procedure is repeated on the remaining pmss as illustrated in fig .",
    "the coefficients for the pmss after @xmath68 repetitions , when no singlet is created , are given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for states of the form @xmath72 the probability of obtaining a pms is @xmath73 .",
    "if the pcm yields two qubits that are measured in different states the purification step between the two pmss has completely failed .",
    "the probability of this is given by @xmath74 .",
    "the probability of not generating a singlet using this _ recycling protocol _ on @xmath48 states of the form @xmath75 is then found to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , the probability of successfully generating a singlet by applying the procedure to @xmath48 states of the form @xmath51 is @xmath78 which is calculated iteratively .",
    "examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath79 .",
    ".,width=302 ]    obviously , the states do not necessarily need to be split into pairs .",
    "for example we can separate all of the states into sets of three and apply the three - state dss distillation . in case of failure this can yield a pms state as well , which can then be used in later distillation steps .",
    "there are a variety of ways to combine the three - state distillation with the two - state recycling scheme . here",
    "we concentrate on the straightforward approach which only uses the three - state distillation on every level of the recycling scheme .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen in most cases the two - state recycling scheme has a higher chance of success and because of this we will focus on the pairing arrangement in this paper .      using the purification procedures described above we can apply cep , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , for lattice networks with multi - edged bonds . in most cases",
    "it is advantageous to use the two - state recycling scheme , except for @xmath59 where the dss scheme should be used . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it can be seen that the scp increases with the number of edges per bond and this allows for a larger range of values for @xmath80 and @xmath41 such that cep is successful . for double edged bonds",
    "the optimal probability of generating a singlet is given by @xmath81 when the bonds are composed of three edges , i.e. three pmss between nodes , we have @xmath82 by comparing these ranges to the percolation thresholds we see that a basic successful setup is a double bonded triangular lattice ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the double bonds can be converted to singlets and if the chance of this is larger than the percolation threshold an infinite cluster will form .",
    "a singlet can then be created between any two nodes within the cluster .",
    "thus percolation occurs if @xmath83 however , the singlet conversion probability never exceeds @xmath84 for two states .",
    "therefore we would require more states in other geometries .",
    "for example , if we have three - edged bonds between each neighboring node we can apply cep to a square lattice .",
    "this is because there are parameters such that @xmath85 .",
    "analogously , cep is also possible in honeycomb lattices with three edges per bond",
    ".          the process of creating singlets , randomly replacing the initial network bonds , can be run if each node can only communicate classically with their neighbors .",
    "each node then knows if a qubit that it contains is part of a singlet after this procedure has finished .",
    "this information can be stored classically within a node but after the bonds are distilled we are faced by the problem of finding a set of singlets that connect our requested nodes , @xmath0  and  @xmath1 .",
    "if all of the singlet generation data is collected by a ` controller ' then an efficient path finding algorithm can be applied to determine a suitable ` path ' of singlets linking the nodes .",
    "an example of a suitable algorithm would be a dijkstra scheme  @xcite such as the a * path finding algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the path information can then be used to instruct the correct nodes to perform swapping .",
    "the swapping operations are performed in order from node @xmath0 to @xmath1 , so that the measurement outcomes only need to be communicated along the chain , between neighboring nodes .",
    "however this procedure requires one classical computer to have complete knowledge of the network .",
    "instead , it is interesting to note that this does not need to be the case as there are algorithms which do not require any more classical communication than this ` controller ' method , indeed they do not require a central ` controller ' at all .",
    "this can be done not only classically but also via a quantum algorithm using multipartite entanglement which we will introduce below .",
    "a classical path - finding method would use a type of breadth - first search algorithm called a burning algorithm  @xcite .",
    "node @xmath0 sends a ` burning ' signal to its neighboring nodes connected by singlets .",
    "these nodes keep a record of where they received the signal from and send out an identical signal to the other nodes that they are connected to .",
    "we say that the node has ` burned ' .",
    "if it has already received a signal from a different node then the additional signal is ignored .",
    "this continues outwards from @xmath0 , ` burning ' the nodes .",
    "once node @xmath1 receives the signal it replies to the node it came from with a ` swapping ' message .",
    "this node can then perform a swapping operation and send another ` swapping ' signal , together with the bell - measurement outcome , back to the node it received a ` burning ' signal from .",
    "the path can then be traced back along the nodes with swapping performed at each step until node @xmath0 is reached .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 can determine if the protocol has been successful .",
    "however , @xmath0 and @xmath1 may not be in the same cluster and they do not know if the protocol has failed when the network is of infinite size .",
    "this is not a problem for finite networks , containing @xmath86 nodes , as @xmath0 and @xmath1 can time the steps taken and if these exceed @xmath87 they both know they are not in the same cluster .",
    "note that no extra information actually needs to be transmitted .",
    "we can combine the burning algorithm with the process of transmitting the distillation protocol information .",
    "for example , in a double edged network of identical edges , @xmath0 can perform her pcm and if @xmath9 is the outcome she assumes she has a singlet and sends a burning signal to the node that would contain the singlet s other qubit .",
    "if a node receives this signal it can perform its pcm and determine if there is a singlet there . when there is and if it is the first instance for the node it should record that entry qubit and repeat the process , performing a pcm on the remaining qubits and sending signals to those with the @xmath9 outcome .",
    "once @xmath1 receives a signal it can check that a singlet has been created with a pcm and then send a swapping signal back as before . during the swapping , a node can use the bell - measurement information received to indicate that a swapping is required so no explicit ` swapping ' signal is required either .",
    "all of this information transfer would have been necessary as well if a controller algorithm would have been used .",
    "hence the generation of the singlet can be accomplished by defining rules for each node and allowing them to run with nearest neighbor classical communication .",
    "this is fundamentally different to the controller process and has made use of parallel computation to find a path that no single node has full knowledge of .    we will now consider an alternative , quantum algorithm that is based on the burning algorithm and makes use of multipartite entanglement in the network .",
    "the protocol starts after we attempted to convert all bonds into singlets and every node has knowledge about its singlet connections to nearest neighbors .",
    "we build up a progressively larger multi - qubit ghz state , defined by @xmath88 , spread between the ` burned ' nodes by adding qubits in each burning step .",
    "building up such a state requires joining two ghz states , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , to create @xmath91 ( note that a singlet equals @xmath92 ) .",
    "this is done by performing a cnot gate between a qubit in @xmath89 and a target qubit in @xmath90 , measuring the target qubit in the @xmath93-basis , communicating the measurement result to the other qubits in @xmath90 and performing a unitary operation on them depending on the outcome .    .",
    "this procedure uses the operation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] to add qubits to the ghz state .",
    "the black squares depict qubits that are part of the ghz state .",
    "arrows represent a message to add nodes to the ghz state along singlet paths .",
    "each node keeps a record of the node from which it received this message from , symbolized here by a white dot .",
    "when a node can not extend the ghz state any further ( highlighted by a dashed outline ) it measures its qubits in the @xmath94 basis ( open squares ) and sends this information back towards @xmath0 ( thin arrows ) along the route recorded .",
    "certain nodes are selected beforehand not to perform the measurement ( here @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and these will form the resulting ghz state . at each node the incoming data can be combined and sent back along one path if the routes branch .",
    "once this data returns to @xmath0 a phase operation can be performed on the qubit there to correct for any errors and the final ghz state ( here a singlet between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) will remain.,width=302 ]    now we perform the same process as for the ` burning algorithm ' , however , as each node is ` burned ' it is connected to the ghz state spread over the previously burned nodes . the process to do this",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and consists of joining the singlets partially contained in that node to the ghz state . within each node",
    "one qubit is left entangled with the ghz state .",
    "after this operation has been run for a maximum of @xmath95 times all of the nodes in the cluster containing @xmath0 have a qubit from a single ghz state .    at each node",
    "a record is kept of the bond via which it has been included into the ghz state . if there is a singlet between two nodes that are being burned then",
    "the singlet is ignored .",
    "furthermore we add the rule that whenever a node can not extend the ghz state anymore @xmath94 basis measurements are performed along the recorded path back to @xmath0 .",
    "this removes a qubit from the ghz state but introduces a phase error in the remaining ghz state depending on the outcomes of the measurement .",
    "the information about these measurement outcomes has to be sent back along the path to @xmath0 .",
