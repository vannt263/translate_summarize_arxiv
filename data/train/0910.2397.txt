    "type ia supernova and other astrophysics observations together indicate that our universe is accelerating now @xcite .",
    "different models are proposed to try to describe or understand this surprisingly exotic phenomenon .",
    "if we make the assumption that general relativity is still correct to the scale of cosmos , an effective term contributes to negative pressure should be added to the right hand side of einstein s field equation in the general theory of relativity to explain the recent stage speed - up of our observational universe expansion .",
    "this is the basic idea to the so called dark energy concept .",
    "so far for the ten years old de phenomena there are many both theoretical and observational attempts to understand the mechanism .",
    "the introduction of the cosmological constant corresponds to a negative pressure fluid with a specially constant density all the time which has been playing a key role in the universe evolution by uniformly distributed over the whole cosmic space - time and media , but the cosmological constant existence raises serious fundamental physics problem , the so - called cosmological constant problem for both new ( coincidence ) and old ( so tiny ) ones .",
    "another class of models try to modify the traditional einstein s general theory of relativity to the large cosmology scale , by arguing that the recently appearing acceleration phase of the unverse expansion comes from the break down of general relativity in cosmic scale . the so - called @xmath4 gravity , to mention one for example , which generalizes the hilbert - einstein action is categorized in this class @xcite .",
    "( for more details and references , you may see the recent reviews @xcite @xcite ) .    in the context of perfect fluid ,",
    "some models based on fluid mechanics method are studied extensively , such as the chaplygin gas and generalized chaplygin gas models which modify the equation of state , and barotropic fluids dark energy @xcite .",
    "also for the purpose to consider more realistic situation in the evolution of the universe , the concept of viscosity is introduced into the investigation of the cosmos evolution from fluid mechanics @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "earlier attempt @xcite in this area even `` predicts '' the late acceleration of the universe expansion .",
    "the dissipative effect in the fluid is always due to shear and bulk viscosity characterized by shear viscosity parameter @xmath5 and bulk viscosity parameter @xmath6 . in the study of cosmology , the shear viscosity disappears in the friedmann - robertson - walker s isotropic and homogeneous framework with the largest spherical symmetry .",
    "only bulk viscosity could play a role in the realistic models .",
    "its effects can be shown from an added correction term with the minus sign to cosmic pressure @xmath7 .",
    "this composite formula motives the trial on the connection between bulk viscosity of the cosmic fluid and dark components ( energy and matter ) .",
    "as we understand so far that purely gravitational probes can only provide information on a single effective matter - energy fluid , which may consist of the dark energy and ( dark ) matter composites as well as the least dominated radiation energy at present universe , so for the dominated two functioning dark components we can describe them as a single dark fluid @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss a concrete unified model building by paying attention on the modification of the cosmic media from the simple assumption as a perfect fluid to a piratical viscous fluid encoded in the energy - stress tensor contents , that is , at the right hand side of the einstein s field equation . for the bulk viscosity de model building a remark",
    "is needed here .",
    "considering the observational dark energy ingredient fraction today , it takes about @xmath8 of the whole matter - energy density , so the corresponding pressure provided by the bulk viscosity correction dominantly surpasses the remaining pressure contributions from other cosmic energy - matters .",
    "this is obviously different from the traditional non - equilibrium thermodynamics , in which the viscosity contribution is only a little correction to the pressure term .",
    "some researches try to find a mechanism to support such a fluid behavior by a kind of non - standard interaction introduced between the dark matter and energy components @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is certainly important for these attempts to find more support or hints behind cosmic observations in the study of bulk viscosity cosmology along this possible line .    for concrete model building , detailed form of viscosity parameter",
    "is needed to settle down the theoretical framework . in the reference @xcite , a scale factor dependent viscosity",
    "is proposed , which is different from the only density dependent form @xmath9 it could be shown that it is equivalent to a modified equation of state(eos ) @xmath10 and other interesting physical properties have been investigated in that kind of models @xcite @xcite . in this present paper , by largely extending its contents we will continue the study of a redshift dependent viscosity form @xmath0 as proposed in the previous work @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the late time singularity discussion and its entropy expression of the bulk viscosity de model . for the phantom dark energy model",
    ", there exists a cosmic singularity in the future cosmos evolution , that is , the so - called cosmic `` doomsday '' . as shown below",
    ", we could see that this viscosity de model represents different evolution behaviors , and the future cosmic singularity will disappear under some proper parameter ranges selection . from this view of point , the model has the flexibility to produce either quintessence or phantom properties , that is , we can easily achieve its eos either larger or less than characteristic -1 .",
    "an important tool for investigating dark energy model characters nowadays is by the introduction of some geometry quantities , for instance the statefinder diagnostic parameters @xcite , which are quantities dependent on high order derivatives of the scale factor , such as to the @xmath11 .",
    "the usual statefinder parameter pair \\{@xmath3 } of the model concerned is calculated explicitly to demonstrate the viscosity de model behaviors . in our previous work ,",
    "deceleration parameter and @xmath2 diagnostic parameter @xcite are performed to show the properties .",
    "we have found that in statefinder pair plane , our model and @xmath1cdm model could be easily discriminated in some redshift ranges .",
    "we prospect that increasing the quality and quantity of measurement data will enhance our ability to make accurate discrimination of different current cosmology models and rule out some . at the same time , new diagnostic methods merit further investigations , especially diagnostic quantity in the higher order perturbation level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section , some general features and remarks about viscosity dark energy model are given , and we further discuss the redshift dependent model . in the third section , we give the singularity discussion of our model .",
    "some solutions are given there . in sec .",
    "* iv * , we calculate entropy of this viscosity model . finally , conclusion and discussions are presented .",
    "we leave the data fitting procedure in the appendix .",
    "as well - known so far , the general theory of relativity for gravity and standard model for particle physics are very successful to describe the universe phenomena before the astrophysics exotic behaviors discovered , such as the roughly flat rotation curves for the spiral galaxies at large distance and the speed - up for the universe expansion at current stage evolution that are now commonly attributed as the cosmic `` dark '' physics evidences .",
    "the cosmic dark sector , often divided as mainly the dark energy and dark matter parts , consists of about @xmath12 of the total cosmic ingredients and we know that purely gravitational probes are blind to the two main `` flavors '' , that is the dark matter and dark energy can not be separated clearly .",
    "so at present evolution stage for our physical universe , a single unified dark fluid follows to describe the main cosmic media . in the friedmann robertson walker metric the cosmic fluid",
    "is usually described by its homogenous and isotropic density @xmath13 as well as the pressure @xmath14 , that is , the pressure @xmath14 can be divided into two additive parts ( dark energy and matter ) at least : @xmath15 here we assume that other cosmic components , such as radiation and curvature contributions , are negligible as they may play un - important roles in our present description to the late universe evolution .",
    "it may be a simplifying view to treat cosmic fluid dividedly , but we consider that it is a more practical way for modeling dark energy and dark matter in a unified single fluid for the study of the late universe evolution .",
    "also in our concrete viscosity de model building , the usual assumption that cosmic fluid simply is perfect is not kept .",
    "instead , we assume that the cosmic fluid for current universe evolution is better described by a single non - perfect fluid encoded with bulk viscosity effects .",
    "therefor the modified pressure with viscosity term can be written directly as : @xmath16 where @xmath6 is the bulk viscosity parameter .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that the relation between single fluid and multi - fluid framework , that is , in the multi - fluid case , the dark energy pressure @xmath17 comes mainly from a bulk viscosity term added to the perfect fluid .",
    "this treatment could also be regarded as an effective method which revises the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "if we set thermodynamics index @xmath18 in this paper , the cosmic pressure is mainly due to the viscous effects . using the friedman equation",
    ", we can get the revised equation of state for the relatively complex cosmic fluid : @xmath19 where in the equation above @xmath20 .",
    "+ if we define the effective eos as usual @xmath21 , then in this case : @xmath22 with the aim to be consistence with current astrophysics observation results , the value of equation of state today should be @xmath23 where the sub script zero indicates today s value , so that , @xmath24 if we fix the equation of state , that is , @xmath25 is a constant @xmath26 , we can have an interesting relation from eq.(6 ) @xmath27 three aspects on the viscosity de model building are detailed below .      for consistent with observation data , especially supernova data ,",
    "we need calculate the integration of hubble parameter , such as quantity like @xmath28 , so to obtain more knowledge on @xmath29 is certainly very useful . with the improved data quality and quantity of direct @xmath29 parameter observations",
    "( like the hubble space telescope project now running in the sky ) we can use this better constrained hubble rate in the fitting procedures to get more information on our observational universe evolution .",
    "the conservation equation with a viscosity term is : @xmath30 with the friedman equation , we can rewrite the conservation equation in terms of a hubble parameter : @xmath31 using the relation @xmath32 , we can write the above formula as a differential equation to the scale factor : @xmath33 its form solution is thus obtained as a general integral function of the scale factor : @xmath34\\mathrm{exp}\\big(-\\int\\frac{3}{2a}{\\mathrm{d}}a\\big).\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath35 is an integral constant . for",
    "a different viscosity form @xmath36 given out , we could derive a concrete hubble parameter expression accordingly .",

    "best fitting results with available observational data in previous work @xcite is consistence with identifying the coefficient of this term as dark matter mass ratio @xmath40 .      when the bulk viscosity parameter is specified , we could discuss cosmology with the unified dark energy evolution behaviors",

    "the aid of this procedure is to determine the value of @xmath174 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the shift parameter @xmath175 inferred from cmb power spectrum of wmap year five data and the distance parameter @xmath176 from the bao data of lss , like sdss and 2df , are considered to give effective contributions to the joint statistical data fitting .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath175 is defined in refs.@xcite and @xcite as @xmath177 and wmap5 results @xcite have updated the redshift of recombination to be at @xmath178 .",
    "its detail meaning can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the distance parameter @xmath176 is given by @xmath179 where commonly value @xmath180 is used .    jointly taking into considering parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176",
    ", we can soundly use the total @xmath181 to make the best fitting analysis : @xmath182 so far this is the most acceptable joint statistical data analysis method for exploring the de mystery and for the de cosmology model buildings to confront with the astrophysics observational data sets obtained .",
    "complementary with the increasing amount and accuracy of lensing , cluster survey and others data sets to be obtained we are confident it will be not far away to pin down the relative young dark energy and long standing dark matter identities , and eventually to solve the dark sector puzzles with possible new discoveries .",

    "<S> the de model evolution behavior and tendency are shown in the plane of the statefinder diagnostic parameter pair \\{@xmath3 } where the fixed point represents the @xmath1cdm model . the possible singularity property in this bulk viscosity cosmology is also discussed to which we can conclude that in the different parameter regions chosen properly , this concrete viscosity de model can have various late evolution behaviors and the late time singularity could be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the cosmic entropy in the bulk viscosity dark energy frame , and find that the total entropy in the viscosity de model increases monotonously with respect to the scale factor evolution , thus this monotonous increasing property can indicate an arrow of time in the universe evolution , though the quantum version of the arrow of time is still puzzling . </S>"
