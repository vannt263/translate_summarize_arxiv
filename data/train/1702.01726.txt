    "@xcite , the pqds are completely determined by the transverse momentum dependent distributions @xmath18 .",
    "thus , our next goal is to find the twist-2 part @xmath19 of the total tmd . using the formalism of virtuality distribution functions ( vdfs ) @xcite we find the explicit form of such a tmd [ it coincides with the results of earlier studies @xcite based on a particular on - mass - shell ansatz for the parton - hadron blob @xmath20 .",

    "our further study shows that the twist-2 part is not the only source of kinematic target - mass corrections : they also come from the higher - twist contributions . after incorporating the analysis of target - mass dependence for feynman diagrams in the and studying equations of motion for the full tmd @xmath18",

    ", we also find the parts of the relevant vdf and tmd . in section 4 , we study the @xmath29-dependence of higher - twist contributions and equations of motion for tmds . since the basic relations between various types of parton distributions are rather insensitive to complications brought in by spin , in sections we refer to a simple scalar model . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss modifications related to quark spin and gauge nature of gluons in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath31 modification of models for soft tmds used in ref .",

    "it is proportional to @xmath255 , i.e. , we still have it , as it is caused by the virtuality of the active quarks . in a yukawa gluon model",
    ", we have @xmath256 , and this violation will be compensated when one includes terms coming from the 3-body @xmath257 diagrams , provided that one imposes the restriction ( [ eqmocon7 ] ) .      in qcd , one should take the operator @xmath258 involving the gauge link @xmath259 along the straight line connecting @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "the equation of motion , applied to the relative coordinate @xmath5 , takes the form @xmath262 where @xmath263 as a result , we have @xmath264 taking again @xmath265 reduces the equation of motion to the equation for @xmath266 involving a scalar function @xmath267 , and we can use all the results of section 3 , since the explicit form of @xmath268 was not essential there .",
    "thus , if one uses the vdf / tmd representations ( [ newvdfx ] ) , ( [ newvdfx3 ] ) for matrix elements , there are no kinematic @xmath190-corrections that are artifacts of expansion over traceless @xmath202 combinations .",
    "furthermore , the pqds are given by the conversion formula ( [ qtmd ] ) , and the target - mass dependence of @xmath56 may only come from that of @xmath82 .    according to the general statement made at the end of section 2 , the tmds @xmath82 _ must _ depend on @xmath21 through the combination .",
    "this is a `` predictable '' or `` kinematical '' target - mass dependence .",
    "we also noted there that @xmath82 may also have a `` dynamical '' @xmath29-dependence due to the @xmath29-dependence of the underlying function @xmath269 of eq .",

    "this kind of can not be derived from kinematics , and in this sense it is `` unpredictable '' . in principle , there is nothing special in the fact that @xmath269 depends on the hadron mass , just like there is no wonder that the shape of a pdf @xmath12 may be different if the hadron mass would be different .",
    "this is to say that some part of the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath269 may be absorbed into the form of the pdf @xmath12 , and would not lead to @xmath10 corrections describing the difference between a qpd @xmath30 and its pdf @xmath4 .",
    "still , some part of the unpredictable @xmath29-dependence may lead to the @xmath10 corrections , and it is a challenge to build vdf models that would `` realistically '' reflect that part of the @xmath29-dependence .    leaving this problem for future studies , in what follows we will investigate the consequences of the `` mandatory '' change @xmath270 in the tmd models that have been used for generating nonperturbative evolution of pqds in our paper @xcite .      adding the @xmath29-dependence into our gaussian model ( [ gaussian ] ) by the @xmath271 prescription , we get @xmath272 where @xmath273 .",
    "thus , we have a simple change in the form of the pdf , @xmath274 , that would not be reflected by @xmath10 terms in the difference between @xmath275 and @xmath276 .      another vdf model proposed in ref .",

    "the model ( [ psixm ] ) gives @xmath289      now we have two parameters , the nucleon mass @xmath0 and the transverse momentum scale @xmath57 , and we need to decide what is their ratio . to this end",

    "the factor @xmath292 changes from 1.1 to 1.3 in this region .",
    "thus , the average transverse momentum is predominantly determined by @xmath57 . assuming a folklore value of 300 mev for the average @xmath161 , we take @xmath293 .    to illustrate the impact of the @xmath29 terms in eq .",
    "( [ qinm ] ) on the shape of quasi - distributions , we take again @xmath294 , and compare curves for @xmath293 and @xmath295 at @xmath296 ( i.e. @xmath297 ) . as one",

    "[ fmx2 ] ) , still being rather far from the asymptotic @xmath300 shape .",
    "thus , in this scenario , when one reaches the momentum @xmath17 that is sufficiently large to stop the nonperturbative evolution of the qpd @xmath8 , there is no need to bother about target mass corrections .",

    "we have established that tmds @xmath305 must depend on @xmath21 through the @xmath27 combination .",
    "hence , the @xmath306 addition here may be considered as a kinematic target - mass correction .",
    "furthermore , tmds may have a dynamic that can not be predicted from kinematical considerations . just like the form of the @xmath21-dependence of the tmds , this part of the @xmath29-dependence",
    "can only be modeled in our approach .",
    "we have studied the effect of the @xmath31 modification of the tmd models used in our paper @xcite , and found that the @xmath10 corrections become negligible well before the pqd curves @xmath8 become close enough to the corresponding pdf @xmath4 .",

    "a possible future extension of our findings is an application of the vdf / tmd approach to inclusive dis , with the goal to investigate if the target - mass corrections described there by the nachtmann variable @xcite are a genuine feature of the process or just an artifact of the twist decomposition .",
