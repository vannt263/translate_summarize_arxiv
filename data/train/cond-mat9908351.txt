    "in the last few decades we have witnessed a paradigmatic shift regarding the role of fluctuations , from the equilibrium picture of merely being a @xmath3 perturbation on thermodynamic averages  or triggering at most phase transitions between well defined minima of the free energy @xcite  to lead a host of new and amazing phenomena in far from equilibrium situations . as examples",
    "we may cite noise - induced unimodal - bimodal transitions in some zero - dimensional models @xcite , stochastic resonance in zero - dimensional and extended systems @xcite , noise - induced spatial patterns @xcite , noise - delayed decay of unstable states @xcite , ratchets @xcite , shifts in critical points @xcite , etc .",
    "recently it has been shown that a white and gaussian _ multiplicative _ noise can lead an _ extended _ dynamical system ( fulfilling appropriate conditions ) to undergo a _ phase _ transition towards an _ ordered _ state , characterized by a nonzero order parameter and by the breakdown of ergodicity @xcite . this result  first obtained within a curie  weiss - like mean - field approximation , and further extended to consider the simplest correlation function approach  has been confirmed through extensive numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition to its _ critical _ nature as a function of the noise intensity @xmath2 , the newly found noise - induced phase transition has the noteworthy feature of being _ reentrant _ : for each value of @xmath1 above a threshold one , the ordered state exists only inside a window @xmath4 $ ] . at variance with the known case of _ equilibrium _ order - disorder transitions that are induced ( in the simplest lattice models ) by the nearest - neighbor coupling constant @xmath1 and",
    "rely on the bistability of the local potential , the transition in the case at hand is led by the _ combined effects _ of @xmath1 and @xmath2 through the nonlinearities of the system .",
    "neither the zero - dimensional system ( corresponding to the @xmath5 limit ) nor the deterministic one ( @xmath6 ) show any transition .",
    "this counterintuitive ordering role of noise has also been found afterwards in different models in the literature @xcite . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the authors study a noise - induced reentrant transition in a time - dependent ginzburg  landau model with both additive and multiplicative noises .",
    "ref.@xcite introduces another simple model with a purely multiplicative noise , which also presents a noise - induced reentrant transition .",
    "this reference also gives evidence that the universality class of its critical behavior is that of the _ multiplicative noise _",
    "@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a discussion of the universality class of these models ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a first - order phase transition induced by noise is obtained in a system of globally coupled oscillators .",
    "a similar first - order phase transition is also found in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , ref.@xcite addresses the role of multiplicative noise in the context of phase - separation dynamics .",
    "although for the sake of mathematical simplicity all these references ( in particular , refs.@xcite ) studied only the white - noise case ( the only exception is reference @xcite in which colored noise in space , white in time , is considered ) it is expected that , because of their nature , fluctuations coupled _ multiplicatively _ to the system will show some degree of time - correlation or `` color '' @xcite , and hence new effects may arise from this fact .",
    "for example , a reentrant behavior has been found recently as a consequence of color in a noise - induced transition @xcite and an ordering nonequilibrium phase transition can be induced in a ginzburg  landau model by varying the correlation time of the additive noise @xcite . thus motivated ,",
    "we have studied the consequences of a _ finite _ ( but still very short as compared with the `` deterministic '' or coarse - grained time scales ) self - correlation time @xmath0 of the multiplicative noise in systems of this kind .",
    "we now recall some of the new effects that emerge in this colored - noise case , which have been briefly reported in a recent work @xcite :    * our main finding is that , as a consequence of the multiplicative character of the noise , a strong enough spatial coupling @xmath1 leads invariably ( for @xmath7 ) to a _ disordered _ state , contrary to what would be expected to happen in equilibrium statistical - mechanical models . * another important result is that , except for large values of @xmath2 and _ very small _ values of @xmath0 , color has an _ inhibiting _ role for ordered states .",
    "moreover , there exists a _",
    "finite _ and not very large value of @xmath0 beyond which order is impossible .",
    "these results represent a major departure from what one can expect on the basis of equilibrium thermodynamics , according to which one should tend to think that as @xmath8 an _ ordered _ situation is favored .",
    "whereas that `` intuitive '' notion remains valid if the multiplicative noise that induces the nonequilibrium ordering phase transition is white @xcite , it ceases to be so for @xmath7 .",
    "in the former case , the results could be interpreted in terms of a `` freezing '' of the short - time behavior by a strong enough spatial coupling : for @xmath9 , the stationary probability distribution could be considered to be @xmath10-like , just as the initial one . in our case",
    ", an analysis of the short - time behavior of the order parameter up to first order in @xmath0 reveals that the disordering effect of @xmath1 can only be felt for _ nonzero _ self - correlation time . as @xmath0 increases , the minimum value of @xmath1 required to stabilize the disordered phase decreases and the region in parameter space available to the ordered phase shrinks until it vanishes .",
    "thus , the foregoing results can only be interpreted once we recall that the ordered phase arises from the cooperation of _ two _ factors : the presence of spatial coupling _ and _ the multiplicative character of the noise ( which may eventually lead to `` counterintuitive '' results ) .",
    "it is our purpose in this work to render an explicit account of our calculation and , at the same time , to expose and to discuss the results more thoroughly . after presenting the model in section [ model ] , we begin section [ approx ] by introducing the approximations needed to render the problem accessible to mathematical analysis .",
    "we resort to a mean - field approximation like in refs.@xcite and to a  unified colored noise approximation \" ( ucna ) @xcite , devised to deal with self - correlated noises . in section",
    "[ simpler ] a simplified treatment using the aforementioned approximations is given and in section [ refined ] we expose the more sophisticated approach that was actually used to obtain the phase diagrams . in this approach",
    "the ucna is complemented with an appropriate interpolation scheme @xcite . in section",
    "[ result ] we expose and discuss the results obtained within the last approach , comparing the phase diagram with the ones arising from the simplified approach and ( for @xmath11 ) from a perturbative expansion , and the @xmath1-dependence of the order parameter @xmath12 for nonzero @xmath0 with a numerical simulation @xcite . a final discussion of the approach and its results is made in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the model under consideration has been introduced in refs.@xcite : a @xmath13-dimensional extended system of typical linear size @xmath14 is restricted to a hypercubic lattice of @xmath15 points , whereas time is still regarded as a continuous variable .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath16 is given by the set of stochastic variables @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) defined at the sites @xmath19 of this lattice , which obey a system of coupled ordinary stochastic differential equations ( sde ) @xmath20 ( throughout the paper , the stratonovich interpretation for the sde s will be meant ) .",
    "eqs.([eq:1 ] ) are the discrete version of the _ partial _ sde which in the continuum would determine the state of the extended system : we recognize in the first two terms the generalization of langevin s equation for site @xmath21 to the case of multiplicative noise ( @xmath22 is the _ colored _ multiplicative noise acting on site @xmath19 ) . for the specific example analyzed in ref.@xcite , perhaps the simplest one exhibiting the transition under analysis ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) , @xmath23 the last term in eqs.([eq:1 ] ) is nothing but the lattice version of the laplacian @xmath24 of the extended stochastic variable @xmath25 in a reaction - diffusion scheme .",
    "@xmath26 stands for the set of @xmath27 sites which form the immediate neighborhood of the site @xmath19 , and the coupling constant @xmath1 between neighboring lattice sites is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "as previously stated , it is our aim in this work to investigate the effects of the self - correlation time @xmath0 of the multiplicative noise on the model system just described . to that end",
    "we must assume a specific form for the noises @xmath28 : we choose ornstein  uhlenbeck noises , i.e.  gaussian distributed stochastic variables with zero mean and exponentially decaying correlations : @xmath29 they arise as solutions of an _ uncoupled _ set of langevin sde : @xmath30 where the @xmath31 are white noises  namely , gaussian stochastic variables with zero mean and @xmath10-correlated : @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the ornstein  uhlenbeck noise @xmath34 approaches the white - noise limit @xmath35 with correlations @xmath36 , which was the case studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the non - markovian character of the process @xmath37 ( due to the presence of the colored noise @xmath28 ) makes it difficult to study .",
    "however , some approximations have been devised which render a _ markovian _ process that  whereas nicely simplifying the treatment  can still capture some of the essential features of the complete non - markovian one .",
    "the aforementioned ucna is one of them : in fact a very reliable one , because of its ability to reproduce the small and large-@xmath0 limits @xcite . by resorting to interpolation schemes , one can retrieve meaningful results in wider vicinities of these limits @xcite .",
    "as already declared , our approach is a mean - field - like one .",
    "the earlier we make this kind of assumptions in the calculation , the cruder the approximation will turn out to be . in order to find the phase diagram in the presence of colored noise we have made the mean - field approximation at some late stage , so enhancing the precision of the calculation .",
    "however , since this calculation is a tedious one , we shall first expose a simpler approximation which brings out most qualitative results .",
    "we aim in this way to underline the physical origin of the results presented in section iv .",
    "the differences arising from both calculations are pointed out there .",
    "the simpler mean - field approximation follows closely curie ",
    "weiss mean - field approach to magnetism , and consists in replacing the last term in eqs.([eq:1 ] ) @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a _",

    "the ( short - ranged ) interactions are substituted by a time and space - independent `` external '' field whose value _ depends on the state _ of the system . since in this approximation eqs.([eq:1 ] ) get immediately decoupled , there is no use in keeping the subindex @xmath21 and we may refer to the systems in eqs .",

[ a ] as in the white - noise case @xmath115 ( refs.@xcite ) , the ordering phase transition is _ reentrant with respect to @xmath2 _ : for a range of values of @xmath1 that depends on @xmath0 , ordered states can only exist within a window @xmath4 $ ] .",

    "[ b ] for fixed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , ordered states exist _ only within a window _ of values for @xmath1 .",
    "thus the ordering phase transition is _ also reentrant with respect to @xmath1_. for @xmath0 small enough the maximum value of @xmath1 compatible with the ordered phase increases rather steeply with @xmath2 , reaching a maximum around @xmath120 and then decreases gently .",
    "for @xmath121 it becomes evident ( in the ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath2 analyzed ) that the region sustaining the ordered phase is _ closed _ , and shrinks to a point for a value slightly larger than @xmath122 .",
    "[ c ] for fixed values of @xmath118 and @xmath1 larger than its minimum for @xmath115 , the system _ always _ becomes disordered for @xmath0 large enough .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 consistent with order altogether corresponds to @xmath120 and @xmath123 . in other words , ordering is possible _ only _ if the multiplicative noise inducing it has short memory .",
    "[ d ] the fact that the region sustaining the ordered phase finally shrinks to a point means that even for that small region in the @xmath2@xmath1 plane for which order is induced by color , a further increase in @xmath0 destroys it . in other words ,",

    ", i.e.  if after linearizing eq.([eq:50 ] ) : @xmath141 one finds that @xmath142 .",
    "we then see that the trivial ( disordered ) solution @xmath143 is stable only for @xmath144 . for @xmath142 other stable solutions with @xmath145 appear , and the system develops order through a genuine _ phase _ transition . in this case",
    ", @xmath135 can be regarded as the _ order parameter_. in the white noise limit @xmath115 this is known to be the case for sufficiently large values of the coupling @xmath1 and for a window of values for the noise amplitude @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "we discuss now how the stability of the ordered phase is altered by nonzero values of @xmath0 .",
    "if we linearize eq.([eq:50 ] ) using the expression of @xmath147 from eq.([eq:13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath148 if we use instead eq.([eq:45 ] ) , the result can be written exclusively in terms of @xmath149 : @xmath150 with @xmath151 so the instability occurs at @xmath152 .",
    "now , the ratio @xmath153 keeps always below 1 in the positive range , has a minimum of @xmath154 at @xmath155 and a maximum of @xmath156 at @xmath157 .",
    "if we consider e.g.  the conditions in fig.[mdtw5 ] ( namely @xmath126 ) and take @xmath1 large enough so that @xmath158 , one can see that eq.([eq:53 ] ) approximates the left boundary better than eq.([eq:52 ] ) does . in the limit @xmath159 ( but still finite ) eq.([eq:53 ] ) can be approximated to the expression reported in ref.@xcite , namely @xmath160 it is worthwile to stress the fact ( evident from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:52 ] ) , ( [ eq:53 ] ) and ( [ eq:56 ] ) ) that the value of @xmath1 has no effect on the _ location _ of the instability by itself , but only through the combination @xmath149 : according to eq.([eq:56 ] ) the stable phase is the disordered one ( @xmath143 ) for @xmath161 ( since @xmath144 ) and the ordered one ( @xmath162 ) for @xmath163 . in summary , whereas the noise intensity @xmath2 has a destabilizing effect on the disordered phase , as soon as @xmath164 the spatial coupling @xmath1 tends to _ stabilize _ it . for @xmath115 the last effect is not present , being then @xmath118 the condition for ordering @xcite . considering that the effect of even a tiny correlation is enhanced by @xmath1 , we can understand the abrupt change in slope ( from negative to positive ) shown in fig.[mdtw1 ] as soon as @xmath164 .",
    "note the approximately inverse relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for fixed @xmath2 on the upper branches of fig.[mdtw3 ] , even when eq.([eq:51 ] ) is strictly valid for @xmath9 .",
    "this work has focused on the effects of a self - correlation in the multiplicative noise , on the reentrant noise - induced phase transition introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "whereas in a recent letter we have reported the most relevant results @xcite , it has been our purpose in the present work to expose in more detail the techniques and the approximations employed .",
    "we also discuss more thoroughly the results , adding new figures and enriching the contents of others .    through the use of the ucna we recovered a markovian behavior for the system , and through an interpolation scheme similar to the one introduced in ref.@xcite we resolved indeterminacies in the equations describing it .",
    "we stress that the equation resulting from this interpolation scheme are _ exact _ in the limits @xmath115 and @xmath104 .",
    "in addition to the fact that the interpolation scheme has been already applied with success in other works @xcite , the goodness of our approximations for small but nonetheless finite values of @xmath0 has been checked against a standard perturbative expansion @xcite ( adapted for multiplicative noise ) .",
    "it is worth to emphasize the fact that these approximations are , so far , the _ only _ tool available for an analytical treatment of this essentially non - markovian problem .",
    "the main result is that for @xmath164 , the order established as a consequence of the multiplicative character of the noise can be _ destroyed _ by a strong enough spatial coupling .",
    "figure [ mdtw1 ] shows that for given @xmath0 ( 0.03 ) and @xmath2 , the ordered phase can only exist between definite values of @xmath1 . in particular , the upper bound on @xmath1 decreases roughly as @xmath165 for given @xmath2 .",
    "the foregoing result can be understood by recalling that the ordered phase arises as a consequence of the _ collaboration _ between the multiplicative character of the noise and the presence of spatial coupling .",
    "the disordering effect of @xmath1 arises _ only _ when @xmath119 ( the results in ref.@xcite  rightly interpreted in terms of a `` freezing '' of the short - time behavior by a strong enough spatial coupling  are thus consistent with ours ) . as @xmath0 increases , the minimum value of @xmath1 required to stabilize the disordered phase decreases rapidly , and the region in parameter space available to the ordered phase shrinks until it disappears .",
    "the example worked throughout this paper shows vividly the fact that the conceptual inheritance from equilibrium thermodynamics ( though often useful ) is not always applicable .",
    "the equilibrium - thermodynamic lore would induce us to think that as @xmath8 an ordered situation is favored @xcite .",
    "although this is certainly true for the curie - weiss model ( since in that case the deterministic potential is itself bistable and an increase of spatial coupling has the effect of rising the potential barrier between the stable states ) , it is _ not _ in the case we are dealing with , since the deterministic potential is _",
    "monostable_. hence , it is the combined effects of the multiplicative noise _ and _ the spatial coupling that induce the transition .    as a summary , whereas one might say that the value of refs.@xcite is that they tell experimentalists where _ not _ to look for a noise - induced phase transition  namely , in those systems which are prone to exhibit a usual ( zero - dimensional ) noise - induced transition , and for too large noise intensity ",
    "the present work tells moreover that , due to the consideration of the more realistic colored noise source , _ an ordered phase is not to be found for large values of the spatial coupling either_. though the specific choice of the forms for the functions @xmath166 and @xmath167 may appear to some as physically unmotivated , is up to our knowledge the _ simplest _ one exhibiting this phenomenon .",
    "we believe nonetheless that the phenomenon is robust and transcends the specific choice made in this work .",
    "the next obvious step is to consider a finite correlation length in the lattice model , which requires to go beyond the mean field approach .",
    "this problem is being presently studied .",
