    "recent experimental successes in obtaining degeneracy in three - dimensional ultracold fermi vapors @xcite , possibly in combination with microtrap technology @xcite , make it conceivable to realize the quasi one - dimensional neutral fermi gas confined in a trapping potential without the complications due to contacts and impurities .",
    "friedel oscillations are a principal feature of a degenerate fermi gas when translational invariance is broken .",
    "usually , impurities @xcite are the cause .",
    "however , boundaries can also be responsible for friedel oscillations .",
    "the spatial period of friedel oscillations is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi wave number .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced in one spatial dimension because then the susceptibility becomes logarithmically singular at @xmath6 due to perfect nesting .",
    "it is known from the theory of one - dimensional fermions confined between hard walls ( bounded luttinger liquids = bll ) that interactions modify the decay of friedel oscillation away from the boundary @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the friedel oscillations at zero temperature both for the spin - polarized one component system , when s - wave scattering is forbidden , as well as for the two component system .",
    "we apply a recent model of @xmath7 interacting fermionic atoms in one spatial dimension confined in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the model which can be termed `` tomonaga - luttinger model with harmonic confinement '' is analytically solvable in a similar way as the luttinger model ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) using bosonization . the present model is simpler than the luttinger model in that it has only one ( non - chiral ) branch in contrast to the two chiral branches of the latter which result from an artificial split of an otherwise continuous band .",
    "it is found that near the classical boundaries , friedel oscillations decay in a way which differs from the known result for bll @xcite .",
    "it also differs from the result for an infinitely strong pinning impurity @xcite which acts as an invariant hard wall under scaling @xcite .",
    "the calculations become possible because the fermion density in the harmonic trap can be decomposed asymptotically ( i.e. , for @xmath7 ) into a slowly varying part and a part describing the friedel oscillations .",
    "both parts involve a specific phase operator for which a free field theory is available .",
    "friedel oscillations in realistic fermi gas are difficult to observe experimentally at least for two reasons : the integrated total mass in the one - dimensional friedel - oscillations is of the order of one atom ( cf .",
    "e.g.@xcite ) though repulsive interactions increase their weight .",
    "furthermore , temperature effects blur the oscillations unless @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the longitudinal trap frequency @xcite .",
    "provided these exceedingly low temperatures can be realized , we can adopt the argument in @xcite : it is conceivable to use an array of short micro traps each filled with a reduced number of atoms ( thus avoiding instabilities ) .",
    "the oscillations within each trap then add up and lead to a total effect that is enhanced by the number of traps .",
    "using micro fabrication techniques it should be possible to combine 100 traps on one substrate leading to a signal that may become within reach of advanced imaging techniques .",
    "here , we give a short review of the model which is used for the present calculation . more details are given in @xcite .",
    "we start from an effective pair interaction    @xmath10    between one - dimensional spin polarized fermions .",
    "the fermionic creation and destruction operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are taken in the basis of harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "thus the harmonic trap topology is exactly represented .",

    "this is related to approximate momentum conservation during collisions in the trap .    in the next step ,",
    "the linear dispersion of free harmonic oscillator states and the addition of the anomalous vacuum is utilized to bosonize the original fermionic hamiltonian in terms of canonically conjugate bose operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 in accordance with kronig s identity @xcite .",

    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) is the version for a one - component fermi gas , i.e. , for spin polarized fermions .",
    "usually , the remaining `` p - wave '' interaction is small .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated recently that feshbach resonances can make it relevant @xcite .",
    "our simplified interaction hamiltonian is integrable . in the sense of the luttinger liquid phenomenology",
    ", we expect that the boundary exponent for friedel oscillations at zero temperature and for @xmath7 is invariant against details of the interaction .",
    "it is also stressed that the trap potential is exactly incorporated .    in the one - component system",

    ", the validity of our approach could be verified analytically by perturbation theory in the fermionic hilbert space as well as by exact numerical diagonalization of the fermionic problem @xcite .",
    "the existence of only one branch results in restrictions on the values of the interaction coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the one - component case : their contribution is small in comparison to @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "the interaction coefficient @xmath35 can be expressed as    @xmath36      the third contribution on the r.h.s . of equation ( [ 1 ] ) represents a one - particle operator @xmath37 .",
    "it originates from rearranging operators in equation ( [ 0 ] ) to bring backscattering into a bilinear form of density fluctuation operators .",
    "the one - particle operator is neglected in the bll as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it does not alter boundary exponents , but has quantitative effects on other properties .",
    "@xmath37 is exactly taken into account in the present model .",

    "the backscattering phase shift in equation ( [ 30 ] ) is mostly a small correction as is seen by comparing equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , except when the coupling is exceedingly strong .",
    "it is noted that the coupling constant @xmath39 goes to unity and @xmath107 to zero for vanishing interactions .",
    "this answers a question put forward in @xcite : the divergence of the envelope near the boundaries for free friedel oscillations in the harmonic trap has the conjectured boundary exponent @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , i.e. , well inside the trap , one obtains the free friedel oscillations    @xmath110    in accordance with a corresponding result in @xcite , which was obtained by an asymptotic expansion of the exact particle density of non - interacting fermions .    returning to the interacting case and specializing to the region near the classical boundaries , where    @xmath111    the boundary exponent for the decay of friedel oscillations away from these classical turning points is    @xmath112    in contrast , the corresponding result for bll in the case of one component is @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the latter value is also obtained for an infinitely strong pinning impurity which acts as a hard wall @xcite , a case when pinning strength does not scale @xcite .",
    "the present soft boundary thus causes a slower decay for repulsive interactions in comparison to the bll while the situation is reversed for attractive interactions .",
    "we discuss the question how trap parameters influence the value of the boundary exponent and the amplitude of friedel oscillations . in view of @xmath114 and equation ( [ 04 ] ) , the central coupling constant @xmath39 according to equation ( [ 3a ] )",
    "depends on longitudinal trap frequency @xmath9 and particle number @xmath24 ( apart from interaction data ) .",
    "two cases will be considered :    * the trap is made shallower , i.e. , @xmath9 is decreased keeping n constant . in this case , interactions become irrelevant and @xmath39 goes to unity . because the amplitude in equation ( [ 30 ] ) is proportional to @xmath115 the friedel oscillations vanish everywhere inside the huge trap as expected .",
    "however , they still increase towards the boundaries because the trap topology persists for all non - zero @xmath9 . * a kind of thermodynamic limit @xcite is defined by making @xmath116 and @xmath24 large such that the fermi wave number and hence @xmath117 and @xmath118 remain constant .",

    "interestingly , at large but finite @xmath24 the amplitude of friedel oscillations increases faster towards the boundary when interactions are attractive in comparison to the repulsive case .",
    "we develop the corresponding theory for two components , e.g. , two different hyperfine components of the same trapped fermionic atoms .",
    "we assume equal masses and equal trapping frequencies .",

    "this corresponds to spin isotropy in the luttinger model .",
