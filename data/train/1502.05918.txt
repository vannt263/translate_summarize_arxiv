    "mechanism of particle acceleration is still unknown .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration @xcite is the most plausible if strong shock waves exist as in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "we have not yet well constrained model parameters , namely magnetic field strength and degree of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , although there are observational claims of turbulent , amplified field in young snrs @xcite .",
    "these are important to estimate maximum attainable energy of both electrons and nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that cutoff shape of electron spectrum around the maximum energy @xmath5 may provide us important information on the cosmic - ray acceleration at young snrs .",
    "they related the cutoff shape parameter @xmath0 , which is defined by @xmath6 $ ] , to the energy dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient @xmath1 ( that is , @xmath7 ) in each case where the maximum electron energy is determined by snr age , synchrotron cooling and escape from the shock .",
    "they found that if the power - law index of the electron spectrum is independently determined by other observations , then the cutoff shape parameter can be constrained by near future hard x - ray observations such as nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) @xcite and astro - h @xcite and/or cta @xcite .",
    "these x - ray and gamma - ray observations will be important for the estimate of @xmath1 as well as @xmath5 and the magnetic field strength .",
    "in analysis of @xcite , they assumed relations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 in the case of age - limited , cooling - limited and escape - limited acceleration , respectively .",
    "the formula @xmath8 in the age - limited case has been based on numerical simulation @xcite , while the others are obtained analytically on the assumption of stationary state , and they are not yet confirmed numerically . in this paper",
    ", we study the cutoff shape of the electron spectrum by numerically solving the transport equation describing diffusive shock acceleration , and study whether the above relations are right or not .",
    "we use a numerical method for solving cosmic - ray transport equation ( so - called , diffusion - convection equation ) , which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the equivalence between the fokker - planck equation and the it stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies have followed for various situations @xcite . it should be noted that the sde method has an advantage if the transport equation has to be solved in multi - dimensions . in practice ,",
    "the importance of upstream inhomogeneity for understanding of cosmic - ray acceleration at supernova remnants has been pointed out by various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case ,",
    "it is clear to consider the particle acceleration in three dimensions .",
    "the simple - minded application of the sde method has problems in actual numerical integration .",
    "first , @xmath10-functions appear in sde if we apply it to the shock front , where the background fluid velocity as well as the diffusion coefficient have a sudden jump . in order to avoid this ,",
    "the shock structure is artificially smoothed @xcite . however , even in this case , the time step has to be small enough for the simulated particles not to miss the sharp gradient at the shock front , which significantly slows down the simulation .",
    "furthermore , in actual simulation time , approximation of the smooth shock transition causes incorrect particle spectrum .",
    "this difficulty was solved by @xcite who used the skew brownian motion @xcite which can be solved by a scaling method that eliminated the @xmath10-functions in the sde .",
    "other numerical schemes to resolve this problem have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "second problem is that a large dynamic range in particle momentum causes low statistical accuracy at large momenta .",
    "this difficulty was also resolved by employing a particle splitting technique @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first attempt to perform simulations of electron acceleration incorporating _ both _ methods of @xcite and particle splitting . owing to newly developed code , simulated spectra",
    "have cutoff shape accurate enough to be compared with analytical formulae . as a first step , we focus on the cases of one - dimensional plane shock .",
    "extended studies for more complicated cases such as time dependent free escape boundary , nonuniform magnetic fields , and/or multi - dimensional systems ( including spherical shock geometry ) are simple but remained as future works .",
    "in this paper , we consider one - dimensional system , that is , all quantities depend on the spatial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "the diffusion - convection equation with energy - loss process is given by @xmath12=0~~ , \\label{eq : dc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the distribution function for electrons , and @xmath14 is the electron momentum .",
    "functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are background velocity field and the spatial diffusion coefficient of the electrons , respectively . in this paper , we consider the synchrotron cooling .",
    "then , the loss term becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the electrons lorentz factor , and @xmath20 is the magnetic field .",
    "physical constants , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are thomson cross section , mass of electron and velocity of light , respectively .    introducing new quantities ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 equation  ( [ eq : dc ] ) becomes the fokker - planck form , @xmath26 - \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(kf ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left [ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d v}{d x}+\\beta_{syn}\\gamma\\right)f\\right]=0 \\label{eq : fp}~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is equivalent to the following sdes of the it form : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a wiener process given by the gaussian distribution : @xmath30 numerical simulation by sdes is much faster than that with the usual monte carlo method and is much easier than solving the original fokker - planck equation , because the sdes are ordinary differential equations .",
    "the application of the sdes , equations  ( [ eq : sde1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) , for the study of electron acceleration at the shock is not simple , because the velocity field @xmath15 has a sudden jump at the shock front , so that @xmath31 in equation  ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) contains @xmath10-function .",
    "similarly , if the diffusion coefficient also behaves discontinuously at the shock front , then @xmath32 in equation  ( [ eq : sde1 ] ) also contains the @xmath10-function .",
    "we take the comoving frame with the shock which is located at @xmath33 and we define @xmath34 as upstream region .",
    "following @xcite , we decompose the velocity field @xmath35 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 into two parts : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are continuous for arbitrary @xmath11 ( including @xmath33 ) .",
    "we scale the @xmath11 coordinate according to its sign in the following way @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 then , sdes ( [ eq : sde1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath46~~ , \\label{eq : sde3}\\ ] ] @xmath47 ~~. \\label{eq : sde4}\\ ] ] derivation of equations  ( [ eq : sde3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sde4 ] ) are the same way as of @xcite .",
    "these equations do not contain @xmath10-functions and can be integrated directly .",
    "once @xmath48 is obtained , the position of electrons @xmath49 can be obtained by @xmath50 in order to see the effect of diffusion , the spatial step size of diffusion in one time step @xmath51 must be larger than that of convection , that is @xmath52 . hence we derive the requirement of the time step as @xmath53        a particle splitting is necessary to achieve a wide momentum range of accelerated electrons .",
    "following @xcite , we set splitting surfaces @xmath76 in momentum space ( @xmath77 ) with an equal spacing in logarithmic scale : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "each time an accelerated particle hits the surface @xmath76 , the particle is split into @xmath81 particles with the same energy and spatial position which particles have attained .",
    "the statistical weight which is needed to calculate the final spectrum of the particles is decreased by a factor of @xmath81 in each splitting .",
    "in the following , we consider electron acceleration at stationary plane parallel shock , that is , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 where constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 are upstream and downstream velocities , respectively",
    ". compression ratio @xmath87 is fixed to be 4 throughout the paper .",
    "we also assume that the diffusion coefficient is uniform both in upstream and downstream regions , that is , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 where upstream and downstream coefficients , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , depend on electron momentum . in this paper , we assume @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath95 g .",
    "we set a free escape boundary at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) in the upstream region .",
    "once a particle goes beyond the boundary , it never comes back to the acceleration site .",
    "this fact becomes significant when the particle s penetration depth in the upstream region , @xmath98 , is comparable to @xmath99 . on the other hand , when @xmath99 is sufficiently large ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) , the particle escape does not occur .",
    "the start and end times of electron acceleration are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . during this period ,",
    "electrons are injected with a momentum @xmath103 at the shock front @xmath33 continuously at a constant rate .",
    "taking an ensemble average over a number of realizations of sdes , ( [ eq : sde3 ] ) , ( [ eq : sde4 ] ) and ( [ eq : sinv ] ) , we obtain the momentum spectrum of the whole region ( including both upstream and downstream regions as well as the shock front ) at @xmath104 . in the following ,",
    "we consider the case @xmath105 .",
    "then , @xmath106 increases with @xmath14 . hence , if the injection momentum @xmath103 is taken so as to @xmath107 , the condition for time step , equation  ( [ eq : timestep ] ) , is always satisfied .",
    "it can be seen from table  2 that @xmath103 satisfies this requirement .",
    "we perform simulations for various parameter sets .",
    "adopted parameters are summarized in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the cutoff shape of electron spectrum depends on how the maximum momentum of electrons is determined . in the next section ,",
    "we consider three cases , age - limited , cooling - limited , and escape - limited cases , in order to decide the maximum attainable electron momentum due to the diffusive shock acceleration ."
