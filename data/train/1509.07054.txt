    "epidemic like spreading processes are paradigmatic , as they can describe not only the temporal unfolding and evolution of diseases , but also of ideas , information and rumors in fields as diverse as biological , information and social sciences @xcite .",
    "due to their fundamental nature and simplicity , two particular models have received special attention by the scientific community , the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) . in both models ,",
    "an infected individual spreads the disease to its neighbors at a given ( spreading ) rate and infected individuals recovers at some other rate .",
    "the difference between both scenarios is that in the sis case , once recovered , infected individuals are considered to be able to catch the disease again , and therefore , they go back to the susceptible state . on the contrary , in the sir model ,",
    "recovered individuals are supposed to acquire permanent immunity -hence why they are also referred to as removed- and they do not play any active role in the spreading process anymore .",
    "there are many other variations of these two models , including more realistic and intricate compartmental models  @xcite , however , these two schemes are sufficient to capture the main phenomenology of disease dynamics -and many other contagion like processes- , including the onset of epidemics , while remaining simple .    originally , the modeling of diseases was confined to homogeneous systems , where any pair of individuals have the same probability of being in contact  @xcite . as shown since early 2000 s , this is not in general a realistic assumption , and therefore , previous results were re - examined considering non - trivial patterns among individuals , such as power law degree distributions  @xcite . in  @xcite , the authors presented the heterogeneous mean - field approach ( hmf ) , showing that the epidemic threshold tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit on scale - free networks .",
    "this observation that the network structure radically influences basic but fundamental pillars of epidemiology -like the epidemic threshold and immunization protocols- changed completely our previous understanding of how disease outbreaks should be modeled , placing the focus of attention not only into new ways to model disease dynamics , but also to the incorporation of real contact patterns into the dynamical settings  @xcite .    since then , many computational and theoretical frameworks have been proposed , which undoubtedly had made the modeling of disease contagion an active area of research and have provided new phenomenological insights to , and accurate methods for the study of real outbreaks .",
    "for instance , instead of the hmf approach , one can adopt the quenched mean field ( qmf ) method , where an specific network is fixed and the dynamics is modeled in terms of nodal probabilities  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with the latter approach show that the epidemic threshold depends on the inverse of the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix  @xcite -a similar result was also obtained using a discrete markov chain approach  @xcite .",
    "other scenarios explored recently include the case of temporal networks  @xcite , competing and interacting diseases  @xcite as well as the inclusion of human behavioral responses  @xcite .    however , the vast majority of the works so far deal with single - layered networks , despite the fact that many real systems exhibits a large degree of interconnectivity and hence should be modeled as layers of coupled networks .",
    "such systems represent multimodal , different categorical or temporal interactions , as for instance social relations , the ecosystem formed by different online social networks or modern transportation systems @xcite . with this in mind , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors showed that disregarding the multilayer structure can lead to misleading conclusions , missing fundamental aspects of the critical dynamics of spreading like processes .",
    "such findings reinforce the importance of a more detailed investigation of contagion processes on multilayer networks . in this work , we develop a theoretical and computational framework for the analysis of disease spreading , generalizing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to multilayer networks . in doing so",
    ", we provide a continuous counterpart to the model presented in @xcite in terms of the tensorial notation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the methodology introduce here allows for several new results : first , we are able to write down in a compact form the equations describing the disease dynamics in a multilayer system .",
    "secondly , we derive the corresponding epidemic thresholds for the sis and sir case as well as establish bounds for the prevalence of the disease in the sis scenario .",
    "we also identify previously unnoticed multiple transitions and disease localization , which are traced back to the very topological nature of the system and described in terms of the eigenvalue spectra of the supra - contact tensor and the localization of eigenstates .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we first formally define a multilayer network , introducing the tensorial notation .",
    "next we derive the equations describing the dynamics of the disease for the sis scheme , calculating the upper and lower bounds for the prevalence of the disease in the steady state , followed by the analytical expression for the epidemic threshold -which is also derived for the sir model .",
    "furthermore , we use the results in  @xcite to define some constraints on the critical point . in addition , we explore the notion of localization of eigenstates , formerly applied on epidemic spreading in  @xcite , in order to inspect multiple phase transitions . finally , we also present results from extensive numerical simulations considering multiplex networks with scale - free and scale - rich structures , computing their respective epidemic thresholds",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "we use here the tensorial representation , formerly presented in  @xcite .",
    "we also adopt the einstein summation convention , in order to have more compact equations : if two indices are repeated , where one is a superscript and the other a subscript , then such operation implies a summation . aside from that , the result is a tensor whose rank lowers by 2 .",
    "for instance , @xmath0 . in our notation",
    "we use greek letters to indicate the components of a tensor .",
    "in addition , we use tilde ( @xmath1 ) to denote the components related to the layers , with dimension @xmath2 , while the components without tilde have dimension @xmath3 and are related to the nodes .    a multilayer network is represented as the fourth - order adjacency tensor @xmath4  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate the tensor in its respective canonical basis .",
    "observe that we can extract one layer by projecting the tensor @xmath8 to the canonical tensor @xmath9 .",
    "formally , from  @xcite we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the selected layer and @xmath12 is the adjacency matrix ( rank-2 tensor ) .",
    "moreover , aiming at having more compact and clear equations we define the all - one tensors @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here , we restrict our analysis to multilayer networks with a diagonal coupling  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "each node can have at most one counterpart on the other layers .",
    "in addition , for simplicity , we focus on unweighted and undirected connected networks , in which there is a path from each node to all other nodes .    besides the adjacency tensor , the network of layers @xcite also characterizes the topology of the system . in this reduced network representation ,",
    "each node represents one layer and the edges between them codify the number of edges connecting those two layers .",
    "formally we have , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "note that such a network presents self - loops , which are weighted by the number of edges on the layer .",
    "additionally , since we assume that the layers have the same number of nodes , the edges of the network of layers have weights equal to the number of nodes @xmath3 .",
    "another important reduction of the multilayer network is the so - called projection  @xcite .",
    "such network aggregates all the information into one layer , including self - loops that stand for the number of layers in which a node appears .",
    "mathematically , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "next , we define the sis disease dynamics , which is modeled as follows .",
    "we associate a poisson process to each of the elementary dynamical transitions : intra and inter layer spreading and the recovery from the infected state .",
    "the first two processes are associated to the edges of the graph and are characterized by the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the latter transition is modeled in the node , also via a poisson process with parameter @xmath21 . using the tensorial notation defined above",
    ", the equations describing the systems dynamics read as @xmath22 where the supra contact tensor is defined as @xmath23 which encodes the contacts .",
    "it has a similar role as the matrix @xmath24 in  @xcite .",
    "important enough , note that we have implicitly assumed that the random variables @xmath25 are independent .",
    "formally , if the state variable @xmath26 is such that @xmath27 when the node @xmath28 on layer @xmath29 is an spreader and @xmath30 otherwise , then @xmath31 = x_{\\beta \\tilde{\\delta}}$ ] . in this way , the independence of random variables implies that @xmath32 = p[s_{\\beta \\tilde{\\delta } } = 1 ] p[s_{\\alpha \\tilde{\\gamma } } = 1 ] = x_{\\beta \\tilde{\\delta } } x_{{\\alpha \\tilde{\\gamma}}}$ ] .",
    "cator and van mieghem  @xcite proved rigorously that the states of any two nodes in the sis model are non - negatively correlated for all finite graphs .",
    "this result can be easily extended to our case , since we are considering constant rates and markovian processes . due to the positive contribution of the infected nodes we have @xmath33 \\geq p[s_{\\beta \\tilde{\\delta } }",
    "= 1]$ ] , implying that the model is always overestimated .",
    "a similar conclusion was also obtained in  @xcite for the monolayer model .",
    "moreover , we define the macro - state variable as @xmath34 which is the average of the individual probabilities .",
    "note that the steady state is not an absorbing state in the markov sense , since there is a set of possible states where the system remains trapped and there is a stochastic variation over time .",
    "moreover , there are many different configurations for which the fraction of infected nodes is the same .",
    "more formally , there is a set of states above the threshold which have finite probability larger than zero , configuring a meta - state .",
    "the only absorbing state of this set of equations is thus the disease - free state , since when it is reached the ( micro and macro ) dynamics stops .",
    "let us first obtain some bounds for the epidemic incidence considering the steady state , where @xmath35 .",
    "for a monolayer system those bounds were calculated in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a multilayer network without self loops and denote the steady state of each node as @xmath36 .",
    "then , imposing @xmath35 to eq .",
    "[ eq : sis_tensor ] we have @xmath37 the value of @xmath36 is then obtained by iterating the above equation from an initial value , until convergence .",
    "upper and lower bounds can be obtained by considering only the first iteration of eq .",
    "[ eq : steady ] . for the upper",
    "bound we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 as can be noticed , there are two different contributions to the upper bound coming from intra and inter - layers connectivity .",
    "both of them tend to increase the probability of a node being infected .",
    "furthermore , the higher is the degree , the higher is this upper bound . on the other hand , for the lower bound ,",
    "let us denote @xmath40 . then , substituting @xmath41 in eq .",

    "the bounds approach each other and all nodes tend to be infected .",
    "phenomenologically , the latter parameter configuration models the limiting case of a si - like scenario , where @xmath49 . in such a dynamical process all individuals are infected in the steady state .      as we will show below , the epidemic threshold is closely related to the leading eigenvalues of the supra - contact tensor . here",
    "we describe the eigenvalue problem in general , and then in the following section we show the connection with the epidemic threshold .",
    "the eigenvalue problem can be generalized to the case of a rank-4 tensor leading to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an eigenvalue and @xmath52 is the corresponding eigentensor .",
    "in addition , we are assuming that the eigentensors form an orthonormal basis .",
    "importantly , the supra - contact matrix , @xmath24 , in  @xcite can be understood as a flattened version of the tensor @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , all the results for @xmath24 also apply to the tensor @xmath54 . as argued in  @xcite , that supra - adjacency matrix corresponds to unique unfolding of the fourth - order tensor @xmath2 yielding square matrices .",
    "following this unique mapping we have the correspondence of the eigensystems . here",
    ", we consider that the eigenvalues are ordered as @xmath55 and denote the individual layer eigenvalues as @xmath56 .      assuming @xmath57 and that the dynamics has reached the steady state , @xmath35 , we can write eq .  [ eq : sis_tensor ] as @xmath58 expanding the left - hand term following the geometrical series , where @xmath59 for @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61    in addition , similarly to  @xcite , suppose @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is an arbitrary small constant and @xmath64 . substituting in eq .",
    "[ eq : sis_serie ] and dividing by @xmath63 we have @xmath65 considering a sufficiently small @xmath66 this expression reduces to the eigentensor equation @xmath67 leading to the critical point @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath54 , which is the same as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath24 in  @xcite . moreover , if @xmath70 , the threshold of the system is dominated by the individual layer behavior and the epidemic threshold is approximated to that of a sis model on monolayers , when considering the union of @xmath2 disjoint networks .",
    "consequently , the epidemic threshold is determined by the largest eigenvalue , considering all layers .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in  @xcite using perturbation theory on the supra - contact matrix .      aside from the sis epidemic model",
    ", we can also consider the sir model .",
    "the recovered and susceptible states are denoted here as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . using a similar notation as in the latter section and associating poisson processes to nodes and edges",
    ", we have the dynamical set of equations @xmath73 note that the poisson processes on the nodes model the recovering , whereas on the edges , model the spreading .",
    "since there is no dynamic steady state in the sir model , the epidemic threshold has a different interpretation from that of the sis model . above the threshold",
    "the total number of recovered individuals reaches a finite fraction of the population , when the dynamic starts with a small fraction of infected individuals .",
    "formally , the initial condition are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a small constant , @xmath78 . neglecting higher order terms , we have @xmath79 after a proper factorization , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a tensor analogous to the identity matrix , whose elements are one if the indices are the same .",
    "the epidemic threshold is as in eq .",
    "[ eq : threshold ] , which is the critical value for both sir and sis dynamics .",
    "since the epidemic dynamics is expressed as a function of the supra adjacency tensor @xmath82 , studying the spectral properties of the latter could give further insights about the whole process , especially the critical point .",
    "in this section , we generalize the spectral results of interlacing , obtained in  @xcite , to the tensorial description adopted here .",
    "in addition , we also make use of the inverse participation ratio , @xmath83 , as a measurement of eigenvalue localization .",
    "such ratio was firstly applied to epidemic spreading in  @xcite , here we extend such metric to the tensorial formalism .",
    ".structure and spectra of the normalized network of layers @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalues assumes that the average degree of each layer , @xmath85 , is the same , i.e. @xmath86 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : spec_net_net ]    invoking the unique mapping and considering the results of  @xcite , we can use the interlacing properties to relate the spectra of the multilayer network with the spectra of the network of layers .",
    "first of all , we define the normalized network of layers in terms of the supra contact tensor as @xmath87 where we are implicitly assuming a multilayer network in which the layers have the same number of nodes and a dependency on the spreading rates ( the demonstration that such tensor is an unfolding of the matrix exposed in  @xcite is shown on appendix a ) . additionally , let s denote by @xmath88 the ordered eigenvalues of @xmath84 .",
    "following  @xcite , the interlacing properties imply @xmath89 for @xmath90 . as examples ,",
    "table  [ tab : spec_net_net ] shows the spectrum of three simple networks of layers that can be computed analytically : a line with two and three nodes and a triangle .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] shows an schematic illustration of those 3 multilayer networks .",
    "furthermore , using similar arguments we can also obtain results for the normalized projection , formally given as @xmath91 whose ordered eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath92 , also interlace with the supra contact tensor satisfying @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "finally , the adjacency tensor of an extracted layer also interlaces , yielding to @xmath95 for @xmath94 .",
    "these results show that the eigenvalue of the multilayer adjacency tensor is always larger than or equal to all of the eigenvalues of the individual isolated layers as well as the network of layers .",
    "the interlacing properties presented here imply some constraints to the epidemic threshold .",
    "as advanced in  @xcite , let @xmath96 be the @xmath97-th eigenvalue of the tensor @xmath98 and consider that the set of eigenvalues is ordered as before . moreover , for simplicity , we suppress the argument when referring to the supra - contact matrix .",
    "first of all , assuming a fixed ratio of spreading rates , we observe that the eigenvalue of the multilayer follows @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the critical point for the single layer @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the critical point of the network of layers . finally , considering the projection @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the critical point of the normalized projection .",
    "thus , the spreading process on the whole system is at least as efficient as it is on the layers and on the network of layers .",
    "note that efficiency is understood here in terms of the position of the critical point , and not regarding the fraction of infected individuals in the steady state .",
    "next , we investigate using the analysis of section  [ sec : eig_sec ] the behavior of the system near the phase transition and whether the phenomenon of disease localization shows up .",
    "these two issues were explored for monoplex networks in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively , but have not been addressed for the case of multilayer systems .",
    "the nodal probabilities can be written as a linear combination of the eigenbasis of @xmath54 as @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the projections of @xmath25 on the eigentensors @xmath108 .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , substituting such expression on the middle term of eq .",
    "[ eq : steady ] we obtain @xmath109    considering only the contributions of the first eigenvalue and eigentensor , for @xmath110 , the first order approximation of the macro state parameter is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , which yields @xmath113 such expression is exact if there is a gap between the first two eigenvalues , as exposed in  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "considering two eigentensors we have @xmath114 . besides",
    ", following a similar approach as in  @xcite we can use the inverse participation ratio : @xmath115 in the limit of @xmath116 , if @xmath83 is of order @xmath117 the eigentensor is localized and the components of @xmath52 are of order @xmath117 only for a few nodes . on the other hand , if @xmath118 then this state is delocalized and the components of @xmath119 .",
    "in order to compare with analytical results , we have performed extensive numerical simulations using a monte carlo method from  @xcite adapted to the case of multilayer networks , which we describe in what follows . at each time",
    "step the time is incremented by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the number of infected nodes , and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the number of intra - layer and inter - layer edges emanating from them , respectively . with probability @xmath124 ,",
    "one randomly chosen infected individual becomes susceptible . on the other hand , with probability @xmath125 ,",
    "one infected individual , chosen with a probability proportional to its intra - layer degree , spreads the disease to an edge chosen uniformly random .",
    "finally , with probability @xmath126 one infected individual , chosen with a probability proportional to its inter - layer degree , propagates the disease to an edge chosen uniformly .",
    "if an edge between two infected individuals is selected during the spreading , nothing happens , only time is incremented .",
    "the process is iterated following this set of rules , simulating the continuous process described by the sis scenario .",
    "the quasi - stationary state ( qs ) method  @xcite restricts the dynamics to non - absorbing states .",
    "every time the process tries to visit an absorbing state , it is substituted by an active configuration previously visited and is stored on a list with @xmath127 configurations , constantly updated . with a probability @xmath128 a random configuration on such a list is replaced by the actual configuration . in order to extract meaningful statistics from the quasi - static distribution , denoted by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of infected individuals , the system must be on the stationary state and a large number of samples must be extracted . in this way we let the simulations run during a relaxation time @xmath131 and extract the distribution @xmath129 during a sampling time @xmath132 .",
    "the threshold can be estimated using the modified susceptibility  @xcite , given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the quasi - stationary distribution @xmath129 .",
    "as argued in  @xcite the susceptibility presents a peak at the phase transition on finite systems . such measure is the coefficient of variation of the temporal distribution of states over time on the steady state .",
    "note that the magnitude of the susceptibility @xmath135 is not of primary interest to us , but rather the position of its maximum value with respect to @xmath136 , since it will coincide with the critical threshold for sufficiently large systems .",
    "in addition , after obtaining the curves of @xmath137 by the qs method , we also apply a moving average filter in order to get rid of the noise .",
    "such an approach improves the visual quality of the plots and does not interfere on the results , since the epidemic spreading presents only second order ( i.e. continuous ) phase transitions , and the order of magnitude of the noise is smaller than those of the peaks corresponding to the phase transitions .",
    "the parameters used in the qs method are @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath131 varies from @xmath140 to @xmath141 in order to obtain a smoother curve .",
    "the qs method demands a large sample size , since it is estimating the variance of a distribution .",
    "moreover , we construct the @xmath137 curves in steps of @xmath142 and the moving average window has 5 points .",
    "in this section we numerically study 2-layer multiplex systems .",
    "first , we focus on the phase diagram of the spreading process as a function of the inter and intra layer spreading rates for both , sis and sir scenarios .",
    "next , we analyze the spectral properties of such systems , comparing with results of section  [ sec : spectra ] . finally , we perform monte carlo simulations that show the existence of multiple phase transitions on multiplex networks . the latter results are analyzed in terms of the spectral properties of @xmath82 .",
    "results shown in this section are the numerical solutions of the ode systems  [ eq : sis_tensor ] and  [ eq : sir_tensor ] using a runge - kutta ( 4,5 ) algorithm  @xcite .",

    "moreover , we stress that the abrupt change observed for @xmath83 is always present in such scenarios , but it could be either from the lower to the higher values or vice versa depending on the structure of the layers .       as a function of the ratio @xmath153 for a multiplex with two layers with the same degree distribution ( different random realizations of the configuration model ) and connected to its counterpart on the other layer . on the top panel we present the inverse participation ratio ( @xmath83 ) of the two larger eigenvalues and the individual layer contributions , while on bottom panel we show the leading eigenvalues . every curve is composed by @xmath155 log spaced points , in order to have enough resolution . ]    in addition to the identical case , we have also considered a multiplex network composed by two layers with the same degree distribution ( i.e. the same degree sequence ) , with @xmath159 , but different random realizations of the configuration model .",
    "furthermore , the inter - edges follow the same rule as before , connecting nodes with their counterparts on the other layer assuring that every node has the same intra - degree on all layers .",
    "each layer of the multiplex network is composed by @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "since each layer is a different realization of the configuration model , both present a slightly different leading eigenvalue , the first @xmath163 and the second @xmath164 .",

    "such analysis is meaningless on the identical case , since the contribution is the same .",
    "as shown in the figure , we observe that for small values of @xmath153 , in regard to the first eigenvalue , the system is localized on the first layer and delocalized on the second . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture changes when we focus on the second eigenvalue , as it is localized on the second layer , but delocalized on the first . for larger values of @xmath153",

    "analogously to the identical case , there is a change on @xmath165 , which seems to be related to the changes on @xmath166 , as one can see on the bottom panel and in the inset .",

    "although the two cases evaluated previously present interesting spectral behaviors , both represent scenarios in which the eigenvalues of each layer are similar , if not the same .",
    "next , we study a multiplex network made up of two scale - free networks with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "such a configuration imposes a distance between the leading eigenvalues of each layer , and therefore we expect a completely different behavior with respect to the previous setups .",

    "figure  [ fig : localization_2 ] shows the spectral properties of the tensor @xmath82 as a function of the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "in contrast to the identical and similar cases , figures  [ fig : localization_identical ] and  [ fig : localization_similar ] , where some eigenvalues increase while others decrease , here all the observed eigenvalues always increase .",
    "moreover , we do not observe any crossing or near - crossing behavior .",
    "regarding @xmath83 , the same pattern as for the similar case is found : for small values of @xmath153 and considering the first eigenvalue , the system appears localized on the first layer and delocalized on the second , while for @xmath165 , it is the contrary . for larger values of @xmath153 , both layers contribute equally to the @xmath83 .",
    "the only difference that we observe for the current setup with respect to the two similar networks ( see figure  [ fig : localization_similar ] ) , is that now no drastic change on the inverse participation ratio is found , as expected , since there is no near - crossing .    from figure",
    "[ fig : localization_2 ] we can also extract an important numerical result regarding the perturbation theory . we observed that in our case , considering a two spaced - individual layer eigenvalues problem , the leading eigenvalue can be approximated by the largest leading eigenvalue of the individual layers for @xmath173 , such approximation becomes poorer as @xmath153 increases , but it can be acceptable up to @xmath174 , within a certain error . apart from that ,",
    "note that both eigenvalues tend to increase , while its difference tends to decrease .",
    ", as a function of the spreading rate @xmath19 for different ratios of inter and intra - layer spreading ratings , @xmath153 for a fixed value of @xmath175 over a 2-layer multiplex system , where each layer have @xmath176 , the first with @xmath167 , while the second @xmath168 .",

    "they studied the behavior of a sis model on networks with @xmath178 .",
    "here we show that such phenomena also appear , in a natural way , on multilayer networks .",
    "motivated by the findings reported in the latter sections , especially by the presence of a second transition as observed in figures  [ fig : phase ] and  [ fig : phaselayer ] , we have performed extensive monte carlo simulations using the qs - method with the aim of determining as accurately as possible the points at which the phase transition takes place for a 2-layer multiplex network .",
    "here we use the mutiplex built up in section  [ sec : different_l ] , since the leading eigenvalues of each layer are spaced . note that our numerical simulations are performed on a fixed network , since we follow the quenched formalism .",
    "figure  [ fig : qs ] shows that for low values of the ratio @xmath153 , both networks are weakly coupled and the system exhibits two well - defined critical points ( vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "however , as this ratio increases the peak signaling the presence of the second critical point decreases and eventually vanishes . in our simulations",
    ", we have observed that up to @xmath179 , the second peak , although less defined , is still present . beyond the latter point , only one peak remains .",
    "as @xmath153 further increases , the position of the remaining critical point remains the same , and the peak is even more well defined .",
    "interestingly enough , if the ratio @xmath153 continues to increase -in our numerics beyond @xmath180- the critical point shift to the left to values that are even smaller than the smallest critical point of the individual layers .",
    "it is worth highlighting that a similar qualitative behavior can be seen in the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ( a ) , where one can also observe a second phase transition -note the change in the slope of @xmath149 near the leading eigenvalue of the second layer .",
    "this transition also vanishes as the intra - layer spreading increases .",
    "since the tensor @xmath82 plays a major role on the spreading process , our spectral results can help understand the observed critical dynamics . in epidemiological terms -or in general for contagion processes-",
    ", the localization of the disease on a certain layer means that most of the spreading is expected to take place on the nodes of that layer .",
    "moreover , in addition to the localization on the layers , one can also have localization effects on specific nodes or groups of nodes for instance .    in order to analytically explain this phenomenon",
    ", we evaluate @xmath83 for the two leading eigenvalues , as this measure indicates the localization of an eigenstate , see section  [ sec : different_l ] ( results shown in figure  [ fig : localization_2 ] ) . comparing the susceptibility and @xmath83 , we observe that @xmath165 starts decaying for @xmath179 and crosses the value @xmath181 , at which the associated eigenvector delocalizes , for @xmath182 , that compares well with the point at which the second peak in the susceptibility decays and finally disappears .",
    "moreover , @xmath183 decays from @xmath184 , which coincides with the range where the remaining maximum in the susceptibility reaches higher values and is better defined .",
    "more interestingly , note that @xmath183 is mainly composed by the contributions of the first layer for a lower spreading ratio , suggesting that it is localized on such layer .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that the @xmath83 is a proper measure to detect and predict the observed two phase transitions in the system s behavior and potentially for @xmath2-phase transitions , as we will show in the next section .",
    "following the main ideas of the last sections , we next explore what happens for multilayers networks with are made by more of two layers .",
    "specifically , we have carried out numerical simulations for a 3-layer system .",
    "we generate multiplex networks using three scale - free networks , with @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , with @xmath169 and @xmath170 nodes on each layer .",
    "note that we consider three layers with spaced individual leading eigenvalues in order to investigate whether multiple phase transitions is a generic phenomenon of multilayer systems .",
    "note that we have two possible topologies for the network of layers : ( i ) a line graph and ( ii ) a triangle ( which is a node - aligned multiplex ) . in its turn , the first can be arranged in three possible configurations by changing the central layer .",
    "that is , we have four possible systems .",
    "we perform our numerical simulations as in the last section .",
    "first , we evaluate the spectrum of @xmath82 for all the networks described . in the following ,",
    "we apply the localization theory in order to get insights on the dynamical behavior , similarly to section  [ sec : multiple_2mux ] .           for the multiplex configuration as a function of of the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "it is noteworthy that such plot is visually equivalent for all the layer topologies composed by 3 layers .",
    "the dashed lines represents the individual layer leading eigenvalues . ]        since the epidemic process is described through the supra adjacency tensor @xmath82 , its spectral properties give us some insights about the whole process , especially about the critical properties of the systems under analysis .",
    "moreover , as the structure of the network of layers is not trivial anymore , we shall find important differences regarding the spectra of such tensors for the different topologies of the network of layers .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum_3layer ] shows the spectrum of the four configurations of networks when varying the ratio @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "observe that we do not show the ratio @xmath161 since it is just the union of the individual layers spectrum .",
    "for @xmath190 , the four configurations are very similar , especially the line graphs . in such case",
    ", the inter - layer edges are treated in the same way as the intra - layer ones . in other words , they are ignored and the network can be interpreted as a monoplex network . as the spreading ratio increases the spectrum tends to be clustered near the values of the eigenvalues of the network of layers .",
    "such spectra was analytically calculated in section  [ sec : teo ] and shown in table  [ tab : spec_net_net ] .",
    "regarding the triangle configuration , the clustering of the spectrum as @xmath153 increases is even clear .",
    "triangles present the lowest eigenvalue with multiplicity two . on the extreme case of @xmath191 , see figure  [ fig : spectrum_3layer ] , we have @xmath192 of the values near the left extreme value while @xmath193 is near the leading eigenvalue .",
    "on the other hand , for the line configurations , the frequencies of the eigenvalues distribution is related to the position of the central layer . however , on the limiting cases such differences are reduced .",
    "this pattern is naturally related to the increase of the spreading ratio : when @xmath153 increases , so does the role of the inter - layer edges relative to the intra - layer ones .",
    "consequently , the structure of the network of layers imposes itself more strongly on the eigenvalues of the entire interconnected structure .",
    "this comes as a consequence of the interlacing theorems shown in section  [ sec : eig_sec ] .",
    "our findings can be related to the structural transition shown in  @xcite , where the authors evaluated the supra - laplacian matrix as a function of the inter - layer weights .",
    "their main result is an abrupt structural transition from a decoupled regime , where the layers seem to be independent , to a coupled regime where the layers behave as one single system . here",
    ", we are interested in the supra - adjacency tensor , however , we found a similar phenomenological behavior and a structural change of the system as a function of the inter - layer weights , which in our case are determined by a dynamical process .",
    "apart from the eigenvalues distribution , it is also important to analyze the eigentensors .",
    "such an analysis is performed in terms of the inverse participation ratio , similarly to what we did for the 2-layer multiplex case .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigs ] shows the 10th larger eigenvalues of the 3-layer multiplex case .",
    "the dashed lines represent the leading eigenvalue of each layer .",
    "note that the leading eigenvalue of the layer with @xmath194 is the 7th larger on the network spectrum when @xmath161 .",
    "we observe that there is no crossings on the observed eigenvalues , which is an expected result , since the layers have different structures .",
    "furthermore , it is important to remark that all networks of layers evaluated also show similar qualitative behaviors .",
    "the topology of the network of layers does not lead to qualitative differences on the dependence of @xmath195 on @xmath153 for the first ten eigenvalues .",
    "we also notice that although it is only an approximation , the perturbation theory would be valid roughly up to @xmath174 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ipr_l1 ] shows the @xmath183 . on the main panel we present the individual contribution of each layer , while on the insets we have the total @xmath183 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon can be observed comparing the different line configurations of the network of layers .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the whole system , @xmath69 , has its associated eigenvector localized in the dominant layer , that is , in the layer generated using @xmath196 .",
    "depending on the position of that layer in the whole system  i.e. , central or peripheral layer  , the contribution of the non - dominant layers to @xmath183 varies .",
    "in particular , when the dominant layer corresponds to an extreme node of the network of layers , the contribution of the other two layers will ordered according to the distance to the dominant one .",
    "consequently , when the dominant layer is in the center of the network of layers , the contributions of the non - dominant ones are comparable -note that in panel c ) of figure  [ fig : ipr_l1 ] , there is no difference in the contribution to @xmath183 of layers generated using @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "as for the first eigenvalue , which is usually enough to analyze the localization as a first order approximation , we observe that the layer with the largest eigenvalue dominates the dynamics .",
    "in addition , note the similarities between the multiplex and the line configuration @xmath199 , where the non - dominant layers behave similarly .",
    "this is because for small values of @xmath153 , the effect of the extra edge in the network of layers ( closing the triangle ) is of order @xmath200 and so the similar behavior observed in panel c ) and d ) of figure  [ fig : ipr_l1 ] for the two configurations .",
    "as @xmath153 grows , the symmetry in the node - aligned multiplex dominates the eigenvector structure and the contributions of all layers are comparable . as we next show , the different contributions of the layers to the total @xmath183 are at the root of the multiple transitions observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : qs_3layer ] shows the susceptibility as a function of @xmath19 for different ratios of @xmath153 .",
    "we observe three well defined peaks on such curves when the ratio @xmath153 is small .",
    "in addition , similar to the 2-layer case , such peaks tend to become less defined and vanish as the ratio @xmath153 increases .",
    "the third peak is less defined than the others because the average number of infected nodes is larger in this case .",
    "consequently the susceptibility tend to be lower , since it measures the variance in relation to the average .",
    "such observation suggests that it could be harder to observe peaks for non - dominating layers that have an individual critical point too far from the dominating layer .",
    "except for the line @xmath201 all figures are similar and present similar peaks , implying that the phase transitions occur approximately at the same point . on the other hand ,",
    "the line @xmath201 shows a slightly different behavior for the second peak , that is found for a larger value of @xmath19 than for the other cases .",
    "such result suggests that when the layer with the largest eigenvalue is located at the center of the line , it can effectively act as a barrier to the disease . in addition , it is verified that the extra inter - edges of the multiplex case does not lead to radical changes on the transition points .",
    "we remark that the susceptibility does not measure the fraction of spreaders in the steady state , thus , despite of the similarities of those curves , the phase diagrams for the incidence of the disease are different .",
    "coming back to what is observed for the network of layers described by the line @xmath201 , an interesting phenomenon arises , namely , the formation of barriers to the epidemic spreading .",
    "since the middle layer has the lowest individual eigenvalue among the layers , it creates a barrier effect `` delaying '' the second transition .",
    "moreover , we observe that such transition also vanishes for higher values of the ratio @xmath153 , if compared to the other cases . this can be related to the inverse participation ratio of @xmath69 , @xmath183 , shown in figure  [ fig : ipr_l1 ] .",
    "note that , for the line @xmath201 , the contribution of the layer @xmath202 is the lowest . as shown in section  [ sec:2l_numerical ] ( and in  @xcite ) , for a 2-layer multiplex , the non - dominant layer has its critical point shifted to a lower value of the spreading rate , which means that the outbreak takes place before it would have happened if that layer were isolated . however , here such shifting is compromised by the fact that the central layer is unable to sustain the epidemic process , acting effectively as a barrier for disease contagion .",
    "apart from this new effect , the system behaves qualitatively similar to the 2-layer scenario .",
    "in this paper , we have generalized and extended previous analysis to the case of multilayer networks . to this end , we have made use of the tensorial representation introduced in  @xcite , which allows to extract upper and lower bounds for the disease incidence of a sis model and the critical points for both , the sis and the sir dynamical processes .",
    "we have also validated our analytical insights with extensive numerical simulations , recovering results like those presented in  @xcite regarding the shifting of the global epidemic threshold to lower values of the spreading rate and the role of the so - called dominant layer .",
    "furthermore , we have observed a transition on the spectra of the supra - contact tensor , from the spectra resulting from the union of the individual layers to the spectra of the network of layers .",
    "such a behavior suggests that other dynamics and more complex structures can also be significantly affected by the interconnected nature of the system .",
    "in addition , we also have characterized analytically the phenomenon of eigenvalue crossing on the supra - contact tensor for two identical layers case .",
    "it is worth noticing that any dynamical process that is described by the same matrix will be affected by this effect .",
    "our main results concern the emergence and vanishing of multiple transitions as a function of the ratio between the inter - layer and intra - layer spreading rates and their relation to the spectral properties of the multilayer , which also reveal the phenomenon of disease localization , in particular , its relation with the existence of crossings or near - crossings of eigenvalues . using the qs - method and monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have been able to precisely determine the transition points .",
    "our results show that it is possible to have multiple phase transitions in multilayer networks , as previously claimed for monoplex systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have proposed an analytical approach based on the use of the inverse participation ratio to characterize such transitions as a localization phenomenon , thus also connecting with @xcite .",
    "a detailed exploration of the parameter space show that as the ratio between the inter - layer and intra - layer spreading rates increases , the peaks of the susceptibility measured for the non - dominat layers tend to occur at lower values of @xmath19 and vanish as @xmath153 increases up to a point in which only one phase transition is observed .",
    "interesting enough , our results point out that such a transition can take place for even lower values of @xmath19 than the inverse of the largest leading eigenvalue among all individual layers .",
    "finally , another important finding presented here is the opposite effect , namely , the fact that a phase transition can take place for a larger value of @xmath19 than expected as a consequence of the multiplex topology . specifically , if the layers are arranged in such a way that one with the smallest leading eigenvalue is at the center of the network of layers ( for instance , as happens for the line @xmath201 configuration ) , then the corresponding transition could be delayed due to a barrier effect . summarizing ,",
    "our results emphasize the importance of studying multilayer systems as they are and not only their individual layers .",
