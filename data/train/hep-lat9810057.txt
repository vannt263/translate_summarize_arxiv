    "qcd sum rule analysis has suggested that a mass - shift occurs in proportion to the baryon density of medium . in nuclear matter , a few to 10 % reduction of vector meson masses is expected @xcite and confirmation of this fact is of current experimental interest .",
    "although the importance of a quantitative investigation on this subject is obvious , it seems difficult to tackle it by present lattice technology.@xcite a new attempt to measure the derivative of mass @xmath1 in terms of the chemical potential , @xmath2 at @xmath3 has been made in this work . at @xmath4 , since the density depends cubically on @xmath5 , @xmath2 vanishes . on the other hand , at finite temperature , a linear dependence on the chemical potential",
    "is expected and we will have a chance to see the density effect .",
    "we use 2 flavors of the wilson fermion for the fermionic part of the action .",
    "the action is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the gauge and the fermionic parts respectively , and @xmath8 has the form , @xmath9 for @xmath7 we use the standard wilson action .",
    "the wilson matrix @xmath10 with chemical potential is written as@xcite @xmath11 \\\\ \\nonumber & & -\\kappa [ ( 1-\\gamma_4)u_4(m)e^{\\mu}\\delta_{m , n+\\hat{4 } } \\\\ \\nonumber & & + ( 1+\\gamma_4)u_i^\\dagger(n-\\hat{4})e^{-\\mu}\\delta_{m , n-\\hat{4}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hadron correlation function @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 may be written as @xmath15 .    to derive the expression of the mass susceptibility on the chemical potential , we take a derivative of @xmath12 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath5 . > from eq.([eq1 ] ) one obtains @xmath16 on the other hand from eq.([eq2 ] ) one obtains @xmath17 .",

    "eq.([eq3 ] ) is evaluated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "eq.([eq4 ] ) contains 4 unknown fitting parameters for a given @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath19 are determined from a fit to the hadronic correlation function of eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "then these results are used for eq.([eq4 ] ) as fixed parameters and , thus the chemical potential dependent terms @xmath20 and @xmath21 are extracted from a two parameter fit to eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "in the present study we aim at obtaining the mass susceptibility at @xmath23 . at @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",

    "this term contains a connected and disconnected diagrams .",
    "we neglect the disconnected part , which is unimportant for the present study .",
    "eq.([eq5 ] ) is written as @xmath33 where the chemical potential @xmath5 is set to zero .",
    "similar calculations are applied for the remaining terms ( for @xmath34 and for @xmath35 ) .",
    "simulations are done on a lattice size of @xmath36 at @xmath37 .    to find a finite temperature transition point ,",
    "the polyakov loop and its susceptibility are calculated , as shown in fig.1 the finite temperature transition happens around @xmath38 . the chemical potential effect on hadron masses at @xmath23 is expected to start in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath38 for the present study .",

    "the configurations are separated by 40 - 50 trajectories .",
    "figs.2 and 3 show the derivative of the hadronic correlation function @xmath41 with respect to @xmath5 as a function of the largest lattice direction : @xmath42 .",
    "the hadronic correlation function is measured in the x - direction .",
    "although the signals within the current statistics are still too noisy , we fit the data using eqs.([eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) . the mass susceptibility , @xmath43 ,",
    "is consistent with zero , while @xmath44 could be finite and positive .",
    "the effect of chemical potential on the mass susceptibility is suppressed by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the baryon mass .",
