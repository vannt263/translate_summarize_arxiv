    "since de gennes pioneering work in 1969 @xcite , liquid crystal elastomers have continually interested theoreticians , in part due to their intriguing mechanical and orientational behavior .",
    "although much knowledge has been accumulated , specially from the application of continuum theories @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , there are just a few insights from microscopic statistical models @xcite .",
    "the neoclassical theory of elasticity is a step forward , as it provides a statistical basis for the elastic properties of nematic elastomers ( nes ) , and has been successfully applied to a number of phenomena @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , is based on a global average tensor for the nematic order parameter , and hence can not be strictly regarded as a microscopic calculation . in a previous paper , we developed a mean - field approach @xcite based on a statistical model used by selinger and ratna @xcite , which combines the neo - classical theory and a lattice version of the maier - saupe theory of the isotropic - nematic transition @xcite .",
    "the present work is an outgrowth of our previous treatment .",
    "we now look at the soft response and the soft transitions of nes .    it is known that nes may exhibit soft response .",
    "one of the typical features of soft behavior is the response of stress to distortion of the sample , as we sketch in fig .",
    "[ softresponse ] . consider a sample of a nematic elastomer that has been initially cross - linked in the nematic state , with orientational order along the anisotropic @xmath0-axis , for example .",
    "in many experiments , the nominal stress is measured as a function of an applied uniaxial deformation along a direction perpendicular to this anisotropy axis ( the @xmath1 axis , for example ) .",
    "let us call @xmath2 the @xmath3-component of the distortion tensor , and @xmath4 the @xmath3-component of the nominal stress .",
    "soft response is observed at the almost level region between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ softresponse ] .",
    "if it is plotted versus strain , the stress presents a rather flat plateau in the soft region .",
    "this plateau is related to a vanishing of the elastic modulus that measures the energy associated with shear in the @xmath7-plane @xcite .",
    "it has been interpreted in terms of rotations of the distribution of shapes of the anisotropic chains without distortion @xcite .",
    "this plateau has also been associated with a genuine phase transition @xcite , with the spontaneous emergence of a non - vanishing shear component of the strain tensor along the @xmath7-plane .",
    "in fact , the @xmath7-component of the strain increases from zero at @xmath5 , reaches a maximum value , and then decreases to zero again at @xmath6 .",
    "the nematic phase is uniaxial for @xmath8 ( along the @xmath0 direction ) and for @xmath9 ( along the @xmath1-direction ) .",
    "-components of the distortion tensor versus the engineering stress tensor . ]    in this paper we investigate the static properties of a mean - field statistical model to describe the soft transition in nematic elastomers .",
    "our most important result is the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram1 ] , in terms of the @xmath3-component of the distortion tensor @xmath2 and temperature @xmath10 .",
    "we characterize a uniaxial and a soft phase .. also , there is no nematic - isotropic transition , since the imposed strain acts as an aligning mechanical field . ] the standard uniaxial phase ( with the nematic anisotropy changing from @xmath0 to @xmath1 directions ) is associated with no shear along the @xmath7-plane .",
    "the soft phase is still uniaxial nematic , but displays a finite shear strain component along the @xmath7-plane .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent second and first - order transitions to the soft phase respectively .",
    "the two continuous transition lines meet the coexistence line at two tricritical points , at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this general qualitative behavior does not depend on the initial nematic order .",
    "in the next section , we use some ideas of our previous approach @xcite to construct a more complete model for the nematic elastomers . in section iii",
    ", we describe some of the steps to obtain the analytical solutions of this problem in the mean - field approximation . in section iv",
    ", we study the numerical solutions of the self - consistent equations and discuss the most important results .",
