    "this programme was started with the aim of making a reliable study of the variability of seyfert galaxies in the near infrared ( @xmath9 bands ; 1.25 , 1.65 , 2.2 and 3.45@xmath0 m ) .",
    "previous work had indicated that some seyfert galaxies do vary , but the data remained somewhat sparse and controversial . at the commencement of the programme",
    "it was believed , for example , that seyfert 1 galaxies varied but seyfert 2 galaxies did not .",
    "a 450-day programme by penston et al ( 1974 ) appeared to confirm this viewpoint .",
    "lebofsky & rieke ( 1980 ) reported on variations observed in several seyferts , of which that in 3c120 was the most spectacular , but the numbers of observations were very limited .    some results from this programme have already been published .",
    "one of the most unexpected was the discovery by clavel , wamsteker and glass ( 1989 ) that there was a delay of  400 days between the uv variations of fairall 9 and the response of its infrared output .",
    "this was satisfactorily interpreted according to a dust reverberation model ( barvainis , 1987 ) .",
    "ngc1566 showed a delay of 2 @xmath10 1 month between the uv and the ir ( baribaud et al , 1992 ) .",
    "similarly , a possible delay of @xmath11d was seen in ngc3783 ( glass , 1992 ) .",
    "the infrared output of ngc1068 was shown to have increased by a factor of two between the early 1970s and 1995 by glass ( 1995 ) .",
    "the galaxy ngc2992 showed an energetic flare - like outburst with a decay time of about 900d ( glass , 1997a ) and ngc7469 showed a dramatic but relatively short - lived decline in its nuclear energy output in october 1989 ( glass 1998 ) .",
    "more recently , salvati et al ( 1993 ) observed an outburst in ngc4051 and nelson ( 1996 ) reported one in mkn744 , with a 32 @xmath10 7 day delay between the visible and ir light curves .",
    "oknyanskij & horne ( 2001 ) have re - examined the published data and concluded that the observed delays are consistent with dust sublimation radii @xmath12 .",
    "oknyanskij ( 2002 ) includes two additional objects .",
    "the angular diameter of the dust ring or shell as viewed fron the earth is of order tenths of milliarcsec .    throughout this paper",
    "it is assumed that the excess infrared radiation from a seyfert when compared to a less active galaxy comes from dust that is heated by ultraviolet radiation originating near a central massive black hole .",
    "it is usually assumed that this dust is distributed in a torus ; e.g. , pier & krolik ( 1992 ) .",
    "the maximum temperature that dust can reach without sublimating , in the neighbourhood of 1600k , together with the ultraviolet luminosity of the nucleus , sets the inner radius of its distribution and the corresponding light travel time gives the delay in the response of a dust grain to a change in the ultraviolet flux from the nucleus .    during part of the present programme ,",
    "@xmath13 photometry was obtained by winkler et al ( 1992 ) , winkler ( 1997 ) and other observers .",
    "the choice of galaxies to observe was very simple : only a few southern seyferts were known at the start of the programme . as others were discovered , by examination of the eso and uk schmidt plates or from x - ray satellites , they were included .",
    "the @xmath6-band luminosities ( calculated from the redshifts and the fluxes seen through a 12 arcsec diameter aperture ) range over three orders of magnitude .",
    "it will be seen later that the proportion of nuclear to underlying galaxy fluxes also covers a large range .",
    "nearly all the observations were made with the mkiii infrared photometer attached to the 1.9 m telescope at sutherland .",
    "the aperture was normally 12 arcsec diameter . in some cases ,",
    "@xmath6 observations were made at 9 arcsec diameter to improve the signal - to - noise ratio at slight expense to the systematic accuracy .",
    "the chopper throw was 30 arcsec , alternately north and south of the object position .",
    "the same filters were used throughout the programme .",
    "standard stars were taken from carter ( 1990 ) , whose @xmath5 measures were transformed to the natural system of the photometer using the empirical relation @xmath14 .",
    "the other bands were taken to be the same on both systems .",
    "the results were placed on the carter system using the inverse transformation .",
    "table 1 lists the galaxies included in the survey .",
    "the positions , redshifts , seyfert types , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 were taken from vron - cetty & vron ( 2000 ) .",
    "the absorption @xmath8 arising in our own galaxy was calculated from the nasa / ipac database extinction calculator on the worldwide web , which is based on schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the columns @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the overall observed amplitudes observed at @xmath5 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that these two quantities are sensitive to errors in individual measurements , and are , in effect , upper limits .",
    "the column ` no ' gives the number of observations of each object .",
    "the last three columns give the average dereddened near - ir colours .",
    "observations were usually made four times per year over periods of a week .",
    "usually a given galaxy could be observed three times per year , with one or two repeats within a few days . in a few cases ,",
    "several observations were made over a short period as part of international multi - wavelength campaigns .",
    "figs 2 a , b , c , d show the observations plotted against time . the same time and magnitude",
    "scales are employed throughout , for ease of comparison .",
    "additional data obtained by other workers in the @xmath4 band have been included in several cases .",
    "the error bars have been plotted only when they are expected to be substantial . normally , the standard errors at @xmath19 , arising from the standard stars and the uncertainties in the extinctions , are expected to be @xmath200.03 mag and , at @xmath6 , @xmath200.05 mag . in general , these are the dominant errors . however , at @xmath6 the signal - to - noise ratio was reduced and observations were usually limited to about 320 sec of integration , so that the final errors may be higher than 0.05 mag , especially when @xmath6 @xmath3 9 ."
