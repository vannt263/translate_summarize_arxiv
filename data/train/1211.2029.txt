    "surface electromagnetic waves represent a specific kind of macroscopic perturbations which propagate along interfaces between different media . the electromagnetic field in such waves decay exponentially away from the interface deep into both media . a very important example of surface waves is the so - called plasmon - polaritons observed at the interfaces between a normal metal and a dielectric at frequencies about the plasma frequency @xmath0 , which belongs to the optical or far - infrared ranges  @xcite .",
    "plasmon - polaritons are central in numerous resonance phenomena .",
    "examples of these are : ( i ) the extraordinary transmission of light through metal films with subwavelength holes  @xcite ; ( ii ) an `` inverse '' effect of the resonant suppression of light transmission through modulated metal films with thicknesses less than the skin - depth  @xcite ; ( iii ) the wood anomalies in the reflectivity  @xcite and transmissivity  @xcite of periodically - corrugated metal samples .",
    "these optical anomalies could have potential applications for photovoltaics , light control , filtering and detection of radiation in far - infrared and visible frequency ranges .",
    "it would be very desirable to similarly control the electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz ( thz ) frequency range .",
    "the mastering of this range ( 0.310 thz ) is a rapidly developing area of research due to promising applications . in principle",
    ", plasmon - polaritons can exist at @xmath1 .",
    "however , the dispersion curves of plasmon - polaritons are very close to the light - line @xmath2 in the thz frequency range . in this case",
    ", the surface waves are almost extended  @xcite , in the sense that they are very weakly localized in the dielectric over distances of about 1  meter ( here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the frequency and wave vector of plasmon - polaritons , @xmath5 is the permittivity of the dielectric , and @xmath6 is the speed of light ) .",
    "therefore , most of the electromagnetic energy flows out of the sample , leading to strong radiation losses . to overcome this disadvantage , new systems , e.g. , layered superconductors instead of metals ,",
    "should be considered in order to observe surface waves .",
    "layered superconductors are strongly anisotropic media where the current along the crystallographic * ab*-plane is similar to the current in bulk superconductors , whereas transport along the @xmath7-axis is caused by the intrinsic josephson effect through the layers ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "therefore , layered superconductors are characterized by two different plasma frequencies  @xcite .",
    "one of them is of the order of @xmath0 for normal metals , but the other one is much smaller and it coincides with the so - called _ josephson plasma frequency _",
    "@xmath8  thz . as was shown in refs .",
    ", the lower plasma frequency , @xmath9 , defines the spectrum of surface waves in layered superconductors .",
    "namely , due to this feature the dispersion curves of the surface waves in layered superconductors , in contrast to normal metals , deviate substantially from the light - line , and these waves are well localized in the thz frequency range .",
    "surface josephson plasma waves ( sjpws ) can propagate along the interface between the external dielectric and layered superconductor for both geometries , when the superconducting layers are parallel to the sample surface or are perpendicular to it .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "the spectrum of sjpws propagating along the layers consists of two branches , one above @xmath9 and the other below it .",
    "the spectrum of surface electromagnetic waves propagating across the layers was predicted and studied analytically in refs .  .",
    "in this paper , we study theoretically the excitation of the oblique surface waves ( osws ) propagating at some angle @xmath10 with respect to the crystallographic * c*-axis , which is assumed to be parallel to the interface between a dielectric and a layered superconductor .",
    "we analyze the so - called attenuated - total - reflection ( atr ) method for the osw excitation using an additional dielectric prism with permittivity @xmath11 .",
    "the external electromagnetic wave from a dielectric prism is incident on a superconductor separated from the prism by a thin dielectric gap with permittivity @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the absence of a superconductor ,",
    "the incident wave completely reflects from the bottom of the prism , if the incident angle @xmath13 exceeds the limit angle @xmath14 for total internal reflection .",
    "however , _",
    "the evanescent wave penetrates under the prism _ a distance about a wavelength , reaching the layered superconductor and penetrating it .",
    "the wave vector of the evanescent mode is along the bottom surface of the prism and its value is higher than @xmath15 .",
    "this feature is the same as for surface waves .",
    "thus , for a certain resonance incident angle , the spatial - and - temporal matching ( the frequencies and wave vectors coincide ) of the evanescent wave and the surface wave takes place .",
    "( color online ) schematic geometry for the excitation of oblique surface waves .",
    "the wave vectors of the incident , reflected , and oblique surface waves are denoted as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "note that here s = superconductor and i = insulator.,width=8,height=5 ]    it is important to note that the excitation of the oblique surface wave is accompanied by another important resonance phenomenon .",
    "evidently , the anisotropy of the current - carrying capability along the surface of the superconductor results in a conversion of the polarization of the terahertz radiation after reflection from the boundary of the layered superconductor .",
    "if the incident wave has , e.g. , a transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization ( a wave with the _ magnetic _ field parallel to the sample surface ) , the reflected electromagnetic field contains a transverse electric ( te ) wave ( with the _ electric _ field parallel to the sample surface ) .",
    "moreover , as was shown in ref .  , the _ complete _ transformation of the wave polarization can be observed at an appropriate choice of the direction of the incident wave vector .",
    "we stress that this phenomenon is different from the brewster effect . in the latter , light with tm polarization , for a definite incidence angle ,",
    "is completely transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface , and , thus , the reflected light has only te polarization .",
    "however , in the phenomenon presented here , the reflected wave is te - polarized when the incoming wave _ does not contain the wave with this polarization_. in other words , the reflected wave is te - polarized because of the _ conversion _ of the incident tm wave , but not because of the _ separation _ of the te - polarized wave from the _ mixed _ ( tm+te ) incoming wave",
    ".    the ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected te and tm waves is controlled by the wave frequency @xmath3 , angles @xmath10 and @xmath13 , and the thickness @xmath19 of the dielectric gap .",
    "the main point is the to choose the angles @xmath10 and @xmath13 for the incident wave such that the amplitude of the tm reflected wave vanishes .",
    "it is known that , in the case of an _ isotropic _ metal , one can select the optimal value of the gap thickness @xmath19 to provide the complete suppression of the reflected wave in resonance . similarly , in the case of an _ anisotropic _ superconductor , we can select the best value of the angle @xmath10 to provide the complete suppression of the reflected tm wave in resonance . in the latter case ,",
    "one part of the incident energy flux dissipates in the layered superconductor and the other part is reflected as the te wave . the theoretical study of the interplay of the osws excitation and the transformation of the wave polarization after its reflection from the boundary of the layered superconductor is the main goal of this paper .",
    "thus , a layered superconductor plays two important roles in the phenomenon studied in this paper , which a simple metal or an isotropic superconductor can not .",
    "first , due to the smallness of the josephson current across the layers , the excited oblique surface waves are well localized in the terahertz frequency range .",
    "second , due to the strong current anisotropy in the surface of the layered superconductor , the excitation of oblique surface waves is accompanied by the transformation of the incident wave polarization after its reflection .",
    "moreover , the complete transformation of the polarization can be achieved by the appropriate choice of the direction of the wave incidence .    in the next sections ,",
    "we derive and analyze the dispersion relation for the oblique surface waves , and then study analytically the osws excitation by the atr method and the transformation of the electromagnetic wave polarization .",
    "for this purpose , we calculate the electromagnetic field in the dielectric prism , in the dielectric gap , and in the layered superconductor , by solving the maxwell equations with appropriate material equations and boundary conditions .",
    "the electromagnetic field in the dielectric prism is presented as a sum of the incident tm - polarized wave and two reflected waves with tm and te polarizations . in the dielectric gap",
    ", we consider four evanescent waves , namely , increasing and decreasing tm- and te - polarized waves .",
    "the evanescent field in the layered superconductor consists of the ordinary and extraordinary decreasing waves .",
    "then , using the continuity conditions for the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields at the two interfaces ( i.e. , the dielectric gap - dielectric prism and the layered superconductor - dielectric gap ) , we express all wave amplitudes via the amplitude of the incident wave . using these expressions",
    ", we derive the reflection coefficient @xmath20 for the tm wave and the conversion coefficient @xmath21 for the mode transformation from tm to te , as well as the expression for the portion @xmath22 of the energy flux which comes to the excitation of the oblique surface wave and then dissipates in the superconductor .",
    "let the interface dividing an isotropic dielectric and a layered superconductor be located in the @xmath23 plane ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the dielectric region ( @xmath24 ) and the layered superconductor region ( @xmath25 ) are semi - infinite along the @xmath26-axis .",

    "the ordinary and extraordinary waves decay deep into the superconductor according to the same exponential law , @xmath44 with imaginary normal component of the wave vector , @xmath45    the electromagnetic field in the layered superconductor is related to the spatial distribution of the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath46 of the order parameter between neighboring layers .",
    "this phase difference can be found by a solution of a set of coupled sine - gordon equations ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in the continuum limit",
    ", @xmath46 can be excluded from the set of equations for the electromagnetic fields . in this case , the layered superconductors can be described in terms of usual macroscopic electrodynamics with an anisotropic frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity with components @xmath47 and @xmath48 across and along the layers , respectively . indeed , according to ref .",
