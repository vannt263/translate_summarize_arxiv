    "during the last years a lot of effort has been expended in the study of the physics of extra dimensions .",
    "especially the assumed brane picture of our world has attracted much interest , mainly because of the new insight offering in particle physics beyond the standard model , in cosmology and the interplay between them .",
    "one of the main topics that the brane world models have been invoked for is the hierarchy problem @xcite which is connected with the origin of the mass scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . on the other hand these models have their origin in string theory where supersymmetry is a basic ingredient @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues that may be addressed in supersymmetric brane world models is the mediation of the supersymmetry breaking and the determination of the soft - breaking terms appearing in the corresponding four - dimensional low energy theories .",
    "these models may be constructed by orbifolding a supersymmetric five dimensional theory with a compact extra dimension .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is triggered on the hidden brane , which in some sense replaces the hidden sector of four spacetime dimensional models @xcite , and through the bulk is communicated to the visible brane @xcite .",
    "this transmission results to finite one - loop mass corrections for the scalar fields that live on the visible brane .",
    "the induced corrections have been already calculated in @xcite and result to tachyonic masses , although it has been claimed that a full treatment of the radion multiplet may turn this picture yielding positive masses squared .    in this work",
    "we study the transmission of the supersymmetry breaking in @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity @xcite compactified on a @xmath3 orbifold by working directly in the on - shell scheme .",
    "the orbifolding determines two branes , the visible brane located at @xmath10 and the hidden one at @xmath11 .",
    "we construct the @xmath0 supesymmetric couplings of the brane chiral multiplets with the bulk fields and found that they are determined by a k@xmath12lher function reminiscent of the no - scale model @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian derived in this way describes the full brane - radion coupling at least to order @xmath4 , which is adequate for our purposes . assuming a constant superpotential on the hidden brane we calculated at one - loop the soft scalar masses squared @xmath13 , induced by the mediation of the radion multiplet .",
    "these were found to be positive .",
    "moreover by considering a typical cubic superpotential @xmath14 on the visible brane we found that trilinear scalar couplings are also induced which are non - vanishing .",
    "in a relatively recent publication @xcite we addressed the problem of the coupling of n=1 multiplets on the boundary branes in the context of five - dimensional n=2 supergavity orbifolds . for chiral brane multiplets we derived the coupling to all orders in the gravitational coupling",
    "constant with the bulk gavitational fields , the graviton and the gravitino . for the derivation we worked in the on - shell scheme using nther procedure .",
    "the alternative of using off - shell formulation proves too tedious due to the fact that the theory is described by numerous auxiliary fields . besides in the on - shell scheme",
    "the possible gaugings have been classified which is essential when one wants to promote the theory to a unified theory into which the standard model is embedded . in that work",
    "we did not derive the full couplings of the radion multiplet to the brane fields .",
    "the radion multiplet propagates in the bulk but it also consists of even fields able to couple to the brane fields . the first order term in the five dimensional gravitational constant , already derived in @xcite , was found to be @xmath15 but this by itself is not sufficient for the study of the mediation of the supersymmetry breaking from the hidden to the visible brane .",
    "one may continue using nther procedure in order to complete the brane with the radion multiplet couplings .",
    "however this task turns out to be cumbersome after a few steps and one may seek an alternative way to derive these terms systematically using the standard knowledge of n=1 , d=4 supergavity .",
    "this is undertaken in this work .",
    "the main observation is that the restriction of the radion fields @xmath16 on the brane form a chiral multiplet having lowest order transformation laws given by @xmath17 note the appearence of the combination @xmath18 in this transformation law .",
    "the couplings of the radion superfield with the other brane and gravity fields will be described by a khler function , say @xmath19 , in the usual manner encountered in n=1 , d=4 supergravity @xcite .",
    "for convenience one can split this function as @xmath20 , where the first term describes the restriction of the five dimensional supergravity on the brane , which survives even in the absence of brane multiplets , and the second is associated with the presence of brane multiplets . from our previous analysis",
    "@xcite we concluded that the form of the second function is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "for the determination of the first function @xmath23 we observe that by applying nther s approach in the most natural and plausible manner , avoiding as much as possible mathematical complexities , it turns out that the restriction of the five dimensional supergravity action on the branes does not take its familiar 4-dimensional form .",
    "in fact all terms in the gravitational part of the action involve the determinant of the five - dimensional metric @xmath24 , instead of @xmath25 , and besides there are no kinetic terms for the real part @xmath26 of the scalar field @xmath27 and the spinor field @xmath28 of the chiral radion multiplet .",
    "the same situation can be also encountered in ordinary n=1 , d=4 supergravity , where for a chiral multiplet @xmath29 for instance , by appropriate weyl rescalings , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , followed by appropriate shifts in the gravitino field , one can eliminate the kinetic terms for @xmath32 , having as an effect the appearance of @xmath33 instead of @xmath25 in the lagrangian . from this",
    "it becomes obvious that one needs the inverse transformations to be implemented in @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity lagrangian , derived by applying nther s proceedure .",
    "these are given by @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , and are able to cast the bulk lagrangian , and especially its restriction on the branes , in the typical form reminiscent of the @xmath0 , @xmath36 supergravity in which the kinetic terms for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are present . in eq .",
    "( [ trans2 ] ) the hatted fields are those describing the original @xmath1 , @xmath2 action . then in terms of the transformed ( unhatted ) fields the couplings of the brane fields are those of the n=1 , d=4 supergravity derived from the khler function @xmath39 at this point let us remark that in this lagrangian one has to substitute @xmath40 and @xmath41 since these combinations actuall appear in the 5-d supersymmetric transformations of the fields .",

    "some comments concerning the above lagrangian are in order : the part @xmath47 contains both the terms describing the interaction of the radion multiplet with the fields localized on the branes and also terms involving only the radion multiplet fields which live in the bulk .",
    "this is due to the particular form of the khler metric arising from the khler function @xmath48 of eq .",

    "moreover we see that these terms remain on the brane multiplied by @xmath51 .",
    "cancellation of the @xmath52 terms in the kinetic part of @xmath53 can be achieved if one adds pure gravity terms and gravitino kinetic terms localized on the brane .",
    "however since this is not mandatory for the n=1 supersymmetry invariance of the brane action we choose to keep the pure supergravity part in the bulk as it appears above . notice the presence of the term @xmath54 in eq .",

    "an additional contribution @xmath55 stems from the remaining terms of eq .",

    "such singularities are not new and also occur in n=2 five - dimensional supersymmetries in flat space - time n=2 , d=5 supersymmetries where they cure singularities arising from the propagation of the bulk fields in order to maintain supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the negative term of the potential @xmath62 flips its sign in the scalar potential if we consider the coupling with the radion multiplet . to illustrate this we consider for simplicity just one chiral multiplet on the visible brane with superpotential given by @xmath63 and a khler function @xmath64 .",
    "then the scalar potential up to @xmath4 order is found to be @xmath65 thus despite the fact that a negative term appears in the potential nevertheless the potential turns always positive .",
