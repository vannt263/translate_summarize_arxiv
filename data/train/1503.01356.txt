    "the aurivillius phases are layered bismuth compounds that obey the general formula bi@xmath4a@xmath5b@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the family includes many members that present ferroelectricity at room temperature , and they have been widely studied for potential technological applications mainly in thin film nonvolatile memories.@xcite srbi@xmath0ta@xmath0o@xmath1 ( sbt ) and srbi@xmath0nb@xmath0o@xmath1 ( sbn ) are members of the family , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 and their structure is formed by alternating two srmo@xmath10 ( m@xmath11ta , nb ) perovskite blocks and one bi@xmath0o@xmath0 slab ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "tantalum and niobium present very similar physical and chemical properties , including the valence and atomic radii . as a result , sbt and sbn present isomorphous polar structures at room temperature @xcite and analogous mechanical and electrical characteristics .",
    "however , their phase diagrams are qualitatively different : on increasing the temperature sbt undergoes a phase transition to a non - polar orthorhombic phase that does not arise in sbn .",
    "@xcite    previous first - principles calculations by perez - mato _ et al _ revealed that the trilinear coupling of two primary unstable modes and a secondary hard mode is critical to stabilize the ground state of sbt .",
    "@xcite this work provided a simple and plausible scheme in contrast with others alternatives where the eventual existance of negative biquadratic coupling triggers the simultaneous condensation of several modes .",
    "@xcite later , the key role of the trilinear coupling has been found in several other compounds@xcite and its influence has been proposed as the origen of the so - called _ _",
    "avalanche__@xcite phase transitions and the _ hybrid _ improper ferroelectricity.@xcite    in this work we revisit the sbt and extend the _ ab initio _ study to sbn in order to investigate the role of the trilinear coupling in the stabilization of the ferroelectric structure and its influence in the sequences of phase diagrams .",
    "the high- and low - temperatures structures of sbt and sbn are isomorphous : tetragonal with space group @xmath12 ( no .",
    "139 ) at high enough temperatures@xcite and orthorhombic @xmath13 ( no . 36 ) at low temperatures . in the case of sbn",
    "there is a direct phase transition from the tetragonal to the ferroelectric structure at 800k,@xcite whereas sbt presents an intermediate nonpolar orthorhombic @xmath14 phase ( no . 63 ) between 500 - 600k and 770k .",
    "the cell parameters of the two orthorhombic phases are related to the tetragonal ones according to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which means that the volume of the unit cell is doubled in the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transitions .",
    "the tetragonal space group ( @xmath12 ) is a supergroup of the two orthorhombic space groups , the intermediate phase of sbt ( @xmath14 ) and the ground state of both compounds ( @xmath13 ) . in consequence",
    ", the low temperature structures can be described in terms of symmetry - adapted distortions with respect to the parent tetragonal structure .",
    "@xcite table [ tab : mode_decomposition ] shows this decomposition in terms of the symmetry - adapted modes that break the tetragonal symmetry for the experimental structures of sbt and sbn obtained with the aid of the tool amplimodes ( www.cryst.ehu.es ) .",
    "@xcite the hierarchy of the modes is similar in both compounds : the amplitude of @xmath18 is dominant and can be considered as the primary order parameter and the @xmath19 distortion seems to play a secondary role .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath20 polar distortion is more delicate because due to the polar character of the ground state its amplitude depends on the origin . in table",
    "[ tab : mode_decomposition ] the chosen origin does not change the arithmetic center of the parent structure . according to the isotropy subgroups the intermediate phase of sbt is naturally explained as a condensation of the @xmath18 mode , and in terms of the landau theory of phase transitions the @xmath21 transition can be continuous .",
    "the second transition to the ferroelectric structure should then consist on the condensation of the polar mode . in the case of sbn a direct transition between the tetragonal and the ferroelectric phase",
    "can be solely described by a simultaneous condensation of at least any pair of the three modes , and according to landau theory , it should be first order : the three relevant modes condense simultaneously in an _ avalanche _ phase transition @xcite .",
    "the orthorhombic strain is usually very small in the aurivillius compounds and sbt is not an exception .",
    "the experimental values of cell parameters in sbt are @xmath22   and @xmath23   for the tetragonal structure , @xcite and @xmath24  , @xmath25  and @xmath26   for the ferroelectric phase.@xcite the deformation of the cell is very small with @xmath27 ( all within a 0.5 @xmath28 margin ) , and the influence of strain can be considered as a residual effect . up to our knowledge , there is not such an experimental data available for the tetragonal cell of sbn , and the orthorhombic cell parameters are @xmath29  and @xmath30  and @xmath31   .",
    "@xcite    a complete description of the atomic displacements associated with the three modes can be found in ref . .",
    "in summary , among the 18 degrees of freedom that constitute a generic distortion that links the tetragonal and ferroelectric structure , seven correspond to @xmath32 , and they mainly account for tiltings of the oxygen octahedra around the @xmath33 direction of the tetragonal cell and displacements of the bi cations along the @xmath34 direction .",
    "the octahedra behave as rigid units and , in consequence , neighboring octahedra show antiphase tiltings .",
    "the polar @xmath35 distortion involves essentially an antiphase displacement of the bi atoms and the perovskite blocks , along the @xmath33 direction . among the eight independent displacements associated with the @xmath36 distortion",
    "the main amplitudes correspond to tiltings of the oxygen octahedra around the @xmath37 axis and antiphase displacements of the oxygens in the bi@xmath0o@xmath0 slabs along the @xmath33 direction .",
    ".summary of the mode decomposition of the experimental and calculated distortions of the ferroelectric phases of sbt and sbn with respect to their corresponding parent ( calculated and experimental ) structures .",
    "amplitudes are given for modes normalized within the primitive unit cell of the polar structure .",
    "the second row shows in parentheses the scalar product of the calculated and experimental polarization vectors after normalization . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "despite the different sequence of phase transitions that sbt and sbn go through , first principles calculations shows that the nature and main features of the instabilities in both compounds are qualitatively very similar , and that most of the conclusions about sbt obtained in ref . can be extended to sbn . among the three symmetry adapted distortions ( @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) that take part to drive the tetragonal @xmath12 parent phase to the polar @xmath13 structure",
    ", @xmath32 is dominant with the highest amplitude and the deepest energy well ( @xmath38 11 mry per formula unit ) .",
    "the depths of the secondary distortions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are similar in sbn ( @xmath38 3.5 mry p.f.u . ) , while in sbt @xmath36 is hardly unstable and @xmath35 slightly deeper ( 5.2 mry p.f.u . ) .    in both compounds , the simultaneous condensation of the primary instability @xmath32 with any of the other two distortions",
    "is penalized energetically by positive strong biquadratic couplings .",
    "thus , the trilinear coupling is the key ingredient that allows the simultaneous condensation of the three modes and its role is essential to stabilize the observed ground state .",
    "the most noticeable difference between sbt and sbn is associated with the magnitude of the trilinear term .",
    "the polynomial expansion of the energy of both compounds shows that the trilinear coupling is much stronger in sbn than in sbt , suggesting that its magnitude could be crucial to suppress the intermediate phase in sbn .",
    "moreover , the analysis of phenomenological phase diagrams for sbt and sbn shows that a higher value of this constant is enough to change the topology of the phase diagram , allowing a direct phase transition from the parent phase to the ground state .    finally , a simplified @xmath3 hamiltonian that retains the symmetry requirements and the correct dimensionality of the order parameters has been developed for the sbt / sbn system .",
    "monte carlo simulations do not show qualitatively differences in comparison with the one - dimensional case@xcite : the different sequence of phase transitions observed in both compounds can be reproduced by changing the strength of the trilinear coupling .",
    "however , according to the present calculations , the increment of the fluctuations associated with the higher dimensionality of the order parameters tends to favour the suppression of the intermediate phase and to reinforce the first order character of the direct transition between the high- and low - temperature structures .",
