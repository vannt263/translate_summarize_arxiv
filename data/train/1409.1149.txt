    "the basic features of quantum mechanics are worked out about 90 years ago : the schrdinger equation is linear and allows superpositions of quantum states to be solutions of the schrdinger equation ; the hamiltonian @xmath3 describing the system is hermitian , its eigenvalues @xmath4 are real and its eigenfunctions @xmath5 are normalized according to @xmath6 .",
    "the system described in this manner is _ closed _ since its coupling to an environment is not involved in the theory .",
    "the finite lifetime of most states of a ( small ) system is calculated by means of tunneling , without taking into account any feedback from the environment onto the system .",
    "this theory is proven experimentally during multi - year studies performed on different systems at low level density .",
    "for the last years , not only the resolution of most experimental devices has increased considerably but also calculations with higher accuracy have become possible . as a result , the standard quantum theory has shown its limit to describe successfully experimental results .",
    "counterintuitive results are obtained in different experiments .",
    "an example is the observation of an unexpected regularity of the measured transmission phases ( so - called phase lapses ) in mesoscopic systems @xcite which could not explained in the framework of hermitian quantum physics in spite of much effort @xcite .",
    "they are explainable however by considering the feedback from the environment onto the system @xcite .",
    "another example is the experimental observation and theoretical description of a _ dynamical phase transition ( dpt ) _ in the spin swapping operation @xcite .",
    "while fermi s golden rule holds below the dpt , it is violated above it . in a new experimental paper @xcite ,",
    "the formation of a protected sub - band for conduction in quantum point contacts under extreme biasing is found , see also @xcite .",
    "this sub - band is a collective robust mode of non - equilibrium transport that is immune to local heating .",
    "it has potential practical implications for nanoscale devices made of quantum point contacts and quantum dots .    in order to improve the theoretical description , in some papers",
    "the coupling of the system to an environment is taken into account explicitly .",
    "mostly , this is done by replacing the hermitian hamilton operator , or part of it , by a non - hermitian one , see e.g. the reviews @xcite and the book @xcite .",
    "in other papers , nonlinearities are added to the schrdinger equation .",
    "an example is the review @xcite where the role of nonlinear fano resonances in theoretical and experimental studies of light propagation in photonic devices and charge transport through quantum dots ( nanostructures ) is reviewed . by this means , the description of experimental results could be improved considerably in all cases .",
    "a non - hermitian hamiltonian in the schrdinger equation appears when the system is considered to be _ open _ ,",
    "i.e. to be embedded into an environment , and the coupling between the system and its environment is taken into account from the very beginning .",
    "a natural environment is the continuum of scattering wavefunctions to which the states of the system are coupled and into which they decay .",
    "it can be changed by external fields , however never be deleted .",
    "the finite lifetime of the states of the system is calculated directly from the non - hermitian part of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the feedback from the environment onto the system is involved in the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 and therefore also in its eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8 . the basic assumption of this description is supported experimentally by the recent observation that remote states are coupled through the continuum @xcite .",
    "meanwhile there are many calculations performed with a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "usually , the behavior of the system is controlled by means of varying a certain parameter .",
    "the restriction of the parameter dependence of the hamiltonian @xmath0 to its explicitly non - hermitian part ( by neglecting the parameter dependence of its real hermitian part ) allows us to receive a quick overview on the spectroscopic redistribution processes occurring in the system under the influence of the coupling to the environment , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "most interesting is the appearance of unexpected collective coherent phenomena in different systems .",
    "they are similar to the phenomenon of dicke superradiance @xcite which is known in optics for many years .",
    "it has been shown , moreover , that the reorganization of the spectrum of the system under the influence of the coupling to the environment at a critical value of the control parameter , occurs globally over the whole energy range of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it takes place by a _",
    "cooperative action of all states _ , and the length scale diverges as well as the degree of non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "it has been shown further that the reordering of the spectrum corresponds , indeed , to a second - order phase transition @xcite , justifying the notation _ dynamical phase transition_. the states below and beyond the dpt are non - analytically connected .",
    "this method is shown to describe also phase transitions in , e.g. , biological systems @xcite .    the calculation of the eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8 of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 hits upon some mathematically non - trivial problems due to the existence of singular points in the continuum . at these points ,",
    "two eigenvalues coalesce and the two corresponding eigenfunctions differ from one another only by a phase @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase of these points differs from the berry phase of a diabolic point by a factor 2 .",
    "these singular points , called usually _ exceptional points ( eps ) _ , are well - known in mathematics @xcite .",
    "their meaning for the dynamics of open quantum systems and the behavior of the two eigenfunctions at an ep is however studied only recently .",
    "numerical results for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath0 under the influence of an ep in a concrete system are obtained , e.g. , for atoms @xcite , for the transmission through quantum dots @xcite and for charge transport in molecular networks @xcite . in the early papers ,",
    "the eps are called mostly _ branch points in the complex plane _ or _ double poles of the s matrix_. phase transitions in open quantum systems which are associated with the formation of long - lived and short - lived states according to @xcite , are related to eps first in @xcite .",
    "more recent results can be found in the review @xcite .",
    "the drawback of all these studies is the unsolved question how different eps influence one another and how they are related to a dpt .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a symmetric non - hermitian operator @xmath9 are biorthogonal according to @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( where @xmath7 is a complex eigenvalue of @xmath12 ) .",
    "they have to be normalized therefore by means of @xmath13 which is a complex number ( in difference to the norm @xmath14 which is a real number ) .",
    "in order to guarantee a smooth transition from the description of an open quantum system to an almost ( and eventually really ) closed one , the eigenfunctions of @xmath0 should be normalized according to @xmath15 .",
    "this is possible only by the additional requirement im@xmath16 .",
    "this condition implies that the relation between the phases of the two states @xmath17 and @xmath18 is , generally , not rigid : far from an ep , the two wavefunctions are ( almost ) orthogonal to one another in ( nearly ) the same manner as the eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator while they become linearly dependent in approaching an ep @xcite such that the biorthogonality of them can not be neglected .",
    "this is quantitatively expressed by the _ phase rigidity _",
    "@xmath19 which is reduced in approaching an ep , @xmath20 . here",
    ", the environment can put its information into the system by aligning states of the system with states of the environment , i.e. by enhancing their decay width .",
    "the phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions and its reduction near to the singular ep is the most interesting value when a realistic quantum system is described by a schrdinger equation with non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "since the environment is able to change the spectroscopic properties of the system only if @xmath21 , an ep may influence strongly the dynamics of an open quantum system .",
    "this is in contrast to a closed system described by a hermitian operator and rigid phases ( @xmath22 ) of its eigenfunctions . in @xcite ,",
    "the correlation between non - rigid phases of the eigenfunctions @xmath8 of the non - hermitian hamiltonian in the neighborhood of an ep and the transmission through a quantum dot is demonstrated in calculations for a special quantum dot .",
    "the enhancement is a collective effect caused by @xmath21 for many levels @xmath17 in a certain finite parameter range .",
    "it has been shown further @xcite that the schrdinger equation of the system contains nonlinear terms when @xmath21 , i.e. in the neighborhood of eps .",
    "in contrast to the usual calculations , it is therefore not necessary to introduce nonlinear terms into the schrdinger equation by hand .",
    "they are part and parcel of the non - hermitian quantum physics , and appear _ only _ in the vicinity of eps ( where @xmath21 ) .",
    "recently , non - hermitian hamiltonians are studied the eigenvalues of which are real in a broad parameter range @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian become complex as shown theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "the meaning of eps for these processes is studied in different papers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "less studied is the question whether or not these processes can be considered to be a dpt in the sense described above .",
    "the main problem is similar to that appearing in the description of the dicke superradiance , an effect known for many years @xcite , however not fully understood up to today . in both cases ,",
    "the experimental studies are performed in optics . while the formal equivalence of the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation and the optical wave equation in symmetric optical lattices @xcite is explored in the first case for an interpretation of the experimental results , a comparable theoretical study does not exist in the second case , i.e. for the dicke superradiance .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to study the meaning of the mathematical non - trivial properties of non - hermitian operators for the physics of open quantum systems that are embedded into a _ common well - defined _ environment .",
    "the mathematical properties are the existence of singular points ( eps ) ; the reduced phase rigidity ( @xmath23 ) in their vicinity ; the appearance of nonlinear terms in the schrdinger equation due to @xmath21 ; and the appearance of _ constructive _ interferences .",
    "the physical observable effects are dpts known to appear at high level density .",
    "they will be discussed in the following paper @xcite .    in our calculations",
    "we use a schematic model to simulate typical features of open quantum systems that are induced _",
    "coherently by the common environment_. the obtained results are generic .",
    "the basic formalism used by us , is worked out in nuclear physics many years ago @xcite where it is , however , used by introducing the non - hermiticity by means of a perturbation and , furthermore , by using statistical assumptions for the individual states ( mostly according to random matrix theory ) . in contrast to this , we consider directly the individual eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8 of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the influence of the eps onto these values . as very well known ,",
    "the eigenvalues show level repulsion and ( or ) width bifurcation .",
    "we show that the eigenfunctions contain new information , because they characterize the parameter range over which the influence of the eps can be seen and the manner how different eps may influence each another .",
    "in the present paper , we consider a two - level system with real , complex and imaginary coupling coefficients between system and environment with _ loss _",
    "( emission ) of particles to the environment ( sect .",
    "[ two1 ] ) which is the usual situation of quantum systems embedded into the environment of scattering wavefunctions . in sect .",
    "[ two2 ] we consider systems in which additionally _ gain _ ( absorption ) of particles from the environment occurs what is discussed recently in literature , e.g. @xcite .    in a following paper @xcite",
    ", we address finally the problem of the relation between eps and dpts in systems with more than two nearby states coupled via a common environment . here",
    "different eps may influence each other .",
    "phase transitions are studied since very many years in different physical systems . in spite of their special features characteristic of every system , common to all of them",
    "is that the states at one side of the transition are not analytically connected to those at the other side .",
    "recently , phase transitions are observed experimentally and investigated theoretically also in small open quantum systems .",
    "mostly , the results are counterintuitive , when considered from the point of view of hermitian quantum physics .",
    "some years ago , results of such a type could be explained qualitatively in the framework of non - hermitian quantum physics by relating them to a phase transition occurring in an open quantum system @xcite . at the same time , these results are related @xcite to the existence of singular points @xcite , the so - called exceptional points ( ep ) , emerging in the non - hermitian formalism .    by",
    "now , we have a much better understanding of these phenomena , especially in the field of mesoscopic physics where it is possible to trace the phase transition by means of parameter variation .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in the recent review @xcite where theory based on non - hermitian quantum physics , is confronted with known experimental results on open quantum systems . in recent papers ,",
    "this type of phase transition is called mostly _ dynamical phase transition ( dpt ) _ in order to underline its relation to the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "much less understood are similar phenomena in optics although they are known experimentally for a long time , e.g. the dicke superradiance @xcite .    as a result of many differnt studies during last years ( for references see @xcite ) , the singular eps of the non - hermitian formalism play really an important role for the occurrence of phenomena called counterintuitive in the hermitian formalism . in @xcite ,",
    "the non - hermitian formalism is sketched .",
    "it allows us to study not only the eigenvalues but also the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath0 in the neighborhood of the eps .    at an ep , two eigenvalues of the hamiltonian",
    "@xmath0 coalesce while the corresponding eigenfunctions differ from one another only by a phase .",
    "such a situation is possible only beyond standard hermitian quantum physics since the eigenfunctions of _ all _ states of a hermitian hamilton operator are orthogonal ( also when their eigenvalues accidentally coalesce ) , while those of a non - hermitian operator are biorthogonal , and the phases of the eigenfunctions relative to one another may change .    in @xcite , analytical and numerical results for the eigenvalues as well as for the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamiltonian are provided ; the influence of eps onto physical observables is discussed ; the appearance of nonlinear terms in the schrdinger equation around eps is considered ; as well as their relation to the phases of the two eigenfunctions relative to one another .",
    "the reduction of the phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions near to an ep means that the environment of scattering wavefunctions with its infinite large number of degrees of freedom plays here an extremely important role for the dynamics of the system since it mediates a coupling of the different states of the system via the environment . as a consequence ,",
    "the wave functions of the two crossing states are mixed ( via the environment ) in a _",
    "parameter range around an ep .",
    "they provide therefore valuable information on the environment not only at one point in the continuum ( which is of measure zero ) , but in a finite parameter range around this point .    according to @xcite , the influence of eps on the dynamical properties of open quantum systems consists in the following : ( i )",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 show a non - analytical behavior ( deviations from fermi s golden rule ) at and in the vicinity of an ep .",
    "width bifurcation occurs due to im(@xmath54 ) , while level repulsion is caused by re(@xmath54 ) ; ( ii ) the phases of the eigenfunctions are not rigid in a finite neighborhood of an ep , and the phase rigidity @xmath20 at the ep .",
    "this dynamical feature allows the environment to influence the system extremely strong at and near to an ep .",
    "these results hold true for open many - body quantum systems the states of which decay into the environment of scattering states , as well for those systems which may absorb particles from the environment .",
    "the main interest of our present study on non - hermitian quantum systems is to find an answer to the question how different eps influence one another and how they are related to a dpt occurring in a physical system .",
    "most studies have to be performed numerically , what is an expression of the well - known fact that the states below and beyond a phase transition are non - analytically connected .",
    "we restrict ourselves , in our paper , to the coherent ( collective ) phenomena induced in an open quantum system by embedding it into a common environment .",
    "these phenomena are very robust",
    ". we will not consider decoherent phenomena in the present paper which arise by coupling the system to a large nonspecific environment , since this coupling does not cause any global new features of the system such as e.g. a dpt , in which we are interested .    in our paper",
    "we consider first the crossing of the eigenvalues of three states analytically and discuss shortly their relevance for physical processes ( sect .",
    "[ more1 ] ) . in the following sect .",
    "[ num3 ] we investigate numerically the influence of a nearby state onto an ep . here",
    ", we consider not only the eigenvalues but also the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian hamilton operator .",
    "the numerical studies are performed for open quantum systems with emission ( _ loss _ ) of particles into the environment ; and also for systems which additionally may absorb particles from the environment ( _ systems with loss and gain _ ) .    in sect .",
    "[ dyn ] of the present paper , we address the problem of the relation of eps to dpts appearing in systems with more than two states .",
    "we are able to justify the restriction of the parameter dependence of the hamiltonian @xmath0 to its non - hermitian part what allows us to receive quickly information on the most important global spectroscopic redistribution processes occurring in open quantum systems , i.e. on the main features of the dpts .",
    "we discuss also numerical results obtained for systems with gain and loss and their relation to those obtained for open quantum systems .",
    "some conclusions on the meaning of eps for the dynamics of open quantum systems are drawn in sect .",
    "[ concl ] . here , we point also to the meaning of the results for phenomena observed in optics , e.g. for the dicke superradiance .",
    "in an open quantum system , the discrete states described by a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath3 , are embedded into the continuum of scattering wavefunctions , which exists always and can not be deleted . due to this fact the discrete states turn into resonance",
    "states the lifetime of which is usually finite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the system which is embedded into the environment , is non - hermitian .",
    "its eigenvalues are complex and provide not only the energies of the states but also their lifetimes ( being inverse proportional to the widths ) .    according to @xcite , the non - hermitian hamiltonian of an open quantum system reads @xcite @xmath24 where the second term is the non - hermitian perturbation ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for the interaction between system and environment ; and @xmath27 is the green function in the environment .",
    "the so - called internal ( first - order ) interaction between two discrete states @xmath17 and @xmath18 is involved in @xmath3 while their external ( second - order ) interaction via the common environment is described by the last term of ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "generally , the coupling matrix elements that determine the external interaction of two states consist of the principal value integral @xmath28 which is real , and the residuum @xmath29 which is imaginary @xcite . here , the @xmath30 and @xmath4 are the eigenfunctions and ( discrete ) eigenvalues , respectively , of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath3 which describes the states in the subspace of discrete states without any interaction of the states via the environment .",

    "the coupling matrix elements ( [ form11 ] ) and ( [ form12 ] ) ( by adding @xmath36 in the first case ) are often simulated by complex values @xmath37 , e.g. @xcite .    in order to study the interaction of two states via the common environment it is best to start from a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 in which @xmath3 in ( [ ham1 ] ) is replaced by a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath38 the eigenvalues of which are complex ( and not discrete as those of @xmath3 ) .",
    "let us consider , for example , the symmetric @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "the selfenergy of the states is assumed to be included into the @xmath48 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath49 allows us to consider the properties of the system near to and at an ep because here the distance between the two states , that coalesce at the ep , relative to one another is much smaller than that relative to the other states of the system .",
    "note that the coupling matrix elements @xmath33 in ( [ form11 ] ) and ( [ form12 ] ) have the dimension of square root of energy while the widths @xmath50 of the individual eigenstates in ( [ form1 ] ) have , of course , the dimension of energy .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath49 are @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 stand for the energy and width , respectively , of the eigenstate @xmath17 . when the energy detuning of the two levels is varied , different behaviors of the eigenvalues ( [ int6 ] )",
    "will be observed which depend on the coupling strength @xmath54 between the states and their environment .",
    "generally , resonance states with nonvanishing widths @xmath53 repel each other in energy according to re@xmath55 while the widths bifurcate according to im@xmath56 .",

    "this situation is called usually avoided crossing of discrete states .",
    "it holds also for narrow resonance states if @xmath57 can not be fulfilled due to the small widths of the two states .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is very well known since many years : the avoided crossing of two discrete states at a certain critical parameter value @xcite means that the two states are exchanged at this point , including their populations ( _ population transfer _ ) .",

    "the present - day high resolution experimental studies require a description of quantum systems by taking into account their embedding into the common continuum of scattering wavefunctions .",
    "this natural environment exists always .",
    "it can be changed by means of external fields , however it can never be deleted .",
    "this basic assumption of the description of open quantum systems , used in the present paper , is proven experimentally , see for example @xcite where it is shown that the interaction between two remote quantum states in semiconductor nanostructures ( quantum point contacts ) is essentially mediated by the continuum .",
    "the coupling of the open quantum system to the environment causes the hamiltonian to be non - hermitian whose eigenvalues @xmath7 are complex , generally .",
    "they provide not only the energies @xmath323 re(@xmath7 ) of the states of the system but also their lifetimes which are inverse proportional to the widths @xmath324 im(@xmath7 ) .",
    "the feedback of the common environment onto the system is involved in the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 as well as in its eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8 . for distant levels ,",
    "the feedback can be neglected , to a good approximation , and the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 passes smoothly into the standard hermitian hamiltonian @xmath3 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling of the system to the common environment of scattering wavefunctions entails some non - trivial mathematical problems .",
    "first of all , there are singular points ( eps ) in the continuum at which the influence of the environment onto the system is extremely large and which therefore influence strongly the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "they cause nonlinear terms in the schrdinger equation and non - rigid phases of the wavefunctions , as shown and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for isolated eps .",
    "different eps influence each other when the ranges of their interaction overlap . here",
    ", a clustering of eps occurs and causes a strong mixing of the wavefunctions of all states in a finite parameter range .",
    "according to the numerical results obtained for three states , the eigenvalues of all the three eigenstates of @xmath0 will _ never cross exactly in one point _ in a physical system .",
    "another important feature is that the environment can put its information on an infinite number of degrees of freedom ( continuum of scattering wavefunctions ) at the ep into the system .",
    "this mechanism is strengthened when the system has more than two states as shown in the present paper .",
    "this mechanism is aimed at the _ stabilization of the system _ by accumulation almost the whole coupling strength between system and environment onto one state ( in the one - channel case ) .",
    "eps may cause therefore dpts with non - analytical connected states on both sides of the dpt .",
    "this statement corresponds to the results obtained qualitatively some years ago @xcite for the appearance of a phase transition in an open quantum system described by a non - hermitian hamilton operator .",
    "the results shown and discussed in the present paper are obtained for open quantum systems described by a schrdinger equation while many experimental results on dpts are known in optics .",
    "an example is the well - known dicke superradiance @xcite and the recent studies on systems with loss and gain that started with @xcite and are continued in many different investigations , e.g. @xcite . in the studies with gain and loss ,",
    "the equivalence of the optical wave equation and the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation @xcite ( which holds true at least under special conditions ) is used to explain the experimental results by means of a phase transition occurring under the influence of eps .",
    "the results of the present paper are expected therefore to be applicable also to the description of optical phenomena .",
    "of special interest is the open question whether the dicke superradiance @xcite known since many years , is a dpt of the type discussed in the present paper . in @xcite , it has been shown that the transition from autler - townes - splitting to electromagnetically induced transparency in optics might be understood as a dpt between two very different processes taking place as a function of the rabi frequency .",
    "other studies on a dpt and eps in optics are performed very recently @xcite .    in any case",

    "the differences between these two types of crossing points consist in the following    1 .",
    "when the crossing point is approached by @xmath266 , two states show the signatures of an ep while the third state is an observer state that , generally , may exchange with one of the other states ; 2 .",
    "when the crossing point is approached by keeping constant @xmath267 and varying another independent parameter , the three states form together a common crossing point , at which all three states participate in the spectroscopic redistribution processes .    in any case",
    ", the spectroscopic redistribution caused by the crossing of three states is a nonlinear process according to ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the results hold for systems with _ loss _ ( all @xmath45 negative ) as well as for systems with _ loss and gain _ ( negative and positive @xmath45 ) .",
    "the detailed study of the crossing point of all three eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ f1 ] ) is of _ formal - mathematical _ interest because it is a point in the continuum and therefore of measure zero .",
    "the geometric phase related to the crossing point of three states is , in any case , different from that of an ep for the crossing of two levels .",
    "this holds true even in the case when the third state is an observer state since this state may exchange with each of the two other states .",
    "the geometric phase depends therefore on the number @xmath268 of crossing states  a result that is difficult to understand for a realistic physical system .",
    "according to the results obtained and discussed in @xcite , any `` third '' state of a realistic physical system will cross or avoid crossing with one of the two states in the neighborhood of the ep whose wavefunction differs however from that of the original state ( because the wavefunctions of both states are mixed with one another near to the ep ) . at each of the crossings ,",
    "the corresponding geometric phase is well defined : it is the geometric phase of an ep related to two states , and differs therefore from the berry phase of a diabolic point by a factor 2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while the properties of isolated eps are studied experimentally as well as theoretically in many papers , the influence of a nearby state onto an ep is not at all investigated , up to now . in this case , the areas of influence of different eps are expected to overlap , and nonlinear terms will appear not only at the eps themselves but , above all , in a _ finite _ vicinity of them .",

( 18 ) in @xcite ) , in the case with overlapping areas of influence of eps , the states are no longer directly related to the original ones .",
    "instead a spectroscopic redistribution , caused by several eps , takes place that is aimed at achieving a _ dynamical stabilization of the system _ by accumulation as much coupling strength between system and environment as possible onto just one specific state ( in the one - channel case ) of the localized system . at the same time",

    "<S> these results hold true for systems that can emit ( `` loss '' ) particles into the environment of scattering wavefunctions as well as for systems which can moreover absorb ( `` gain '' ) particles from the environment . in a parameter range </S>",
    "<S> far from an ep , open quantum systems are described well by a hermitian hamilton operator . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from this parameter range to that near to an ep occurs smoothly .      using the formalism for the description of open quantum systems by means of a non - hermitian hamilton operator </S>",
    "<S> , we study the occurrence of _ dynamical phase transitions _ as well as their relation to the singular exceptional points ( eps ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we provide the results of an analytical study for the eigenvalues of three crossing states . </S>",
    "<S> these crossing points are of measure zero . </S>",
    "<S> then we show numerical results for the influence of a nearby ( `` third '' ) state onto an ep . </S>",
    "<S> since the wavefunctions of the two crossing states are mixed in a finite parameter range around an ep , three states of a physical system will never cross in one point . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the wavefunctions of all three states are mixed in a finite parameter range in which the ranges of the influence of different eps overlap . </S>",
    "<S> we may relate these results to dynamical phase transitions observed recently in different experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> the states on both sides of the phase transition are non - analytically connected . </S>"
