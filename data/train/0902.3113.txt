    "these growth rates @xmath78 computed with the wz method match those of theorem [ thm.6j ] .",
    "indeed , the theorem states that @xmath393 an algebraic calculation confirms that @xmath394 the coefficients of the formal power series @xmath395 are in the number field @xmath396 and the cayley - menger determinant is @xmath397 confirming lemma [ lem.field ] and theorem [ thm.6j ] .",
    "more is actually true .",
    "namely , the sequence @xmath29 generates two new sequences @xmath398 and @xmath399 defined by @xmath400 where @xmath401 .",
    "each of the sequences @xmath402 are factorially divergent .",
    "however , the generating series @xmath403 are @xmath0-functions ( as follows from @xcite ) , and the sequences @xmath404 are of nilsson type , with exponential growth rates @xmath405 .",
    "the asymptotics of each sequence @xmath404 gives rise to finitely many new sequences , and so on .",
    "all those sequences span a finite dimensional vector space , canonically attached to the sequence @xmath29 .",

    "* sec.4 ) .",
    "the second order recursion relation for the plane and the minkowskian examples has lengthy coefficients , and leads to the following sequences @xmath406 and @xmath407    @xmath408    where in the plane case we have @xmath409 and in the minkowskian case we have @xmath410    again in agreement with theorem [ thm.6j ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove the rationality statement of the spin generating function stated in theorem [ thm.gf ] of section [ sec.gf ] .",
    "we will use the _ chromatic evaluation method _ which goes back to @xcite .",

    "therefore , @xmath413 now the crucial observation is that @xmath414 is a polynomial in @xmath181 with integer coefficients , so that @xmath415 is determined once we know the values of @xmath416 for all positive @xmath181 .    for positive @xmath181",
    "there exists an alternative interpretation of @xmath416 as a contraction of tensors . for convenience",
    "we will orient the edges of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath220 be an @xmath181 dimensional vector space and for @xmath417 define the following permutation operators @xmath418 , @xmath419 . at every edge colored @xmath14 we can now speak of the map @xmath420 .",
    "note that the single arcs in the expanded diagram for @xmath2 now correspond to copies of @xmath220 .",
    "the systems of arcs at the vertices indicate how to contract ( compose ) the tensors on the edges .",
    "since all the tensors involved are linear combinations of kronecker deltas we can for each choice of permutations count the number of contracted deltas and this will exactly contribute a term @xmath421 for some @xmath167 since the trace of a delta is simply @xmath181 .",
    "this coincides with the counting and evaluation of loops in every state , since a contracted delta represents a loop .",

    "( of lemma [ lem.binomials ] ) we will calculate @xmath416 by writing out the contraction of tensors into the single contributions of basis elements in the various tensor products .",
    "given a choice of permutations we place tensor products of basis elements @xmath429 on every edge",
    ". such a term contributes @xmath136 if some basis vectors on the same strand are unequal or the same basis element occurs twice in a tensor product corresponding to an edge .",
    "otherwise the contribution is always @xmath430 .    to enumerate the non - zero states in an orderly fashion including the signs of their contributions we proceed in three stages .",
    "first we choose which sets of arcs get labeled by the same base vector . then we assign base vectors to the loops in the curves .",
    "finally we count the number of such labeled states .    in the first stage",
    "we choose the collections of all loops that are labeled by the same base vector . for non - zero states",
    "these collections are necessarily @xmath65-regular subgraphs of @xmath3 , also known as curves .",
    "we will view curves both as sets of the loops they contain and as subgraphs of @xmath3 .",
    "this first stage of the calculation is summarized in the concept of a curve configuration . to every curve @xmath431",
    "we assign the number of distinct base vectors it occurs with .",
    "the curve configuration @xmath432 determines the total coloring of the spin network @xmath4 .",
    "however there may be many curve configurations yielding the same coloring @xmath4 .",
    "note that all states with the same curve configuration contribute the same sign .",
    "this is because of planarity of the ( multiple ) annulus neighborhood of the curve : two loops in the same curve can only cross an even number of times . the common sign is determined by the cyclic ordering of the graph and equals @xmath424 .",
    "this follows directly from a count of the number of intersections of such states .    in the second stage",
    "we choose base vectors and we assign them to the loops such that all the loops with the same base vector constitute exactly one copy of a curve . first we need to choose which base vectors to use",
    ". there are @xmath433 ways to do this .",
    "then we need distribute these over the various curves , assigning @xmath426 base vectors to the curve @xmath140 in no particular order .",
    "there are @xmath434 ways to do this .    in the last stage",
    "we need to count how many arrangements of loops are possible given a curve configuration with base vectors at every loop . as was shown in @xcite",
    "there are @xmath435 ways to do this .",
    "their argument does not make use of planarity but for completeness sake we still reproduce the argument here . if we ignore the labelling by base vectors we will count exactly @xmath436 of the possible states . however if we also choose to ignore the fact that in contributing states the loops can not self intersect , then counting possibly zero states will multiply our count by the same factor @xmath437 . to see why , note that to modify a zero state takes one permutation per curve .    recall that @xmath435 corresponds to a choice of a permutation on the arcs on each side of every vertex in the ribbon graph .",
    "we will show that there are exactly @xmath435 ( possibly zero ) states corresponding to a given curve configuration .",
    "first choose one such a state @xmath102 .",
    "we will show that all others can be reached by inserting a unique permutation at every side of every vertex , with the appropriate modification . at any rate there can not be more than @xmath435 such states , because arcs belonging to one side of a vertex can never be permuted to become part of another side , because that would destroy the curve configuration . even inserting a permutation at the side of a vertex",
    "may destroy the curve configuration , but in this case this can be compensated as follows .",
    "choose an edge adjacent to the chosen side of the vertex and insert the inverse of the part of the permutation swapping arcs belonging to different curves .",
    "exactly because of the fact that this compensating permutation involves only arcs corresponding to unequal curves this does not interfere with any other inserted permutations at the sides of vertices or their compensations .",
    "summarizing , we get @xmath438 and rescaling we get @xmath439    finally setting @xmath440 provides a general formula for spin network evaluation as given in the lemma .    to find a generating function for these evaluations ,",
    "we first introduce a more general generating function .",
    "define the _ curve generating function _ @xmath441 of a graph @xmath3 by @xmath442 where @xmath441 is a function of @xmath443 variables , one for each curve in @xmath3 .",
    "the exponents of these variables encode a curve configuration , and the evaluation @xmath444 of a curve configuration @xmath445 is given by latexmath:[\\[\\la\\mathcal{l}\\ra = ( -1)^{\\i(\\mathcal{l})+|\\mathcal{l}| } (     the spin generating function @xmath106 can be recovered from the curve generating function @xmath441 by substituting @xmath447 , because the color of an edge is the sum of the number of curves ( with multiplicity ) containing that edge .",
    "( of theorem [ thm.gf ] ) our goal now is to write @xmath441 and hence @xmath106 as a rational function . as a first step we note that if we drop the term @xmath424 then we can sum the resulting series using the binomial series and the multinomial theorem to get @xmath448 using this together with the fourier expansion of @xmath424 viewed as a function on the group @xmath449 as @xmath450 we find @xmath451 where @xmath452 and @xmath453 .",
