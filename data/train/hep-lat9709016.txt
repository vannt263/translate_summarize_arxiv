    "high computer costs turned out to be a major problem when performing quenched qcd simulations at smaller lattice spacing @xmath5 . improving the action in order to reduce cut - off effects therefore became an important goal .    while standard gluonic action has discretization errors of @xmath6 , those for wilson fermions are of @xmath7 .",
    "sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite proposed a modified fermion action : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the standard wilson action and @xmath10 if the coefficient @xmath11 of the so - called clover term is chosen appropriately , this action removes all @xmath7 errors from on - shell quantities like hadron masses . a non - perturbative calculation of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath12",
    "was done by the alpha collaboration @xcite .    until now",
    "the qcdsf collaboration has presented results for the light hadron spectrum using the improved action for two values of the coupling , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations have been carried out on ape quadrics computers on lattice sizes up to @xmath15 . in order to allow a more reliable estimate of the chiral limit for @xmath16 we started calculations with a hopping parameter @xmath17 closer to the critical value , @xmath18 , on a lattice of size @xmath0 .    at present",
    "we have evaluated @xmath19 configurations .",
    "we hope for higher statistics , and so the following results should be regarded as preliminary .",
    "we perform the quenched qcd simulations at @xmath20 . to generate a new gauge configuration we use 100 cycles consisting of a single 3-hit metropolis sweep followed by 16 over - relaxation sweeps using the @xmath21 algorithm suggested by creutz @xcite .",
    "we use jacobi smearing @xcite for source and sink .",
    "we chose the number of smearing steps to be @xmath22 and for the smearing hopping parameter we took @xmath23 , for which the radius of the smeared source @xmath24 is about @xmath25 which roughly corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "although we have calculated the propagator for both smeared and unsmeared sink , we will only use the results for smeared sink here .",
    "the simulations are performed for three different hopping parameters , @xmath27 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with clover coefficient @xmath28 chosen according to @xcite . for the matrix inversion we mainly use bicgstab @xcite .",
    "the minimal residue algorithm is used in case bicgstab does not converge . as convergence criterion we chose @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "we found up to 4 configurations per @xmath17 which show an exceptional pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : except ] ) .",
    "they have been excluded from the evaluation .     with",
    "separately plotted exceptional configurations.,height=222 ]    [ fig : except ]",
    "until now we have looked at the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and nucleon masses . we find good plateaus when plotting the effective mass @xmath33 $ ] , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmass_pion ] for the @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : effmass_pion ]    plots of the dimensionless ratio @xmath34 as a function of @xmath35 ( so - called ape plot ) were found to be rather different for improved and wilson fermions at @xmath13 @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ape ] , the results at @xmath16 seem to confirm that the improved results come closer to the physical value than the wilson results .    [ fig : ape ]    to see how masses scale as @xmath36 is changed , it has been suggested @xcite that @xmath37 should be plotted in units of the square - root of the string tension @xmath38 which has cut - off errors of @xmath6 only . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] the ratio @xmath39 is shown as a function of @xmath40 for fixed physical @xmath31 masses with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . to obtain the @xmath32 mass for these values of @xmath44 we extrapolated , or interpolated , @xmath37 using the phenomenological ansatz @xcite @xmath45",
    "on the @xmath0 lattice our current program needs @xmath46 per bicgstab iteration step on a t3e with 128 dec alpha 21164 5/375mhz microprocessors .",
    "simulations done on a 256 node quadrics qh2 need @xmath47 for the same operations on a @xmath15 lattice . comparing the peak performance of both machines ( t3e : 96 gflops / qh2 : 12.8 gflops ) one would expect the t3e to do this job about twice as fast as the qh2 ( although the calculations on the t3e are done in double precision ) .",
    "since the communication overhead in the bicgstab routines on the t3e is less then @xmath48 , this indicates a single processor performance problem .",
    "while lattice gauge theory applications on the qh2 typically reach sustained speeds between @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the peak performance , our t3e code currently runs at about @xmath51 .",
    "this might be explained by two disadvantages of the t3e for this kind of problems : the number of registers and the cache size of the dec 21164 microprocessors .",
    "the stream buffers which improve main memory access make the code about @xmath52 faster .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the cray t3e lc 512 - 512 at the hlrz jlich and the cray t3e lc 128 - 128 at the konrad - zuse - zentrum berlin .",
    "we wish to thank the operating staff for their support .",
