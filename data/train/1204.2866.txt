    "the notion of a quasinormal operator , i.e. , an operator with commuting factors in its polar decomposition , has been introduced by arlen brown in @xcite ( the unbounded case has been undertaken in @xcite ) .",
    "such operators form a bridge between normal and subnormal operators .",
    "quasinormal operators have been found to be useful in many constructions of operator theory , e.g. , when dealing with the question of subnormality ( see @xcite for the general case and @xcite for the case of composition operators ) .    in the present paper",
    "we develop an absolute continuity approach to quasinormality of unbounded operators . on the way we characterize wider classes of operators that seem to be of independent interest .",
    "first we prove that a closed densely defined hilbert space operator @xmath1 is quasinormal if and only if @xmath2 for every vector @xmath3 in the domain @xmath4 of @xmath1 ( the symbol @xmath5 means absolute continuity ) , where @xmath6 is the spectral measure of the modulus @xmath7 of @xmath1 ( see theorem [ chq2 ] ) .",
    "one may ask whether reversing the above absolute continuity implies the quasinormality of @xmath1 .",
    "in general the answer is in the negative ( cf.examples [ nq - ineq ] , [ nq - ineq2 ] and [ nq - ineq3 ] ) .",
    "another question which arises is : assuming more , namely that the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 is bounded by a constant @xmath10 which does not depend on @xmath11 , is it true that @xmath1 is quasinormal ?",
    "we shall prove that the answer is in the affirmative for @xmath12 and in the negative for @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ quasiwkwkw2 ] and section [ exam ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath14 leads to a new class of operators , called weakly quasinormal , which are characterized by means of strong commutant of their moduli ( cf .",
    "theorem [ chq3 ] ) .",
    "let us remark that operators which satisfy the reversed absolute continuity condition can be completely characterized in the language of operator theory ( cf.theorem [ abcon ] ) .",
    "the absolute continuity approach invented in this paper is implemented in the context of weighted shifts on directed trees , cf .",
    "theorem [ wsquasineq ] ( the concept of a weighted shift on a directed tree has been developed in @xcite ) .",
    "this enables us to illustrate the theme of this article by various examples and to show that there is no relationship between the hyponormality class and the classes of operators being considered in this paper ( cf .",
