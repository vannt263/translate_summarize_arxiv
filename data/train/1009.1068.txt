    "modern quantum physics still takes a very lively interest in quantum entanglement .",
    "the entanglement problems are exciting not only from the cognitive point of view , but also as a source of future applications in the field of quantum information theory . in real situations",
    "the system which is able to generate entangled states always interacts with an external environment , and this interaction leads to the losses of entanglement in the systems considered ( for instance , for discussion concerning decoherence processes for a system of two qubits in a lossy cavity see @xcite _ and the references quoted therein _ )",
    ". in particular , if we deal with the cases when the system interacts with a zero - temperature reservoir , one can observe asymptotic entanglement decay ( if there is no interaction between the qubits which produce an entangled state )  meaning that entanglement decays to zero for time @xmath2 . in contradiction ,",
    "interaction with a thermal reservoir is able to shorten significantly that time and entanglement is destroyed in finite time ( such a behaviour is referred to as the _ sudden entanglement death _",
    "it is also known that when the entangled system interacts with squeezed vacuum bath , sudden death of entanglement can be observed @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that under certain conditions it is possible to rebuild entanglement in the system considered after its sudden death ( this is called the sudden entanglement birth @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "such `` sudden '' phenomena can be observed not only for entangling optical systems but also for other models , for instance dealing with spins .",
    "thus , quite recently wang _ et al _ @xcite have discussed _ sudden spin - squeezing death _ effect .",
    "moreover , to avoid decoherence processes several schemes were proposed .",
    "for instance , some of them use decoherence free subspaces ( dfs ) method .",
    "in particular , one can show that the systems interacting with squeezed environment states taken from dfs will never show sudden death phenomena .",
    "contrary , when the interaction involves states that are taken not from dfs the system will loose entanglement in a sudden way ( with possible birth events ) @xcite .    in the present paper we will focus on the decay of initially maximally",
    "entangled state generated via the coherently excited nonlinear coupler ( two nonlinear , kerr - like oscillators interacting nonlinearly with each other ) system .",
    "such couplers can exhibit numerous interesting physical phenomena not only in the domain of quantum information theory but also in other fields of quantum optics ( for the thorough review of the problem concerning nonlinear couplers see for instance review paper @xcite _ and the references quoted therein _",
    ", whereas for problems of nonlinear quantum - optical oscillators in general see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show that we can manipulate the character of the entanglement decay to some extent via the phase of squeezed reservoir in which the system is immersed .",
    "the system we deal with is composed of two nonlinear oscillators labelled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and characterised by the nonlinearity constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the oscillators are described by the hamiltonian expressed by the bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the following form @xmath7 , where the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be identified as third order susceptibilities of the optical nonlinear media  we can refer to our oscillators as `` kerr - like '' ones . such nonlinear systems can be a source of not only entangled states but also other relevant states commonly discussed in the papers devoted to the quantum optics problems .",
    "for instance , miranowicz _ at al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that kerr - like oscillator can be a source of discrete superpositions of arbitrary number of coherent states ( so - called _",
    "schrdinger cat_-like or _ kitten _ states ) .",
    "the oscillators interact with each other by an nonlinear coupling of the strength @xmath8  the hamiltonian corresponding to this interaction can be written as : @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , one of the oscillators ( @xmath3 ) is externally driven by a coherent field .",
    "the intensity of this linear interaction with the field is equal to @xmath10 and the hamiltonian corresponding to this process is @xmath11 .",
    "while the system is not subjected to the interactions with any kind of external environment it can be treated as a _ quantum scissors device _ under some assumptions .",
    "the number of two - mode states engaged in the dynamics can be substantially truncated as both internal ( characterised via @xmath8 ) and external ( described by @xmath10 ) interactions are small if compared with nonlinearity parameters @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , as explained in @xcite , the number of two - mode states effectively engaged in the system s dynamics is drastically reduced .",
    "the fidelity between such truncated state @xmath13 and a two - mode state @xmath14 is almost equal to unity with the accuracy @xmath15 .",
    "we show this fact in fig.1 where the fidelity is plotted for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the numerical calculations were performed in the @xmath19-photon fock basis where @xmath20 two - mode states were involved .",
    "this result enables us to treat our system as a _ nonlinear quantum scissors _ device .",
    "in fact , such behaviour originates from the resonances between the energies of the levels generated by the hamiltonian @xmath21 and the couplings discussed in the model . for further informations concerning linear and",
    "nonlinear quantum scissors devices see for example @xcite _ and the references quoted therein _ or the review papers @xcite .    as mentioned above , the system can beave as _ quantum scissors device _ described in details in @xcite .",
    "this system is able to form bell - like states that are examples of maximally entangled states ( mes ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that for the cases when interactions with external field are absent , we deal practically with qubit - qubit system , whereas when this interaction is present our system should be treated as qutrit - qubit one . in consequence , thanks to the two interactions included in our model , we can generate the bell - like states during the system evolution .",
    "they can be expressed in the following form : @xmath22    unfortunately , if we include the interaction of the system with external reservoir one can expect that such generation process becomes imperfect and we lose the entanglement in our system .",
    "it is so because the dynamics of the system can not be restricted to the two - mode states which are engaged in @xmath23 any more .",
    "the interactions with reservoir cause that the other two - mode states ( the states with lower energy ) can be populated and therefore , the system as a whole can not be treated as a qutrit - qubit one . moreover , due to the interactions with external field ( @xmath10 ) also the states with higher energy are populated , but to a lower extent , as this interaction is small ( in comparison to @xmath12 value ) .",
    "the weakness of this interaction is a necessary condition for the application of the _ nonlinear scissors _ mechanism . in further considerations we shall concentrate on the initially populated subspace defined by the bell - like state and trace the entanglement within this subspace . in such a way we are not interested in the entanglement defined for the whole system that can be produced during the interaction time , but in the previously occupied @xmath1 subsystem entanglement .    in further considerations",
    "we shall show that thanks to the proper choice of the external bath parameters we are able to influence both : degree and character of the entanglement decay , leading to various interesting phenomena .",
    "thus , in the present paper we shall concentrate on the squeezed vacuum state reservoir and on the influence of the squeezing parameters on the entanglement decay processes .    to describe the evolution of the system influenced by a broadband squeezed vacuum",
    "we shall apply master equation approach for the reduced density matrix of the system . including the standard _ rotating wave _ and _ markov _ approximations we derive the master equation in the following form , analogously as in @xcite : @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\sum\\limits_{j = a",

    "if we assume that @xmath35 we deal with usual thermal bath characterized by the mean number of photons equal to @xmath36 in the modes @xmath32 .",
    "however , if we look at the form of eq.(8 ) the strength of the squeezing can be characterised by the value of @xmath36 as well ( and we shall use it in further considerations ) .",
    "as already pointed , the system populated under the interactions with external environment is more dimensional that considered at the beginning of the evolution ( @xmath1 system ) .",
    "anyway , we are interested in the dynamics within the subsystem which was occupied before the interactions were included .",
    "therefore , to discuss the entanglement decay we extract @xmath1 subspace occupied initially from the whole two - mode subspace which is involved in the system s dynamics , using the truncation procedure . of course , one should keep in mind that entanglement can be temporally transferred to other subspace , different from the subspace defined by the states ( eqns.[eq1]-[eq3 ] ) .",
    "the density matrix for the truncated subspace can be obtained from the full density matrix calculated for @xmath37 .",
    "the truncation procedure is given by the following relation : @xmath38 in this way we trace the evolution of entanglement which , before the interactions with environment , lived exclusively in the @xmath1 space , keeping in mind that some amount of entanglement can be ( and nodoubtly is ) transferred periodically out of this traced subspace .    since",
    "our system is not a simple qubit - qubit one ( for such a model the _ concurrence _",
    "parameter for the entanglement description can be applied ) but qutrit - qubit is considered , for determination of the degree of entanglement in the @xmath1 subspace we use the _ negativity _",
    "parameter @xcite .",
    "it is defined using the eigenvalues ( @xmath39 ) of the partial transpose , with respect to the smaller - dimensional subsystem , of the truncated system s density matrix ( @xmath40 ) as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the smallest of the eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix of the system described .",
    "negativity was proved to be an entanglement monotone @xcite and as such it can be used as a good measure of entanglement .",
    "it takes a value of 1 for the mes states ( for the case discussed here  bell - like states ) and for separable ones it is equal to zero . using such an entanglement measure we are able to determine the degree of entanglement in the whole system considered .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , the system under consideration can be a source of maximally entangled states @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( _ see _ eqns.([eq1 ]  [ eq3 ] ) ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that although in the paper @xcite the entanglement dynamics in thermal and zero - temperature reservoirs has already been presented , however for the entanglement within two - qubit subspace , in contrast to the situation dealt with here , where the @xmath1 system is considered .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the entanglement sudden death and rebirth phenomena within the @xmath46 subsystems considered were caused by the interaction of this subsystem with the third entangled state @xmath45 from which the entanglement can be periodically transferred to the two qubit subsystem ( formed by @xmath43 and @xmath44 states ) .",
    "we should point out that in the present paper we deal with entanglement generated in the qutrit - qubit ( @xmath1 ) system and we shall concentrate on the influence of squeezed reservoir on the entanglement decay process .    for the system considered here we assume that the mes ( bell - like state @xmath45 ) is generated initially and next , the external squeezed bath starts to influence the system .",
    "since we are interested in the character of negativity decay when the system interacts with squeezed reservoir and especially , we want to check whether the squeezed reservoir can influence this decay in any way by examining the time - evolution of the negativity for various values of the parameters describing the reservoir squeezed field .",
    "as shown in our previous paper @xcite , if the bell state interacts with zero - temperature reservoir and there is no interaction between the system s parts forming entangled state , the entanglement decays asymptotically i.e. for @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "however , if we deal with the thermal reservoir , the sudden death of entanglement phenomenon occurs in the system ( entanglement decays to zero in a finite time ) . for the system interacting with the broadband squeezed vacuum bath ( the case discussed here )",
    "we see that the moment of time of the last sudden death of entanglement phenomenon occurrence can depend on the squeezing parameters .",
    "in particular , for the system discussed here we assume that the bath is squeezed in the same mode as that in which the coupler is externally pumped . at first , looking at fig.2 we can see the influence of the squeezing parameter @xmath49 on final disentanglement time @xmath50 for constant squeezed vacuum phase @xmath34 .",
    "similarly as for the case when we deal with not squeezed and zero - temperature bath ( @xmath51 ) the time @xmath50 reaches high values  we can conclude that we obtain almost an asymptotic decay of entanglement .",
    "however , higher values of @xmath49 make the sudden death of entanglement visible as finite values of time @xmath50 become considerably smaller .",
    "shortening of @xmath50 can be observed for both cases considered here ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "moreover , for these two cases the value of @xmath50 decreases continuously and tends asymptotically to its final value ( _ see _ fig.2 ) .",
    "however , comparing the two dependences of @xmath50 on @xmath49 , we can easily identify some values of @xmath49 for which @xmath50 is considerably different for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it means that by changing the value of @xmath34 we may prevent the system from rebuilding the entanglement despite the fact that there is still an interaction between both oscillators and @xmath10 ( strength of the interaction with external pumping field ) is large enough to produce another entanglement birth .    for further considerations we will choose non - zero values for @xmath49 and shall concentrate on the influence of the phase @xmath34 on the entanglement decay dynamics .",
    "in particular , we shall find such a value of @xmath49 for which we can observe the noticeable changes in the values of @xmath50 as @xmath34 varies form @xmath55 to @xmath56 , concentrating in further considerations on the influence of the squeezed reservoir properties on rebuilding of the entanglement in the system .",
    "for instance , if we neglect mutual interaction between two oscillators ( @xmath57 ) , assume weak external pumping ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( squeezed bath in one mode ) sudden death of entanglement appears .",
    "we see ( fig.3 ) that when the phase of squeezing is equal to zero ( or @xmath56 ) the entanglement death appears slightly later than for the non - squeezed , thermal field case ( @xmath61 , @xmath59 ) . however ,",
    "if we additionally assume that apart from the absence of coupling between the oscillators the external coherent field is also cut off , the changes are practically unnoticeable and the result is practically identical to that of thermal reservoir case .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that any larger changes of the moment of time when the entanglement death appears are noticeable when the squeezing is present in the same mode of the reservoir modes that is externally pumped .",
    "at this point we assume that two oscillators interact with each other ( _ i.e. _ @xmath62 ) and we will focus on the differences in the entanglement decay due to the interactions with broadband squeezed vacuum , in comparison to the standard thermal reservoir . as shown in @xcite",
    "the oscillations of entanglement appear in the system and for the thermal reservoir case besides the regular oscillations ( characteristic for zero - temperature environment ) it is possible to observe sequences of the sudden deaths and entanglement revivals .",
    "but what is more interesting , for the case of the squeezed external bath the phase of the squeezed reservoir mode can influence the time after which the final disentanglement is obtained and also influences the amount of the entanglement rebuilt in the system .",
    "in particular , we have noticed that by changing the phase of the squeezed reservoir mode we can qualitatively change the decay of negativity .",
    "it is seen for the whole range of @xmath63 ( for all cases : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) . in particular , in fig.4(a ",
    "c ) we plotted the time after which the final entanglement death occurs ( @xmath50 ) as a function of squeezed bath phase @xmath34 showing that one additional rebuilt maximum in negativity versus time appears for some range of squeezed reservoir phases @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( a similar feature can be observed for the thermal reservoir case , although there @xcite the mean number of photons and external coupling strength dependences were discussed instead of phase dependence ) .",
    "for the system discussed here we can observe a significant shortening ( @xmath69 ) of total disentanglement time @xmath50 for @xmath66 ( fig.4b ) and shortening by @xmath70 for both @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( see figs.4a and 4c ) . in fig.2 we can see that this shortening ( when we compare the cases for @xmath54 and @xmath71 ) varies from @xmath72 to @xmath73 for various values of squeezing parameter @xmath49 .",
    "our considerations concern one of these @xmath49 values that cause the maximal @xmath50 shortening .",
    "moreover , it is seen that for all cases shown in fig.4a ",
    "c for some values of @xmath34 we observe one entanglement rebirth event less as a result of the influence of the squeezing phase on the entanglement dynamics .",
    "this change is of sudden character and indicates that we have some sort of the `` phase transition '' within the system discussed . for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( fig.4a and fig.4c ) we can see that the interaction of the system with the squeezed vacuum ( for @xmath74 ) can shorten the time @xmath50 as we compare it with the case when ordinary thermal bath is considered .",
    "however this shortening is less pronounced  see the inset . beyond this range even though @xmath10 is not strong enough to produce another entanglement rebirth , the interactions with the squeezed bath lead to the appearance of additional negativity re - occurrence and hence , to a significant ( @xmath70 ) lengthen of @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath66 ( fig.4b ) the changes of @xmath34 are of the  phase transition  character again ( as for the previous cases ) , but for this case one can observe vanishing of the last negativity maximum and consequently , a rapid shortening of @xmath50 time .",
    "the character of this  transition  is related to the fact that if the squeezing phase @xmath34 changes its value the terms in the master equation proportional to the @xmath75 add or subtract each other . in consequence , the populations and coherences in the system considered ( and corresponding to them matrix elements of @xmath76 ) will be affected as well .",
    "due to the fact that the definition of the _ negativity _ involves _ max _ function , changes in the matrix elements of @xmath76 lead to the rapid changes ( zeroing ) in the _",
    "negativity_. a similar behaviour was discussed in @xcite where the squeezing phase dependence of the decoherence rate was considered for the atomic system located inside the cavity .",
    "thus , we can see that the phase of squeezed reservoir can influence not only the time of entanglement death but also can change the system s ability to rebuild the entanglement .",
    "especially , we can see that even though the value of @xmath10 is enough to cause the entanglement rebuild , the appropriately chosen phase @xmath34 may prevent the last entanglement reconstruction .",
    "one more aspect that can be influenced by the squeezed reservoir state phase @xmath34 is the amount of entanglement rebuild in the system during the last entanglement rebirth phenomenon observed .",
    "fig.5 shows the dependence of the maximal value of the last @xmath77 and last but one negativity maximum @xmath78 on the phase @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , to the case discussed earlier ( fig.4 ) we can observe some kind of  phase transition  - like behaviour  sudden changes of the maximal value of the last negativity reconstruction @xmath77 for some values of @xmath34 ( inset in fig.5 ) when the amplitude of the last negativity maximum is equal to zero .",
    "one should note that for the same range of @xmath34 we observe significant shortening of the time @xmath50 as well .",
    "additionally , we can see from fig.5 that the interaction with the squeezed bath can reduce the amount of entanglement preserved in the system .",
    "this reduction depends on the value of @xmath64  for @xmath64 and @xmath65 it is about @xmath79 , while for @xmath66 even @xmath80 .    for the case of smaller squeezing parameter ( @xmath81 , mode b",
    "is not squeezed ) we can only observe the regular changes in the time after which entanglement disappears and we do not see any `` phase transitions '' in the system ( fig.6 ) .",
    "the shortening of the death time is only by about @xmath82 and all the rebuild maxima of the negativity ",
    "time dependence are present for all squeezed reservoir phases  see fig.6 .",
    "it confirms the earlier conclusion about the @xmath50 dependence on the squeezing parameter @xmath49 visible at fig.2 .",
    "it should be also mentioned that for this case the changes in value of the last rebuilt maximum are of the same character as for the case of stronger squeezing , but smaller in percent .",
    "as we look at the time - evolution of both : negativity and populations of individual states , the question arises if the reservoir effects and population transfer could influence considerably the negativity evolution .",
    "the answer can be obtained for instance , from analysis of the trace of the density matrix @xmath83 corresponding to the @xmath1 subsystem considered .",
    "thus , fig.7 shows the plots of the negativities and the trace of @xmath83 for @xmath71 and @xmath56 .",
    "we see that for both values of @xmath34 the whole system that was initially populated in this subspace ( @xmath84 for t=0 ) starts to populate other states  @xmath85 decreases and is practically identical for both values of @xmath34 .",
    "the character of this decay depends on the value of the negativity for a given moment of time .",
    "in particular , the decay rate increases when the negativity goes to zero , whereas it slows down as the negativity reaches its maximum ( this effect is visible in particular for the first negativity reconstruction ) .",
    "however those effects do not play crucial role , especially for longer times .",
    "this means that the population leakage can effect the entanglement dynamics to some extend .",
    "we have analysed the influence of squeezed reservoir on the entanglement decay for a nonlinear system initially prepared in a maximally entangled state ( one of the bell - like state ) .",
    "such a state determines some subspace of the states that can be treated as qutrit - qubit system and we have concentrated on it . obviously , when the interaction with an external reservoir is included , other states are populated and in that way the whole system is no more a simple qutrit - qubit one , but more dimensional qudits should been considered . anyway , our aim was to trace the evolution of the entanglement within the initially occupied subspace . therefore , we look for the entanglement evolution inside the same qutrit - qubit system , keeping in mind that the other states ( corresponding to the lower energies of the system ) are involved in the dynamics and some loses of the entanglement in the subspace considered are related to the populating of these states . for the case when the oscillators could not interact with each other we could observe only small variations in the values of time @xmath50 when the entanglement disappears completely as a function of the squeezing phase .",
    "moreover , this value does not differs considerably from that for the model involving standard thermal reservoir .",
    "however , the more pronounced changes become visible when both the interactions ( external characterised by @xmath10 and internal characterised by @xmath8 ) are present . from the discussion of a similar model @xcite ( where the thermal bath was considered ) we expect oscillations of negativity , but their character depends on the squeezed reservoir properties . in particular",
    ", we have shown that shortening of the death time for the parameters used , by about @xmath86 to @xmath87 of its original value can be obtained while @xmath63 changes for some range of squeezed reservoir phases .",
    "the changes in this shortening can be of the step character resembling in some sense a `` phase transition '' in the system .",
    "in fact , we observe one entanglement revival less or more , as a result of the interaction with the squeezed bath depending on the phase of squeezing . moreover , some changes in the amplitude of the last negativity maximum due to the squeezing phase variations could be also observed . in consequence , we can reduce the value of the entanglement revival at the end of its life by about @xmath88 to @xmath89 of its original value . concluding",
    ", we can say that the squeezing parameters of external bath can influence considerably the entanglement decay dynamics leading to various interesting features .",
