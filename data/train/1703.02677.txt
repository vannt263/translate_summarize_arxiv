    "the neutrino - nucleus(@xmath0-a ) cross sections are important input to the systematics of analysing @xmath0 oscillation experiments .",
    "the measured events are a convolution of energy - dependent neutrino flux and @xmath0-a cross section . for precise measurements ,",
    "there are two challenging tasks , ( i ) good knowledge of neutrino fluxes and ( ii ) well understood nuclear medium effects(nme ) in the entire region of neutrino energy spectrum . in this presentation",
    ", we have considered the following neutrino interactions : @xmath1 on nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "similar reactions take place with @xmath2 .",
    "it is estimated that due to nme the cross sections have an overall uncertainty of 20 - 25@xmath3@xcite .",
    "we present here a short review of current understanding of @xmath4 cross section .",
    "most of the present monte carlo generators use relativistic fermi gas model(fgm ) given by smith and moniz@xcite to analyse the experimental results on @xmath4 cross section .",
    "however , other variants of fgm like the model used by aligarh  @xcite and valencia  @xcite groups , where local fgm with long range correlations of the particle - hole excitations in the nuclear medium were included or the calculations where nucleon spectral functions are used to include the initial state interactions@xcite .",
    "first high statistics experimental results from miniboone  @xcite , and later k2k@xcite and minos@xcite could not be explained by using smith and moniz@xcite model of qe reactions using the standard values of weak vectors and axial vector form factors .",
    "these experiments required a value of @xmath5 which was much larger than the world average value of 1.026gev .",
    "it was shown by martini et al.@xcite and later nieves et al.@xcite , the importance of two particle - two hole(2p-2h ) contribution(which is basically multi - nucleon correlation effect ) .",
    "the inclusion of 2p-2h to the ccqe results obtained using fgm with rpa effect gives satisfactory explanation of the data with @xmath6 gev which are consistent with the values reported from nomad@xcite and minerva@xcite that corresponds to high @xmath0 energies .",
    "it is likely that these 2p-2h contributions are important in the region of low energies and are small at higher energies .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1(left ) . recently",
    "stowell et al.@xcite compared the minerva ccqe data with two different mc generators neut and nuwro , the results of which have been shown in fig.[fig1](mid and right ) .",
    "it may be seen that the data and the results from the mc generators are not in agreement particularly in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "therefore , better theoretical models to understand nme in @xmath0-a scattering process for analysing ccqe events are needed .",

    "the experimental data on weak pion production in @xmath0-a scattering in the experiments performed at miniboone , sciboone and more recently from miner@xmath0a collaboration have highlighted the inadequacy of our present understanding of nuclear medium and final state interaction effects .",
    "in addition there is lack of consensus in the theoretical modeling of basic reaction mechanism of @xmath12 induced pion production from free nucleon , specially concerning the role of background terms and higher resonances . by including the contribution of background terms and higher resonances along with the dominant @xmath13 resonance ,",
    "aligarh group  @xcite has studied weak charged and neutral current induced single pion production from nucleons and fitted the reanalysed anl and bnl data  @xcite , and the results are shown in fig.[fig2](left ) .",
    "it was concluded that the best description of the reanalyzed experimental data of anl and bnl experiments is obtained when we take @xmath14=1.0 and @xmath5=1.026gev for n@xmath15 axial vector transition current form factor @xmath16 . in an another work by valencia group",
    "@xcite , implementing unitarity using watson s theorem and applying it to fit old and reanalysed anl and bnl data , the best fit was found with @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , and @xmath5=@xmath19gev .    in the case of single @xmath11 production from nuclear targets , the dominant contribution from the @xmath13 resonance",
    "is suppressed due to modifications of mass and width of the @xmath13 propagator in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the produced pions undergo final state interaction(fsi ) with the residual nucleus which further reduces the pion production . in fig.[fig2](mid ) , the results for cc1@xmath11 production in @xmath9 obtained by different theoretical groups are shown along with the miner@xmath0a data  @xcite .",
    "recently mcgivern et al.@xcite have published miner@xmath0a data of cc1@xmath11 production and compared the results with different theoretical approach incorporated in mc generators(fig.[fig2 ] right ) .",
    "it may be clearly observed that there is a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental results which need further study .",

    "the details may be seen at ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=453,height=453 ]    there is another mode of pion production from nuclear target known as coherent pion production where a nucleus after the interaction remains in the ground state and all the energy is transferred to the outgoing pion .",
    "the work by the aligarh group@xcite and the valencia group  @xcite have shown that the contribution from coherent pion production is highly suppressed due to nme and is 2 - 3@xmath3 of the total pion production .",
    "besides 1@xmath11 production there can be 2@xmath11 or multipion production for which details can be found in ref .",
    "there is no sharp kinetic region to distinguish the onset of the dis region from the resonance region but the region @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 gev@xmath22 is considered to be dis region . at high energy and @xmath7 ,",
    "the inclusive dis cross sections are usually expressed in terms of the structure functions which are derived in terms of quark pdfs using the methods of perturbative qcd .",
    "these structure functions are experimentally determined from dis experiments on nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "the observation of emc effect has led to the presence of strong nme in dis region .",
    "phenomenologically nme on quark pdfs and nucleon sf have been determined by many groups  @xcite .",
    "there is considerable theoretical work on studying nme in structure functions  @xcite . recently a comparative study of nme in @xmath23 and @xmath24 has been done by aligarh group  @xcite and kulagin and petti  @xcite .",
    "the aligarh group has studied nme in structure functions for moderate as well as heavy nuclear targets .",
    "we construct a relativistic nucleon spectral function for a nucleon in an interacting fermi sea within a field theoretical formalism which uses nucleon propagators in the nucleus .",
    "the spectral function takes into account binding energy , fermi motion and nucleon correlations .",
    "other effects like target mass correction , next to leading order correction , pion and rho mesons cloud contributions , shadowing and antishadowing corrections are also included in numerical calculations of structure functions . in fig.[dis ] , we show the curves for @xmath25 obtained using the spectral function only , also including the mesonic contribution , and finally using the full model which also includes shadowing .",
    "the use of spectral function leads to a reduction in @xmath23 as well as in @xmath24 nuclear structure functions as compared to the free nucleon case .",
    "the inclusion of mesonic contributions from pion and rho mesons leads to an enhancement in these structure functions at low and mid values of @xmath26 .",

    "the other inelastic processes like @xmath35 , @xmath30 and ap production have also been discussed briefly . the strange particles are produced by both @xmath33 and @xmath34 processes . at the neutrino energies of @xmath361gev it is the single hyperon(by @xmath37 ) or single kaon(@xmath38 ) that are produced by @xmath34 reaction mechanism while @xmath30 meson and associated production of kaon are induced by the @xmath39 weak currents . the reaction cross sections are smaller than the pion production due to cabibbo suppression in @xmath34 process .",
    "it has been shown by aligarh group  @xcite that for the precise determination of neutrino oscillation parameters and to estimate the background for a study of nucleon decay searches , these reactions are important . in fig.[strange ] , we have presented the results for cc induced @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath30 production cross sections .",
