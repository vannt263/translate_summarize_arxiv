    "associations between pulsars and supernova remnants ( snrs ) allow measurements which would not be possible on either population of object alone . since the center of an snr marks the presumed pulsar birth - site",
    ", the pulsar s characteristic age , combined with the offset of the pulsar from the center of the snr , lets us estimate the pulsar s transverse velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more difficult measurement is to actually measure such a pulsar s proper motion .",
    "the direction of motion can confirm ( or refute ) the association with the snr , while the magnitude of the motion gives an independent estimate of the pulsar s age ( @xcite ) .",
    "psr  is a rapidly spinning ( @xmath6  ms ) radio , x - ray , and @xmath7-ray pulsar , located on the edge of the unusual snr  ctb  80 ( g69.0 + 2.7 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while  is spinning only slightly slower than the crab pulsar , its low period derivative implies a much larger characteristic age , @xmath8 kyr , and a much lower surface magnetic field , @xmath9  g ( @xcite ) .    the distance to the pulsar of @xmath10  kpc , as estimated from its dispersion measure , is consistent with the snr s distance of 2  kpc as measured with hi  absorption ( @xcite ) , suggesting that the two sources are physically associated .",
    "however , this system appears quite different from more typical pulsar / snr associations , in which a young ( @xmath11  kyr ) pulsar sits near the center of an approximately circular shell .",
    "this difference can be understood if one invokes an evolutionary scenario in which the pulsar was originally interior to the snr , but as a result of its high space velocity has caught up with and begun to penetrate its snr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar s relativistic wind then interacts with the snr shell , re - energizing and distorting it ( @xcite ) .",
    "this sequence can explain both the strange appearance of  and the large age for  compared to most pulsar / snr associations .",
    "while this evolutionary picture is aesthetically pleasing , it is imperative that it be verified by observations .",
    "specifically , the model proposed for  can be tested by measurement of the proper motion of psr  .",
    "if the two sources are associated , then the pulsar should be moving away from the center of the snr , as defined by the shell seen in infra - red and hi  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the separation between the pulsar and the shell s center , when combined with the pulsar s characteristic age , lets us predict a proper motion for the pulsar of @xmath12  mas  yr@xmath1 at a position angle ( pa ) @xmath13 ( north through east ) , independent of the distance to the system .",
    "psr  shows significant timing noise , which prevents measurement of its proper motion through time - of - arrival analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , only via interferometric measurements can this prediction be tested . in this _ letter _ , we report on measurements of the motion of psr  over an 11-year baseline . in  [ sec_obs ] we describe our observations , while in  [ sec_meas ] we explain the method used to make our measurements and present our results . in  [ sec_disc ] we discuss the implications of these results for the pulsar and snr .",
    "observations of psr  were made with the very large array ( vla ) at epochs 1989.04 , 1991.55 , 1993.02 and 2000.90 .",
    "each observation was eight hours in duration and used the vla s a configuration . in the 1989 , 1991 , and 1993 observations ,",
    "data were recorded at two simultaneous frequencies , 1385 & 1652 mhz , within the 20-cm band .",
    "each frequency consisted of 15 channels spread across a 23.5 mhz bandwidth with a sampling time of 10  seconds , resulting in a useable field - of - view of radius @xmath14 centered on the pulsar . for the 2000-epoch observations",
    ", we also incorporated data from the pie town antenna of the vlba , which doubled the resolution of the array primarily in one dimension .",
    "the observations for that epoch were conducted at 1385 & 1516 mhz , and consisted of 15 channels across a 12.5 mhz bandwidth with 5-sec sampling , again resulting in a 10-arcmin field - of - view .",
    "the flux density scale of our observations was determined using observations of 3c  286 , while the time - varying gains for each antenna were measured using regular observations of pks  b1923 + 210 or txs  2013 + 370 .",
    "after standard editing and calibration , we produced images of the pulsar field for each epoch and frequency , using multi - frequency synthesis to mitigate bandwidth smearing , and discarding all baselines shorter than 10  km ( corresponding to spatial scales larger than @xmath15 ) . by removing these shorter baselines , we ensured that emission from snr  and from the compact wind - driven nebula surrounding the pulsar were not detected .",
    "the only emission seen in our images was the pulsar itself , the `` hot - spot '' seen immediately adjacent ( @xcite ) , and various other point sources spread throughout the field .",
    "we have identified seven such sources within @xmath16 of the pulsar , as listed in table  [ tab_pos ] .",
    "after deconvolving each image using the clean algorithm , we applied a gaussian fit to the pulsar and to each of these seven sources to measure their position and extent at each epoch and frequency .",
    "in order to accurately measure the pulsar proper motion , we adopted six of the field sources as reference sources , reserving the nearest source to the pulsar ( source  1 in table  [ tab_pos ] ) as a check on our measurements .",
    "the reference sources are approximately evenly distributed throughout the field .",
    "the quality of each source as an astrometric reference was determined by measuring the vector separation between all possible pairs of sources , and then verifying that no source showed trends or significant changes in the magnitude and direction of these vectors .",
    "we also verified that in all cases the dimensions of the fitted gaussian matched those of the synthesized beam , confirming that scatter broadening and bandwidth smearing ( in the case of background sources ) or scintillation ( in the case of the pulsar ) were not affecting our positional determinations .",
    "the ionosphere can potentially distort the measured positions , producing a frequency - dependent angular displacement @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the angular separation between a source and the field center , @xmath19 is the observing wavelength , and @xmath20 is a constant . by measuring @xmath18 for each source and each frequency",
    ", we found that @xmath20 had a value consistent with zero , demonstrating that any ionospheric effects were dominated by other uncertanties in our measurements .",
    "mcgary  ( 2001 ) used the vla to measure pulsar proper motions an order of magnitude smaller than that expected here , and found a variety of other ways in which the positions of reference sources can be distorted , including relativistic effects due to the earth s motion , errors introduced by the vla correlator and additional empirical corrections which had no simple explanation . at the lower precision required here , we have accounted for all these effects simply by measuring the scatter in the position of each reference source between epochs .",
    "we began by determining the vector distances between all possible pairings of the six reference sources .",
    "the standard deviations of the components of each vector in right ascension and declination were computed for the four epochs ; these were taken as the uncertainty for a particular pairing .",
    "this uncertainty was then decomposed between the two sources in that pair , the relative contributions of the two sources to the joint error being weighted inversely by each source s signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we were thus able to derive an uncertainty in the position of each source for each pairing ; these uncertainties were averaged over the five possible pairings to determine the best measurement of the true uncertainty in each coordinate for each source . this analysis was performed separately for observations at 1385  mhz and at 1516/1652  mhz . a mean reference position for each epoch and frequency",
    "was then determined by averaging together the positions of the six reference sources , weighting the contribution from each source inversely by its distance from the field center .",
    "the separation between the pulsar s position and this mean reference position was then measured for each epoch and frequency , combining in quadrature the calculated uncertainties in the pulsar position with those determined for the reference position .",
    "the results of these measurements are plotted in figure  [ fig_motion ] , and show a clear motion of the pulsar to the south - west .",
    "the flux density of the pulsar was higher during the 1993 observations than at other epochs , resulting in smaller uncertainties in the pulsar position for this measurement .",
    "note that the position of the pulsar listed in table  [ tab_pos ] is consistent with previous determinations ( @xcite ) , but with larger errors due to the systematic errors discussed above .",
    "such uncertainties in the absolute astrometry do not affect our proper motion measurement , which has been determined based on astrometry relative to nearby background sources .",
    "as an independent test of our approach , we have similarly measured the proper motion for source  1 . as is shown in figure  [ fig_motion ] ,",
    "no change in position is seen for this source , demonstrating that the motion measured for the pulsar is real and that the uncertainties have been realistically assessed .    by applying a weighted least squares fit to the pulsar s position at each epoch",
    ", we find a proper motion at 1385  mhz of @xmath21  mas  yr@xmath1 , at pa  @xmath22 , and at 1516/1652  mhz of @xmath23  mas  yr@xmath1 at pa  @xmath24 .",
    "these two measurements are consistent with each other within their uncertainties . after taking into account apparent motion of the pulsar at the level of 5  mas  yr@xmath1 due to differential galactic rotation",
    ", the combination of our two measurements yields a motion @xmath25  mas  yr@xmath1 at pa  @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding projected velocity is @xmath27  for a distance @xmath28  kpc .",
    "the transverse velocity we have inferred for psr  is in agreement with the value @xmath29  implied by scintillation in its dynamic spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in figure  [ fig_ctb80 ] the measured position angle of the proper motion agrees closely with the direction predicted if the adjacent `` hot - spot '' is interpreted as a bow - shock driven ahead of the pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "it can also be seen in figure  [ fig_ctb80 ] that the pulsar is clearly traveling directly away from the center of its snr . while this result is not unexpected given the already strong evidence for an association between the pulsar and snr , it is surprising to realize that this is the first time such an effect has actually been observed .",
    "such measurements for other young pulsars in snrs have failed to demonstrate such motion , and have either required specific models of snr and pulsar evolution to maintain the association ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or have caused the association to be abandoned ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the direction in which the pulsar is moving is as predicted , the magnitude of the pulsar s motion is not in agreement with the simplest expectations . by projecting the pulsar s position back by @xmath30  kyr to its inferred birth - site , it can be seen from figure  [ fig_ctb80 ] that if the pulsar was born near the center of its snr , then the pulsar s true age , @xmath31 , must be less than @xmath32 .",
    "we can make an initial estimate of @xmath31 by simply identifying the offset , @xmath33 , of the pulsar from the snr s center .",
    "we estimate from the morphology of the infra - red shell shown in figure  [ fig_ctb80 ] that @xmath34 , so that @xmath35  kyr .",
    "however , a high velocity progenitor and/or asymmetric snr expansion can produce a significant offset between the pulsar birth - site and the geometric center of the snr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the complicated evolutionary history of , it is perhaps overly optimistic to define a precise geometrical center and simply assume the pulsar was born there .",
    "if the birth - site is not at the snr s geometric center , there is no reason to expect the pulsar to be traveling away from this position ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the farther the birth - site from the center of the snr , the less likely the pulsar should be moving in this direction by chance .",
    "we can therefore quantify the uncertainty in the pulsar s birthplace as follows .",
    "we assume that for a given angular separation @xmath36 from the snr s geometric center , it is equally likely that the pulsar was born at any position on a circle concentric with the snr and of radius @xmath36 .",
    "thus , for a particular value of @xmath36 , we can compute the fraction of possible birth - sites which are consistent with the pulsar s direction of proper motion , pa  @xmath26 . by considering the full range of values @xmath37",
    ", we can build up a probability distribution of possible pulsar ages , from the integral of which we can determine the @xmath38 confidence limits on @xmath36 . using this approach , we find that the pulsar was born within @xmath39 of the snr s center , and that the age implied by our proper motion measurement is @xmath40  kyr .",
    "these estimates are independent of the distance to the system and on the site of the supernova explosion ; they depend only on the assumptions that an approximate geometric center can be defined for the snr , and that the pulsar is moving away from its birthplace .",
    "the age we have derived is consisent with the estimate of 77  kyr , derived from the expansion velocity of the hi  shell coincident with the snr ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not surprising that this system s true age is less than the pulsar s characteristic age . for a pulsar of constant moment of inertia and magnetic dipole moment , it is straightforward to show that ( @xcite ) : @xmath41 , \\label{eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the pulsar s `` braking index '' and @xmath43 is its initial spin - period . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , equation  ( [ eqn ] ) reduces to @xmath46 , but in general neither such condition will be satisfied . while @xmath42 has not been measured for psr  , we find @xmath47 for the five pulsars which have had their braking indices measured ( @xcite and references therein ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the range in @xmath31 determined above implies @xmath48  ms for psr  , while for @xmath49 we find @xmath50  ms . combining these estimates ,",
    "we find the initial period most likely falls in the range @xmath5  ms . again , this estimate does not depend on the assumed distance to the source .    as listed in table  [ psr_period ] , psr  joins a rapidly growing list of pulsars whose initial periods have been determined from their associations with either snrs or historical supernovae . while these measurements span a reasonable range of initial periods , the data provide good evidence that radio pulsars are born as rapid rotators , with no evidence for a population of longer initial periods as has been sometimes proposed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is becoming abundantly clear that @xmath32 can be an unreliable estimator of a young pulsar s age , with corresponding implications for associations with snrs , pulsar velocities , and models for neutron star cooling .",
    "with many new pulsar / snr associations now being identified at both radio and x - ray wavelengths , a statistically useful sample of pulsar initial spin periods should soon emerge .",
