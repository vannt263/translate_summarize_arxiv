    ", psr  b1821@xmath024 is believed to be the most energetic msp up to date .",
    "psr  b1821@xmath024 has detectable multi - wavelength emission from radio to @xmath1-ray band .",
    "it was the first msp with x - ray pulsed emission clearly detected by _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pulsed emission of psr  b1821@xmath024 has also been observed by other x - ray telescopes . at the radio band ,",
    "psr  b1821@xmath024 was the first msp which had been observed to go through a microglitch in 2001 march @xcite .",
    "this could be a useful hint to the conventional glitch theory which should work for both young and old millisecond pulsars .",
    "similar to other msps ( e.g. , psr j0218@xmath74232 , psr b1937@xmath721 or b1957@xmath720 ) , psr  b1821@xmath024 has radio giant pulses with a steep spectral index and a high degree of polarization , the phase positions of these giant pulses are overlapped with its x - ray pulses @xcite . in addition , @xcite first presented a 720 - 2400 mhz phase - resolved radio measurements including polarization angle curve , spectral indices and giant pulses .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath1-ray , x - ray and radio pulse profiles with good signal - to - noise ratio for psr  b1821@xmath024 , which challenge the pulsar caustic models @xcite .",
    "such models can not self - consistently explain the complexity of its pulse profiles .",
    "psr  b1821@xmath024 was detected to have strongly linearly polarized radio emission . with the coherently dedispersed polarization data , @xcite used the rotating vector model ( rvm ) to fit its polarization curve , and the inclination angle @xmath8 as well as the impact angle @xmath9 are derived , note that the viewing angle is @xmath10 .    up to date , the multi - wavelength pulse profiles of psr  b1821@xmath024 have not been well simulated by current emission models due to its unprecedent complexity .",
    "@xcite speculated that psr  b1821@xmath024 have plausible phase - aligned radio , x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulse profiles which had not been precisely simulated .",
    "furthermore , this pulsar does not have all peaks occurring at the same phase , according to the observed results presented by @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the three - dimension annular gap model is used to study multi - wavelength ( @xmath1-ray , x - ray and radio ) pulse profiles for psr  b1821@xmath024 . in section 2",
    ", we will briefly introduce the definition of annular gap and core gap ; the multi - wavelength pulse profiles for psr  b1821@xmath024 will be simulated , and the altitudes of multi - wavelength emission will also be identified .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are shown in section 3 and section 4 , respectively .",
    "the polar cap region of a pulsar can be divided into the annular gap and core gap regions @xcite . in the vicinity of the light cylinder",
    ", charged particles could not co - rotate with the magnetosphere and they escaped .",
    "the pulsar must output the particles to compensate its loss .",
    "therefore , a huge acceleration electric field ( @xmath11 ) with opposite signs are generated in both annular gap and core gap regions .",
    "this is the basic physical picture for the generation of @xmath11 in the annular gap model , which is suitable for both millisecond and young pulsars with short spin periods .",
    "the detailed calculations on @xmath11 were presented in @xcite .",
    "a number of primary particles are accelerated to relativistic energies by @xmath11 in the annular and core gaps .",
    "then the primary particles emanated a great number of @xmath1-ray photons , most of them are converted into positron / electron pairs by the processes of @xmath1-b and photon - photon annihilation @xcite .",

    "the 1.4 ghz radio profile data was taken from the webpage of `` table of published ephemerides '' of fermi science support center .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the radio profile has three peaks ( denoted as peak 1 , peak 2 and peak 3 in turn from left to right ) , while the x - ray and @xmath1-ray profiles have two main peaks ( denoted as peak 1 and peak 2 from left to right ) with different peak separations .",
    "the first radio peak is almost aligned in phase with that of x - ray and @xmath1-ray . however , the other two radio peaks have complex phase separation with comparison of the second peak of x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulses .",
    "@xcite attempted to use the outer - gap model @xcite and the two - pole caustic model @xcite to explain the complex features of multi - wavelength pulse profiles , but failed , then they drawn a conclusion that it would be difficult to model the actual pulse profiles across all the three wavebands .",
    "instead , we will jointly model these three - waveband profiles in our annular gap model , and reproduce their main features including peaks and relative phase separation .",
    " 3.1 of @xcite presented the detailed method of modeling pulse profiles .",
    "the parameterized gap width and emissivities were used , which is similar to the method usually used in the polar cap and slot gap models @xcite . for both of the annular gap and core gap , we project all radiation from probable emission spots on open filed lines in the emission region to the resting sky . meanwhile ,",
    "both the related aberration effect and retardation effect are considered .",
    "an assumption of gaussian emissivities along an open field line is adopted in the modeling to speed up calculation , since this numerical assumption is consistent with physically calculated spectra in the annular gap model , as presented in figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "note that emissivities along different open field lines with a varying magnetic azimuthal ( @xmath12 ) could be different , because the out - flowing particles on different open field lines ( magnetic tubes ) with different @xmath12 could have different lorentz factors and particle numbers .",
    "this results in a patch - like emission pattern ( photon sky - map ) .",
    "the model parameters for modeling radio , x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulse profiles of psr  b1821@xmath024 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the model parameters are simply introduced below . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are magnetic inclination angle and viewing angle ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two geometry parameters used to scale the peak altitude in the annular gap ; @xmath17 is a ratio for the peak altitude in the core gap in units of the peak altitude in the annular gap ; @xmath18 is a special magnetic azimuthal used to constrain different regions which gaussian emissivities with different parameters are adopted ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are length scales in units of @xmath21 for the emission region on open field lines of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the annular gap , respectively ; @xmath24 is similar as @xmath19 , but a length scale for the core gap ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the transverse bunch scale for field lines of @xmath22 and @xmath29 in the annular gap as well as core gap , respectively .",
    "the more detailed description of these symbols is presented in @xcite .",
    "we took the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are consistent with those of the radio polarization measurement of psr  b1821@xmath024 @xcite . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the most important parameters in our model .",
    "when they are chosen , other model parameters which stands for the emission regions are then carefully adjusted to reproduce the observed light curve of each band .",
    "the modeled multi - wavelength pulse profiles of psr  b1821@xmath024 are well reproduced by the single - pole annular gap model , as presented in figure 1 .",
    "the corresponding emission heights for each band are shown in figure 2 . from modeling of the radio pulse , it is found that the radio emission has a non - caustic origin because of its gaussian emissivities ( see table 1 ) , while caustic emission tends to have a constant emissivity along an field line which is a conventional assumption as used in the two - pole caustic model @xcite .",
    "the peak 1 and peak 3 of radio pulse originate from two regions in the annular gap with intermediate altitudes of @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 to @xmath33 , respectively ; while radio peak 2 is generated in the annular gap region with higher altitudes of @xmath34 to @xmath35 . for x - ray pulse ,",
    "it is generated in the annular gap region located at only one magnetic pole .",
    "the emission heights of x - ray peak 1 are nearly overlapped with those of radio peak 1 , while the emission region of x - ray peak 2 is @xmath36 to @xmath37 , slightly higher than the heights of radio peak 3 . for @xmath1-ray pulse ,",
    "the emission is also generated in the annular gap region .",
    "peak 1 is formed by two distinct regions with altitudes of @xmath38 to @xmath39 ; while peak 2 originates from a region with altitudes of @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "-ray pulse profles of psr  b1821@xmath024 .",
    "it is found that shifted emission altitudes for each waveband in the single magnetic - pole , which leads to a patch - like emission pattern , can explain the complex properties of pulse profiles for psr  b1821@xmath024 .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "an observed integrated pulse profile is just a long - time accumulated photon counting ( for x - rays or @xmath1-rays ) or signal power measurement ( for radio emission ) based only on a certain orientation ( i.e. , line of sight ) .",
    "it is obviously difficult to obtain the whole emission pattern on the sky for a pulsar . to maximally reproducing the multi - wavelength profiles of psr  b1821@xmath024 , the values of the most important parameters are chosen as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are consistent with those derived from the radio polarization measurement with the rvm .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the effects of pulsar magnetic field configuration , emission altitude , orthogonal mode jumps , open zone radius and interstellar scattering would significantly change radio polarization properties , which results in the inaccurate values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 obtained by rvm .",
    "particularly , the situation will be even more complex when considering the propagation effects for a radio photon in a pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "as a conventional method used by the two - pole caustic model and outer gap model @xcite , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are are regarded as free parameters , and obtained via fitting pulse profiles . instead , these two values here are adopted from the existing literature @xcite to be regarded as a  reference standard \" , we carefully adjusted the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 around the standard until the multi - wavelength pulse profile were reproduced . though the final value of @xmath2 is slightly larger than the conventional values of @xmath42 presented in @xcite , but it is still in the allowable range .",
    "gaussian emissivities with distinct parameters for different region are also used to simulate profiles for three wavebands , in particular for the radio band .",
    "it is likely that radio emission is originated in a non - caustic emission mechanism .",
    "radio emission from some pulsars might be generated in a incoherent style .",
    "for instance , the radio wave could be divided into ordinary mode and extraordinary mode .",
    "when they are propagating in a pulsar s magnetosphere , due to the refraction effect for the ordinary - mode wave @xcite , the outcoming two - mode waves are separated which leads to a incoherent and non - caustic emissivities .",
    "we predict that other pulsars multi - wavelength pulse profiles with complex structures ( e.g. psr j2124@xmath03358 with four or more radio peaks ) and peak separations can be well reproduced by the self - consistent annular gap model with shifted emission altitudes .",
    "do all normal pulsars ( including young and millisecond pulsars ) share the same physical mechanism for radio emission ?",
    "this is a long - standing question that needs a larger pulsar sample and further studies .",
    "joint modeling both radio pulse profile and polarization angle curve with considerations of various effects discussed above would be a valuable work which will convincingly constrain the emission geometry of a pulsar .",
    "the multi - wavelength ( radio , x - ray and @xmath1-ray ) pulse profiles of psr  b1821@xmath024 can be explained by the annular gap model , and the emission region of the corresponding band are derived .",
    "the pulsed emission of all the three waveband are generated from the same magnetic pole .",
    "the shifted emission altitudes for each waveband in the single magnetic - pole , which leads to a patchy emission pattern , can account for the puzzling properties of pulse profiles for psr  b1821@xmath024 .",
