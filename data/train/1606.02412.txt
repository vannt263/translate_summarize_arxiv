    "continuous - wave gravitational radiation from isolated and accreting neutron stars is a key target of long - baseline interferometers like the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) and virgo detector @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that the signal is quasi - monochromatic .",
    "emission occurs at simple rational multiples of the star s spin frequency @xmath8 , for example @xmath8 and @xmath9 for mass quadrupole radiation from thermoelastic and magnetic mountains @xcite , @xmath10 for r - modes @xcite , and @xmath8 for current quadrupole radiation from nonaxisymmetric flows in the neutron superfluid pinned to the stellar crust @xcite . if the source exhibits electromagnetic pulsations , so that an ephemeris can be derived from absolute pulse numbering , i.e. @xmath11 is known as a function of time @xmath12 , it is customary to search for a signal using coherent matched filters like the maximum likelihood @xmath0-statistic @xcite .",
    "if an ephemeris is unavailable , coherent searches over multiple @xmath13 templates indexed by the taylor coefficients @xmath14 become expensive computationally @xcite , and semi - coherent methods are often preferred .",
    "cross - correlation @xcite , stackslide @xcite , the hough transform @xcite , powerflux @xcite and twospect @xcite are all examples of semi - coherent algorithms implemented by the ligo scientific collaboration and applied to data from science runs 5 or 6 .",
    "search methods that scan templates without guidance from a measured ephemeris are compromised if @xmath11 wanders randomly .",
    "radio and x - ray timing of pulsating neutron stars reveal that spin wandering is a widespread phenomenon . in isolated objects",
    ", it manifests itself as timing noise @xcite , exhibits a red fourier spectrum with an auto - correlation time - scale of days to years @xcite , and has been attributed variously to magnetospheric changes @xcite , superfluid dynamics in the stellar interior @xcite , spin microjumps @xcite , and fluctuations in the spin - down torque @xcite . in accreting objects , spin wandering results from fluctuations in the magnetized accretion torque @xcite , due to transient accretion disk formation @xcite or disk - magnetospheric instabilities and reconnection events @xcite .",
    "again the auto - correlation time - scale is of the order of days @xcite , and fluctuations in @xmath11 are accompanied by fluctuations in the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "even when the ephemeris is measured electromagnetically , the gravitational - wave - emitting quadrupole may not be phase locked to the stellar crust , and wandering must still be accommodated @xcite .",
    "hidden markov model ( hmm ) methods offer one powerful strategy for detecting and tracking a wandering frequency @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to model @xmath11 probabilistically as a markov chain of transitions between unobservable (  hidden \" ) frequency states and relate the hidden states to the observed data via a detection statistic .",
    "hmm frequency tracking enjoys a long track record of success in engineering applications ranging from radar and sonar analysis @xcite to mobile telephony @xcite .",
    "it has been refined substantially since its introduction by @xcite to include information about amplitude and phase @xcite and embrace simultaneous tracking of multiple targets and frequencies @xcite .",
    "it delivers accurate estimation , when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low but the sample size is large @xcite , the situation normally confronting gravitational wave data analysis targeting continuous - wave sources .    in this paper , we implement and test a specific hmm scheme based on the classic viterbi algorithm @xcite .",
    "the scheme is efficient and practical : its computational demands are modest , and it co - opts existing technology for ligo continuous - wave searches based on the @xmath0-statistic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the search problem in hmm language and describe how to solve it with the viterbi algorithm . in section iii , we apply viterbi tracking to an isolated neutron star with @xmath11 walking randomly , using the @xmath0-statistic to relate the hidden and observable states .",
    "we quantify the performance of the tracker as a function of signal strength using synthetic data . in section",
    "iv we apply viterbi tracking to a neutron star in a binary , again with @xmath11 wandering randomly , replacing the @xmath0-statistic with a bessel - weighted variant , and quantify its performance using synthetic data . finally , to illustrate how the tracker performs in a",
    " realistic \" scenario , we apply it to the data set prepared for stage i of the scorpius x-1 ( sco x-1 ) mock data challenge in section v @xcite .",
    "hmm principles can be applied to gravitational wave frequency tracking in various ways , depending on the data format , the detection statistic , and any known constraints on the frequency evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we specialize to continuous - wave searches , where the raw data are packaged in 30-min short fourier transforms ( sfts ) , during which @xmath11 remains localized within one fourier bin .",
    "the sfts are fed into a frequency - domain estimator @xmath15 , like the @xmath0-statistic ( isolated target ) or bessel - weighted @xmath0-statistic ( binary target ) .",
    "it is safe to assume that @xmath11 remains localized within one estimator frequency bin over a short enough time interval , even when @xmath11 walks randomly .",
    "let @xmath16 be the total observation time , and let @xmath17min be the length of each sft .",
    "for any particular astrophysical source , there exists an intermediate time - scale @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , over which @xmath11 wanders by at most one estimator bin . for timing noise in isolated pulsars ,",
    "radio timing experiments imply @xmath20 @xcite . for accretion noise in low - mass x - ray binaries , such as sco x-1 , one can estimate @xmath21days theoretically @xcite .",
    "our general strategy is to compute @xmath15 for blocks of data of length @xmath18 then use the viterbi algorithm to track peaks in @xmath15 over the full observation interval @xmath22 , effectively summing the estimator output semi - coherently by tracking @xmath11",
    ". can be as short as @xmath23 , the minimum time over which it makes sense to calculate @xmath15 , without harming the performance of the tracking algorithm .",
    "as the algorithm is semi - coherent , the strain sensitivity scales approximately as @xmath24 @xcite . ]",
    "an important practical advantage of this approach is that it leverages the existing , efficient , thoroughly tested @xmath0-statistic software infrastructure within the ligo algorithms library ( lal ) , which is used extensively by the continuous - wave data analysis community @xcite .    in this section",
    "we formulate the problem as an hmm ( section [ sec : hidden_markov][sec : setup_markov ] ) and describe the recursive viterbi algorithm for solving the problem ( section [ sec : viterbi ] ) .",
    "we defer to future work the treatment of glitches , i.e. random , impulsive , spin - up events , where @xmath13 jumps over many estimator bins instantaneously @xcite .",
    "an hmm is a probabilistic finite state automaton defined by a hidden ( unobservable ) state variable @xmath25 , which takes one of a finite set of values @xmath26 at time @xmath12 , and an observable state variable @xmath27 , which takes one of the values @xmath28 .",

    "in other words , at each time step , @xmath11 jumps at most one frequency bin up or down or stays in the same bin with equal probability @xmath61 .",
