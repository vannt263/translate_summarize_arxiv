    "the most widely accepted description of the universe is given by the @xmath0cdm model , which makes use of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) supplemented with a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "however , there are theoretical problems concerning the inclusion of the cosmological constant ( see @xcite for a review ) . one of these problems is that gr and quantum field theory the theory that describes the other fundamental interactions are incompatible @xcite .",
    "the tools of quantum field theory give a theory with an ill ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviour when applied to gr .",
    "this is one of the reasons for the interest in the search for alternative descriptions of gravity at high energies .",
    "several modifications to gr have been proposed to describe gravitational physics at ( pre-)inflationary and accelerated expansion epochs ( for a review of models of modified gravity see , for instance * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of a fundamental physical principle to construct the ultraviolet theory of gravity makes the search for such a theory a complicated quest .",
    "a pragmatic approach is to consider gr as the low energy limit of a more fundamental and so far unknown theory , the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "any formulation of quantum gravity can have new symmetries and degrees of freedom in the uv regime , but should recover or be compatible with gr in the low energy limit .",
    "an uv completion to gr was proposed in @xcite by making the theory invariant under anisotropic scaling transformations .",
    "the resulting theory is power counting renormalizable , at the expense of losing lorentz invariance in the uv limit as a consequence of the asymmetry in the transformations that are enforced , @xmath1 the critical exponent @xmath2 is adjusted to have a renormalizable theory in the uv region , but in the ir flows to @xmath3 and lorentz invariance is recovered .",
    "although this theory has been considered as a real candidate for the uv region of gr , it is plagued by the existence of new degrees of freedom which make it incompatible with gr at low energies @xcite .",
    "the cosmological implications have been studied in hoava gravity by solving the equations of motion for the full theory ( see @xcite ) and the quantum regime in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach , we consider just one of the key ingredients of hoava s proposal , the anisotropic scaling invariance and apply it on a minisuperspace having only two degrees of freedom corresponding to a metric function and a scalar field .",
    "this approach is similar to that of several works about minisuperspace noncommutativity @xcite or quantum cosmology , a well established line of research that deals with quantization in the minisuperspace @xcite and is likely to capture qualitative features of the full , non - symmetry reduced theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory will be an effective theory , that recovers gr results when the anisotropy is eliminated .",
    "for the minisuperspace model we choose the flat frw metric , so we can easily contrast our results with standard cosmology and the deviations obtained will be produced only by the modification to gr due to the invariance under anisotropic scaling .",
    "we will construct an action for this model where the minisuperspace variables are compatible with the anisotropic transformations and time reparametrization invariance is preserved .",
    "we argue that the quantization of this model leads to a schrdinger type equation for @xmath4 , as we have shown for the kantowski - sachs model in @xcite .",
    "this quantum dynamical equation with a first order time derivative allows us to construct a conserved probability current . in the case",
    "@xmath3 , the system becomes singular and we return to the original wdw equation .",
    "we also obtain the classical equations of motion and find numerical solutions for different values of the anisotropy index @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis is done by comparing with the solution obtained in gr .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section [ sdos ] the lagrangian invariant under anisotropic scaling for the frw model is presented as well as the symmetries of the theory",
    ". then we use canonical formalism to compute the hamiltonian of the model and to obtain the modified dispersion relation and the friedmann equations . in section [ stres ]",
    "we present the exact solutions for the particular cases @xmath5 and @xmath3 , and we analyze the numerical solutions for different values of the critical exponent @xmath2  also known as anisotropic index  and the cosmological constant .",
    "section [ scuatro ] is devoted for conclusions and outlook .",
    "the flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model is described , in the adm decomposition , by the line element @xmath6 , \\label{frw : metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the lapse function and @xmath8 is the scale factor .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action minimally coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath9 and a cosmological constant @xmath0 for this flat frw metric is @xmath10 ,   \\label{frw : accion}\\ ] ] where the dot represents derivatives with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the first goal in this work is to look for generalizations of this action incorporating the invariance under anisotropic scale transformations , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath2 characterizes the anisotropy of the system .",
    "besides this invariance , we also demand the action to be invariant under time reparametrizations , which means that if we see the time coordinate as a function of a parameter @xmath14 , then the action has to be invariant under any choice of @xmath14 .",
    "a final requirement that we impose on the action is that in the limit @xmath3 it has to reduce to the usual lorentz invariant action for the frw model in gr .",
    "the only action that we could find satisfying the above conditions is @xmath15 where now dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath16 in the action is necessary to achieve explicit invariance under time reparametrizations .",
    "it is straightforward to see that when @xmath3 the standard frw action is recovered .",
    "the invariances that we are requiring are satisfied if under time reparametrization @xmath17 we have @xmath18 and under anisotropic scaling @xmath19    these transformations for @xmath20 might seem to restrictive , however we will see that this is not a problem when trying to solve the equations of motion resulting from . indeed ,",
    "even the gauge @xmath21 that is usually chosen in order to simplify the equations in the @xmath3 case is compatible with .",
    "now we proceed to apply the canonical formalism to the anisotropic scaling invariant action in order to obtain the respective hamiltonian and the equations of motion .",
    "the dynamical variables that appear in action are the scale factor @xmath22 , the scalar field @xmath23 and an explicit time parametrization @xmath11 .",
    "their corresponding canonical momenta are given , as usual , by @xmath24 where the lagrangian @xmath25 is read off from the brackets in action .",
    "we can try to construct a _",
    "canonical hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath26 , but now not only we have the presence of the nondeterminate function @xmath20 but also we can not write the attempted hamiltonian without explicit reference to the velocities of the canonical variables , this is a consequence of the impossibility to invert the canonical momenta to have , e.g. @xmath27 , so strictly speaking @xmath26 is an energy functional rather than a hamiltonian .",
    "as already happens in gr we must interpret @xmath26 as a constraint @xmath28 one can verify that by choosing @xmath29 then @xmath26 can be written as a true hamiltonian and it takes the form @xmath30 , making evident the roles of @xmath20 as a lagrange multiplier and of @xmath26 as a constraint .",
    "the weak equality @xmath31 means that strictly @xmath26 is equal to zero only on a constraint hypersurface in the phase space . comparing the last result with the expression for @xmath32 we can obtain the formal relation @xmath33 unlike the weak constraint , this last relation is valid in the entire phase space",
    "this is a result with remarkable consequences at the quantum level , since the canonical quantization of this relation leads to a schrdinger - type equation , where a first order derivative in time appears @xcite , offering a possibility to solve the _",
    "frozen time problem _ of the wheeler - dewitt equation that appears when canonical quantization is applied to gr . for a review ,",
    "see for example @xcite . however , our focus in this work is on the classical theory .",
    "we must note that the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath32 does not hold for the frw model in gr since it is not well defined for @xmath3 .",
    "this should not be surprising as for @xmath3 the action does not contain any factors of @xmath16 , so a canonical momenta @xmath32 can not be defined .    although we can not write @xmath26 without any explicit reference to the velocities of the dynamical variables , we can at least remove the dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is straightforward to find @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{2z-1 } } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{n^z \\p_\\f^{2z}}{a^3\\dt^{1-z}z}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2z-1 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{z}{1 - 2z}\\left[\\frac{a^{4-z}n\\l}{\\dt}\\right]^{\\frac{z}{2z-1}}\\dt .",
    "\\label{frw : reldis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by construction , this model is invariant under time reparametrizations , thus we can choose @xmath37 .",
    "this choice is convenient to cast the right hand side of as a true hamiltonian , which on - shell satisfies the weak constraint @xmath38 .",
    "let us now derive the friedmann equations for this modified frw cosmological model .      in the framework of general relativity",
    "it is customary to obtain the friedmann equations through the einstein equations .",
    "nevertheless , they can also be obtained from the hamiltonian formalism as this is just another way to describe the same physics .",
    "specifically , they arise from the constraint @xmath39 and from the hamilton equations for the momenta of the scale factor and of the scalar field . using this identification",
    ", we find that the analogues of the friedmann equations for arbitrary values of @xmath2 are @xmath40 where we have defined the constants @xmath41 we will refer to these generalized friedmann equations simply as the friedman equations . for @xmath42 ,",
    "analytical solutions to can not be found , so we need to resort to numerical methods . before showing numerical results we present the exact solution for @xmath5 and we compare the respective numerical result with it , this is done in the next section .",
    "when @xmath3 the friedmann equations reduce to the ones obtained in gr for a flat frw metric , a cosmological constant and a massless scalar field : @xmath43 in the next section we explore the properties of the model described by .",
    "we can find analytical solutions for @xmath5 and for @xmath42 with @xmath3 .",
    "although some properties of the solutions for different @xmath2 can be studied in the first case , the main use of these exact solutions is that we can compare them to the numerical solutions in order to check the consistency of our numerical results .    for the case @xmath5 ,",
    "we combine the first two equations in obtaining @xmath44 the general solution to this differential equation is @xmath45 ^{{\\frac { ( 2 z-1 ) ^2 } { 2 z-4 { z}^2 -1}}}.\\ ] ] once we have @xmath46 , the solution for @xmath9 is obtained directly from the third equation in , i.e. the momentum conservation for the scalar field , but that is not relevant at this moment .",
    "the quotient of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is related to the time @xmath49 at which @xmath50 , whereas @xmath47 and @xmath2 determine the value of @xmath22 at @xmath51 .",
    "as expected , this solution is well behaved in the limit @xmath52 and it recovers the usual solutions @xmath53 corresponding to the massless scalar field that we are considering .",
    "nevertheless , it is straightforward to see that does not reflect the desirable characteristics that we would have expected in order to make the addition of anisotropic invariance relevant at a classical level , as would be the existence of an accelerating scale factor in the absence of the cosmological constant or the removal of the singularity @xmath50 .    in fig([l0 ] ) , we plot the analytical solutions for some values of @xmath2 as well as the corresponding numerical solutions .",
    "the constants in are chosen for each @xmath2 in order to make @xmath54 to coincide for the numerical and exact solutions .",
    "the thick lines correspond to the analytical solutions and the thin lines to the numerical solutions for the same @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that numerical numerical and exact solutions are in good agreement . also from this plot",
    ", we can verify that for @xmath55 the exponent in @xmath46 is negative and therefore there is no acceleration .",
    "this can be verified explicitly from the analytical solution .",
    "for the general case , @xmath42 and @xmath56 we will rely on the numerical results to extract conclusions on the model .    , the same type of line is used both for the numerical and exact solutions that correspond to the same @xmath2 , but the thicker lines are for the numerical results.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we take the system of hamilton equations derived from , which has the advantage of being a first order system , and solve it numerically .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen such that @xmath39 . before describing the results for @xmath57 , we check the consistency of the numerical results for @xmath3 and @xmath0 positive or negative .",
    "we do this by comparing the numerical results to the exact solution of the equation @xmath58 which is obtained by taking @xmath3 in the friedman equations and making some algebraic manipulations with them . a solution ( not the most general one )",
    "is given by @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\label{eq : az1}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related to the initial conditions for @xmath46 and its velocity .",

    "exist a @xmath49 such that @xmath64 , thus these solutions always have an initial big bang singularity .     and @xmath65 .",
    "in both cases @xmath3.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now we turn our attention to the solutions for @xmath57 .",
    "as already mentioned , here all the results are numerical .",
    "figure ( [ lambdaneg ] ) shows the results for @xmath66 .",
    "we find that as @xmath2 becomes larger than 1 the accelerated growth of @xmath46 is rapidly suppressed , in fact the scale factor grows almost linearly with time for large @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath67 the accelerated growth of the scale factor is reinforced , so that the universe expands faster than in the solution for @xmath3 .",
    "there are no clear indications that the initial singularity can be avoided in this scenario .     and different values of @xmath2.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for @xmath68 the results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ lambdapos ] .",
    "the value of @xmath2 has remarkable consequences on the behaviour of the scale factor .",
    "for example , for @xmath69 we see that there is not a @xmath49 such that @xmath64 .",
    "this characteristic is also present and more noticeable for larger values of @xmath2 , as shown in fig.([lambdaposzoom ] ) , where we can see in more detail the region where @xmath46 reaches its minimum value , @xmath70 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath70 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath71 , all the solutions describe qualitatively the same type of universes , and we can not say with confidence if all of them show a big bang singularity or not . unlike the case @xmath66 , here there is not a relevant difference when @xmath2 changes from @xmath72 to @xmath67 , epochs of accelerated expansion do not exist for any choice of @xmath2 .     and different values of @xmath2.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    .",
    "we see a non zero minimal value for the scale factor.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in this work we have analysed the effects of including invariance under anisotropic scaling in the minisuperspace as an explicit symmetry of the action .",
    "we study a simple cosmological model consisting of the flat frw metric plus a massless scalar field and a cosmological constant .",
    "a first relevant result of our analysis is that the hamiltonian formulation of the model reveals that the inclusion of anisotropic invariance is promising at the quantum level , specifically with respect to the so called _ problem of frozen time _ , since the canonical formalism of the model leads to a dispersion relation that includes a linear momenta associated to the time coordinate . after canonical quantization",
    ", this relation leads to a dynamical quantum equation that includes a first derivative in time , providing a way out to the frozen time problem .    in the main part of this work",
    ", we studied the classical solutions of the model for various values of @xmath55 .",
    "the reason to study only these values is the following : for @xmath73 the last term in the action becomes singular , thus this value of @xmath2 can be thought as separating the anisotropic index in the ranges @xmath55 , which includes the usual lorentz invariant solutions when @xmath3 , and @xmath74 .",
    "although we can suppose that the anisotropic invariance was present at very early stages of the universe and therefore @xmath2 could take any value , we want to be able to recover the lorentz invariant ( @xmath3 ) solutions at late times .",
    "assuming that the transition from anisotropic to lorentz invariance is continuous , this requirement imposes that we have to stay in the @xmath55 branch .    with respect to the solutions that we found to the anisotropic scaling invariant model",
    ", some remarks are in order :    * the limit @xmath52 is well defined for all of them . * without a cosmological constant , the inclusion of anisotropic invariance makes the volume of the universe to grow almost linearly with time . when this linear regime is reached the velocity @xmath75 is larger for larger @xmath2 . * with a negative cosmological constant , the accelerated growth of @xmath46 is suppressed for @xmath72 , whereas for @xmath67 it is reinforced . * with a positive cosmological constant we have the most remarkable modification introduced by the invariance under anisotropic scaling , namely , we can remove the big bang singularity , obtaining an @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum @xmath2 for which this is attainable depends on @xmath0 and on the initial conditions .    as an overall conclusion , the inclusion of anisotropic invariance results in desirable characteristics both at the quantum and classical levels .",
    "it gives a possible solution to the problem of time in quantum cosmology as well a resolution of the big bang singularity .",
    "however , we need to seek further for explicit exact solutions that allow us to establish firmly the existence of a non - vanishing minimum value for the scale factor , and to find analytical conditions to determine the relation between the values of @xmath2 , @xmath70 and @xmath0 . the existence of a mechanism to change dynamically the anisotropic index in such a way that the model can flow from an anisotropic invariant epoch at high energies  close to the planck scale  to a lorentz invariant epoch at lower energies is a non - trivial open question that would be interesting to study , since such a mechanism would allow us to have relevant deviations from classical solutions at high energies while recovering standard general relativity results in the infrared regime .",
