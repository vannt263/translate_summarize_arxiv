    "in 1939 , o. h. keller @xcite stated the famous conjecture which is called the jacobian conjecture : any polynomial mapping @xmath1 with nowhere vanishing jacobian is a polynomial automorphism .",

    "so the set of points at which a polynomial mapping fails to be proper plays an important role .",
