    "double - diffusive instabilities have long been known to drive mixing in stars . @xcite and @xcite first considered the combined effects of an unstable entropy gradient and a stable compositional gradient ( @xmath0gradient , hereafter ) to study what is commonly known as  semi - convection \" .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite and @xcite investigated the opposite scenario of a stable entropy gradient with an unstable @xmath0gradient , known as  thermohaline \" or  fingering \" convection . in both cases ,",
    "the overall density gradient is stable to dynamical convection ( so the system is ledoux - stable ) but the rapid diffusion of heat compared with the slower molecular diffusion of composition can destabilize the fluid , and trigger some level of turbulent mixing ( see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for instance ) .    for the next few decades , however",
    ", the lack of experimental evidence prevented astrophysicists from estimating how much mixing these instabilities could generate .",
    "only recently has it become possible to follow their nonlinear development numerically , and quantify the induced turbulent fluxes .",
    "much progress has been made in this respect thanks to three - dimensional ( 3d ) direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , both in the case of semi - convection @xcite and of fingering convection @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the latter .",
    "@xcite proposed a parameter - free , experimentally calibrated model for mixing by fingering convection in non - rotating stellar interiors , that has been successfully tested against 3d dns .",
    "the only limitation of this model is that it assumes a purely one - dimensional background , with both entropy- and @xmath1-gradients aligned with gravity .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the assumptions of most 1d stellar models , but does not necessarily represent actual conditions in stellar interiors . indeed , a number of situations may arise in which weak horizontal gradients are present . as we demonstrate here , these can have significant impacts on mixing by double - diffusive instabilities .",
    "horizontal gradients are expected whenever a star is rotating .",
    "for instance , rotation affects the convective efficiency differently at different latitudes , presumably causing pole - to - equator entropy gradients in adjacent radiative regions .",
    "it also generates large - scale meridional flows , which burrow into the nearby radiative region and drive further inhomogeneities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in radiation zones ,",
    "the centrifugal force causes a misalignment between isotherms and isobars , which also break the spherical symmetry  an effect at the source of eddington - sweet flows .",
    "even if the star is rotating too slowly for this misalignment to be significant today , its spin - down history will have generated radial differential rotation , which is always accompanied by large - scale meridional flows , and therefore by lateral entropy gradients @xcite .",
    "finally , interactions with binary companions cause tides , which are also sources of asymmetry . in these examples ,",
    "horizontal entropy gradients are presumably also accompanied by horizontal compositional gradients , which prompts the question of how fingering instabilities are modified in their presence .",
    "this question was in fact already addressed and mostly solved ( at least in the linear regime ) by @xcite , who was interested in its application to mixing in the earth s oceans  the original thermohaline case .",
    "in this letter , we apply in section 2 the linear stability analysis of @xcite to determine what effect horizontal gradients may have on double - diffusive mixing in stars . in section 3",
    "we carry out 3d dns experiments of the process to study the nonlinear evolution of the instability , and the resulting turbulent mixing .",
    "we build on the local model for fingering convection used by @xcite , and @xcite , and include the effects of horizontal gradients as in the work of @xcite .",
    "we model a small region within a star using a local cartesian coordinate system , with gravity defining the vertical direction : @xmath2 .",
    "we use the boussinesq approximation @xcite , which is valid as long as the domain height is much smaller than the local scaleheight .",
    "the background temperature and composition profiles are given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the local means @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the local gradients @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are all constant .",
    "in addition , we assume that the local adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath11 , is constant . the total fields @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are then defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    for simplicity and consistency with the oceanographic case , we define the _ potential temperature _ as the temperature in excess of a theoretical adiabatic stratification : @xmath16 . defining @xmath17 and @xmath18 as before",
    ", we then have @xmath19 .",
    "potential temperature plays a role analogous to that of entropy in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "density perturbations @xmath20 are related to @xmath21 and @xmath22 through the linearized equation of state : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coefficients of thermal expansion and compositional contraction .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that there is no net horizontal density gradient , which implies @xmath26 so - called  density - compensating \" horizontal gradients are common in the ocean ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "presumably , non - compensating gradients would drive fast horizontal flows that rapidly equalize density along isobars , turning the system into a density - compensated one .",
    "we assume here that similar arguments apply to stellar interiors .",

    "four non - dimensional numbers appear : the prandtl number @xmath37 , the diffusivity ratio @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the compositional diffusivity ) , and finally @xmath40 @xmath41 is the density ratio , which measures the strength of the stabilizing vertical potential temperature ( entropy ) gradient compared with the destabilizing @xmath1-gradient .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath42 is the slope of constant background @xmath43 surfaces .",
    "the slope of planes of constant ( background ) @xmath1 is then equal to @xmath44 .    in stellar interiors ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 can vary from @xmath47 down to @xmath48 , and @xmath45 is typically slightly greater than @xmath46 .",
    "the slope @xmath49 could reasonably be assumed to be between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , depending on the mechanism that generates the horizontal gradients .",
    "finally , @xmath41 can take any value between one ( near standard convective regions ) and infinity , provided the region supports an inverse @xmath1-gradient .",
    "it is important to note that , as a result , the slope @xmath52 of the constant-@xmath1 planes could in theory either be much smaller or much larger than one . however , we do not believe that the case @xmath53 is physically realistic in stars , and therefore always assume in what follows that @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite showed that in the absence of horizontal gradients , a system is only unstable to fingering convection if @xmath55 .",
    "cases where @xmath56 are unstable to the ledoux criterion , and therefore subject to dynamical convection .",
    "cases where @xmath57 are completely stable to fingering .",
    "@xcite showed that horizontal gradients always act to destabilize the system . in stellar interiors , where @xmath58 , this statement applies regardless of the value of the density ratio . to see this , we seek normal form solutions of ( [ eq : goveqs ] ) of the kind @xmath59 . looking for the most unstable modes of this system",
    "can be done without loss of generality assuming that @xmath60 @xcite .",

    "note that the condition @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( the fingering - stable regime ) implies that we must limit our study to @xmath74 .",

    "however , we also find that unstable modes exist for @xmath78 as soon as @xmath79 .",
    "secondly , we see that the growth rate of the fastest - growing mode for @xmath80 reaches a finite asymptotic value that scales with @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown using asymptotic analysis that for @xmath81 , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 small and of the same order , and for @xmath74 , the fastest - growing modes have the following properties : @xmath61 is real , @xmath66 and @xmath67 have opposite signs , and @xmath82 where the functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are of order unity ( for @xmath86 of order unity ) , and are related to one another .",
    "the actual expressions for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are not particularly illuminating for our present purposes , however .",
    "since @xmath74 , we see from equation ( [ eq : lambdascal ] ) that while @xmath90 remains constant as @xmath71 decreases , @xmath91 tends to 0 .",
    "given that the unstable modes can simply be viewed as fingers whose orientation is inclined at an angle @xmath92 with respect to the horizontal , we see that they become more and more inclined as @xmath93 . their width , which is reasonably well - approximated by @xmath94 , increases as @xmath95 decreases .",
    "figure [ intrusive ] explains the basic instability mechanism .",
    "note that all angles are here greatly exaggerated , to illustrate the process more clearly .",
    "the background potential temperature and compositional fields are stratified both horizontally and vertically with @xmath96 , leading to high-@xmath43/high-@xmath1 material in the top right of the figure , and low-@xmath43/low-@xmath1 material in the bottom left .",
    "since density is constant on horizontal surfaces , any parcel of fluid can be displaced to the left without loss or gain of potential energy ( 1 ) .",
    "once displaced , the parcel rapidly loses heat to the surrounding fluid , but retains its higher @xmath1 content ( 2 ) , as long as @xmath97 .",
    "it becomes denser than the surroundings , and sinks ( 3 ) .",
    "the entire process takes place in reality in a continuous fashion along inclined planes , as shown below in section 3 ( see figure [ snapshots ] ) , and causes a net transport of high-@xmath1 material from the top right to the bottom left of the domain ( 4 ) .",
    "note that similar steps ( not shown ) , starting from the bottom left and moving a parcel first to the right , lead to an upward and rightward moving parcel .",
    "in order to study the nonlinear development of the system , and estimate the rate of turbulent mixing induced by the instability , we turn to 3d dns of equations ( [ eq : goveqs ] ) .",
    "we use the same code as in @xcite and @xcite , modified by adding the terms containing @xmath71 in the temperature and compositional equations .",
    "this code assumes that all perturbations are triply - periodic in space .",
    "we present the results of a single simulation , with parameters : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "this corresponds to a reduced density ratio @xmath101 , which would be stable to fingering convection if @xmath71 was 0 .    at these parameter values ,",
    "the fastest - growing mode has @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we therefore need a computational domain of horizontal length @xmath105 that is at least equal to @xmath106 in order to contain it . in what follows ,",
    "we choose @xmath107 .",
    "this domain is fairly thin in the @xmath108 direction to save on computational time , but nevertheless sufficiently thick to capture the 3d dynamics of the problem ( see garaud and brummell , in preparation ) .",
    "the resolution used has @xmath109 effective grid - points .    in the oceanographic case ,",
    "secondary instabilities form that tend to have even larger aspect ratios ( smaller @xmath91 ) than the linear modes .",
    "containing them in the computational domain becomes prohibitive .",
    "@xcite proposed that one can still model them numerically by using an _ inclined _ computational domain , with the tilt angle chosen so that the secondary modes are perfectly horizontal in the new reference frame .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that these modes at low @xmath110 have the same angle as the primary modes .",
    "we thus tilt the domain by the angle @xmath111 ( see above ) in the numerical simulations presented below . for clarity ,",
    "any quantity measured in the tilted domain from here on is referred to with a prime ( e.g. @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "figure [ snapshots ] shows successive snapshots of our simulation . at early times",
    "the behavior of the instability is as expected from linear theory .",
    "we find that the modes are horizontal in the inclined frame , and therefore inclined at an angle @xmath115 from the true horizontal .",
    "alternating inclined fingers , whose width is roughly 30@xmath116 , carry high-@xmath1 material downward , and low-@xmath1 material upward .",
    "very rapidly , shear develops between the fingers and destabilizes them , locally mixing both entropy and composition .",
    "this weakens the stratification so that the local density ratio drops below @xmath117 , at which point regions that are properly fingering - unstable , separated by thin diffusive interfaces , appear . in the oceanographic context",
    ", these structures are called  lateral intrusions \" ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) .",
    "the over - dense part of each intrusion propagates in this plot downward and to the left , while the under dense part propagates to the right and upward .",
    "later , we see that the fingering region from one intrusion impinges on the one below , and the weakest of the two disappears .",
    "this results in a progressive coarsening of the system , which exhibits fewer and fewer yet gradually stronger intrusions with time .        to better understand the structure of the intrusions , we show in figure [ stratif ] various profiles at time @xmath118 ( see final snapshot in figure [ snapshots ] ) .",
    "we clearly see extended regions where the total temperature and compositional fields increase with @xmath113 , which are associated with weak along - intrusion flows , and a local density ratio that remains smaller than @xmath119 .",
    "these are the fingering layers observed in figure [ snapshots ] . separating them are thin diffusive interfaces where both gradients reverse sign .",
    "these interfaces could in principle be semi - convectively unstable , in the sense that they support both an unstable potential temperature gradient , and a stable compositional gradient , and that their density ratio @xmath120 lies above the critical value @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "however , the strong interfacial shear , combined with the fact that the region is quite thin , presumably stabilizes the interface against semi - convection ( at least , in this simulation ) .     of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and of @xmath114 , averaged along @xmath124 and @xmath125 , at @xmath126 .",
    "right : local density ratio @xmath120 , defined as the ratio of the @xmath113-derivatives of the potential temperature and compositional profiles shown on the left .",
    "horizontal lines highlight two of diffusive interfaces.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the fingering regions cause substantial vertical transport , bringing high-@xmath43/high-@xmath1 material downward , and low-@xmath43/low-@xmath1 material upward .",
    "this net flux must be accompanied by an equivalent interfacial flux , since we do not observe any pile - up just above the interfaces . the interfacial flux is primarily caused by shear instabilities , as pure diffusion across the interface actually acts in the opposite direction ( because of the reversal of the sign of both gradients ) .",
    "our findings are generally consistent with those in the oceanographic context @xcite .",
    "since @xmath115 is presumably very small in real stars , we can get an approximation of the amount of vertical transport in the system ( i.e. along @xmath127 ) simply by considering the turbulent fluxes perpendicular to the intrusions ( i.e. along @xmath113 ) .",
    "the resulting ( dimensional ) potential temperature and compositional fluxes , in the tilted domain , are then simply given by @xmath128 where the angular brackets denote a box - average .",
    "this defines the effective diffusivities @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "figure [ merger ] shows that the turbulent fluxes gradually increase as the intrusions coarsen . while @xmath131 remains close to one",
    ", @xmath132 is of the order of 30 at the end of the simulation , showing that compositional mixing is significantly enhanced by the intrusive instability , but that heat transport is not .",
    "since we have not been able to follow the coarsening beyond the 3-intrusion phase , it remains to be seen whether the latter has stalled , or simply proceeds on a much longer timescale than we were able to integrate the simulation for .     and @xmath125-averaged @xmath133 profile as a function of time .",
    "bottom : non - dimensional effective diffusivities for vertical transport ( see equation [ eq : ftfmu ] ) as a function of time .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have shown that horizontal entropy and compositional gradients in a stably - stratified radiation zone can trigger new double - diffusive instabilities , that evolve to form stacks of fingering layers separated by sheared diffusive interfaces , called intrusions .",
    "turbulent compositional mixing in this regime is significantly more efficient than pure diffusion , and could explain some of the long - standing discrepancies between theory and observations of stellar abundances , as in the case of low - mass rgb stars for instance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "much work remains to be done , however .",
    "first and foremost , we need to extend our numerical analysis towards more realistic parameters ( lower @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath71 ) , and carry out a comprehensive study of parameter space as in @xcite . this is needed to determine how the cross - intrusion transport rates scale with governing parameters , and with the intrusion heights .",
    "this task is computationally expensive , since the already - large domain size and resolution need to be increased further when @xmath95 , @xmath45 or @xmath46 decrease .",
    "we also need to study the conditions under which the small - scale primary instability ( see section 2 ) transitions to the large - scale intrusive instability . while many models have been proposed to explain the formation of oceanic intrusions ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it remains unclear whether they apply in astrophysics .",
    "the unified mean - field theory developed by @xcite is a promising approach in this respect .",
    "we also need to determine whether the intrusion coarsening process observed in our simulations proceeds indefinitely , or eventually stalls for a given intrusion height .",
    "finally , we must determine whether any of the effects that were invoked as the possible origin of horizontal gradients ( such as rotation , or slow large - scale flows ) could have a sufficiently large influence on the development of both primary and secondary intrusive instabilities to invalidate our results .",
    "nevertheless , these findings open an interesting set of new possibilities for mixing in stellar interiors , that had not been explored so far ."
