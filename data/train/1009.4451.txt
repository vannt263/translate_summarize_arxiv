    "in physics it is sometimes useful to decompose a multi  component variable / quantity with respect to a pair of orthogonal subspaces spanning its range .",
    "examples relevant for the area of application that we target here , namely qcd and its vacuum structure , include the decomposition of a bispinor into left ",
    "right chirality components , and the decomposition of the gauge field strength tensor into self  dual and anti  self  dual parts . physical reasons for",
    "considering such decompositions usually have to do with the fact that the dynamics of the variable involves ( or is expected to involve ) a specific type of relation among such suitably defined projections .",
    "the expected correlations can then be tested in a relevant physical experiment or evaluated in theoretical calculations .",
    "the property of polarization , namely the tendency for asymmetric participation of the two subspaces in the preferred values of the variable , is frequently of interest in the above context . while the qualitative meaning of the concept is obvious , the ways to characterize and quantify the degree of polarization in the dynamics are highly non",
    "a priori_. one typically operates under the implicit assumption that the physical context uniquely `` selects the tools '' , i.e.  that the choice of the polarization characteristics is driven by the physical nature of the quantity at hand .",
    "there are situations however , the study of qcd vacuum structure being one of them , where we may be interested in polarization characteristics that pertain to dynamics alone and are not conditioned on which specific physical situation the dynamics is modelling . our goal in this paper is to develop a framework to describe and quantify such _ dynamical tendency for polarization_. in addition to being free of kinematic effects , we also require that the framework provides a possibility for high level of detail .",
    "in other words , we are not only interested in a suitable average polarization parameter , but rather want the aspects of polarization to be separated from other content of the dynamics .    to construct our formalism",
    ", we will build upon the @xmath0distribution proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite which grew from similar motivations albeit with a specific aim to characterize the local chirality of qcd dirac eigenmodes .",
    "the @xmath0distribution approach is based on the following logic .",
    "consider the left ",
    "right decomposition @xmath4 of the local value in the eigenmode , and some function @xmath5 that reflects the degree of chiral polarization in @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath7 is defined at every space  time point , it is a local characteristic providing the information on changes in the left ",
    "right polarization within the mode .",
    "the equilibrium ensemble of qcd gauge configurations induces the distribution of associated @xmath7values for chosen sets of eigenmodes.values , such as restrictions to space  time regions with strong fields , were frequently used . ] in other words , denoting by @xmath0 an independent variable whose domain is in the range of @xmath7 , there exists a function @xmath8 , namely the probability distribution of the polarization characteristic specified by @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0distribution @xmath8 provides rather detailed information about the chiral polarization properties of the selected group of modes .    while the concept of @xmath0distributions is suitable for our purposes , the issue of `` dynamical versus kinematical ''",
    "has not been explicitly addressed in that framework .",
    "the channel through which kinematics enters here is the function @xmath7 since there is a large freedom in choosing measures that qualitatively reflect chiral polarization . rather than analyzing this freedom ,",
    "the related work was carried out with the implicit rationale that the proper fixed choice of this _ polarization function _ can be made .",
    "for example , the original definition in ref .",
    "@xcite involved @xmath7 linear in the polar angle of point @xmath9 from the `` left  right plane '' ( chiral orientation parameter ) .",
    "this was used in most of the early follow  up works  @xcite with some departures  @xcite . however , especially in the case of dirac eigenmodes , it is not entirely clear which physical consideration should fix the selection .",
    "thus , focusing exclusively on the dynamics , in the sense discussed above , provides a meaningful direction to proceed in .    with the above discussion in mind ,",
    "we wish to propose a construct that ( 1 ) provides a detailed differential information on polarization modeled after the @xmath0distribution but ( 2 ) does nt rely on a fixed polarization function @xmath7 , and ( 3 ) reflects only the dynamics . note that while the involvement of kinematics proceeds via the polarization function @xmath7 , requirement ( 2 ) only represents a necessary condition for this characteristic to be considered purely dynamical .",
    "indeed , we view the concept of `` dynamical '' in this context as entailing a specific meaning of `` correlational '' or , in more general terms , based on some form of comparison to statistical independence .",
    "this is why the requirements ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are listed separately and need to be fulfilled simultaneously .    to satisfy these requirements ,",
    "we first reinterpret the @xmath0distribution as a relative measure . in other words , we show that one can view @xmath8 not only as an object assigned to given dynamics and the polarization function , but also as an object comparing this dynamics to another dynamics associated with the polarization function in question .",
    "we develop a formalism that allows us to switch freely between the two interpretations which , in technical terms , allows us to construct an @xmath0distribution for arbitrary pair of dynamics . equipped with this tool",
    ", we then proceed to define a truly dynamical characteristic as a relative @xmath0distribution assigned to dynamics of interest and the related one where left and right components are chosen independently of one another from corresponding marginal distributions .",
    "note that the latter is the needed point of comparison representing statistical independence .",
    "the crucial point , implicitly embedded in this procedure , is that it is independent of the polarization function used to carry it out . in other words , while the implementation must proceed via some polarization function @xmath7 , the final result does nt depend on this choice .",
    "we thus refer to the above dynamical characteristic as an _ absolute @xmath0distribution _ in order to distinguish it from the original one that can only be viewed in a relative sense.distribution_ , explicitly emphasizing the fact that its purpose is to remove any kinematical content from the description of polarization . ]    in terms of requirement ( 3 ) , one can draw a parallel between our construction and the definition of the pearson correlation coefficient for random variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 governed by a joint probability distribution @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the corresponding standard deviations .",
    "computing just @xmath16 will not convey any dynamical information ( it wo nt tell us anything about tendencies of the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , nor does this value have any specific statistical meaning . however , after the subtraction of `` uncorrelated relationship '' @xmath17 , the resulting covariance acquires a qualitative dynamical content .",
    "finally , the normalization via standard deviations , ensuring that @xmath18 , gives the coefficient a well - defined statistical meaning , and thus a quantitative dynamical significance . in effect , the dynamical construct that we propose implements the `` subtraction of statistical independence '' at the level of distributions which , among other things , has an added bonus that proper normalizations are automatically in place .    with absolute @xmath0distribution at hand",
    ", one can naturally define an averaged quantity based on it , and this role is played by the _ correlation coefficient of polarization _ ( ccp ) .",
    "ccp has a clear statistical meaning in that it is linearly related to the probability that the sample chosen from the distribution governing the dynamics is more polarized than the sample chosen from its counterpart with statistically independent components .",
    "one utility of ccp is that it naturally ranks ( orders ) possible dynamics with respect to the polarization . in particular , larger ccp means larger dynamical tendency for polarization .",
    "moreover , the positive ccp signals that the dynamics enhances the polarization relative to statistical independence , while the negative value means that polarization is being dynamically suppressed . due to its absolute nature , we propose ccp as a basic `` figure of merit '' quantifying polarization properties inherent to dynamics .    as a first application of the above techniques , we analyze local chiral properties of low  lying qcd dirac eigenmodes .",
    "it was already the motivation of ref .",
    "@xcite that local properties of these modes are expected to be connected to low  energy features of qcd , especially to those related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ". however , our goals in this investigation are quite different from those of ref .  @xcite . rather than checking the consistency of assumptions for certain models , as we did in ref .",
    "@xcite which contains the preliminary discussion of techniques developed here , our aim is to build a model  independent information on relevant properties of these modes in line with the _ bottom  up _ approach to qcd vacuum structure as formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , it is the purpose of this series  @xcite to contribute to developing the set of techniques that can facilitate these goals .    the summary of our main initial findings on the chiral polarization properties of low ",
    "lying overlap dirac eigenmodes are as follows .",
    "the absolute @xmath0distributions of the lowest modes are convex on their domain , while the @xmath0distributions of higher modes are concave .",
    "this implies that the lowest modes exhibit a dynamical tendency for chirality ( positive ccp ) while the higher modes dynamically suppress it ( negative ccp ) . at fixed volume and lattice spacing",
    ", there exists a transition point @xmath19 in the spectrum where the absolute @xmath0distribution is strictly flat , and the polarization properties are indistinguishable from statistical independence . based on four lattice spacings ,",
    "our data supports the proposition that this scale remains finite in the continuum limit , i.e.  @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the appearance of this sharply  defined new feature in the qcd dirac spectrum could be relevant for understanding the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start by discussing an explicit example of the absolute @xmath0distribution calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : primer ] .",
    "our goal here is to provide a concise introduction to the method with sufficient practical and conceptual information for it to be directly applied to the problem of interest here , namely the study of local chiral properties in overlap dirac eigenmodes .",

    "indeed , this discussion is carried out in a completely generic setting , emphasizing the universal applicability of the formalism to any area where the concept of polarization plays relevant role .",
    "given that our first application of absolute polarization methods targets chiral properties of dirac eigenmodes , we will use the specifics of that setting to introduce the approach . for definiteness , consider the set of lattice dirac eigenmodes comprised of lowest two ( non  zero ) conjugate pairs on gauge backgrounds from ensemble @xmath22 of table  [ tab : ensembles ] . and are not important for this discussion . ] collecting all local values @xmath6 from these modes into single pool , let us consider the associated collection of two  component objects @xmath23 , namely the magnitudes of left and right components of @xmath6 @xmath24 the distribution of these `` samples '' is shown on the left side of fig .",

    "[ fig : sr_vs_sru ] we plot the result of this construction for data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_e1 ] .",
    "one can see that the correlated and uncorrelated dynamics have very similar polarizations since the graph is close to being linear . to obtain a differential comparison , and to better see the differences , we compute the slope of the cumulative polarization graph and show it on the right side of fig .

    "since this dependence represents a probability distribution in variable @xmath45 , we can see that the correlated case exhibits a small excess of probability with respect to the uncorrelated one ( the horizontal line ) near the extremal values .",
    "noting that the extremal values @xmath46 actually correspond to strictly polarized cases @xmath47 respectively , the observed qualitative behavior of the slope graph in fact conveys the excess of polarization in dynamics described by @xmath25 relative to dynamics described by @xmath35 . to standardize this polarization characteristic ,",

    "the resulting construct @xmath51 will be referred to as the _",
    "absolute @xmath0distribution_.    we now wish to make several remarks regarding the above method .    _",
    "( i ) _ performing a practical calculation of absolute @xmath0distribution with uniform resolution in @xmath0 requires that we evaluate cumulative probabilities at values @xmath52 that split the uncorrelated population into @xmath53 bins of equal size .",

    "[ fig : e1_10bins ] .    _",
    "( ii ) _ as one can readily inspect , the above geometric construction would lead to the same result had we decided to quantify the degree of chiral polarization in @xmath6 by some arbitrary _ polarization function _ @xmath57 rather than by the default choice @xmath58 . indeed , such different possibilities correspond to different parametric representations of the same curve in the @xmath59 plane , and this information drops out of the calculation .",
    "the associated _ reparametrization invariance _ is significant since it expresses the fact that the proposed description of polarization is independent of the `` language '' ( or `` reference frame '' ) chosen to represent the concept at the sample level .",
    "this is necessary for the description to be considered purely dynamical and reflects the absolute nature of this construction .",
    "0.10 in distribution ( left ) and absolute @xmath0distribution ( right ) for data shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : dyn_e1 ] with resolution of 10 bins.,title=\"fig : \" ]    -0.00 in    -0.3 in [ fig : e1_10bins ]    _ ( iii ) _ the definition of absolute @xmath0distribution given above is equivalent to constructing the @xmath0distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite , but associated with polarization function @xmath60 this makes the fact that the absolute @xmath0distribution represents a valid polarization measure more explicit .",
    "in fact , depending on the dynamics @xmath25 in question , the procedure adjusts the polarization characteristic so that it directly measures deviations relative to uncorrelated dynamics . in this language ,",
    "the reparametrization invariance of absolute @xmath0distribution follows from the fact that @xmath61 is invariant under the choice of reference polarization coordinate as one can directly verify .    _",
    "( iv ) _ we wish to emphasize that the strong dependence on the choice of the polarization function ( dependence on `` kinematics '' ) provided a major motivation for extending the old @xmath0distribution approach in the direction described here . indeed , as discussed extensively in appendix  [ sec : general ] , even qualitative conclusions can be entirely misleading if one relies only on the @xmath0distribution associated with fixed polarization function .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : arbitrary ] where a suitable choice of polarization function can either produce seemingly clear chiral double  peaking or what appears as completely non  chiral single peak .    _",
    "( v ) _ in addition to detailed description of polarization contained in absolute @xmath0distribution , we also define a single figure of merit reflecting the overall dynamical tendency for polarization , namely @xmath62 the positive value of this _ correlation coefficient of polarization _ @xmath63 $ ] indicates that the dynamics enhances polarization relative to randomness , while the negative value implies its dynamical suppression .",
    "indeed , as one can check ( see appendix  [ sec : general ] ) , @xmath64 is linearly related to the probability that the sample chosen from @xmath25 is more polarized than the sample ( independently ) chosen from @xmath35 , leading to the above interpretation .",
    "the elements described in this section are at the core of the general dynamical polarization method we are proposing in this work .",
    "formal definitions and detailed discussion of the logical structure involved are given in appendix  [ sec : general ] . while the concise overview given in this section is sufficient to apply the method to the case of qcd dirac eigenmodes in what follows , we emphasize that the content of appendix  [ sec : general ] is important not only for deeper understanding the scope and the meaning of the approach , but also for its practical application in case of singular polarization dynamics",
    "we will now apply the absolute polarization methods to the case of low  lying qcd dirac eigenmodes in a more systematic manner . as argued extensively e.g.  in ref .",

    "they are in fact the relevant eigenmodes to consider in the context of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .      in order to get the basic idea about the dynamical tendency for chirality in the obtained eigenmodes , we first focus on the lowest non  zero and highest computed modes . for this purpose ,",
    "we collect into the `` lowest '' eigenmode group the two lowest near ",

    "rather , all local values are part of the dynamics , as they should be .    an interesting aspect of fig .",
    "[ fig : pr - low - high ] is the comparison of left and right columns , i.e.  the comparison of pure kinematics ( right side ) to kinematics combined with dynamics ( left side ) . as one can see , the two are barely distinguishable implying that the qualitative appearance of reference @xmath0distributions is almost entirely driven by kinematics . in order to expose the dynamical polarization tendencies , we construct the corresponding absolute @xmath0distributions that effectively remove the features due to kinematics .",

    "[ fig : pa - low - high ] with lowest modes on the left and highest modes on the right .",

    "in fact , one can read from the graph complete differential information on how much enhancement / suppression there is for arbitrary segment of uncorrelated population .",
    "the correlation coefficient of polarization ( ccp ) is obviously positive for the lowest modes , and the dynamics governing them exhibits the dynamical tendency for polarization .",

    "most situations of practical interest are covered in this way but when the departure from @xmath229 , @xmath228 is necessary , we will explicitly point it out .",

    "the feature that puts all polarization functions @xmath251 on the same footing is that they are equally good comparators of polarization on the sample space due to strict monotonicity .",
    "in other words , if sample @xmath23 was established to be more polarized than @xmath266 using polarization function @xmath267 , then this would hold also if any other @xmath251 was used to relate them .",

    "let us compare the dynamics ( distribution ) @xmath268 to dynamics @xmath269 via the probability @xmath270 that a sample drawn from @xmath268 is more polarized than a sample independently drawn from @xmath269 .",
    "while one can approach the determination of @xmath270 using different polarization functions , the answer will always be the same .",
    "indeed , this invariance becomes obvious if one pictures evaluation of @xmath270 by producing simultaneous draws from @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and recording the double  sequence of corresponding reference polarization coordinates @xmath271 .",
    "the relative frequency of encountering @xmath272 in this process determines @xmath270 , and the result would not change had we tested whether @xmath273 instead . obviously , the information stored in @xmath274 , @xmath275 is sufficient to carry out the above process and in terms of the associated @xmath0distributions we have formally @xmath276 where we have made the dependence of various objects on the dynamics and the polarization function explicit everywhere . for obvious reasons ,",
    "@xmath270 will be referred to as the _ probability of larger polarization _ ( plp ) in @xmath268 relative to @xmath269 .",
    "more detailed invariant objects can be defined using analogous reasoning .",
    "one example relevant for our purposes involves the probability @xmath277 that a sample drawn from @xmath268 is more polarized in the first direction than fraction @xmath278 ( @xmath279 ) of the population drawn from @xmath269 .",

    "it is clear that we could have used arbitrary @xmath291 to make all the above comparisons with the same result .",

    ". we will refer to it as _ relative @xmath0distribution _ of @xmath268 relative to @xmath269 .",
    "note that , by construction , if @xmath295 , i.e.  when comparing given dynamics to itself , we have @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "discussion of the previous section fully defines two new objects , namely the probability of larger polarization @xmath270 and the relative @xmath0distribution @xmath298 , both assigned to a pair of polarization dynamics from @xmath229 .",
    "however , in order to connect them to previously defined @xmath184 and @xmath260 , we need to convert the constructive definitions into explicit ones .",
    "let us start by a closer look at equation ( [ eq:100 ] ) representing @xmath270 which can be written as @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the polarization function assigned to dynamics @xmath301 ( or @xmath275 ) via natural map ( [ eq:94.40 ] ) .",

    "consider the dynamics @xmath25 with support only on line @xmath347 . while the pearson correlation will be perfect ( @xmath73 ) in this case , it is obvious that there is no dynamical tendency for polarization in such dynamics .",
    "in fact , it is just the opposite with dynamics inhibiting any possibility of polarized samples .",
    "indeed , the absolute plp is obviously zero in this situation for all dynamics with non  singular marginal distributions .",
    "these dynamics are thus perfectly antipolarized and characterized by @xmath348 as appropriate .      at this point",
    "we wish to briefly comment on including in the formalism of absolute @xmath0distributions the cases involving dynamics @xmath38 for which the associated polarization dynamics @xmath222 is not an element of @xmath229 . let us recall that there were no restrictions on the notion of standard @xmath0distribution @xmath235 which can be uniquely assigned to arbitrary @xmath215 and @xmath255 . however , it was natural to focus on the case of bijective maps ( elements of @xmath229 , @xmath228 ) , especially as we transitioned to the notion of relative @xmath0distributions .",

    "in fact , everything discussed in the context of relative @xmath0distributions applies to arbitrary @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "while this covers most cases of practical interest , it does not afford the construction of absolute @xmath0distributions for @xmath38 with @xmath352 since in that case @xmath48 is typically not an element of @xmath229 either .",
    "the main point about the extension from @xmath351 to @xmath353 in the context of relative @xmath0distributions is that it may not simultaneously retain the features coexisting in the former case .",
    "in particular , with faithful polarization comparators @xmath351 we have the interpretation of @xmath323 $ ] both in terms of standard @xmath0distribution with particular polarization function , and in terms of statistical comparisons between the two dynamics , as described in constructive definition of sec .",
    "[ subsec : rel_measures ] .",
    "in fact , one can easily see that this dual view of the concept extends to the case when @xmath354 . indeed , the object @xmath355 needed in the definition @xmath323 \\equiv   \\hat{s } [ \\ , s_{(1 ) } , s_\\star^{-1 } \\circ s_{(2 ) } \\,]$ ] is a valid polarization function in this case , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : correspondence ] . at the same time , this definition is equivalent to the comparative one in unchanged form .",
    "however , the situation is different when @xmath316 is discontinuous and thus represents dynamics with probabilistic atoms .",
    "the extensions in that case are non  unique in both of the two approaches that become non  equivalent in general .",
    "if one follows the rationale of polarization functions , then it is natural to simply extend the @xmath356 operation using eq .",

    "[ subsubsec : correspondence ] .",
    "when utilizing this definition , then absolute @xmath0distribution assigned to dynamics that one generally thinks of as maximally polarized , i.e.  those with @xmath358 , is @xmath359 and the correlation coefficient is @xmath360 .",
    "however , if one prefers to focus on the concept of statistical comparisons , then one is led to an alternative path which we now briefly describe .    the root cause of ambiguity in the comparative definitions of sec .",
    "[ subsec : rel_measures ] is that for distributions with atoms , comparisons using `` @xmath361 '' and `` @xmath362 '' can become non  equivalent , and one has to fix the treatment of the `` @xmath363 '' case . to see the associated issues , let us again consider the polarization dynamics @xmath364 , but assume in addition that the underlying dynamics @xmath38 has a marginal distribution @xmath365 .",
    "this implies that its uncorrelated polarization dynamics is @xmath366 . adopting the comparative scheme with sharp inequalities ( as we did in sec .",

    "the natural approach is to insist that eq .",
    "( [ eq:124 ] ) be satisfied and that the two dynamics being compared are treated on equal footing .",

    "@xmath368=1/4 $ ] , implying that @xmath369 in this case .",
    "we emphasize that while we are focusing on a specific example , the above rule uniquely fixes the assignment of plp and the correlation coefficient for all possible dynamics .",

    "[ fig : strict ] the construction of @xmath372 for @xmath364 relative to @xmath371 , and the associated absolute @xmath0distribution @xmath373 .",
    "note that @xmath374 consistently with the above prescription for plp .      apart from reparametrization invariance , absolute measures possess additional symmetry that we would like to mention . to do that , it is instructive to think of reparametrization invariance in the following way .",
    "imagine that the generator based on the dynamics @xmath25 produces the sequence of samples @xmath375 , distributed accordingly .",
    "the operator of the device broadcasts the sequence to various distant receivers , each of which has a polarization meter at his disposal .",
    "when fed a sample @xmath376 , the polarization meter outputs its degree of polarization @xmath377 , thus allowing each receiver to analyze the polarization properties of @xmath38 .",
    "while the operation of each existing polarization meter is based on a valid polarization function @xmath251 , there is no standard choice adopted by the manufacturers .",
    "thus , each receiver obtains a different sequence @xmath378 to work on in general . this would seem to preclude the possibility of producing equivalent polarization characteristics across the spectrum of receivers .",
    "however , every receiver is required to follow special instructions , identical for all , on how to use his polarization meter to determine the _ dynamical _ polarization properties of the transmitted dynamics . according to this recipe , in addition to running @xmath375 through the polarization meter and producing @xmath378",
    ", he is also required to form an independent sequence   @xmath379 , in which the received components are assigned to one another randomly rather than as dictated by the dynamics .",
    "the receiver is then to run this randomized sequence through his polarization meter to obtain the associated @xmath380 .",
    "finally , he is instructed to perform the statistics of comparisons between @xmath377 and @xmath381 to yield the desired dynamical measure of polarization ( absolute @xmath0distribution or correlation coefficient ) .",
    "reparametrization invariance expresses the fact that , assuming they follow the above recipe , all receivers will end up with exactly the same dynamical polarization characteristic .",
    "thus , by virtue of providing the above instructions , the sender does nt have to worry about the fact that receivers use various kinds of polarization meters .",
    "the additional symmetry of absolute measures pertains to the fact that , to some extent , the same is also true in reverse . in particular , by virtue of the same prescription , the receivers are protected from the fact that the sender could have used various kinds of generators .",
    "indeed , recall that the purpose of the formalism that we developed was to extract from the full dynamics of quantity @xmath109 the information on polarization . in doing that",
    ", we postulated that the information on dynamics of magnitudes @xmath10 , @xmath11 of the projections , i.e.  @xmath25 , is sufficient for this since the relevant measures are based on the ratios of these magnitudes .",
    "however , we could have used the distribution of @xmath382 ( @xmath383 ) associated with the same dynamics of @xmath109 for this purpose .",
    "thus , different senders communicating information on the same dynamics could have used different kinds of generators and sending the sequence of samples @xmath384 , instead of @xmath375 . as one",
    "can easily see though , the above recipe for constructing absolute measures guarantees that the result is insensitive to this freedom because the statistics of required comparisons will not change .",
    "formally , these measures are invariant under @xmath385 it is due to simultaneous validity of both types of above invariances that we view the constructs discussed here as universal polarization characteristics truly characterizing the dynamics itself , rather than representing our choices for description of polarization .",
    "in this appendix we will discuss certain numerical aspects of the results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcd ] . while the implementation described below was applied specifically to the case of overlap dirac eigenmodes , one can of course use these strategies in more general settings .",
    "we will pay most attention to the computation of absolute @xmath0distributions , but will also discuss the calculation of correlation coefficient @xmath386 and the procedure for the determination of chiral polarization scale @xmath95 .    before we start , it is useful to recall that the input for our calculations is certain dynamics @xmath387 , but we only have a restricted statistical knowledge of it from relevant numerical simulation . in other words , what we have is a finite population of pairs @xmath388 , whose statistics is governed by @xmath387 . by virtue of this finite population , the latter can be thought of as being `` approximated '' by a discrete distribution @xmath389 where the second equation relates to the `` uncorrelated '' counterpart @xmath390 of @xmath387 . in case of dirac eigenmodes the population comes from local values in the selected group of modes , such as those at scale @xmath80 in given gauge ensemble , with pairs representing the magnitudes of right and left chiral components .",
    "our implementation followed the primer calculation described in sec .",
    "[ sec : primer ] .",
    "technical details not specified there have to do with the finiteness of the population representing @xmath25 and the fact that , while one wishes to have its size @xmath280 as large as possible in order to represent the dynamics adequately , the computational complexity involved in handling the complete information as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a20 ] ) grows as @xmath391 in case of uncorrelated distribution .",
    "since @xmath280 can be quite large even with relatively modest size of gauge ensembles , i.e.  we have @xmath392 for ensemble @xmath393 with only two eigenmodes per configuration contributing , it is computationally advantageous to do some coarse  graining as explained below .    * absolute @xmath0distribution . * given our statistics , we have decided to evaluate @xmath56 at @xmath394 equidistant values based on the information stored in the associated @xmath394 bins of probability .",
    "this allows us to plot the distribution with enough resolution to capture relevant details while it also allows for enough statistics in each bin so that the statistical errors are reasonably small . in order to reduce the computational effort , we organized the calculation as follows :    * compute the reference polarization coordinates @xmath395 representing the boundaries of each bin . to avoid the numerical evaluation of inverse tangent and using the fact that our construction does nt depend on the parametrization of the polar angle",
    ", we actually work directly with slopes @xmath396 ( @xmath397 ) .",
    "these slopes separate the sample space quadrant into segments containing equal number of samples drawn from the uncorrelated distribution @xmath398 . in fig .",

    "count how many samples @xmath400 drawn from the correlated distribution @xmath401 fall into each bin by comparing their slope with the boundaries determined in the previous step .",
    "since we only need to inspect each sample once to determine which bin it belongs to , the second step has a complexity @xmath402 , which is negligible compared to the first step which is @xmath403 in the naive implementation .",
    "one possibility to deal with the first step is to use a randomly drawn sub ",
    "population from the corresponding @xmath404 samples to approximate the uncorrelated distribution .",
    "the problem with this approach is that it interferes with the error analysis .",

    "to speed it up , we sort the values @xmath412 and separate them into bins with equal number of samples .",
    "each bin is then replaced by a single representative value equal to the average of the samples it contains . for the smallest ensemble @xmath417 where one can comfortably carry out the calculation without binning , we compared the results of the binned version using 1000 elements per bin with the exact calculation .",
    "we found that the differences are much smaller than the error bars . for larger ensembles ,",
    "the approximation is expected to be even better since the number of samples is increased .",
    "the binned version was thus used in our evaluations .",
    "the result of the above calculation determines the fraction of samples drawn from @xmath401 belonging to each of the @xmath53 bins .",
