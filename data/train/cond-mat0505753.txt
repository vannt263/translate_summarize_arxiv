    "brownian motors are small scale engines that operate on the basis of nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "most of the models that have been discussed previously in the literature refer to the transfer of chemical or potential energy into work @xcite by brownian entities that operate in a externally imposed asymmetric environment ( or by spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite ) . in this case , a @xmath0 percent efficiency can in principle be achieved @xcite , in accordance with the basic laws of thermodynamics .",
    "recently , a thermal brownian motor was introduced @xcite , for which an exact microscopic analysis turns out to be possible @xcite .",
    "the model can be viewed as a simplification of the feynman - smoluchowski ratchet @xcite .",
    "this construction differs in two essential aspects from most other brownian motors .",
    "first , the source of energy is the presence of different heat baths .",
    "thermodynamics thus predicts that the limiting efficiency is that of the carnot engine .",
    "second , the asymmetry is an intrinsic property of the motor , not of the environment or of the imposed constraint .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review some further properties of this construction , and to discuss in particular specific issues including the relation with macroscopic response and the efficiency at maximum power .",
    "we first briefly review the basic construction of the thermal brownian motor and the main results .",
    "the motor consists of a set of convex units @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , that move as a rigidly linked entity with a single degree of freedom , along a specified direction @xmath3 .",
    "each unit resides in a separate , infinitely large compartment that is filled with an ideal gas at equilibrium .",
    "these compartments play a role akin to the thermal reservoirs in a carnot construction . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of spatial dimension @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] we show four different realizations of the motor .",
    "the gas particles are point particles of mass @xmath6 . their density , temperature and maxwellian velocity distribution in compartment @xmath1",
    "are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , with : @xmath10 we consider the limit in which the mean free path of the gas particles is much larger than the linear dimension of the motor unit . in this case",
    ", there are no pre - collisional correlations between the speed of the motor and that of the impinging particles .",
    "the probability density @xmath11 for the speed @xmath12 therefore obeys a boltzmann - master equation : @xmath13.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 is the transition probability per unit time for the motor to change speed from @xmath15 to @xmath16 due to the collisions with the gas particles in the compartments @xmath17 .",
    "its explicit form , following from the collision rules and basic arguments from kinetic theory , is given by ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath18   \\delta \\left [     v - v^\\prime -     \\frac{2 \\frac{m}{m } \\sin^2 \\theta}{1+\\frac{m}{m } \\sin^2 \\theta }     \\left ( v_x^\\prime - v_y^\\prime \\cot\\theta -v^\\prime   \\right )     \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the @xmath20 dirac function selects appropriate particle velocities yielding the post - collisional speed @xmath16 for the motor in function of the precollisional speeds @xmath15 and @xmath21 of motor and gas particle respectively .",
    "the shape of the motor unit @xmath1 is characterized by a normalized shape function @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 is the fraction of the outer surface of the unit that has a tangent between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , cf .",
    "[ fig : shape ] .",
    "the angle @xmath24 is measured counterclockwise from the horizontal @xmath3 direction .",
    "the total perimeter will be denoted by @xmath26 .        .",
    "the length of the surface with an orientation between @xmath24 and @xmath27 is @xmath28 , defining the form factor @xmath29.,width=188 ]    solving the boltzmann - master equation in general is out of the question , even at the steady state . to make progress",
    ", a perturbative solution is necessary .",
    "since we expect that the rectification disappears in the limit of a macroscopic motor , a natural expansion parameter is the ratio of the mass @xmath6 of the gas particle over the mass @xmath30 of the object .",
    "more precisely , we have used @xmath31 as the expansion parameter .    introducing the transition probability @xmath32 with jump amplitude @xmath33 ,",
    "the boltzmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath34 the taylor expansion of the r.h.s . of this equation with respect to",
    "the jump amplitude leads to the equivalent kramers - moyal expansion : @xmath35 with jump moments @xmath36 , defined as : @xmath37    one can obtain from the kramers - moyal expansion the set of coupled equations for the moments of the velocity distribution @xmath38 .",

    "to lowest order in @xmath53 the first moment equation reduces to a closed equation featuring a linear relaxation law , namely : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 the linear friction coefficient , due to the section of the motor sitting in gas mixture @xmath1 : @xmath57 note that at this level of the perturbation , the steady state speed of the motor is zero : even though the motor may be constituted of asymmetric parts , no rectification takes place at the level of linear response .    at the next order in the perturbation , the first moment",
    "is coupled to the second one , which needs to be solved at lowest order . by doing so",
    ", one finds at the steady state : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the effective temperature given by : @xmath60 by inserting this result in the equation for the average velocity , one finds for the lowest order term of the steady state velocity @xmath61 : @xmath62 this speed is equal to the expansion parameter times the thermal speed of the motor and further multiplied by a factor that depends on the geometric properties of the object .",
    "note that the brownian motor ceases to function in the absence of a temperature difference ( when @xmath63 for all @xmath1 ) and in the macroscopic limit @xmath64 ( since @xmath65 ) .",
    "note also that the speed is scale - independent , i.e. , independent of the actual size of the motor units : @xmath61 is invariant under the rescaling @xmath26 to @xmath66 . in table",
    "[ tab : models ] we have collected the explicit result for @xmath61 for the four different thermal motors , depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : models ] .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the direction of the systematic speed on the basis of intuition .",
    "one can study the response of the motor by the application of an external force . due to the asymmetry",
    ", the response curve ( speed versus force ) will be asymmetric .",
    "in particular , it will require less force to move a triangle in the `` easy '' direction of the sharp angle .",
    "consequently , one expects that fluctuations leading to an `` extra force '' in the easy direction would be more successful in moving the object than the ones in the other direction . a similar argument",
    "can be applied to the discussion of the electric current in a diode , which also has an asymmetric response of current versus field .",
    "one expects that fluctuations in the electric field will produce a larger current in one direction than in the other one .",
    "however , as is well known @xcite , these arguments are clearly wrong .",
    "the first observation is that there is no systematic speed ( or electric current ) when the system is at equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the effect of possible asymmetries in a system are completely wiped out in equilibrium , as expressed explicitly in the principle of detailed balance discovered by onsager @xcite : at equilibrium any process and its time - reverse occur equally frequently .",
    "second , equilibrium is typically a so - called point of flux reversal @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of triangulita , the flux is in the `` easy '' direction of the sharp angle , only in the case when the temperature is lower in the reservoir containing the triangle .",
    "otherwise the speed is in the opposite direction .",
    "furthermore the speed again becomes zero when the temperature is zero in the reservoir containing the flat paddle .",
    "finally , the above mentioned asymmetry in the response appears in the nonlinear regime . in this regime , the dynamics of the various moments are however coupled . in particular , the equation for the average speed is not closed , but depends on the entire probability distribution . the nonlinear response to an external force is therefore not linked in an obvious way to the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics generated by nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "full information on the equation of the first moment is contained in the nonlinear function @xmath45 .",
    "it is reproduced in figures [ fig : a1](a ) and [ fig : a1](b ) for the motor units used in the constructions of fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . however , the direction of motion , to lowest order in @xmath53 , contains much less information . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : general ] ) , one finds for a motor with @xmath67 units : @xmath68.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the direction of the average speed does not depend on the densities of the gases or the size of the motor units .",
    "the quantity @xmath69 is a measure for the sharpness of the unit : @xmath70 on the other hand the quantity @xmath71 is proportional to the linear friction coefficient , cf .",
    "( [ gammageneral ] ) . for a bar of zero width , it has the minimal value @xmath72 when the bar is oriented horizontally , while it is maximal ( @xmath73 ) for a vertical bar .",
    ".analytic result for the lowest order contribution to @xmath74 for the different constructions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the resulting efficiency of the thermal engine at maximum power is then given by : @xmath75 one can immediately deduce from eqs .",
    "( [ gammageneral ] ) and ( [ eq : general ] ) , that the efficiency @xmath76 is very low , due to a prefactor @xmath77 : for small @xmath77 the heat conductivity is the dominant factor and both the rectified motion and resulting work are a second order effect .",
    "this observation is of course restricted to our discussion of the small @xmath53 limit .",
    "in fact much higher efficiencies can be in principle be achieved when one moves away from this limit @xcite .    since the expression for the efficiency of an arbitrary motor , eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) , is rather complex , we have reproduced the efficiency for the models of fig .",
