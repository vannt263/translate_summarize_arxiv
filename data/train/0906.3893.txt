    "this idea is supported further by the recent discovery of the first collisional family in the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "haumea ( also known as @xmath4 ) , one of the largest kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , is thought to have undergone a giant impact that gave rise to haumea s rapid rotation with a spin period of only 4 hours @xcite and that created its multiple satellite system @xcite and collisional family @xcite .",
    "the family of kbos ( 1995 sm@xmath5 , 1996 to@xmath6 , 1999 oy@xmath7 , 2002 tx@xmath8 , 2003 op@xmath9 , 2003 uz@xmath10 , 2005 cb@xmath11 , 2005 rr@xmath12 ) was linked to haumea because its members display surface properties and orbits similar to those of haumea .",
    "it has been proposed that this family of kbos are collisional fragments of the ejected ice mantel of haumea that were produced and ejected in haumea s giant impact @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion between the family members is only @xmath13 m/s which is unusually small for fragments of disruptive impacts which should typically be ejected with a velocity comparable to the escape velocity ( i.e. @xmath14 m/s for haumea ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations suggest that high velocity giant impacts lead to either the formation of disk of satellites or the dispersion of collisional fragments .",
    "the simultaneous creation of multiple satellites and the dispersion of collisional fragments has not been seen @xcite ; one should bear in mind , however , that none of the simulations tried to specifically explain haumea s giant impact .",
    "in this paper we propose and discuss a different formation scenario for the origin of haumea s collisional family . in our scenario",
    "the family members are ejected while in orbit around haumea . ejecting the family members while in orbit around haumea",
    "has the advantage that it naturally gives rise to a lower velocity dispersion among the family members than a direct ejection of fragments from haumea s surface and , in addition , it aids in explaining haumea s initial giant impact .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ 5s1 ]",
    "we introduce our definitions and assumptions .",
    "we give a detailed account of our model for the formation of haumea s collisional family in  [ 5s2 ] .",
    " [ 5s3 ] is concerned with haumea s giant impact .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  [ 5s4 ] .",
    "the haumea family currently consists of haumea and eight additional kbos .",
    "the family members have typically an eccentricity of @xmath15 and an inclination of @xmath16 .",
    "the actual masses of the family members are uncertain since haumea is the only object in its family with a measured albedo .",
    "haumea s visible albedo is with about @xmath17 @xcite among the highest in the solar system .",
    "in addition , lower limits for the visible geometric albedo of family members @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 were determined to be @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite respectively . given the common origin of the haumea family and their similar surface characteristics with",
    "strong water ice absorption features it is likely that the family members have , like haumea , high albedo surfaces @xcite .",
    "we will therefore assume that all family members have an albedo similar to that of haumea and we calculate the masses of the family members from absolute magnitudes from @xcite and references within .",
    "estimates from current kuiper belt surveys yield for the mass surface density @xmath24 for kbos of @xmath25 in size @xcite .",
    "we use this value of @xmath26 , assuming that no 100 km sized objects were lost from the kuiper belt after it was dynamically excited .",

    "our formation scenario for haumea s collisional family can be divided into three steps .",
    "first , haumea suffers a large collision .",
    "this collision gives rise to haumea s fast , @xmath41 hour spin period and ejects material that accumulates into a tightly bound satellite around haumea .",
    "second , the newly formed satellite undergoes tidal evolution that increases its orbital separation from haumea .",
    "third , the satellite suffers a destructive collision with an unbound kbo which creates and ejects the collisional family ( see fig.[5fig1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the typical velocity dispersion of the family will be of the order of the escape velocity from the satellite which is @xmath42 as will be shown below .    starting with a tightly bound satellites around haumea , the tidal evolution timescale for a satellite of mass , @xmath39 , to evolve from an initial separation of a few times haumea s radius , @xmath43 , to a separation @xmath44",
    "is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the orbital velocity of the satellite with semi - major axis , @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is the tidal dissipation function and @xmath49 the tidal love number of haumea .",
    "we refer the reader to table 1 for the definitions of the remaining symbols .",
    "the satellite suffers a destructive collision with unbound kbos at a rate @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radius of the ` bullet ' that can break up the satellite by collisions .",
    "the initial satellite needs to have been at least as large as all the identified family members combined ( including hiiaka and namaka but with the exclusion of haumea ) which yields a satellite radius of @xmath52 km . bodies of this size are predominantly held together by their own gravity .",
    "we can estimate the bullet size needed for satellite - break - up by considering energy and momentum conservation of the shock that propagates from the impact point to the antipode of the target . since energy and momentum conservation represent two limiting cases for impact processes @xcite",
    "; we estimate the range of bullet sizes needed for satellite - break - up to be @xmath53 where the lower limit is derived by requiring that the kinetic energy of the bullet be equal to the total gravitational energy of the target and the upper limit results from conservation of momentum .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed derivation and discussion of these two destruction criteria for strengthless bodies . evaluating equation ( [ 5e33 ] ) yields bullet sizes of @xmath54 . substituting expression ( [ 5e33 ] ) into equation ( [ 5e32 ] )",
    "we find that the typical timescale for haumea s satellite to suffer a destructive collision is @xmath55 .",
    "the timescale for satellite - break - up by a collision and the consequential formation of the family ranges therefore from a few to tens of gyrs .",
    "the actual @xmath56 is most likely closer to the tens of gyrs since the majority of the binaries in the kuiper belt should have been destroyed by collisions otherwise .",
    "this , therefore , implies a probability for a haumea - type family forming event of @xmath57 over the age of the solar system .",
    "estimates of the current kuiper belt population indicate that there should be about 10 objects with radii as larger as haumea @xcite .",
    "the abundance of haumea - sized objects and the ubiquity of collisionally formed satellites around the largest kbos @xcite makes our formation scenario consistent with having one collisional family for haumea - sized objects in the kuiper belt .",
    "however , we expect additional collisional families that are associated with smaller parent bodies .",
    "for example , we estimate that there are about 300 bodies in the kuiper belt with sizes similar to that of the initial haumea satellite . given our estimated satellite destruction probability of about 10%",
    "we expect , to an order of magnitude , about @xmath58 30 collisional families that originated from @xmath58 260  km parent bodies .",
    "these families , however , would be harder to find without a larger haumea - type object and might lack any unique spectral signatures that led to the identification of the haumea family .",
    "the typical velocity dispersion between the family members that are produced in the satellite - break - up discussed above is of the order of the escape velocity of the initial satellite . for a satellite radius of @xmath59 and a density of @xmath60",
    "we have an escape velocity from the satellite , @xmath61 , of @xmath62 .",
    "simulations of disruptive impacts on ice and basalt targets find typical ejection velocities of @xmath63 for the largest remnant and impact velocities of 3km / s @xcite .",
    "it could therefore be that the actual velocity dispersion of the family from a disruptive impact is somewhat smaller than the @xmath64 m/s estimated here .",
    "finally one needs to compare the escape velocity from the satellite , @xmath61 , with its orbital velocity around haumea , @xmath46 .",
    "a satellite - break - up only leads to ejection from the haumea system , and therefore to the formation of a collisional family , if the tidal evolution has increased the orbital separation of the satellite such that @xmath65 .",
    "we need to estimate the tidal love number , @xmath49 , for haumea in order to evaluate the orbital evolution timescale .",
    "we infer from haumea s density of @xmath66 that it must be mainly composed of rock . using the rigidity of basalt rock , @xmath67 @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the effective rigidity given by @xmath70 .",
    "evaluating the tidal evolution timescale in equation ( [ 5e31 ] ) we find that the timescale for the semi - major axis to increase such that @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "the satellite therefore has sufficient time to undergo tidal evolution that increases its semi - major axis such that @xmath73 before it suffers a destructive collision .",
    "due to the long collision timescale , the satellite will most likely undergo tidal evolution for @xmath74 gyr before it is broken apart .",
    "this yields a satellite separation from haumea at the time of the satellite break up of @xmath75 .",
    "haumea s spin angular momentum provides an upper limit on the mass of the initial satellite that was later broken up into the family members . assuming no angular momentum was added to the system after the giant impact and that haumea was initially spinning close to break up , we find a maximum satellite orbital angular momentum of @xmath76 . for a destructive satellite collision at an orbital separation of @xmath77",
    "this yields a satellite mass of @xmath78 .",
    "our formation scenario , therefore , predicts that the total mass of all the family members combined should not exceed @xmath79 of the mass of haumea or about 3 times the mass of the @xmath80 satellite considered in the calculation for the family forming event above .    in summary",
    ", we propose that haumea suffered a giant impact that leads to the formation of a large , @xmath81 km radius , satellite .",
    "tidal evolution increases the semi - major axis of the satellite such that @xmath65 in @xmath82 years .",
    "the satellite suffers a destructive collision with an unbound kbo .",
    "this collision breaks the satellite into the different family members and ejects them from the haumea system .",
    "this results in a typical velocity dispersion among the family members of @xmath64 m/s .",
    "we propose that hiiaka and namaka are remnants of this collision that did not escape from the haumea system .",
    "the destructive satellite collision that leads to the formation of the haumea family has a collision timescale of several tens of gyrs which makes our formation scenario consistent with having one collisional family for haumea - sized objects in the kuiper belt .",
    "one can imagine that haumea s initial giant impact did not generate just one but several tightly bound satellites .",
    "the newly formed satellites undergo tidal evolution that increases their orbital separation from haumea .",
    "once the orbital separation is sufficiently large , the majority of the satellites become gravitationally unbound from haumea due to collisions with small , unbound kbos . in this case , the typical velocity dispersion of the family will be of the order of the orbital velocity around haumea before ejection which we show is @xmath83 .",
    "the rate at which a given satellite suffers collisions with unbound kbos is given by equation ( [ 5e32 ] ) .",
    "the satellite sizes and impactor size needed to eject a satellite by collion however differ from that required for satellite destruction in the previous section . in a given collision ,",
    "the velocity change of the satellite is given by the conservation of linear momentum , @xmath84 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath85 accounts for the final momentum of the impactor .",
    "if the unbound kbo is perfectly reflected @xmath86 .",
    "momentum loss from an impact crater can lead to @xmath87 where the exact value of @xmath85 depends on the properties of the colliding bodies @xcite .",
    "since we are primarily concerned with deriving an order of magnitude estimate for the impactor size we will adopt @xmath88 for the rest of this paper .",
    "a satellite of haumea can be ejected by a collision with an unbound kbo if it suffers a velocity change @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , in order to be ejected , a satellite needs to collide with a kbo that typically has a radius of @xmath90 .    substituting this expression for @xmath51 into equation ( [ 5e32 ] )",
    "we have find that the ejection timescale for haumea s satellites by a collision with an unbound kbo is given by @xmath91 for the ejection of haumea s satellites by collisions with unbound kbos to be the typical outcome we need @xmath92 since otherwise most of the satellites should have remained bound to haumea which is contradicted by observations of the haumea family . equating the tidal evolution and ejection timescales allows us to derive the typical velocity with which the family members left the haumea system . equating equations ( [ 5e31 ] ) and ( [ 5e35 ] ) and solving for @xmath46 we have @xmath93^{1/14 } \\sim 120\\rm{m / s}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath94 and @xmath95 g ( i.e. @xmath96 ) to estimate @xmath46 . evaluating equation ( [ 5e36 ] ) for the various masses of the family members we find that @xmath46 ranges from @xmath97 to @xmath98 with a typical value of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , haumea s satellites will be ejected from the haumea system by collisions with unbound kbos once their orbital velocity around haumea is @xmath100 m/s .",
    "this will also be roughly , the expected velocity dispersion between family members which is in good agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "evaluating both the collisional and tidal evolution timescale using @xmath101 we find from equations ( [ 5e35 ] ) and ( [ 5e31 ] ) that the typical ejection timescale is @xmath102 .",
    "the ejection timescales for the various masses of the family members are all tens of gyrs and therefore exceed the age of the solar system .",
    "our calculation here can only estimate the ejection timescale to an oder of magnitude , it might therfore be that the actual ejection timescale is somewhat shorter than estimate here .",
    "in addition , we might have underestimated the number of unbound kbos that can lead to the ejection of family members since we extrapolated the surface density of 100 km sized bodies to smaller sizes assuming a power - law index @xmath103 of 4 whereas the actual power - law index might be a little larger than this .",
    "since this second formation scenario for the haumea family involves the ejection of all the family members separately the ejection process can not be a rare event .",
    "the ejection timescales therefore need to be shorter than the age of the solar system for this formation scenario to be feasible .",
    "this however raises a different problem .",
    "if the ejection timescales are indeed shorter than the age of the solar system , then most of the binaries in the kuiper belt should have been broken apart by the same process .",
    "this is in contradiction with the observations and we therefore conclude that formation of the haumea family by a destructive collision of a single satellite is the preferred scenario .",
    "in addition to problems discussed above , this second scenario faces yet another challenge . if the initial giant impact of haumea produced several satellites then satellite - satellite interactions need to be taken into account .",
    "the timescale for satellite ejection due to satellite - satellite interactions is @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "this timescale is very short ( i.e. @xmath105 for @xmath106 and a 10 day satellite orbit ) .",
    "initially , however , @xmath107 which implies that the satellites tend to collide with each other rather than eject each other from the system .",
    "satellite - satellite collisions may either lead to accretion or break up . in either case",
    "it is questionable whether several satellites can survive and tidally evolve outwards such that they could be ejected by collisions with unbound kbos .",
    "satellite - satellite interactions are therfore yet another reason to favor our first scenario in which a single satellite is created and broken apart .    as an alternative to ejecting the satellites by collisions with unbound kbos",
    ", one can imagine that the satellites could have been removed from the haumea system by gravitational scattering of passing kbos .",
    "however , in the high velocity regime discussed here ( @xmath108 ) , the rate of satellite ejection due the gravitational scattering is much less than that due to direct impacts of unbound kbos onto the satellites .",
    "see @xcite for comparison of collisional and gravitational evolution of binaries .",
    "@xcite estimate that haumea s radius before its giant impact was @xmath109 km and that the impactor was @xmath110 km in radius .",
    "the timescale for such an impact to occur in todays kuiper belt can be found from equation ( [ 5e32 ] ) which yields a collision timescale of @xmath111 years when evaluated for @xmath112 km and @xmath113 km .",
    "such a collision is therefore extremely unlikely but needed if one wants to form and eject the family directly form the giant impact . @xcite",
    "propose a giant impact scenario for haumea that circumvents this low probability by requiring a collision between two scattered disk objects assuming that the scattered disk was a 100 times more massive than it is today . in our formation scenario haumea",
    "can suffer its giant impact before the kuiper belt was dynamically excited which shortens the collision timescale significantly .",
    "the timescale for haumea s giant impact in the sub - hill velocity regime is @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is haumea s hill radius .",
    "therefore , allowing haumea s giant impact to occur while the kuiper belt was still dynamically cold decreases the giant impact timescale by 6 orders of magnitude , even without enhancing the mass surface density in the kuiper belt above its estimated current value .",
    "we therefore propose that haumea s initial giant impact occurred while the velocity dispersion of large kbos was still in the sub - hill regime .",
    "this is supported by the ubiquity of small , collisionally formed satellites around kbos , which have radii as large as 1000 km @xcite and the pluto - charon system @xcite which strongly suggests that sub - hill kbo velocities prevailed during satellite formation and that collisional satellite formation was common , especially around the largest kbos .",
    "the satellite , which we propose forms in haumea s giant impact , is initially tightly bound to haumea and the long tidal evolution timescale ensures that the haumea - satellite system remains intact until after the dynamical excitation of the kuiper belt .",
    "the family members are created and ejected from the haumea system only after the dynamical excitation of the kuiper belt which ensures the dynamical coherence of the family members .",
    "this scenario , therefore , does not face the potential challenge of removing 99% of the mass in the scattered disk without destroying the dynamical coherence of the family .",
    "we propose a new formation scenario for the haumea family . in our scenario",
    "haumea s giant impact forms a single moon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision from which the family is created .",
    "the advantage of this scenarios is that it naturally gives rise to a lower velocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection from haumea s surface .",
    "we show that this formation scenarios yields a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 among the family members .",
    "this is in good agreement with the measured dispersion @xmath13 m/s in semi - major axis , eccentricity , and inclination of the family members @xcite which is a lower limit of the actual velocity dispersion since the orbital angles were chosen to minimize the velocity dispersion of the family @xcite .",
    "our formation scenario yields about one collisional family for haumea - sized objects in the kuiper belt . ejecting the family members from haumea s orbit has the additional advantage that it is easy to reconcile with haumea s initial giant impact .",
    "the family must have been ejected from haumea after the kuiper belt was dynamically excited in order to preserve the dynamical coherence of the family .",
    "if the family members are dispersed fragments of the giant impact itself then , the giant impact must have occurred after the kuiper belt was dynamically excited .",
    "such a giant impact occurs with a probably of less than @xmath117 over the age of the solar system and is therfore extremely unlikely in todays kuiper belt .",
    "@xcite suggest that haumea s giant impact could be the result of collision between two scattered disk objects during a phase when the scattered disk was a 100 times more massive than it is today . in our scenario , haumea s giant impact can occur before the dynamical excitation of the kuiper belt since the giant impact and the ejection of the family are two different events separated in time by at least @xmath82years .",
    "the timescale for haumea s giant impact in the sub - hill velocity regime is @xmath118 years .",
    "observations show that the majority of the largest kbos have small , collisionally formed satellites @xcite .",
    "giant impacts that lead to satellite formation around large kuiper belt objects were therefore common in the history of the kuiper belt and we propose that haumea s initial giant impact was one of them . our formation scenario is also in agreement with results from simulations of giant impacts since it only requires the formation of a satellite and not the simultaneous formation of satellites and direct ejection of fragments in a single collision @xcite which is required in the original formation scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the family members discussed above , haumea has also two satellites .",
    "the larger outer satellite ( @xmath119 ) has a semi - major axis of 49500 km and a free eccentricity of 0.07 @xcite .",
    "namaka , the smaller ( @xmath120 ) inner satellite , has a semi - major axis of 25700 km , a free eccentricity of 0.21 and its inclination with respect to hiiaka is @xmath121 @xcite . hiiaka and namaka display , just like all other family members , strong water ice absorption features in their infrared spectra @xcite . since this spectral signature seems to be only present among the family members it seems unlikely that hiiaka and namaka were captured",
    "; instead they most likely formed together with the other family members .",
    "it is unlikely that hiiaka and namaka evolved to their current separation by tides , since the tidal evolution timescales are excessively long . from equation ( [ 5e31 ] ) we have for hiiaka @xmath122 years and for namaka @xmath123 years where we used again @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "both timescales exceed the age of the solar system by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we suggest that hiiaka and namaka were produced in the same satellite - break - up that created the other family members , only that in their case the impulse was not sufficient to escape haumea but instead it increased their semi - major axis by a factor of @xmath126 to their current separation .",
    "such a collision will however also raise the eccentricity to order unity .",
    "is is possible that the satellites , especially hiiaka , formed by re - accumulation of collisional fragments of the satellite break up .",
    "such a re - accumulation scenario typically leads to more circular satellite orbits .",
    "we also note that hiiaka s free eccentricity of 0.07 is consistent with dynamical excitations by passing kbos @xcite .",
    "namaka , which is ten times less massive than hiiaka , could be a single collisional fragment of the satellite break up , hence its large free eccentricity of 0.21 .",
    "we therefore find that our formation scenario for haumea s family can account for the large semi - major axis and modest eccentricities of hiiaka and namaka .",
    "the @xmath127 mutual inclination between the two moons remains somewhat of a puzzle , since it is surprisingly high if the moons formed in a disk and tidally evolved outward and it is surprisingly low if the moons formed from fragments of a disruptive satellite collision as suggested in this paper .                    , m.  e. , bouchez , a.  h. , rabinowitz , d. , sari , r. , trujillo , c.  a. , van dam , m. , campbell , r. , chin , j. , hartman , s. , johansson , e. , lafon , r. , le mignant , d. , stomski , p. , summers , d. , & wizinowich , p. 2005",
