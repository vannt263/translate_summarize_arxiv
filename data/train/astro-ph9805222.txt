    "the reader is referred to pols & marinus ( 1994 ) for a more detailed discussion account of the binary evolution code .      in general ,",
    "the evolution of a binary is determined by the initial masses of the two stars ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , the initial semi - major axis ( @xmath19 ) and the initial eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) of the binary at zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "we construct monte carlo ensembles of high - mass protobinary systems ( with primary masses between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) by drawing from an initial distribution of each of the four parameters as prescribed and motivated in portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) .",

    "we ignore the effect of gravitational radiation and magnetic braking in the early stages of binary evolution .",
    "the simple approximation of the 4-parameter distribution function , albeit rather _ ad hoc _ , appears to adequately reproduce the observed population of lower mass stars in clusters ( eg .  pols & marinus 1994 ) .",
    "the effect on the distribution of ns ",
    "ns binaries after the second supernova by variation of the 4-parameter space is certainty of interest , but we have used the canonical values . a fair level of robustness is noted in that varying the limits of the initial distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 does not the change the implied birthrates of bound ns binaries nearly as much as plausible variation in asymmetric kick distribution .",
    "this effect was noted in portegies zwart & spreeuw 1995 and portegies zwart & verbunt 1995 .",
    "several authors ( eg .  paczyski 1990 ; narayan & ostriker 1990 ; lyne & lorimer 1994 ; cordes & chernoff 1997 ) have sought to constrain the distribution of an asymmetric kick velocities from observations of isolated pulsars which are the presumed by - products of type ii supernovae . even careful modeling of the selection effects in observing such pulsars has yielded derived mean velocities that differ by nearly an order of magnitude . it is important here to use a good estimate for the actual physical impulse ( the `` kick velocity '' ) the neutron stars receive on formation .",
    "the observed distribution of pulsar velocities does not reflect the kick distribution directly as it includes the blaauw kick ( blaauw 1961 ) from those pulsars formed in binaries , and selection effects on observing both the high and low speed tail of the pulsar population ( eg .",
    "hartman 1997 ) .",
    "hansen & phinney ( 1997 ) found that the observed distribution is adequately fit by a maxwellian velocity distribution with @xmath25 km s@xmath5 ( which corresponds to a 3-d mean velocity of  300 km s@xmath5 ) . since it is not clear that pulsar observations require a more complicated kick - velocity distribution",
    ", we chose to adopt a maxwellian but vary the value of @xmath26 .",
    "when a member of the binary undergoes a supernovae we assume the resulting ns receives a velocity kick , @xmath27 , drawn from this distribution .",
    "although the direction of this kick may be coupled to orientation of the binary plane , we choose a kick with a random spatial direction , since there is no known correlation between the kick direction or magnitude and the binary parameters .    with an angle @xmath28 between the velocity kick and the relative velocity vector , @xmath29 , of the two stars .",
    "then , following earlier formulae ( e.g.  portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ; wettig & brown 1996 ) , the new - semi major axis of the binary is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the instantaneous distance between the two stars before sn , @xmath32 is the mass of the companion ( which may already be a ns ) , and @xmath33 is the mass of the resulting neutron star .",

    "if @xmath34 is positive , the new eccentricity is @xmath35^{1/2}~ , \\label{eq : e}\\ ] ] where the resultant relative velocity is @xmath36 . assuming the kick directions between successive sn are independent",
    ", the resulting kick to the bound system ( whose magnitude is given by equation [ 2.10 ] of brant & podsiadlowski 1995 ) is added in quadrature to the initial system velocity to give the system velocity ( @xmath37 ) .    to produce 1082 bound ns ",
    "ns binaries with a hansen & phinney kick velocity distribution and initial conditions described above , we follow the evolution of 9.7 million main sequence binaries which produce a total of @xmath38 1 million neutron stars through supernovae . assuming a supernova rate of 1 per 40 years ( tammann et al .",
    "1994 ) and 40% binary fraction ( as in portegies zwart & spreeuw 1996 ) , we find an implied birthrate of ns",
    " ns binaries by computing the number of binaries with sn type ii per year and multiply by the ratio of bound ns ",
    "ns systems to sn type ii as found in the simulations .",

    "we take the disk scale and halo scale to vary independently in our galactic models .",
    "we assume the ns ",
    "ns binaries are born in an exponential stellar disk , with birthplace drawn from randomly from mass distribution of the disk .",
    "the initial velocity is the local circular velocity ( characterized but the halo ) plus @xmath37 added with random orientation .",
    "we then integrate the motion of the binary in the galactic potential assuming a hernquist ( 1990 ) halo ; we ignore the contribution of the disk to the potential .",
    "we assume scale lengths for the disk and halo , the disk scale ( @xmath39 ) determines the disk distribution , the halo scale length ( @xmath40 ) and circular velocity ( @xmath41 ) determine the halo mass ( see table 1 ) . the movement of the ns ",
    "ns binaries on long time - scales is sensitive primarily to the depth of the galactic potential ( here assumed to be halo dominated ) and how quickly it falls off at large radii .",
    "assuming isothermal halos instead of hernquist profiles would decrease the fraction of ns ",
    "ns pairs that move to large galactocentric radii , but the differences in distribution are dominated by the true depth of the halo potentials in which the stars form rather than their density profiles at large radii .",
    "we use a symplectic leapfrog integrator to advance the binary in the galactic potential , and a simple iteration scheme to evolve the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary as gravitational radiation drives @xmath42 and @xmath43 to zero , assuming the orbit averaged quadrupole dominated approximation ( peters 1964 ) .",
    "the integration is continued until either @xmath44 years have passed ( no merger in hubble time ) or the characteristic time to merger is short compared to the dynamical time scale of the binary in the halo ( ie .  the binary wo nt move any further before it merges ) .",
    "we then record the 3-d position of the binary relative to the presumptive parent galaxy and the time since formation .",

    "approximately half of the ns ",
    "ns binaries merge within @xmath72 years after the second sn ; this merger time is relatively quick on the timescale of star - formation .",

    "these angular offsets can be considered the extreme of the expected radial distribution since the potentials are weakest and we have not included the effect of projection .",

    "given the agreement of our orbital parameter distribution ( figure 1 ) and velocity distribution ( figure 2 ) with that of portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) , the discrepancy between the derived spatial distribution ( see figure 8 of portegies zwart & yungelson ) is likely due to our use of a galactic potential in the model .",

    "although the ns  ns birthrate decreases with increased velocity kick , the distribution of merger time and system velocity is not affected strongly by our choice of kick distributions .",
    "rather , the shapes of the orbital and velocity distributions ( figures 1 and 2 ) are closely connected with the pre - sn orbital velocity , which is itself connected simply with the evolution and masses .",
    "that is , bound ns binaries come from a range of parameters which give high orbital velocities in the pre - second sn system .",
    "the orbital parameters ( and merger time distribution ) of binaries which survive the second sn are not sensitive to the exact kick - velocity distribution .",
    "we suspect this may be because bound systems can only originate from a parameter space where the kick magnitude and orientation are tuned for the pre - second sn orbital parameters .",
    "the overall fraction of systems that remain bound _ is _ sensitive to the kick distribution insofar as the kick distribution determines how many kicks are in the appropriate range of parameter space .    since ns ",
    "ns binaries are formed rapidly ( with an average time since zams of @xmath83 million years ) and the median merger time is of order one hundred million years regardless of the kick velocity distribution ( see table 2 ) , the rate of ns ",
    "ns mergers should closely trace the star formation rate . in the context of gamma - ray bursts , where merging nss",
    "are seen as the canonical production mechanism , this result implies that the grb merger rate should evolve proportionally to the star formation rate ( see figure [ fig : sfr ] ; see also bagot , portegies zwart , & yungelson 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , several studies ( totani 1997 ; lipunov , postnov , & prokhorov 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ) have consistently fit the grb log @xmath11log @xmath12 curve to a model which assumes such a rate density evolution .",
    "if indeed gamma - ray bursts arise from the coalescence of neutron star binaries , then we confirm that grbs should trace the star formation rate in the universe ; thus most grbs should have redshifts near the peak in star formation ( currently believed to be @xmath84 ; madau et al .",
    "1996 ) although the observed distribution may be skewed to lower redshifts by obscuration at high redshift ( eg .  hughes et al .",
