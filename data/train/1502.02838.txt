    "string theories have been developed , seeking to produce a consistent description of the standard model of physics including the phenomenon of gravity , which appear to be most consistent if large numbers of dimensions are postulated . a 26-dimensional space - time was deemed necessary for bosonic strings  @xcite and a ten - dimensional one for type - ii  @xcite and heterotic strings  @xcite .",
    "the latter theories are closely related to a mysterious theory called m - theory , which lives in 11 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , classical physics requires 3 spatial dimensions , e.g. to accommodate newton s inverse square law as argued already by immanuel kant .",
    "ehrenfest has shown that atoms only exhibit stable orbits in a 3-dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "these contradictions between requirements from classical and quantum physics for a 3-dimensional space and the possibility of a theory involving higher dimensions were already resolved in 1926 by klein invoking the concept of compactification  @xcite .    in the present study the accurate results from precision measurements on molecules",

    "great progress has also been made on the calculation of level energies in the neutral hydrogenic molecules .",
    "accurate born - oppenheimer energies have been calculated for the electronic ground state of h@xmath0 , hd and d@xmath0  @xcite , as well as non - adiabatic interactions  @xcite and relativistic and quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) corrections  @xcite .",
    "now a full set of ro - vibrational level energies of all quantum states up to the dissociation limit is available for all three isotopomers  @xcite .",
    "these calculations on the ground electronic quantum levels were tested in experiments measuring the dissociation limits of h@xmath0  @xcite , d@xmath0  @xcite , and hd  @xcite .",

    "the results from the variety of experimental precision measurements on both the ionic and neutral hydrogen molecules are generally in excellent agreement with the qed - calculations , within combined uncertainty limits from theory and experiment .    the agreement between experiment and first - principles calculations on quantum level energies of molecules has inspired an interpretation of these data that goes beyond molecular physics . since weak , strong and ( newtonian ) gravitational forces have negligible contributions to their quantum level structure , electromagnetism is the sole force acting between the charged particles within light molecules , and qed is the fully - encompassing framework to perform calculations .",
    "this makes it possible to derive bounds on possible fifth forces between hadrons from molecular precision experiments compared with qed - calculations  @xcite .    theories of higher dimensions were developed with the goal to resolve the hierarchy problem , i.e. the vast difference of scales between that of electro - weak unification ( 1 tev ) and that of the planck scale ( 10@xmath7 tev ) , where gravity becomes strong . by permitting the leakage of gravity into higher dimensions while keeping the particles and the three forces of the standard model in 3 + 1 dimensions , and invoking a compactification range for the extra dimensions exceeding 3 + 1 , two different testable theories were phrased by arkhani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite and by randall and sundrum  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical formalisms of these theories can be applied to molecular physics test bodies , from which constraints on the compactification distances can be deduced for the former , while constraints on the brane separation or curvature can be derived for the latter .",

    "it is the intention of the theory formulated by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite , referred to as add - theory , to establish an effective planck scale to coincide with the electro - weak scale by allowing gravity to propagate in extra dimensions .",
    "the three forces of the standard model , tested at very short distances in particle and atomic physics experiments , are considered to act locally within a 3-brane ( 3 spatial dimensions and a time dimension ) embedded in a higher dimensional bulk , where gravity may act allowing for gravitons to escape . by this means in",
    "add the hierarchy problem is nullified , and the so - called desert range between the electro - weak scale ( @xmath8 ) of 1 tev and the planck scale ( @xmath9 ) of 10@xmath7 tev avoided .",
    "the extension of the extra dimensions is necessarily limited , in the case of flat metrics considered in add , since experiments of the cavendish - type have proven that gravity obeys the newtonian @xmath10 potential beyond the range of 1 cm @xcite . hence , the extra dimensions are considered to be compactified within a range parameter @xmath11 . while in principle the extra dimensions could exhibit differing range parameters , in the add - formalism and in the present analysis such difference is not made .",

    "we adopt the natural units @xmath14 and drop the @xmath15-factor in the potentials .",
    "the extra @xmath16 spatial dimensions proposed in the add theory result in a modification of newtonian gravity , for distances shorter than the compactification length range , that is consistent with gauss law : @xmath17 where the subscript 4 represents the known @xmath18 spacetime dimensions , and @xmath19 is the full higher - dimensional planck mass . for separations larger than the compactification length , @xmath20 , the add potential should be in correspondence with the newtonian @xmath10-form @xmath21 to be more precise , @xmath22 should be the compactified volume of the extra dimensions @xmath23 , thus a factor of order unity might be included for a specific compactification geometry .    the planck mass @xmath9 is then related to the higher - dimensional mass @xmath19 via : @xmath24 thus the fundamental mass @xmath19 may still be small and @xmath9 becomes large due to the compactified volume of extra dimensions .",

    "the warped metric differentiates the rs models from the add model with a flat metric where @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the exponential warp factor in the rs scenarios solves the hierarchy problem alternatively , without requiring large extra dimensions as assumed in the add model .    in the rs scenarios the modified gravitational potential between two masses separated by a distance @xmath38 in the sm - brane can be expressed as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the correction to the newtonian potential .",

    "<S> based on the molecular spectroscopy of d@xmath0 molecules and hd@xmath2 ions , the compactification size for seven extra dimensions ( in connection to m - theory defined in 11 dimensions ) of equal size is shown to be limited to @xmath3 m . while limits on compactification sizes of extra dimensions based on other branches of physics are compared , the prospect of further tightening constraints from the molecular method is discussed .    </S>",
