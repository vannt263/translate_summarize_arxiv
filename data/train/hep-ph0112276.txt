    "triggered by the measurement of the proton s spin - dependent deep - inelastic structure function @xmath2 by the emc  @xcite more than a decade ago , combined experimental and theoretical efforts have led to an improved understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "in particular , we have gained some fairly precise information concerning the total quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin . the most prominent `` unknown '' is the elusive , yet unmeasured spin - dependent gluon density , @xmath1 . hence current and future experiments designed to further unravel the spin structure of the nucleon focus strongly on the issue of constraining @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , information will soon be gathered for the first time at the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of the rhic spin program  @xcite is to hunt down @xmath1 by measuring double spin asymmetries in longitudinally polarized @xmath0 collisions at high energies .",
    "rhic is particularly suited for this task , since the gluon density is expected to participate dominantly in many different production processes .",
    "this is in contrast to deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering where the gluon enters only as a small correction in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd and indirectly via the renormalization group evolution of the parton densities .",
    "along with the production of prompt photons and jets with high transverse momentum @xmath3 , heavy flavor pair creation is one of the most promising candidates at rhic to study @xmath4 over a broad range of the momentum fraction @xmath5 and scale @xmath6 . by virtue of the factorization theorem",
    "@xcite , helicity densities extracted from different processes should match .",
    "this important universality property , exploited in `` global '' fits of parton densities , can also be tested at rhic .    in the lowest order ( lo ) in the strong coupling @xmath7 , heavy flavor pair production in hadron - hadron collisions",
    "proceeds through two parton - parton subprocesses , @xmath8 gluon - gluon fusion is known to be the by far dominant mechanism for charm and bottom production in the unpolarized case in all experimentally relevant regions of phase space @xcite .",
    "this feature , true also in the polarized case unless @xmath1 is exceedingly small , makes heavy quark production a particularly suited tool to study the gluon density . however , nlo qcd corrections to the lo subprocesses in eq .",
    "( [ eq : loproc ] ) have to be included for a reliable description .",
    "first and foremost this is due to the strong dependence of the lo results on unphysical theoretical conventions such as the factorization scale , which reflects the amount of arbitrariness in the separation of short- and long - distance physics .",
    "in addition , the size of the nlo corrections turns out be quite sizable and not uniform in , e.g. , the @xmath3 of one of the heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the latter feature rules out the use of any approximations as estimates of the complete nlo corrections .",
    "the computation of the nlo corrections are fairly involved since one has to keep track of the mass of the heavy quark , @xmath9 , throughout the calculation .",
    "massless approximations are bound to fail at small - to - medium values of @xmath3 where @xmath10 and the cross section is large .",
    "so far only unpolarized nlo results had been available , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the differential and total cross sections , respectively . polarized lo",
    "expressions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the complete nlo results are presented for the first time in this work .    apart from calculational difficulties , a further complication arises when one tries to match theoretical parton - level results for heavy flavor production rates with experimental ones .",
    "experiments can only observe the remains of heavy quark ( meson ) decays  usually leptons . in practice",
    "they also have to impose cuts on these particles to insure a proper @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark separation and to take care of the , usually limited and non uniform , detector acceptance .",
    "one thus has to find a practical way to incorporate hadronization , lepton - level cuts , and the detector acceptance in an analysis based on parton - level calculations , since they can distort spin asymmetries if polarized and unpolarized cross sections are affected differently .",
    "this may lead to incorrect conclusions about @xmath1 .",
    "heavy flavor decays usually have multi - body kinematics making it difficult if not impossible to trace back cuts to the parton - level analytically .",
    "instead we propose to use `` efficiencies '' , to be defined below , for bins in @xmath3 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath13 of the heavy quark , to model its hadronization , decay , and crucial detector features .",
    "heavy flavor production at rhic is also interesting for reasons other than @xmath1 .",
    "there is a well - known , longstanding discrepancy between data from the tevatron collider for unpolarized open @xmath12 production and theory @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath12 rates in @xmath14 and @xmath15 collisions were also found to be in excess of theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the fact that open @xmath11 production seems to be fairly well described by theory makes these experimental findings even more puzzling , since perturbative qcd should be more reliable for the much heavier @xmath12 quark .",
    "this discrepancy for inclusive @xmath12 production has revived speculations about new physics .",
    "for instance , the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model can be tuned such that relatively light gluinos @xmath16 exclusively decay into even lighter ( s)bottom quarks @xmath17 and @xmath12 s : @xmath18 @xcite . in this way",
    "the yield of @xmath12 s is enhanced , and the tevatron data can be reproduced while still complying with direct supersymmetry searches and precision measurements in @xmath19 collisions @xcite . as will be briefly discussed below , our lo and nlo results for the dominant gluon - gluon fusion subprocess also contain the production of gluino pairs , @xmath20 , after adjusting the color factors appropriately subprocess receives new contributions absent in @xmath21 . ]",
    "thus one can also estimate the spin - dependent hadroproduction of ( light ) gluinos at rhic and at a conceivable polarized version of the cern lhc in the distant future .",
    "other explanations @xcite of the observed @xmath12 excess make use of unintegrated gluon distributions and @xmath22-factorization , however , nlo calculations in this framework are still lacking .",
    "if results from the just upgraded tevatron confirm the @xmath12 excess , rhic will play an important rle in deciphering the underlying mechanism since it allows to study the energy- _ and _ spin - dependence of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 production .",
    "finally , our results are also required for a fully consistent description of the polarized photoproduction of heavy quark pairs .",
    "apart from the `` direct '' process @xmath23 , where the nlo corrections have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ( quasi-)real photon can also resolve into its hadronic content before the hard scattering takes place .",
    "the introduction of photonic parton densities is mandatory for the factorization of mass singularities of the direct process associated with collinear @xmath24 , @xmath25 , splitting .",
    "polarized `` resolved '' photon processes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : loproc ] ) , have been estimated @xcite to be small for fixed target experiments like compass @xcite , but can be significant at proposed future polarized lepton - hadron colliders like the eic @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the outline and main results of our calculation . in section",
    "2 we give a brief description of the calculational steps and methods we have employed , in particular of the subtleties which arise due to the spin - dependence . in section",
    "3 we first discuss the different features of the nlo corrections to the polarized gluon - gluon fusion subprocess , always in comparison to the unpolarized case . next we demonstrate the significantly reduced dependence on unphysical renormalization and factorization scales in nlo qcd for heavy flavor production at rhic .",
    "we finish with studying the sensitivity of the heavy quark spin asymmetry to @xmath1 at rhic energies including realistic cuts on experimentally observable leptons from heavy quark decays .",
    "we conclude in section  4 .",
    "technical details and lengthy analytical results are omitted throughout and will be presented elsewhere @xcite along with further phenomenological applications .",

    "@xmath9 is also taken as in these fits , i.e. , @xmath177 for the modern and @xmath178 for the old spin - dependent densities .",
    "all results are obtained for the choice @xmath179 .",
    "it is immediately apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : casym ] that charm production at rhic can be very useful in pinning down @xmath1 .",
    "the estimated statistical error for such a measurement , @xmath180 , assuming a luminosity of @xmath181 and a beam polarization of @xmath182 @xcite is significantly smaller than the total spread of the predictions .",
    "this is true in particular if we take the large gs a @xcite @xmath1 into account , which is still compatible with recent data .",
    "the gs a asymmetry is so large that it had to be scaled down by 0.7 to fit well into the same plot .",
    "note that very small gluons , e.g. , the oscillating @xmath1 of gs c @xcite , are at the edge of being detectable .",
    "there are three groups of helicity densities which will be indistinguishable within the errors by charm production : grsv00 std .",
    "& ds i- , aac 1 & 2 , and ds iii+ & grsv96 std . & val .",
    "here the gluon densities are too similar in the range of @xmath5 predominantly probed by this process .",
    "we will map the range in @xmath5 where @xmath1 is accessible by heavy flavor production at rhic in detail in @xcite .",
    "=    finally we take a look at the importance of the nlo corrections for the heavy flavor spin asymmetry .",
    "[ fig : kfac ] shows the ratio of the charm spin asymmetries calculated in nlo ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : casym ] ) and lo for the range of modern helicity densities @xcite .",
    "one can infer that the nlo asymmetries are generally _ smaller _ than the lo ones by a factor of about three . in the case of the aac helicity densities @xcite we find an even larger suppression .",
    "furthermore , there is considerable dependence on @xmath183 , which will inhibit the use of constant `` k - factors '' to estimate the nlo results from lo ones .",
    "it should also be pointed out that much of the reduction of the asymmetry in nlo stems from the _ unpolarized _ cross section in nlo , which is about a factor two larger than the corresponding lo result .",
    "this is shown by the thin solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : kfac ] representing the ratio @xmath184 obtained with the grv98 parton densities @xcite .",
    "the sizable difference of the asymmetry predictions in lo and nlo means that the lo and nlo gluon helicity densities extracted from a future asymmetry measurement will differ considerably .",
    "whether this will be consistent with data from other processes has to studied in a global analysis , e.g. , along the lines suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "further studies of the uncertainties and predictions for bottom production will become available soon @xcite . there",
    "we will also present more details concerning the calculational techniques that have been used and analytical results for the matrix elements that we have obtained . in case one",
    "wants to extend our gluon - gluon results to the production of gluinos , one has to take into account the following colorfactor replacements in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mvgg ] ) and ( [ eq : mrgg ] ) , which already include the color - average : replace the prefactor @xmath185 and set @xmath186 inside the square brackets . before doing the latter , one has to use the identity @xmath187 for the _ kq _ parts , e.g. , @xmath188 .",
    "we note that one could use this identity anyway to rewrite the results with the same number of colorfactors , e.g. , @xmath189 , but this has numerical disadvantages due to the length of the expressions for @xmath190 and @xmath191 . for a complete nlo supersymmetric qcd calculation of spin - dependent gluino production one would have to take into account that the running of the strong coupling will be changed and that other subprocesses will contribute .",
    "however , as always , gluon - gluon scattering is expected to be the dominant subprocess .",
    "to summarize , we have presented the first complete nlo qcd calculation for the spin - dependent hadroproduction of heavy quarks .",
    "the nlo results have considerably less uncertainties stemming from variations of the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "they even become nearly independent of the scales when the conventional choice @xmath112 is employed .",
    "there remains , however , an uncertainty of @xmath192 of about @xmath193 from variations of the charm mass within a reasonable range . we have made predictions for the charm asymmetry that can be measured soon with the phenix experiment at rhic .",
    "these predictions include an efficiency function which describes hadronization , decays of the heavy quarks , experimental cuts , and the detector geometry . in this way it was demonstrated clearly that @xmath1 can be constrained considerably with heavy flavor production , even if current experimental limitations are taken into account realistically .",
    "finally , we have shown that as in the unpolarized case , lo calculations can not be substituted in any simple manner for the full nlo result .",
    "our work is of particular relevance also to the `` heavy quark enigma '' arising from discrepancies of unpolarized bottom , but not charm , production data with theory . on the one hand one",
    "now will be able to compare _ spin - dependent _ rhic data for charm and bottom production to a nlo prediction .",
    "on the other hand our calculation provides the major part of the spin - dependence of a possible `` new physics '' explanation of this discrepancy in terms of supersymmetry by a simple adjustment of colorfactors .",
    "more details and further phenomenological studies can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to m.  grosse perdekamp and j.  smith for helpful discussions .",
