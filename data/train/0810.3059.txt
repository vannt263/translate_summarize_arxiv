    "noncentrosymmetric heavy - fermion superconductors have recently triggered much theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "the family of li@xmath1b(pd@xmath4pt@xmath5)@xmath2 as well as the compounds cept@xmath2si and cerhsi@xmath2 are among the major examples .",
    "@xcite the lack of inversion symmetry of background crystal causes an unconventional pairing in the superconducting state and a number of consequences are predicted.@xcite it is commonly believed that in the normal state the fermi surface is split by the spin - orbital coupling as a result of the broken inversion symmetry , and the pairing wavefunction is in a mixture of singlet and triplet pseudospin state.@xcite suggested by the low temperature measurements of penetration depths , the family of li@xmath1b(pd@xmath4pt@xmath5)@xmath2 with point group symmetry @xmath0 demonstrates a trend from a conventional gap to a nodal gap caused by mixing with a stronger triplet pairing as the composition @xmath6 varies from 0 to 1.@xcite the conclusion that the li@xmath1pd@xmath2b compound is a fully gapped superconductor is consistent with other measurements such as nmr,@xcite specific heat,@xcite and muon spin rotation ( @xmath7sr ) measurements.@xcite the nodal gap structure of li@xmath1pt@xmath2b hinted by the penetration depth measurement , however , is controversial since the specific heat and @xmath7sr measurements suggest conventional pairing.@xcite    microscopically , the lack of inversion symmetry allows a parity - breaking spin - orbital interaction which leads to a magnetization induced by the phase gradient associated with the superconducting order parameter , and vice versa.@xcite for an ideally two - dimensional system , the phase gradient induced by the constant magnetic field , or the so - called helical phase , might be measured using a josephson junction between a conventional and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor.@xcite however , this scheme is not feasible when considering the decay of magnetic field in a real three - dimensional bulk superconductor . on the other hand , a unique and macroscopic distribution of magnetic field is generated inside the noncentrosymmetric superconductors due to the induced phase graident and magnetization.@xcite therefore , the measurement of the local field distribution , such as the @xmath7sr,@xcite can be used to detect the unconventional pairing .",
    "given the fact that these noncentrosymmetric compounds are strong type ii superconductors,@xcite the effects of lacking inversion symmetry on the vortex state are of importance .",
    "in this paper we focus on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors with point group symmetry @xmath0 , such as li@xmath1pt@xmath2b , where a distribution of transverse magnetic field is generated in addition to the ordinary field parallel with the vortex line.@xcite    in sec.[singlevtex ] , we first derive the magnetic distribution associated with an isolated vortex line .",
    "in particular , we note a singular bound current defined by the curl of magnetization appears within the vortex core .",
    "it appears because the magnetization here is proportional to the gradient of order parameter phase associated with the vortex state .",
    "hence a new boundary condition is necessary for the azimuthal field to balance the singular bound current , which was missing in our previous study,@xcite and it leads to a significant correction to this field . in sec.[lattice ] , we extend to the lattice and numerically obtain the tranverse field @xmath8 as well as the associated probability distribution @xmath9 . in sec.[conclusion ] we connect the present results with the proposed helical phase , and draw the conclusion in the end .",
    "inside a type ii conventional superconductor in the presence of external magnetic field , the abrikosov vortex state with a periodic distribution of internal magnetic field is developed when the applied field is larger than @xmath10 , below which a complete meissner effect occurs , and less than @xmath11 , beyond which the superconductivity only appears on the surface and completely disappear for further increased field .",
    "the internal magnetic field inside a conventional superconductor is parallel with the external one , whereas a transverse component is developed inside this noncentrosymmetric superconductor , as will be shown below .",
    "since the internal field for an isolated vortex is essential to the vortex lattice , below we first solve the single vortex case .",
    "consider a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with an isolated vortex line along the z direction .",
    "below the cylindrical coordinate @xmath12 is employed .",
    "we denote the order parameter associated with the single vortex as @xmath13 where the phase @xmath14=@xmath15 , that is the vortex is said to have the winding number of minus one . besides",
    ", the magnitude @xmath16 can be viewed as a constant for positions outside the vortex core that roughly has a size of coherence length @xmath17 .",
    "the internal local magnetic field @xmath18 is then determined by the supercurrent @xmath19 through the ampre s law ,    = 4 + ( -e)*j,[max1 ] where the first term on the right represents the bound current due to the magnetization @xmath20 , which is zero for conventional superconductors .",
    "the electric charge has been written as @xmath21 . here",
    "the nonzero @xmath20 is proportional to the phase gradient,@xcite namely , *    4= ( * a*+)[magnetization ] , where @xmath22 is the london penetration depth , @xmath23 has the dimension of length , and the small number @xmath24 depends on the strength of the spin - orbital interaction associated with the lack of inversion symmetry.@xcite on the other hand , the internal magnetic field also induces a contribution to the supercurrent , which together with the ordinary contribution can be written as ,    e*j*= ( * a*+ ) -,[current ] where @xmath25 is the vector potential defining the internal field .",
    "note that @xmath26=1 for convenience .",
    "@xmath27 in eq ( [ magnetization ] ) and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) exist only if the superconductor is non - centrosymmetric .",
    "we note here that @xcite both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the yosida function , so @xmath32 is @xmath33 near @xmath34 and increases with decreasing temperature , saturating to a constant value as @xmath35 .    the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ max1 ] ) go back to the standard singly quantized vortex when @xmath36 is set to be zero .",
    "the corresponding internal field @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a quantum of flux @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the modified bessel function of zeroth order . for nonzero @xmath36 ,",
    "an azimuthal internal field @xmath41 emerges .",
    "in addition , near the core the magnetization contains an azimuthal component proportional to @xmath42 from the phase gradient term in eq.([magnetization ] ) .",
    "this diverging behavior of @xmath43 results in a diverging @xmath44 , which was unfortunately left out in our earlier work.@xcite to see this in more detail , we first note that , due to the meissner effect , we expect that @xmath45 , the gauge invariant velocity @xmath46 hence also @xmath47 , @xmath48 all decay to zero as @xmath49 .",
    "we note that this guarantees the total magnetic flux associated with a singly quantized vortex remains to be @xmath38 , as @xmath50 over a large loop encircling the vortex . integrating eq ( [ max1 ] ) over a large area enclosing the vortex and using stokes theorem",
    ", we obtain    d l - 4 d l = ( -e ) , [ jz ]    hence automatically the condition of zero total transport current along the vortex line , since @xmath41 , @xmath43 decays to zero exponentially at large @xmath51 .",
    "however , considering eq ( [ jz ] ) for a small loop encircling the vortex , we see that for @xmath52 , @xmath53 . using eq ( [ magnetization ] ) and the fact that the magnetic flux passing through a small loop must necessarily approaches zero",
    "when the size of the loop does , we get @xmath54 hence    b_()=- , [ newbc ]    this behavior can also be obtained directly by substituting eq ( [ magnetization ] ) and ( [ current ] ) into ( [ max1 ] ) and using @xmath55 .",
    "we get    = ( -e)*j * + .[max2 ] the delta function can be taken care of by an appropriate boundary condition associated with the azimuthal field @xmath41 at the origin , as in eq ( [ newbc ] ) .",
    "( [ max2 ] ) can be solved in the manner of perturbation in @xmath36 . for @xmath56",
    ", the delta function can be ignored and the first - order correction @xmath57 satisfies the following equation , obtained by taking the curl of eq .",
    "( [ max2 ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) ,    b^(1)_()= b^(0)_z,[vortex2 ] in which the source term on the rhs arises from the extra supercurrent induced by the unperturbed internal field @xmath58 as well as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ max2 ] ) .",
    "this equation is identical to eq .",
    "( 37 ) in our previous work .",
    "@xcite there the inhomogeneous solution satisfying @xmath59 near the origin was obtained and we shall denote it as @xmath60 with the argument @xmath6 defined by @xmath61 .",
    "( thus @xmath62 represents the right hand side of eq ( 41 ) in ref .",
    "we note that this inhomogeneous solution does not satisfy the boundary condition in eq.([newbc ] ) , which can be fixed by adding an appropriate homogeneous solution to eq .",
    "( [ vortex2 ] ) satisfying eq ( [ newbc ] ) . since @xmath63 fulfills eq .",
    "( [ vortex2 ] ) in the absence of the source term and @xmath64 for small @xmath6 , we can easily write down the desired azimuthal field as ,    b^(1)_(x)= .[solution ] the azimuthal field still decays exponentially at infinity , justifying the previous assumptions . however , in contrast to our previous results,@xcite due to the @xmath65 term the azimuthal field for an isolated vortex line now has increasing magnitude towards the core .",
    "since those heavy - fermion superconductors usually have low transition temperatures and large ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath10 is practically small and usually much less than the external magnetic field , which causes the superconductor to be in the vortex lattice state in most cases .",
    "the components for transverse magnetic fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 inside the superconductor are given by the vector sums of eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) over the vortex lines located at each of the lattice vertex . for the family of li@xmath1b(pd@xmath4pt@xmath5)@xmath2 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath68 is about@xcite 20 independent of the pt composition .",
    "the transverse field depends on the lattice geometry , and @xmath69 is the only parameter with @xmath70 being the lattice constant .",
    "figs.[square ] and [ triangular ] show the contours of transverse field @xmath71 in unit of @xmath72 with @xmath69=0.5 for a square and triangular lattices , respectively . due to the delta function in eq .",
    "( [ max2 ] ) , the regions close to the core have larger transverse fields .",
    "the destructive interferences from neighboring vortex lines occur at the middle points on each side and at the center of each square and triangle , respectively .",
    "statistics on the local internal field @xmath8 give the probability distribution @xmath73 .",
    "in fig.[squarepb ] and fig .  [ tripb ] , we obtain the probability distributions @xmath73 for various values of @xmath69 in the square and triangular lattices , respectively .",
    "@xmath73 vanishes for @xmath74 , and rises up linearly with @xmath75 for small @xmath75 .",
    "it reaches a peak corresponding to the longest contour in fig .",
    "[ square ] or [ triangular ] , then decreases with increasing @xmath75 . as the value of @xmath69 decreases ,",
    "the vortex lines are getting denser and the magnetic fields associated with the peak of @xmath9 become greater .",
    "one should note , however , that there is a cutoff magnetic field associated with the vortex core for each value of @xmath69 because the minimum length scale for the above theory to be applicable here is the coherence length @xmath17 .",
    "the colored arrows are used to label these cutoffs for various @xmath69 .",
    "that is , the values of @xmath75 beyond these arrows are un - physical and the actual values are expected to be much smaller .",
    "we note that the cutoff for a single vortex is approximately given by @xmath76 times @xmath77 . for low density of vortices ,",
    "i.e. @xmath781 , the cutoff remains the same as that of a single vortex . for higher density cases ,",
    "these cutoffs are modified due to the neighboring vortices .",
    "the distributions @xmath9 can in principle be obtained from @xmath7sr measurements , operated in the following manner .",
    "positive muons with spin polarizing along the external field and hence the vortex lines are injected into the superconductor in the vortex state .",
    "in such a set - up for conventional superconductors , the muon spin polarization is not affected by the local magnetic fields , as they are parallel ( assuming that the vortex lines are straight , _ c.f . _ below ) .",
    "the decay product , the positrons , has an anisotropic distribution , being preferentially along the initial muon spin .",
    "however , for our non - centrosymmetric superconductor , the muon spins will precess around the local field @xmath8 .",
    "this gives rise to an extra decay or oscillation of the anisotropic positron distribution .",
    "this distribution is further a function of external field and temperature , with magnetic field magnitude increasing with decreasing temperature if below @xmath34 .",
    "these features may be used to distinguish from other contributions .",
    "thermal fluctuation of vortex lines may also give rise to horizontal fields , but they would increase instead of decrease with temperature .",
    "magnetic fields from nuclear moments would have a temperature dependence uncorrelated with @xmath34 .",
    "the values of @xmath69 correspond to average external magnetic fields @xmath79 according to the relation @xmath79=@xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a factor depending on the lattice geometry . for square lattice",
    "@xmath81=1 , and for triangular lattice @xmath81=@xmath82 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath83 is about @xmath84 gauss given @xmath85=360 nm in li@xmath1pt@xmath2b.@xcite if the parameter @xmath36 exceeds 10@xmath86 , then the typical fields according to fig [ squarepb ] and [ tripb ] will be of order 1 gauss , which is supposed to be measurable in the @xmath7sr measurement.@xcite in the compound li@xmath1pt@xmath2b , however , @xmath36 may unfortunately be of order 10@xmath87 only , with transverse fields that are hard to detect .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations apply to any noncentrosymmetric superconductor with o symmetry .",
    "the transverse fields may be easily measurable if @xmath32 is a few times larger and/or @xmath22 a few times shorter .",
    "the above paragraphs demonstrate the transverse magnetic field in the vortex state as a signature of broken inversion symmetry . here",
    "we elaborate on the general phase gradient @xmath88 since this vector is associated with the helical phase which is described by an order parameter @xmath89 . in a strictly two - dimensional system with open boundary ,",
    "the phase gradient can be obtained by directly setting the current density in eq.([current ] ) to be zero . since there is no meissner effect in such an ideal system ,",
    "@xmath90 is determined solely by the external field and was argued to be measurable by a josephson junction between a conventional and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor.@xcite    for our three - dimensional superconductor , @xmath90 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ max1 ] ) and ( [ current ] ) given the internal magnetic field @xmath91 .",
    "for positions not exactly at the vortex cores ,    = -^2 ( ) . in a real bulk superconductor , it can be seen that the phase gradient is small and not appreciable due to the meissner effect .",
    "for example , consider a noncentrosymmetric superconductor occupied by a single vortex .",
    "the unique phase gradient @xmath92 is along the line .",
    "given the internal fields @xmath93 and @xmath57 obtained previously , @xmath92 is vanishingly small at positions @xmath94 . only near the vortex",
