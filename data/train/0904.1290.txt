    "black holes fascinate astronomers and the general public alike due to their extreme physical conditions . how the supermassive variety came to be at the centres of most , if not all , massive galaxies has been the focus of increased research over recent years .",
    "valuable clues are thought to reside within the observed scaling laws involving the mass of the central black hole , @xmath0 , and various properties of the host galaxy ( e.g. , ferrarese & ford 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the low level of scatter within these relations suggests a direct physical connection between the black hole and the host galaxy ; although which parameters are doing the driving , or are merely along for the ride , remains unclear ( novak et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one well known scaling law involves the velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , of the host galaxy ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) . with parameter",
    "measurement errors initially of comparable size to the total root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "scatter about the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , this scaling law was heralded as a potential fundamental relation with zero intrinsic scatter ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "if correct , it would imply that the host galaxy s velocity dispersion controls the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , and is the physical property which theorists should concentrate their efforts on .",
    "the situation did however become more interesting , if not complicated , when graham ( 2007 ; 2008a , b ) and hu ( 2008 ) revealed the presence of substructure within the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "they discovered that the location of a galaxy / black hole pair in this diagram depends on whether or not the galaxy is barred ( or has a `` pseudo - bulge '' in hu s presentation ) .",
    "moreover , the offset of barred galaxies from the `` barless @xmath4-@xmath1 relation '' can be up to @xmath31 dex in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "graham ( 2008a ) suggested that the radial orbits of stars in bars may lead to an enhanced velocity dispersion measurement when one is looking down ( some component of ) the length of a bar .",
    "in addition , bars which have evolved for a sufficient amount of time are expected to increase their galaxy s central velocity dispersion , even in face on galaxies ( gadotti & de souza 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , bars with an older stellar population have been observed to possess higher velocity dispersions than younger bars ( perez et al .",
    "this will contribute to , if not explain , the discrepant behavior of barred galaxies in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram . alternatively or additionally , the supermassive black holes in barred galaxies may be relatively malnourished compared to those in barless galaxies .",
    "that is , perhaps they are still being fuelled / fed by the bar and as such are yet to reach the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ( mathur & grupe 2005a ; zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , if this were true , then the barred galaxies would also be outliers in the @xmath0-luminosity diagram , yet data to date suggests that they are not ( graham 2008a ; bentz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2001 , see also wang & lu 2001 ) have shown that black holes in agn roughly abide by the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation defined by quiescent galaxies . in this paper",
    "we explore the demographics within the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane by including a sample of 88 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "specifically , we address the question of whether or not , at a fixed black hole mass , do barred galaxies ( with agn ) have a tendency to posses greater velocity dispersions than non - barred galaxies ( with agn ) . in section  2",
    "we present the galaxy sample , and our method of image analysis to determine if a bar may be present .",
    "images for the full agn galaxy sample are available electronically . in section  3",
    "we show the location of the barred and non - barred galaxies within the @xmath4-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "galaxies with agn are revealed , for the first time , to follow the same distributions as inactive barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "that is , barred agn reside up to 1 dex in the @xmath5 direction below the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "our main conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "broad emission - line reverberation - mapping data was used by peterson et al.(2004 ) to acquire smbh virial masses for 35 agn , which were subsequently used to calibrate a number of scaling relations for estimating smbh masses in other agn ( e.g. , greene & ho 2005 ; kaspi et al .",
    "here we have used greene & ho s ( 2006 , their table  1 ) useful list of 88 local active galaxies with stellar velocity dispersion measurements and estimated black hole masses .",
    "pertaining to the broad line region s geometry and kinematics ) of these smbh masses is tied to the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of inactive galaxies ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ) , `` circular rationale '' should not be the cause of the barred and unbarred agn potentially occupying the same distribution and locus as barred and unbarred inactive galaxies in the @xmath6-@xmath1 plane .",
    "] such estimates are typically considered accurate to within a factor of 3 - 4 ( e.g. , krolik 2001 ; metzroth et al .",
    "2006 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "we then determined if a bar is present or not in these galaxies .",
    "images for the 88 agn have predominantly been taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; abazajian et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , with the remaining images obtained via the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "while a visual inspection of the images can , and often does , reveal bars in many galaxies , it also leaves some ambiguous cases . to help address these",
    "we have subtracted from the original image a number of smoothed representations . sometimes this smoothed version was an elliptical object with the same median ellipticity and position angle as the galaxy , while other times it was a gaussian smoothed version of the original image .",
    "this common technique ( e.g. , jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ; yuan et al .",
    "2001 , erwin & sparke 2002 ) created a set of residual images which can more clearly reveal non - symmetrical structures such as stellar bars .",
    "a couple of example images are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , and a complete set of images for all 88 galaxies is available electronically .",
    "in addition we used the iraf task ellipse to generate ellipticity and position angle profiles , which were found to be helpful in identifying / confirming the presence of bars .",
    "this was typically signalled by a high ellipticity over the inner regions once the bar light starts to dominate ; the ellipticity profile would then decline with increasing radius while often accompanied by a changing position angle as the outer disk comes into dominance ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we have identified which galaxies appear to have bars or not . for some galaxies we were left uncertain as to whether what appeared to be a bar was real , and we have assigned these with the status `` maybe '' .",
    "a `` no '' signals that we saw no evidence for a bar .",
    "while this system may sound obvious , it is worth clarifying that poorly resolved or edge - on systems in which a bar might exist but for which we saw no evidence are designated as `` no '' rather than `` maybe '' . given our suspicion that the outlying galaxies in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram are barred , a stronger test of our hypothesis would therefore involve such an economical assignment of bars .",
    "we have however denoted five galaxies ( ngc  3227 , 3516 , 3783 , 4151 , and 7469 ) to be barred given their designation as such by others , according to ned , although this was not clear from the sdss images . from the 88 agn we were able to positively ( tentatively ) identify 26 ( 16 ) barred galaxies , giving a _ total _ fraction of 42/88 which is roughly half of the sample .",
    "we do however note that for twenty small and faint galaxies with @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , it was hard to detect the presence of a bar and all but one have been tabulated as having no ( detectable ) bar .",

    ". the median solution ( plus / minus 34% ) from the distribution of 10000 simulations has a slope and intercept of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , and is therefore consistent with our two other symmetrical regression analyses for this data .      figures  [ fig3]b and [ fig3]c include both the inactive and active galaxies .",
    "a few galaxies stand out and may be worthy of identification . for example , the barred galaxy in the lower - left of figure  [ fig3]c ( with @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath8 ) is galaxy number 62 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , a face - on sc galaxy that may be barred .",
    "the four most discrepant non - barred agn , found to the right of the shaded region and with @xmath16 are galaxies 6 , 8 , 9 and 57 from table  [ tab1 ] . galaxy number 6 is poorly resolved , making its morphology difficult to dissect .",
    "galaxy number 8 is an edge - on disk galaxy making it difficult to detect a bar if one exists .",
    "the inactive galaxy with a smbh mass of @xmath17 , which appears ten times greater than the value expected from the relation , is ngc  5252 .",
    "we caution that figures  [ fig3]b and [ fig3]c are probably not as strong evidence against a separation of barred and unbarred galaxies as a first inspection would suggest .",
    "this is because many of the galaxies with velocity dispersions less than 80 - 90 km s@xmath8 are too faint and/or not well enough resolved for us to identify if a bar is present .",
    "however , most galaxies which deviate from the `` barless '' @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , in the sense that they have overly - large velocity dispersions , do tend to be barred galaxies .",
    "if we have failed to identify bars in the sample with @xmath18 km s@xmath8 , then correcting this would only increase the population of outlying galaxies that are barred . among the 68 agn with @xmath18 km s@xmath8 ,",
    "38 are barred or show some indication of possibly being barred .",
    "this equates to 56% of a sample which includes both elliptical and disk galaxies .",
    "only 4 of the 30 non - barred agn galaxies with @xmath18 km s@xmath8 display a clear departure to the right of the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , while roughly half of the 38 barred agn galaxies are deviant in this manner .",
    "it turns out that this behaviour could have been predicted prior to the confirmation provided here .",
    "this is because it was known that a ) large scale stellar bars are much more common in narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies than broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 ; deo et al .",
    "2006 ) and that b ) narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies are observed to reside rightward of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation traced by broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( mathur et al .",
    "2001 ; wandel 2002 ; grupe & mathur 2004 ; mathur & grupe 2005b ) . for the 82 non - barred galaxies",
    " taken from the inactive sample of 50 galaxies plus the sample of 88 active galaxies  the ( symmetrical ) bisector bces regression analysis gives the relation @xmath19,\\ ] ] with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.42 dex in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the slope of this relation is shallower than the ( symmetrical ) @xmath0-@xmath1 relations presented by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) , the latter reporting a slope of @xmath20 . obviously from figure  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the exclusion of barred galaxies results in the shallower slope reported here .",
    "a slope of 4.24 is obtained when we include all the galaxies .    using the ( non - symmetrical ) ordinary least squares regression within the bces routine which minimises the scatter in the @xmath5 direction , and is therefore preferred for predicting smbh masses , one obtains the expression @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{eq_non}\\ ] ] this regression does however yield a comparable r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.41 dex in the @xmath5 direction . using the two other routines from section  [ inactive",
    "] produces a consistent result . while this `` barless '' relation is also consistent with the previous ( non - symmetrical ) @xmath0-@xmath1 relations presented by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the latter reporting a slope of @xmath22 , equation  [ eq_non ] has been derived using 82 non - barred galaxies rather than 31 barred and barless galaxies and is not applicable to barred galaxies . while inclusion of the barred galaxies results in the relation @xmath23 $ ] , with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.47 dex , this overlooks the fact that the scatter is not uniformly distributed about this relation . a more reliable estimate of the smbh masses in barred galaxies would come from a subtraction of 0.3 dex from the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation s prediction , i.e. dividing by two , and assigning an unceratinty of @xmath30.4 dex .",
    "the presence of a bar can , but does not necessarily , result in a galaxy residing significantly off the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation . given that , at a fixed velocity dispersion , the range in smbh mass spans a factor of @xmath350 when considering both non - barred and barred galaxies , it is obviously neither desirable nor optimal to use a single @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for all galaxy types .",
    "the predictive power of such a relation would be too weak for practical purposes .    while the `` barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation '' is useful for non - barred galaxies , in order to accommodate the barred galaxies it would be advantageous if one could identify a third parameter which could account for their offset nature . while barred galaxies do have smaller bulges than large elliptical galaxies",
    ", the use of effetcive half - light bulge radii as a third parameter may only serve to complicate matters .",
    "this is because non - barred galaxies with equally small bulge sizes do not deviate from the locus of points defining the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation and thus bulge size is not the reason why the barred galaxies appear offset .",
    "obviously though , plotting the @xmath4-@xmath1 residuals against bulge size will yield a trend , and this has led some to ( perhaps prematurely ) conclude that a smbh `` fundamental plane '' involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 exists ( see feoli & mele 2007 ; aller & richstone 2007 ; hopkins et al .  2007 ) .",
    "nonetheless , if the virial expression @xmath26 roughly produces bulge masses , and @xmath0 is related to @xmath27 , then one should expect the addition of @xmath25 , as initially done by marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) , to make sense .",
    "however for pure elliptical galaxies the addition of @xmath25 appears to offer no benefit ( graham 2008a ) and thus further undermines the value of @xmath25 as a potential third parameter .",
    "we feel that more galaxy structural data may be needed to resolve this issue .",
    "graham ( 2008a ) speculated that the offset nature of the barred galaxies may be related to an increased exposure to the radial orbits of stars in bars .",
    "if this is the case , then one would expect that the bars in more inclined ( i.e. , edge - on ) galaxies will , in general , have increased velocity dispersions if the bars are orientated toward us .",
    "of course an edge - on galaxy may still have a bar which is aligned along the plane of the sky , yielding no increase to the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "nonetheless , to probe this idea we can use the inclination of the disks , traced by the ellipticity of their outer isophotes .",
    "the inclinations , @xmath28 , of the disk galaxies are of course related to their observed ellipticities via @xmath29 , which were themselves obtained from the iraf routine ellipse and are listed in table  1 . the data in figure  [ fig4 ] , which shows the vertical residuals about the `` barless @xmath0-@xmath1 '' for the barred galaxies , plotted against the apparent disk ellipticity ( @xmath30 ) , are not particularly supportive of this scenario as they do not reveal a distribution of residuals which broadens at larger elliptcities .",
    "the near uniform distribution of points in figure  [ fig4 ] suggests that something other than disk inclination may be at play .",
    "as noted by gadotti & kauffmann ( 2009 ) , it could be the age of the bar such that older bars have had time to increase the central velocity dispersion and thereby drive galaxies off the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation . indeed , perez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have reported that older bars have greater velocity dispersions than younger bars .",
    "they also note that older bars have positive metallicity gradients .",
    "unfortunately , such diagnosis requires spatially resolved spectral information which is not trivial to acquire , and therefore difficult to implement as a practical third parameter to reduce the scatter in the @xmath4-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "a number of immediate observations can be made from the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "( 1 ) while agn have a reputation for displaying a greater level of scatter in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram than inactive galaxies , this is primarily because the agn sample contains many barred galaxies .",
    "that is , the greater uncertainty from ( reverberation mapping and emission line)-derived black hole masses , compared to direct measurements , is not the main cause of the increased scatter in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "( 2 ) the barred galaxies , in the current sample of 138 galaxies , tend not to have smbh masses greater than @xmath31 .",
    "( this is in part a reflection on the maximum masses of bulges in disk galaxies . ) ( 3 ) to the left of the shaded region in figure  [ fig3]b , galaxies tend not to be barred , while to the right of the shaded region most of the galaxies are barred .",
    "this structure within the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane inhibits the accuracy to which black hole masses can be predicted in other ( barred ) galaxies for which only the velocity dispersion is known . while for elliptical and barless disk galaxies one can still obtain an accurate estimate using the `` barless @xmath4-@xmath1 relation '' ( equation  2 ) , the situation is less favourable for the barred galaxies",
    ". it may be that dynamically old bars have increased the central velocity dispersion in these galaxies .",
    "the obvious consequence of this work is that the galaxy velocity dispersion is not the sole driving force which determines the masses of black holes at the centres of galaxies .",
    "it is also apparent that dividing one s sample into elliptical and disk galaxies is not an appropriate approach to take as this would come at the expense of accurate smbh masses for non - barred disc galaxies .",
    "barred galaxies do not appear as outliers in current relations involving black hole mass and spheroid luminosity ( graham 2008a , his figure  3 ; bentz et al .",
    "2009 ) . increasing the sample sizes used in these diagrams , which has currently been limited to only 20 to 30 objects , is recommended .",
    "acquiring deeper , higher - resolution , near - infrared images than 2mass would be a valuable step forward toward better understanding the driving forces that dictate the masses of supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies .",
    "it should also be insightful to determine , in subsequent work , the scaling factor ( e.g. , onken et al .  2004 ) which brings reverberation - based smbh masses for nonbarred agn into better agreement with the barless @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for quiescent galaxies .",
    "the prevalence of barred agn in such past analyses may have skewed these measurements and hindered constraints for the different broad - line region models .",
    "ongoing and future observing reverberation mapping campaigns may therefore like to consider focussing on non - barred agn for which the velocity dispersion is , or can be readily , acquired .",
