    "the transfer of electrons between metallic leads separated by vacuum or an insulating gap is classically forbidden .",
    "however , it becomes possible if the size of the gap is reduced to the scale of a few angstroms due to the tunneling effect .",
    "this entirely quantum mechanical effect , which allows the electrons to cross the forbidden region , was already discussed in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite and first observed in the 1960s on planar superconducting  oxide  normal conducting junctions @xcite .    in general , the electron transport in such tunnel junctions",
    "can be divided into two distinct classes : elastic tunneling in which an applied bias drives electrons from the many states of one electrode to cross the junction without interaction with the local environment and inelastic tunneling , where the electrons interact with the junction environment and change their energy , phase , or angular momentum .",
    "these inelastic processes leave characteristic fingerprints in bias dependent conductance measurements .",
    "in particular , when discrete states are excited during tunneling and the tunneling electron looses partly its kinetic energy , a bias threshold voltage can be observed below which the inelastic process can not occur ( figure  [ fig : iets ] ) . in this sense",
    "inelastic tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) is complementary to far - field methods such as high resolution electron energy - loss ( hreels ) , infrared reflection adsorption ( irras ) , raman spectroscopy , or inelastic neutron spectroscopy @xcite and has been performed in planar tunnel junctions to detect vibrational excitation modes of molecules embedded in the junction for almost 50 years @xcite .",
    "remarkably , besides molecular vibrations , excitations due to the interaction of electrons with localized magnetic impurities have already been studied in these pioneering days leading to the discovery of anomalies in the density of states very close to the fermi energy , which was shown to be due to the formation of a kondo state and inelastic spin - flip excitations @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath0 , respectively : in addition to the elastic tunneling current , an inelastic channel may open at a bias @xmath1 with @xmath2 as the energy difference between the ground and an excited internal state . under this circumstances",

    "this is smeared out at non - zero temperature ( dashed line ) leading to peaks with a width of @xmath7 in the @xmath4 curve .",
    "figure adapted from reference @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    while planar tunnel junctions have the disadvantage of averaging over an ill - defined contact area , the development of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) by binning , rohrer , gerber , and weibl in the early 1980s @xcite opened a entirely new world for tunneling experiments .",
    "very soon it became clear that the stm , with its capability to atomically resolve metallic and semiconducting surfaces , would become a powerful tool for the analysis of surfaces and nanoscale structures down to the single molecule or atom level .",
    "its discovery was awarded with the nobel prize in a surprisingly short time of only 4 years after its first successful demonstration .    in the early days of stm , collective vibrational excitations at the surface of graphite were detected @xcite , however , it was clear that the true capability of the stm would lie in combining its spectroscopic possibilities with its inherent atomic resolution",
    ". nevertheless , it took about 15 years of technology development before the mechanical stability and electronic sensibility of the stm at cryogenic temperatures and in ultrahigh vacuum was high enough to make this dream reality .",
    "the year 1998 brought two important experimental breakthroughs : the group around wilson ho at the cornell university showed for the first time that iets was possible on the single molecular level using the spatial resolution of the stm @xcite . in their experiment",
    "they detected the vibrational excitations of an isolated acetylene ( c@xmath8h@xmath8 ) molecule adsorbed on a cu(100 ) surface .",
    "the detection of mechanical excitation in molecular systems , has since been applied to many quite different molecular systems ranging from diatomics like carbon monoxide @xcite , metal hydride molecules @xcite , and molecular hydrogen @xcite to complex molecules like porphyrins @xcite and c@xmath9 bucky balls @xcite .",
    "however , importantly for the work discussed in this manuscript , inelastic excitations can also be observed on individual spin systems as discovered by andreas heinrich and co - workers at ibm almaden first on mn atoms adsorbed on patches of al@xmath8o@xmath10 on a nial surface @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss in the following , spin excitation spectroscopy gives unparalleled access to the quantum nature of individual and coupled spin systems enabling the determination and manipulation of their spin states , their magnetic anisotropy , and their coupling with the environment ; properties which are actually mutually interdependent .",
    "the second breakthrough was the detection of the spectroscopic signature of the correlated many - particle kondo state of individual magnetic atoms adsorbed on non - magnetic metal substrates .",
    "this discovery was made almost simultaneously by the group around wolf - dieter schneider at the university lausanne @xcite and the group around michael crommie at the university of boston @xcite .",
    "these two hallmarking observations are the foundation on which the work presented here is based . both rely on the interaction of individual spins , i.e.  atoms or molecules which have a magnetic moment , with the local environment as is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : spin ] .",

    "this situation changes . when the atom is physisorbed , the out - of - plane direction forms a distinct axis , different from all other directions .",

    "the influence of the magnetic anisotropy on the tunneling spectra will be briefly discussed in section [ sec : anisotropy ] .",
    "here , we will additionally see how the strength of the direct exchange coupling between the localized magnetic moment and the itinerant electron bath of the substrate modifies the magnetic anisotropy via virtual coherences between the eigenstates @xcite .    while the magnetic anisotropy removes the degeneracies of high spin systems , for half - integer spins kramers theorem prevails the full lifting of all degeneracies @xcite . in these systems",

    "magnetic anisotropy defines the preferred directions in which the magnetic moment of a spin of strength @xmath24 likes to be aligned and is crucial for the lifetime in which the direction of magnetization is maintained @xcite .",
    "while a spin carrying atom in gas phase can not have any magnetic anisotropy due to its spherical symmetry , the situation changes when the spin is embedded into a crystal structure . the crystal field and the spin - orbit coupling lead to a lifting of the degeneracies .",

    "spin operators , which are usually expressed in stevens operators @xmath26 to easily connect to point group symmetries @xcite : @xmath27 with @xmath28 as the parameters . as we will see , it is often a good approximation to assume the crystal field spin hamiltonian to be only quadratic in the spin operators with a symmetric coupling matrix  * d * : @xmath29 where the scalar parameter @xmath30 determines the axial and @xmath31 the transverse anisotropy , and @xmath32 is the total spin operator .    for adatoms on surfaces , a low coordination number and changes in hybridization can lead to a dramatic enhancement of magnetic anisotropy @xcite which have been shown to reach values of up to @xmath33  mev for co adatoms on mgo @xcite",
    ". additionally , different surface adsorption sites or the bonding to hydrogen alter the magnetic anisotropy or even the total spin of the adatoms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the exchange interaction with the substrate can affect the observed magnetic anisotropy as it has been found for 3d metal adatoms on cu@xmath8n islands on cu(100 ) @xcite or metal - hydrates on @xmath34-bn on rh(111 ) @xcite .",
    "for single molecule magnets containing @xmath35 or @xmath36 spin centers it is well known that chemical changes to the ligands surrounding the spin can affect the magnetic anisotropy @xcite . however , the most important factor for creating and maintaining magnetic anisotropy in single molecule magnets remains a low coordination number and a high axial symmetry @xcite . under such conditions the symmetry - protected magnetic ground state of single ho - atoms adsorbed on a double - layer of mgo on ag(100 ) can lead to relaxation times of 1  h at a temperature of 2.5  k as recently observed in magnetic circular dichroism measurements @xcite .    in this section",

    "surprisingly , these steps are well described using only a second order perturbation spin - flip model and do not show any third order logarithmic contributions .",
    "this means that the probability of the third order scattering channels must be closed due to the ground - state correlation between the localized spin and the substrate electrons .    under an applied magnetic field , the peak splits and the spin - flip excitation step positions shift in energy .",
    "interestingly , the single - particle magnetic anisotropy hamiltonian of equation [ eq : atom - hamilonian ] not only describes the energy shift of the inelastic conductance steps accurately , but also the positions of the split kondo peak .",
    "the peak width at zero - field corresponds to a kondo temperature of @xmath305  k and the broadening of the peak at elevated temperatures follows equation [ equ : kondo - fl ] as expected from fermi liquid theory @xcite and as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : co - cun - strong]b .",
    "note , that at even higher temperatures , where @xmath191 , we reach again the weak - coupling limit and the spectrum is better described with the perturbative model and temperature broadened logarithmic divergences as shown in figure [ fig : co - cun ] . due to the limitations of equation [ equ : kondo - fl ] , which is only valid at @xmath306 ,",
    "fitting temperature dependent experimental data in the weak coupling limit with lorenzian or frota functions can lead to unphysically high @xmath133 values @xcite . in such cases , @xmath186 is presumably much smaller than the experimentally accessed temperatures .      as we have seen in the last section , when external magnetic fields which exceed the kondo correlation energy , i.e. @xmath307 , are applied to a strongly coupled kondo system the zero - bias resonance splits into two distinct parts ( figure [ fig : co - cun - strong]a ) @xcite .",
    "however , while this has been observed also for other systems @xcite , the spin - resolved properties of such a split kondo state and , in particular , the amount of spin polarization of the two resulting peaks remains elusive @xcite . while there is one early spin - resolved measurement of a split kondo state @xcite , the asymmetry of the peaks was not studied systematically and a comprehensive picture was only found recently using individual co adatoms on cu@xmath8n as a test system @xcite .    in this experiment",
    "a spin - polarized tip was prepared by picking up mn atoms from the cu@xmath8n surface with a conventional stm tip @xcite .",
    "since the measured asymmetry in the spectrum is the product of sample and tip spin polarization , @xmath308 , it is crucial to characterize the degree of spin polarization of the tip .",
    "this was done by spin - resolved measurements of individual mn atoms on the same surface .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : ani - fe - mn ] and displayed in figure [ fig : spec - fe - mn]c and [ fig : spec - fe - mn]e , mn atoms on cu@xmath8n show one spin - flip excitation at about 1 mv . when measured with a spin - polarized tip , the heights of the inelastic steps at positive and negative voltage ( @xmath309 and @xmath310 ) differ @xcite",
    ". the asymmetry of the step heights @xmath311 can now be measured as a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "because of the small magnetocrystalline anisotropy of mn the nominal spin polarization of the step is @xmath312 and therefore the experimental @xmath313 is a quantitative measure of the tip spin polarization @xmath314 .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of the tip s spin polarization was found to be consistent with a paramagnetic behavior of the mn atoms on the sample and the metallic tip .",
    "hence the magnetic field - dependent spin polarization of the tip can be well described by the brillouin function : @xmath315 with @xmath316 , @xmath237 , @xmath13 , and a maximal polarization @xmath317 .    utilizing this spin - polarized tip at magnetic fields leads to spectra on the co atoms as displayed for @xmath318  t in figure [ fig : co - sp1 ] .",
    "the two spectra differ by the adsorption site of the co atom and therefore correspond to the situation where the magnetic field is either applied along ( a ) or perpendicular ( b ) to the main anisotropy axis ( see also figure [ fig : co - cun - strong]a ) .",
    "these spectra can be excellently fitted by using the sum of two double - step functions with step - energies symmetrically around zero - bias and asymmetric step - heights , and two frota peak - functions ( equation [ equ : frota ] ) at the energies of the energetically low - lying step , with identical half - width but different intensities .",

    "we now continue to evaluate spectra measured at different fields by subtracting the inelastic , step - like contributions , and analyzing the kondo peaks using frota functions as shown in figure [ fig : co - sp2]a and [ fig : co - sp2]b .    , * ( d ) * the peak height @xmath322 , * ( e ) * the area @xmath323 , and * ( f ) * the experimental peak asymmetry @xmath324 plotted against the splitting energy @xmath325 .",

    "interestingly , the behavior of the kondo peak seems to be related to the splitting energy as the data applied along the vacancy row and along the n - row fall on top of each other when plotted versus the peak energy @xmath325 .",

    "is extracted to @xmath328  k , equal to the previously stated @xmath305  k ( figure [ fig : co - cun - strong ] ) @xcite , which corresponds to a correlation energy of @xmath329  mev .",
    "when the splitting exceeds this energy , we observe that the spectral weight of the correlated state , i.e.  the area @xmath330 underneath the kondo peak , settles at about twice the zero field value and remains afterward constant irrespective of magnetic field strength up to @xmath299  t or , equivalently , @xmath331 ( figure  [ fig : co - sp2]e ) .",
    "presumably , this stems from the lifting of the spin degeneracy of the kondo singlet state at significant field .",
    "note , that the the transport measurement , as it is performed here , might introduce additional spectral weight created by the hot electrons at finite bias , similar as observed with spin - polarized currents on fe atoms on cu@xmath8n @xcite and rationalized with a 3rd order scattering transport model including rate - equations @xcite . here , however , we have not observed any strong current dependencies .    in the regime ,",

    "the factor 2 hints to an equal contribution of correlations induced by the bulk electrons and by the biased electrons in the transport experiment when @xmath325 exceeds the kondo energy scale .    finally , figure [ fig : co - sp2]f shows that the effective polarization of the kondo peak @xmath324 for the two different field directions stays approximately constant and is close to @xmath335 , with a small systematic offset between the two field directions . in order to derive the spin polarization of the split kondo peak @xmath336",

    "the states of the strongly coupled spin are antiferromagetically correlated with the substrate electrons ( see section [ sec : kondo ] ) , while the weakly coupled spin is ferromagnetically correlated with the substrate bath via the heisenberg interaction ( figure [ fig : s1s12peak]e and f ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a ferromagnetic kondo effect , which has been recently proposed to emerge for a triple spin system @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this requires a heisenberg exchange interaction between both spins .",
    "if the interaction is ising - like , i.e.  couples only one direction of the magnetic moments , merely classical correlations occur , which are not sufficient to create the entanglement required to observe the kondo effect for the spin-1 system ( see dashed lines in figure [ fig : s1s12peak]a and b ) .",
    "however , the results presented here are obtained in the weak coupling limit . while it is known that a single spin will become asymptotically free for @xmath272 when ferromagnetically coupled to an electron bath @xcite , it is not clear what happens in the coupled structures discussed here , where one spin is ferromagnetically and the other antiferromagetically coupled to the substrate .",
    "note , that the two spins can be coupled also vertically by having one spin center adsorbed to the tip apex and the second one onto the substrate surface . in this situation , the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling has been found to be proportional to the tunneling coupling which depends exponentially on the distance between the two spins on tip and sample @xcite . building a similar structure",
    "as discussed in this section with a @xmath46 spin adsorbed on the sample and a strongly correlated half - integer spin on the tip lead to the observation of bias direction dependent step asymmetries at the energetically outer steps ( blue dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1-s12]d ) .",
    "these asymmetries enable to directly determine the correlation strength between the half - integer spin and the supporting electron bath @xcite .",
    "dimer spin systems have been studied experimentally for different transition metal atoms on metallic and insulating surfaces . for co atoms on au(111 ) , which show a pronounced kondo effect with a @xmath441  k , the disappearance of the kondo effect due to the formation of a non - magnetic singlet state was observed only when the two adatoms were strongly coupled by placing them on neighboring adsorption sites @xcite . in a similar experiment using cu(100 ) , the exchange interaction could be varied concomitantly with a change of the spectroscopic signature @xcite .",
    "more recently , the coupling between two kondo systems was established by attaching one co atom to the apex of a au tip and having the second co atom adsorbed on a au(111 ) surface @xcite or between metal  molecule complexes in a non - consummate molecular lattice on au(111 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spin - spin interactions have been studied between fe - fe @xcite , co - co @xcite , and co - fe @xcite adatoms adsorbed on cu@xmath8n .",
    "we will revisit the latter co - fe dimer system and compare it to simulations done in the third order scattering model presented in reference @xcite . in the experiment",
    "the two spins are separated by @xmath442  nm and only weakly coupled via the cu@xmath8n surface ( see inset of figure [ fig : co - fe]a ) , but the measurements of the differential conductance on both atoms reveal a change in the spectra compared to the individual atoms as discussed in section [ sec : ani - fe - mn ] and [ sec : kondo ] and shown in figure [ fig : co - fe]a and b.    n. * ( a+b ) * experimental data from reference @xcite obtained with the tip placed on top of the fe ( a ) and co ( b ) atom of the bipartite system at different fields applied along the main anisotropy axis of the fe measured at @xmath152  mk ( red circles ) . the simulations ( black lines )",
    "are performed using the following parameters for the fe atom : @xmath443  mev , @xmath142  mev , @xmath143 , @xmath444 , and @xmath155 ; for the co atom : @xmath240  mev , @xmath241  mev , @xmath445 , @xmath446 , and @xmath447 .",
    "note , that the main anisotropy axis for the fe is along the n - rows , while for the co it is along the vacancy rows .",

    "the labels correspond to the @xmath450 values.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    simulating the data by using parameters almost identical to those employed for uncoupled single co and fe atoms , and an additional isotropic heisenberg interaction of @xmath448  mev , renders the spectra obtained for the fe atom almost perfectly , but only the main features and not all details are reproduced for the spectra measured on the co atom .",
    "this stems from the fact , that our model only accounts for third order scattering contributions , neglecting higher order effects and reaches its limits in systems in the strong - coupling kondo regime ( see section [ sec : kondo - limit ] ) .    at zero field",
    "we observe on the fe atom a reduction of the intensity of the low - energy conductance steps compared to the uncoupled atom ( figure [ fig : spec - fe - mn]a ) .",
    "furthermore , these steps diminish when a field along the main anisotropy axis of the fe atom ( @xmath14-axis ) is applied , much more quickly than for the uncoupled fe atom .",
    "nevertheless , the overall spectral form is only weakly influenced by the coupling to the co atom .",
    "the coupling is also not strong enough to produce a zero - energy feature at the high spin in this dimer , i.e.  the fe atom , as we would expect from the discussion of the coupled @xmath378 and @xmath379 system ( section [ sec : s1s12 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the density matrices of the two degenerate groundstates of the combined system ( figure [ fig : co - fe]c and d ) .",
    "the two groundstates contain only contributions with weights at high @xmath451 values , inhibiting any scattering between them .",
    "note that a description via quantum numbers of the total system is not appropriate here due to the small coupling strength .",
    "only when the heisenberg coupling is comparable to the anisotropy energies , i.e.  at @xmath452  mev , these quantum numbers become a good description of the total system and the emergence of a zero - energy peak at the fe atom is expected , similar to the dimer with @xmath378 and @xmath379 .",
    "compared to the spectrum measured on the fe atom , the zero - field spectrum on the co atom is strongly affected by the creation of this bipartite system .",
    "similar as for the @xmath378 and @xmath379 dimer , we observe in the experimental data , as well as in the simulation , conductance steps and peaks at an energy corresponding to the first excitation energy of the fe atom .",
    "additionally , the remainder of the zero - bias kondo peak is clearly visible , but similar as in the example of the last section , the coupling to the fe atom has already strongly reduced its intensity . at an applied field along the easy axes of both atoms , the energetic positions of the two peaks at low bias move towards zero and at a critical field of @xmath453  t , a novel kondo peak at zero bias emerges . at even higher fields",
    "the spectra resemble those of an uncoupled co atom , as shown in figure [ fig : co - cun ] , where the presence of the fe atom has reduced the magnetic field to @xmath454 .",
    "overall , it is surprising how well the perturbative model can reproduce the experimental data for this bipartite systems .",
    "note , that not only does it enable us to determine the coupling strength and sign between interacting spins , but it also allows us to detect additional non - collinear couplings such as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , as it has been recently shown @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case where two co atoms with @xmath19 are coupled via heisenberg interactions on the cu@xmath8n substrate @xcite .",
    "this situation is in particular interesting , because at low enough temperature both spin sites form independently a correlated kondo state with the substrate electrons as discussed in section [ sec : kondo ] .",
    "we have seen that the characteristic correlation energy of the kondo state is @xmath455  mev ( see section [ sec : kondo - split ] ) .",
    "this energy scale is of the same order as the heisenberg exchange coupling strength in the previously discussed fe - co dimers .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : co - co]a , the competition between these two effects in combination with an external magnetic field embodies rich physics ranging from a correlated singlet or triplet state to complex kondo states and has been of considerable theoretical interest since decades @xcite .",

    "when the coupling @xmath380 is negligible compared to @xmath333 and the magnetic field is zero , then the two spins are independently kondo screened . an applied magnetic field which is strong enough",
    "will destroy the correlations between the localized spin and the bulk electrons as discussed in detail in section [ sec : kondo ] leading to a situation where each spin acts like a free local magnetic moment .",
    "the situation changes when @xmath380 is at similar order as @xmath333 . for either sign of @xmath380 ,",
    "the four lowest ground states of the combined spins govern now the behavior of the dimer .",
    "the zero - field energy difference between the lowest and the highest state of the quartet is thereby @xmath465 ( see figure [ fig : co - co]b and [ fig : co - co]c ) . in the limit of @xmath457",
    "being much smaller than the magnetic anisotropy @xmath466 of the individual spins , the difference between the ground state and the first excited state is either @xmath467 or @xmath468 for anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling , respectively .",
    "this different behavior enables even at zero - field to distinguish clearly from differential conductance measurements between afm and fm coupled dimers @xcite .    in the case of fm coupling",
    ", the ground state can be written in the @xmath12 base of the two spin sites as @xmath469 , i.e.  as the symmetric high - spin , low - magnetic moment triplet state .",
    "any applied external magnetic field will polarize both spins moving the system closer to the free local magnetic moment regime as can be seen in figure  [ fig : co - co]b .",
    "more interesting is the case where both spins are afm coupled .",
    "the ground state in the @xmath12 base of the two spin sites is the antisymmetric low - spin singlet state @xmath470 .",
    "this singlet state will compete with the many electron kondo singlet between the _ individual _ spins and the substrate electrons .",
    "if the coupling @xmath380 is strong enough , the dimer - singlet becomes the energetically more favorable ground state and correlations with the substrate electrons concomitant with the kondo peak disappear @xcite .",
    "however , as the state diagram in figure [ fig : co - co]c suggests , a magnetic field orthogonal to the main anisotropy axis will decrease the energy difference between the ground state singlet and the lowest triplet state until the crossing field @xmath471 is reached , at which the two states become degenerate . at this point",
    "the two degenerated states @xmath472 and @xmath473 form the basis for the emergence of a new kondo state in which the substrate electrons are correlated with the _ combined _ state of the dimer @xcite .",
    "chains of exchange coupled spins have been of interest for studying fundamental questions since the early days of quantum mechanics , dating back to the exact solution found by h.  bethe @xcite for the infinite spin-@xmath55 chain .",
    "higher dimensional @xmath474 coupled spin lattices have led to the development of spin wave models @xcite , which are the basis of descriptions of collective bosonic excitations , so called magnons , which have been observed in stm measurements , for example , on thin co films on cu(111 ) @xcite .    in one - dimensional spin - chains",
    "there is a peculiar difference between half - integer and integer spins : while infinite half - integer spin chains become gap - less @xcite , the energy difference between ground and first excited state in integer spins will always be finite , leading to the so called haldane gap @xcite . interestingly ,",
    "as long as the magnetic anisotropy is small compared to the next - neighbor heisenberg coupling strength , edge - states are expected to appear in finite integer spin - chains of odd lengths @xcite .",
    "these half - spin degeneracies should reveal themselves by symmetric zero - energy kondo peaks at the end of the chain together with a reduced lifetime .",
    "very recently , the lifetime reduction at the ends of an antiferromagetically coupled 3-spin fe chain on cu@xmath8n has been observed @xcite . nevertheless , due to the relatively high magnetic anisotropy and low next - neighbor coupling strength , the formation of a zero - bias peak at the end was impeded .    here , we want to explore and model spin - chains starting with the @xmath46 and @xmath16 dimer of section [ sec : coupled_seystems ] where we assume an identical coupling @xmath118 of the individual spins with the substrate and , for simplicity , a negligible magnetic anisotropy of the @xmath46 spin .",
    "an antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction results then in a zero - bias peak mainly at the @xmath46 site similar to the spectra shown in figure [ fig : s1-s12 ] . to stay in the interesting @xmath475 regime ,",

    "furthermore , we observe many step - like inelastic excitations at increasing energy , which reveal rich features .",
    "the probabilities for second and third order scattering processes , i.e.  the step heights and the additional peak - like structures , oscillate along the chain remarkably differently for the various excitation energies .",
    "this multitude of possible transitions stems from the enormous number of low lying excitations in this many - spin system .",
    "figure [ fig : chain]b shows the 56 lowest eigenstates with energies @xmath486  mev .",
    "the groundstate is a doublet with total spin @xmath475 and is separated by about @xmath487  mev from the first excited states , a quadruplet with @xmath480 .",
    "however , there are many eigenstates in the chain that result in a total spin of @xmath55 or @xmath488 , but with different contributions and weights of the individual spins .",
    "this is reflected in the oscillatory behavior of the transition probabilities and stems from the boundaries at the ends of the chain and the chain asymmetry , leading to a complex standing wave pattern for the coupling to the magnons of the chain @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the zero - energy peak decays approximately exponentially along the chains as follows : @xmath489 here , @xmath482 is the peak amplitude measured at the @xmath485-th spin of a chain with length @xmath483 , and @xmath490 is the decay length , which approaches @xmath491 for long chains .",
    "odd - even fluctuations of the peak amplitude are due to some ferromagnetic exchange interactions of the spins in the chain with the substrate electron bath , similar to what we observed for the dimer ( figure [ fig : s1s12peak ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the maximal zero - energy peak amplitude at the last spin of the chains diminishes for longer chains only slowly with @xmath492 , and thus approaches a final value of @xmath493 for long spin chains , with @xmath494 as the peak amplitude of a single @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig : chain]c ) .",
    "this result is very remarkable .",
    "it means that the presence of a spin-@xmath55 at the beginning of an ideal , arbitrarily long , @xmath46 chain determines the appearance of the zero - bias peak at the opposite end of the chain .",
    "note that removing the spin-@xmath55 in chains with _ odd _",
    "length results in an _ even _ spin-1 chain with a non - magnetic groundstate of @xmath495 and a finite haldane gap to the excited states @xcite .",
    "obviously , such a spin system can not have any zero - bias peak .    removing the spin-@xmath55 from chains with _ even _ length ,",
    "makes the chain an _ odd _ chain that has a three - fold degenerate groundstate of @xmath496 and topologically protected edge states which are expected to show a weak zero - energy peak at both ends of the chain @xcite . here too , the addition of a single spin-@xmath55 completely changes the properties .",
    "clearly , the ideal case as discussed above can not be realized in real experiments .",
    "the adsorption of the spin-@xmath382 on a surface will break the symmetry inducing some magnetic anisotropy as we have discussed in section [ sec : coh ] . assuming an anisotropy of the same strength as the heisenberg interaction between neighboring sites leads to much more quickly decaying peak - intensities ( figure [ fig : chain_entangle]a and b ) .     for different chain lengths",

    "thus is effectively reducing any scattering between the groundstates . for easy - plane anisotropy ( @xmath226 ) , which favors @xmath420 values at each site , the peak - intensities do not drop as quickly , but the strongest peak occurs now no longer at the end of the chain , but is rather smeared out at approximately the center of the chain .",
    "interestingly , for all three cases discussed , the peak - intensities of the last spin of chains with different lengths @xmath483 follow quite simple algebraic relations ( see figure [ fig : chain_entangle]c ) : @xmath505 except for @xmath506 , all peak intensities decay either with an exponential law or an inverse power law .",
    "note , that also for @xmath507 decay laws exist , which predict that the peak at the end of the chain disappears for @xmath508 .",
    "we can understand this behavior if we look at the quantum mechanical entanglement inside the chain .",
    "for vanishing magnetic anisotropy the system is maximally entangled , while any anisotropy reduces the chain entanglement . to measure the entanglement inside the chain",
    "we calculate the negativity @xmath500 of different sites in the chain with respect to the total chain using equation [ eq : negativity ] .",
    "figure [ fig : chain_entangle]d shows the results for a small chain of length @xmath509 and different relative magnetic anisotropies @xmath502 . for moderately small easy - plane anisotropy or for easy - axis anisotropy , the entanglement of the total chain is strongest with the last spin , but decays with the strength of the magnetic anisotropy . for larger easy - plane anisotropy",
    "@xmath510 the entanglement for spins closer to the beginning of the chain grows , and finally becomes larger than the entanglement with the chain end .",
    "thus , quantum - mechanically , the chain separates in a moderately entangled short chain that consists of the spin-@xmath55 and a weakly entangled end chain .",
    "surprisingly , the entanglement measure correlates well with the calculated zero - bias peak intensities and positions .",
    "thus , the observation of the kondo peak at such spin chains is a direct measure of the quantum entanglement inside these chains .",
    "recently , it was possible to verify this behavior in chains constructed atom - by - atom on cu@xmath8n with one fe atom ( @xmath139 ) at the beginning and @xmath511 mn atoms ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the observations for these high - spin chains were similar to the calculations presented here .",

    "in this manuscript i have outlined how scanning tunneling spectroscopic methods can reveal the rich variety of effects individual and coupled quantum spins show when adsorbed on a supporting surface .",
    "the local environment influences the spins via crystal - field and spin - orbit coupling leading to magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , we discussed how the exchange coupling to substrate electrons can drive the total quantum state into the highly correlated kondo screening phase and how the very same interactions lead to renormalization effects influencing the anisotropy and the gyromagnetic factor .",
