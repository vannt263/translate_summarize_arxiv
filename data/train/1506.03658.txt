    "this paper may represent the first attempt to apply the singular perturbation method for stochastic differential equations in power system stability research .",
    "the proposed methodology seems promising for stability analysis as the analytical results developed are not limited by the statistic properties of wind power , specific system models , penetration level and so forth .",
    "more particularly , the proposed method can accommodate wind speed models with different distributions like rayleigh distribution , lognormal distribution , gamma distribution , etc . as a systematic method to model power systems as sdes has been proposed in @xcite , we believe that the analytical results in this paper can be readily generalized , and thus provide a unified framework to conduct stability analysis for systems with uncertainties arising from load variations and other renewable energies .    as the integration of wind power continues to grow , the concerns about its stability impacts outstand . practically speaking , power system operations on one hand concern about the variability of wind power ,",
    "whereas on the other hand regard the wind power as constant in stability analysis to reduce the computational cost .",
    "the theory - based method proposed in the paper takes the statistic properties of wind power into account , and meanwhile does not increase the computational burden .",
    "specifically , the computational cost for the proposed method is the same as the model using constant wind speed , which has been widely applied @xcite-@xcite ; the proposed deterministic model can also be easily incorporated in any dynamic model originally used in the time domain simulation . in addition , the analytical results in the paper provide an answer to the question that when the variability of wind power needs to be considered in long - term stability study , and when it does not .",
    "those results will give a practical guidance for power system stability assessments if efficient numerical schemes can be developed to check the sufficient conditions presented in _",
    "theorem 2_. for other future works , an extension of the proposed method to the stochastic long - term stability model with discrete variables is expected .",
    "in addition , the proposed method can be further improved by applying the qss model @xcite@xcite . as such",
    ", the qss model is able to incorporate wind generation into the formulation , and thus provides a more efficient computational tool to conduct long - term stability analysis for power grids with wind power .",
    "this extension of the qss model may be a valuable advance in dynamic stability analysis , considering the wide industry applications of the qss model and the continuous increasing of wind penetration .",
    "the analytical results proposed in this paper will be the foundation for those exciting subsequent works .",
    "we consider the following stochastic system : @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes a @xmath157-dimensional standard wiener process , and @xmath158 , @xmath159 are matrix - valued functions .",
    "we are interested in the case that @xmath160 does not dominate @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath161 where @xmath162 is uniformly bounded above in @xmath52 .",

    "_ 2.3 _ the diffusion matrix @xmath172 is uniformly positive definite in @xmath173 .",
    "theorem 2.4 in @xcite which is reviewed as _ theorem 3 _ as below states that under assumption 2 , the sample path of system ( [ sto_singular perburbed ] ) are concentrated in an ellipsoidal layer surrounding the invariant manifold @xmath174 of system ( [ singular perturb ] ) : @xmath175 up to time @xmath176 , with a probability roughly like @xmath177 .",
    "in particular , @xmath178 describing the cross section of the ellipsoid is well defined under assumption 2 .",
    "refer to section 2.3 of @xcite or chapter 5.1.1 of @xcite for more details .",
    "the following theorem shows that the sample paths of the stochastic system ( [ sto_singular perburbed ] ) are concentrated in a @xmath91-neighborhood of invariant manifold @xmath179 of the deterministic system ( [ singular perturb ] ) .    _",
    "theorem 3@xcite : _ under assumption 2 , for some fixed @xmath119 , @xmath120 , there exist @xmath121 , a time @xmath122 of order @xmath123 such that whenever @xmath180 , if an initial condition of stochastic system ( [ sto_singular perburbed ] ) @xmath181 where @xmath182 satisfies @xmath183 , then for @xmath128 , the following relation @xmath184:(z(\\tau),{x}(\\tau))\\notin m(h)\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\leq c_{n_{z},n_x}(\\tau,{\\epsilon})e^{\\frac{-h^2}{2\\sigma^2}(1-o(h)-o({\\epsilon}))}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] holds for all @xmath131 , @xmath132 , where coefficient @xmath185(1+\\frac{\\tau}{{\\epsilon}^2})$ ] is linear time - dependant .",
    "a matching lower bound given in theorem 2.4 of @xcite shows that the above bound is sharp in the sense that it captures the correct behaviour of the probability .",
    "_ remark 1 _ : it is shown in theorem 5.1.17 in @xcite ( remark 2.7 and lemma 3.4 in @xcite ) that the stochastic singular perturbed system ( [ sto_singular perburbed ] ) can be approximated by the reduced deterministic system : @xmath186 and the deviation between the solution of ( [ det slow ] ) and that of ( [ sto_singular perburbed ] ) is of order @xmath187 up to lyapunov time of system ( [ det slow ] ) . that means @xmath188 provides @xmath189 approximation for @xmath190 , i.e. , @xmath191 .",
    "following the deduction of @xmath178 in section 2.3 of @xcite or chapter 5.1.1 of @xcite , we can readily obtain the following results .",
    "the cross section @xmath115 of @xmath112 is the solution of the following slow - fast system : @xmath192\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 and @xmath194 is a sufficiently small positive parameter .",
    "note that the exact expression of @xmath115 is not of interest and thus does not need to be calculated , and we only need to know that @xmath115 is well defined in this formulation .",
    "_ proof : _ according to _ theorem 2 _ , if the conditions that @xmath139 and ( i)-(ii ) in _ theorem 2 _ are satisfied , then after a time of order @xmath123 , sample paths of the stochastic long - term stability model ( [ sde power ] ) are concentrated in @xmath137 which is a @xmath91-neighborhood of the invariant manifold @xmath118 .",
    "particularly , the slow dynamics of the stochastic long - term stability model ( [ sde power ] ) are in the @xmath189 neighborhood of the invariant manifold @xmath118 as explained in _ remark 1_. hence , eqn ( [ corollary3_1 ] ) and eqn ( [ corollary3_2 ] ) hold only if trajectory of the deterministic long - term stability model moves along the invariant manifold @xmath118 . on the other hand , from singular perturbation theory , we have that if the slow manifold @xmath109 is a stable component of the constraint manifold , then the invariant manifold @xmath195 exists for sufficiently small @xmath52 . moreover , if one more condition that the initial point of the deterministic long - term stability model lies inside the stability region of the initial short - term stability model is also satisfied , then there exists @xmath196 such that trajectory of the deterministic long - term stability model ( [ det power ] ) moves along the invariant manifold @xmath118 for all @xmath197 , @xmath147$]@xcite@xcite .",
