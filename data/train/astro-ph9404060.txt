    "the study of neutron star thermal evolution affords a means of probing the properties of dense matter .",
    "a newborn neutron star is very hot , with a temperature well above an mev .",
    "the star cools initially through neutrino emission , and later ( after @xmath1 yr ) cools primarily through the emission of photons from the surface .",
    "the neutrino emission process occurring in the core depends on the state of matter there . in a core composed of normal baryons ,",
    "neutrino emission can occur through the relatively slow modified urca process ( `` standard '' cooling ) , or , if the core proton fraction is high enough , through the much faster direct urca process ( `` accelerated '' cooling ) .",
    "possible states of the core include condensed pions or kaons , bulk quark matter , or hyperon - rich matter ; neutrino emission processes in each of these possible states would have accelerated rates comparable to the direct urca process .",
    "superfluid pairing of the nucleons is expected to occur below temperatures of @xmath2 1 mev , and could have a dramatic effect on neutron star thermal evolution by reducing the matter s specific heat , and , depending on the core emission processes that actually occur , the neutrino emissivity .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a neutron superfluid in the inner crust would lead to frictional heating , possibly raising the star s surface temperature significantly .",
    "generally , stellar evolution models simulating standard cooling ( _ i.e. _ , dominated by the modified urca process ) based on moderately stiff to very stiff equations of state predict surface temperatures greater than observed ; whereas models simulating the accelerated neutrino emission from an exotic or proton - rich core predict late - time surface temperatures that are far too low ( see _ e.g. , _ friman & maxwell 1979 and van riper 1991 ) .",
    "internal heating , associated with friction between the normal matter of the inner crust and a more rapidly rotating neutron superfluid , might allow agreement with data for models involving accelerated cooling , while exacerbating the problem in models of standard cooling .",
    "frictional heating has been examined by several authors .",
    "alpar ( 1987 ) assumed an approximate balance between frictional heating and photon emission from the stellar surface , and compared the predicted surface temperature with the exosat upper limit on the temperature for psr 1929 + 10 ; they concluded that only a small degree of frictional heating is allowed .",
    "shibazaki &  lamb ( 1989 ) explored the effects of internal heating on the thermal evolution of isothermal stars older than @xmath3 yr , including possible magnetic field evolution . taking the internal heating rate as a free parameter",
    ", they compared their results with einstein and exosat detections and upper limits .",
    "they found standard cooling in a stiff star to be inconsistent with the vela detection , and consistent with other pulsars for various values of the heating rate .",
    "accelerated cooling was found to predict temperatures falling below the surface temperatures of several pulsars , even for unrealistically high heating rates .",
    "van riper ( 1991a ) considered constant internal energy sources , as would occur for steady state frictional heating , in nonisothermal neutron stars .",
    "van riper , epstein , & miller ( 1991 ) showed that the heat generated during a pulsar glitch could raise the stellar surface temperature over time scales of hours to months .",
    "umeda , shibazaki , nomoto , & tsuruta  ( 1993 , hereafter usnt ) used the parametrized heating rate of shibazaki & lamb ( 1989 ) in nonisothermal simulations , and compared their results with rosat data that has recently become available .",
    "they found that standard cooling in stiff to medium stars gives temperatures that exceed those of psr 0656 + 14 and vela .",
    "moreover , strong heating in a stiff star was ruled out by psr 1055 - 52 , and possibly by the psr 1929 + 10 upper limit .",
    "the study of usnt is the most complete investigation to date , and we compare our results to theirs below .    the purpose of our study is to consider the consequences of inner crust frictional heating on neutron star thermal evolution by using a microscopic description of the superfluid coupling to the crust , rather than a parametrized form . in our analysis",
    "we use the most recent rosat data of cooling neutron stars , including the geminga pulsar detection .",
    "we investigate a standard cooling model in which the modified urca process on nucleons is the dominant cooling process in the core . as an example of an accelerated emission mechanism , we consider the quark urca process .",
    "much recent work has focused on the microscopic physics determining the coupling between the inner crust superfluid and the rest of the star ( alpar 1977 ; pines  1980 ; alpar  1984 ; epstein &  baym 1988 ; bildsten & epstein 1989 ; link &  epstein 1991 , hereafter le ; link , epstein , &  baym 1993 , hereafter leb ; chau &  cheng 1993a , 1993b ) . in this study",
    ", we examine internal heating using the microscopic description for the neutron superfluid dynamics developed in le and leb . in this theory , the frictional heating rate depends on the stellar temperature and the strength of the interactions that pin superfluid vortex lines to the stellar crust .",
    "our simulations show that accelerated cooling with frictional heating is inconsistent with the data for both young and old pulsars ; internal heating occurring at a rate consistent with the temperatures of old pulsars produces overheating in the early states of evolution .",
    "standard cooling with modest frictional heating of a very soft star ( _ i.e. , _ with a maximum mass of near 1.4 @xmath4 ) is marginally consistent with all current temperature data .",
    "stronger frictional heating produces a temperature at the age of psr 1929 + 10 in excess of the upper limit for that pulsar .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the input physics of our models ; we derive the frictional heating rate , and describe the two vortex pinning models used . in ",
    "3 we describe our numerical simulations .",
    "we compare our results with those of other authors and with data from the einstein , exosat and rosat satellites in  4 , and in  5 we present our conclusions .",
    "appendix a gives the vortex creep equations from the theory of leb .",
    "appendix b contains a comparison of our time - dependent source calculations with simulations of cooling with time - independent sources .",
    "a neutron star cools by neutrino emission from the interior and photon emission from the surface . during the first @xmath5 to @xmath6 years",
    ", the star cools mainly through neutrino emission .",
    "later , surface photon radiation dominates .",
    "the neutrino cooling rate of a neutron star is determined by the unknown state of matter in the core .",
    "depending on the mass of the star and the properties of matter at several times nuclear density , nuclear matter may extend to the center of the star , or there may exist a distinct inner core consisting of a pion or kaon condensate , hyperon - rich matter , bulk quark matter , or some other exotic state . in standard cooling models ,",
    "the neutrino emission is mainly through the modified urca process taking place in the core .",
    "later , neutrino bremsstrahlung in the inner crust may be important , though pethick & thorsson ( 1994 ) argue that band structure effects suppress this process .",
    "neutrino bremsstrahlung processes in the core also contribute to the emission .",
    "in contrast with standard models , in accelerated cooling models neutrino emissivities are orders of magnitude larger .",
    "a number of plausible accelerated cooling mechanisms have been discussed , including , the direct urca process on nucleons in a proton - rich core , free quarks , pions , or kaons .",
    "we summarize these neutrino processes in table 1 .",
    "calculations of critical temperatures for nucleon pairing ( see , , hoffberg  1970 ; chao , clark , & yang 1972 ; ainsworth , pines , & wambach 1989 ; wambach , ainsworth , & pines 1991 ) indicate that neutron stars form superfluids in their interiors shortly after their formation . in the inner crust , above the drip density of @xmath7 , free neutrons form a @xmath8 superfluid which flows through a lattice of neutron - rich nuclei . at or below nuclear density , @xmath9 , the nuclei dissolve , forming a @xmath10 neutron superfluid , plus a dilute plasma of superconducting protons and normal electrons .",
    "( recent work by lorenz , ravenhall , &  pethick [ 1993 ] and lattimer &  swesty [ 1991 ] suggests nuclei dissolve at a lower density , @xmath11 . ) superfluid may or may not extend to the center of the star .",
    "superfluidity reduces the phase space volume available for excitations . consequently",
    ", both the specific heat of the paired component , and any neutrino emission process that involves nucleons ( see table 1 ) , would be suppressed .",
    "the direct urca process on quarks would be unaffected , unless the quarks become superfluid .",
    "the possibility of quark pairing is unresolved ; in this study we assume that quark superfluidity does not occur and there is no suppression of the quark urca process .",
    "friction between the normal matter of the star and a more rapidly rotating interior superfluid leads to heat generation which affects the star s thermal evolution . the strength and time - dependence of the heat generation depends on the microscopic physics of the interaction between the superfluid and the normal matter .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of this interaction , and derive the heating rate .",
    "the angular momentum of the rotating neutron superfluid resides in a velocity field containing singular regions of vorticity or _",
    "vortex lines_. the superfluid angular momentum is determined by the density and distribution of these vortex lines , and can change only if they move relative to the star s rotation axis . were the vortex lines immobilized , by the pinning process discussed below for example , the superfluid angular momentum would remain fixed .",
    "the rotational dynamics of the superfluid , and hence , the heating associated with the coupling between the superfluid and the crust , is determined by the motion of vortex lines .    in early studies of neutron star thermal and rotational evolution , the core superfluid was assumed to be weakly coupled to the crust ( baym 1969 ; greenstein 1975 ; harding , guyer , &  greenstein 1978 ) .",
    "however , subsequent investigations of neutron star spin fluctuations showed that at least 70% of the total moment of inertia of a neutron star is strongly coupled to the crust on time scales of greater than three days ( boynton &  deeter 1979 ; boynton 1981 ) .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the entire core is strongly coupled to the crust ( alpar , langer , &  sauls 1984 ) .",
    "superconducting protons become entrained in the neutron circulation about a vortex , resulting in a supercurrent and an associated vortex magnetization .",
    "electrons scatter efficiently off the vortex magnetic field , bringing the velocity between the core neutron superfluid and the charged component of the star into corotation over time scales of @xmath12 rotation periods ( alpar &  sauls 1988 ) . on longer time scales , the core , which accounts for at least 90% of the total moment of inertia",
    "is tightly coupled to the crust .    unlike the core ,",
    "the inner crust neutron superfluid , which makes up @xmath13% of the total moment of inertia , is only weakly coupled to the crust , allowing an angular velocity difference to develop between the superfluid and the crust as the pulsar spins down .",
    "friction between the two components produces heat .",
    "the heating may occur steadily , if the superfluid and the crust slow at nearly the same rate , or suddenly , in a glitch .",
    "we now derive the internal heating rate in terms of the velocity difference between the superfluid and the rest of the star .",
    "as the star slows under an external torque @xmath14 , the angular momentum of the inner crust superfluid , @xmath15 , changes according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the moment of inertia of the solid crust and the corotating core , @xmath18 is the spin rate of the crust , @xmath19 is the total moment of inertia , and an overdot denotes a time derivative .",
    "the angular momentum of the inner crust superfluid in the newtonian approximation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the distance from the rotation axis , @xmath22 is the superfluid mass density , and @xmath23 is the superfluid velocity , related to the angular velocity by @xmath24 .",
    "the superfluid velocity changes as vortices move radially . over evolutionary time scales ,",
    "the superfluid and the crust remain close to rotational equilibrium such that @xmath25 .",
    "the total frictional heating rate is given by the rate of change of the total rotational energy of the star , minus the rate at which work is done by the external torque : @xmath26 -    = |\\dot \\omega_c| \\int \\rho_s(r ) r_p^2   ( \\omega_s ( \\vec r ) - \\omega_c ) d^3r , \\eqnum{3}\\ ] ] where we have used eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to obtain the final form",
    ". the integrand , which represents the heating rate per unit volume , is greatest near the equator and falls off near the rotational poles where @xmath21 vanishes . as we discuss below",
    ", the lag velocity between the superfluid and the crust , @xmath27 , is nearly constant on spherical shells , except near the poles .",
    "since we are studying the thermal evolution with a one - dimensional computer code , we average the superfluid heating on spherical shells to obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the effective lag frequency and @xmath30 is the newtonian approximation to the moment of inertia of a shell .",
    "this expression for the total heating rate is useful for comparison with the results of shibizaki & lamb ( 1989 ) and usnt , who write the heating rate in this form . in our thermal evolution calculations , which allow for temperature gradients ,",
    "we calculate the local heating rate in each zone , properly weighted by the moment of inertia with the general relativistic correction .",
    "the spin rate and its time - derivative are needed in the evaluation of the heating rate .",
    "we assume a magnetic dipole spin evolution , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a positive constant . integrating eq .",
    "( 5 ) from a birth spin rate @xmath33 to @xmath34 gives @xmath35 for times such that @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( 6 ) simplifies to @xmath37 where we have chosen a fiducial value of the constant @xmath32 that gives a spin down rate that is typical of the pulsars examined in this study .",
    "each pulsar s spin evolution is characterized by a value of @xmath38 ( see table 2 ) . for the numerical solutions presented below",
    ", we use @xmath39 . for a birth period of @xmath2 1 ms , eq .",
    "( 7 ) is a good approximation after @xmath2 10 yr .",
    "the velocity lag appearing in the expression for the heating rate ( eq . [ 4 ] ) is determined by the vortex mobility , since only if vortices move radially can the superfluid velocity change .",
    "interaction forces between vortices and nuclei , however , tend to _ pin _ vortices to the lattice . at high densities , above @xmath40 , the vortex  nucleus interaction is attractive , and vortices pin strongly to nuclei ( alpar 1977 ; epstein &  baym 1988 ) . at lower densities ,",
    "the interaction is repulsive , and vortices pin weakly to the interstices of the lattice ( epstein &  baym 1988 ; le ) . in either region",
    ", vortex pinning tends to maintain a local superfluid rotational velocity that is higher than that of the crust .",
    "following leb , we consider the motion of vortices by the process of _ vortex creep _ , which proceeds by thermal or quantum activation of the vortices over their pinning barriers .",
    "other mechanisms for moving vortex lines have been discussed .",
    "for example , ruderman ( 1976 ; 1991 ) argues that in regions where vortex pinning is sufficiently strong , the crust may crack before the vortices unpin , and plates of crustal material will carry vortices toward the stellar equator .",
    "jones ( 1990 ) has suggested that vortex pinning never occurs and that the superfluid remains in a state of near corotation with the crust . in leb",
    "it was shown , however , that a vortex line adjusts its configuration in such a way as to be much more strongly pinned than jones estimated .    in this investigation",
    ", we assume that vortex creep allows the superfluid to slow at the same steady rate as the crust .",
    "steady - state vortex creep , however , can not account for all aspects of pulsar timing , especially the observed glitches in spin rate .",
    "glitches are thought to reflect sudden transfers of angular momentum from the neutron superfluid to the crust .",
    "some pulsars , _",
    "e.g. _ the vela pulsar , lose angular momentum mainly during glitches , rather than through steady vortex creep . in such cases ,",
    "steady - state vortex creep is never achieved and the mean frictional heating rate is smaller than we calculate here .    from vortex number conservation , the equation of motion for",
    "the superfluid is ( see , _ e.g. , _ le ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radial vortex creep rate . in eq .",

    "( 8) to obtain @xmath46 the vortex creep rate has the general form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a microscopic velocity , @xmath49 is the activation energy for a segment of vortex line to overcome its pinning barrier , and @xmath50 is the effective temperature and which differs from the stellar value at low temperatures because of quantum effects . the leb result for the vortex creep rate is summarized in appendix a. the activation energy depends sensitively on the vortex - nucleus interaction energy ( which varies with the stellar density ) and on the difference between the velocities of the superfluid and the crust , @xmath51 . the solution of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) for @xmath52 depends only logarithmically on @xmath21 , so that @xmath52 is nearly constant on spherical shells as we assumed in obtaining eq .",
    "the strength of vortex pinning varies significantly with density in the inner crust , especially near @xmath53 , where the character of pinning changes from interstitial to nuclear .",
    "an interstitially vortex samples only the long range part of the interaction , and the pinning energies are very weak ( @xmath54 kev ) . above @xmath55 , where vortices pin directly to nuclei , the pinning energies become difficult to calculate reliably , as the vortex samples the poorly understood short - range nuclear pinning potential .",
    "we consider two models for pinning which differ in the high - density region :    * _ eb _ pinning model : le and epstein &  baym ( 1988 ) pinning parameters are used .",

    "le and epstein & baym ( 1988 ) pinning parameters are used .",
    "a calculation of the pinning interaction in the nuclear pinning region requires solving the bcs equations for pairing of neutrons in the presence of flow , both inside and outside nuclei .",

    "vortex creep will produce the most heat in the regions of nuclear pinning , since those regions have the most moment of inertia and the highest pinning energies . in the core , the velocity difference between components is negligible , and there is no significant frictional heat generation . above @xmath58 , the nuclear spacing and",
    "the characteristic vortex dimension become comparable . in this region",
    "the pinning may become  superweak \" , as suggested by alpar  ( 1984 ) , or may vanish altogether as jones ( 1991 ) argues . in either case",

    "the rapid drop in temperature does not occur until after @xmath88 yrs in our quark models because the initiation of the cooling wave is delayed by our larger early - time heating rate . at late times ,",

    "a first estimate of the effective temperature could be obtained by assuming that the star radiates as a blackbody .",

    "a star slightly stiffer than bps , as preferred by brown ( 1988 ) , while consistent with both pulsar glitch data and neutron star mass determinations , would increase the nominal discrepancy between the cooling curves and the vela detection .",

    "it appears that no combination of frictional heating and accelerated cooling is consistent with current data .",
    "( 1993 ) and page ( 1994 ) , however , have emphasized that accelerated cooling processes are suppressed by superfluidity .",

    "the surface temperature of the accelerated cooling models is mainly due to the source once isothermality obtains .",
    "the heat content of the core , which has been reduced by enhanced neutrino emission , contributes only a negligible fraction to the surface luminosity .",
    "the quark model cooling curve shows a sudden decline between 100 and 1000 years , similar to the drop caused by a cooling wave reaching the surface in a star undergoing accelerated cooling with no or weak crust heating . in our strong heating case , however , the shape of the cooling curve is controlled by the time dependence of the source rather than by the dynamics of conduction in the crust ."
