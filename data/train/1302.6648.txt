    "soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) have been discussed in terms of `` magnetar '' model , in which the activities of the neutron star are powered by the dissipation of the extremely strong magnetic field ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni 2002 ; woods & thompson 2006 ; mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the magnetar s emissions mainly appear in the x - ray bands , which are described by the blackbody component ( with hard tail ) below 10  kev plus a hard power law component above 10  kev ( kuiper et al .",
    "the power law components are often explained by the resonant compton scattering process of the mildly relativistic electrons and/or positrons below 10  kev ( fern@xmath7ndez & thompson 2007 ; rea et al .",
    "2008 ) and of the relativistic pairs above 10  kev ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ; baring & harding 2007 ; beloborodov 2012 ) , respectively .",
    "although no pulsed gev emissions from the magnetars have been confirmed , it has not been conclusive that the magnetars are intrinsically dark in the gev radiation or present sensitivity of the @xmath8 telescope is not enough to detect any pulsed gev emission from magnetars .",
    "it has been argued that the rotation powered activities of the magnetars can produce the @xmath0-rays from e.g. the outer gap accelerator ( cheng & zhang , 2001 ) .",
    "however , because temperature of the surface x - ray emissions of the magnetars is @xmath9kev , which is much higher than the typical surface temperature @xmath10  kev of the young pulsars , the size of the outer gap , and resultant power of the @xmath0-ray emissions will be relatively smaller than those of the canonical @xmath0-ray pulsars , indicating less possibility for the detection of the pulsed @xmath0-ray emissions from the outer gap of the magnetar .",
    "recently , gev @xmath0-rays from the supernova remnant ( snr ) ctb  109 , which will be associated with axp  1e  2259 + 586 , have been found in data of @xmath8 @xmath0-ray telescope .",

    "although the emissions from snr ctb  109 has been suggested ( castro et al .",
    "2012 ) , the origin has not been confirmed yet .",
    "because the future @xmath8 observations will allow us a more deep search of the gev emissions from the magnetars , it will be worth to discuss the possible mechanism of gev @xmath0-ray emissions in the magnetosphere of the magnetar .",

    "the ultra - strong surface magnetic field of the magnetars permits one - photon pair - creation process , @xmath12 ( harding & lai 2006 )",
    ". the condition of the magnetic pair - creation process occurred at a radial distance @xmath13 from the neutron star may be written down as ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is photon s energy , @xmath17 is the global dipole magnetic field at @xmath13 , and @xmath18  g is the critical magnetic field strength . in addition , @xmath19 is the electron rest mass energy and @xmath20 is the angle between the magnetic field and the propagation direction of the photon . using the dipole magnetic field , we estimate the radial distance , above which gev @xmath0-rays can escape from the magnetic pair - creation process , @xmath21 the high - energy photons may be emitted along the magnetic field line by the relativistic particles , that is @xmath22 , and hence they can initially propagate into the magnetosphere . however , because the field lines have a curvature and because the field lines are co - rotating with the magnetar , the collision angle increases as the photons propagate from the emission point . under the approximation of the concentric circles of the magnetic field line , the collision angle @xmath23 will develop as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the propagation distance from the emission point and",
    "@xmath26 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "hence , the photons emitted blow @xmath27 will be converted into pairs after they propagate @xmath28 , where @xmath29 can not be small .",

    "if gev @xmath0-rays are emitted above the radiation distance @xmath36 equations  ( [ rm ] ) and  ( [ rp ] ) imply that the critical radius @xmath37 above which the produced gev @xmath0-rays can escape from the pair - creation processes is order of @xmath38  cm .",
    "woods et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed that there are two distinct types of magnetar s bursts , which were named type  a and type  b. type  a bursts are frequently seen in sgr bursts , in that they are uncorrelated with pulse phase and the energy emitted during primary burst peak is larger than the tail energy .",
    "type  b bursts , on the other hands , are correlated with the pulse phase and the energy of primary burst peak is smaller than the tail energy ( see also kaspi 2007 ; scholz & kaspi 2011 ; dib et al .",
    "woods et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also speculated that the type  a and type  b bursts are triggered by the magnetospheric reconnection ( lyutikov 2003 ) and by the crust fractures ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , several magnetars sometimes show timing glitches that accompany the radiative outbursts ( woods et al .",
    "2004;idem et al . 2012",
    "; dib et al . 2012 ; pons & rea 2012 ) . in 2002 giant glitch of axp 1e  2259 + 586 , for example",
    ", the x - ray outburst were consisted of a rapidly decay emission in the first few hours with a released energy @xmath39 and a slow decay emission lasting several years with a released energy @xmath40 ( woods et al .",
    "2004 ; zhu et al .",
    "2008 ) , which are type  b burst .",
    "this giant glitch accompanying the radiative outburst is likely triggered by the crust fractures , which would simultaneously affect both super - fluid core and the magnetosphere , and will inject a energy @xmath41erg into the magnetosphere ( woods et al .",
    "2004 ; pons & rea 2012 ) .    in this paper , we consider the energy release caused by the crust cracking of the strong magnetic field , i.e. the type  b bursts .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field in the crust is deformed away from the equilibrium state by an amount of @xmath42 .",
    "the crust fracture will be occurred if the maxwell stress @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the equilibrium magnetic field in the crust , exceeds crustal elastic stress .",
    "the available magnetic energy density when the crust fracture is occurred may be expressed by ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the shear modulus and @xmath47 is the yield strain at which the crust cracks . the released magnetic energy is therefore estimated as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the typical size of the cracked platelet . note that with a typical luminosity of the observed x - ray emissions @xmath50 , the emission will last a temporal scale of years , @xmath51s .",
    "the process of the @xmath0-ray emission induced by the neutron star quake was discussed by blaes et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who investigated the possibility for the origin of @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "in their model , the neutron star quake will excite the oscillation of the magnetic field frozen into the star s crust , and the alfv@xmath2n waves carrying the released energy into the magnetosphere .",
    "the dissipation of wave energy will accelerate the electrons and/or positrons , which in turn radiate @xmath0-rays .    in the magnetar model",
    ", it can be thought that the alfv@xmath2n wave is excited on the magnetic field lines anchored on the cracked platelet .",
    "if location of the cracking is close to the magnetic pole , a part of the released energy @xmath52 can be carried by the alfv@xmath2n waves that propagate into the outer magnetosphere @xmath53  cm , where the @xmath0-rays can escape from the pair - creation processes .",
    "because the alfv@xmath2n wave propagates along the closed magnetic field lines , the wave may bounce many times between the footprints of the field lines .",
    "the time - averaged amplitude of the magnetic field corresponding to the alfv@xmath2n wave energy density , @xmath54 may be described as @xmath55 near the stellar surface .    as the alfv@xmath2n wave propagates from the stellar surface into outer magnetosphere",
    ", the amplitude will evolve as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the cross section of the oscillating magnetic flux tube . because the background dipole field is proportional to @xmath58 ,",
    "the ratio of the perturbed and background magnetic fields evolves with the radial distance as @xmath59    in the magnetosphere of magnetar , the speed of the alfv@xmath2n wave exceeds the speed of light , that is , @xmath60 where the @xmath61 is the mass density . in the limit of @xmath62",
    ", we can see that the required current density ( @xmath63 ) to support the propagation of the alfv@xmath2 wave at distance @xmath13 is in order of ( see appendix ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the goldreich - julian current density , and @xmath66 is the typical shear frequency of the wave , which may be estimated as @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the typical mass density in the crust .",
    "we can see that in the limit of @xmath62 , the induced electric field is same order of magnitude as the perturbed magnetic field , @xmath69 ( see appendix ) .",
    "hence , the maximum magnitude of the induced electric potential due to perturbation of the magnetic field lines may be estimated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the displacement of footprints of the oscillating magnetic lines and was estimated as @xmath72 the maximum radiation power may be estimated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the total current and @xmath75      in figure  [ mag ] , we illustrate the schematic view of our model for the particle acceleration and gev emissions in the magnetosphere of the magnetar . if the magnetic field cracks the platelet near the magnetic axis , the oscillating magnetic flux tube will extend beyond @xmath76  cm .",
    "we will argue that the particles are accelerated by the alfv@xmath2n wave , which is excited by the crust cracking of the magnetic field",
    ". it will be possible that the energy dissipation of the alfv@xmath2n wave accelerates the electrons and/or positrons to a lorentz factor above @xmath77 .",
    "the curvature radiation process of the accelerated particle can produce gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the gev @xmath0-rays emitted above @xmath76  cm will escape from the pair - creation process and may be observed as the pulsed emissions . in this section , we will discuss possible particle acceleration processes related to the propagation of the alfv@xmath2n wave .",
    "first , if the co - rotation motion is ignored @xmath78 , the induced electric field @xmath79 and the background magnetic field are a mutually orthogonal and hence no electric field along the background magnetic field is induced .",
    "however , under the presence of the co - rotation motion of the plasmas , such orthogonality breaks down , and the electric field and the current along the background magnetic field line are induced ( kojima & okita , 2004 ) .",
    "the typical strength of the electric field along the background magnetic field line , @xmath80 , is described as ( see appendix ) @xmath81 if the lorentz factor of particle is determined by the balancing the between the electric force and the curvature radiation reaction force , we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath26 is the curvature radius of the dipole field .",
    "we can see that the typical energy of the curvature photons becomes several gev , that is , @xmath83    second , the deficiency of the current ( or charge ) to support the frozen in condition , @xmath84 , could induce the electric field along the magnetic field ( see also blaes et al . 1989 ; fatuzzo & melia 1993 ; thompson 2006 ) .",
    "we can see in equation  ( [ current ] ) that the required current to support the propagation of the alfv@xmath2n wave easily exceeds the goldreich - julian current .",
    "furthermore , the typical charge density of the unperturbed particles in the closed field region will be coincide with the goldreich - julian charge density of the dipole field , that is @xmath85 . if the alfv@xmath2n wave propagates into outer magnetosphere , however , the perturbation of the magnetic field line changes the local goldreich - julian charge density as @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the electric field along the magnetic field line then will be induced , if the primary particles could not supply the required charge density @xmath88 .",
    "the particles could be accelerated at the `` charge - starved '' region up to the lorentz factor @xmath77 , such as the particle acceleration process of the @xmath0-ray pulsars ( e.g. wang , takata & cheng , 2010 ) .",
    "the accelerated particles will emit the @xmath0-rays via the curvature radiation process .",
    "most of the @xmath0-rays produced below @xmath89 will be converted into electron and positron pairs through the pair - creation processes . because the gev @xmath0-rays are emitted along the magnetic field lines , the pairs are produced at the convex side of the magnetic field line on which primary @xmath0-rays were emitted ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ mag ] ) .",
    "the multiplicity is roughly estimated as @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the fractional power spent below @xmath89 .",
    "a fraction of the created pairs is probably charge - separated , and will produce the required current ( [ current ] ) to support the propagation of the alfv@xmath2n wave .    finally if the alfv@xmath2n wave does not efficiently dissipate along the background magnetic field lines , the ratio of the amplitude of the alfv@xmath2n wave to the dipole field will evolve as @xmath92 , as equation  ( [ ratio ] ) shows .",
    "hence , we find that the fractional perturbation of the magnetic field becomes order of unity at the radial distance @xmath93^{-2/3}$ ]  cm . because the induced electric field is same order of magnitude as the perturbed magnetic field , @xmath69 , the total electric field is of order of the magnetic field @xmath94 , where conversion from the electromagnetic energy into the particles energy could be possible ( beskin & rafikov 2000 ) .",
    "when the nonlinear term becomes to be important , by whatever process , a substantial part of the wave energy is probably converted into the electron / positron energy , which in turn radiate the gev @xmath0-rays .    in any acceleration processes process discussed above",
    ", the typical lorentz factor will be characterized by @xmath95 where we used typical electric field @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the arc length of the acceleration region along the magnetic field line .      in the present scenario , the relativistic electrons / positrons , which were accelerated in outer magnetosphere , will be return to the stellar surface , because they migrate along the closed magnetic field lines .",
    "below @xmath76  cm , most of @xmath0-rays emitted by incoming particles will be converted into electron / positron pairs via the pair - creation process with the soft x - rays and/or magnetic field .",
    "those pairs are mainly produced at the convex side of the magnetic field lines , on which the primary @xmath0-rays were emitted .",
    "new born pairs will loose their energy via the synchrotron radiation and/or the resonant compton scattering , in which the compton scattering is occurred in the resonant energy @xmath98 with @xmath99 being lorentz factor of the pairs .",
    "those photons could also make new pairs .",
    "this cascade process will produce lots of low - energy electron / positron pairs near the stellar surface .",
    "the incoming pairs will carry the energy of @xmath100 .",
    "the incoming pairs eventually reach the stellar surface and heat up the stellar surface .",
    "the temperature of the heated platelet may be @xmath101@xmath102 @xmath103 kev , with @xmath104 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath105 stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "these hard x - rays emitted from the heated platelet may be too high to escape from the resonant compton scattering near the stellar surface .",
    "the scattered x - rays will be redistributed on the stellar surface , and emerge as the soft x - ray emission with a temperature of @xmath106  kev , were @xmath107 is the solid angle of the emission .",
    "it is also possible that because some fraction of the incoming pairs will be created outside the oscillating magnetic field lines that connect to the cracked platelet , the typical size of the heated surface by the incoming particles is larger than @xmath49 . in the present scenario , hence , the temperature of the intrinsic emissions from the heated surface by the incoming particles will be @xmath108kev .    for `` outwardly '' propagating gev @xmath0-rays produced near but below @xmath5  cm",
    ", the cascade process will not develop to reduce the photon energy to @xmath109mev , and stop after producing the first or second generation of pairs .",
    "for example , the first generation of pairs produced by the magnetic pair - creation process will emit the synchrotron photons with an energy @xmath110mev , where @xmath16 is the primary gev @xmath0-ray produced by the curvature radiation ( cheng et al .",
    "the outwardly propagating photons with @xmath111mev will escape from the magnetic pair - creation processes if they are produced beyond @xmath112  cm ( c.f . equation  ( [ magcon ] ) ) . between @xmath112 cm and @xmath76 cm ,",
    "hence , outwardly propagating @xmath111  mev photons emitted by the first geration pairs will escape from the magnetosphere of the magnetars , and will be contribute to the observed spectrum .",
    "we expect that the luminosity of this component will be @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the expected pulse profiles of the @xmath0-ray emissions .",

    "we apply the vacuum rotating dipole field as the magnetic field in the magnetosphere .",
    "we describe the polar angle of the magnetic field lines at the stellar surface with @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the polar angle of the last - open field line and @xmath117 is the magnetic azimuth .",
    "the open and closed magnetic field lines correspond to @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "because the polar cap radius is only @xmath1091% of the stellar radius , it is likely that the cracking platelet by the magnetic field is occurred at the closed field line region . as we discuss in section  [ region ] , the gev @xmath0-rays can escape from the pair - creation process if they are produce beyond @xmath120 cm from the stellar surface . in this section , hence , we apply @xmath121 , in which the magnetic field lines extend up to @xmath122  cm , as the main emission region .",
    "the width of the emitting magnetic flux tube in the azimuthal direction is assumed to be @xmath123  radian , because the typical size of cracked platelet is @xmath124 cm , where @xmath125  radian is the polar angle of the magnetic field lines that extend beyond @xmath126 cm .",

    "the crossing time scale of the alfv@xmath2n wave , @xmath128s with @xmath129 being the speed of the alfv@xmath2n wave , is much shorter than the rotation period . to calculate the pulse profile , hence",

    "the pulsed gev @xmath0-ray radiation from the magnetars have not been reported yet , although the predicted luminosity @xmath182 may be large enough to detect pulsed gev @xmath0-rays by the @xmath8 telescope . however",
    ", several reasons can be raised to explain the non - detection of the pulsed gev emissions from the magnetars .",
    "first , the magnetars are in general located at the galactic plane , the background radiation may prevent the detection of the pulsed radiation .",
    "second , the magnetars have shown frequent glitches that are sudden changes in frequency and/or frequency derivative ( idem et al . ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "hence the timing parameters of the magnetars are very unstable , which makes even harder to detect the pulsed period in the @xmath8 data .",
    "third , it has become clear that the magnetars are associated with the snrs ( allen & horvath , 2004 ; gaensler et al . 2005 ; halpern & gotthelf 2010 ) .",
    "it is possible that @xmath0-ray emissions from snrs dominate the pulsed emissions in the data .",
    "recent @xmath8 observations have revealed properties of the gev radiations from snrs ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "for the young snrs , the accelerated electrons at the forward shock may produce the gev radiations through the inverse - compton process , while for middle age snrs , the interaction between the accelerated protons and ambient molecular clouds produces the bright gev radiations via the @xmath183 decay process .",
    "we note that the typical luminosity of gev radiation of snrs is order of @xmath184 , which is same order of magnitude predicted by the present magnetosphereic emission model .",
    "hence , it would be possible that the gev emissions in the direction of magnetars are composed of the emissions from snrs and magnetospheres .",
    "the pulsed radiation predicted by the present scenario will change its luminosity level @xmath185 at a temporal scale of years after the energy injection into the magnetosphere , while the snr s emission will be stable .",
    "hence , a temporal behavior of the observed gev emissions will discriminate between the two components .",
    "finally we note that it has been proposed that the glitch of normal pulsars is caused by unpinning of the super - fluid vortices from the lattice ( alpar 2001 ) . the energy released by the glitch",
    "is deposited at inner crust , and most of energy is dissipated to heat up the entire star ( tang & cheng 2001 ) .",
    "the increases of the surface x - ray emission may affect the gamma - ray emission because of the photon - photon pair - creation process . with a typical released energy @xmath186erg , the glitch can increase surface x - ray emissions by a factor of 2 - 3 if the core temperature is @xmath187k for old pulsars or only a few percent if @xmath188k for young pulsars ( tang & cheng 2001 ) .",
    "hence , it is expected such small change of the surface emission does not change much the @xmath0-ray fluxes for young pulsars , e.g. crab and vela . for the magnetar case ,",
    "on the other hand , the cracking of the outer crust could trigger the glitches that accompany the radiative outburst .",
    "a part of the released energy is carried into the magnetosphere via alfv@xmath2n waves , and may be used to accelerate the particles , which results in the gev @xmath0-ray emissions .",
    "-ray emissions from magnetars .",
    "the figure represents snap shot at which the alfv@xmath2n wave propagates from the north pole to south pole .",
    "the gev @xmath0-rays produced above @xmath38  cm can escape from the pair - creation process .",
    "the created pairs below @xmath37 eventually heat up the stellar surface and will contribute to the soft x - ray emissions from the stellar surface .",
    "some of outwardly propagating 100  mev photons emitted via the synchrotron radiation of the first generation of pairs will also escape from the pair - creation process , if they are produced beyond @xmath189cm.,width=377,height=377 ]    -ray emissions for the inclination angle of @xmath131 and @xmath121 .",
