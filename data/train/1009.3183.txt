    "they found that two randomly connected networks with arbitrary degree distributions randomly coupled by bidirectional dependency links completely disintegrate via a cascade of failures if the fraction @xmath11 of the nodes which survive the initial attack is less than some critical value @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the transition at @xmath5 is of the first order type , i.e. the fraction of the functional nodes @xmath3 which survive after the cascade of failures has a step discontinuity at @xmath4 changing from @xmath13 for @xmath4 to zero for @xmath14 .",
    "this behavior was observed even for scale free ( sf ) networks with a power law degree distribution @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is based on the fact that in that model the nodes with large degree ( hubs ) in one network may depend on the nodes with small degree in another network .",
    "the nodes with small degree can be isolated from a giant component in one network by removal of a small fraction of nodes and thus cause the malfunction of the hubs in the other network . in real world",
    "interacting networks , the hubs in one network are more likely to depend on the hubs of another networks .",
    "this can significantly enhance the robustness of the interdependent networks .",
    "in general , the correlations among the degrees of the mutually dependent nodes can be described by a matrix @xmath17 which specifies the conditional probabilities to find a node with degree @xmath18 in one network , provided it depends on a node with degree @xmath19 in another network .",
    "this matrix can be quite complex and may depend on many parameters .",
    "for each parameter set the model can be readily studied by computer simulations , but in order to get general understanding of the correlation effects it is desirable to solve the problem analytically at least in some limiting cases .    in this paper",
    "we study the mutual percolation problem in the case of the strongest possible correlations , namely we studied the case in which both networks ( a and b ) have the same number of nodes @xmath0 connected by bidirectional dependency links establishing a one - to - one correspondence between the nodes of the two networks in such a way that mutually dependent nodes have the same number of connectivity links , i.e. their degrees coincide , i.e. @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "this implies that both networks have the same degree distribution @xmath1 . for brevity we will call such networks correspondently coupled networks ( ccn ) , while we will refer to the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as randomly coupled networks ( rcn ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the nodes in each network are randomly connected .",
    "we define the mutually connected clusters and the mutual giant component as in ref .",
    "@xcite and assume that only the nodes which belong to the mutual giant component remain functional .",
    "we assume that initially a @xmath2 fraction of nodes are randomly removed due to an attack or failure and find analytically the fraction of nodes @xmath3 which belong to the mutual giant component .",
    "we find that as in ref .",
    "buldyrev , the system undergoes a percolation transition at certain fraction @xmath4 which , however , is always smaller than the @xmath5 for rcn with the same degree distribution with the exception of random regular graphs  @xcite for which both values coincide .",
    "moreover , we find that the system undergoes a first order transition at @xmath23 if the degree distribution has a finite second moment . for the practically imqportant case of sf networks@xcite with @xmath24 , for which the second moment diverges , the transition becomes a second - order transition . if @xmath8 we find that @xmath9 as in percolation of a single network@xcite , while for @xmath10 we find an exact analytical expression for @xmath23 .",
    "the change in transition order has been also observed in interdependent networks with partial coupling @xcite .",
    "we also investigate how the broadness of the degree distribution affects the robustness of ccn .",
    "we will describe the stages of the cascade of failures in ccn in terms of the generating function of their degree distribution  @xcite @xmath25 and the generating function of the associated branching process  harris1 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average degree .",
    "it is known that the degree distribution @xmath28 of a network , from which a fraction of nodes @xmath2 is randomly removed is related to the original distribution @xmath1 through a binomial expansion  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] are binomial coefficients .",
    "accordingly  @xcite , the generating function of this distribution is @xmath31 the fraction of nodes which do not belong to the giant component of a network is given by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a smallest nonnegative root a transcendental equation @xmath34 the degree distribution of nodes which do not belong to the giant component is given by @xcite @xmath35 accordingly the degree distribution of nodes in the giant component is given by @xmath36 thus the degree distribution in the giant component of a decimated network after random removal of a @xmath2 fraction of nodes is @xmath37/[1-r(p)].\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 satisfies the transcendental equation @xmath40 in order to find the original degree distribution in the giant component of network a we must restore the links which lead to the randomly removed nodes .",
    "if a node in the decimated network a has a degree @xmath41 it might have any degree @xmath42 in the original network a with probability @xmath43 given by the bayes formula : @xmath44 thus the total probability that a node in the giant component has a degree @xmath45 is @xmath46 or using eq .",
    "( [ tildepi ] ) @xmath47 the generating function of this degree distribution is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the fraction of nodes in the giant component of the decimated network a is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , because the decimated network has @xmath53 nodes , the size of the giant component a@xmath54 of network a after random removal of @xmath55 nodes is @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that only nodes which belong to a@xmath54 are functional ; thus after the first stage of the cascades of failures , only @xmath57 fraction of nodes in network b remain functional .",
    "thus we expect further disintegration of network b at the second stage of the cascade and its giant component b@xmath58 will be even smaller than a@xmath54 .",
    "we define a set of nodes b@xmath59a@xmath60 by projecting a@xmath54 onto network b using the one - to - one correspondence @xmath61 between the nodes of networks a and b established by dependency links .",
    "since the degree of each node in network b is the same as the degree of its dependent node in network a , the giant component a@xmath54 of network a obtained at the first stage of the cascade has the same degree distribution as the set b@xmath54 in network b. moreover , from the point of view of network b the nodes in b@xmath54 are randomly selected and randomly connected .",
    "thus , to compute b@xmath58 we can use the same approach used at the first stage , but applied to the new network b@xmath54 with the new degree distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) .",
    "the only problem is that many of the links outgoing from network b@xmath54 are ending at the nodes which do not belong to network b@xmath54 and thus for computation of b@xmath58 these links must be removed .",
    "the probability @xmath62 of a random link originating in network b@xmath54 to end up in b@xmath54 is equal to the ratio of the number of links originating in network b@xmath63 : @xmath64 to the total number of links @xmath65 .",

    "we can again apply the same technique , with the only difference that now a@xmath84b@xmath85 is not a random subset of nodes of a but they are taken out of its connected giant component a@xmath82 . accordingly , we must find an effective degree distribution and the effective size of a network which would reproduce a@xmath83 by random selection of nodes out of this original network .",
    "since the degree distribution of nodes in a@xmath86 is @xmath87and the degree distribution in a@xmath83 is @xmath88the selection of a@xmath83 out of a@xmath82 has the same effect as random selection of a fraction @xmath89 out of the entire network with degree distribution @xmath90 .",
